0,"I hate a lot about my appearance, but even more than that I hate having an appearance to begin with. I hate having a physical form that other people can see, that I can see and feel. It's like I'm trapped inside my own body, like I should be able to reach inside of it and pull me out but no matter how hard I try I just... can't. I feel as if I will never be happy because I will never be able to be who I am within the confines of this prison and that no matter how much I can try to change things about my body, it'll still be a body. And that's the whole problem.

Why do I feel this way? Is there some sort of term for it, something that can adequately describe what is going inside of my mind? Does anyone else here struggle with the same thing?

Please help me.",25Oct2020,1

2,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’ve been in 10x worse situations than I’m in now and I’ve been fine but a week ago I just got hit by a sudden wave of sadness. I feel hopeless and I just don’t feel like getting anything done. I’m still able to get stuff done but once I’m done with the essentials I just go and lay in bed. I’ve started pushing my friends away. Not being mean to them but just talking to them less. I feel like I’m annoying them and so I don’t talk to them. I am just curled up in a ball and I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I just feel like nothing is in my control and I’m not worth anything even though I know I am?

3,"This might sound strange. I will be creating situations and stories in my head but I can tell it’s in my head because my thoughts are talking (if that makes sense.) but every time I get into it I hear a short laughter in my right ear because it’s TOO real it’s not in my head.  I literally jump because how real it is. Plus it’s the same laughter every time! 

And I’ve been having a habit of thinking “if I don’t eat my food when the adverts end I’m going to die.” Or “if I don’t get to the lamp post in 10 seconds I’m going to die.” Is that normal??

5,"First of all, this is a second account (cause my GF has my main) but please don’t remove this post, I need this. Also, I don’t feel comfortable sharing my age, so I won’t.

My mental health is spiraling downwards and almost nothing helps. The only times I feel good are when I’m with my girlfriend, and I can’t see her often, only once or twice a month. Now yes, I know many people can’t get girl/boy friends, but I did, and I love her. She knows about my issues but I haven’t told her how bad they have gotten. She has issues herself (she has considered suicide multiple times) and is currently getting help, and I’m so proud of her, but I can’t do the same. I’m scared to tell my mom and I’m currently Self-harming, but nobody knows about that. I’m scared of myself and I don’t want to be sent somewhere where I can’t talk to any of my 2 friends, because that will make it worse. I’m stuck and I don’t know what to do, please, any advice/help/ideas are welcome. I’m in the US and I’m not even an adult.

6,"So growing up wasn’t the best time for me and my parents used to fight a lot (a lot of screaming) I also grew up with bullying and it general wasn’t a good time for me. My parents eventually spilt up and now in present time my mum drinks a lot and I hate it. I wouldn’t say I grew up in a household that didn’t love me just the time I would hug my mum is when I went to bed when I was younger but on the other hand I was genuinely was more comfortable giving my dad hugs and I still am to this day. 

Me and my mother go through a lot of mental health issues. I wouldn’t say I grew up in a household that would emotionally neglect me but I feel like I have when I was younger. I’ve been struggling with anxiety and depression for the past I’d say 4-5 years now and in that space it was constant arguing with my mum and refusing to go to school for about 2-3 years. 

Now that I’ve kinda summed it up when my mum hugs me out of the blue or tries to give me affection I get extremely uncomfortable,my heart races super fast, a lot of panicking and feels like I’m going to have a panic attack. I’ve told my mum not to do this and she said she wouldn’t. For a while this worked but now she’s doing it again after I’ve told her many time not to. When she does this my immediate response is that I shout and physically have to push her off since she doesn’t when I ask her to please get off me multiple times. I feel bad when I do this and I hate myself for it and I’m just lost. 

I feel like I’ve got a form of autism or maybe adhd but I’m not sure so who knows. Anyways I don’t know if this is normal please help me out thank you",25Oct2020,1
7,"Apologies in advance for length.

I have always had a weird relationship with my family. When other people say they ""love"" their family members (or whoever it is they love) I can tell that they mean it. I tell my mother I love her sometimes, but a lot less than I used to (I'm 20m, for context). When I say I love my family members, I'm not sure that I mean it. I certainly trust them to a greater degree than other people, and am more familiar with them, but ""love"" seems like the wrong word.

When I was 9, my aunt died very tragically at a young age. My entire family (extended) was torn up about it. My mother couldn't stop crying, and my aunt was her brother's wife. They weren't even blood relations, and my mother was crying like she'd lost her own sister. I, on the other hand, didn't really feel anything. I knew it was a sad situation, and it scared me a little bit, but I didn't necessarily *feel* sad. 

I was keenly aware of my lack of emotion at the time. 9 year old me put it down to the fact that I was young, and young people don't always know how to deal with things (which I still think was kind of funny for me to be thinking at the time). 

As I got older, I avoided close encounters with death for quite some time. It wasn't until just over two years ago, when my grandfather passed, that I had to deal with a death in the family again. I assumed I would deal with it differently this time. However when he died, I once again briefly got that vaguely scared feeling, a feeling of finality. Then I was fine. Completely fine. There had been a long build-up to his death, so we had been preparing ourselves, but it was during the summer with beautiful weather etc. and I was loving it. All the family were together and I felt like I was having a blast. His death didn't really bother me at all, except that I was disappointed that I didn't have time to talk to him more. (We didn't start having real adult conversations until the last year or two of his life). 

My cousins, by contrast (I'm an only child) were clearly shaken by his death. He was the family patriarch, and he left a pretty big void.

Stuff like this makes me consider the difference between sympathy and empathy. I could *sympathise* with my family in that I could kind of understand what they were going through. But I couldn't *empathise*. I felt inert in comparison to their obvious and profound sadness. 

It's similar for me in relationships. I have historically found it very difficult to care about someone to a degree where I would put their needs before mine. Only recently have I begun to feel like I *could* feel that away about a person (my bf). This is progress, for sure, but I feel like I should be able to not always want to suit myself first. I am often very selfish, sometimes aggressively so, and I don't really know why.

Sorry for the meandering post, but I'll try and focus it into a question or two:

\- Is it normal to feel a significant lack of empathy for others?

\- Is it possible to make myself want to help somebody, rather than feeling that urge naturally?

9,"I really don't know where to start or what to say even. I have a normal family upper-middle-class and everything. My financial needs were always covered. From an emotional and parental standpoint, they did their best I think but it is safe to say that they did not know how to cope with child emotions and all that but they did their best you know every parent is a damaged human too so they did their best and I am lucky to be their son. I was diagnosed with ADHD in 4th grade my medication was like one Ritalin and 2 of 54 concerta so I imagine this is a high dose.

&amp;#x200B;

All my life when people asked me what do you wanna be, what is your dream. I just answered, ""to be happy"". All my life i valued my friends really much i considered them as my own and be there for people but as i grow older life showed me that i actually have no friends. I just have people i know to hang out for a beer a game or whatever but no real connection to anyone. Maybe my expectations of friendship is high i really do not know. Ever since i know myself i am the person who cheers people like the one guy with the smile, being ""friends"" with people in an instant, ice breaker of a new founding social circle and all that crap. But lately, i just noticed that i may not be that person. I think i just took that role because i needed the reactions i got from people which would give me the attention i seek and the fuckin dopamine that my brain needs so desperately. I never had a deep life goal i am always just flying with the wind, wherever it may take me and so far wind was in my favour. I am in a city which i love having a scholarship masters program (ıt seems fancy but it is not i don't even study to anything and i somehow pass).

&amp;#x200B;

I had some good women in my life; girlfriends, friends with benefits and all that. I always felt better sleeping cuddled with someone ı always felt like things are fine when i do that and also it would keep the depressive and suicidal thoughts away. I also had some neediness with women sometimes it is probably because i have no one to talk to about these things so eventually i open up to someone and it always comes out as needy and everyone i opened up to ended up leaving my life somehow.

&amp;#x200B;

As long as i knew myself i knew something was off. It is like i am not whole as i am and i need to find stuff to fill the hole. I stuff it with fitness, drinking with""friends"" cheering making jokes having a smiley face, traveling, a romantic partner, if i get lucky sex, playing an instrument, a lot of series and movies. But the hole gets used to them and they don't seem enough after some point. These depressing and suicidal thoughts were always coming and going since like middle school but for the last 7 8 months, they are much more intense.

&amp;#x200B;

I try to help people sometimes asking if they are doing fine and they could talk to me if they needed and all that. I just wish maybe someone was there to do me the same. It kinda became a life motto. ""everything i did not get to have, i am gonna give it to someone because i know what it is like to not have it."" I see people on the streets smiling laughing being with a loved one and i get so happy for them because they have those things they are not lacking them like me(at least that is what it seems from outside god knows what happens inside their heads). I don't think i got jealous of them but fuck do i know maybe i am.

&amp;#x200B;

I just do not have the same motivation or energy to go talk to people anymore. I just keep myself in my room try to learn new things or acquire new habits that will somehow give me a purpose to make me better or even just keep me afloat and alive. I even fail at them and end up eating shitty food binge watching shit masturbating and etc.. I do not enjoy the same from hanging out with ""friends"" anymore. ı am not as excited and as motivated. It is like ""yeah i am here time is passing at least"". I keep myself at my room sometimes even though I am hungry ı do not go to the kitchen to prepare food because one of my flatmates is there and I would have to talk to them if I go. So I just wait in the room and see when they will leave the kitchen.

&amp;#x200B;

I am having free therapy sessions from my scholarship program but even though my therapist is really nice and supportive i do not think that goes anywhere too. I tried getting medication from another psychologist and the drug made me terrible like a zombie always sleepy and all that so i stopped using it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do not smoke but i smoke marijuana sometimes well it could be ""sometimes "" 4 5 months ago but now since 4 5 months i smoke everyday. I put really low dosage 4 5 joints a day. I don't know why i am doing it i do not even get high anymore. I always had sleeping problems too from time to time and it is the worst since i am alone with my thaughts tired but not able to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

The funny part is no one could ever notice it. Everyone knows me as a cheerful not fuckin care for the world kind of guy, the guy who always has the energy to do anything. But that is just all an act. An act which i have perfected through my childhood without knowing it was an act and still playing the same act out of habbit or just because i do not know any better. I sometimes say ""ı am all alone"" in my mother tongue out loud out of nowhere. It happens just when i am alone. I  dont know why but i cant even cry tears just wont fall.

&amp;#x200B;

My masters is gonna finish this year and i have no fuckin clue what to do with my life. I took this master program not because of academic or career persuits but because of not knowing what to do with my life and escaping my home country ( the conditions are not the best in my country so i came to Europe to find something and make a life here). I know the state i am in is not compateable with working life. I need to sort these out or i will not even have life itself. I sometimes wish that i would die while saving someones life or just die in a car crash that way either my life would save someones or i would have a normal death not suicide. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now it seems like the only thing that is keeping me from suicide is that i can not make my parents and younged brother go through that stuff. My younger borther takes me as a role model i notice it he really seeks my attention and when i say something he takes it really seriously. That is why i never shared him my religious views i did not wanted to affect his decisions. Probably thats why there was always this distance between us a Wall that i unintentionally created because i did not wanted him to get closer to me and see what kind of situation i am in at least that is my theory on it.

&amp;#x200B;

I also wish that i had something that i believe in not only religion but an idea would do too. If i believed something from the heart that would give me a reason to live. I could be a politician if i had a strong political idea, I could be religion man if i was a part of any religion, an academic career desire but i dont have anything like that. I also know that money or possessions won't make me happy either because i had what i needed as a child and a young adult and it didn't fill the hole inside me. So i can not see a point in working and getting money too cause money won't fix me.

&amp;#x200B;

So i guess this is it. Even i don't know what is my problem the cause of it or anything. But these are what is happening. ı wish i had a reason to be this way as i said i had good standards comparing to most, no childhood trauma that i know of and all that but here we are. I just do not have anyone to talk this with. Just thought i would let it out somewhere as i scrolled through. I don't even think that anyone would read this long ass not knowing what he is talking about post. Yeah, i guess that is it. I hope you have better mental health than mine.",25Oct2020,1
10,"Bascially a year ago in March my brother went through it he start hallucinating ( according to my parents I was at university at the time) the word schizophrenia by a psychology but my brother wasn't diagnose he was going to get checked at a mental hospital but according to my parents the medicine he was on at the time made him like a vegetable which I could believe at this point he was never violent . He was ""healed"" and then everything went back to normal like it was a bad dream. Then this year because I'm quarantine I'm at home but then it start again. My brother would hold his face and then pace up and down without sleeping for days somethings now because I'm doing online school my parents really dependent on me to take of him during the day and that was okay with me. My brother wasn't okay by any means my parents still send him to school that some might argue wasn't the idea which I did... But my parents dealt with this before and they sent him in worse states to school according to them. So off he goes. Only problem is he starts becoming worse. On this random day my brother runs out underwear and pj top gets his school bag and runs down the street he is going to school but here's the thing it wasn't a school day for him due to COVID19 he has school 3 or 2 days a week rotating. My parents go to work like I said his never been violent. I wasn't sleeping at night because he was up all night keeping me up in the process so I went back and in the process took the keys so he couldn't run outside because he does that sometimes. When I wake to ask brother like any other day I get to stop pacing and to sit down and watch TV under a blanket just for a bit and then give him food until he start pacing or just standing on one spot but on this day my brother had the bicycle and tools out he was making a science experiment I immediately took all the sharp knifes and through them under my bed I just had a feeling not the butter ones my brother wasn't himself but he start developing this thing where he talks in English (which our main language) and second language I'm not fluent in but understand but like it's two different people he was talking about gangs and whatnot  (my brother is gentle spirit 15 year old boy), so he has the  butterknife I ask him to please give it to me and he immediately holds my body leaving with the inability to move and throws me on my bed a bit weird but not necessarily violent, so I go back and ask him for the knife and he does this again but this time covering my nose and mouth I'm trying to fight and scream as hard as I can my neighbor comes out and he randomly says in this other language (I'm not raping her). Call my dad he comes home I was filming the whole thing I was crying and my dad just brushes it off and kind of laughed at me I explained that I genuinely thought I was going to die because there was a time I really couldn't breath. But that night my brother unfortunately did the same thing to my father and throw him to the ground putting his entire on him my brother is strong and bigger than my dad but he was so strong he could over power all three of us. Second time my dad was driving the car my brother and I in the back seat trying to get him to calm down. My brother at this point  trashed the house by mixing all out groceries and putting all the kitchen all other the sitting and  living room on the walls counchs (at this point we locked him in a room and he destroyed his door with a cricket bat comepetly broke the wood) you name, punch is hand through a window and broke a man's wind shed wiper after running away. So we are the back sit I'm trying to tell brother to calm down he hits and jumps out the car. We were siting on the couch at this point I was feeding him and dressing hand and he punchs me in the face I've never been hit like that before and my brother run and locked himself in the kitchen. Lastly my brother had this metal stick that he broke off of a metal dust pan and I just could tell that something bad was happen  with a baseball bat a tried to take the stick away from him I wasn't going to hit him I just though he would put the stick down in the past he would sometimes get scared and stop doing something  ((big mistake)) I just wanted to scare him he physically overpowered me and beat my while I was in fetal position I just remeber him hitting my head so many times and then my legs and I just remeber crying. And he threaten my mom with the bat this was kick my parents need to go seek help. My sweet gentled brother hit me several times and even though I don't blame cause he wasn't himself. It's almost a month later my brother isn't here and being selfish I know but I'm anger with no one to be angry at. My mom didn't want to get him help because she convinced it was demons (my mom is educated women so this was shocking to me, she still says my brother sold his soul to the devil?????) my brother has blamed everyone at this point for my brother being ""sick/being put dark magic on??) her long time friends, neighbors and her coworkers. I know deep down its just a defence mechanism and as miss guided it was my mom tried everything I know she's struggling because she doesn't want to accept the harsh reality of the situation.



This is alot but I was hit and I was made to feel like my life is in danger but I don't have anyone to blame. I feel like victim but without a perpetrator. I have no one to be upset no one to a sign blame too. My brother was only 14 and now 15 years he doesn't deserve this. This isn't flair he's smart, kind and funny but all anyone is going to see is his mental illness. Why did this happen. It just isn't fair.",25Oct2020,1

I'm only 19 but I've been ready and willing to die since I was like 10. I cannot imagine myself in the future. I am incredibly reckless... I'm addicted to getting high, and I already knew I was high risk for addiction and I fucking did drugs anyway like a dumbass. I've been getting intoxicated in any way I can every day for a few months. I don't want to stop. Being sober makes me want to kill myself.

The problem is, I have no desire or motivation to help myself. I don't think I ever have. Are some people just unhelpable? Am I hopeless? I don't ever try to improve my mental health when I see a therapist. I haven't had one since March, but even then it wasn't helping. 

The state of the world has me more hopeless than ever. I'm LGBT and I fear the upcoming election. Neither candidate wants to protect my rights. I can legally be denied health care. I'm not a healthy person and I am in pain a lot of the time. 

I crave intimacy but I can't do anything anymore. I want a relationship but I haven't met anyone with any mutual attraction in 3 years. I'm too scared for dating apps and I fear that a partner won't go as slow as I need them to. I was sexually abused by multiple people for multiple years. I cannot have sex. What the fuck am I worth as a partner if I can't have sex with them? I'm incredibly unstable and I offer nothing. I have no hope for myself at all. I cannot see myself in the future.

I've also got hella invasive thoughts. Today I almost threw up because I couldn't get the image out of my head of me bludgeoning my own mother to death. I can't even just exist and see things. Every time I hold a knife or anything like it, I think about stabbing myself or someone, or even my pets. I scare the fuck out of myself with all this.

The only thing keeping me alive is the lack of an effective method and my spite to outlive Trump. I know I won't give a shit about who I leave behind if I'm dead. I just really want to die so bad all the time.",25Oct2020,1

1.

Sometimes I have this “blackout” moment where I KINDA know what I’m doing, but, can’t remember? It’s weird I can’t really explain.

I don’t currently have a therapist or even an adult in my life to ask about this, but the feeling is starting to eat away at me. Every so often I enter an out of body state, kind of viewing myself in the third person and feeling as if my body and brain are 2 separate entities. It’s kind of difficult to explain but it feels like I’m outside of my body and looking in, and I’m unable to show emotion and have very slow reaction time. I sometimes become unable to reply to stimulus or to other people who are talking to me. Over time this has caused me to have episodes where I become afraid of the outside world and become physically sick, absolutely disgusted even, with people around me and reality. During these episodes I feel terribly afraid of looking at text and anything man made to the point I can’t open my eyes.

27,"When I try to talk to my family about my depression and ask for help, they brush me off and dont take it seriously, or bring up their own problems and I end up just helping them. When I tried to reach out to my only friend, he didnt respond and I feel like he stops responding any time the conversation gets the least bit personal, so I've taken the hint.
I called a place that offers 24/7 counseling either online or in person, assessments, referrals, etc, and they advertised having psychiatrists, therapists, RPN's, addiction counselors, pharmacists, RN's, etc. The lady who answered didnt seem like she understood what I was asking and didnt care to find out. I tried to explain that I wanted to see a psychiatrist so I could get a diagnosis as well as come up with a treatment plan with them, that's what I did almost 10y ago when I was first diagnosed with depression/anxiety, and told her I was struggling to do that because I dont have a family dr to get a referral. She pretty much told me there wasnt anything they had to offer for me and told me to find a family dr and to speak to them. I've been trying for a while and it's been near impossible. Doing it that route with take me months between appointments, different referrals, and other bs. She seems so not interested in helping me that I hung up. I even got my mom to call before me to make sure they were friendly and see if they even had what I was looking for, and they told her they did. I dont get why I was brushed off like that.

Do I call back and hope I get a different person who'll actually help? I suck at putting my feelings and thoughts into words and I sometimes genuinely dont know how I feel. I think people think I'm just not interested in getting help, but I am. I just dont know what's wrong with me and can't explain it.",25Oct2020,1
28," f14 have developed severe anxiety about leaving my house. I never really went out much in the first place but it's gotten horrible. Over quartine, I've gotten way too attached to the comfort of my room. I don't like being watched by other people. Even if no one is there I feel as if I'm being watched and judged. I can't even go in my backyard which is fenced. I don't have a very busy neighborhood either, I live on a pretty quiet street. I didn't really notice my fear until about a month ago when I started to feel suffocated in my room but I couldn't stand the thought of leaving it. I just really want to go and walk down my street but every time I think about going outside I get really scared and feel like crying. I can feel it getting worse too. I get anxious about going to the kitchen to eat or drink water if I know someone in my family is home. I don't know what to do. I miss going outside. I used to have a rabbit that hung out in the backyard a lot and I'd spend time with him but he died two months ago. I can't tell anyone in my family because I'm really embarrassed about it.

30,"I hate growing up it’s so depressing. Granted I’m 18 and starting my first year in college in a dorm Im only starting to transition into adulthood. But growing up when you had/have a dysfunctional family hurts so much more. 
My family never ate together cause it would always end in yelling and there was generally always tension. ATM the only good thing that i remember and miss is being able to eat my moms food and be able to hug her randomly since physical affection wasn’t common (yes I’m touch starved). 
But now I’m alone and haven’t had a real homemade meal in months since all i have to work with Is a sink. Each person of my family also lives in a different house too and i have to sneak around and have different members argue and plan who gets to have me when. 
It just hurts that I’ll never be able to have any sort of semblance of what family is.

31,"It's getting closer to winter and I feel myself becoming depressed again. It happens every year like clockwork and I just don't get it.

I had an odd day when I had particularly high energy, and I went in to D.T class. I've always had a slight fear of the belt sanders and other power tools but it's never affected me that much, but that day I was terrified. I was shaking and crying and I could hardly talk or move after the teacher just turned the vacuum on.

34,"Hello! Just for some background info, I have been formally diagnosed with ADHD for nearly 10 years and have been medicated for it. For the past several years, I have had a tendency to obsess over certain negative anxiety inducing thoughts. This could range from recent mistakes in social conversations to years old issues. It typically happens when I’m alone, and I compulsively say things out loud such as “I hate myself” or “I wish I was dead.” I know I genuinely don’t mean these sort of things, but the compulsion to say them almost provides me with some sort of relief when I do utter them verbally. I don’t think I have Tourette’s syndrome or anything like that, because I can suppress them fairly easily when I’m in front of people. Does anyone else have these sort of issues and how do you best handle them?",25Oct2020,1

So whenever I’m going through a like mental breakdown or whatever,

...I want to get rid of pictures of myself (I have a Polaroid wall), I want to remove all mirrors and reflective surfaces or things, I don’t what to see myself. I basically hate myself and my reflection/image so much. If I see my self (in pictures or a reflection), I hate myself even more. 

It’s an undescribable feeling of self hate. I just want to stick my head/face in a hole and never see myself again...

40,"I've seen a counsellor (and talked to a few) about this question but they always say ""just don't worry"" or ""being alone is better than being with bad company"" and I feel like it doesn't solve my problem.

COVID has made me super lonely. I see my Mom and my bf. I do go to work, but they're all negative and there's rarely one nice thing said. I'm super lonely with COVID and now I'm alone all day. I do school online, I work a little bit a week, but otherwise it's just me. I throw myself into homework because it's a busy semester.

My friends are all too busy or only want to bother with me if they need something, so reaching out doesn't work. My family is too busy with work or too stressed to care. My BF is burnt out and whenever I ask for help he just gets upset and tells me he's bending over backwards and I should just be happy. I just want a hug, or a conversation... It's like I'm never enough anymore. 

How do you find people? I need friends or random people to talk to. I'm tired of feeling alone around people. I'm tired of not feeling like enough. ""Not feeling alone"" isn't as easy as the counsellors say and ""just don't worry about what people think"" doesn't help either.",25Oct2020,1
41,"I've had this since I was a kid. It mainly came from the constant hospital visits because of my poor health and being distant from my parents for unknown amounts of time. I could never stay at an aunties/uncles/grandparents or friends until years later even though their house would be opposite to mine. I'd kick and scream if they made me go to my aunties. If it was a friends i'd always have a breakdown and not go.

However, now i'm 18. I'm an adult so I feel like I should be over this right? I mean, i've got better. I can stay at my one grandparents place as i'm very close to them but only for so long and even then it can feel difficult, I can stay at my best friends place, its broadened a bit more. Unfortunately, its still a very real and distressing thing for me. It was my friends birthday not too long ago and today she wanted us to meet and have a few drinks (I'm not a drinker, i'll have very little). All week I had felt odd about it. Day prior I was feeling the anxiousness kick in and then today I felt too sick to eat, to stand/walk for a certain amount of time. Kept edging towards a panic attack. I wanted to bail so so bad but my mom insisted that I was going and I was in fear that i'd let down my friends so I forced myself.

I got a bit better as sleeping round the house wasn't exactly a 100% thing but now it is. I feel too rude to leave, its too late anyway as its almost 3am. I really badly miss the comfort of my own home. I have my earphones with some music on to try and distract me from getting too anxious (everyone is asleep). My head is killing me and i'm exhausted but I cannot sleep at all in such a unfamiliar environment. At times I wanna cry because I hate it. Thank fuck i'm decent in hiding my emotions so no one knows.

I feel like whenever I think about killing myself I think about when I was a little kid and how much I had loved my family and they loved me back, and all the great times we had, which makes me tear up and not want to do it, in fact Im kinda getting teary eyed now. But then another part of my brain says how they could just deal with their problems, and If I die it does not effect me at all. Then it just keeps going back and forth and I just go crazy.

After calling in reinforcements (his dad) to spend the evening with him, I took the kids to a friends house to try and decompress.  Couple hours later, friends neighbor comes over and says my 12-yr old punched his kid in the face.  I know my don is dealing with emotional issues, so after making sure everyone is ok , we go home...where my husband is and has calmed down from earlier... so I make the mistake of telling him what happened (with the neighbor boy).

47,"I feel chronically depressed. The last year of my life I spiraled so badly in my sex and steroid addiction which was very much fueled by social media and the sexual validation I received on there. I have struggled with sex addiction my whole life, since my babysitter molested me at six years old which then began my porn addiction. When I had an audience to admire me, my ego exploded. I lost track of who I was. I lost track of where I had been, what I had done, and with whom. 

I hurt the only person who ever cared about me so deeply, my girlfriend. I put my health (and hers) severely at risk. I took three times the normal dose of a steroid (Trenbolone) manufactured to thicken livestock which resulted in me needing a permanent prescription for blood pressure medication. My breathing is labored now, I am only 22. I just wanted to look good. I just wanted to feel worthy enough to be in a room with other people without staring at the floor with my head hanging low. I wanted to feel like, ok, at least my body is really nice, and that makes me kind of special. It wasn’t even about superiority, it was just about having this very materialistic surface buffer that would not make me feel so pathetic and wimpy, something to distract myself from all the ways in which I hate myself. This is where my obsession with bodybuilding comes from. It is an all encompassing lifestyle which takes so much energy and thought, it’s like playing a video game. (Huge surprise, I used to be addicted to World of Warcraft).

In the last two months, I have made significant progress with my sex addiction, I have abstained completely from steroids, I am working with two therapists, but yet, here I am, now, broken, empty, a shell of a man. 

**I was recently diagnosed with BPD and as uncomfortable as it was to hear that, it was reassuring to know that I am not alone. I am posting here hoping I can feel less alone. I have been struggling.**

I have not retained a single friend my whole life other than my significant other. I have always wondered: is it me, or are people just crappy? Maybe both. A lot of people I think could sense my vulnerability, my inherent need to connect with others. When I started getting popular online people would gravitate towards me. I would always give so much of myself away, people would take and take, only to later evaporate from my life. I always go back to zero. Everybody leaves. From one month to the next they are a beacon of light to someone I don’t want to think about. When I deleted my social media, all of a sudden no one wanted to hang with me anymore. 

Through quarantine I was messing around with psychedelics a lot which at first helped me put many of my lost memories from my year-spiral back together, but what I discovered was deeply disturbing. So disturbing in fact, that, while tripping, I was convinced that I should be committed, or executed, or both. *So as not to let the readers imagination go wild, the memories were of infidelity, and of interaction in which I showed complete apathy towards my partner.* I attempted suicide while sober, after that, and while I am no longer considering actually doing that ever again, I can’t help but fantasize about *not* having to exist with the feelings I have that I cannot shake off.

Since then I have attempted to to pick up the broken pieces of my life since gaining that deeper understanding of who I am: who I was, where I’ve been, what I’ve done. 

I have continued to attempt to connect with others, but again, people continue to disappoint. Part of me wants to give up, but the humanity in me wants to believe that there are people out there who can be exactly the friends I need. I just haven’t found them yet. I opened a social media account to connect with people recently and was originally really excited, but it is just so exhausting making an effort with people, it makes me want to just accept my solitude. I feel trapped in a limbo. I’m going to force myself to try anyway.

My mind feels like it is deteriorating, like my condition is only getting worse. I can’t help but wonder if all those hormones I took are to blame. Or maybe I was genetically predisposed to be sick, and the psychedelics and hormones just brought it out, I don’t know.

Since being diagnosed with BPD and after an increased use in recreational Ketamine I have experienced more intense mood swings and depressive episodes. I often feel disoriented. A bus I have taken 20, 30 times, I am staying on too long because I miss my stop. Then I get off that seems like it’s near my house but is actually 10 minutes away??? It makes me feel insane. “Not wanting to be here” is more often on my mind these days than not. I feel amazing and then one thing, a comment, a thought will torpedo my whole day.

I feel like a scourge on the earth. So much is wrong with me and my mind is sick. At least when I had steroids and porn I could distract myself for hours, I could get wrapped up in myself or in the videos and just forget about reality. My life will only continue to be difficult on myself and others around me, it brings me to the conclusion that it would be better if I disappeared. The only reason I am still here **(and will stay)** is because I have done enough damage to my girlfriend. To screw her over by breaking her heart again would destroy her, and I am unwilling to do that.",25Oct2020,1

49,"Lets start at the beginning. I became depressed at about the age of 8 and never told anyone about it because I was afraid it would make my parents think they had failed. From 9 to 10 on Christmas I would cry myself to sleep every night. Sporadically I’ve contemplated suicide, and even held the knife to my throat. Every year on some sports team my parents made me play there were popular kids who tormented my mentally and made me want to quit, kill them, or kill myself. A couple years ago I decided I wasn’t afraid of death, that I welcomed it, but I wanted to go down fighting. Since then I’ve always carried a sharpened pocket knife on me. In elementary school I was diagnosed with ADHD, which is why this is so badly written. For years I’ve had a terrible addiction that I’d rather not speak of but has made me hate myself even more. In middle school I actually managed to get a girlfriend, but I ruined that relationship after 7 months because I was a coward. In highschool I was on the soccer team (this year) since no one got cut and was, again, tormented by the popular good kids. At this point I couldn’t give a shit about the present and only looked forwards to the future, and my goal of becoming an FBI agent. I fantasied of murdering those boys bye penetrating their abdomens with the sharp corner flag stacks and standing over them while they bleed out. Around here my anger issue first appeared. This started soiling my relationships and I dove deeper into self isolation. I now dream of murder and death, mostly myself doing it to those I believe “wronged” me. I wish for the chance to fight someone, first or knife, bar thug or mugger. I’ve never had much emotion except negative and I have a terrible time connecting to others. I’ve been to several funerals, never cried at them. I was slightly jealous of my brother when he saw a man who got hit by a car when committing suicide (the man). I’m only 15.

Then I was raped 3 years ago. And I think that kind of peaked my depression. I've gotten much better since then, I've healed mostly, mentally. I get bouts of anxiety where I tremble/shake and cry, triggered by a feeling that I'm too weak or too inferior to protect myself I think. I get panic attacks once in a while, which is new. 

I hate, hate, hate, being physically alone. It's the single thing I've never been able to fix, just suppress. Yet I've pushed almost all the people I used to be close to away. 

Now I have such a hard time getting close to people. I am always cynical. I don't care for fronts with strangers. I don't care for really picking up conversation. I don't relate to anyone anymore. I really don't know who I am anymore. I have always echoed people and I'm in a mental limbo. 

I am afraid to trust people. I'm afraid to initiate things by myself so I become stagnant. I have such low self esteem/self value, and I don't know what to do about it. 

It's like, I feel better when I'm around the people I'm closest to, and then I'm alone these thoughts just creep back, so I do nothing. I always have nightmares of accidentally hurting people. Or that I'll lose control of myself. I rely on others to feel confident in order to do things, so when I'm alone I'm just afraid.

Anyway yesterday she started screaming at me just because I couldn't remember Despacito's notes on my alto sax when I played if for the first time and she apparently thinks that I should be aBleE tOkNoW tHe NotES oN mY fIrSt Try and remember them. This led to an arguement and I just shut myself in my room and I've been thinking whether I should just cut off from her once I turn 18 and go to university. I've also been having suicidal tendencies lately but I've been able to supress them but since my mom stopped allowing me to even relax wanting me to exercise 4 Hours a day and my body is not ready for that and I do try exercise but she constantly screams at me for not being able to hold out during her excercises where she just sits on the sofa and screams at me. I've been grounded from playing video games which is one of the ways I release stress and now I can't even talk to my friends with the entire MCO going on and I have a constant headache but I don't try to rely on Tylenol.  The only stress release I have right now is reading e-books on my Iphone 6S that I salvaged after my mom broke it and as far as she is concerned I use my Nokia. I'm not sure but before I go to bed I have started to hallucinate and I just start seeing shadows jump on the wall.  The only reason I haven't ran out of my house is because my dad still genuinely cares about me and brings my mom away so I can be at home alone sometimes. My mother beats me sometimes when I'm not able to do a task properly but I've become numb to this and my pain reception is a bit slow which I don't know is either a product of the beatings or stress. At this point I really don't know what to do but all I have to do is survive another year and once I'm in university I'll probably start working and try to get myself a physciatrist or something and finally have my freedom.,25Oct2020,1
62,"For a while I was ignoring everything I should be doing and feeling terrible about it. Now I ignore everything I should be doing and feel nothing. It's the same way with everything, really. Even hobbies I used to enjoy. I don't have strong feelings towards anything anymore one way or another. No happiness, excitement, fear, regret or any other similar feelings. Sometimes I'll feel something briefly, but it doesn't last more than a few minutes and then I'm right back to the grey nothingness.

64,"When I was a kid, I had a teddy bear... and I was a very upset kid, a very angry kid, I used to take out my anger on the teddy bear. I would call him ugly and misshapen and say that I hated him and wished he would die and all these horrible things while I hit him and pulled at his limbs and threw him around the room. One day I put him in a closet and told him that nobody loved him so nobody would come to get him so he would be alone forever. 
Now that I am a teenager, I cry thinking about this. That poor teddy bear, I just want to hug him and apologize and let him know that he isnt ugly and that hes lovd because he proabbly feels so bad... but whenever I look for him I cant find him anywhere. 
This is obviously really stupid because teddy bears dont have feelings but I dunno thinking about what I did... it makes me very distressed thinking about how I mistreated that bear. I want to make things right. However the bear is gone and like, this is really fcking weird. Inanimate. Objects. Have. No. Feelings. And yet I'm crying over the fact that I may have hurt an inanimate objects feelings and it makes me feel So fcking sad. I proabbly made him feel how I felt...
Is it normal to be so sad over a stupid teddy bear? Is it normal to feel so guilty over mistreating AN OBJECT? Is something wrong with me? Is it normal to consider teddy bears as having feelings?",25Oct2020,1
65,"I wanted to wait longer to post this, and I hope it isn't removed over legalities like 1970s Marijuana paranoia, but I have been microdosing mushrooms over the past few weekends and it is a legitimate wonder drug for me. 

Some background - I have suffered from depression, anxiety, OCD, my entire life. I'm 33 now and I had all but given up on anything actually curing any of these conditions. I refused to be zombified by typical pharmaceutical ""cures"" as I took zoloft when I was younger and I loathed it. I saw myself as worthless, I thought no one liked me, and I would double check, triple check, quadruple check things like doors being locked when I was having a particularly crippling moment of self consciousness. To best explain it I thought I was SO stupid that I couldn't believe I would do something right mindlessly so surely it had to be check again and again. I am not nearly as bad as I was when I was a teenager or early 20s but to say it's gone is a lie. Its even manifested into physical ailments. All of my anxiety is now in my upper left back/neck. Weird I know but trust me that's where it is. Sometimes I can get a good crack (don't do this) and it'll be alleviated briefly but always comes back. 

Anyway now I'm ranting, I have been slowly easing myself into psychedelics, mushrooms specifically, and wow 👏 the results are insane. Literally ALL negatives wash away, I physically and mentally feel like superman, and the results last well after the effects wear off. I feel confident, I just ""flow"" like I should. These babies have given me my full life back. If your story is anything like mine, do everything you can to promote funding and research of this, because we all know mental health is disturbingly all to ignored. 

I laugh, I let go, and I can now be my true confident self.",25Oct2020,1

67,"Hi people of the internet, wow never thought I'd vent to people on reddit. Well I'll tell you guys a little about myself, I'm a private person who keeps his feelings to himself, even from his family, because they wouldn't understand. I had a decent childhood, though everything started to turn sour when I turned 15 and up, my grandfather had a stroke when my parents opened a mechanic shop. This was around 2016

Around that time I had just transferred from middle school to online learning because of bullies, I was in 6th grade at the time and it lasted until the end of 8th grade. That was a lonely couple years, when I started highschool was when family issues started to get worse, my family had to move in with my grandfather to take care of him. My father and grandfather didn't get along well, my grandfather was harsh on my father as a kid so not a good sign right? Well we took care of him, but my father was hardly around when we needed him...my grandfather begged and cried for someone to keep him company, my sister was off to college and my parents were busy at work so I was alone with him, it wasn't my job to take care of him so i neglected him, I regret doing that but the things he's done to his wife and kid you'd understand why I didn't see him.

He was also hard of hearing so my dad gets easily irritated and starts yelling at him, the strokes made my grandfather forgetful, due to this he had to be constantly be told he couldn't walk and couldn't do anything on his own, my father yelled this to him when this happened. Now let's focus on the mechanic shop, it was just as bad as home parents yelling at each other because of stress and exhaustion, my sister's weren't around when this happened because they were always with their kids or hanging put with friends.

Me? I was a loner with not much friends, if I had to described it I was the disposable one in the group, I'm also very quiet and don't have much of a ""presence"" so not alot of people remember or notice me, so I was always around to hear the yelling and screaming, my parents always apologized about me having to hear it but it happened so often I got used to it, in the stress of all this I had to be ""the good child"" in Hope's of lessening my parents stress, but doing this caused me to burie my feelings and made me emotionally numb.

Remember me saying my father wasn't around a whole lot? Well work and he was seeing another woman, my mother always vented to me about this, never to my sister's, only me. Because of this I knew more about the situation then my sisters, they knew it alittle but didn't like talking about it, I never told them what my mother said to me, not a word.

This went on for a few years, tempers flared, listening to it all, and having to be the listener to my mother. I had to bare with the struggles of it all and always told myself it could've been worse, I knew my feelings were valid but what could I have said? ""I can't lessen to this anymore and it's all your fault"" no, it would've made it worse so i never told them how i felt about this.

Now how I felt about this is fucked up, so please don't judge me too much. I felt emptiness, emotionally numb, and a urge to kill that whore my father has been cheating with, I wanted to slaughter those whom wronged me and made me and my mother suffer. 

Ever since the affair it fucked me up, not knowing what love was, blood lust, and being more isolated than I already am, I've been dragged through the mud  multiple times that I've lost count. I still hear the yelling and crying in my head to this day. 

Now were in the present, the garage has been shut down due to my father not running it, we still work at our garage at home it's pretty roomy in our backyard so we still have customers because ironically my father is the only honest and best mechanic in town.

I'm in my junior year of highschool and my urge to kill hasn't faded away, I've never acted on those feelings and try to resist the urge to, I've fantasized about killing ever since that whore came into the picture, bottling up your emotions isn't a good thing but its difficult to explain my mind when even I don't understand what goes on inside my head.

Well that's sums it up, just wanted to vent and see what people say will they call me a monster or look at me with pity, I wonder. Hopefully these thoughts and feelings goes away. I thank you all whom listen to my story",25Oct2020,1
68,"I was bullied my whole childhood, I also moved schools a lot too so I didn't keep many friends. Long story short, I now feel like there is something wrong with me and I am undesirable. I am in college now and I can never tell if someone likes me or if I like someone (romantically). Anyone who shows kindness the slightest bit over common courtesy I feel like I am in love with them but I dont know if this is real. When my friends tell me someone is into me I feel like they just want something from me or they are just being nice and are nice to everyone.

69,"Hopefully someone here can tell me why I do this. So whenever someone has news or whatever whether it be good or bad, I can never express my emotions. For example, my friend might tell me something really exciting and then have to say “are you not excited?” Then I’d have to follow up and explain that I am. Or if someone tells me how shitty their day was or a problem they have, my brain says oh they want advice. So then my rational brain turns on and tells them what they should do but then I get an answer like “it’s not that simple, why can’t you just empathize?” or “why don’t you care?” It’s not that I don’t care or anything it’s just that even when something affects me I just sit with it. I haven’t been able to cry in I don’t know how long. My emotions are just non-existent. I can’t remember a time when I was really happy or sad, just kind of numb. I also get told a lot that I need to stop detaching from my emotions but I’m not trying to. I’m genuinely trying to feel something. I’m not on any psychiatric meds if you’re wondering because some people would think that sounds like an anti-depressant or something. I’m just completely numb. Whenever I try to cry or even laugh lately I can’t. Someone please tell me I’m not a complete psychopath.",25Oct2020,1
70,"M17, U.S. I've never been one to talk about my feelings, but my family (mainly my mom) is saying I don't talk about my feelings enough. I tried therapy once, and people say it's hit or miss. I think ""miss"" would be an understatement. I don't like talking to people, and to be honest I don't like people. I've been told by teachers, peers, etc. that I'm very charismatic and intelligent but have trouble ""following social cues."" I'm also asexual but I don't think that's relevant.

For most of my life I've felt as if my emotions are ""dampened."" The only emotion that I've been able to reliably feel is anger. I'm making this post because I've been going through difficult circumstances recently. I've never been good with staying employed, being on my third job in two years. The first job was in fast food; I worked there for about three months and quit because it was too boring standing around talking to people for eight hours. My second job lasted a week. I got hired at a grocery store chain and failed the pre-employment drug test (amphetamine.) I recently got a job working in  landscaping. I think I'll enjoy this one more because it's not as boring.

71,"Its honestly, a sign that things need to change. That we live in a country, that the people who are having the worst days of there lives need to pay even more just to survive. That if my friend wanted to survive there cost of there existence was $10K. 

This makes me think, we act like we want to help suicide victims or people who attempt suicide, yet in reality we punish them for committing it. Like them being sick with mental illness is there fault and they should be punished with a bill. When people want to leave mental hospitals not because they are fully rehabilitated but because they are scared of the bill they will get in the mail. 

Mental health is not someones fault, no one should be punished because they committed suicide, they should be helped, given care, love, and financial support if they need it not the other way around. 

Private insurance is a complete scam, if they don't cover suicide attempts then that is a scam in my eyes. HEALTH INSURANCE SHOULD COVER EVERYTHING THAT IS REQUIRED TO LIVE!! IT DOESNT MATTER IF YOU DID IT TO YOURSELF IF YOU NEED IT TO SURVIVE YOU DESERVE IT!!!!!

Its sad to see politicians protect such a crime which is the health industry, people who work in the health insurance industry should be punished for causing harm to millions of people.

72,"For the past 3 months, I’ve felt like I’m slowly losing my mind. It started with me feeling constantly anxious and repeating thoughts and actions over and over. It has progressed to the point where I feel like I’ve lost my sanity, and I feel like I’ve become a completely different person. I’m in college and live at home, and my college offers free therapy, but due to Covid it’s only online. I’ve put off therapy because I don’t have a lot of privacy at home, and I don’t want to discuss all of my issues in front of everybody. I’ve almost tried to make an appointment at a place that does offer in person therapy in the past, but I can’t afford it on my own, and I was afraid of telling my mom. Today I made the decision to tell my mom about my issue because I can’t take it anymore, and she suggested that I try the free online therapy through my college first. But besides the privacy issue is that I have to wait until Monday to schedule an appointment, and even then I’ll probably have to wait at least 2 weeks until my appointment actually happens. I feel like every minute that I can’t get help I lose more of my sanity, and having no choice but to wait 2 weeks for help makes me feel incredibly hopeless.

Sometimes i feel better then others like when i accept that this is just life. 

Im sad but i never cry and cant even when i try to let it out in hopes of feeling better. Alot of times i wish about having a significant other but can never get one becausr my loneliness makes me desperate.

I dont want to kill myself or think i will because of my religion. But i think i will live a very infill filling life spent alone eating tv dinners and sleeping alone over and over again.

76,"I need help diagnosing myself. I don’t know where to begin. My therapist has never even attempted at diagnosing me or anything. 

Let me get this straight. I’ve been playing violin for 10 years. I’m 14 years old, and I don’t know what’s wrong with me. My mother is currently always upset right now and I don’t know why. When I was younger, she would yell at me when she would sit in on my practice sessions. She would tell me I wasn’t trying and tell me my playing sounded terrible. I still love her, don’t get me wrong, but for a six year old, this was awful. I was always trying my hardest even if I didn’t always fix my teachers corrections on the first try. 

When I was ten, I booked a role on broadway. Sometimes when I would come out of performances she would see me in, she would get very mad at me and tell me all of the things I did wrong and sometimes yell at me in front of my friends. Sometimes she would stay mad at me for a week after a “bad” performance. 

When I was twelve, I booked a role on broadway! On the first day of rehearsal however, I noticed my voice was deeper and I couldn’t sing higher notes. One day during a performance, I learned I only had two shows left and was being forced to leave. My mom was upset at first, then told me it was my anxieties fault. I remember feeling so destroyed. 

When I went home I stopped eating as I thought I was fat and had delusions. I never lost major weight (as my fasting often broke) but I was 72 pounds at the time and wanted to be lower. 

This past may, I had suicidal thoughts. It sucked. I remember thinking “why is this happening to me?” I almost jumped off of a bridge several times. I’m recovered now but that was some of the most difficult shit I’ve ever had to go through. I just remember feeling so scared and alone. I didn’t know what to do or who to turn to.

Often when I would tell my mom about this, she would obviously be upset. She would tell me “your life ain’t that hard.” I know my life has been relatively easy as my family doesn’t really struggle financially, but I just don’t know whether or not my life HAS been difficult. 

Also I have major anxiety. I always think I’m dying because I get headaches all the time and mild chest pains occasionally. This anxiety is awful. I have ear pain right now and think I’m going deaf even though two doctors said I probably wasn’t and that my hearing was perfect after two hearing tests.

Sometimes I’ll complain to my mom about these symptoms and ask whether I’m going deaf or not or if I’m dying. (My anxiety gives me these delusions) but she tells me I’m stupid sometimes, and sometimes she reassured me. It depends on the day. 

Recently my mom and dad got into an argument over whether or not she was overworking me. I was in the room the whole time. My mom left our house for almost four days. I was told my by my mom and my sister in the moment she left that it was my fault that she was leaving: now they’ve both apologized.

What is classified as emotional trauma? Did I go through emotional trauma? Depression? I need help figuring these things out, as my therapist won’t do it for me. 

Please help me. I need it: I can’t take the anxiety and the sadness and fear anymore.",25Oct2020,1
77,"I've literally had the worst few days of my life...



Let me begin by saying I've been having UTI symptoms for the last 6 months on and off. I visted the doctors first around 6 months ago with symptoms of a uti and the doctor asked me to do a urine test and everything came back negative so I left confused and feeling ill and after a few days my symptoms cleared up then 2 months later the same thing happens again Uti symptoms I go the doctors and nothing turns up on the urine test so again I leave with no medication and again after a few days it clears up and then I go to another  doctor out of my area 1 month ago for a pre-employment medical test and he picks up urine in my blood and high white blood count he asked if I had any uti symptoms and I told him I didn't now but I had symptoms previously and my doctor didn't pick anything up he tells me to follow up with my doctor which I do the next day and again as usual my doctor asks me to do a urine test and again  and nothing comes up but I tell her I'm not happy and I want more tests run so I get a pap smear done and I get tested for any stds which all come back fine! 

Monday just passed comes and I sit on the toilet and im overcome with the most intense back pain side of my life its so bad that I start to feel cold and that im going to pass out but the pain only lasts 30 or so seconds and then its completely gone..

Now this is where my mental issuez come in I've suffered from social anxiety since I was teen and while life has a big struggle at times when it comes to big social events and changes to my life I've managed somewhat though I've had bouts of depression. 

But now I'm going through something so scary and usual and im not sure if it's stress related or health related but I started a job this week working 2 nights from 2-10pm this is huge for me as I've been a stay at home mum for 7 years and while I do have a small.online graphic design business which brings in a little money every week and I volunteer with my local meals on wheels I haven't worked or been around lots of new people for a very very very long time and I feel kind of forced into this new job  as my partner is about to take a pay cut so we will need the extra money and even though my anxiety is through the roof I pushed through my first day and I  was crying and shaking nearly the whole drive there I managed to get through my first night ok but that night I couldn't sleep after I got home and this is when the paraniod thoughts started that the other workers had spiked my drink with speed. Anyways I knew I had to be up to take my daughter to school in a few hours and I need to work that afternoon again and I was so riddled with anxiety at this point that I would be so tired and even more anxious then the day before so I ended up having a shot of vodka and that put me to sleep mind you I'm not drinker and might only have a few drinks a year as alcohol makes me so much anxious but it worked and I got maybe 3 hours sleep. 

Second afternoon shift was hell I had really bad uti symptoms again and there were so many people around me and it was so busy and people were staring at me that I become so paraniod that they wanted me to leave that I decided I wanted to leave because my side was stinging so bad and I was to nervous  to keep asking to go the toilet so I went to my supervisor and asked if I could finish my shift for the night because I wasn't feeling well and she gave me a break and told me that if people were making me uncomfortable to tell her because the people I was working with have been none to be very rude to newbies, anways I took a break and ended up seeing my shift through, but by the end of the night I was in so much pain that I called my mum on my drive home and told her I needed to see another doctor because I had UTI symptoms again and she recommended I go and see her doctor in another town which I did the next day and he picked up blood in my urine and started me on antibiotics and I've been booked in for a ultrasound this coming Tuesday. Now Thursday night on the day I stared the antibiotics I was still in pain laying in bed when my 7 year old came in to say goodnight and gave me a letter from her school that say her school was teaching kids about keeping safe and protecting there bodies it was another way of saying informing kids of sexual abuse pretty much anyways I read the letter told.my daughter what I have always told her since she was very young that her body was hers and no one was ever aloud to touch her without her permission and kind of explained thats what they will be teaching her then I took my daughter back into her room and that's when I found my partner (my daughters father acting nervous in my daughters room he was standing there on his phone and had this scared look on his face like he had overhead what I had said and I was confused at first but then he layed next to my daughter and started reading her a book and he seemed really nervous and out of breath and that's when I stared to become suspicious and then he went to bed straight after putting her to bed and didn't even say goodnight to me which is odd and that's when I was overcome with all this thought that he was abusing our daughter. I hardly got any sleep as I googled everything I possibly could on sexul abuse the signs to look out for and I thought about killing him aswell! I was in a full on panic mode that the next morning I was a complete wreck I called my mum full on crying telling her something was wrong because I was in so much pain with UTI symptoms but I also thought I was losing the plot mentally she told me I needed to go see a doctor ASAP but I was in such a crazy mood that I rang my partner and told him to come home from work right away which he did and then I confronted him about my thoughts of how he acted the night before when the note was brought out and he said that he thought it was weird they were teaching her about sex at the age thats all and I told him to read it again which he did and he said he mustn't of read it properly the first time but I didn't believe him and asked him he was abusing our daughter and said no fucking way but would he actually admit to it though and then he took me to the doctor and I told the doctor how I was having weird paraniod thoughts and the doctor  recommended I see a physciatist which I rang and left a message for on Friday but they haven't gotten back to me yet. My daughter was taken to my mums for the weekend while I rested and the pain has somewhat gone but every now and then I get a sharp sting and the paraniod thoughts keep coming and going?

Wtf is going on am I losing my mind? How am I meant to go back to my new job when I'm still very sore and how am I meant to look at my partner or go.to.work and leave her with him when I'm so paraniod he's abusing our daughter? She doesn't show any signs of abuse shes very happy, full of life and very affectionate and absolutely loves her dad and prefers his company to mind as I'm more strict.

78,"The title is pretty self explanatory. 

I’ve always struggled with mental health but never had any professional help. I’m realizing as I get older I may never get my life together if I don’t take that first step. 

This past year has been rough. Moved across the country from my home and friends. I fell hard into a depression and ended up isolating myself for 6+ months. I couldn’t drive, check the mail, or basically anything. I remember one day counting how many words I actually spoke in a single day and feeling kinda pathetic when I reached 8. I zoned out for hours and lost touch with myself without realizing it. Shit was bad. 

Eventually I felt like I was on the mend (or at least working my way there) and then we packed up to move again. I’m scared the cycle will repeat itself.  

If anyone has any advice for that first therapy appointment, it would be much appreciated. Or any kind words, really. I’ve been wigging out since I completed my patient forms and worrying about how it will go. 

I hope everyone is staying safe out there and healthy during these times.  Thank you again!",25Oct2020,1

So, here it goes. Sorry for formatting issues as I am on mobile.
(Trigger warning)
I have noticed in the last few months that my mental health has declined significantly. 
These past few years of my life has been.. strange. I was in a toxic abusive friendship with a person who I idolized. I always had to watch what I said around them and I even changed things about my personality to have them like me. Man... I even started smoking so that we could bond on something. 
During this friendship I also dated a trans-guy who really destroyed my self steem, self worth and life through abuse and manipulation. Then, when I broke up with this person they proceeded to stalk me, rape me, and all together traumatize me and brainwash me into thinking they were the victim and I was the abusive one. After this I started dating my current partner who has been great. They've been really supportive and loving thus far. But strangely in these past 2 months I have grown increasingly uncomfortable with being loved and being touched. 
I love my partner and I enjoy being loved by them. But at the same time, I feel disgusted and even enraged sometimes to be loved by them. 
I don't think it helps that in the past few months I basically stopped being friends with all of my friends because when I reached out to them about feeling suicidal and lonely, (take in count I was the friend group's therapist and I always cared for them when they were struggling) they basically make jokes about it and said that they would take care of my grave.

I don't know what is wrong with me. I love my partner, and I miss cuddling with them, but anytime I kiss them or get too physically close I feel disgusted and sometimes even mad. My appetite has been significantly decreased and I've been basically starving myself everyday because I can't bear to eat without feeling like I am going to vomit. 
I don't know what to do because I can't tell my parents about this because they will make fun of me, or use it as a way to mock me or gaslight me in the future. And I can't get therapy because I'm extremely poor and I can't get a job because of personal issues I can't disclose. I really want to speak with a professional about this but without money I'm screwed.
Does anyone here know why I have been feeling this way? Any thought or explanation that comes to mind would be extremely helpful.",25Oct2020,1

To anybody reading this, I want to let you know that I am sooo fucking tired. I had a physics SL and a math a&amp;a SL summative last week. and the week before that I had three IAs and my EE due. I really thought I did well on my math test but managed to get a 26%. I tried so hard and I was confident enough that I thought I was pass. But nvm. And the physics test was another story. I have been failing all year these subjects and I don't know what to do anymore. Ive gotten so many low grades for these two subjects it hurts to see that I added two more on my burden, This post was just a way for me to express my feelings and to anyone who stopped by, I wish you success and hope you're having a great day.",25Oct2020,1
83,"Hey guys! Thanks for reading. I appreciate your support. 

I've been completed isolated due to Covid. I just moved to California for college, and I've built zero connections. I'm struggling to figure out how. I call my mom once a week, and thank the people in the dining hall for my food, but that's the entire extent of my social interaction. I've started mal obsessive daydreaming. Sometimes it'll go on for hours, where I'll just be living out this fake life in my head. I'll act it out too, and mouth the words I'm saying, and change my expressions. I can't help but feel like I'm going crazy. My depression on top of it makes it hard for me to get anything accomplished at all. 

I know that's a lot, and I know I need to make connections. If you guys have any tips for making friends in a new state with the pandemic, I would really appreciate it. If nothing else, some kind words would also be very appreciated. Thank you for your time. I love you all",25Oct2020,1

85,"I live with anxiety, PTSD, schizophrenia, and major depression, so my life has been the physical embodiment of ""shit's on fire yo"". I don't laugh unless in the company of other people, and only if they are currently laughing about something. That is until yesterday. I was lying in bed and trying to sleep after a day of work (working is very hard because of my mental illnesses, but I don't have the money to survive the fight for disability benefits so I have to force myself until I eventually shut down), when I started laughing. I wasn't laughing at anything in particular, just laughing. It would move from manic giggling to hysteric roaring and back to a quiet chuckle. I laughed for about an hour, then coughed a lot and fell asleep to my normal surrealist nightmares. I woke up with spots of blood on my pillows and dried blood around my mouth, my throat aching so hard I could barely drink water without violent coughing fits. It's gotten better, so that's good. 

I have no idea what caused the outburst, such a thing has never happened before. I'm scared that I'll start doing it at work (I work solo shifts as a security guard for a mall, I don't think the people there would be comfortable with a security guard laughing like a lunatic while on duty). Has this kind of thing happened to anyone else before? How did you deal with it?",25Oct2020,1

89,"My family and I have never been very close. They did some stuff like making loud noises, to annoy me if I had a headache/migraine, because it makes the pain much worse, bugging me with my phobia till I got panic attacs, forbidding me to go to a doctor (with a broken hand. I am a musician, so that was not funny) and to a psychologist (I have been very depressed lately, wanted to kill myself multiple times and have a very bad phobia). On top of that, they never showed a sign, they actually liked me, we don't talk and they completly don't care if I accomplish anything (It is not even about not noticing little things like good grades. I got a place at a university at 15 and would study physics now while going to school, if there wasn't a pandemic). I would probably not have a problem with that because I get, that I don't deserve regocnition for everything, because I am doing nothing great anyway, but they do only treat me that way. My siblings are getting praised for every good grade and every thing they do.

Last week, my dad wanted to drive me to boarding school and my sister wanted to accompany him and I got very upset, because I don't want any more of my family at school (my home) than necassary. I told her so and of course, I know that hurt her feelings, but I just couldn't stand having her there for even five minutes. The school is my only safe place and I just can't let her go there and destroy that for me. The whole fight ended with my dad dumping me at the train station with no money and expected me to get to school by myself (3-4 hours train ride, 30€ for a ticket) then my mom called me to scream at me for making drama and being ungrateful etc., to whitch I said some very rude/bad things, like that she didn't care for me or that she should leave me alone. She just continued to insult me.

Now, I am back home for holidays and my family has been acting as if nothing had happend, but my mom made an appointment to make a test if have Aspergers (I googled the symptoms and did a bit of research and it does not fit me at all, as in I do not even have one of the symptoms) and finally agreed to talk to the neurologist, that wanted to diagnose me like one year ago, again. I never got a diagnosis, because my mom didn't bother to make an appointment to talk about the results of the tests he did. I feel very guily about the whole thing, because technically it was my fault, that we have been fighting and I shouldn't have been so bitchy and mean and should have let my sister do what she wants. I just don't know what to do now. I really don't want to stay home any longer and I know I should apologize, but I just can't get myself to do it, because it will just start the whole thing again.",25Oct2020,1
90,"I haven't posted on reddit much... Maybe as a teenager but here goes.

Today I'm one month and 26 days or so sober from alcohol abuse. And that's awesome I guess. But the past few days I've had a depression like I've never had before. I haven't been sober before that for like 8-9 years

The really disheartening thing to me is I'm doing better right? Well it doesn't feel like it. I get pains in my arms and legs alot (aches) And now I'm getting heart palpitations again pretty frequently so that's pretty scary in itself. But today the depression is real. I'm not suicidal but could care less about life. What did I achieve becoming sober? Miserable pain and depression. I don't want to do anything. I wake up late on purpose because it's closer to the time I can go back to sleep.

I can't even drink a cup of coffee without getting all of these pains thrown at me

I don't really ever remember being depressed before I got sober and it is terrible

When I hear people laugh or see them smile it makes me so angry and I don't know why. I hate this. I absolutely hate it.

What did I achieve? Lack of a good time and severe depression and pain.

I know it sounds wierd but for the past few nights ive sat in the bathtub with the shower on. I just don't care anymore.

Somedays ill wake up in a pretty good mood and not 10 minutes later a random pain will shoot and that sets my mind back into a deep depression

Did I really do all of this. This thing that people say is a great accomplishment just for my body to just hurt and give up?  I'm not asking for medical advice...

I've tried smoking weed and it just makes me feel like shit (I have extreme anxiety).

Before I got sober I went to the doctor for anxiety issues and they prescribed me prozac or something. But I hate pills they scare me. So I never started taking them.

The major reason I stopped drinking was because about 2 months ago I felt like SHIT like I hate going to the doctor over anything. I try to put it off... But I couldn't. I called an ambulance and told them what was wrong. Told them my drinking habits and lack of eating habits. They hooked me up to an IV and came back like 40 mins later in the hospital. Doctor said ""you gotta stop drinking"" I think ok not a big deal... It will suck but no problem. And the nurse left after the doctor and said ""or at least slow down"". I dont think anything of it. Then the nurse comes back and hands me the papers showing what was wrong and what they were treating me for again I didn't think much. A friend was waiting to pick me up from the er. He asked what was wrong and I mumbled ""I think I was dehydrated"" he told me to read the paper. So I did.    They were treating me for alcoholic liver disease. I slumped into my hands and started bawling. That was the moment i felt welp it was a good run....

I called my family doctor and told him the situation and told him I needed to stop... Like now.   He prescribed me alcohol withdrawl meds and I stopped drinking the next day. And now the past week I guess is when all the pain started and with that the depression.

I've never felt this depressed. Didn't know it could humanly get this bad but apparently it can

I'm sorry for the big alcohol tangent. This was more for me to just type it. To get it out. I don't really talk to anyone about my feelings and that's why I'm here.

I'm really sorry for punctuation and spelling and spacing.

The only thought I can really think is... This was all for nothing.

TLDR - had to stop drinking due to a liver disease got sober and now get pains everyday and severe depression and it all feels like it was pointless",25Oct2020,1

92,"       I (20M)deeply care about everyone in my life and I’m honestly a very emotional person but I have a hard time conveying my deeper feelings. I often push people away when they express any affection towards me because it just makes me nervous and uncomfortable. This makes it really hard to have any romantic relationships and I think people really believe I don’t care about them sometimes.

      For some perspective, my dad walked out when I was young and then killed himself when I was 14, It really fucking hurt. I felt a lot of regret about the way things turned out and boxed myself out from any new relationships for a long time believing I could spare myself some inevitable heartbreak in the future. The few times I broke this oath and put my self out there I was met with rejection and fake friends. I blamed this failure on myself and turned to self harm. Fro amplify things, my mom got cancer during my senior year and that pushed me further into my hole. She beat it and is doing great now getting back to as normal as she can be. Even with the few good friends I had I felt completely alone on this planet. I’ve always felt very self conscious around everyone and I haven’t outgrew that. 

     Fast forward to today I honestly haven’t made any progress. I’m now 20 years old and still possess the same social ineptness. There has been many girls I have wanted to take a step further with but i can never seem to let my self
Go. I can’t even do things like hug my family members unless they initiate. My anxiety and depression have been fucking crushing me but I feel physically unable to reach out to anyone. I feels like I am all alone here, and it’s my fault. I really need some advice on how I can improve my emotional expression. I’m typing this at 3 A.M. so sorry if this sounds like incoherent babbling.",25Oct2020,1
93,"Like I said this is probably a really common question but I’m in a more unique situation and could use some advice. I (m17) have some symptoms of various mental disorders (obviously undiagnosed). I don’t know what’s wrong with me but I definitely have symptoms that fit into anxiety, depression, adhd, etc just don’t know what specifically. 

Lately though I’ve started to get worse. I can barely get out of bed, haven’t done school work in 4 days (where usually I do stuff every day), have started to feel really tense and get really cold to the point where I can’t do anything but lay there and scroll through social media. I used to go down to the beach every day and now my “anxiety” (or whatever it is) has gotten so bad to where I can barely go out to get my mail. All in all I’ve just started to go downhill and I’m really worried, lost, alone, and know I need help. 

Thing is, my moms a psychiatrist (the only child/adolescent psychiatrist in a good 100 miles around me but that’s besides the point). She’s stated before how I probably have social anxiety and depression and has asked if I need medication and I always say no and change the conversation. But she also won’t admit or at least see my problems and therefore I have no way of getting help and getting diagnosed. I feel so weird going to her and explaining that I need help since she knows far better and more than me. So how do I approach her and say I need help? Especially with her position? She’s mentioned mental health (like I said) a couple times but doesn’t think whatever is wrong with me is serious enough to warrant anything being done. I think it’s part of her not wanting to admit that her own child has mental health problems that she’s supposed to fix. 

I just don’t know what to do at this point. Back in sophomore year I switched to completely online school and I got progressively worse until I planned to kill myself if I had to do another year of it and I feel myself going down that same path only worse. How can I get help before it gets too late?",25Oct2020,1
94,"I'm not sure how to get this across effectively but I'm going to try my best.

For some background, I am diagnosed with many health issues, Bipolar II, anxiety, and PTSD. When i was informed by my grandmother that my mom was diagnosed with cancer (stage 3, I was raised by my maternal grandparents) I had no reaction or feeling on it. I knew it was horrible, but it almost felt like I was watching my life as if it wasnt my own?

I later had a cry about it (about a month after) but that was all that happened.

I have been told about family or friends of family passing, and had little to no reaction. However if the slightest thing happens to my grandparents or partner I get extremely upset.

So, there's this girl that Ive been madly in love with for two years. At first we both followed each other on social media. Then, suddenly she unfollowed me for no reason.

So this morning I was looking at my close friend's profile (the quiet kid) and my crush followed him. I was became so insecure. 

I was so jealous of him. I kept thinking maybe I'm never gonna be enough for her. Maybe, it was because he's better looking. Maybe, it was because he's more attractive. Meanwhile, my brain keeps putting me down by saying stuff like ""Your ugly, you'll never get her"".

I’ve had my hardships in life just like anyone else however they’ve all left their own unique scars that never seemed to heal right. For a long time I called what I had depression however I’ve never sought for professional help. I have good days where I’m confident, funny, outgoing etc... however when I’m alone at night with my thoughts like I am right now I question everything. I’m harder on myself more than any “bully” could aspire to be and second guess every good thing in my life. The more I get lost in these thoughts the more I contemplate suicide and how all of this pain could stop. They’re just thoughts however I have had a time where suicide as an option was just a inch away. I feel alone and crave a partner for love and emotional support. I hate this feeling because I know most people would kill to have a big family that loves them, a home, clothes, food, entertainment, education  etc. on top of everything I feel like a fraud to the new friends I made. I come off as dominant and outgoing however I feel so damaged and vulnerable inside. I’m at a point where even the slightest hardships bring a tingling pain in my heart and left arm, next are  the thoughts, and finally I have to take deep breaths for maybe an hour or so to keep calm because if I don’t I completely breakdown.

I am afraid of losing him but I know that my actions pushes him away from me. I don't like feeling abandoned or actually getting abandoned because it causes me so much pain that I take it out on other people. The anger that people have caused me built up inside me.

For the sake of a better understanding and avoiding repeating combinations of words such as ""my girlfriend's mother"" or ""my girlfriend's grandmother"", I'll called them my ""mother-in-law"" and ""grandmother-in-law"" respectively, of course, and even though we're not married, but fuck it, I even got myself confused while reading this.

Two nights ago my girlfriend told me she wanted to run away from her home, go to a different town for some time, a month or so, I'd come along, of course. I immediately knew it was a one day thing, for as much as she's been depressed and desperate and for as many problems she has with her mother she wouldn't do such thing. I'll admit it, I even got excited by the idea, we have practically had an online relationship for half a year, and anyway, I didn't want to bring her down to earth too abruptly as I can totally understand why'd she have such thoughts. Bear with me, please.

This may or may not sound crazy to you, but she hasn't come out, not a single time since the quarantine started in our country back in march, even if it ended almost two months ago. It isn't her but her mother who I want to make the focus of this post about. There are some reasons for this, the first being her parents who are of course rather old and thus at-risk population, others being that she has an obsession with the whole virus thing, she's paranoid, thinks the thing is everywhere, it's all she talks about according to my girlfriend, also fear, naturally, and sort of playing hard to get.

Now, it's safe to assume that having been almost seven months and a half locked has made a negative effect on her, as well as her parents and children, including my girlfriend, but again, as she's playing hard to get she is unable to recognize it to herself and thinks it's all a thing her daughter makes up to play the victim. Just about three weeks ago my girlfriend had an emotional crisis, this did not settle well with her mother who, to make matters more intense believes depression and anxiety are not real but rather cause of the lack of God in one's life, this led her to make some seriously unpleasant comments, making fun of her own daughter and even being verbally aggressive, yelling at her, failing to have some empathy, etc. Probably the worst thing she said was insinuating that my girlfriend had not yet hung herself because she had nowhere to do it. Imagine being angry at someone because they're in a bad mental state for not being able to go out in half a year, unbelievable, and my girlfriend is not even an atheist, she does believe in God, she's just critical enough to reject living as a catholic, I think you get my point, her mother won't. Fortunately she's doing better now as she's having online therapy, a thing she has insisted in doing for several years, with no response from her mother until now, and this leads me to my next point. This woman has some serious unresolved business with therapists as she absolutely despised the idea of her daughter seeing one and though she paid, reluctantly, still gets furious whenever the subject is mentioned, has this passive-agressive behaviour, stops talking to her for several days even, for no reason whatsoever and only does so if she needs to ask for a favour. The therapist knowing of my MIL's refusal to realize how feeling bad can be a perfectly normal thing, asks my girlfriend to speak to her and try to open her mind, the answer was ""don't get me involved in your problems"". God, imagine being this selfish, her own sister was diagnosed with severe depression due to a brain disorder a few years ago, and she's very religious, how can she say that? Finally, my girlfriend missed her psychologist appointment this week since her mother would not talk to her and therefore there was no chance she'd pay for the session.

I don't believe this attitude towards going to therapy has always been the same, at the beginning of the century she divorced my girlfriend's father, an abusive alcoholic who happens to be a lawyer and has therefore exercised every trick in his power to pay as little as possible for the support of his children. She took herself and her kids, two and very little at the time, my girlfriend included, to see a psychologist, so did with her mother years later and just a few months back said that once they could go out she'd take her son who at the time had some sort of crisis. He's always been quiet and very introvert, but during a week or so became extremely rude, wouldn't talk or even look at anyone, when my girlfriend and MIL tried to speak to him there was no answer, he completely ignored them and got very controlling with who used the wifi which he doesn't pay so he could play online games with his friends. This woman instead of getting mad at this attitude, got very sad, understandable yet upsetting as she won't show this sort of compassion or attention to her daughter. It's obvious she has a preference for him, could be because he's male, I don't know. She taught him how to drive and not and not my girlfriend despite insisting, every time they went out with their uni mates he'd be the one to administrate the money she gave them, usually spending all of it by himself, she doesn't demand the same academic performance from him at uni as she does from my girlfriend, and even when she bore her soul to it, to the point of studying two careers at the same time, what she gets is occasional teasing because one of this careers is not economically profitable. You can't tell me this is normal, and she didn't even have brothers, only sisters.

At the beginning of the year my girlfriend and I went drinking for the first time, it was with her uni mates. My MIL is not someone who gives permission to go out so easily, and if she does, she is not particularly flexible about the time of arrival back home (with my girlfriend, of course and now is worth mentioning she's 21). That night was an exception, one that we kinda wasted cause we got pissed very quickly, so she had to leave early. The state she was in enraged her mother. She hit her for the second time in her life, the first had been weeks prior. Now, around this time, her son had an unrecognised (by everyone, really) problem with alcohol. This worried my MIL, not the drinking problem but rather the fact that he'd go missing for hours, again, unfair as my girlfriend barely goes out, or used to.

Maybe it is also worth mentioning how my MIL is not a very open person, quiet and discreet, reserved, could that be a reason why she doesn't like therapists, who knows. My grandmother-in-law was very strict with her and her sisters as a mother, raising them in the old fashioned way, even choosing the careers they graduated from. She does not have the best of tempers, is very reserved as well, not so capable of handling her emotions, that could explain a lot of things about my MIL, and quite a lot more we'll surely never know.

I respect this woman, she's my kinda my MIL, raised three kids on her own, takes care of her parents, has done everything a person can do in the third world to be successful and secure a good standard of living to her family, she likes me, she never liked any of the boyfriends my girlfriend had in the past but she likes me, that's a beautiful thing to feel and even wants us to get married which is great because we want too, but I'm naturally concerned. Her daughter will most likely not start working until she finishes the first career, that's like a year and a half from now, and as this isn't Europe it's not very common for people to go and live by themselves until they are much older, if they ever do. My girlfriend will, eventually, but I want whatever the time it is she stays there to be pleasant. She loves that woman more than anything for as strange as she is and is always willing to turn the other cheek every time she has to. Something else is that she has a 7 year old brother, that kid means everything to that girl and I worry that, knowing how children are sometimes, he will adopt the behaviour that adults have towards his sister, his own mother for heaven's sake, that'd just break her heart.

Now, it's true this girl needs to stop making up excuses for her mother, I asked her once if my MIL had ever been to therapy, she got very defensive stating that she did not need to lol, ok. I was just asking, I know I have no right to tell anyone to go to therapy. For several months I've tried to convince her, without pushing her, of talking to her mother, confronting her, she says it won't do anything, that she's tried it before to no effect and that would only make her angrier and blah, blah, blah so now she'd rather avoid it and every time my MIL has an unjustified upset says it's an isolated thing, it is not goddamnit. Once she told me she preferred her mother to be mad at her instead of sad, my girlfriend is a very committed person. She refuses to ask for help within her family even when there are people willing to provide such support, talk with her mother and maybe make her see reason. She tried it once, guess what happened. My girlfriend is afraid of her own mother, and with reason, I've seen that woman's eyes when she's mad, risky business.

Maybe this is just the tip of the iceberg, she's had strange behaviours since my girlfriend was little, some of them are gone, thanks god, yet I think, for as happy as I am about my loved one taking therapy, until her mother doesn't heal whatever things she has inside, she will continue to pass on to her many of her fears, anger, sadness, maybe traumas.

Now, I'm afraid I said more than I should have, but I care about both of them and I really want to know how I can help, I'm more than willing to, and also how my girlfriend can help herself and her mother. I know I'm not a therapist, but again, I want to do anything I can and with whatever tools you may provide me, At least, if you could help us understand a little bit more my MIL, that could also be a great start. And it sounds dangerous, but I would even talk to her, that shall achieve anything, really and she won't listen, why would she anyway.

I really want to help this two woman and my MIL to realize she needs her daughter more than she will ever recognise, and you know what, for her to acknowledge it, fuck it, perhaps my girlfriend should run away (except she won't, because either way this is a dangerous country).

118,"My girlfriend has always been a moody person with gray periods.   


But what I have noticed is different, it is not a mood. Whatever there was before, we could solve it together. Seeing me could make her smile, relax, laugh... But recently (3-4 weeks) things have been different. She no longer laughs or smiles. She says she feels nothing and wouldn't care if she doesn't wake up. I have made her favourite food to see if it would cheer her up, proposed having a Netflix party with our favourite light-hearted animation, I have made her small gifts that I know would make her gasp in surprise.   


And in the past days it got even worse. You see, my girlfriend is a thing of beauty. I love her from head to toe, she is the most wonderful thing both outside and inside. These days she wouldn't stop repeating how she is the most hideous person, she doesn't open the front camera or look in the mirror. Furthermore, she insist she has nothing to say, that she talks like a freak and that I would find a better girfriend than her in all ways because she isn't physically attractive,   


In the beginning I thought I was the issue, I tried to recall every single word that I had ever told her, I have always shown that she is the best to have happened to me, and she has said the same. I have never cheated nor showed any interest in other women.   


She continues to share a lot of her inner struggles with me but with a lifeless tone. BEfore, whenever she shared something with me, it would be so emotional, she would seek my hug and comfort. After she calms she would say that she can't live without me. Righ now I am not even a factor in her life. She never does the things she loves anymore. Not even draw, watch shows, play with her brother. Just sit in her room and study. She isn't excited to see me, talk to me or with anybody for that matter.  Going out with anybody is a chore for her.  


She also had 2 sui\*ide attempts  


Finally, after I had thought it all out I decided that I will still be with her, support her and care about how she is, even if she doesn't feel anything about me. However, I can't help her alone. I proposed that she talks with a therapist. After that, she got angry. Insisted that this is bull and she would never talk with a stranger about anything. No matter what I said, that she will know why she feels this way, that she will see the bright in life again etc etc. I have brought it up a few times and the result was always her not wanting to talk with me anymore. 

Everynight I cry myself to sleep, I cry even while writing this. It breaks my heart to see the sunshine of the brightest star fade away. I recall every amazing moment and feel like it would never be like that again. That she would never see the bright of a sunny day....

So my parents are not compatible as a married couple and growing up they used to fight ALL THE TIME and they still do. Id say literally 1 month of the year they actually like each other’s presence and other 11 months of the year they dont talk to each other and sleep in different rooms.

Let me tell you i cannot hate it more that i was born into this family. In those 11months, when they talk its always there trying to one up each other in power and id imagine that seeing this growing up probably made me think thats normal. So i think i naturally always try to one up others and degrade them in my social life like my parents do to each other.

For all you psychologists out there, does this theory make sense? Could this be true? If not, what kinda of effects can this kind of upbringing have on a person?

121,"
I [17M] have had a pretty rough year. I won’t go into it but I’ve had to go through multiple near death experiences, hospitalisations, was kicked out of my house by my physically and emotionally abusive stepdad, and had to talk multiple people out of killing themselves multiple times despite by mental state being just as bad if not worse than theirs. I was catatonically depressed, had something of an identity crisis and had constant panic attacks and flashbacks. 

I’ve been getting better lately, and I’m starting to like my old self again. But today I’ve been freaking out over stuff that is so small in comparison to everything else I’ve been through. 

1: When I woke up, I was messaged by an old online friend. For several months I had to constantly talk her out of killing herself and eventually became her emotional life support. For a while she became quite manipulative and abusive towards me, but she eventually started getting better. I was proud off myself for being able to help her through everything, and even more proud of her for being able to help herself. After she started getting better I decided to start putting some distance between us, and since then we’ve only spoken to each other every couple weeks. This morning she messaged me and we talked for a bit. She’s doing well, and I’m really happy for her, but talking to her can sometimes be a bit tiring because of all the pain and bad memories I’ve got attached to her.

2: The moment I got up my mum started forcing me to study for an exam I’ve got coming up. I studied both today and yesterday, and I just couldn’t today. I’ve been emotionally exhausted after everything I’ve been through, and schoolwork just stresses me out more and takes away my ability to calm myself down and regulate my mental state. When I said I wasn’t feeling today and just needed the day to chill, she just said “You never feel well” and kept trying to force me to study. I kept trying to tell her nicely that I didn’t want to today. She kept ignoring me so I eventually got annoyed and told her to leave me alone. She then stared at me like I was in the wrong and started raging at me for daring to talk to her like that, completely ignoring that I had asked her nicely multiple times. I’m normally a fairly clam person who hates confrontation, but if she wasn’t my mother I would’ve thrown something at her for being such an inconsiderate piece of shit. 

3: I was so angry after this, and I got even more angry when a friend told me that we have a test tomorrow, which I wasn’t able to study for with my mum constantly screeching at me over an exam I have no chance of passing. 

4: I recently plucked up the courage to ask this absolutely stunning girl out, and she said yes. We were meant to go out today, but she accidentally jammed her finger in a door a couple days ago and had to cancel. She told me she was going to go to the doctor to see if her hand was fixed. I misread it and today I messaged her and asked her how getting her hand fixed went. I know this sounds like nothing, but it makes me feel so stupid and inconsiderate. And also, she said she was busy and couldn’t talk today, which made me feel even worse because I realised how annoying I am as a person and people barely tolerate me

On the bright side, I played Among Us with my best friend which cheered me up a bit. But I still feel kinda garbage, and I have to go to school tomorrow which means I have no time to rest and reset my brain.

I know I’m overreacting, but does anyone think I have a right to feel shitty today despite having been through way worse?",25Oct2020,1

Do people generally fake this emotions to create the illusion of being empathetic, or do people actually care about these things that (to me) seem so far abstracted from daily life?

129,"I (21M) recently had someone suggest to me that I might have body dysmorphia, something I’d never really considered myself to have so I wanted to share my experience and see what other people think.

So I have definitely taken issue with my appearance in the past but I don’t think there’s anyone alive who hasn’t experienced that at some point. I was a super skinny kid but in high school I started to get pretty chubby. I wasn’t bullied for it or anything but I definitely felt a little inadequate compared to the skinnier kids (it was a small country town, so I was probably one of the bigger kids in my year at the time), just noticed a few things like not getting picked in gym class or friends not inviting me to events involving physical activity like mountain biking and stuff. I also never really ate in high school, I usually didn’t eat anything until I got home in the afternoon and my only real meal was dinner. I didn’t really do this as a weight loss thing I don’t think, I just didn’t like most of the food I’d usually take to school and didn’t really have any desire to eat anyway.

I left high school and without really trying, lost most of the weight I’d gained, probably because my metabolism went through an awkward phase and so when it levelled out, I was already not eating much and so naturally I lost weight. 

This is about when I started really noticing my body and caring about how it looked. Obviously I wanted to be skinnier in high school but I didn’t even realise how big I was at the time until I looked back on old photos of me recently. At this point though, I looked skinny in a t-shirt but I felt like I had a bit of a skinny fat thing going on, no real muscle mass and just kind of a thin extra layer of fat, especially around my midsection. Honestly, this small layer of fat bothered me way more than my fat did when I was at my biggest. 

I started going to the gym at the end of last year but I had no idea what I was doing so I didn’t see any real changes. Some coworkers at the time started telling me to get on gainer shakes and eat 3000+ calories a day which I did. Fast forward to the gyms closing at in March and I felt like I’d just gotten much fatter.

I decided during quarantine to use the time I couldn’t lift to trim away as much fat as possible to give me a good foundation to work off when the gyms reopened. I took it very seriously and limited myself to 1000 calories a day while still doing body weight workouts. I did this for 3 months and dropped from 67kg to 59kg (I’m 6’1 btw). I still didn’t feel as lean as I wanted, couldn’t see my abs very well and things like that, but I decided that for my height I was probably very underweight. 

The gyms reopened here and I started bulking again (I thought it was the only way to build muscle) and working out for 1-2 hours a day and felt like I was starting to see muscle building instead of just fat this time but a couple months into the bulk, I just felt fat again.

So about a month ago I decided I felt gross and needed to cut some weight, so now I’ve added an additional hour of cardio in the gym to my workout, now spending about 2-3 hours in the gym a day on average and also actively trying to do 10000 steps a day outside the gym. I eat around 2200 calories because at that amount I’m losing weight but can still see that I’m definitely gaining muscle.

So I was talking to someone about my workout habits and also about how even though I still feel like I have some fat to lose off my lower abs, for the first time maybe ever, I’m starting to like seeing my body in the mirror and feel good about it and I feel like if I keep this up for another month or two I might even feel comfortable taking my shirt off at the beach and stuff. They told me that I didn’t even have fat to lose back before I started working out and in their opinion I definitely didn’t have any to lose now. They said that 3 hour workouts was overkill and that if I’m doing all that and am still not happy enough with my body to take my shirt off around others that I should look into body dysmorphia.

So what do you think? I always kind of assumed that everyone gets stuff like this to some extent but am I really at the extreme end of that?",25Oct2020,1

i told my mom that i’m depressed, she handled it badly. i don’t like seeing her blaming herself because i’m depressed. I’m so tired. She doesn’t understand that it’s not because of her. I’m so tired. 

I’m so tired of these recurring images of the trauma inflicted upon me by a former friend two years ago. I’m so tired of feeling that my life got delayed because of this person. I’m so tired of all the bad decisions I made because of him. I’m so tired of having to bear this trauma he caused me. I’m so tired of not even knowing what’s genuine or not anymore. I’m so tired of the fact that I pushed people away... because I was too hurt to be vulnerable again. I’m so tired of being tired to fight it off. I’m so tired of having to go away and hide from my old friends, our mutual friends... because talking to them triggers the trauma. I’m so tired of the fact that horrible people like him, exists. 

I’m so tired because I’m stuck at this home. I try to distract myself by doing the things i love, but it doesn’t help anymore. I don’t have anywhere else to go to. I don’t have the money to go to the psych. I’m so tired of my sheets soaked in my tears every night. I’m just so tired. I just want to hide.",25Oct2020,1

It feels like I’m not anxious anymore, I just don’t really care, I don’t dive deep in these concerns anymore. Do you think this is a negative thing that needs to be addressed?

138,"For those of you who read my last post, you'll be as peeved as I am to learn that I'm still on an air mattress and will be for a good wee while.

In August my flat got flooded, in September I got accepted onto my masters and then I got a job too. My life may have been down, but it wasn't out. 

Yesterday I quit my job after finding out that I won't be moving back into my flat until at least the end of January 2021. I was planning on committing suicide last night, I didn't know how I just needed it all to stop. Luckily for me, and unluckily for me too I guess, my mum needs me. She relies on me for shopping, paying her bills, cleaning and getting her dressed. 

I genuinely don't know how to put my feelings into words, all I do know is that I can't fake my smile anymore. It's physically painful to pretend I'm fine right now. 

I think I'm just gonna get my assignment done, then take a few days to just get baked and watch some shitty TV. 

Sorry for bringing all of this here, I hope that you guys are keeping well and safe during these unprecedented times.

139,"I have various types of OCD. Will only mention those which are bothering me right now. 

I have constantly created and deleted various social media accounts all these years. Everytime I create an account, I feel this will be permanent and I won't delete it. But something or other happens. I regret creating it for reasons like adding/communicating with people and I feel the only way to ghost them is to delete. Or I feel all the content I absorb such as news, or the pages I follow are too much for me to handle. Or I just get bored and think I'll never join again. 

I have this weird desire where I'll be a troll on Facebook and relentlessly shitpost and create an image for myself as a very very edgy and woke person. I feel like not expressing my weirdness on the internet is like wasting my potential. 

I tried going nosurf by deleting all my accounts. I tried sticking to just Reddit. I read posts about people being happy after deleting social media and how productive and refreshed they feel. I deleted Reddit but I just can't keep away from my phone (I am a phone addict). After deleting all social media accounts  still I couldn't be happy. I suspect it is because it is just a way of coping and to get away from madness at my home. I keep on deleting my Reddit everytime because I never stay satisfied with my username. Or even if I liked it when I made this account I'll feel it's not good enough.

I created this account and thought I'll keep it blank but my urges to make posts here got the better of me. And even though that was not my intention, when I grab lot of karma I feel like going for more. 

Also the fact that if I have nothing else to do on Reddit I'll just search random words on Reddit and see if anything interesting enough posts come up to waste my time. 

Meditation didn't work for me. I also have this bad habit of using phone soon after getting up in the morning. So ya it's the whole day. 

I'm really fed up of creating and deleting accounts. But I can't control my urges. Idk what to do.",25Oct2020,1
140,"This may have been posted before but I can not stress enough how much of an impact this weighted blanket has had on my life!!! 

For the first time in FOREVER, I have had the most restful two nights sleep in a row and I can’t quite believe it!

If, like me, you are someone who struggles with hyperactivity, anxiety, ocd ritualistic behaviours, constant fidgeting and feeling like you have to be on the move non stop, racing heart, the pit in your stomach of dread and just generally feeling not content just sitting still, watching tv or laying in bed the weighted blanket is for you!!! 

The weight of the blanket just seems to smother you into a sense of total calmness, it forces you to be still and slow down your breathing all the while giving you the feeling that you’re being cuddled all over and it really is so comforting!!!! It’s so heavy that it really is an effort to get up so it forces you to sit still, chill and allows you to relax!

Anyway I had to share as the blanket I found was very reasonable priced (£27.99) and the impact it has had is just too good not to share!! 

So if you have heard about weighted blankets and can’t decide wether it’s for you, BELIEVE ME IT IS!!! 💓

141,"I have a really strange problem with cutlery. I find it really stressful/uncomfortable/paralysing if I have to use cutlery that doesn't match. Or if the cutlery drawer isn't organised, or has too many different types of cutlery (a mix of styles). Or if all the forks are the same except one, I don't like touching the odd one out.

My fiance knows about this weird quirk and always helps me out (like if we're at a friend's he will help me discreetly make sure I have a matching set).

A new housemate recently moved in with her jumble of mix and match cutlery which she added to the drawer. I decided it was time for me to ""get over"" my cutlery thing. I tried really hard but got to the point it was making me feel ""ill"" for lack of a better word. I had to confess my quirk, and ask if we could separate our cutlery or get rid of the non uniform stuff.

I thought she was going to laugh at me. But she just said ""oh you've got an ocd? Yeah no worries. Do what you need to do"". I was completely taken aback. I'd never thought of it as OCD. I told my fiance that there was a name for my ""weird cutlery thing"" and he too was just like ""yeah, I know it's OCD"".

143,"Hey guys. I just had the sudden thought to post in here for some help. 
I'm a 20yo male and I know for a fact I'm a control freak, extremely jealous and easily annoyed. 

I'll start off by telling you a bit about myself. I am a rather outgoing fake-it-til-you-make-it introvert who is more than happy living how I do. I have 3 extremely close friends and my family, and that's all I need. I experienced a pretty severe depression earlier this year due to losing my job to covid (I am an apprentice chef) and it was rough. Although I fucking hate it, I'm pretty successful at my job which I have since regained and can't wait til I'm qualified to get out of. I spoke to my doctor and was prescribed antidepressants which worked wonders for me. They completely ""fixed"" my mental stability and made me happy again which I'll always be grateful for. I have 2 extremely loving and supporting parents who I definitely care about pleasing too much. I am single and always have been, and not interested in a relationship yet. I spend 90% of my time chilling at home at my own pace and really only go out when I want or need to, I'm still in lockdown so I can't anyway. 

I have an issue with control. I don't know why or where it comes from but I can't help but feel the need to always be in control and expect people to do things how I want them, and I have trouble accepting everyone is different and I get very annoyed whenever friends disagree with me or don't do what I want. I fucking hate this about myself and wish I could erase it but no matter how hard I try to I just can't stop acting like this. I don't think my friends notice it that much, they just think I can be a bit full on at times. I also think I can come across as bossy, an asshole etc even to my family.

I'm extremely clingy to my friends too and get upset/jealous whenever they don't want to hang out. I'd really like to stop this behavior as it will be damaging to my relationships and it's not fair to treat my friends like this. Although all of my mates are like family to me and it'll be hard to break the bonds, I worry about how they feel/will feel about me and get very anxious and self conscious about it. 

It's not always like this however, I'm a very caring loving person who will always do anything for anyone no matter the cost and I absolutely love and appreciate everyone around me and feel like they feel the same with me. I'd really like some insight into what could be making me act like this so I can work on myself to be a better person. I always strive to be a better me but recently Ive really been wondering about myself.

Maybe I'm exaggerating, idk. It's probably an esteem thing as I'm extremely jealous and self conscious. I have a alot fake (or real??? Idk) confidence with socializing etc but I seem to struggle with truly believing in myself. I've been told I'm extremely good at my job which I don't believe and I have very nice things which I've paid for but don't feel like I own, or deserve and I'm never satisfied. 

I've pondered whether or not im truly displaying narcissistic behavior or anything like that or whatever but I wouldn't go that far.

I feel like a selfish piece of shit for feeling like this. I read the stories in here and peole are facing abuse abd homelessness and other terrible things and are strong.

I don’t have these problems I’m in college (fucking up real bad this semester) and live with my parents and have a job. No one abuses me and I’m able to pay for my with my money I saved up don’t ever want to ask my fam to help.

Why do I feel like this then?  Since  around spring 2019 I feel like a worthless sack of shit and a disappointment. I’m doing terrible in a class I have the lowest grades I’ve ever had in college. It’s because I have no motivation for anything  I’m always tired even after sleeping for 12 hrs. I used to love doing homework, now I do it hours before it’s do and wonder why I have shit grades. I miss obsessing over baking that’s all I used to do and I stopped. 

My mind is always racing the whole time I’m awake I’m arguing with myself then I space out for like a min and forget was I arguing with myself about and do it all over again, sometimes I feel like I’m not even in my body that someone else is controlling me.

The worst thing is I feel like I don’t even love my family anymore. I forgot what love feels like. I will buy them whatever they want to show that I care but I don’t feel love like I used to. I don’t really feel anything much anymore just anger annoyance.

I critique every movement I make throughout the day especially at work. When I get home I just cringe at everything and hate myself even more for being a dumbass. I start punching myself to feel better. Now my arm is dumb so idk what I did lol. I wish incould just die but I can’t hurt my niece and nephews they are all under 10.

152,"Hey gang,

I think I'm struggling with my mental health. I've been pretty unhappy for the last few weeks, I guess. But I'm not quite sure what it is that's upsetting me.

I am feeling completely guilty about being depressed at the moment. Like, everything is an effort, and I just can't bring myself to do, or enjoy, anything that I once found joy in. Growing up I would play videogames and watch anime every day, and read books and immerse myself in amazing worlds, but nowadays I just cannot give a fuck about anything, at all.

The only thing getting me through my days are a handful of really close friend I've met online, but at the moment, I can't even spend time with them, which is really weighing heavily on me. I would love nothing more than to just meet up and spend time with people I care about, but because of this corona shit, I can't even see someone I care about an hour away, cause we're both in the strictest levels of lockdown in the UK.

It wouldn't be so bad, but I feel guilty about how I'm acting at the moment. Objectively, my life isn't bad, at all. I have a job that makes a difference in the world, I'm moving across the planet to start a completely new adventure, doing my absolute dream job, I have 3/4 extremely close friends who clearly care about me a lot, so...why do I have this feeling of guilt about feeling depressed? 

I think the fact that I should have been in Japan for 6 weeks now, and that we're just in this...perpetual state of limbo just fucking...God, it's really affecting me. It feels like there's no light at the end of the tunnel.

I feel extremely guilty about doubting my friendships too. I have people who routinely check up on me, and take the time to talk to me, and I've even had one friend who's sent me stuff in the post to help pick me up when she knows I've been feeling blue. But then 1/2 of my friends will leave me on read, and I keep thinking to myself, ""Oh well, they're clearly talking to each other about me, why do they hate me so much""

153,"hey F18 lookin for some possible diagnoses, ofc i’ll take everything with a grain of salt but here goes

i’ve had serious depression for at least a year, some situational depression in the past but it’s gone far past that—am intensely suicidal (but won’t kill myself cause I don’t wanna hurt my family and friends)
but the thing is

I am almost sure I have mania sometimes..
it’s usually pretty brief periods like one or two days, i’ll just get incredibly impulsive n jittery and need to move and “do something stupid” like try a new drug or hook up w strangers or some shit.
and during those times i’m not sad but still v suicidal

e.g. i’m p manic rn, in the last like 30 hrs i’ve relapsed on almost everything I could’ve relapsed on
(I cut more than I ever have, purged for the first time in months, had a guy over at 4am, did ketamine, tried to buy oxys, got crossed, have eaten close to nothing, i’m not sure if i’m remembering everything it’s a lot 
this is one of the worse ones tho)

also I came to the terms with the fact that I have some degree of anxiety a few months ago, I get like little panic attacks and stuff 

strange thing is, I am relatively very functional considering all this bullshit—i’m at a good UC, getting good grades, all that shit, n i’d say the majority of my time I spend in a relatively neutral emotional state, my depression/anxiety/mania is very episodic and intense for shortish periods of time

other things that could be helpful:
-I have a lot of childhood trauma :D my mom n I have a fucked up relationship oh and also my friend killed himself 3 yrs ago n that was my first run-in w situational depression 
-been seeing a therapist for 9 months ish continuously, just started a DBT group
-I have a hormonal iud I got last year
-mental illness runs in the family, e.g. paranoia aspergers schizophrenia anxiety depression EDs
-i’ve been on lexapro for like 6 weeks now and wellbutrin in addition for 3 weeks, but the mania shit long preceded it,
it hasn’t always been here for sure but i’m worried i’m treating the wrong thing by taking ssris

155,"In the last month, it has become clear that my mental health has taken a dramatic backslide on the progress that took painstaking years of effort to achieve. 

I find myself unable to socialize with good friends without having a panic episode. Even a friendly stranger being chatty at a store is enough to set it off. Hobbies that bring me pleasure (videogames, gardening, music) set it off. If I partake in any interaction or activity that brings me joy, I end up losing my shit. 

My panics are destructive and embarrassing - I lived with repeated traumas with an abusive alcoholic father growing up. At the time, being able to escape the situation (using violence if necessary, only defensive) and make a ton of noise and call people was necessary. 

When I feel this way, I go through a series of stages -
1. Feeling of impending doom 
2. Becoming uncharacteristically chatty and outgoing
3. Suddenly I can tell I am too intense
4. Running through coping mechanisms healthy and unhealthy. When tapping, pacing, ASKING TO LEAVE dont work (I am terrified to leave without permission), I will seek out coffee, tea, alcohol, food, really anything nearby that may alter my mood. It never works. 
5. Trapped. If I am here, someone told me ""please dont go"" or ""you cant leave NOW.... XYZ reasons"", and this for whatever reason always always sets me off.
6. I completely self estruct, hurting myself in any way I can.

While I have never kicked these behaviors entirely, they had become maneagable through therapy and medication (with the occasional misfire). How do I manage this sudden regression? I dont want to let my past ruin everything I worked so hard to achieve. This pandemic and the resultant isolation has brought my social coping mechanisms to ground zero. I miss having hobbies. 

This all started again full force when I visited a couple friends for an evening fire in their backyard a month ago - I panicked at the end. This last week I had to postpone a welding test after spending hundreds on hotels and travel because a friendly server who I had ordered takeout from was kind of chatty and I panicked. My partner had to drive 2.5 hours at night to come and get me. 2 days later, it happened again following a car trip with a friend to retrieve my vehicle that I left hours away - and we had a nice ride, they told me how much they value our friendship and were so kind.  I haven't made it past a load screen since spring, and haven't touched my instruments or listened to music in about the same time. Anytime I attempt to have fun, I am filled with dread and anxiety.

Im living in fear, and my wonderful partner is starting to suggest maybe I should be a 'stay at home' partner if this continues as my panics are so disruptive. He is willing to rearrange everything to accomodate me but thats so unfair for him. I'm dreading my job that I love. My therapist is reducing our sessions because I panic after. It would be easier if everyone treated me like the piece of trash that I feel like. I want to just live again.

To make things worse. After coming out of the initial spiral I visited the adoption agency to find my biological mother had been sending me letters cards and gifts for those 18 years. Se really heartbreaking stuff in the letters. 

So i ask through the adoption agency to contact her. She never replies. So I took it on myself to find her. After 2 years I do. And I reach out. I email her and eventually get a response saying she wasn't in a position to know me right now and would get in touch at the end of summer. That summer must have never ended because she never contacted me again. 

I'm now 28 and will be moving home soon and want a new start away from my last demons(depression, addiction issues). And as part of my new start I was thinking of burning all the old letters I received from my biological mother. A way of wiping the skate clean and truly giving up that hope that has haunted me these last few years. 

Does anybody have any advice on this do they think this might help me?

Thank you in advance for any help or suggestions made. Have a great day",25Oct2020,1

167,"So, due to my mental illness, I struggle with hygiene, especially showering. So having hair means I am reminded that I have gone too long without showering but it takes so much energy to wash it. It takes so much for me to even get in the shower, and I like to be as quick as possible so I can get out as soon as possible. So I figure it would just be easier to shave my head.

But then, I get anxious about shaving my head because I also have awful teeth. My apathy also extends to that aspect of hygiene. So if I shave my head, I'm scared that my nasty teeth will be that much more prominent. Masks are honestly making me more confident because no one can see my teeth, but I know I can't wear them forever because at some point, America will recover (maybe) and if I keep wearing my mask, people will stare at me.

I'm not looking for advice or anything. I just wanted to get this off my chest. Although, if anyone has had a similar experience, it would be cool to know I'm not the only one having this struggle",25Oct2020,1

I deleted anything that *didn’t bring me joy* which meant deleting my Facebook app as a whole, and unfollowing pages/ people on Instagram that I didn’t care for. I only follow creators that will make me happy. I don’t follow influencers and celebrities who make me feel bitter about my life. I follow so many mental health and self development creators. I certainly **do not** follow any news forums. 

So I’ve compiled a list of my favorite creators/ organizations in hopes that you find what you’re looking for! Forgive me cause I’m on mobile so idk how this is gonna turn out. Note that these are all Instagram pages and require the @ in front of them when searching.

169,"Five years after the big Ashley Madison data breach, I only recently realized how unethical and irresponsible journalists may have handled this scandal. I now know at least one of them has treated the leaked data as if its users were cheaters and perverts. But fact is, probably many of them weren’t even a cheater. A part of the so-called second love community just tries to discretely maintain their model of open relationships, because otherwise society stigmatises them.

171,"I’m just venting because I know what the issue is and I know I’m working on it but sometimes I just want to talk (or type I guess) about it. 
All my life , since elementary school and up, I’ve struggled with anxiety when I have to talk to people or be in a social situation. At its worst, I get fuzzy headed and feel like I’m looking at the world under water when I’m out in public, and at its best, I just dwell on every social interaction I just had for like the next 3 months (usually longer though.) 

I guess I’m venting because I don’t understand why I have such a hard time. I used to think there was something wrong with me mental wise because I would get so exhausted after speaking with someone or I’d get easily annoyed by people’s presence. I went through a really long time during my late childhood to teen years (so like 12-17) where all I wanted was to wake up one day and everyone else be gone. I wanted no one around me, I wanted no one to talk to, I wanted everything to be quiet... because noise overwhelms me so much. 

Add to that the fact I felt like figuring people and their different facial expressions and tones and attitudes were going to take the rest of my life and I just hated everyone. Obviously some of this was normal teenage “go away I want to be alone” angst but a lot of this was me letting my anxieties wants take over. I didn’t even consider that that wasn’t really me.

Well now I’m 22, I have 2 kids, a fiancé and I’m struggling even more in adult life because I realize... I do like people. And I do like being around people. I get lonely a lot. But I still have such a hard time relating. Social interactions are very foreign to me and I’m always on “gaurd” planning out the next time it’s my turn to talk, or what my script of conversations are for the day and anything beside those conversations totally throws a wrench in my plans and I have to re evaluate. I find that unless I’m drunk or high (which I haven’t been high since like 19) I can never go anywhere without thinking I’m not doing good enough, I’m not enough, I stick out, everyone’s watching me whispering about me, or out to get me.

She’s the type of person who is easy to fool, extremely slow in following any conversation and incapable of understanding even the most basic logic. Her naïveté of the world around her is sometimes astounding, considering that she’s pushing 60. The main issue I have is that she has odd behaviors, such as repeating the same question more than 3 times in a short conversation. I would’ve thought this would be maybe an early sign of Alzheimer’s, but she’s always done this and shows no sign that she didn’t actually remember asking the question. She also has violent changes in mood that are coupled with what would not be considered sane behavior, but she’s able to control these in public. She’s always abused alcohol, and maybe that had something to do with it, but apparently she’s been like this since at least her late 20’s. She is extremely difficult to live with, hence why she’s spent years practically alone, but she’s also been through far more traumatic experiences than the average person.

175,"I don’t know if this is the right sub.  I’m doing relatively okay but somethings been  going on but idk if I should be worried. I’ve noticed a pattern that every time I take something that I think that alters my mental state I start to freak out. It didn’t happen with alcohol but it happened the first time I smoked weed. I felt like I was panicking, and I was obviously high but I would get so scared that I would go to the E.R, or that I wouldn’t be where I’m at, or worse that I might pass. I think the E.R is the fact that I did black out and ended up there once when I drank. It was scary but I got over it. Over the summer I got a medical procedure and I think I started freaking out again. Last night I went out with friends and I barely had two sips and It happened. The common thing that happens is that in my mind I feel okay, like it’s not me fully when I’m in my normal state but I’m aware of what’s going on. However, my thoughts are often racing and I start overthinking. If I see something happening that doesn’t make sense I wonder if it’s happening to me or I’m scared that I’m not really where I am and wonder if something bad is gonna happen. When I noticed it happening I tend to move away from the situation and just sit or sleep somewhere because I’m scared that I’m not safe.  Idk if this example helps, but I barely had anything to drink but I was on the couch and my friends were drunk and doing drunk things lol. But for me I was on the couch and I knew where I was and my mind was okay (i barely took anything) but I was sitting there and my friends was vomiting and crying and the one thought that kept on popping up was “what if this is happening to me “ “what if I’m the one crying or vomiting” “what if I’m not really where I’m at” or what if “something happened and I’m gonna end up in the hospital “ and sometimes I just feel like the stuff they are doing is just happening to me or just like they are saying what I’m thinking. My mind knows that’s not the case but it freaks me out and I guess it happens everytime I’m in near a substance that alters my mind. And I constantly ask those around to make sure I’m okay because I really want to make sure I’m safe and others around me are. At first, it was scary and my heart was racing but I’ve been meditating and I did see a counselor so I don’t freak out freak out when it happens but it’s kinda annoying and I’m just wanna make sure i’m okay.",25Oct2020,1

They said she would regain her memories slowly, which has already started to a degree, and released her. Obviously to not make the panic of the situation worse on the way to the hospital we told her the her husband was out of town and that is why he didn't come to the hospital. It doesn't feel right letting her believe that. Our plan last night was to tell her about his passing this morning. But I am not sure if that kind of trauma could effect the memory recovery process adversely. Also, it is going to hit her hard.

I feel myself thinking about the cross my mother gave me for Christmas two years ago, and what it means to me. I'm not religious by any means, and I have no faith in things unseen. I hold it still, and find that I want to pray or at least declare something to myself: a mantra maybe. I am stronger now, and need to say less to others, but more to myself. With what is happening to me, I can see that nobody has my answers for me, and though I love those around me, I don't wish to talk about this anymore. A few weeks ago, I was suicidal  but now I feel content with existence. Will that flee into obscurity again? Perhaps. So for now, while I still have this, all I want is to help bear the load of others while I have the fortitude, and contemplate my own existence.

The strange part is that I am not strewn to express my soul to anyone. I simply acknowledge my existence and see that the path out is through. There are parts of this which are biological, which is why changing my diet had such a noticeable impact. Some things still remain: I need a job, I need education, I need exercise and I need routine. I'm hoping that someday soon, things will align and I will have escaped the pit I'd been placed in that I'd learn to love to dig.

183,"Little bit of back story: my waters broke at 21 weeks, but were most likely leaking since weeks 18-19 (called PPROM). I was initially told my baby had a less than 1% chance of making it to viability (23 weeks) and I would most likely give birth in 24-48 hours, a week at most.
But I didn't. I was admitted to the hospital at 23 weeks and stayed on complete bedrest until I was induced at 34. We were told that even at 34 weeks he may not survive because his lungs might be too undeveloped due to the lack of amniotic fluid. The best case scenario was him being on a ventilator for weeks and a VERY long NICU stay. I spent 82 days laying in that hospital bed preparing myself for the worst. Wavering between grief and cautious optimism. Luckily my husband could stay, but I could have no other visitors due to COVID19, making a lonely experience even more lonely. I already have CPTSD/BPD/Bipolar II, so I had panic attacks every day.
When I gave birth on October 4, after 2 1/2 days of labor, he came out weighing one ounce shy of 6 lbs and he could move his limbs (PPROM sometimes causes arm and leg problems that need surgery). Best of all, he came out crying. Something we were told wouldn't happen. He could even breathe on his own. It was hands down the happiest moment of my life. I've never felt more relief. He's now in the NICU and doing great. He should be coming home soon.

Despite the happy ending that had way less than 1% chance of happening, my brain kind of got stuck in grief mode. Coming home after being discharged was horrible because it was just how we had left it in July, bringing all those horrible memories back. I'm still struggling to live in my house without feeling sad (we moved in right before I got pregnant). I find that it's hard to move on from those feelings of grief and loss even though everything turned out better than anyone imagined. I have a feeling that my CPTSD became even more complex. I'm sure things will get better once he's home, because he makes me so incredibly happy. But the whiplash transition from grief to happiness has left my brain confused. Going from hospital to home has also been tough. I forgot what independence felt like. What living in the outside world was like. What walking and standing felt like.

TL;DR- I (18F) struggle with anxiety, depression, and possibly schizophrenia. When I confronted my mother, she said I didn’t need a therapist. How do I get her to believe I truly do?

I’m an 18F. Since eight, Ive struggled with anxiety. It’s been a living hell to deal with. 

(TW) 

At fourteen, I started to consider self harm to feel better. I didn’t take medicine then nor did I have a therapist of any kind. At fifteen, I actually thought life was too difficult and that I would never be any better than I was. I was considering suicide. That’s when I knew I needed someone. 

I went to school the day after considering death and had a severe panic attack. I was checked out of school and taken to a doctor. The doctor said I had severe anxiety and depression and even suggested a therapist for me. My mom sat in the room and told both me and the doctor that she’d take me.

The place that was suggested I go was also a place where drug addicts tend to go for rehab and also therapy. But I wanted to go so bad because I knew I needed someone to talk to before I hurt myself.

Yet, it’s been 3 years since that doctors appointment and I still haven’t been to a therapist of any kind. At sixteen I was put on medicine for my mental health and was suggested again for a therapist or counselor. 

After months of waiting to know if I was going to one or not, I had enough of waiting. I yelled at my mom one day, saying she never wanted me to go to one in the first place. She yelled back at me saying she had looked and found no one to view me since I was in a weird age range for therapists. I believed her.

Now I’m 18 and have shown signs of schizophrenia. I’m terrified to know if I have this disease or not but when I mentioned it to my mom, she seemed to think I was faking. So I haven’t mentioned it again. 

Again this year I asked for a therapist after corona died. I got the response that just because I had a bad day doesn’t mean I need a therapist. I am frustrated and know I need one even more than I did at 15.

Since 17, ive actually resorted to self harm when something is wrong. I’ve hid everything and blamed cuts on my hands on my cats. I’m tired of lying and I just need to vent to a professional instead of my friends.

186,"I'm asking how should I proceed with my problem and whether there are possible diagnostics for it.

All my life, I had been a perfectionist and overachiever. I am quite an ambitious person by nature. I own my own blog where I write book reviews and am still in school so I don't need a sturdy paycheck. (I am just including some background information that might have a key to solving my problem).

Anyway, for the past year, I had been obsessed with a certain type of lifestyle that I can't possibly achieve because of my occasional procrastination. It is the busy-life type of lifestyle, where you are busy all day long, going to conferences, meetings, speeches, interviews, and do your job on the same day. I personally enjoy achieving multiple things on the same day. It gives me satisfaction that I do not get if I had procrastinated the whole day.

My procrastination problem is that I usually spend my whole day web-surfing and not doing anything in general. I hate when that happens and by the end of the unproductive day, I feel like I don't deserve to live. I always think that tomorrow/next week/next month/next year would be perfect. I am a huge fan of starting over or turning over a clean slate.

My problem is that for the past week, I try to achieve as much as possible in one day, write blog posts, update my social media information, do cleaning, do my homework, and do a book photoshoot, but I do not get any more satisfaction. It's just not enough for me. I love working, but not just busywork. I want to achieve something more. I want to travel, open shops, do business. I don't want to sit around typing the same exact generic book review over and over again. 

I don't want to procrastinate anymore. Please, don't make me procrastinate. I hate it so much.

I want to spice my life a little. I want to achieve more. I want to live my life how I want to live it. I want to be busy all day long doing interesting things.

This obsession with a certain busy lifestyle is ruining my current lifestyle. Honestly, I am afraid of the way that I am obsessed with being busy and doing work. It's not like me, and instead of procrastinating like I usually do, I am doing stuff. And I am not getting satisfaction.

He's not a good guy and I know that now. He would repeatedly lie, when confronted with consequences to his actions, he would shift blame and play the victim, he even threw his girlfriend and best friend under the bus to save his own ass and to look like the good guy. He's a serial cheater as well. He would make passes at me and unprovoked, he would tell his girlfriend that I was the one making passes at him. Just unprovoked. From sources in his friends group, I've heard he gaslights his girlfriend. Everyone just believes him. All of his friends know he's a shitty, awful person yet they still hang out with him. I don't get it. He has lied about friends, about family members being dead, about his girlfriend, and even about where he lives. He told a friend of his that he lived in a mansion (for backstory, his pal was supposed to be spending Christmas with him) and when his friend saw the house and told him ""Hey, I thought you lived in a mansion, not that anything is wrong about living in an apartment but why would you lie?"" And instead of telling his friend, ""I was just ashamed of my living situation"", he made up ANOTHER lie saying "" oh we're just staying here temporarily, the mansion is being renovated. "" The lying doesn't even stop there, he fakes mannerisms (I.e being drunk at parties, faking accents, etc). 


In 2019, he did something to me that was unforgivable. When confronted with it, he never denied what he did. Just kept saying that he was planning on killing himself for days because of it and he deserved everything he was going to get because of what he did. Then when he thought his friend knew (I didn't tell him friend until after what *HE* did. I did tell his friend after he snapped on me though because I will be damned if someone starts a smear campaign about me so they can look good) he, all of a sudden, just flipped and started threatening me, calling me a child, hoe, a liar, etc. Then later on, maybe two weeks later, he comes to me saying he wants to be friends. Correct me if I'm wrong but this sounds like a guilty person trying to save their own ass YET again. No matter what he called me, the words ""you're lying"" or ""I never did this"" never came out of his mouth. Not once. 

I forgave him for everything he does but I won't forgive him for that. Everything was water under the bridge only for him to ruin my life again.

I have Severe ADHD, Autism, Anxiety and Depression. 
I went to my therapist and she reccommended staying at hospital for a few days to help me communicate better and help my emotions because i’m super emotionally sensative. 

She saw a cut on my wrist and she wanted to see it so i let her and there was about 10 more from where i had cut me. 

I just started crying alot and she tried to calm me down but it didn’t work much so my mum had to come in. 

I stayed at the hospital for 3 days and my nurse that was looking after my was really really nice. She helped me if i was sad and stayed with me until i had calmed down and she drawed with me sometimes. She gave me a fidget toy as a reward for being “really awsome” and it made me feel good that i had been good. She helped me communicate with people better and things. 

I’m back at home now but i feel kinda bad again and i have been crying alot and i don’t know what to do. I’m just hugging a teddy and stuff to calm me down.

It can last up to many months and can only be fully gone if I sell or return the thing I bought. I tend to get reclusive, where I don’t want to be around anybody, and very easily angered/ annoyed when I’m in this state. As well as causing me to be very sad.

I know buyers remorse is a pretty common thing for people but I don’t know if it’s to this extent. Have any of you experienced something like this and how would you recommend working on it?",25Oct2020,1
192,"Hi I hope this is an right place to ask for help if not I apologize

growing up I used porn as a crutch, my home life was not very emotionally nurturing and  there are lots of holes in my mind that cause me subconscious pain and effect my life, it is continuing circle that prevents me from solving the problems, I use porn to fill the void and that disconnects me from others which makes me want to go to porn again. My sexual appetite also has not diminished and frankly is maddeningly and makes me hate my self and I have problems with managing it or embracing it which I know is the goal

I have done addiction counselling and life coaching for several years which have reduced the amount quite alot  but not entirely I do realise that's its because I have more inner work to do ut it comes back to the same loop being unable to connect also wanting to connect because of childhood stuff but also of my experience with other women that have made me avoidant and unwilling

my life is a mess and im sorry to have put this out there any advice would be helpful im looking for but not limiting to anything else 

good techniques to help with loneliness

any advice on how to give pleasure in a way that dose not involve porn meditations 

any other advice

I do want to have a fulfilling sexual life but i feel that I never will I think that my lack of connection when young means that I never do want or be able to connect to people or for them to intimately connect to me",25Oct2020,1

194,"This description of my thoughts are unfinished. As time goes on, I will try to update it more and more. 

**Mental Information:**

I mainly think about three things:

Events that occurred in the past,

The responsibilities that I have right now.

The things that I want to be in the future. 

On top of that, I am a perfectionist. I am willing to work extremely hard for the goals that I want to achieve. As a result, this leads to me ruminating about something that I thought I did incorrectly. This leads me to ruminate about things in the future, due to the fact that I am worried about anything else bad happening. 

Usually, when I ruminate nowadays, I keep on thinking about it for days, which extremely distracts me from my work, causing me to not be able to get the score that I want on other things. It is a chain reaction. 

Because of this, I am extremely stressed all the time. Every single minute. As a result, I don’t even have the drive to procrastinate. Since procrastination relies on the stress of working extremely hard under time, I feel as though I can’t take any more stress. If I do, my head is going to explode. 

Because I am extremely stressed, I don’t feel the need to do much because I am already having a difficult time staying awake. I am also behind on nearly every class, 2 of which are nearly to the point of no recovery(this could be my perception. Maybe it's an over exaggeration of my mind thinking that it's impossible but idk.)

I try to create an effort to bring forward a lot of things in my head, which exaggerates only some parts that I want. As a result, I always forget about certain things, like turning in an assignment. 

As a result of all this stress, I confuse myself, and I can barely use basic logic to even live. I can’t really think for myself, let alone even do it properly. 

I know that being a perfectionist at this stage in my life is extremely bad. Although, I am worried that if I lose my perfectionist self, then I will not be able to work hard. I have an extreme hunger for achieving things.

I never really thought of killing myself, because I have goals that I still want to accomplish. I just feel like I’m playing down all of these mental problems as if though its a joke, like how my parents think of mental problems.

I think that I have maintained such a high level of stress to the point where I am at burnout. My head feels numb and I can't really think. 

**Physical Information:**

1. I am 15 years old. A boy. 
2. I am a relatively healthy person. I eat 3-5 meals per day due to my fast metabolism.
3. I do not get sunlight a lot, but much more than other friends, who are all mentally ok, at least I think. 
4. Unfortunately, because of my thoughts, I do not sleep a lot. Often, I sleep between 11-1 and wake up at 6-7.
5. I like to think that I am relatively smart, maybe in the top 5 percent of students in the US. In my competitive school, around the 50 percent mark. 

TLDR: I feel like I’m in the max level of stress all the time. I feel overwhelmed. I can’t even trust my own logic. I have high goals that I want to achieve but I feel like I am dying at the same time. 

How do I get rid of this stress? And how do I get rid of this feeling that I can't do it? I'll do whatever it takes to do so. I can't really trust myself to choose which path to go on.",25Oct2020,1
195,"I want to start this out with saying that i know this seems completely ridiculous, but I also want you to know my position: I am a 14 yo male, I have OCD, ARFID, and I have lots of symptoms of Bipolar depression among other things, and I’m also really codependent. So, there is this girl, we‘ll call her Lily, and I really like her, now I have no concrete proof that she likes me back, but I have gathered hints. Now, my family loves me, and I know that, but I just feel so unloved, and I really can’t wait to get married, so I have taken to imagining ridiculous scenes involving Lily and me. I feel like she is a drug for me, when I am around her, I feel fine, I laugh, I joke, and that lasts until the next afternoon, when I completely crash, I get really depressed and suicidal, feeling like I’m so screwed up that how could someone ever love me? Most of the time I feel like a complete failure, like I’ll never make a positive impact on the world or anyone’s life. I haven’t told my parents that I like Lily because I’m afraid they wont approve or something stupid like that i guess. I’m a really nervous person in general, but the main thing is that I feel like Lily is my sole handle keeping me from falling into complete depression, and possible suicide, but I have no idea if there are screws holding the handle down.

196,"Hey there! So, not to brag but I’m terrible at recognizing my own emotions. Years of abuse and trauma have led me to become one hollow ass bitch but that’s neither here nor there. 
I was raised in extreme isolation, and throughout my teenage years I would get this feeling of restlessness. Like I couldn’t contain all the energy in my brain. It’s more mental than physical. It’s not necessarily a bad feeling, but it can be frustrating. I would have this extreme impulse to run away, or to create something amazing, or go to med school. It’s the feeling of needing to do something big and do it RIGHT NOW. 
As I grew older, I kept myself insanely busy. Two jobs, full time university, lots of hobbies, binge drinking, dealing with watching my best friend get horribly maimed, etc. That feeling went away because I would exhaust myself everyday.
Now I’m in my mid 20s, working part time at an easy job that basically pays the bills, and just chillin with the homies as much as possible. The world isn’t falling apart around anymore and I’m so so so bored. That feeling is back with a vengeance baby. I feel so impulsive, like I’m always on the verge of a life ruining mistake. I carry it well. I’ve been throwing myself into painting and writing and reading and working out and making new friends but I’ll be damned if I don’t have the urge to go out and get a full sleeve of ironic tattoos, marry a hooker, and go back to school. 
I can’t afford mental help but the Internet is definitely within my budget so... help me out here guys? Is this mania? Some weird facet of my PTSD? Just a little quirk in the human condition?

197,"hi. throwaway for obvious reasons &amp; i apologise if these kind of posts are made regularly; i don't want to bring up therapy to my parents who don't believe in this kinda thing - i'm 17 &amp; a female

idon't care about being a sociopath and i equally couldn't care if i come across as one

so the first attribute i have is feeling empty &amp; no remorse or guilt for anything - i could and did manipulate 4 people who trusted me so i could play them like puppets on a string to act in accordance to what i want. yeah i said sorry but there was no feeling behind the apologies i gave (i also don't understand and don't bother to care about people's emotions, but i put on a facade on how i *care so much* about them when really i couldn't care less if they didn't benefit me)

i like the feeling of being powerful over people - bossing them around just feels so euphoric for me

i can't feel love and the only reason why i get into relationships is because i like the thrill of fake loving them and seeing their hearts shatter at the realisation that i never liked them

i don't care about anyone but myself and i tend to get violent or abusive if i find out that someone will foil my plans, but this doesn't happen often as i think one step ahead so they wouldn't know

there's more symptoms i have of sociopathy but i simply don't have the energy to recall them back

198,"I’ve been with my SO for years and have noticed a rapid decline in her mental health. She’s often withdrawn and depressed and refuses to see somebody to talk about her mental state. 

I also have a self diagnosed minor case of depression, just feeling empty and sad for no reason, feeling impending doom over trivial things or nothing at all. For me it’s enough to remind myself of all the things I have and the people around me that love me to feel better. Honestly not sure if it’s artificial and I’m forcing myself to be happy but I get by but this post isn’t about my problems.

I have tried talking, I’ve tried giving distance, I’ve tried giving advice, I’ve tried giving space to sort feelings and figure out her own way but nothing I do helps.

I was abused as a child by my dad, and when I wasn’t being abused I was being neglected and locked in a bathroom In the dark. This started at just a couple weeks old and continued for years. When I was 12 I moved in with my grandmother who is extremely controlling and violent. She would hit me and throw things at me and scream at me DAILY. She controlled every aspect of my life down to what specifically I was allowed to wear and eat and she wouldn’t allow me to have friends my age and I was not allowed to speak to females at all. I was extremely depressed and went down a spiral of suicidal ideation and self harm from self deprecation. I was deeply unhappy every single day. I moved out of her house after years of that and I now live at my mothers house who treats me good and doesn’t do any of that to me. Well now that you have a backstory, back to relationships now. I ended all my relationships because the girls were not “comforting” enough to me and didn’t constantly cling onto me and give me attention. I only like girls who are clingy and possessive of me and make rules for what I can and can’t do. It makes me feel relaxed in the relationship and makes me feel loved and happy.

I know things are always changing and my plan won't go 100% as planned, if at all.

I am currently in an academic course in one of the universities in my country, which is a test alongside actual students. If I pass with a final grade of 80+, I will be able to study for a BS.c in Physics alongside high school, I am also in a big Start-Up program and I already have a good idea in my mind, I'll need the money from it on the side because of reasons you'll know soon.

So my specific plan is to finish like 1/2 of the degree in my country, then get consent from my country's defence forces (In here military is mandatory) to postpone the service to finish the degree in age 19 or 20 and be a high ranked soldier in a place in my military that involves a lot of Physics, which I will be taken for or I'll apply.

After the 3 years of service I'll go study in England or the U.S in one of the most elite unis in the world, and finish the 1 year of MS.c and Ph.D and then come back to my country to rest for a couple of months while I will get used to it and then apply for a job.

THIS WON'T STOP PLAYING IN LOOPS IN MY HEAD, I feel like I'm going crazy which is probably coming from severe anxiety.

I had a talk with my mother about it, and she said I just have no one to talk to so this is just bottled up inside, I am great with socialising but I can't be the one that actually starts the socialising, I have no close friends, only friends that I depend on because of geographical location, no other reason.

I JUST DON'T ENJOY LIFE LIKE THAT, my mother is against these ideas, but I just refuse to stop becuase of this never ending loop. I want to study but I also want to enjoy life, have REAL friends, not just geographical or people I am only friends with because of some video game or something...

221,"My fiancee has some worryingly bad anger issues. It’s not like she can’t control her temper because she can most of the time. It’s when she gets upset at small things that I get nervous. And when she does get upset, it’s not my safety I worry about, it’s her’s.

Things that have happened that concern me:

\- She got upset because the water spout on the fridge wasn’t working so she through her glass on the ground, breaking it, and while she was cleaning it up, she held onto a piece of the glass so hard she needed stitches for the cut.

\- She broke a stool because she got upset she couldn’t push it in all the way because it was getting caught on the legs on the stools beside it. I went over to help her so she didn’t lose her temper and instead, she just threw the stool causing the back to break off.

\- When she comes home upset after a day at work, she’ll work herself up to the point where she’s crying and hyperventilating, and will not calm down. She’ll hit herself too. She’ll smack her head pretty hard— hard enough to leave bruises and bumps— and will hit her head against the wall at times. She broke three of her fingers two months ago because she slammed her hand in a drawer on purpose. I know it was on purpose because I watched her do it.

\- I won’t ride in a car with her driving anymore because she gets such bad road rage. If a car cuts her off or tries to pull out in front of her, she’ll speed up instead of breaking. Funny enough, she has never been in an accident.

\- She controls it much better in public, but what I have noticed she’ll do is dig her fingernails into the skin on her wrist just under her FitBit until she bleeds. She also bites her lips— often until it bleeds— and will pick at her fingernails… until they bleed.

Overall, a lot of these instances are few and far between, but this isn’t all she has done. Usually something happens every few months, but it seems to be getting more frequent. I know her father had similar issues and took them out on her mother which does concern me. She was arrested for assault when we were in college, but I think it was in self defense or something so the charges were dropped.

Aside from these issues, I love our relationship. We have been together since college where we met through our greek houses. She is a very kind and respectful person who really wants to help those around her. She has never been violent in anyway towards me and when we argue she holds her temper well and almost never shouts. It always seems like it’s the little things like some off-handed comment someone makes or a minor inconvenience.

We have a date for our wedding in a little under a year, but I brought it up to her that I don’t want to get married until she worked on these issues as they are progressively getting worse. She got upset with me originally, but has seemed pretty withdrawn since. I feel like an asshole, but I don't know what else to do.

How can I help her with these issues before they spiral even more out of control?",25Oct2020,1

Sure good things happen. And the universe is freakishly incredible. But I think this thing we're living in, this society with all its rights and wrongs is just done now. I just cannot believe anything is happening in a natural way anymore. Every good and bad things are just controlled by bunch of strong people. I cannot seem to feel happy about good things happening because they just seem to happen to distract us from the fact that this shit is done already. I hope I don't sound negative and hopeless because I promise I'm neither.




I just really feel like hope for a good future causes us to wait for this big change. If a person got stucked inside of a cave has enough food and water, he'll likely prefer to stay safe inside. Why stepping out to the darkness and look for a way out of the forest? Someone may come and help. It may be a wise decision for him to wait for someone until his sources are done. But our waiting causes suffering of people and planet Earth. I believe that if that change ever happens one day, it'll be so fast and strong. It won't take years and years of adjustments as we thought it'd have to take. And yet, nothing on the horizon.




Aren't we aware of the fact that small steps doesn't mean anything anymore? Small victories only saves the day somewhere, when somewhere else only changes for worse. But hey life is not perfect. It could be tho. Who made us believe that it can't be perfect? Why did we even accept ""shit happens""? Don't tell me it's part of life because last time I chekced the biggest shit happened because of a respected man in suit, not because of a maniac with a knife.",25Oct2020,1

224,"I've observed that people who are suicidal tend to ask/say things like what the point of living is if there is no possibility of being happy, and/or that they simply do not see any reason to stay alive while they see many reasons to die. This is usually followed up by another person (such as myself) telling them it is the wrong decision. However, what I feel like those responders neglect to mention is the following:

We say committing suicide is not okay because, if it were normalized for example, a lot more people would be doing it (and that, if you ask me is way beyond just “not okay”). People try to prevent others from committing suicide not so that their suffering can continue; we understand that they are in pain. We try to prevent people from committing suicide by helping them find a reason to stay alive, AND attempt to cease the pain they are going through while they are living. Suicidal ideation can distort your perspective, influencing you to believe that there is no possibility of being happy, so we try to shed some light on reasons to be happy that you may just not be aware of, hence why one who is suicidal may feel like there is none.

This is just my personal perspective. I don't know how many people may or may not agree with me, but that's the way I personally see it.",25Oct2020,1
225,"Right now I’m in a state of numbness. Before this, for about 2-3 months, I was going through a phase of having 1-2 weeks of numbness and then  1-2 weeks of intense moods swings. Before this, it was just the mood swings and not much numbness. In these moods swings, I would switch between being extremely depressed and suicidal or being full of energy and fake happiness.  It’s hard to explain the fake happiness feeling but basically i still felt empty but I was laughing a lot and having a happy facial expression. I got more risky and did self harm just because I could. In both my sad and “happy” states I also got easily angered and annoyed. These moods would switch sporadically. Sometimes I would be in one mood for only a couple hours or sometimes it will last 3 days. On some rare terrible nights, I would sometimes feel both moods at the same time. I know all that sounds super dangerous and bad but this feeling of numbness is just annoying me. I feel like I’m devoid of any character or purpose. I’m also left with this feeling like I’m about to explode emotionally but I never do. In all honestly I think I’d rather be in those mood swings. I’m just wondering what I could do to get out of this state. My mom think I’m just looking for attention because I came out as bi to her a few days before telling her how I’m really feeling emotionally after stay shut about it for about a year. Which is funny because I never like attention. She then just ends up criticizing me for not having a social life since I have no friends currently. My therapist hasn’t said anything on any clinical problems. I thought previously I had BPD but i don’t have the intense fear of abandonment that others with the condition do as I generally feel insignificant to everyone so I don’t blame them if they leave. Also I don’t think I have it since ya know, I’m not feeling anything rn. (Sorry that this kind of turned into a vent post too lol). Anyway, I’m just really unsure with what’s wrong with me. Maybe I’m just suffering from isolation and I’ll be ok when school opens up again and I find a group that likes me for me. The reason I’m telling you guys this is to maybe give you some more insight into me so it maybe helps you to tackle the initial question. Anything helps, it doesn’t have to answer the main question.",25Oct2020,1

227,"So for the past 2-ish hours my dad has been complaining of feeling weird in his head. At first he described it as panicky, but I'm not sure if it is necessarily a panic or anxiety attack. He's 61 and his only medical issues (I'm aware of ) are high BP and high cholesterol. He **hasn't** described any symptoms such as difficulty breathing, shaking, heart pounding, dizziness, tunnel vision, etc. He literally says he just feels everything in his head. He also said he feels like he could just ""freak out"" at any moment. My mom suggested he take a shower to try and relax, which didn't help. Now he is out taking a walk and getting some fresh air. Otherwise for the past two hours he's just been pacing around the house.

The only other time he said he's felt like this before was after he had surgery a few years ago and was on pain medication. But, of course, he is not taking such medication now. 

Has anyone ever experienced anything like this or have any advice? He's quite a stubborn guy, so we're already having difficulty trying to help him without overwhelming him. I feel so bad, especially because I struggle with anxiety sometimes, but my symptoms aren't similar to this.",25Oct2020,1
228,"Pretty recently I have began showering 3-4 times every single day, washing my hair and body because I never feel clean. I can't stand it when my face or hair feels greasy, I feel like I can't continue my day or do the things I need to do because I need to get rid of the feeling. If I shower early in the day, I will always have to shower again shortly after because I feel sweaty and smelly and greasy very quickly afterwards. Sometimes even right after showering I feel that way so I go right back in and shower again. I'm a 17 year old girl so my parents are starting to get really upset with me for doing this but if I feel gross I have to do it and I will. I also have to do my hair a certain way and if its not done the way that I like, I can't focus the whole day and do my tasks because I feel off and weird. I always have to blow dry it straight after showering, and if I wasn't able to do that I refuse to do anything until I can. I feel like a brat, I hate it. I have also been doing the same with brushing my teeth, right after I eat anything, even if its just a little candy, I have to brush my teeth. I don't like it if my breath doesn't smell and taste like my toothpaste. I've been brushing my teeth like 4 times a day everyday.

I haven't gone through anything traumatizing like sexual assault or abuse, so I don't think its me trying to wash something away. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder when I was 12 but that's all. I haven't gone to counseling since then. I have been feeling pretty depressed lately. I always feel grimy and dirty. I really don't know what's going on, and I'm coming on here to see if anyone can help me figure this out.

I can't drive, my friends barely reach out to talk to me, and I feel depressed and tired all the time. It physically hurts and drains me to even shower.

230,"I don't know how to cope. I'm so scared. I've been a hypochondriac my whole life. When the Ebola crisis emerged I read every news article about it, fearing the day it would arrive in my country. It got closer and closer which made me more and more anxious. I was 11 or 12 then and I would always read up on new diseases being discovered and outbreaks.

When I began to talk about covid to my family in January. I have good friends in China and remember talking to a friend about it who even brushed it off. At that point it was being called a pneumonia that wasn't known to be transmissible between humans. For another month or so I monitored the statistics every night before I slept, noting the increases. I was afraid waiting for when it would come close to me. It eventually reached my country in March. I was so nervous. Heeding words from my Chinese friends I'd stocked up on masks and sanitizer (which wasn't enough to sustain just what I could find at the time). When schools closed I was relieved. Lockdown went pretty smoothly, I did online school, made sure everything in the house was clean and that I did my best to stay well.

Roll into May and we are coming out of lockdown. I was scared but not as much. I wore my mask, sanitised and did my best to keep 2m away. School reopened in August. I did my best. Cleaned my table each time I moves classroom, wore a mask. But let's be real in a school of &gt;1000 people there wasn't 2m in the halls. In certain classes students wore masks incorrectly (over nose or chin). This gradually built up stress. I couldn't concentrate in class. Then about a week ago I had to get a tsst as i had been in close contact. I broke down when I got home after finding out, the worst I've been since about 6 months ago. I was scared for myself and other people I had been in contact to. I know many people with at risk relatives so I also felt guilt even though I couldn't have prevented it. Luckily the test came back negative but that was a turning point. I've become scared and paranoid again.

My younger brothers friend tested positive. They weren't considered close contact even though kids under 13 don't wear masks and are in a classroom together for 6 hours. A few day ago I hear my brother coughing in bed. Now he is sick with a sniffy nose, cough and tiredness. I've been so scared and telling my family to keep distance from me. They say we live together anyways.

It's gotten worse and worse. My family tell me just forget about it and I'm overly obsessed. I can't stop, I don't think about it like them. I can't stop thinking about it unless I'm asleep. The only place i feel safe is my room. My brother is acting annoyed when he comes near me and I tell him go away, he's acting offended and calls me crazy. I can't help it but my family are just treating it like I'm worried about something usual. But the difference is for the past few days if someone comes close to me or even into my room I feel like crying. I tell my brother go away and he argues with me and comes closer anyway or doesn't listen. I start giving out to him or crying and he acts like I'm at fault. He doesn't distance or wear a mask in school or as I know care about distancing from friends. Why should he feel annoyed towards me. Why are my friends and family acting like I'm the bad guy and getting annoyed when I tell them don't come near me.

It's getting worse each day. I really dont know how to cope with it. I have to add there are certain topics which I act like this for. For example covid, my appearance and body shape. No matter what people say I can't stop stressing about them. I don't know why people say to me just get over it you are young you won't get sick or you aren't ugly/fat stop acting stupidly and recklessly. I really don't know what to do. I don't know what the point of writing this was but I just want to put it out and interact with someone who can understand my point.",25Oct2020,1
231,"i am 17 years old and lately i’ve been struggling badly with my moods and i can see how it is affecting myself and how it can ruin my relationships. i’ve always been quite suicidal but now that i have a boyfriend that isn’t something that crosses my mind anymore, although i always think if he were to cheat on me or leave me i would probably do something stupid and harmful, it’s concerning that i could easily just switch and it can be dangerous and i usually do talk about suicide to my boyfriend and how even if i’m happy it’s always an option if something were to happen. i have really bad attachment issues and i’ve always been this way, i’m very clingy and will do anything to keep my boyfriend in my life, i sometimes end up making things up in my head if something seems off and then keep thinking about it until i believe something is going on, which makes him quite annoyed and stressed because i have to reassure myself by looking at who he is talking to and i just need that constant reassurance to make myself feel ok. i have been diagnosed with anxiety and am on anxiety medication which has helped with my anxiety attacks and constant anxiety throughout the day but hasn’t helped some situations which is why i’m concerned something else could be going on. i also gain a lot of jealously and anger out of no where, for example i was hanging out w my bestfriend and boyfriend and he wasn’t giving me as much attnetion as i preferred so i ended up shutting down completely, being very blunt with both of them and feeling so hurt on the inside everything was upsetting me and causing me anger i felt extremely depressed, when my bestfriend left i ended up crying for hours to my boyfriend and my bestfriend tells my other mates that my boyfriend probs wants to break up w me but is too scared to, exept my boyfriend knows me and sees i’m struggling, he has been by my side through so much for a year now, but i’m hurt because people think i’m a horrible person when i’m not. my mood swings are very intense too i feel like i feel a lot more than i should, for example i said to my boyfriend i love you and he sent hearts back then i ended up crying my eyes out, my boyfriend said he couldn’t stay for dinner i ended up shutting down cos my anger was intense then i started crying for an hour making him stay, another example is when my boyfriend said he couldn’t come see me because he was busy so i got so angry that it psychically hurt and i deleted my social media then switched to feeling like i didn’t need anyone but myself, then i downloaded it back to talk to him and was crying for a while, then my anger was the first thing i felt in the morning. i get like explosive anger for the smallest things and it’s really strange and frustrating cos i cant physically control it otherwise it hurts and makes me go insane, although i try my best not to offend anyone whej i explode. and another thing that happens is the way i feel about people switches up so much even my own friends, one day i will just feel anger/jealously toward them and then assume we’re on bad terms and then i feel happy with them again. i also get random anger toward my parents for no reason and just feel some hatred toward them but 10 mins before i felt happy with them. i don’t know it’s just so weird and hard so deal with, what could be wrong ?! it’s ruining everything, i know i am a good person but these emotions are out of my control it’s only gonna end up breaking me. i need advice",25Oct2020,1

I’ve been lower than I’ve ever been, even more so than when I found out my husband was cheating on me for three years while we had a young baby. I’m grieving my mother who died painfully 6 months ago and I’m grieving my relationship with someone I thought was the love of my life, but the relationship is making me hating myself... I feel like I’ve lost everyone. My mom just died, my brother died when I was a teenager, and my dad has a severe mental illness, so I feel so so alone in this world. Like those I loved most left me, and I’m floating in the  sea by myself, looking at all the happy islands.

I heard this song and it was like all the grief I had been feeling was brought out and I was forced to process it, and it was the most bittersweet feeling. It was significant because I’ve been feeling near suicidal and my pain has seemed pointless, which was propelling my idea that suicide was at least a reasonable option considering I didn’t ask to be put on this earth and there is immeasurable suffering here, but I don’t know, this song just triggered a small change that made me hopeful and I don’t know why. I think because it starts off saying “It’s Not The Same Anymore” so sadly and then it transitions to a happier tone as he learned to hope.

237,"Idek where to start. I grew up abused, neglected and in a very stressful environment. I left at the age of 17 because it was so toxic. 
I suffer greatly now. I never realized the impact that is caused when youre abused. I always brushed it off. ""Other people have it way worse than me, this is normal, I deserve it"" where all my excuses to myself. For years. 
I am 21 now. And I have NEVER felt so alone in my entire life. I feel like a child stuck in an adults body, that's something I have NEVER told anyone. I have done research and most of my reactions and actions and feelings are all happening because of different trauma responses. I HATE being the person who needs help.  I am usually the helper. I would NEVER want ANYONE to feel how I feel. 
But I just dont know anymore. It feels like no matter what I do I fuck it up, my boyfriend and I constantly argue because I'll try to do the simplest thing but somehow something always happens to ruin it. Most things happen due to me. Part of myself doesnt think this is true, but idk maybe it is. 
I feel like everywhere I go I'm automatically less than other people. And my brain assumes everyone perceives me as less than them too. 
I've ALWAYS felt less than EVERYONE unless they're very damaged and show it , then I feel equal to them. 
I truly dont know how to rewire my brain not to feel this way. Its EXTREMELY hard on me. 
I slouch all the time because I think over time I've accustomed myself to just curling into myself. 
I feel sooooo fucking alone holy fuck. I thought I felt alone at 12 and 21 has shown me a whole new version of loneliness. It feels like NO MATTER WHAT I DO , no matter how hard I work to fix my issues, it will NEVER be good enough.. 
I want to stop feeling this way. I journal , and that helps , but it only reminds me of how I'm stuck in my head and I'm the only one who understands me. 
I just don't get it... I wish I had more people in my life but I've pushed my parents away because I had to set boundaries, for myself. Which I do not regret. I have no friends , when people do become friends with me they ALWAYS take advantage of me. 
I try telling myself these things aren't my fault but they kinda seem to be. 
I ruin everything I touch and I have no idea how. I'm not sure at this point if it's a curse or what. 
Having a 3yr old is what keeps me alive. I couldn't do it without him and I strive to be a better parent to him than mine were to me. 
Everytime my bf and I argue, he ALWAYS brings up my mistakes and wrongdoings. 
I always take everything personally so it feels like I'm always being attacked anyway. I really dont know how to get support or help.  I could never afford it. Pills are off the table as I live naturally and dont agree with the phamarceutial industries. 
Does ANYONE (if you've read this far) have ANYYYYY ideas as to how I can get help? Or even how I can feel less alone for that matter. Honestly anything would help. Thank you if youve read this far and I appreciate it and I'm sorry if it makes no sense.. my mind is so cluttered rn.. 😔",25Oct2020,1
238,"As the title states.


I severed one of my fingers almost entirely at the last joint with an electric saw while I was doing some woodworking, the blade completely went though all but the skin on the opposite side of the finger. It was a planned and intentional act. I did feel heavily compelled to do it after obsessing about doing it for a day or two, but I was not acutely psychotic at the time nor was I having command hallucinations to do so.


I had surgery to more or less replant the severed section and it went pretty well. In the following weeks I intentionally sabotaged the healing process. Zip ties around the base of the finger to cut off circulation which were left there for eight-ten hours or as long as I could stand it, I shoved dirt into the wound, poked dirt covered toothpicks into it to try and get it infected. Nothing worked so eventually I held the re-implanted portion to dry ice for a few hours and presented to the ER with an infection and said I had a fever the night before. At no point in speaking to medical professionals so far have I been truthful about the cause of the original injury or the subsequent “infection.”


I had an amputation done the following week and stayed in the hospital on IV antibiotics for another week. Was discharged and went back to life as usual. 


Not really sure what the point of this post is. I’m not sure why I did it. I know what BIID is, and I don’t have it. No long-standing feeling that the finger wasn’t my own or didn’t belong, no attempts to pretend to be an amputee, etc. I just felt heavily compelled to do it, so I did it, without really considering short or long term consequences or how painful it would be. Turns out it isn’t that painful, believe it or not.


In the past I have had some fairy serious mental health issues and I’ve been diagnosed as Schizoaffective, which I have chosen to leave untreated completely for the past few years, mainly because the medication made me feel like fucking shit. I do still experience hallucinations, (mainly auditory) delusions, severe paranoia, delusional thinking, and depressive episodes associated with the disorder, but I don’t remember my symptoms being particularly severe at either time that I did what I did, (they tend to wax and wane a lot, I find I can manage quite well without treatment... kinda) and I definitely wasn’t acutely psychotic as I have vivid and specific memories about what I was doing at the time, and I was very aware of what I was doing. What was absent from my thought process was any self awareness for how crazy the actions that I was taking were. I fully recognize that this is a strange thing to do, although I don’t regret it.


Not sure what the point of this post is, really. Just venting, I guess. I haven’t had any issues with my physical functionality missing the whole finger, grip strength and hand function is adequate for my job, it just looks a little funky but I barely notice how it looks anymore.


What should probably be slightly worrying to me, but is not, is that I would very much like to mutilate myself again. I have made some specific plans as to how I’d do it, but I decide against it every time as I don’t want to miss so work again (physically active job) and it would just look SO suspicious if something major happened again the same year. I think about cutting off more fingers, enucleating myself, seriously mutilating my face to the point of permanent disfigurement, cutting off my ears, nose, toes, etc.


Kinda wacky stuff, right? I’ve thought about seeing my old therapist and telling her all this, but I would probably be involuntarily hospitalized which just isn’t an option for me right now or ever as far as I’m concerned.


I have no real emotions about the action or its consequences beyond what I faked to have at the time in order to not seem suspicious, and it really doesn’t bother me having a fucked up hand. I joke about it a lot and do think it looks pretty funny. Usually I go with the classic “I just have to whip my pecker out to count to ten now.” It gets mixed reactions, mostly positive.


I’m more than comfortable answering whatever questions you guys might have about this. Truth be told I like talking about it, and it’s sort of eating at me not to be able to tell people about it. Not because I feel guilty but because it’s just so bizarre and peculiar. Probably pretty uncommon.",25Oct2020,1

I don’t know if this is the right sub.  I’m doing relatively okay but somethings been  going on but idk if I should be worried. I’ve noticed a pattern that every time I take something that I think that alters my mental state I start to freak out. It didn’t happen with alcohol but it happened the first time I smoked weed. I felt like I was panicking, and I was obviously high but I would get so scared that I would go to the E.R, or that I wouldn’t be where I’m at, or worse that I might pass. I think the E.R is the fact that I did black out and ended up there once when I drank. It was scary but I got over it. Over the summer I got a medical procedure and I think I started freaking out again. Last night I went out with friends and I barely had two sips and It happened. The common thing that happens is that in my mind I feel okay, like it’s not me fully when I’m in my normal state but I’m aware of what’s going on. However, my thoughts are often racing and I start overthinking. If I see something happening that doesn’t make sense I wonder if it’s happening to me or I’m scared that I’m not really where I am and wonder if something bad is gonna happen. When I noticed it happening I tend to move away from the situation and just sit or sleep somewhere because I’m scared that I’m not safe.  Idk if this example helps, but I barely had anything to drink but I was on the couch and my friends were drunk and doing drunk things lol. But for me I was on the couch and I knew where I was and my mind was okay (i barely took anything) but I was sitting there and my friends was vomiting and crying and the one thought that kept on popping up was “what if this is happening to me “ “what if I’m the one crying or vomiting” “what if I’m not really where I’m at” or what if “something happened and I’m gonna end up in the hospital “ and sometimes I just feel like the stuff they are doing is just happening to me or just like they are saying what I’m thinking. My mind knows that’s not the case but it freaks me out and I guess it happens everytime I’m in near a substance that alters my mind. And I constantly ask those around to make sure I’m okay because I really want to make sure I’m safe and others around me are. At first, it was scary and my heart was racing but I’ve been meditating and I did see a counselor so I don’t freak out freak out when it happens but it’s kinda annoying and I’m just wanna make sure i’m okay.",25Oct2020,1

I just really need some support right now, I don’t want to hurt my family/friends but suicide seems like the best idea I’ve ever had, I want to die so bad.",25Oct2020,1
244,"TW: Inpatient 















But I literally hate my life. About a week ago I tried to walked into traffic and a threatened to set the leasing office of my apartment on fire. Of course I got sent to inpatient after being in the ER for 12 hours. I was pissed that my boyfriend had ditched me AND called the police on me too. And I decided this time at inpatient I was going to be a b**** and just stay in my room the whole time but it didn’t turn out that way. I met the coolest group of people ever. They were so fun. And we had so much fun. Making up inside jokes and staying up as late as they would possibly let us. Man, I couldn’t believe myself. But I didn’t WANT to go home. Back to my mother’s house. I didn’t want to hear my daughter scream at me, I didn’t want to deal with my boyfriend telling me why he didn’t want to live with me. I just wanted it to be us, shooting the s*** and going to group. But instead I’m but at my mother’s dealing with all the bull, and I’m over it already. I mean, by no means am I going to walk into traffic. But I feel a bit silly wishing I was still in inpatient. I feel sick actually. I wish I missed everybody. But I didn’t cause they were all so rude to me when I was out. And I honestly can’t stand them. We had a family meeting while I was in there and it went well but I just put on a front for the therapist so she wouldn’t think I was nuts. I honestly feel terrible for hating my family cause I’m suppose to love them, I’m mad at myself for loving these random strangers more than my family. I’m tearing up as I write this actually and I wonder what is my problem actually is.",25Oct2020,1
245,"Ok
Few months later I thought my life will be a disaster
Because of my problems. 
And I started to stop strange shit on the internet (gore vid, strange p*rn, ect) 
I felt better, I felt like my life was going to be a good life. 
But 2 days ago
I did it again, I opened a gore website and spent hours at watching people getting tortured. 
Now that I know basics on the internet security
I go on tor to find everything that my brain think about. 
I discovered a lot of strange things that makes me happy
But it can makes everyone else vomit. 

In society I am a pretty cool guy 
I have a lot of friends, I am dating a beautiful girl,I have money, I make laugh everyone with my jokes. 
But when I'm alone with myself I am totally different. 
I tried necr******* and pe** (i did it on my pc not irl) and the most disgusting thing is that I liked it. 

I mentally destroyed my dad witch is a crazy bastard
My mom turned into a sort of slave 
And my whole family always seen me as a ""strange kid""

I feel like my happiness is an illusion that my brain create to not face the reality.

I don’t know what to do honestly I still enjoy hanging with my buddies and going to the gym but other than that I always tell me self I need to do this or that to work to improve myself but I can never bring myself to do it for whatever reason if anyone has some tips or advice for me it would be greatly appreciated my family does have a history or mental illnesses but I do not think I’m to the point where I need to see a medical professional I just need a plan.

I have been diagnosed with BPD and bipolar disorder. My psychiatrist told me that she doesn’t think u have ADHD, just anxiety. I don’t want to self diagnose but I have a lot of trouble concentrating and sitting still so I’m not really sure how that would be because of anxiety. I want to talk to her about it, but I don’t know how to say it in a way where I seem like I’m being forceful. It’s not like I want to have ADHD, I don’t know if a diagnosis would really do anything, I’m too underweight to be able to take any kind of stimulant. Maybe it would just be validating you hear that I’m not stupid and lazy. Not being able to focus really negatively effects my life. What should I do?",25Oct2020,1

Ever since quarantine started and I had to start classes online my brain just has felt like it wasn’t working right. I completed my spring semester classes with some hiccups but they went by and I was ready for my summer break. Summer goes by uneventful. 

Fall semester rolls around and I’m excited to be back on campus, see my friends and teammates I haven’t seen since March and get back into the swing of being a student athlete.

These past two months looking back have been dreadful. I am behind in most of my classes, my sports have been well but that’s why I am an athlete. I’ve had great times with my friends and even with COVID restrictions we make time to see each other because we know this isn’t easy going through quarantine alone.

I’m just so confused with what’s happening inside my head, I know saying “I shouldn’t feel like this” is not right but I am a multi time All American, I do well in school normally, I have great friends and I have a loving family. 

I am scheduling an appointment with my schools  counseling services, this is a step in the right direction for me.

I just don’t understand why I feel the way I do.

The extreme emotional responses, like hours of crying, that results when those people have decided to leave is also very difficult for me to cope up with and this concerns my friends a lot.

I can't stop thinking about it and thinking about if there was any way for me to help, but no matter what I just feel so fucking helpless. I have had anger issues and depression before his death but ever since then it's become wayyy worse. A day doesn't go by without me getting pissed of by something so small and insignificant but i get so filled with rage that I just want to punch something or someone. I cry every night and I can't fall asleep. Some nights I fall asleep around 5am and wake up at around 9-10am. I can't do this shit anymore. It's taking tolls on my mental health, my friendships and my physical health. 
Recently I started to hear shit and I have started to get so worked up and filled with rage that I just wanna smash someone's head in the fucking concrete.
I don't want to hurt anyone and I'm getting professional help (psychiatrist) but I'm just so fucking worked up from everything that I just can't hold it in anymore. 
I can't bottle up all of this shit anymore. I feel so fucking deppresed, lonely, angry, anxious and extremely fucking tired! I don't know what to do anymore. I've tried getting hobbies but everything has become so unbelievably boring, I've tried focusing on school but that's just makes me incredibly anxious and exhausted.

I feel like this has grown further affecting everything else in my life, even non-romantic relationships. I don't trust anyone, and I feel as if everyone is trying to get me, because that's what human survival is at the end the day: Having the advantage, right?

I felt like I tried everything: Working out (I'm an athlete), journaling, therapy, medicine, and meditating. I guess quarantine is getting to me, too, but I don't want to make that an excuse because I've almost went to a ward before quarantine. I was severely depressed and I didn't have any idea if I would live the next day or not. Having these spikes of anxiety reminds me of that state, and I don't succumb to it, but it seems so much easier to do that.

266,"I've been living back home with my parents ever since March. In the past 9 months, my mental health has deteriorated so much, I'm scared I'll be left with these intrusive thoughts forever. Being home surrounded by just my family is not the most supportive environment. A lot of my independence and control over my life has been taken away and it's been frustrating. I wanted to move back to my college apartment in September, but my father(who financially supports me) didn't think it would be a good idea considering COVID. So it feels like I'm stuck in this endless cycle of never being satisfied with my life at the current moment. I haven't seen any of my friends since March.

I just started my third year of college as a biochem major, with hopes of going to medical school one day. But my GPA isn't great, and I feel like my resume is lacking. In the past 3 months, I've gotten in the bad habit of comparing myself to people. I used to never do this. But nowadays this is all I find myself doing??? ""Oh, she's so much smarter than me"" ""How come they're able to handle so much and I can't"". Just constant comparison. And this is affected my motivation with my classes. I feel so dumb and have the looming feeling I'll never amount to anything in life. And being back home is making it even worse. I feel isolated in my room, and I really struggle to study by myself. I deleted my social media to try and get out of the cycle, but I still find myself comparing to people I don't even know. It just feels like a vicious cycle and I don't know how to get out of it.

She would even try to give me a reward if I do do it and I still can’t despite me describing myself as a very reward driven person.I don’t want to do anything I’m just always so sad and angry and I can’t understand why. School hasn’t helped this, I’ve forced myself to do the work when school wasn’t online but now that it is I can’t get anything done despite me already wasting all my time behind a screen. I’m in danger of failing four classes two of them being electives, and don’t let me forget to mention those electives are things I use as escapism which are art and chorus (singing). I want to do the work but whenever I get close to doing it I sit there staring at the screen swiftly losing my motivation. My mom has started yelling at me because I can’t get my work done and I can’t say anything except I just don’t want to do it and she tells me we all have to do things we don’t want to, and I can’t find a rebuttal. She threatens to take my door off, take away the WiFi, take away my tv and nothing works. I’ve tried forcing myself to do the work but one I get to it I completely stop. I can’t even do stuff I want to do, as stated earlier I’m an artist and I’ve tried created stories but each time I get to the point of writing I stop, forget about it, then go to work and another one, the cycle repeats.

He has broken almost everything in my house threatened my mom verbally abuse both of us and he doesn’t understand people at all. He thinks that every problem in the world can be fixed with a strong mind but it ain’t that easy. He doesn’t believe that he’s a bad person, in fact he thinks he’s the most innocent man in the world but he’s a narcissist with a god complex that can’t take care of his own child ( my baby sister) and blames my mother every time something bad happens while he watches her, and I hate him so goddamn much but we can’t rid of him because he’s the only person in the house with a job therefor he’s the only one who can pay the bills. The only things that make me happy anymore is drawing, playing games, and talking with my friends and at this point even those annoy me! I have two friends who I talk with almost daily for 2 months and one of them makes me so mad, he always makes fun of me, he can never understand that he’s being annoying or hurtful and when I tell him he just makes a joke and then goes back to his same old bullshit. Video games makes me mad because no matter what I do I can’t be good at them, it doesn’t matter if I’ve been playing it for years or have 500+ hours in it there’s always someone better and it makes me lose any and all motivation the same with drawing there’s always gonna be somebody better and I understand that when I start but once I see them and know I can barely do anything to be better than them or atleast equal level I lose all motivation.
