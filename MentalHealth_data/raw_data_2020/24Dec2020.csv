2,"So I was feeling absolutely out of my mind the passed week or two when a new doctor sent me home w medicine I was already taking but w an increase from 350 to 450mg 
Just being very irritable and stressed for seemingly no real reason 
So I stopped taking it about 3 days ago now and I'm thinking I should get back on it but I'm just scared and unsure 
Without it I'm terrified of everything and my mind just goes goes goes but with it I was cranky and stressed and sleepy 
I feel horrible because I've been telling my significant other I've been taking it the last 3 days (we help each other keep track) when I havent been 
I decided I was too scared to mention it to anyone and came here I guess I'm just asking if itd be ill advised to take it again now or not 
I'll make an appointment soon for the doctor but I've been struggling with mental health as long as I can remember and I'm just terrified it's not going to get better when several different doctors and types of medications havent helped much up to this point as it's been getting worse recently 
I wish I could say this stuff my so they're just also struggling and I dont want them to be brought down by things I'm worried about plus their own medicine",24Dec2020,1

4,"Hi, My names Tyler and I’m 18 years old. I’m gonna start from the beginning also on mobile so excuse me if I have miss types also I have pour spelling. (Not terrible though)

To start off I was born in a nice sized town on the east coast of the United States ( State being Maryland) my father fell in love with my mother and had me and my brother who is a year younger my dad has money he worked hard from 16 to now still working hard, my mom well she was a wonderful person until I hit about 6 years old randomly one day we left not my brother just me and her, to a run down city in the same state turns out while in college she picked up a drug addiction and cheated on my father. Here’s where the story goes kinda dark.

Fast forward a year I grew up in a black community me being white things weren’t easy my school of 600 students I was 1 of maybe 15 whites about 200 Spanish/latino rest being of black origin I had to fight a lot at a young age but the community accepted me and my mom fairly quick, I missed a lot of school and honestly for the next 5 years I was on a downwards path I started drinking and smoking weed at 12 by 14 I was into Xanax and lean, my mother met a ms-13 member for those who don’t know what that is. It’s a very large and dangerous group of people who live by there guns and money. I’m now 14 I was arrested and charged with felony gun possession charges and assault with a deadly weapon.

Luckily for me the felony was downsized to a mista meaner and I only served 6 months and was released on house arrest. My life hit bottom here. Once off house arrest (only 3 months with 3 years of probation) I went on a drug sex fueled rage. Fighting and I had more money then I knew what to do with. I grew up fast. By 16 I was taking care of my mom and the whole house. I never knew family love because my step dad was a homie his friends where homies I had rules I had a back to watch and I was protecting myself. A lot of gruisum things happened as I was young that I don’t feel comfortable mentioning. But I’ll say this I still have nightmares. But here I am now. My birthday is in January by spring I was on my own and I moved away. To the town my father lived.

Start of my new school was major. I walked in. No blacks. No Latino. All white rednecks. Now remind you I walked in wearing vans knee socks shorts a black shirt my other attire included skinny jeans and Jordan’s and just stuff I didn’t see anyone wearing. I lived in a run down apartment on what is known as the bunker. Worst part of the town.  not even my father knew I was here or close. Now to where my life betters. Girls where all over me and I’m not gonna lie I had fun. But my drug use was at a high and I was consuming more alcohol then food. I’m in very good shape still somehow never figured out how or why though. But I was arrested a few times and after a month everyone knew my name.

One day in school I exploded. Everyone in my class the fear they saw haunts me still. Except one girl. She stood walked up to me and hugged me. I was moments away from hitting my teacher when she did this. She was beautiful the way she smelled, her eyes. Me being a stubborn prick I pushed her off me. But later that night I was home when I heard a knock on my front door and I opened it to see her standing there. She grew up on the rich side money flowed through her family like it grew on trees. And she told me after I blew up and left the class she was assigned to be my project partner. That night we started. Now I’m pretty illiterate and I couldn’t read until a few months ago. I was sitting at a kitchen table with armed men and she sat across from me with no fear, just a smile, the next day we worked on it at her house, it was massive, her parents welcomed me with open arms, and this was the start of my new life. 

I’m gonna leave it off here I’m tired of typing, but if you guys wanna hear me of my just kinda crazy life or have questions feel free to say so! Also the point of all this is, I wanna write a book on my life. And tell everything I’ve held in me for a long time..",24Dec2020,1
5,"hi, idk if this is the right place to post this kinda thing or not, if so let me know and i’ll delete. before i begin, my current diagnoses are bipolar 2, adhd, and anxiety. i was wondering if it’s a symptom or just normal to have an obsessive fixation on a person? like not in a romantic way, but just constantly striving for their approval, checking to see if they’ve opened texts and especially anxious for their response, etc.. this person is someone i work with as well as friend and for privacy i’m not gonna say much more, they’re older than me too. but i always have at least one person i’m especially fixated on or worried about. when i stop worrying about that person someone else comes along and it becomes them. is this normal at all??",24Dec2020,1
6,"My entire life I’ve always dreamed big and had plans for myself. I always got so worked up about my ideas and my visions and every time I would tell someone, they’d completely shoot It down and tell me I’m stupid for thinking I could do It. “You can’t do that.” “You’re being unrealistic” “That’s way out of your league” “wow you’re seriously crazy or just delusional”. After so long of hearing that, I constantly go back and forth with the emotions. 1) are those people right? Am I really crazy and being unrealistic? Or 2) FUCK THOSE PEOPLE. I can do this. I’m an amazing person and if I set my mind to It I can accomplish this. 

It just hurts hearing negative things your whole life because It makes you doubt yourself. I just wanna hear one time, “I believe in you”. Or a simple question of “oh well what are your ideas?” I mean come on, AT LEAST seem intrigued and see I’m passionate about something. Do people really just not care about other peoples visions and dreams? I always get so excited for friends and family when they express their dreams to me, but when It comes to mine? HA, let’s get everyone around and just laugh at the jokester. 

I’m just so over people.",24Dec2020,1
7,"It is normal for me to keep my demons to myself? I do not like talking to people I know about my personal problems or issues, mainly due to the fact I’m scared they might look at me differently, and I’m scared they might think I’m just doing this for attention when I’m clearly not. I need some advice on this, I do not feel normal these couple of months especially with everything happening I find myself having mood swings and weird urges that I can’t help myself doing, and also extreme paranoia I always suspect something that is very irrational just to name a few things if anyone can help me on what to do I’d like the help thanks.",24Dec2020,1
8,"I  was really pissed off by something I heard someone say yesterday. I am  normally the type of person who, when angry at you, will come right at  you and have an argument / fight right then, because I don't like  unresolved conflict. Sometimes it doesn't take a lot to set me off, and  it doesn't help that once I build steam I often find it pretty hard to  reign myself in. That's not something I'm proud of; just a fact of my  life that I am trying to work on.

Instead  of going right at this person yesterday, which likely would have turned  into a screaming match with me hurling out anything that came to mind  in an attempt to hurt the other person while seeing red in the heat of  the moment, I walked away and asked myself which scenario I wanted more;  which would be more productive  - to hurt this person or make them  understand my point of view. So I didn't try to resolve it right then. I  slept on it, and I came to them this morning to tell them my feelings.

I,  without yelling, told them to either say whatever they had to say to my  face or wait until I'm out of earshot to say it. To respect me in my  house, and follow the rules I've set out, at the very least. That I  think that's a reasonable position. The other person tried to get heated  with me and yelled a little bit, and I got pretty angry at that, but I  controlled myself and didn't yell back. I just waited for them to be  done and said that's fine, but it doesn't change the conversation we're  having right now. That there will be respect given on both sides, or the  conversation will be over and we can do it that way instead.

Well  it worked, and the other person calmed down and we had a good  discussion about why we were both upset and what we can do to resolve it  better in the future.

Nothing  major, just wanted to tell this to someone since I was proud of myself  for not losing my temper and I got to see how it can turn out if you  don't do that.",24Dec2020,1
9,"Hey, so, not sure if this is the right place, but I guess I'll find out. (CW: suicide, self harm)

I'm not really good at talking about how I feel - like, I rarely know the right words to express how I feel and I don't really know how to express feelings in general and whenever I try talking about my feelings it kind of ends up as some weird joke. I mean, it sounds worse when I write it like that, but it's just been like that in my family growing up, I guess.

Anyway. The problem arises that I sometimes really need help and I don't know how to ask for it. I usually make something up or try to describe physical symptoms, but that usually makes my physician tell me I feel that way because of ""sudden changes in my life"" (I moved, started college a year ago, then Covid happened, I mean, at this point in 2020, what doesn't qualify as a sudden change in life?) and prescribe me a pack of ibuprofen.

One and a half years ago I tried to commit suicide. Nobody really noticed and I went to a different physician a few days afterwards saying I couldn't get out of bed, was feeling nausenauseous and having headaches. The physician told me that ""nowadays everyone's depressed or burned out, what do you want?"" and I  asked him to write me an excuse letter for being absent from school for a few days. He refused, so that was fun.

I guess I'm currently seeing a mental health counceller at my university with the excuse that I'm not getting anything done in my courses. We're currently at the stage where he slowly realizes that telling me to try making an organized weekly plan is probably not a solution for my inability to get out of bed. He said something really upsetting recently and I just sat there and couldn't really get anything out until I got out and broke down crying. That ended up being the first time in over a year that I cut myself - on the upside I got incredibly productive for two days afterwards just to spite him. The next time I saw him, we got back to making weekly productivity plans.

Huh, it's the first time I'm listing those situations like this and I really gotta learn how to talk about that stuff. 

Yeah, I guess I kind of want to know how others do it? Like, I am aware that it's probably very different for every person but maybe you still have some advice?

Thanks for reading and have a great holiday season despite these unfortunate times.",24Dec2020,1
10,"Hello, so basically I'm not sure if it's all due to me having PCOS which makes my hormones wacky or just how I actually feel. I want a nice organized life and stuff but ended up moving in with my bf and his mom into their apartment. I didnt have much of a choice cause it was this or be homeless. I dont do well confined to small spaces personally. The ceiling are low and all the walls are literally white...which I find drives me a bit crazy over time. Not to mention.....they have e stains since him and his mom have lived here for 14 years and  nothing has been updated or repainted. His mom...is semi a hoarder of weird stuff and tends to make messes. We both agreed once the lease is up in march she either move out or we do. But, that's months from now and I'm not sure how I can cope with living here honestly. I currently cant get a job since I had surgery recently and in a week or so will be starting some hormone pills and such and dont know the side effects yet. So...I'm confined to this apartment. It's in a bad area so walking around isnt...really safe plus walking currently increases my pain a ton from the surgery. I tried cleaning this place a few times already and moved stuff around. But no matter what i do it seems not to make a damn dent in the clutter and horrible look of everything. I dont even have all my stuff here and i was considering bringing my tv and computer and desk but...literally no place to put it. All this stuff is hers so if she moves out then i am free to have plenty space and decorate how i want. But for now...idk any thoughts on how to cope till march?",24Dec2020,1
11,"I'm a teenager who can't drive yet. I don't know where it came from, but over the past 4-5 years, I've just felt worse and worse emotionally for no reason.

When I was 11 i tried to talk with my parents about it, and I basically got ""No❤"" as an answer. I never tried again, I kept it to myself and it got worse(who could've guessed)

15,"I'm in my late 20s and have had major depression for over a decade. My life experiences during this time were mostly trying to keep a roof over my head, losing faith in everything, and stagnating in every meaningful way. I was in denial about my condition for a long time and used to have ambitious dreams. Pushing myself to achieve them and using substances to keep going has lead to breakdowns and left my cognitive abilities in shambles. I can barely remember anything from the last ten years. Approaching my thirties, starting to see the damage done and the rest of my life shaping up to be a path of coping and compromise. No happy memories to show for it, just a pointless ordeal full of mistakes. Any tips on dealing with that kind of regret?",24Dec2020,1

17,"It’s always “how can you help me?” and not “how can I help you?”. Why do I always have to help people but no one even cares about my well-being. I’ve been struggling with depression since 2018 and to this day, nobody has taken me seriously. Everyone always says I have nothing to be “sad” about and that there are people in worse situations than me. Just because I am in a better situation than someone else, doesn’t mean my feelings should be invalidated. Then my parents always tell me to pray about it and I have been for years. But it’s still hard too because religious trauma is one of the main sources of my problems. I feel alone. I haven’t talked to anyone but family in almost a year. And even my family makes me feel like shit. I can’t catch a break. I even relapsed today and i’m pissed because I was 26 days clean from self harm. I have thought about suicide daily for the past month and every day I feel closer to just giving up. Everyday I just take a bunch of sleeping pills so I can sleep the entire day and not deal with anyone or anything. It just seems so much easier. I want friends. Someone to make me laugh and actually make me feel heard. I can’t even remember the last time I was genuinely happy or interested in anything. I just felt like venting since i’m pretty tired of talking to myself all the time.",24Dec2020,1
18,"I(19)'m writing this to try and express what's going on, and to see if this is something everyone feels, if so, how anyone deals with it, and if not, if anyone has a solution, because it feels like I've hit a dead end and I'm just going to be stuck like this until I die. Sorry it's long, and I've definitely used ""empty"" and ""bored"" way too much.

This is going to sound like bullshit but it's the closest to how I can verbally express?? how things are to me: I feel like at some point I stopped seeing and hearing and feeling things, and then eventually I stopped trying to look and listen. Everything is just dull and static, and really empty. 

And usually I just deal with that. A lot of days I have nothing to do, but then that catches up with me and reminds me that I'm wasting my life, and that I'm *really really bored*. And I shut down completely and I'm dying to do *anything at all* but nothing feels physically possible. It all seems draining and unrewarding and frustrating. 

Genuine question, what's the point? I dealt with the existential aspect of that a while back. I have no set purpose on this planet, no specific reason to have been born, and given I have no goal or dream, I've accepted that and worked on making life worth it. My very simple solution to that was to just do things that make me happy and get this all over with. But the problem is nothing makes me happy, notably because I don't?? feel happiness. 

I can't draw or write anymore, either for lack of inspiration, or for lack of energy, and when I do it lasts a day, and is therefore even more disappointing and frustrating when it's gone so fast. In the last 5 years of my life I've managed to read 3 books. I don't *feel I belong* with people, there's a connection missing, a tiny *something* that makes every interaction feel just a little bit off. It's cliché I guess but I genuinely can't remember what it feels like to laugh. I have so few fulfilling, or interesting, or meaningful conversations with most people. Nothing is stimulating at all. Everything's numb. I can't figure out the point in doing anything. I'm not even struggling or sad or anything, just so empty.  

I'm stuck. I'm not managing to find a solution because logically speaking, I'm at a dead end: how the fuck am I supposed to feel happy if I can never physically do what I loved doing? If speaking with other people can't fill the emptiness that that creates? If I generally don't feel anything? 

I'm so fucking bored, and I've been bored for as long as I can remember, and it's unbearable and I don't know what to do to change that. I'm not managing to accurately express what's going on in my head. There's no point in anything, literally speaking, and I can't end things because I know people care about me. I'm just drained and empty and clueless.",24Dec2020,1
19,"I told myself I wouldn't make it to 16. Then 18. Then 20. Then 21. I'm going to turn 22 in February which is mind-blowing to me because I first attempted suicide in 2014 when I was 15. This year alone, I've had 5 attempts, so in my lifetime, I've easily attempted near 20 times. 

Because I thought I would be dead by 16, I didn't exactly plan for 22. But nothings changed, except I graduated (but no ceremony because of COVID which makes it feel very underwhelming). I still live at home, I still self harm and I suffer with BDD and issues like that. I feel very ... lost. I keep feeling like I'm letting everyone I know down because I can't get a job in my industry field and I just lost my Christmas retail job because of Tier 4 lockdown restrictions in the UK. 

I was on medication for the first 3 months of the year and came off them because they made me super sick. 

I feel really unhappy with pretty much every aspect of my life, relationship, friends, family and work. LIke, I'm just wasting my time existing. I don't get out of bed or out of my PJs, I spend hours endlessly on Sims or Animal Crosisng because they feel like the most stimulating thing to me right now. I feel so low, I can barely bring myself to go downstairs because it means making it up the stairs again. 

I've been self harming since I was 12. My legs are covered. My arms in tatters, I have the ones on my left arm covered with a tattoo but I just self harm on the front of my arm instead. I have had anxiety for as long as I can remember.

It has taken a while to write this up and post this here. but here I am hoping for a little advice. I guess I sort of reached a new low, just asking strangers on the internet instead of asking for real help. Kind of pathetic isn’t it? I don’t know why I find that humorous, anyway…

Hey, so I am not the best at admitting to others my… ‘problems’, so why not hide behind a message board? Basically, I'm hoping for advice. you see whenever I have nothing to do, I start to... think. think about my future. Think about never having a good job, no wife, maybe I’ll die a virgin or kiss a girl. and as cliché as it may be. I also think about the inevitability of death. because after being raised a Christian my whole life. I had a… ‘break down’ (of self-harm) three years ago, resulting in me having a sort of falling out with god. so... I never really came to terms with the idea of death being forever. and well I’m not sure if I believe in god, I’m in the grey zone of faith. anyway, sometimes I think about hurting myself… I don’t… but I’m worried I will. I blame it on having such a good life that I just want a bad day to be normal. However, I’m starting to think this may be a sort of unhealthy masochism. And all these bad thoughts bombarding my head is just too much and I don’t know what to do other than ask for help which I don’t think I can do yet… mainly because first I will have to admit it to someone. meaning I will need a friend to tell it to, which I’m working on. But for now, I was wondering if there is a good way to distract myself. it is probably worth mentioning that I use escapism whenever I can... but eventually I run out of things to distract myself with and the thoughts come back, in summary, I need a new way to distract myself for now at least.",24Dec2020,1

25,"So for context I (22F) have multiple disabilities, one of them being a variety of eye conditions. I had a cataract as a baby which left one of my corneas cloudy looking and I have two different coloured eyes. Then at 14 I had glaucoma which meant I got a transplant in the same eye due to eye pressures.

I’ve always been self conscious about my appearance and at my worst I feel like the ugliest person I know. I was bullied in high school for my appearance and knew I was the unattractive one out of my siblings.

So earlier today I was at the opticians and they mentioned the option for cosmetic surgery, since I’m now an adult. They can make my cloudy eye look clear and make my eyes symmetrical. I could even get the both the same colour if I wanted to. Of course he was just mentioning it and I didn’t have to make a decision, but it’s interesting to think about.

On the one hand I like the idea of looking “less disabled” in a way (couldn’t word that better) and I feel like looking more normal will improve my quality of life. It could improve my self confidence and make me love myself more. But on the other hand getting it done could be seen as me listening to those negative thoughts and letting everyone who bullied me win. I want to make sure if I do this, I’m doing it to improve my life and not because I think I look disgusting. 

I have plenty of time to think about this but what are things I should think about?",24Dec2020,1
26,"Hello,

I am female and in my early twenties. And I have been suffering from Depression and Anxiety since I was thirteen. And when I was thirteen I had an history of self harm and during that time I was going through depression. And because of that I was taken out of public school because it was recommended that would be best for me. So fast forwarded I was finishing up middle school online and I met up with guidance counselor from the online school who knew my history. And she wanted to catch up basically to see if I was going to continue to do homeschool in high school with them. And at that time I was like no because at that time I wanted to have a normal high school experience. But knowing my history she said she would recommend me to stay in public school but me being me I was stubborn and choose to go to public school. And boy I regret that decision everyday of my life because high school was very terrible for me. I was bullied and mocked everyday at school. But I was constantly told I needed to fight back or tell a teacher. And at that time I was timid person afraid to even tell on somebody because I didn’t want retaliation from anybody. I remember one time two seniors would make sexual comments towards me and everyday people would say I smelled which made not want anybody next to me. And I’m not exaggerating when I said everyday people would mock me and make me feel like shit. It was literally everyday and I have thought about killing myself plenty of times but I was too much of a coward to do it. I was in public high school for 3 years. And during those three years my mental health just went down hill from there and my self esteem just vanished. But again constantly I was told to suck it up. I

Anyways I’m saying this now because now my family members are saying that I should tried harder in high school. And that homeschool wasn’t the best option and it gave me a false reality. And me being homeschool is the reason why I’m not successful and basically emotionally damaged. Should I have tried harder because maybe I would have been successful.",24Dec2020,1

But for now, I was wondering if there is a good way to distract myself. it is probably worth mentioning that I use escapism whenever I can... but eventually, I run out of things to distract myself with and the thoughts come back, in summary, I don't know what to anymore... all I know is I need a new way to stop these thoughts",24Dec2020,1
28,"For me, reducing stress, anxiety, and depression during this holiday season is about eliminating negative/toxic influences and replacing them with positive and healthy ones. It also helps by staying present within awareness and being grateful for all that I have... without comparing what I had or what I did to celebrate the holidays last year - this is vital to ensuring my peace and joy through the season and beyond. 

For instance, I can't travel to be with my family this year so I will do a Zoom call... which is lame and depressing in comparison. So to help make it interesting I'll make the Zoom call more fun by playing games with my fam, (jackbox, quiplash, etc.) and putting the screen on my family room tv so I feel like they're with me instead of on my cell phone screen. It's not about which is better, being with them in person or on a webinar, but making the most of my circumstance and adapting... finding the light so to speak and residing within the positivity of that adaptation... and going one step further and being grateful for it! Many people will not even have the opportunity to have a zoom call with their family, I will. This is a BLESSING. 

Anywho, I just released a new video on YT sharing ten tips to help us all make the most of this holiday season. These tips will also help us just feel better by eliminating some stress and anxiety and help decrease the loneliness and  depression. I'm wishing you all a very peaceful and joyous holiday season!

29,"idk if she’s just being delusional, if she’s mistaken, or if it’s true. I’m really freaked out anyway. She specifically said it was findmyfriends and he was tracking me + 3ish friends. 

The specificity worries me, because me and my friends do use that app (to meet up with each other, make sure people get home safe), and I have 5 friends listed. I have no idea how my Dad would have access though, because I never shared with him. Also how would he be able to see my friends? Mom mentioned something like maybe I signed into my email on his phone and that’s how he got access?

Does this sound like a delusion? Does anyone have any advice: like if I change my password, would it sign me out on his app/phone? I plan on looking on my Dad’s phone tonight to see if I can find anything like she mentioned, however Mom says he deleted the app when she found it.",24Dec2020,1

33,"Can I whisper you a secret?

Did you know when you are imagining something (like playing hockey) and when you're actually doing something (like actually playing hockey) your mind goes through the exact same processes? So, neurologically, doing something and imagining something are the same thing.

So, PLEASE. PLEASE. Imagine your self as who you want to be. Imagine yourself as confident or happy or successful or adventurous or book smart or independent or any wonderful thing you want to be. Because even if you hold a different mindset for 15 seconds, your neural pathways start to adapt to that new state.

Once your inner world changes, you actively seek out the outer world that reflects those changes.

You are yourself imagined.

35,"I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for the past 4 years (18M).

I'm feeling weird about myself because it's a never-ending cycle. Hits whenever it likes. Sometimes I'm super good, sometimes super bad.

I started noticing it a year ago when I kind of tracked how my moods are going and realized that every day was bland/dull with no mood at all (more sad ish tho) and then I either get super happy and enthusiastic, get a big energy boost and motivation doing stuff I need/""want"" or I get super sad when I can't do basically anything. I woke up dull, for no reason at all get sad. I just lie in my bed listening to sad music and browsing social media feeds for hours, nap, and be drowsy all the god damn time. Those cycles I would say were accurate as swiss watches. One mood per day but at least I knew was gonna happen. 

A few months later something changed. No goods moods, only big sad. I would look the same. Drowsy, unmotivated, sad, hopeless, empty, suicidal... I couldn't live with a feeling like I won't ever see happiness. I was thinking at least 3 times a day about how would I end it all. I was a coward tho. My self-defense mechanism wouldn't allow it. I didn't want to do anything. Whatever I picked up, nothing would bring me joy, any kind of good, or at least occupation. I would be like that for the whole winter. 

By the end of March... B O O M. My suffering ended, or so thought I.

April was a magical month. No sad thought at all. Productive month. The month of a healthy lifestyle. I was shocked but happy (I guess). That month went smoothly. I was waking up early, doing yoga, working out, hiking, eating healthy journaling and nothing would seem like to end it.

I was wrong... following months I was feeling like I was going crazy. Nothing made sense. I would get severe DPDR and my moods would completely random. Circumstances... didn't matter. Events... no. Logic.. irrelevant. 

Then summer followed. What a relief everybody said. Not me tho. But me too. How? Lemme explain.

Since I was so focused on myself with all that ""illnesses"" (I was always self-cautious about being hypochondriac and have been feeling guilty about it) I wasn't focused on school (at all, never ever). 

I've always hated school and rat race type of life. I was skipping classes (whole days actually). I simply wasn't interested. Whenever I thought of school I would get sick and my inner me would scream out of hatred. 

I was supposed to do my additional tests by the end of the summer break. But guess what? I failed. Therefore, I would repeat the whole year. I didn't. You might ask why? I already did. So I got kicked out and sent to a crossroad. 

No education, low wage job, 18yo, living with parents. What do I do next? Either get into a new school or get a standard job. What did I do? Again... nothing.

I was genuinely happy. I felt like my ""depression"" went away for good. I felt normal. The school wasn't pressuring me anymore. The school was the problem. I figured it out. 

The wonderful month of ""true freedom"". 

Knock knock. Who's there? DPDR.

Right. It started hitting me again like crazy. I would get sad/happy randomly again but more stable (a mood for a week). Stable but not stable actually. I still don't see any patterns, reasons, or causes.

I also feel strong voltage-like in the back of my brain. It feels so physical. I don't really know. Will I get to know what is the root of me, basically?

If I could somehow maintain focus for more than 5 seconds it would probably go faster all that realizing.

Anyways...

Basically what happened is that I was living with my mates at Uni and during the lockdown I was really struggling with my mental health, I was feeling depressed and really lonely and made me think some upsetting stuff, and it made me do some stupid shit which I really regret, they caught me listening to them outside their room when they were by themselves and I know what I did was wrong and I hate myself for it, but I was really lonely and depressed at the time and it was something that calmed me doing just knowing what they were doing, but they caught me doing it and called me out and proceeded to vote me out of the house even after I explained to the best I could about my mental state and how I was feeling, and even after I left they proceeded to spite me by going on my own property and erasing my personal information on it blocking me on social media and changing my usernames to weirdo, now I just want people’s personal opinion on the situation, was what I did so bad it warrants that response, did they over react, I just want peoples opinions because a lot of my close friends and family say similar things to how I feel but I would like to know a strangers perspective because I struggle to think about other shit and it does affect my mental health, appreciate the help of people offer it",24Dec2020,1

43,"Hi everyone,

The holidays are coming up and I am getting pretty anxious, I was wondering if anyone could offer some advice or support. 

I have been battling with depression, panic disorder, ADHD, and C-PTSD for years but just got formally diagnosed back in June after reaching my breaking point for what seemed like the millionth time while visiting my family in my hometown. My family was not the only trigger that put me in this kind of a position, but they’ve been a pretty consistent trigger throughout my life. I feel so torn, pressured, and obligated to do things like spend equal amounts of time at each parent’s house, do everything my parents and siblings ask me to do with/for them, and not object or cause any problems. This gets rough because in one household, my mental well-being is explicitly prioritized because that parent has actually listened to me and has made an effort to understand what causes my panic attacks, immense anxiety, and overwhelming depression every time I’m in my hometown. This parent gives me my alone time, asks me for consent before making plans, and respects my choices whenever I say “no.” On the other hand, going to my other parent’s house is basically like playing a game of “Simon” except instead of getting a random sequence of four flashing colors, I get a random sequence of the four trauma responses. They prioritize my youngest sister’s mental health above all else because she is the most vocal when she doesn’t get her way. If she asks me to do something with her and I say “no,” I’m guilted into it by my parents. If she knows that I’m in town but I’m at the other parent’s house, with friends, or enjoying some alone time, she nags me ceaselessly to drop everything and hang out with her and, when I don’t answer, she nags my parents until they guilt me into pacifying her. 

Now that y’all have the background, here’s what’s got me anxious right now. Since starting treatment in June, I have made a tremendous amount of progress in learning to cope with my wild-card brain. Most of this was because I worked so hard to cut out things and people who were serving no purpose other than being constant triggers, amplifying the negative beliefs I had about myself, or hindering my growth and recovery. Other than that, it’s been a lot of unlearning and relearning every core belief I had before starting treatment. I have been recovering in the peace of my own apartment 500+ miles away from my hometown for the past six months, but I have to go up for a week for the holidays starting tomorrow. I am so anxious that my progress will begin to unravel as I am placed in these circumstances, as my boundaries are already being tested...and I haven’t packed yet!! If this is how it is starting—exactly how it always has before—I am so worried of the damage this week could have on all the progress I’ve made. How do I make it through the holidays without “backsliding” so to speak? (Yes, not only did evangelical Christianity give me C-PTSD...it also gave me a vocabulary word for this!) 

Thanks friends, sending lots of love to all of you.",24Dec2020,1
44,"so ive never been formally diagnosed with anything, because i have a complete inability to talk about my issues with anyone other than people i really trust (and by this i mean i am physically incapable), over the past few years ive looked over a bunch of symptoms of a bunch of disorders, and almost every time i view them i see myself in them, including developmental disorders like autism. i have no idea what this could mean for me and was wondering whether there are many people with a similar issue? i know that most disorders have overlap with others but it still kinda freaks me out. sorry if this post is really dumb lol",24Dec2020,1

A little background: I live in a slightly abusive household where I've always been the person to fix everyone arguing so i have pretty bad anxiety connected to sounds, making me think people are arguing alot and have to check on them when most of the times it's just talking or something.
Besides that I have had intense visual hallucinations before, little similar to sleep paralysis, but it's been over a year.

47,"Hi guys, 

So recently me and my girlfriend had a talk which lead her to telling me that she’s been depressed. She said she doesn’t have the will to continue school and have no motivation in her life. She kept all of this from me because she doesn’t really talk about her personal problems with others. When I asked her to go get help for our relationship to talk to a therapist she said she doesn’t like talk to someone about her life. I’m just not sure what I can do to help, she could get really private about her problems. She didn’t tell me that she’s failing her class when she knows that I always try to make sure she’s doing good on her class. I told her that she could talk to me about anything, I know some of her problems she doesn’t talk with anyone else even her family. I just don’t know how to deal with people that keeps everything really private. I just don’t want her to say that she will talk to me when she’s depressed but decided to not talk about it at all. I would really appreciate if you guys could give me some advice how to help her or making sure that she knows I’m there for her. 

*note: she’s really good at hiding her “depression” side. I know a lot of stuff about her without asking her but I didn’t know that she’s been depressed in the past several months

*another note: also she’s always tired and can’t get enough with sleep (not sure if that’ll help but I saw an ad that telling me it’s a sign of depression)

But here goes...

These past few years I've been in a downward spiral in regards to my mental health. Im not sure how to handle much of anything anymore, between random urges to get drunk/high on anything, PTSD flashbacks, days of awful, draining depression, and panic attacks, I don't even have control of my life anymore.

Every night before I go to bed I have awful anxiety attacks which are usually followed by flashbacks and ending with depressive and intrusive thoughts. On top of this, I can't see a psychiatrist or therapist because of my parents, (Im 17)  if i say i need to see someone they either shrug it off or they say they'll do something but end up doing absolutely nothing. I am tired. Every day I open my eyes I want nothing more than to go back to sleep

My HPPD (Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder) makes all of this worse too, for context I abused Cannabis and various psychedelics for many years before the permanent effects became apparent. Now on top of my preexisting conditions I have to deal with a thick layer of static over everything I see, random dissociative spells and general confusion. It makes my anxiety awful and my PTSD worse. 

Everything together makes my daily life a living hell.

Isn't it easier to just blame myself for the horrible things that happened even if it was out of my control? Sometimes I think I could've done something to prevent it, I could've done better, I could've done something. I've spent years trying to convince myself that it's not my fault for being born this way and it's not my fault for being in that kind of situation, but it's hard to remember that when the people you love, family members, etc, always remind you and pick on you because of it. 

They know that it's not my fault, but they sometimes claim that people aren't being true to me, that they're just feeling bad for me which is why they choose to hang around. This is the reason why I don't trust anyone in this household and I have trouble trusting other people, because I feel like when I become vulnerable around other people, I'm just giving them the ability to hurt me.

56,"So I'm gonna start this by saying that I have lived with at least two narcissistic parents throughout my early childhood. I grew up with manipulation and emotionless behavior. I didn't realize until I thought about my current ""dating"" life, that I'm the same way. I have gone into a relationship pretending to be the person's perfect partner only to leave them the moment I get bored or fall out of love with them. I dated two girls (both were toxic) and the first one yelled at me for hours about how I dropped them the moment I got bored. I'm going to specify that while we were ""dating"", I was suffering from an eating disorder that got me hospitalized. I told them everything they wanted to hear. The moment I got back from the hospitalization, I ghosted them. No contact. I got back to school and told everyone we had never dated. I was ashamed of having dated her. She thought we were still together and so every time she was affectionate I told people she was convinced we were dating because we'd kissed a few times. Obviously, someone told her the news. She cussed me out and told me I was a piece of dog s\*\*t. I used this ""breakup"" to get an excuse to not have to visit family that weekend. Now when I think about it, I feel like a piece of crap. The second time, probably 3-4 months after the first incident, I started talking to this second girl. She was in a relationship with someone whom she didn't even know well. I told the girl she should start sitting with my friends and me because we had more fun. She eventually developed feelings for me. About a month later, her mom drops her off at my house and she hangs out at my house for about three days. At this point, she is still with her girlfriend. (I'm a dude btw). She admits she has feelings for me on my bedroom floor. She opens her phone and shows me a text to her girlfriend saying they needed to talk later that night. I then kiss her, FULL WELL KNOWING SHE IS TECHNICALLY STILL IN A RELATIONSHIP. Anyways, I proceeded to tell her that nothing happened and she needed to stop being dramatic since we weren't dating so we didn't break up. There's a part of me saying this is terrible and I should feel guilty, but there's also part of me that likes the game of cat and mouse and the thrill. I have been repeatedly told I'm a psychopath due to the ability to choose who I'm empathetic towards. I can watch someone get stabbed and feel nothing. I also have high intelligence and of course, I am manipulative. I feel pretty guilty. Sorry, this is long just needed to get it off my chest.",24Dec2020,1

I’m on a mood stabilizer and an anti psychotic that keep me largely stable and I’ve been attending college and absolutely smashing my STEM degree courses. That’s the good news disclaimer. Now for the main point.

While it’s obviously fiction, I really felt the flashback scenes in Daredevil season 3 with bullseye, particularly the first therapy session. When he is asked if he feels bad about the coach’s death, he says no, because he was a jerk who never let him do what he wanted. The therapist points out that bullseye had always liked the coach and that this was an abrupt turn(and writes down BPD as a diagnosis). This is my main issue with relationships in real life. Splitting absolutely sucks. I have lost so many friendships due to splitting and it sucks, but now that I’ve got a diagnosis and proper meds things have been going well for the last year. I am also far more open about having BPD with close friends, which seems to help them understand me better when I do slip.

Some days start slower, some days start fast, some days you might feel like wanting to do nothing, some days you might want to do it all; Have some fun during your day but remember; **THE AMOUNT OF WORK DONE WILL GUIDE YOU ON THE SPEED OF WHERE YOU WANT TO GO.**

**Take your time. Go Fast. Its Up to You.**

Everyday I make sure that I am doing a few things that are fun, getting outside, bike rides, playing video games, meditating. Its amazing the amount of energy that can come from meditating from Outside of Ourselves. It takes time, it takes practice and I am constantly practicing, everyday, every moment.

Its Our Turn. The year is about to switch over, but don't wait until it hits ""January 1"", to start your goals, ""resolutions"", **START THEM NOW.** Write a list down and start working towards 1, right now in this very moment. You can. Something that always helps me, is recognizing that if I do 1 thing towards my goal, passions, crafts, mental health; then I am progressing and thats all that matters. Moving Forward, Evolving, Progression. The Path is day to day, consistently, rather than one day here, one day there. Obviously you don't have to do EVERYTHING everyday and can take breaks in between days, but that will allow you to focus on other things in between those ""break days"".

Today: Do Something New. I believe in you. I believe in us.

I love you.

I'm feeling angry that I went to a few different therapists and they didn't catch this - that they said I was depressed but that CBT wasn't ""for me."" I'm angry that no one in my life caught this or ever talked to me about it. I'm angry that I've spent almost 30 years of my life not really living my life, not developing hobbies or interests all because I'm so obsessed with, well, my obsessions. I'm angry because I feel like my brain is fundamentally broken because I don't know if I remember life before my brain operated the way it does now. I know that I won't always feel this way - at some point, I tried to see my depression as just another part of me that, while has its downsides, also provides me with some strengths that not everyone else has. But in the meantime it just sucks and I think I need a few more days to just wallow in my self pity, so thanks for hearing me out anyone who read this.

Hopefully this will help diagnose and weed out the specific causes of my anxiety and provide a professional treatment for my case: a sort of targeted approach. However, as someone who loves to learn, I don't want to simply be ""treated and cured"", I want to be a part of my own growth; so, the other two resources I've set for myself are:

1. Reading one book per month about psychology/mental health from a scientific perspective. ( more comprehensive, but less applicable)

82,"So, I have a history of depression and self-hatred. Once upon a time, it was really, really bad. But I've grown a lot since then, and I feel like I've gotten a pretty good handle on my mental health.

The depression can still get bad sometimes, but I'm no longer in the dark about it. For the most part I can take care of myself and I trust myself not to let it get as bad as it once was ever again.

But I still struggle with my self-image. I don't hate myself anymore, I worked really hard to overcome that, but I still don't like myself. I have zero self-confidence, and it affects my everyday life so much. I can't stop questioning every little thing I do. I can't make new friends because i feel like I'm being annoying if i try and keep an conversation going, I can't keep up with hobbies because I don't believe I'll ever get any good at it, I can't really ever feel accomplished about anything I've done for more than a day or sometimes a few hours because I just can't believe that anything I do is really that great.

I couldn't tell you how many opportunities I've missed, passed up, because I doubt myself so much. I never win arguments even when I KNOW I'm right because I just have no confidence in anything that I do or say.

I've been trying for a long time to overcome this, but sometimes it just feels impossible. I don't think there's ever been a time in my life that I loved myself- even as a kid, I'd criticize myself constantly. It's hard to try and change things now.

94,"I was diagnosed with MDD, anxiety and chronic PTSD. I'm 15 years old (F) and am a sophomore in high school. I've been a straight A student, great at art, but other than that, there's nothing else to me. I've been on antidepressants for a couple of weeks and I feel extremely numb.

My family triggers my PTSD. Every time I see my parents I feel disgusted. I still remember all the things they've said and done in the past (mainly middle school). (**Trigger warning for the next paragraph: verbal abuse**)

They've called me disgusting, dirty, lazy, ugly, fat, skinny, small-eyed, big-headed, a fucker, bitch, and a lot of other names. They told me no one would love me except them, and that I was lucky to have them as my parents. My mother gave me death threats if I didn't clean my room or put my phone down. She threatened to kill herself and self-harmed in front of me. She also threatened to kill me or strip me naked and kick me out, or take me to a place I would get raped. She also threw my dog once, and accused me of hurting her in front of my sister. My step-father punched the wall next to my head once, and threw a lot of things to intimidate me.

The main thing that stuck with me, apart from depression/anxiety/PTSD and low self-esteem, was: ""If people found out who you really are, no one would like you."" I had horrible hygiene in middle school due to my depression, and they always shamed me for it. They would threaten to take pictures of my room and upload them online, or share them with my friends.

Sure, things have gotten better at home and they have changed a little. To be honest, though, I'm not ready to forgive either of them. My mother has apologized (""I'm sorry, but none of it would have happened if you had just behaved), and has offered to lend an ear if I ever wanted to vent. I did vent, but she turned everything I said against me. Narcissistic tendencies, I swear.

This all happened when I was around and between the ages of 7-13. I developed an eating disorder as well as acid reflux/GERD (which both of them deny I have). I frequently had sleep paralysis and nocturnal seizures in middle school, and now I sleep horribly (waking up several times during the night, waking up early, trouble falling asleep, etc.). I'm also underweight and my grades have been slipping.

I still hate them for what they did. They don't seem to have changed much. They do the bare minimum and expect me to thrive. I had a panic attack recently, and they just treated me like I'm crazy. My step-father told everyone I talked to that I'm lying about everything.

I kind of pity them, as well. They're so stuck up and in denial. They could turn around and change things, but they're unwilling to acknowledge their faults. They both had horrible childhoods, but I just don't care. Nothing justifies any of what they did. And I'm so tired of people telling me to let it go, or that I'm just being sensitive.

Sometimes I want to commit suicide just so they understand how much pain I feel. But then again, they'd probably use that to gain sympathy from others. Lord, I just hate it here. They also apparently can't afford to get me therapy, yet my mother has had a hell of a lot of plastic surgery.",24Dec2020,1

Consumption

These toxic thoughts that come to me and imprison me within my own mind. They haunt not only my reality, but my existence as a whole. It shouts and shrieks as I continue to consume, for it is so fearful of the food. The voice within my own mind grows stronger as I follow its commands, for its power grows much more within me. It seemingly overthrows me from my own control center. The throne I kneel before unaware it was birthed from my own lies. Distorting my beliefs and body image only to lock me within this toxic and seemingly endless cycle of hurt. An endeavor of immense pain from within our loved ones and a society which has valued our looks over our mental health. For these wounded souls must live with the judgement of others and be shamed for a distortion within our corrupted minds. We as social outliers must walk our path meanwhile our society as a whole drilled us into believing these disproportionate and unrealistic physical expectations. A manifested disease within our conscious which never truly goes away but simply is dimmed with the aid of recovery. Stigmatized for a disorder which seemingly shaped itself into our minds as a friend in a time of need. A method of controlling the uncontrollable for life is one of mystery and unmanageable destiny. And the restless demons within my own mind manifest into an addiction. One which torments one at night, and steals me throughout the day. But this friend of mine is no longer for I am a warrior of the mind.

104,"Hello, so my friend is a 15 year old male and I am a 14 year old male. I don’t know if that’s important or not.

My friend often texts me through the day mostly just sending me videos he found funny, but often he will talk to me about his feelings. He has experienced a lot of loss in his life from what  he has told me. He has also attempted suicide a couple years prior, but he says he no longer wants to commit suicide. He is currently seeing a therapist, but he isn’t comfortable enough to tell them everything. He has a strained relationship with one of his best friends (let’s call them K) and he is looking for a relationship, but it hasn’t worked out for him, which has caused him to become more depressed. Today he told me a story that was rather sexual in nature and later he told me that he got blocked by someone (let’s call them Q). After a little prying it turned out that he got blocked by Q because he told them the same story and it made them feel uncomfortable and he was then lectured by K about it. He texted me and said really self deprecating stuff such as “I am the worst trash on Earth”. He said that he felt this way because he creeped them out and he never wanted to be called a creep. After a little bit more prying he revealed that one of his friends was killed because someone kept making them uncomfortable and was a creep to them (I didn’t ask any further questions about this I just apologized for their loss). After this I just recommended that they be more careful to make sure they don’t make people uncomfortable in the future and recommended they speak to their therapist to see if they have any input. Then I realized that my suggestions were only making it worse so I just said that in the future when he doesn’t want me to give suggestions to just say beforehand that he just wants to vent and he agreed to that.

I want to help my friend but I just don’t know how. They’ve been through so much and I don’t know how I can help other than just being there, giving my recommendations, and telling them to see their therapist about it. I wouldn’t normally post this but I am lost on how to help them so I would like some input from others who are more experienced with this stuff. With his history it makes me really concerned that if I can’t help him then he might end up doing something, but I don’t know if I bring up my concerns about him committing suicide based on his past would make things worse and if he would then be afraid to tell me his issues, because I know that he is telling me more than his therapist. I already feel like I am breaking his trust by making this post but I don’t know what else to do because I feel that he won’t really talk to anyone other than me about this.",24Dec2020,1
105,"I’m lost, I’m angry, I’m depressed. I left my job, I lost my dad last week, I lost my great grandpa in November, my partners cousin committed suicide.. I feel so angry all the time and just don’t see a point in anything anymore.

106,"So my dad have always had a bad temper, but nowadays the reason for it is getting stupid. He would often rant about how bad his colleague was to him, saying that they’re taking advantage of him. He also thinks the next doors neighbors have bad intentions with him just because they closed their doors too loudly once, and ever since then he would slam the door whenever they comeback. He then once suspected my mom of cheating and lost his temper over it. Then he would get mad and lose his temper(even threatened to kick me out of the house/throw my things out/leave the family) at me over little things like ‘filling the cup with too much drink’ or ‘not preparing plates for dinner before he came home’ and even wrongdoings that he did and now it’s my fault for ‘not correcting it’ for him. Honestly it’s getting tiring when this shit keeps happening every week and sitting through silently with all the insults thrown at me about how I’m selfish/stupid/hypocritical/evil/lazy etc. At first I wanted to pin it on mans ego and pride because he would never admit wrong, likes authority within the house, wants to feel important(in fact he even told me to never hurt a man’s ego like bitch tf???). Since I’m an avid fan of true crime and the psychology behind it, it didn’t take me too long to connect the dots. I even googled symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and he matched most of it. But I’m still quite unsure since I’m not even at the age where I’m mature enough to comprehend and analyze people’s mental health. So I’m wondering if this is valid and if it is how should I confront him about it?

109,"All of my acts feel so insignificant. Like nothing matters. It's not that I would car if it mattered either. I dont care about anything. Myself. My life. Anyone. I do mean anything. I could murder someone. Cut them up into little pieces. And I'm not sure it would bother me. I wouldn't blink. It wouldnt scar me. I would have no problem doing it. I know where I'm going to end up. In large part because I know my potential. I'm going to end up as a homeless drug addict. Though sometimes i do suffer from delusions. Not the paranoia or psychotic delusions I sometimes suffer from. I sometimes think hidden in the depths of of my fucked up mind is something great. Something unique. But those are just delusions. I have many things I could talk about. My sick attractions. Rape and pedophilia. Even worse things sometimes turn me on. What if you cut someones leg in half, slid out their bone, and fucked the hole that it left. I bet it would feel good. Isnt that a turn on? It's not that I want to be attracted to these things. I know they're sick. They disgust me as well. I didnt choose this. I was born like this. I could talk about my anxiety. How much it control my life. Or ny sadness. And how much that controls my life as well. All of my trauma. So many horrible things that I will never speak about. But I guess I'll talk about my demon. Because that seems relevant. Theres something horrible inside me that could potentially encourage me to commit these acts. Though I've surpressed that part of me. He was free when I was a child. And he still comes out at times of extreme anger. Thing is, I sometimes anger very easily. Especially when I fixate on my past. My traumas. When they're running through my mind. Hopefully nobody even slightly bothers me in those moments. Sometimes that wont even be the case though. I'll just be doing something. Somebody will be walking around. Stomp stomp stomp stomp stomp stomp stomp. Their feet. It annoys me heavily. Bothers me. Frustrates me. In a matter of seconds that can build up to an insane reaction. Extreme anger. Extreme action. I have a problem. Like the. Blackouts. Maybe I shouldn't call them blackouts. Because I dont black out. There is just times where I do bad things that I don't remember. For example, apparently one time I flooded the school bathroom. They questioned me. Punished me. But I could not recall what happened in those moments. Sometimes that demon comes out and i enjoy doing things like that. Evil things. Even when I'm not angry it could happen. Though when I'm angry a dark side of me shows. As a child I remeber my brother doing something to me, I chased after him. He ended up hitting me multiple times with a board. It didnt phase me. I dont seek to feel pain in that state. I just push. Usually with the intention of doing something bad. Then theres other states. Like that one time my brother found me in the woods. I ran away. It was night. Coyotes were around me. When he found me he said my eyes were black. I think that changed him a bit. I dont remember half of that night. Another blackout. We can talk about all the times I've threatened to do horrible things to people. I meant it in that moment to. My family is scared of me. Everyone is scared of me. Even people I've never talked to. I think it's because of my expression. Well I'm done writing for now. I just wanted to get some of my thoughts out. Goodbye.",24Dec2020,1

I always put a smile to the people around me, but when I was 13 until at the age of 16, I experienced many deaths in my eyes, my grandparents died, relatives died and a few of my friends died in consecutive months or years. After that, it felt like I am afraid witnessing the people around me dying, I fear that my remaining known people dies and it reach to the point where I overthink about their safety and I always panic when I can't get their status. I became home-person and do not desire to go outside, but I still want to communicate with other people. I always ask questions and I get too curious a lot for the well-being in my relatives and friends. 

I don't think seriously about depression, anxiety, and any other mental illness that I may have, I just think of it as a joke and brag it out to my friends to make fun of it, but as I progress throughout the year, my body felt collapsing, it feels like I don't want to do anything or even move. I always stare straight and do not even think (like a living corpse), ending my life is always in my mind but I do not think I will do that thing, but I feel that myself only awaits for my death like I'm an old man waiting for his time, I don't even mind if I get sick and die from it. The only thing that holds me back is that I am too conscious to everything and I feel that my whole body and mind, act independently. My heart desire for more experience while my brain is like a hard drive that doesn't want any more experiences anymore and desires to shutdown.

That is why I want to seek help, my parents, relatives, friends and my ex-partner failed to do it. Seeking from psychiatrist in my country is like giving a money to a monkey where it doesn't even listen and straight up diagnose you a random mental illness and only prescript anti-depressants.

I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me but I know something is. I can't even get proper diagnosis or anything because where I live mental illnesses are severely frowned upon and so is getting help for them. I feel so tired all the fucking time, and so fucking drained. I never have the motivation for anything anymore. I used to love to write but even doing that feels so hard these days. It's hard to want to do anything really. Most of the time I just want to die because everything feels so fucking hard. Everyone where I live is a religious fucking nut and I just hate it.

He's just fucking broken me and I'm so tired. He's just absolutely fucking perfect and it can never be his fucking fault. To him I'm just a spoiled entitled brat that can never measure up.

My mom berates me for being lazy and fat and not having friends but god she didn't care when I told her I'd tried to kill myself she was only upset at the fact that I'd been angry with her. I can never cry be angry or anything other than happy. My sisters were angry at me for ever having been angry at our dad and god just I'm always fucking wrong. They ask me to be more open but when I am they berate me for it. I started cutting myself a while back because it's the only thing that helps and I tried to kill myself a couple of times because I was so just tired. The last time I did, when I cut my wrist and had been bleeding out I'd felt at peace. I'd felt ok with dying because living had been too fucking hard. I was so frustrated that it didn't fucking work and still am because just god everything feels like a chore. I'm always paranoid that the only proper friends I've had, the ones on discord all hate me even though they tell me time and again they don't.

134,"Is it extreme or unreasonable to not attend my mom’s side of the family Christmas get-together?

Let me elaborate; 

The main reason I don’t want to go (and haven’t gone for the past 2 years) is because 2 of my aunts constantly go around taking pictures of everyone without their consent and then post them on Facebook for hundreds of people to view WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT...

-This is a problem for me because I get EXTREMELY self-conscious when I see pictures of myself that someone else took... so much so, that I will be depressed about it for months on end and I’ll get in my head too much and I’ll start viewing myself in such a horrible way and I’ll avoid going in public or even hanging with friends because I don’t want to be seen. I don’t like the way I look... especially if I can’t control the angles and stuff. I hardly EVER take selfies... but when I do I never show my body. And that’s what I hate most about my aunts taking pictures of me... I hate my body... and on top of that I don’t want hundreds of their Facebook friends to see my body... it makes the feeling even worse... and it makes me extremely uncomfortable.

Another reason it bothers me is because these 2 specific aunts.. well, actually almost the entirety of my moms side of the family are extremely fake and judgmental. They literally used to bully me throughout my entire childhood or point out my flaws either straight to my face or in another room where I could clearly hear them... and they’ve literally given me a complex because of how vile they were to me growing up. 

I mean, I’m not comfortable around my own family... read that again. 

Not to mention, my mom is the only humble/normal one out of her 3 other sisters.... I mean they’re literally obsessed with their looks, materialism, vanity, etc. so much so, to the point they judge EVERYONE. They all recently got new houses and furnished them with all brand new fancy items and made them appear straight out of a magazine catalog... it’s not even homey feeling when we have Christmas there. 

Also, can I just say?..... middle aged white women (like my aunts) are obsessed with Facebook and likes...... everything they do is to post about it. They can’t go anywhere or do anything without taking pictures and posting them. I mean everything they do down to the shirts they buy to the cups they drink out of is for the validation of people on Facebook and you best bet they keep up with every recent trend. They’ve all become so fake that I don’t even know how to connect with them anymore... their face is always in their phone and they’re always posting. It doesn’t even feel like the real world anymore. 
 I miss the old days when we had Christmas at my Nana’s house (in her trailer) and everyone was either laughing, playing outside, baking together, playing board games, playing Just Dance on her little tv in the living room, all the kids playing with their freshly unwrapped toys........ it just isn’t the same and it makes me so sad.

So I’ve gotten to the point I don’t even enjoy/want to go to my own family’s Christmas. For many more reasons than one. And it sucks that my nana won’t even be there (because of Covid) It literally used to be “Nana’s Christmas” now the aunts have taken over and it’s become a game of “who’s going to flash their fancy house and money this year while we take pictures of you despite you not wanting your picture made” 

Also, don’t get me wrong, I understand taking a group Christmas picture every year to hang on the wall or something. But in today’s standards... it’s literally 50+ pictures of everyone just sitting around minding their business where someone could be taking a huge bite or freaking picking their nose for Christ sake... and only for it to go up on Facebook without (said person in the picture’s) consent. No one even prints out pictures to put on their wall or to put into a photo album anymore. They stay digital and go straight to social media. 
I just don’t understand the times we’re living in, and I don’t want any part in it. 

I miss the days of watching The Polar Express, drinking hot cocoa, and not worrying about your picture being made and just enjoying the moment. 

Does anyone else relate to this? Also, what should I do? Christmas Day is literally tomorrow and it’s giving me increasing anxiety. And you’re free to PM me if you want... I kinda wish I had someone to talk to right now. 

Thanks in advance. 

Also, plz don’t be mean. ;-;",24Dec2020,1
135,"my eating has been quite disordered recently and normally i just have something small around dinner time but today was the first time i had some breakfast since april!

136,"I've been more or less isolated for 13 years, I'm 24 now. I've had a few friendships but after a while people can't stand me.

I believe that I was often incredibly selfish in these friendships, I would rarely ever consider another person's feelings, and would just do anything that satisfied me in the moment. Deep down I could see the wrongdoing in this, but perhaps my self hatred kept me doing it. I've often felt regretful for that.

In the last 6 years I have hardly interacted with people. At times I sort of live vicariously through characters, and watching them go through life and make those kinds of important connections in a story is kind of a great pleasure. It is also also a great pain, in loneliness and old memories.

It makes me wonder if this is a life worth living. I believe it's a waste to live without any special connections in your life. That's one thing I would trade everything for, just to have someone understand me and be there with me.

But the thought of being vulnerable nearly brings me to a panic attack. So I live my life mainly cold, and at times emotionless, never letting anyone in. And I don't know any other way to live anymore. I sort of hate myself for it. Because I'm constantly misunderstood, but I have to say it's my fault.

When you see someone who is cold and emotionless, I have no idea what people are thinking. I just have to think it makes me hard to talk to and get along with.

So I'm not sure how I'm going to make it happen in my life. I'm staying at home recently, my life isn't going anywhere, and I'm slowly going crazy with loneliness.

So I want to ask you redditors for advice. I know it's fairly pointless but I have no one to turn to.",24Dec2020,1
137,"**NOTE - I am not here, by any means, to diminish other people's experiences and repercussions of the pandemic. Many have been made affected in all sorts of ways - overworking, unemployment, mental health issues, loneliness, loss of loved ones and so on. Even I was affected by this from an indirect manner.**

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, whenever I see people saying that 2020 was the worst year ever, I question whether this perception is true.

Honestly, I have been dealing with lots of issues even before the pandemic. Most of the time, I had to do them on my own - depression, anxiety, PTSD, and even loneliness.

Many have said that they have been feeling quite lonely and have been going through lots of mental health issues but from my perspective, I have been dealing with these things for at least 10 years and I know that it is not easy but I have this impulse tendency (in a jokingly manner) to say ""amateurs!"". I mostly had to do this on my own because these troubles are invisible and to get the right amount of help and social support is difficult because of taboo, lack of awareness or knowledge, social pressures and so on.

I get that these mental health troubles and other repercussions of the pandemic are not easy and very new to many people. But at the same time, I wonder whether these reactions are authentic or exaggarated.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I do admit that the pandemic has not been easy. And perhaps I am being biased here because I have been dealing with these complicated and damn right exhausting issues for quite a while now so I got used to it. I know that it sucks a lot but I got used to it in some way

&amp;#x200B;

Plus, I feel that the pandemic made things a lot of easier for me because as the world slowed down, I felt that I was able to keep up more in my own pace. Yes, I have not been able to travel or go out and meet other people but because of the current rate of how things operate in the world of today, I felt that it was too much to keep up with and it was exhausting.

Now I feel like I am able to feel more at ease with this slowed down pace. Yes, it is slightly boring and not many things are happening (especially that we live in an era where we are constantly given this mentality of being fed and stimulated all the time, or demand to be stimulated all the time) but I felt that my life was more managable that way",24Dec2020,1
138,"I feel very alone with strong suicidal feelings and it is so painful. 
I come from an abusive family I barely keep contact with, I have run away even from the country as soon as I finished high school and I never returned. 

I lost my job in June due to covid redundances, it was a career I had for 13 years and there is no chance of return anytime soon. I don't have any more money left (there is no social security measures like unemployment support in the middle eastern country I live in.)

I live with my husband, he grew up with his mother being depressed so when he sees me this way he gets triggered, he calls me weak, he even tells me he won't miss me if I were to die. I know he doesn't mean it, he is just triggered, but it really hurts, and it reinforces the idea in my head that I could just hide away and quitely ""check out"" without hurting anyone.
The only reason I find for staying alive is my cat, I'm horrified thinking of what would happen to him.

I have friends but I don't want to burden them with my mental health issues and I'm also scared if I open up about it they would run away from me.

There is no free mental health care in the country I live in, even medication for mental illneses are not covered under most insurance plan (you can't choose your insurance, it depends on who sponsors your visa, like your employeer, husband's employeer etc). Even if I would go to ER for suicide fear I would be charged heavily as any mental health concerns get immidiately rejected by insurance. They only recently decriminalised suicide over here, but mental health is still a taboo.
I have highs and lows resembling bipolar 2 for a long time but I never went for a diagnoses because of the fear of my company being allerted and me being fired. Yes it is a thing over here, if you are a risk to yourself or others (I'm not), they can tell the police and your employer... who can be traced back through your identity card.
Now I don't have an employeer anymore but also no money for mental health care..

143,"title says it all really.

I didn't want to come home in the first way due to covid and feeling like shit, however I've spent 90% of this year alone and was able to travel under guidance before it all changed and I was allowed to purely for the fact I didn't really want to spend my Christmas all alone especially when I already feel so low.

I've tried sitting in my room just by myself but am finding myself becoming increasingly irritated with my family feeling like they're constantly bugging me asking to watch films/make cakes etc when I've already said I want to just sit watching films or TV by myself. I go for a walk to the shops and back most days to get out of the house and to try and get some exercise. 

I'm trying my hardest not to snap at everyone, as life is already so stressful for people anyway.

I'm on medication but can't get a doctors appointment until next year to change my meds as they admittedly aren't the best for me.

How can I cope with feeling extremely anxious and although I've already discussed with my family how my mental health is right now I don't feel they get it.

weve had lengthy discussions in the past as I've tried meds and therapy for my mental health and my family are fortunate enough to not suffer with mental health issues on level with mine. 

I realise I am very fortunate to be able to spend Christmas with my family, however I feel this way every single year when it gets to Christmas time for some reason Ive never been able to figure out why.

150,"I came over here from the SuicideWatch subreddit. The people there were of absolutely no help to me and only made me feel worse about my condition. I don't need to be told to ""suck it up"" and ""move forward."" I'm tired of hearing the same spiel over and over again. I need some real answers. An educated opinion.

I've been to all manner of psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. The only resource to ever help me was therapy, and that was still very mediocre. Most therapists made me feel like they were just checking their watches and waiting for the session to be over. It's a horrible feeling knowing that you're paying someone to do that.

I am now at a point in my life where I can no longer be considered as a dependent under my father's health insurance plan. I turned 26 this year, and they immediately dropped me. I was sent a letter to inform me that I could continue my benefits, but it would come at a price. A price that is completely unaffordable with my budget. Which means that finding affordable mental health services is nearly impossible. I have tried reaching out to the state for help, but I don't qualify for any kind of benefits.

The only diagnosis I've ever received was ""general anxiety"" and ""general depression."" How could these trained professionals not recognize that I was suffering much more than that? I challenged them. I told them that there must be a more underlying issue...but they always turned a blind eye.

And the medications... God, the medications... I've tried so many. Nothing seems to work for me. All manner of antidepressants. The only thing that does work is Xanax, but my family tells me not to take them regularly because I'll ""get addicted.""

I can't control how I feel most of the time, and that's if I'm even feeling real emotions. Everything feels so robotic to me. Like the real me isn't even there. I'm anxious all the time, and it sometimes gets so bad that I start physically shaking. This is all stuff you've probably seen before...but it gets much worse.

I am physically incapable of letting go of the past. Past events that have happened in my life seem to follow me around and pull me back like a leash with a retractable cord. I still have nightmares... traumatic events... My mother leaving when I was 4, getting bullied relentlessly in school, my first real girlfriend, my first breakup, my mistakes in the workplace. And those are only basic examples. It goes on and on. I CANNOT ESCAPE FROM THIS. It runs around in my head until I can't take it anymore and I breakdown into a fit of complete silence. I just sit there in silence and stare. I don't even cry anymore.

I also form unrealistic bonds with people far to quickly. Too quickly to be normal...and it freaks people out. I find myself talking to sale associates in stores as if they were my friends. I do this sort of thing all the time. The same sort of thing happens when it comes to the dating scene. I'll meet a nice girl and then run her off because of my strange bond-forming behavior...it makes me feel like complete shit...like I want to put a bullet in my head.

Christ...I don't even know why I'm typing all of this. It's all pointless in the end.

The scary part is that I don't know how much longer I can take this... I recently purchased firearms and told everyone that it was for my own protection. I even took a course. It was all a lie... It just makes my death easier.

I'm in my mid 40's. I'm married, own a home, have smart and healthy kids, and I own my own business. I should be happy. My job is stressful--IT support for small businesses. Clients are demanding. When things go wrong or we can't get to them in time, they sometimes get angry.

I can watch TV or play a game, because I sort of get lost in those and forget my worries for a bit. That's not what I want to do though. I want to work on something engaging, or play games with my kids, but it's so difficult and exhausting.
(The first week of the pandemic was the most relaxed I've been in years, because I knew that, just like me, none of our clients were working either, and I knew that I had an excuse for not having to drop everything to go see them.)

160,"There's so much I wanna change about my life, right from my place of residence to my current job. I gotta start over from scratch but I find myself unable to. So many milestones I should've crossed by now. I feel unequipped to handle everything and feel like I am just this scared teenager on the inside, even at the age of 22. I've been trying so hard to get my shit together, but I just feel overwhelmed and cry. I've followed every productivity tip in the book, every bit of advice. I've been told that sometimes you just gotta jump right in and wing it, and I tried to. But couldn't. There's so much I wanna do, so much I need change about myself. There are so many ways in which life really sucks for me at the moment and I really gotta help myself,  but feel stuck. I'm just constantly on edge, thinking of the million ways in which the world is out to destroy me. Every time I do try anything, I'm met with constant resistance. 

I feel so unprotected. I wanna feel secure. I wanna feel safe and warm. But I feel like I've been stripped off of courage slowly, every single day. I can't even think straight anymore, I don't even know what's real, and I feel like the world is so fucking fast. I'd like time to stop, I just wanna sit in this vacuum and not have to live with so much pain and unease. Has anyone ever felt this way? Am I just being lazy and immature? How do I get out of this mess?

Now, I don't have a crush on her, I wouldn't date her, and it doesn't feel like love. 
But here's the part, for example, imagine yourself wanting to own something really bad, maybe a car, a really nice suit, etc., etc. 
But you don’t ”love” it, do you? You wouldn't date it, right? 
Well, I got that kind of feeling for her. 
It's like I can't stand other people talking to her; it makes me feel like as if someone ”stole” one of my possessions?
And I feel the need to know what she's doing, where she is..etc. Because if I don't, it makes me feel angry, the kind of when your child snuck out without you knowing? 
And the others aren't” allowed” to mistreat her, for instance, bully her, mock her, or even make fun of her? 
The only person who can treat her like shit, it's me, and only me.

My brother had said to me in a joking manner that its messed him up ( regardless of his tone humor tone?) I take this very seriously as I typically take most things people say very seriously.
Because I know that hes hurting mentally with alot of childhood trauma( all the siblings have had differing trama) and to know I've contributed to this as an older brother breaks me down more than I already am....

I honestly look back now and feel like I was quite and extreme child and I'm most likely ( I feel strongly that I am) autistic. As the brothers I spent the most time with have mentioned my physical transgressions( this only happend as kids pre highschool). 

I'm just shocked and if anyone else was to know they'd think they were talking about someone completely different. 

I'm just so unsure how to process this ontop of what I already cant process and what constructive things I can do to try help them heal( I've told them immediately as they told me that I'm sorry and admitted I was psycho as a child with very little restraint). 

This isnt enough for me reguradless of weather they accept this or not.... how after knowing this( after being so clueless about it ) am I supposed too...?

Lost... I'm utterly shocked and feel bizzare to have missed this???( my memory is very very good).

165,"For context I have been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder, I rapid cycle, alongside traits of BPD, Schizoid, Avoidant and Generalized Anxiety Disorder.  

I don’t have any irl friends, I’m married and usually only hang out with family.  I finally decided to make online friends on discord and it was going great, until it wasn’t.  

Apparently I made quite a few of the women uncomfortable.  My intentions were only ever platonic friendships, but one of the guys flat out called them my victims and said they were terrified of me.  This devastates me, I hate that I made any woman, let alone five feel this way.  I’ve had other online friends that are female that I’ve never made feel this way, but on this discord I made a few of them feel uncomfortable.

I’ve never approached them in a sexual manner, I do have a dark sense of humor, but that’s as far as it goes.  I just feel defeated in trying to make more friends, and I also feel like a piece of shit for making them feel the way that they do.  I just feel like I’m better off alone.  

I carefully choose my words to convey my intent as best as I can, I carefully try to tone my sentences with emojis to not come across confrontational.

169,"I am not sure how to feel. The thought brings me joy but it also is strange because I would never think I am capable of thoughts such as this. As the title states, I have a desire to hurt everyone around me. I have been told by my therapist that I have issues feeling certain emotions like remorse, empathy, etc. and this has affected all of my relationships. However the problem is that when I see my family during the day, half of the time I have the urge to hurt them, whether that be with a weapon or my bare hands. It is also not just my family, in public when I see people I fantasize about hurting them in different ways.

To expand on what type of person I am, I am a narcissist, I used to have bad anxiety but I have started taking medication for it around 2 months ago, I lack certain emotions like empathy, remorse, sadness (I think), I lie a lot to people because it's fun and I manipulate those around me to get my way (I don't feel bad about it at all, I am actually proud of it), I believe I am better than everyone and I haven't gotten anything diagnosed.

This post is because I want the thoughts to stop. I don't want to turn violent (It's strange because part of me wants that to happen). I also want to feel certain emotions and want to care about people (but like half of me likes how everything is and doesn't want me to change).

170," I dissociate at least once a day, from what I assume is my severe depression and stress. It rarely has a particular trigger. I didn’t realize it was dissociation until recently, but it’s been happening since I can remember, just not as frequently. But yesterday, I was dissociating and I was getting waves of it really bad and feeling dizzy, and eventually I passed out. I came to like 5 minutes later and went to lay down. I continued to fade in and out for about 30 minutes and then I fell asleep. When I was out, some of the time I could hear what was going on and feel myself falling, but I couldn’t speak or move and would go fully unconscious for what I think is only a short period of time. This happened again last night, but this time I wasn’t dissociating in the first place, it was triggered by what I think was the stress from trying not to relapse (s3lf h@rm). I felt it happening again and was on the phone with my friend, and I kept going in and out for 2 hours. It sucked because he was having a hard time as well and I could semi-understand what was going on but I couldn’t talk, and eventually I fell asleep or went under for good, I don’t really know.

172,"I’ll start off by saying that I was diagnosed with bpd around 2 years ago. So if this whole story seems bizarre/chaotic - this piece of information will put it in context maybe. 

Before my diagnosis I never really acknowledged I have a problem. I really believed I wasn’t meant to be in this world and was just filled with so much self-loathing and defeat. But through therapy I realized that I need to start building a foundation for myself. And I have accepted that I may not ever be “normal” or rational enough to have healthy relationships. I can still try to fill my life with joy through genuine love of friends, art and music. 

We started dating a bit over a month ago. We’ve known of each other for over a year now but never really gotten close enough to really know one another. Something clicked that one time we saw each other and we’ve taken a step forward. We laugh a lot together and are both very passionate about music. He is a music and visual production artist and one of the things I truly admire about him is how much he loves being in his element. 

We know each other because of the “party scene”. I never used to see him much, he’s known to be introverted and reserved, and really only shows up to parties to do his job and leave. Maybe that’s also one of the reasons why I found him interesting. He said he was attracted to me because I always seem “dazed/there but not there” and that he could tell I’m “troubled” and he thinks he can “fix” me. 

- The first “red flag” was him talking about his ex a lot. And obviously still broken by her. I always try to keep the transparency so I told him that I understand what it’s like getting out of a serious relationship and that I respect his space and time to find himself outside the relationship. I explained that I can’t be with somebody who has unresolved issues from the past. He kept telling me that he’s over it and told me not to worry about it. And I believe him 

- We spent almost every weekend together. If it wasn’t a “date” we’d hang out with our mutual friends. During gatherings, he’s stuck to me like glue he “can’t have a good time” if I’m “not next to him” while sometimes it feels nice being adored, I do need my own space and air to breathe. I think all these years with no “partners” has made me more of an individual whereas he is obviously codependent. He’s always had a partner who he revolved his life around. And I realized maybe I might be part of the pattern

-One weekend I wanted to go to my friend’s birthday party and he came along. He had a flight to catch in the morning so he wanted to leave early, but I didn’t. He got really upset and visibly mad and he kept telling me to go back with him. When I insisted I wanted to stay he said “I came all the way here to spend time with you and you’re just gonna let me go home alone?” I could feel my face filling up with rage and contempt and I saw that he saw it too. While walking to the car I stopped and told him that I need to set boundaries for myself; and I won’t go with him if I’m feeling forced. He went back and slept alone. 

- We’ve already planned to spend New Years together (Thursday - Friday). When I just spoke out my mind about joining my friends on their trip on Saturday - Sunday he was so appalled. His immediate reaction was “do you have a major problem with FOMO or what?” “Are you planning to drag me with you??” And I said “no. Not when you say it like that.” And I decided to be on my own until I’m calm because I was pissed off from his tone. 

I spoke to him last night and told him that we need to remember that we just started dating and that we need to be patient with each other; and that his tone put me off. He said “I was just annoyed because I thought I was gonna go back home with you but I guess not. Do what you want” and I said I will. The stupid thing is I haven’t even decided it was just a thought I said out loud.

I don't tell him anything bc i think he will burst at me for being week, or will start the same rant where he says in my days these facilities weren't there and would never think about my problem. I have solid reasons believe he would say this cuz he has acted in the same way in the past. 

I love him to every pieces of body and soul. My mother came i  my room and said why don't you and your father have dinner together? Why don't you speak much?

175,"I'm failing in school. I think I may have adhd/add. I'm not sure, I need to see a doctor to be diagnosed properly. I can't visit therapist or psychiatrist at the moment or any time soon, however I'm gonna see one in 2+ weeks. I have 4 days until my semester ends, so I need to study and pass all of exams, assignments and tasks that were given

I'm 16 year old girl, I study in high school. I have anxiety and panic attacks, I was diagnosed with it. My anxiety got worse during quarantine. I'm anxious about many things.  I worry about my future, myself, health, money and sometimes I'm anxious and afraid for no reason. I have bad health anxiety because I'm often sick. I often have fever, I'm always very tired, fatigued, dizzy, naseous. My head and stomach hurts all the time. I'm always in pain and feel sick. My symptoms bother me a lot and doctors aren't being able to diagnose anything that could cause all of my symptoms. They did many tests and I saw almost all specialists. I have hypothyroidism which may cause fatigue but I don't think it is the cause for other symptoms. Most of the doctors I met told me that probably it's my mental issues that are causing me pain and physical discomfort

I'm extremely disorganized and messy. My room and life is a mess. I always loose my stuff, I always forget things. I forget the tasks and assignments that are given. Even when I know I have an assignment, it's extremely difficult for me to force myself and make myself start and do the task. During lessons I can't focus at all, it's very difficult for me to pay attention at lesson. I always end up just sitting and not paying attention or getting distracted by doing other stuff. So all of the semester, I almost missed all of the classes. I didn't do homework, I ended up forgetting about it or procrastinating. When exams came, I wrote them really badly. During exam I couldn't get my thoughts and ideas together and write the exam. On the lessons like math, physics where you solve problem, I couldn't solve them, I didn't know how to solve them. On the lessons like languages, history, literature, where you usually write essays, I can't get my thoughts together and focus on writing. It takes me so much time until I actually start thinking about essay and it takes so long to come up with idea. Then it takes me a long time to think about how I will write it. I have only 30 minutes to write 250 word essay. Obviously I can't finish essay on time. Sometimes I even end up not starting the essay

Now, I have 15 exams that I missed or failed and about 10 tasks to do. I'm failing. Today school principle invited my parents to school. All of the teachers told how badly I'm doing and that I'm a terrible student. They told my parents. I'm lazy, irresponsible and that they never met a student who was lazy and disorganized as me.  I'm extremely embarrassed and guilty, because I disappointed my parents. an 2 years I got expelled from my previous school for that reason.

I think I may have ADD/ADHD. It doesn't feel normal, it feels like more than laziness. I tried many study and productivity hacks, nothing works. I have zero willpower or self control. I can't make myself do anything and when I try to do something I fail.

I'm anxious and disappointed at myself. I feel like I'm a failure. I don't have any friends, interests, hobbies and I'm failing school. I'm worried if I'm going to be the same in the future. I don't know how I will study in uni, how I will work, I can't even study in school!

181,"I see a lot of posts from people with ""social anxiety"" or ""depression"" and I have been labeled these terms by others in my life to.  However I'm considering how much of those labels and at what point do they become a social convenience to pin an individual as a certain type of person than acknowledging that they are living a certain type of life which could be different to the groups around them.  I think it occurs and it is easier for a group to call an individual mentally unwell (and perhaps have that person go around thinking they are unwell) than it is for the entire group to accept their own responsibilities and short comings, the evolution of how society has treated an LGBT individual comes to mind for example.
""Social anxiety"" perhaps the group they are in is, they have been bullied or outcast or talked about behind their back, toxic but the individual is the one labeled with the problem.  ""Depression"" maybe they don't have any friends, are kept socially isolated, have lost their job or a loved one - in which case it is perfectly normal to be sad.  
So at what point does cause and effect or the relevance of misdiagnosis gain credibility and those labels lift from an individuals shoulders to a cultural solution?

182,"I (18F) suddenly cried in front of my family while we were eating lunch today (24th of December). I ran in to the bathroom to cry and didn't allow anyone to come in. 
A bit of context:
(Not sure if all of this is relevant)
So I recently moved to a new house so I could go to college. I'm still in the same country but I was raised in an island of that country and I'm now living in the main land. 
My mom and disabled older brother (I've always lived with both) also moved with me, as my mom wanted to move to the main land for a while and me going to college was the perfect reason to finally do it.
College has been very...fast moving. The first semester has ended and the exames are going to start in January. And it feels like I've been holding my breath since college started. I've been so busy that I don't think I have actually processed all that has happened since we moved (I think we moved in August but I'm not sure, I've been forgetting things very easily).

The accident(?):
Between the 23rd and 27th of December, me, my mom and my brother are staying in my maternal grandmother house. My mom's brother also lives there.
So, earlier today, my mom told me to help my grandmother with making lunch because she was having terrible back pain and has been moving non stop since she woke up this morning.
This day, I was having this really intense feeling of just wanting to curl in a corner somewhere and just stay there for a while, so has you can imagine I was feeling very emotionally overwhelmed and refused to help my grandmother. We got in to a sort of verbal fight, and my mom went to help her mother and I just stayed in bed.
I just randomly started crying and didn't understand why, finally I stopped crying when my mom called all of us to come eat.
But apparently I wasn't done crying has you saw in the title.
I know I wasn't crying because I was upset or sad that I fought with my mother, I think it was because I was stressed as I cry when I'm feeling that way.
My family has been checking on me but gave me space when I asked, but they all want me to talk abou it. I want to go to therapy but only if it is online, but I'm not comfortable with talking about this with anyone except my mother as I don't have a close relationship with the rest of my family, I barely know them.
How do I tell them that I'm not comfortable talking with them about this matter? And say to my mom that I want to start therapy?

And for the longest time she’s been saying how she doesn’t want help anymore, that all she wants is to die.

Multiple times she’s told me that she feels like today would be her last day, those days I’ve somehow talked her out of it.

She’s now telling me that everyday she’s in constant pain and that it gets worse and worse.

I don’t know what to do, I’ve tried absolutely everything I can think of but all she wants is to die. She says the only reason why she’s still alive is because she doesn’t want me to grieve her death. So now she’s begging me to let her take her own life.

A part of me feels so selfish to not let her do so, but if I do say yes then I’ll be responsible for her death.

What people don’t realize when they meet others is that you don’t know their story and trust me, everyone has a story. Those were the times of my life that really made me who I am today (I’m still trying to figure out who I am). I am still torn between being grateful that happened to me or still in my deep sorrows that it happened to me.  After 7 years I finally have the courage to really open up about my experience with major depressive disorder. What really pushes me everyday is knowing that life doesn’t stop, it keeps going and you got to pick up the wind whether you can or can’t.

When I was 16 I was bullied in high school, i started cutting myself, caught myself eating lunch in the washroom sometimes, had this bully text me for months telling me I’m worthless, ugly and I didn’t deserve anything, it gave me so much anxiety at school. I had my first boyfriend, it didn’t work out, teenage boys... Insecure about my body, I tried to be better everyday, I hit private gym before and after school, ballet class and gym class in between. I worked at my parents pizza shop everyday after school. My grandpa was dying from cancer and I prayed everyday that his would cure. Since my dad flew back and forth to visit my grandpa, I stayed to help my mom at the pizza shop long hours on school nights. We found out my dad was cheating on my mom during his visits. I got the news that my grandpa passed away and that same day, my house got broken into and robbed. I was devastated when I got home, my back door was missing, the mattresses were tossed and cut up, every drawer just thrown on the floor. You know I really prayed that God could hear me, whatever form or whoever they are. I just wish that someone out there could hear me cry and help me. As age 16 I was naive, always been a good person, student council leader, even volunteered for fun, I knew I had good intentions with everything coming in my life. I remember asking why this happened to me if there really is “God”. After that night I cut myself countless times, deeper with more blood than I ever saw. I didn’t believe in anything anymore. I just didn’t care, all the pain I was feeling in my heart could bleed out through my arms and thighs.  

I was cutting a lot more after me and my bf broke up, I started seeking for counselling. It’s like I couldn’t sleep if I didn’t cut myself before going to bed. I had multiple dreams about this old lady taunting me... my psychiatrist thought I had schizophrenia. I tried killing myself by buying a rope to hang myself and taking multiple sleeping pills, I wrote a good bye letter to my family but I woke up. One night I made a deep cut into my thigh, it wouldn’t stop bleeding so my mom took me to the hospital. They ran some tests on me, I knew I had issues but I didn’t know it was that bad... I would stay in the hospital for 3 months, my psychiatrist and nurses told me I’m the sickest patient they’ve ever seen. I lost 15 pounds since. I stayed in the first room for 1 month, then they moved me to the room down the hall for another month... I spent my time in the hospital painting, journaling and envisioning ways I’d kill myself. I got out on a hospital pass one day, I remember pretending I was getting better but, I still wanted to die everyday, I saw something that triggered me and I jumped off the ledge. It was a 2 story building that I fell from. I remember vividly, ambulance put me on a spinal board and rushed me to  the hospital, I cried that I was still alive. I wanted to try again, so stupid I felt that I failed to die. I was put through X-rays and turns out I broke both my feet. I was put back into my unit this time with a wheel chair. All the other patients knew me, as I stayed in the unit longer than anyone else. My depressive disorder relapsed. I was back in the room I began in. My family was so scared they thought they would lose me forever. I woke up to see my family at my bed crying.

When you have a major depressive disorder, nothing hurts more than living, the person you hate the most is yourself, you keep radiating pain for yourself and you can’t stop it... It sounds crazy but I never felt so much pain in my life, jumping off a 2 story didnt hurt me as much as not dying did. At this point you can really see a person for who they really are. The human condition is all we are made of. My family runs deeper than the ocean. All the other shit doesn’t matter. I continue to try therapy to make my family feel as if I were trying. My doctor put air casts on both my feet. My psychiatrist was feeling as I was getting better. So I got discharged from the hospital after 3 months. But under the condition I stay on my meds forever, stay in therapy and attend a program for 6 months. I learned CBT and I still use it to this day. Transitioning from the hospital to home was hard, sometimes I missed the hospital, life with my air casts on my feet, people looked at me funny, they always asked what happened and it would break my heart every time I lied about “falling down the stairs”.

Today I still think about whether I am ok or not. Maybe I just brushed it off because life kept coming and I had to keep going. I try not to think too deeply into my other self. Yes, I separate my major depressive disorder self from my own self. They are two different people, today I have goals, I have life to live. Those times I was suffocated with pain. I never thought I would live after that happened to me. Whoever thought that I could write this all down, I was capable of it tonight and I am proud of myself. I hope you reading this taught you something about yourself or about someone you know who has a mental illness. Always be kind to whoever you come across, you never know how much underlying pain they are holding to their heart. Everybody has a story",24Dec2020,1
186,"I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder earlier this year and I believe this is the case for me because I can never draw any distinction between “relaxed” or “normal” me (although I never really feel completely relaxed) and anxious me. I know that this wouldn’t be good for my overall physical and mental health but I also think it’s good that I technically don’t notice my anxiety as it just feels normal. So, again, my question is: if it possible for anxiety to feel “normal” and does anybody else feel this way as well?",24Dec2020,1

190,"Hello, you. 

It’s been a tough year hasn’t it? We’ve all got something on our minds... a family issue, friendship issue, relationships issue, a past mistake etc. Have you realised the amount of days you’ve punished yourself? You haven’t given yourself a break. People mess up, people fail, people make mistakes, people lose... it’s a part of life, we all go through them. 

Tomorrow, it’s Christmas Day. If you’re spending it with your family, friends or on your own, I want **YOU** to have a fantastic day. Give yourself a break for just a day, without feeling guilty of doing so. This year, you’ve been on your back from the first minute. You have refused to forgive yourself. I know how hard it is, I have many past regrets and mistakes, and to this day, I try and become the best version of myself. Some days, it’s hard, you know that feeling very well. But, that being said, we also need days when we get off our own backs, give yourself a hug, tell yourself that everything is going to be okay and enjoy the celebrations. 

My promise to you, if you **attempt** or **try** to forgive yourself, I will be there for you on Christmas Day. As I always say, the one thing I’m looking for in a person... effort. If tomorrow is the first day of the year you have found your smile, don’t lose it, spread it everywhere. No matter how you’re feeling or what’s going on in your life, if you can share any gifts, share your smile instead, that’s good enough for me. :) 

From myself, I wish you a very Merry Christmas and I hope you all have a terrific day. Spend is with the people you love and cherish each moment. If you’re in need of someone to talk to, my PM’s will be open throughout the whole day, just pop me a message and I’ll get back at you.

Thanks for reading everyone. Best wishes to you all!

Hi, I'm 20 years old, sometime around 3/4 years ago while I was still in high school, my personality seemed to start to change, my social anxiety got a lot worse, I also became very depressed but that seems to have mostly lifted (comes back sometimes but I'm mostly good). I'm kind of in my head all the time though, I avoid people, I can't really open up emotionally to anyone, I'm always hiding my actual self..

I haven't talked to (had a meaningful convo) with anyone in my family in a few years, and at this point I feel so estranged that I feel like I wouldn't even be able to have a natural conversation with them. I've mostly just been avoiding, my parents say that my brothers/grandparents/etc. ask where I've been/why I don't come over and see them and I can't really give an answer. There are some people I can still talk to normally, my boyfriend, a couple of my friends, etc..

I also just feel really lost in life, I have a car/job/friends and wanna go to college but last time I tried I was such an anxious mess I just skipped my public speaking class the entire semester cause I was too afraid to meet my advisor.. 

I'm also trans and get misgendered by my family a lot which hurts, I think I avoid people as well for this reason, I haven't fully come out to them yet though. I'm also somewhat dependent on weed, I can go without but I've tried quitting fully and it's hard, though I know I need to because it destroys my motivation and only further exacerbates my anxiety lol

I'm in between therapists currently but want to try being more honest with my next one. Like I can't even open up emotionally to my therapist.. so that's why I came here, if anyone has been in a similar situation and has any advice I would greatly appreciate it uwu

thanks",24Dec2020,1

I understand I should have communicated better with my mom, but at the same time, up until last week, I was scrambling to get my final assignments for the semester done and to get my graduate committee meeting done in time, and I wasn’t too focused on micromanaging the grocery orders.

It was my bodies way of looking after me the best it could when I was in absolute pieces and could not look after myself. It bore the weight for me of my depression, of my anxiety, of the horrible experiences I’ve had and the horrible people I’ve met when I could not.

It was all around not good for me and I felt like I tried to give him my whole world and I carried this whole relationship on my shoulders... basically I gave him more than I could receive from him.

i have trouble eating because i feel like people are poisoning my food or putting something in it.

207,"There‘s so many things I want to learn and understand, but my goddamn brain will not fucking let me do it no matter how much I try. It’s embarrassing and disgusting how hard I struggle to do things that others can do effortlessly. The fact I’ve spent a literal year trying to understand the definitions of basic words makes me wanna puke. I look up what words mean, don’t understand the words used in the definition, look up the meanings of those words, don’t understand those meanings, and so on and so forth. There’s no excuse for me being this fucking illiterate considering English is my native language. I can read and pronounce words perfectly, but cannot for the life of me understand them. It just sounds like fucking jibberish. When reading books, they all just look like someone ripped out words from the dictionary and randomly assorted them onto the pages. It’s all fucking incomprehensible, but others assure me that it makes sense and are able to summarize what they read. Either it’s an elaborate prank on me or I really am just that abysmally dense that I can’t understand anything. I’m basically a native alien.

I tried learning economics and couldn’t fucking do it. Too complicated. I even bought an economics book made for little kids out of shame and the terminology was still too far over my head. Simple words like “surplus,” “inflation,” “equilibrium,” “monetary,” etc. all sounded like nonsensical jargon to me. I reread what the words meant too many times to count, but my brain refuses to process any external information I read

I am extremely limited to what I can understand in life and it’s driving me batshit insane. Just yesterday, I was trying to learn about the concept of retrocausality and time travel because I thought it was interesting. Nothing I read about it made any damn sense to my addled brain. I tried coping by telling myself that maybe no one else understood this concept either. But after seeing just how many other people understood the topic and had made videos explaining it in detail, I couldn’t continue making excuses for my poor comprehension skills. 

I ask people for help, but none of their answers ever make sense to me. They just confuse me even more. I go to tutoring and study in my personal time, but still horribly flunk the test. I’ve been to psychologists and neurologists but none of them can say what the hell this nightmarish condition is. They all pretty much say the same thing: I am articulate and can speak like a normal, functioning adult but have the intellectual and processing capabilities of a 4-year-old (or a very elderly person going through dementia) I somehow failed the logic exam and abstract reasoning test. Can’t do mental math. Can’t judge distance and lack depth perception. I failed my drivers exam 3 times. I have no common sense and get humiliated all the time by people who know I have a track record of misinterpreting instructions and failing at everything. School says I’m too smart to be in special ed but too dumb to be in regular classes and don’t know where to place me. Thought about just entering the workforce but I’ve been fired from every job I’ve had because I misinterpreted instructions or broke equipment or fucked up majorly.   


Everyone except my parents is basically telling me that I’m not fit to work because I ruin everything I touch and I’m completely unteachable since I can’t understand explanations (whether through words, visuals, etc.) I really just wanna eat a fucking bullet right now. I cry every night and pray to God (if there even is one) that he will just let me kick the bucket already. This is barbarically cruel",24Dec2020,1
208,"Spoke about the below story in another group for my addiction and the bottom felt more like a mental health scenario. I can’t quite connect the dots. Any insight?

~~~~~~~

This morning was weird. I woke up so excited that I’ve almost made it 7 days on my truly first attempt of a PMO cleanse. I began rummaging through Twitter for news and stumble upon news of a celebrity leak scandal. 

My kryptonite. 

Without even thinking my fingers quickly scoured my sources to see what was available. No more than a minute, maybe two in, I caught myself thinking ‘what are you doing?’ I wasn’t even conscious of the behavior until I was already behind enemy lines. It didn’t take me long to exit out of the windows but before I did, I caught myself bargaining, ‘it’s not so bad if you look but don’t masturbate, right?’ 

Recognizing that thought is what stopped the action because it took all the joy out of it. ‘Why even look then?’ I thought. Part of me said, ‘exactly! You’re not hurting anyone go ahead and please yourself.’ I didn’t. I didn’t want to. I felt I was being invasive. For the first time in my life, I somehow managed to put myself in the shoes of the individual that was exposed and stopped.

Which is even weirder, because voyeurism is one of my kinks. 

I don’t really know what’s happening with me and I’m not really concerned. I’m sorry if I’m over sharing in this group. A lot of my life I’ve had nobody to talk to about my feelings and what I go through or have gone through. I could write in my journal and I’m sure I’ll slowly shift that direction but right now, knowing that someone might read this and it might resonate with, or even help someone is something I need. Especially because it’s Christmas Eve and I’ve been completely alone since last Saturday and I’ll be completely alone for the next two weeks. 

I used to flaunt about my ability to be alone and that I needed nobody. Now, I’m starting to realize that was only my way of survival because my family had neglected me my entire life. In that, I think it might be time for me to admit I like people and want people in my life. This might not be for here and again I’m sorry.

211,"I have a bizarre behaviour: in the past ten years, I have ruined if not destroyed six laptops through incompetent attempts to repair or upgrade components when I clearly don't have the skill or ability to do so competently. I don't understand why I keep trying to repair things I don't know how to repair when I've repeatedly destroyed what I was trying to fix.

My first laptop was 15.4 inch machine in high school and it served me well until the screen went dead. 

In university, my father gave me a beautiful 12 inch laptop for my education. One of the keys was sticking and I popped it loose, but broke the clip. I tried to superglue the key back on and the key would no longer depress. I now had a laptop without a working K key and having purchased the laptop overseas, it wasn't possible to repair it. I had never replaced a keyboard key before, didn't know what I was doing -- yet thought I could handle this task myself.

After university, during a dire financial stage, I was using a $200 netbook with a nine inch screen. It was adequate for my desperate job applications and email, but it creaked when I typed and I felt embarrassed to use it in public. I thought I could open up the netbook and add some internal cushioning, but I broke all the clips and I couldn't reassemble the machine.

Thankfully, my job applications before destroying my own computer were successful and I bought an adequate 14 inch laptop with a peculiar bronze colour. It served me well for two years, then I accidentally chipped the corner of the back of the screen. I became obsessed with 'fixing' it and spray painted the back of the laptop, but also drenched the entire machine in spray paint and ruined it.

My next laptop was a beautiful 13 inch machine with bronze colouring and silver accents. One of the side panels was a bit loose, however, with a gap from the keyboard. I tried to superglue it shut but instead got the glue all over the keyboard, rendering it unusable.

After that, I was on a little 10 inch laptop. Some of the stickers on the front were peeling and looked unsightly, but I couldn't get all the adhesive off. I applied some acetone to weaken the glue and it also melted the keyboard.

After that, I was on an 11.6 laptop. I somehow broke the screen (don't remember how) but found a local repair shop that did screen replacements. Finding this repair shop ended my run of incompetent repairs for which I was untrained and wholly inept. They would handle my screen replacements, my hard drive replacements, my hinge repairs. And yet...

A few years ago, I spent a good sum on a gaming laptop so that I would have all the computing power I could possibly need. I wanted to upgrade the RAM from 8GB to 32GB and to replace the spinning hard drives with solid state memory. I carefully watched YouTube disassembly videos and my upgrades on this were successful.

Recently, my office switched us to working from home. I felt that my productivity would be aided by a small laptop that I could carry around the house to keep work with me if I walked away from my gaming laptop (which I use as a desktop and is too cumbersome to carry around). I had received a small stipend from work to buy a nice little discounted to $200 11.6 laptop that would be an adequate work machine that I would be permitted to keep.

It was lovely, but the screen had lousy viewing angles and was a little desaturated. I decided to replace the screen myself, taking the excellent display out of an old Chromebook that had proven inadequate (but undestroyed!) to put in this 11.6 inch laptop instead.

I cracked the hinge on my new work-covered laptop and broke it because I am not a hardware repair technician and do not know what I'm doing and should not be attempting this. I have no idea why I kept trying or why I keep trying now. I also realized that this $200 laptop had really not been built to have its parts swapped in and out; the casing was held in place with clips that weren't meant to be opened without permanently breaking them.

Embarrassed and ashamed, I quietly replaced the work-covered laptop with an identical model with my own money and have now spent $400 on a $200 machine.

Also, after some calibration, the screen was fine and an 11.6 laptop doesn't need great viewing angles.

Something is really wrong with me. I'm a smart guy and I can solve a lot of problems in other areas and people at work always come to me for solutions and I'm great with software. But it should have been clear after the acetone incident: I do not know how to repair hardware and have no business trying to do so without proper training and instruction. There's also the fact that in every instruction video I saw, the people trying to replace the screen on my model break the hinge.

I think maybe, as a kid, my parents had money, but they refused to spend it on me for items they'd consider aesthetic and I'd go to school and be the boy in ugly and torn tracksuits. Classmates would make fun of me for being poor when I wasn't. Then I got my laptop and brought it to school and people admired it in my mind and stopped calling me poor. This was in the early 2000s when most high schoolers were still on desktops. 

Since then, I've had a compulsive need to have a light laptop that I can take out in public (I guess?). 

I've never had a laptop that would be a considered a status symbol with laptops becoming common and my laptops don't even qualify as ultrabooks, but I had a terror of having a laptop that could embarrass me with a chipped corner or glue residue on the palmrest or a slightly imperfect screen because it made me feel like someone who couldn't afford better or couldn't take care of his belongings. 

As a status symbol, a laptop is a dated item to latch onto when the most prominent gadget we have today is a smartphone.

Oddly, this fixation on laptops is not found elsewhere in my behaviours. I have a state of the art smartphone from 2016 and I just had the battery replaced so it can hopefully go another four years. I drive a car that's from 2002 and always let my mechanic handle all the work I'm not qualified to do. 

I don't know why I am so unwilling to stop myself from attempting repairs and upgrades when my track record has been disastrous and the fact that I didn't destroy my gaming laptop putting in the RAM and new hard drives is a minor miracle and was clearly a source of false confidence.

There's also the false perception of a bargain: I think I'll buy this cheap laptop and upgrade the screen and some internal components myself and that'll be cheaper than simply buying a laptop with the screen and internals that I'd actually want in the first place. That's also been pretty destructive and expensive with my cheap, destroyed machines forcing me to buy another cheap machine that will soon also be destroyed.

I think I need to remind myself the next time I'm buying a computer:

Your laptop does not define your identity. If you need a laptop to define your identity, you don't have an identity.

If you want specific components or features or aesthetics, choose a machine that has them: don't think that you can buy something inexpensive and add those aspects yourself.

You are gifted in many areas: hardware repair and upgrades is not one of them.

The money you 'save' on buying a cheaper machine is lost when you destroy it in an attempt to improve it using skills that you do not possess in a field where you have no training.

You have a reliable repair and upgrade service that can advise you in what upgrades are and aren't possible and perform the work with experience and the proper equipment.

If you wanted an 11.6 inch laptop with a matte screen and great viewing angles, then you should have spent the extra money to buy it instead of spending the extra money to buy hardware you didn't love two times over for God's sake stop DOING THIS.",24Dec2020,1

But finally I can say I’m happy.

Been dealing for 8 years with major depression, there was one time 3.5 years ago that I’m still asking myself how I’m alive. Almost 4 years and I don’t know how I survived.

Last week was my closest one to that day. 16 cuts around my body, wherever I found a vein, there’s a cut. Some will fade away some will stay longer.

I’m from Latin America, any mental health disorders are considered weaknesses, specially if you’re a male like me, you’re considered a crybaby. Looking for help is tough, you will be judged right away.

Fighting alone, you can’t imagine how is fight with yourself, you’re your own enemy.

Long story short. Last week got into a fight with my wife (verbally and because I grabbed her, physical). We both been dealing it with same mental health issues, 2 very depressed humans without the proper help, was a very toxic relationship, for both of us.
A friend of her made a call and police showed up that night to pick me up (fight was in the morning), went to detention a released within a hour or 2, first time i been arrested, first time seeing real cuffs, beside the pink fluffy one at home, first time I’ve ever seen a prison, first time inside a police car, first time behind the bars... I don’t even have a speed ticket... but the desperation and frustration for being ignored by my own wife, got me mad. My biggest mistake was I thought she could help me, but I was totally wrong, not her fault, she’s a great woman, but for the best of us, soon my ex.

After being released around midnight with the condition to show up in court the day after and can’t go back home, contact her, etc.. in the middle of the night, New England’s winter night, cold. I went to the first place I found, cheap ass crapy motel in the border of the city.  From my top floor city view downtown apartment, to a place I didn’t know if the sheets were clean. My case was a misdemeanor charge, no fines or bond was even charged. But the desperation and thinking going back to jail, and my depression at top, I started to play with razors blades, lets keep it that way.

I quit my job recently because the stress was so much and decided to take December off, my bonus was good enough to pay my rent and bills till march, so that was not a problem, but staying at home, was.

During my “playing time” I just sent her, a good bye text, and leaving her all the passwords of our accounts, etc... just to not make it more difficult for her after I was gone. Because of that I broke my conditional release and now is a felony, and the police went for me again, trying to find me to take me back to custody and make sure I went to the court. Thanks, whoever you believe, they found me, and took me to the hospital. Again, because i broke my conditional i have to stay in custody till I show up in court, means the week i was at the hospital, was cuffed to the bed. One week, 24/7, same clothes, no shower, blood still in my clothes.... 

But trust me when I tell you, was the happiest day of my life. For the first time I felt that someone was really carried about me, I felt safe...(there was two more attempts in the hospital, stuck my head inside of the toilet while in a second that the nurse got distracted, damn toilet flushed, now i have to remember that forever, they noticed right away, took me back to the bed gave me couple paper towels to dry my face, I kept one of the and tried to chock myself with it, they noticed again...)... and for the first time i was brave enough to talk... have you seen doctors and nurses crying while you tell them your stories?... 

I cried a lot, you can add all the cries when I was a baby + any cry during my 32 years, not even close to what I cried during my time in the hospital... but that is what I needed, I took out all that poison out of me, as I said, i was feeling SAFE, every single person at the Yale New Haven Hospital made me feel safe, for the first time I felt i wasn’t fighting alone, like there’s real help outside, real people who take care of you and can help you, for the first time I felt there is another exit, a better exit, a one that you don’t walk alone.

Got the strength to talk about my problem, to face what i was doing wrong, what I stopped doing become the darkness and who I was affecting the people who loves me and around me.
 
The doctors and police officer couldn’t believe how someone was so happy cuffed in a bed for so long. 

After the  hospital I went straight to custody again and then transferred to the court, a temporary restriction order was placed, and have to appear to the court again February first. No bond was charged. 

Was released with a pta, went back “to my home” with a police escort to grab my stuff, didn’t found the luggages, so everything went into trash bags, grab my dog, she kept the car and apartment, and i was there just homeless for long couple hours, my dog and 3 trash bags...... but the most happy man alive. For the first time I was feeling FREE. 

I talked with my brother after 20 years, I talked with my dad after 7, my old friends after 4.

Getting divorced, my green card application was marriage base, will be withdrawn. So probably facing deportation (add that i have a court case now)

All of this in just one week.

I found a place, I’m safe, im happy, I’m with my dog.

Im just telling you part of my story just to let you know you’re not alone, there’s a lot shit during our way and we will step on it, clean it up and keep walking my buddy, trust me, there’s an exit, another one, not the fake one we want to use, have cojones to talk about it, go by yourself to the hospital, don’t make the same mistake as me, go and cry like a baby, you can’t imagine how nice you will feel.

If you need someone to talk to, you can be from Mars, and feel free to message me, google translate will help with.

Your friend, Eduardo.",24Dec2020,1
213,"I was with my ex for about a year, I never realized How toxic he is, or how abusive. Before I knew it, I had no friends cause he was everything. I barely was at home cause he was everything for me.

I loved taking care of him, made me feel important. Needed. I'd buy food and drink for him all the time. I'd buy weed. I'd drive him everywhere as he doesn't drive. I'd clean his apartment cause he doesn't.

I had to walk on eggshells because anything I said could set him off and he would kick me out.

He's cheated on me with his ex because I'm ""too big for sex"" that broke my heart and brought me down to a fat zero self esteem all over.

This last time, I hung out with friends and we got drunk. I messaged him asking if I can crash there as I can't drive, he said yes. I come over, and clear a spot on the ground to sit. While I'm clearing some stuff, may as well clean a bit more. He lost his shit when I was cleaning.

He slammed his computer mouse and broke it yelling at me. Told me I had to leave and take everything I had there or he would chuck it. I had a good few Christmas gifts I was storing there, few different bags and whatnot. It was after midnight and I'm drunk in a sketchy neighbourhood known for stabbings and mugging and whatnot. He tells me to start walking anyway, no care.

I miss the cat I got him so much it hurts.
And I miss talking to him everyday

Even writing this out, it's obvious he's abusive and manipulative and there's no reason I should miss him... But I do.

215,"I’m thinking about starting a YouTube channel. It will be for a tips and tricks guide channel for a popular video game.

I’ve been at a roadblock for a while. I’ve seen other people in this games competitive scenes Twitter and I see that they post SAT scores where they place Top 1 percent in the nation. I feel like dog shit compared to them and I feel like a fraud.

Another instance is when I criticized someone for something they did and they just sent me a bunch of medals they earned at another game. LAN tournaments too. I feel like I’ll never amount to anything if that’s the type of people that i come acrossed.

I then look at other people doing the same tho g I do. They have way better hardware. Have a huge following. They are buddy buddy with developers and I feel like it’s so fucking unfair and that I’m just an unknown piece of shit.

Ever since I started playing this game I’ve tried my best and got pretty good. I tried to go competitive but I didn’t really get far. I was limited in my hardware and was passed up by a lot of teams because I wasn’t known and they thought I hacked because I was new and doing well. I just got tossed aside.

I’m thinking about shifting my focus on content creation but I just feel like a nobody. I’ve played this game for almost 4 years and I’ve been very high ranked but I feel like a fucking fraud. I don’t know what to do. 

I also catch myself making multiple accounts, trying to start a new slate in the discord server but I ALWAYS find myself criticizing people. Starting issues. Starting drama. I don’t know what to do.

I am without a doubt hypersexual. I have started to impulsively talk about sexual things and struggle to remove thoughts about some seriously harsh fetishes from my head. It has become debilitating and potentially problematic. It stems from relationship trauma and porn addiction I had as a very young teen.

I've had therapy for a long time about it but the cycle has actually gotten much much worse. I need help right now. For anyone else who has checked themselves into a UK mental hospital, will they be able to help me and what should I expect?

218,"Everyday we start Anew. Everyday is a new start to do something you wanted to yesterday. Its taking 1 step at a time and releasing the thought of finishing whatever it may be you want to work towards. The journey of life is through the ups, through the downs and everything in between; what we have, is our perspective, our mindset and our presence. 

**The past few years** have been **rocky**, moving to a new city, starting life over, having to move out suddenly, change my life again which was all unexpected. Then, Covid, unexpected, then forcing me into solitude to sit with myself. Sit in my alcohol abuse/drug abuse and allow it to unravel, release and unlearn. Then; coming to terms with my identity and acknowledging that I am **Trans**, which at first was filled with happiness but as well as shame, doubt, sadness, pain &amp; joy.

We as human beings all live lives as waves. There are moments that can be very hard and make us feel the worst, as well as moments that bring us happiness and joy from the smallest of things. The journey of life is a process, it has to be this way, everything. Without the lows, we would never know when we are happy, without the highs, we would never know when we are feeling down and know that something must be changed. The life lived with feeling all emotions is such a unique perspective, it allows us to know that we are human beings and we are **ALIVE.**

We all are hurting. We all are in pain. We all are just trying to figure ourselves out. We all are feeling all the feels. We all have moments of gratitude. We all have moments of happiness. We all have moments of presence. 

Sitting in your feelings, sitting in your pain, is such a strength. It has taken me time, through the constant self induced numbing, defence mindset and saying ""i'm ok"", when really I wasn't &amp; thats ok. I am still learning who I am everyday. I am still feeling pain, sadness and all the feels, everyday. 

I want to say that, **I LOVE YOU &amp;** I know things may be **TOUGH** right now, but I know that if you are reading this, if you realize it or not, **YOU ARE TRYING &amp; YOU ARE HEALING. WE ALL ARE. I wish you well.**

She has been self harming for 2 years and do it every other day, i don't know exactly how she do it but i think it's not enough to make her bleed because she told me that she bleed because she did it a lot of times in one day and ""stupidly"" (in her words) did it in the same arm, she self harms the thighs too, also the reason, she said it is a copying mechanism for stress 

I don't know if i should give her space, i don't know if i'm overreacting, i don't know if i'm bothering her too much (i send her like 30 messages every hour) don't know if she might be depressed, suicidal, i deeply care about her and this is honestly so exhausting, not knowing how she is, if she's ok, she doesn't tell me anything, please help

224,"I have friends and family, even the occasional person I talk to online for support, but I feel so completely alone anyway. It's just impossible for me to take to heart anything anyone tells me when that person is in a relationship, can date at any time, etc. I just truly believe that many people have no idea what it's like, at least in any first world country, to go for years on end without even meeting new people let alone dating, being in a relationship, or experiencing the closeness of any kind of intimacy.  

On one hand, I know I'm the source of my own problems: I'm a fish out of water when it comes to dating (or trying to) and I self sabotage a bit to protect myself; but there are so many things out of my control and I think that's what I struggle with the most.  I feel like this day and age of instant gratification, window shopping for dates based on the most superficial standards, the necessity for sexual confidence (much less experience) and sex appeal before or at least as much as anything else. It's all so daunting and so foreign to me. 

It's become too much to handle -- that never even making it to a first date let alone someone giving me the chance to be together long enough to figure out whether it will actually work or in the meantime at least trying to connect through emotional if not physical intimacy -- that I feel left with nothing but this extreme dichotomy between completely isolating myself (even more than current times require) in the ultimate move to be as avoidant as possible or taking a huge risk by choosing to be with absolutely anyone no matter how terrible they are for me or how unattracted to them (not just physically) I am. The latter is a path I've been down a few times in the distant path and it's hard to remember sometimes the damage that was caused. 

I just keep reinforcing in my head that it's too late for me, that I'll never catch up, that I'm too weird and too far removed from what people look for and go for in dating these days. And my evidence for that, however sparse, is very strong. And now, the true winter of isolation upon us all, I think that even if I make it through to spring, I truly have no hope for when things turn around socially and events and activities happen where people can meet. I think many people will have success, find love, find relationships, engage in dating, and none of it will matter for me. 

I just can't shake the feeling of hopelessness, made worse by my own mind convincing me that the only way I'll find what I'm looking for is that special person to simply appear or of nowhere, choosing me before I have a chance to even think about choosing her; and that if that fantasy can't happen, then there really is no hope for because doing things the ""normal"" way and putting myself out there at all will always inevitably fail and the being vulnerable will always have been for nothing.",24Dec2020,1
225,"First time posting &amp; on mobile, sorry in advance for errors 
2020 has easily been one of if not the hardest year of my life. January I started dating a guy that I thought was good for me, we dated for 7 months through the pandemic, and in that time:
- my depression got worse again
- quarantine started (can’t leave the house because of family)
- my best friend died
- all of my friends were banned from seeing me in person and he was the only person allowed over 
- he made a comment about my weight one day and with all of the other emotional burden happening turned into an eating disorder
In all of this, he stopped supporting me at all, was emotionally neglectful and put 0% into the relationship after month 2, leaving me worrying more about it than myself and my mental health. Also, when he broke up with me, he used my deteriorating mental health as one of the reasons. 

Through this time, I met my best friend joe (name redacted). Joe and I immediately clicked as people, and met through mutual friends but do not live in the same state. He’s currently in another country for 2 years abroad, and I found out recently that he shares the romantic feelings I feel towards him. I don’t like the idea of a long distance relationship across an ocean, so we’ve agreed to just be friends for now. 
Since that news, 2 more of my family members have died, which has put my mental health in a slightly worse spot because I feel that I need to support my family who knew these people better than I did. One of my other friends, John (name redacted) has expressed feelings for me. John also has mental health problems and has had them worsen too over this year. He lives in state but 3 hours away, and I can not see myself sustaining a long term relationship with him, despite his efforts to be there for me during my struggles, and attempts to be positive for me. I fear that by telling John my true feelings he will hurt himself or someone else (he’s mentioned a past flame hurting him and it clearly has had an impact on him because I’m the only other person he’s been interested in), and the friendship and trust I have put in him will be ruined. I’ve expressed part of this to him and all he tells me is that he‘ll wait, which adds a further burden to me.  I don’t think I’m in the space to endure another romantic relationship of any kind, especially after all of the trauma I have experienced this year.

A while ago I found out that for suicide survivors and those who used to self harm, the ; represents that you could have ended your life but you didn’t. 

I really want to get the “;” but in the form of jewelry but I feel like I may not be qualified for it.

Ever since elementary school, I’ve had a pretty rough life (bullied from elementary to middle school) I’ve found a lot of unpleasant and soul crushing truths about the people around me and my parents and that has taken a drastic toll on me. I, since middle school, have had suicidal thoughts come and go when I am going through hard times. The reason I feel like I don’t deserve to have this tattoo is, if I’m being honest, I haven’t as hard as a time as other people have. I haven’t self harmed or taken my life but I have had the realization that I can just end my life right here and now if I wanted to and there’s no real barrier that’s keeping me away from doing it.  

I have also had the realization that if I had a relationship and it was toxic, I totally would not have seen the warning signs or that the person was toxic at all and I’m grateful I’ve never been in a romantic relationship but also terrified and sad that someone could have so much power over me but I’d be unable to see through that. 

I still don’t know if that’s enough to have this ; in the form of jewelry. I don’t want to try and be something I’m not and I don’t want to claim I have something when I don’t because I know how hard life is for those who have gone through suicide attempts and self harm before. 

So my question would be, am I qualified or have been hit hard enough by life to get this tattoo but in the form of jewelry? Or is my case not serious enough to get it?",24Dec2020,1

229,"Hello,

So its been a rough year for everyone. I know everybody is going through such a rough time. I know it's been such a horrible year and I hope everybody is having a better Christmas.

 But I like to get a few things off my chest. In November, before Thanksgiving, my aunt passed away and she was one of my favorite people on this planet. Her death hit me so hard.

 She was the kind of person who did all that she could for anybody and never expected anything back. She was amazing, a great listener, a great comforter.  She would always call me everyday or send me a text just check in and tell me about her day.

 And now I don't get that. There's no text and that's so hard.

 It's so hard to accept. We would always have Thanksgiving at her house but after her passing we couldn't.  It wasn't even Thanksgiving. It was just a quiet day. She had a really bad heart and had to have a couple of stints in and her lungs were starting to give out on her. 

 It was very difficult for her to breathe. It got very bad at the end, like so bad that she didn't even look like herself. She looked so different it was so hard to see her and now it's Christmas.

 We would always have Christmas at her house too but since everything is happening and because of her passing there's no Christmas.

 I am pretty much alone this Christmas. It's so quiet and so lonely. I know I could call somebody, talk to a friend or something but it's Christmas and I don't want to ruin it for them.
 If they're having a good time I want them to have a good time. I don't want to bring anybody down because people need a good day with everything going on in the world. 
I know I'm not the only one alone for Christmas. 
I know there's so much worse but I hope it's not like that for everyone.

 I hope that they are having a good Christmas. I hope it's a wonderful intro to  the next year.
 
To all this Christmas, you are not alone. You are loved and amazing. Stay strong!

 So everybody, please take care of yourselves. Make some delicious treat and snuggle with a warm blanket.  Listen, watch or read one of your favorites. Or a few and thank you for reading. I wish you all the best!",24Dec2020,1
230,"I have a friend (25+) who is Ill. She is very hyper, sleeps around 5 hours at most, hallucinates and says people are spying on her.

This has happened a few times before and I don't know what triggered it again. She hasn't been treated for anything, hasn't been to the doctor. Nothing. She doesn't think anything is wrong with her.

I don't know what to do as her friend. Her family don't know what to do either. She's clearly not well and we don't want her to get worse. The pandemic doesn't help anything either.

Any advice from people who have been through something similar would be appreciated. Thank-you.",24Dec2020,1
231,"Recently, i haven’t been doing the greatest mentally, ive had a lot of internal conflict and conflict with my friends. Its just lately i feel like they dont care about me, even though they say they do. I really wanna trust and believe them when they say this, but a lot of experiences in my life have messed up my trust, and im not used to people even caring about me. This isnt the first time ive acted like this either, i opened up before and it blew up in my face. Now, i opened up again and the same thing happened. I feel really needy because im in constant need of reassurance, and i cant stop overthinking and getting the wrong ideas about things. Im distancing myself from them currently to get right mentally, but i have no clue what to do and i feel lost. Specifically one of my friends has gotten really mad at me these past times when i opened up, they just say they dont want to deal with and and are tired of it. It really gets to my head and makes me think that they dont care about me even more. But i know its because of their own experiences in life, but now im too scared to even talk to them. I feel like i dont make them happy anymore, and i wanna fix things but i have to fix myself first. I think if i go back and cause problems again i’ll just have to leave the whole group, because im clearly the problem. Im ruining their happiness at a time like this. I just feel so lost.",24Dec2020,1

I’ve never been in a relationship, and it’s not like I necessarily have a desire to be around anyone. My voice is also monotone, but I am able to understand emotions.

When I’m alone, I like to listen to music through ear phones and pace around, while daydreaming, it feels like the only thing that gets me excited.",24Dec2020,1

237,"I can already tell this is going to be a really long mess of jumbled words but maybe it will help a little. I just feel like I need to tell my story and talk about what I am going through currently.  I grew up in a family where a large portion of my family struggled with mental health, including both my mother and father. It was especially bad when I was about 13 and my little brother was 10. With both my parents struggling I was often the emotional support for my little brother, and that carried on into being the emotional support for my mom too. Then, my two closest friends both had their own struggles to. My best friend stopped talking to me for six months and then when she reached out again she relied on my very heavily for motivation and support in day to day life. Now don't get me wrong, I love this friend so so much but I have always felt like I am giving and supporting so much but without much support myself. And slowly my other closest friend started crumbling away too and now we rarely talk or see one another. Throughout all that time I thought I was fine and I was handling everything super well. 

But now, when I look back I realize that for a super long time all I can remember feeling is detached. Sometimes it truly feels like my brain is so far away from my body and I am just barely grasping on to things happening or going on. And then recently I moved out on my own into an apartment with a friend. I now live 100 miles away from my hometown where all of my family and people I know are. My roommate is one of the very few people I know here. It has been hard to move away in the middle of a pandemic and experience being on my own for the first time. I think that has somewhat of a factor into what feels like a big change in my mental health recently. 

Lately it feels like I am either bubbling with anxiety so much that my lungs burn, I am crying for a reason I don't even know, or I am just detached. And then for some reason my brain just told me all the sudden I needed to cut myself. I know that my brain is me and it doesn't make sense but against all my reasoning and logic--knowing that it isn't a good solution--something in my brain was just screaming at me to cut. And I really tried to get the thought out of my head and reason myself out of it but I was apparently unable to do that because I cut for the first time and my brain won't stop telling me I need to. 

I've never been to therapy or seen a psychologist. I have always been the person that people rely on when they are struggling and I don't know if this makes sense but...I don't know how to be the person who *is* struggling. I don't want to go to anyone because I know they are already struggling with their own stuff and I don't want to increase their issues. And I feel dumb for wanting to cut because I don't have any big reason to feel this way ya know? I don't have trauma or any reason like other people do and I know I shouldn't compare myself but it is what my brain does. There is just the burning feeling in my chest and gut that screams at me to do it and I really really don't understand.

Anyways...I don't know what is happening and it is scary and it is lonely. Maybe someone can relate. Thanks for letting me vent.",24Dec2020,1
238,"I will either pace around my house, lay in my bed, or sit on a chair and live in my head for hours. It’s not that I’m lazy or don’t know what to do, but I simply clock out because I guess everything seems pointless?. When I snap out of this I’m filled with immense dread as 1/4 of my day was completely wasted. I try to make up for it as I’m not this indolent 100% of the time, but it happens enough to hold me back in the things I love(yes I do have passion, there’s no absence of that, I just mentally disappear). I looked this up and the term “Avolition”  came up as a symptom of schizophrenia. I was diagnosed with BPD and OCD years ago (and depression/anxiety as symptoms of these&lt;—) but that’s it. When I zone i do have fake conversations in my head with people I know and am close too, or like celebrities, but I know that these are fake and I feel like these are common, because everyone lives in a ‘perfect’ world in their head mental illness or not.

And it doesn't matter how much i tried to rationalize it i still feel like and idiot and have been nervous the whole day and don't want to think about it. I swear to god it's really stupid but for some reason i can't stop thinking the worst and i'm worried that everytime i make a decision that i want to make it'll be this overwhelming 'cause i don't have the energy to deal with this. Also I wasn't diagnosed with anxiety or anything like that, i'm not one to worry about things, i'm always chill and struggle with having any intense emotion but this is stressful.",24Dec2020,1
240,"  So lately I have been in a bad place, I felt like nothing good was going to happen. But soon everything figured it out by itself and I became ok.  I wanted to wright this because when I feel like this I sometimes don’t tell anyone and suffer alone, and sometimes I tell everyone and get upset that I did that. When I feel like crap, sometimes I just need someone to tell me I’m ok...

If we never got sad, we would never appreciate when we were happy. Even though being sad sucks, sometimes it teaches us a lesson either it being from, who is are friend, to making us see what we did wrong, or figuring out who we are!

Everything happiness for a reason even if it doesn’t seem like it, and sometimes it happiness to teach us a lesson some longer than others. Ik when I’m sad I push ppl alway and it’s not that I’m trying to be mean it’s more that I feel like if I push them away I don’t have to think ab it, or I don’t have to see ppl being happy when I’m not. Yes, sometimes taking a break from ppl helps but not all the time.

I’m an extreme over thinker, sometimes what helps me come down is asking the person I’m overthinking ab or the thing, but sometimes I regret it, or the answer they gave me isn’t what I hoped for so sometimes I have to ask myself “who told me?” Or if u ever had an experience with someone who turned out you’re thoughts were true try to compare them and see (this might not work but it helps me cuz most of the time it’s all in my head) also if you’re saying “what if” know if u did do something u would know, so if u think u did anything u would know if u did and if u ask you’re “but did I?” Or “what if?” Then u didn’t.

But if this is about a friend Ik sometimes it’s hard to come to terms with the fact you might be growing apart but remember, not everyone Is supposed to stay in you’re life. Some ppl are their for shorter than others, and they teach u a lesson maybe it’s showing u that they weren’t good friends, or showing u that u were the bad friend. Ik sometimes u want them to stay and you’re life and rlly don’t want them to leave but don’t force it if it’s meant to be it will be, and if it’s not don’t force someone who doesn’t want to be in you’re life cuz it will hurt u in the end.

If it’s feeling like you’re not worth it listan to me, YOU ARE! You are gorgeous! Or handsome and if anyone says other wise their just jealous! You’re always worth it! Don’t forget about that no matter what happens, or who says other wise. Everyone is different, and that makes u unique! And unique is amazing! 

Ik sometimes things are harder said than done but remember life has so many ups and downs but that’s what makes life, life! In 5 years u won’t care so take 5min and be sad but then pick up you’re head bcs you’re crown is falling:) PLZ STAY! And if you’re thinking about not staying plz dm me I won’t judge sometimes u need someone to talk! And if u need someone to talk about ANYTHING! No matter what plz PLZ dm me, I’m so proud of each and everyone of u who’s reading this! Keep fighting!",24Dec2020,1
241,"I've been living a worthless life, just a vessel for consumption. I'm 17 and I feel like I'm living the twilight years of a life I never got to live. I have no school, no job, no education past 14, you'd be surprised how much I don't know.  

I have a severe problem with concentration, I get these constant build ups of energy I just can't let out in a focused outlet. I've dealt with it for years, it's cost me any chance I had at going to college. My supporters at junior high didn't know what to do with me. I'm on the autism spectrum - I hate myself for it. No matter how hard I try, I'll never get to be normal. 

I feel like a normal person trapped in the mind of this autistic prick. Even the people in society who try to help make me feel alienated, always exercising the pecking order of normal people and 'autists'. I was in the special needs area of my school. It was humiliating. All I think of when I see the NHS is a cabal of middle aged white people deciding how happy I'll get to be, none of them thinking for a single fucking moment they don't know what's best for me. All those years wasted in the common area, everyone just trying to keep me 'calm'.   

I used to be creative, a talented writer, now when I try to do something creative it's pathetically derivative. I used to write little parody news articles when I was 13. People said I could do it professionally, imagining a socially inept autistic writing savant. I can't just be good at something, can I? Whatever I show interest in something it must be all I think about, my 'special interest'. If you even think of me differently than any other person because I had a few surface level habits which put me on a spectrum with people who can't eat independently; fuck you

I'm also trans. yay. I'm terrified of telling anyone - I'd be perfectly safe, it's just after all the humiliation and anxiety I just can't handle exposing an identity so different from my current self. I feel constant dysphoria, I want to claw my way out of my own skin.

I was suicidal for a few months. My mum and social workers called back and forth deciding what to do to help me, there solution? Ban me from all electronics and going out of the house unattended for six months. Fuckin' ***G E N I U S.*** 

I just wish I didn't have to wake up. 

I suppose I've learned one thing; In a societal sense, I care about a person's autonomy above all else - a person's ability to think and determine for themselves. And how fucked up it is for other people to undermine that core human trait.",24Dec2020,1

That I simply can’t sleep unless I go and make my self a sandwich (or two) and few chocolate snacks, eat it on my bed and fall asleep right away. Here’s an even stranger thing, when I diet I force my self to sleep without food (which causes me to have insomnia btw) I fu**ing start to sleep walk to the kitchen around 3am to eat something!! Sometimes I don’t remember doing it until way later and sometimes it feels like a dream I had. I can’t tell if I’m awake or actually asleep doing this but it’s odd. Why..why is this happening!!?

eat food

play games

we wouldn't have to name things

or number things

or have language

or make things

or learn new things

we would just be

why even be in the first place

why does the universe exist

sure it's a random chance that we appeared

but what governs the universe even starting

has the world always been

and will always be

why is it called black

I wanted to call the samaritans but since it was Christmas Eve, all the lines were busy. I wanted to wait but I couldn’t wait any longer. I couldn’t stop crying and I just wanted to be held and told that I’m loved and that everything will be okay. I was forced to text a coworker of mine and now I’m regretting it abit because nothing much was done.

254,"So this is a bit of a long one but if anyone could give any suggestions I’d be very grateful. So basically I’m very worried about my brother and his mental health. Ever since he left school at 16 he hasn’t done anything, no work and no education. He doesn’t claim jobseekers so he’s spent nearly 5 years with no money, pretty much isolated in his room, not really talking to anyone. He used to speak to his friends quite a lot but in the last couple years he’s completely isolated himself. Of course we all try to speak to him but as soon as anyone mentions a job or anything he just instantly tells us to go away. Every now and then he’ll be in a good mood, and that’s about the only time we can really talk to him. We live in the same house and I maybe see him once a week. Something happened about an hour ago and I really think he needs some sort of help. He turns 21 in a few days so I think that’s stressing him out a bit. Basically some close friends of his that he hasn’t spoke to in a while, showed up at our house and pretty much invited themselves in(partially my other brothers fault, I tried to tell them not too as I knew it would end badly) they ending up going in his room whilst he was asleep and jumping on him. He got mad and smashed his whole room up and really hurt his hand. I’ve never seen him like that before, I was trying to calm him down and he was saying things like ‘no one understands’ ‘why do people think they can do what they want’ ‘I just wish everyone would leave me alone’. He really broke down and it was painful to see, but it definitely opened my eyes to how much he’s suffering with his mental health. No one in my family quite knows what to do, he definitely needs some sort of therapy or something but we can’t make him go. We just feel like we’re making it worse. Right now he’s in the bathroom shouting at my mum, saying ‘everyone just needs to fucking leave me alone, for the rest of my fucking life’. Just really don’t know what to do. Really worried he will do something bad. If anyone has any suggestions that would be really great, thanks",24Dec2020,1
255,"Lately I've been feeling haunted by my past. More specifically someone I used to be in love with. It's been almost 3 years since we broke up. We had a great relationship (lasting about 2ish years) until it started becoming mutually toxic for the two of us. I was busy with school, often times too tired or too stressed to do anything. They were trying all these sorts of activities through her school, making less time for us. It was a mess for scheduling and it really strained the relationship, basically pitting us against each other. They wanted a break to let things settle and I complied for a while. Through mutual friends, I found out they had been flirtatious and implicit with other people during the break. I couldn't handle that so I took the initiative and dumped them. But that's beside the point. 

And it's not like I've been sulking and stuff. I've been doing good things for me. Doing good in school (about to graduate and brought my GPA up more than 0.50 points), making new friends and reconnecting with old ones, treating my body better, and going to therapy to really focusing on my mental health. 

I've gone on dates here and there, had some fun times with some people, but no real connection like in that relationship. I don't mind being single, I'm even glad for it since I got my life together. I just feel haunted by them. They pop into my head at random times, typically unsolicited. Memories, dreams, flashes. I sometimes feel like I'm losing my mind. It's driving me up the wall and I want it to go away. 

I don't know. It feels like it shouldn't be like this after so long and it usually isn't. I would like to think I'm rather happy go lucky normally but lately this has been creeping into my mind, really nagging at it. Maybe it's because my other friends are happy with their partners and it make me subtly jealous or long for what I once had. Who knows? World's weird I suppose.",24Dec2020,1

Resources: If you are unable to seek help from a professional or too nervous at this time, below are resources that should guide the healing process.   Remember there is nothing wrong with going to therapy!   

Feeling Good by David Burns: [https://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-N...](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFeeling-Good-New-Mood-Therapy%2Fdp%2F0380810336&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=PohWI97qP0Y&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbHh5SnVyWmpYbzBJSWxKS3Jid1pzcGN6Q2NNZ3xBQ3Jtc0ttWDRpUzlHcVVzbV90OFZYOUVJMnNFcjRxYTA4TkZrYVBJb2dHblFzcUQyVHNLODZMQUl0VG91TE1meGZDdGRzSGF5dXJHVWozMU1WM3dyUkNua0RlSWliQUU0b1BIRmpjb0hNLUxpVVgzb1VpdXJNaw%3D%3D)  Scientifically backed ways to out train the negative thinking, depression and anxiety. This book served me wonders in addition to therapy. What science shows is if you dedicate \~3 months to processing the pain and healing, a lot of the depression and anxiety can go away. The main point being you do it now rather than later so when tough events happen later in life, we know how to properly deal.   

The Holistic Psychologist: [https://www.youtube.com/c/TheHolistic...](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheHolisticPsychologist/featured)   she explains how events shape us, attachment theory, letting go of the past, etc in a productive and helpful manner  

 Andrew Solomon Ted Talk: [https://youtu.be/-eBUcBfkVCo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eBUcBfkVCo) \- goes over his own battle with depression and the correlation between adverse experiences and mental health   

And lastly: If you are currently struggling, just remember, you keeping yourself alive is winning because that is by far the hardest thing to do when you are in a dark place. Even if you struggle to get out of bed, shower, or eat, you are still alive and that is all that matters. Please put your wellbeing first and learn how to make yourself a priority. During the rough times, someone very dear to me would remind me that “this too shall pass” and I pass that message along to you. Feel free to share this or the resources with your family and loved ones!
