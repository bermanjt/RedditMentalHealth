I will get a spark of excitement and decide to do these things but the minute I begin actually doing it I lose any desire to do it.

2,"Why do i feel what I do is never good enough? My parents have always been caring and loving. For instance in my studies I get good grades, they say they are proud of me and to always push myself to be even better. Sometimes I feel a little discouraged by this, from their point of view they say they don't mean that what I do is not good enough, they just think I can accomplish even greater things. I kinda get it but I still feel a bit empty inside of me. My father particularly, is a very good person, but he had a bit of a troubled infancy so It's hard for him to sometimes express his feelings openly, this sometimes increases the feelings to keep pushing myself, but still, specially now that he is older he tries to do his best to encourage me.

Even when they say they are proud I feel they say it because it's the ""good parents"" encouragement you are expected give to your son. I feel kinda grateful but cursed that they always educated me to always do my best, but sometimes I wish I didn't. When i was in school, some of my friends just didn't study much or did much homework and they seemed to have more fun. I went to parties for time to time but even then their lives seemed much more relaxed. Even if I tried to live like that I couldn't, I could not just say f*ck it and don't do anything. There was always this internal guilt, even if my parents were not expecting anything in particular from me.

Idk if this translates to other parts of my life but I am not often very proud of the things I do, even do others give me praise for them. Idk why I tend to have a very cynical view of others as well, when someone compliments me is either because it is expected of them or they want something from me (I kinda feel like a child who is getting complimented by their shitty macaroni art). I know I should give myself more credit and I do try to by watching some guides and videos about self worth but it just doesn't feel natural and it's very fustrating, kinda like if someone was expecting you to find ultimate happiness in life by reading a book ""how to find ultimate happiness in life"" and then be done with it. Even now I am bit skeptical about posting in this subreddit xD. Idk it just feels it is always the same ""motivational talk"" but doesn't solve anything, I don't really even know what I am looking for or expecting. Anyways any advice would be entertaining at least to read :)",07Sep2020,1
3,"I am 20, and really want to start therapy/counselling. I tried my University help center and felt a little dismissed; I understand though since I am not depressed,dont have anxiety or just anything debilitating right now; They service basically a campus of kids (25000+ kids) so I am not a big priority . I just want to have a someone help clean up the attic (my mental health) and just listen? Maybe help me feel less overwhelmed sometimes and help me cope with things better and just work through past experiences to help understand myself better.

My mom has EAP since she works for my university. I've read posts which state that EAP is good for short term problems but I kind of want to keep seeing someone for a while. My insurance (sun life, also from my mom) covers 350$ a year TOTAL. I see that private practices usually cost 150$ a session. That leaves me 2-3 sessions a year. 

Can someone maybe point out resources I can google? I feel guilty taking up mental health help meant for serious, immediate issues when I just want help ""preening"" my mind every month or so.

6,"Hi, I’m sorry if the title seems over dramatic or this post seems wild. 
 
I’ve been feeling really strange all day, like tired and unmotivated and just not myself. I tried to take a nap earlier but I was having racing thoughts so I couldn’t and then I heard voices (?) it was just like incoherent whispering in my ear, just once. I’ve never experienced this before but I have had periods of really bad depression where I see like flickering lights or shadows. 

I continued feeling strange all day and about an hour ago I was putting up some Halloween decorations and I started feeling very panicked, like I was being timed as if it was a race. Then things started feeling not “real” (I’m sorry i can’t articulate this better, it’s kind of like watching a movie of yourself instead of being present in your own consciousness). 

This feeling has been worsening but also now I’m like...terrified. Like I’m just in full freak out, crying terror and every noise I hear (which I think are real noises, like animals outside or my hamster in his cage) is majorly scaring me. Also, I want to hold my hamster but I’m afraid that I will crush him if I hold him, like that I’ll hurt him, even though I don’t want to. Also, when I look down, like at my phone right now, I’m too scared to look back up because I feel like there will be something there. 

For medical history, I have CPTSD (depression and anxiety included under that umbrella) and I started taking Wellbutrin XR 300mg 2 days ago as well as Norethindrone birth control. I also took one Ativan on Thursday because i had a medical procedure done, i don’t know if that’s relevant. I’ve been on Wellbutrin before but had been in a depressive episode and hadn’t taken it for 2 or 3 months. 

I’m sorry this is very disorganized and I hope it makes sense, I’m really afraid that it’s not articulated understandably or that I’m not typing real words or something. 

Does anyone have advice on like calming myself down? Is this just a panic attack? Will it pass? Like it kind of sounds like psychosis but i also think i have reasonable mental clarity. At least enough to be like “this is not normal”. I don’t think I’m at risk of hurting myself, or even my hamster. 

I’m by myself and I don’t have anyone to call. I’m afraid to go to the hospital because I’m scared they will hurt me.",07Sep2020,1
7,"Hi everyone,

I was just having a moment of self-reflection and realized that I’ve always had a hard time going to therapy because I knew my therapist didn’t care and I felt bad for making them sit and listen to me. Every time I have built good rapport with a therapist I get irritated by it and ghost them or fizzle our without a proper good bye. Whenever a therapist has gone over during a session, I’ve felt anxious and mad that I couldn’t figure out their actual motive. I would cancel sessions and miss appointments because I just don’t receive. 

I am currently a mental health care worker and mentally pretty sound and not currently in therapy (not that I can afford it anyway). I care about my clients and genuinely want to do whatever I can to see them excel. 

I am the person my friends know they can count on when they want to talk about something without being judged. I work with the homeless population because I genuinely care so deeply about their lives and want to make them feel even a tiny bit better. I know I care about other people, but in my head, I also know other people don’t care about me.

Anytime I receive a compliment my chest tightens up and I deflect and don’t believe them. Sometimes when I think about no one caring about me I get sad, but mostly I just get pissed that people think they can fool me into me thinking they care about me. 

I don’t know if I have an undiagnosed personality disorder or something, but I hate being on the receiving end so much that I don’t even have any motivation to try to change it. But it also makes me really sad and distressed so I don’t know what I want. Has anyone on here experienced this? I’ve been this way my whole life and I’m in my early 20s.",07Sep2020,1

9,"Long story short, I’m a male in my late 20s. I’ve had a tough life growing up. My father was deported to Lebanon when I was a kid and I ended up growing up there. I survived two explosions, terrorist attacks, and I grew up in a poor household.  
In my teens, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and it was difficult for me to make friends. When I went to college, I had a nervous breakdown one day and was kicked out.  
I moved to LA in 2014 and crashed at a relative’s place. We had problems and they kicked me out and I ended up homeless.  
Fast forward 5 years later, things turned around when I got on medication, learned programming, became an engineer, got in shape, etc.  
However, I’ve come to a point in my life where I have no friends or family due to my neurotic and dysfunctional behavior. Every time I meet someone, I’ll eventually fight with them at some point and either end up blocking them or ending up being blocked.  

My resentment and anger towards society and how I’ve been treated growing up and in my early twenties is something I haven’t been able to let go.  
I’ve contemplated going to therapy, but I feel there is nothing a therapist can do to help out. I’ve gone to a therapist before and all they did was listen to me for months with nothing else. I would have been better off buying Alexa and talking to her.  

Also, I’ve taken an oath to take some secrets to the grave. There are things that happened to me in my life that I’d rather die than tell anyone. It’s something off the table and non-negotiable.  I’ve been told unless you open up to therapist, it’s pointless.  

What are my options here? Should I find a therapist anyway? Should I reach out to family? I feel like I’m grasping on straws and that no one will be able to related to what I’ve been through in my life.",07Sep2020,1

14,"Hey, I am a 20 year old female and I have anxiety, depression, and have the rare dissociative moments. I'm currently in the process of being diagnosed. Posting on a phone.

So last night I felt myself start to slowly panic. But this panic isn't like a racing heart and crying and freaking out that's in a physical sense. Its scary. I basically get panicked and my body starts to shut down, my arms get heavy (I feel like I can't move them) and my heartbeat is all I can feel and hear. Mentally I can't concentrate and I have tunnel vision, time is just not a concept anymore. My arms feel shaky but won't shake but if I stand my legs give out. I try to frantically find music to help me in this situation (or I try to trigger a panic attack but it rarely works) and when I do find music I just sort of spiral and I'm just sitting there unable to do anything or move or help myself as I just am panicking internally hearing my heartbeat. I try to focus on other things but it's impossible to ignore your own heartbeat in your chest. 

It's like being trapped in a body you can't control. You're freaking out and you're just sitting there like your brain and body disconnected. From an outsiders view I'd just be sitting watching YouTube while internally I'm just freaking out. I was stuck like this for 4 hours until I remembered some sleeping pills I had designed to relax you which I took. When I'm in this state sugar helps me bounce back again so I can move and think but it only helps for a couple minutes until I'm back in the same position even if I use the time to get up and try to feel better.

In the past it's gotten so bad I would describe it like my body died but I was still inside. It's just this horrible feeling and you just can't stop focusing on your heart or that feeling in your limbs or anything. And I have no idea what it is, no way to really say ""I'm having *insert name for thing happening* so I can get help. It's horrible to be like this and I haven't had this happen for what feels like a year now so I'm scared this will become more common again like it was a year and a half ago. 

I've tried looking it up but I can't find anything that fits how I feel. So my question is, what is happening to me? How can I prevent this? It doesn't seem like a typical panic attack or anything and it just comes out of nowhere. I'm scared to have it happen again or that it will happen while I'm at work.

Also if I did anything wrong like violate rules or templateing or something then I'm sorry in advance. I just want help",07Sep2020,1
15,"Hi, I’m in a bit of distress right now. My sister has been dating someone for 6 months who is bipolar. He hasn’t been on medication for some time (we don’t know how long) and has experienced some episodes while with her and when talking to us. His job situation while dating has been very rocky and financially he is not doing well. He’s pretty much almost homeless. My sister has gotten herself into credit card debt trying to support him and he recently had an episode when my family said they will not house him unless he is on medication, seeking counsel, etc. 

I’m not sure how to handle all of this. Should I be contacting an institution? I know those kinds of things have all kinds of negative connotations. Apparently an ex-girlfriend of his called him into an institution before and he did not like the experience. He says that his family isn’t willing to take him in. Unfortunately, he’s also put himself at an impasse with my family who was willing to help support him initially, but with everything going on now it’s too much for them to handle.

It makes me really sad because of everything going on. But he’s almost at the point of bringing his things into our house and refusing to leave, which I know is not right at all.

Im having episodes of schizophrenia from all of the stress and they are getting more frequent, my episodes can be complex.

19,"Hello,

I have a quick question about something that's been bugging me for awhile now. Most nights when I am in bed trying to sleep, I'll hear random noises or word / sentence fragments in my mind, about 80% of the time they will be spoken by someone I know. I never know what they're saying, usually its just a noise or a part of a word, but it's definitely not me that is thinking it. I've also had a couple experiences where there will be a scenario in my mind about something violent, and then immediately after I'll feel an extremey abrupt and scary sensation in my brain and see some kind of circle in my vision. But the circle isn't actually there, in the room, only in my mind's eye.

These have been happening for a months and their frequency increases and decreases with time. It's more frusturating and unnerving than anything else, but lots of the time I will also see things (small, like movement) in my field of vision whenever I have these thoughts.

Before anyone assumes anything, I'm not in some ""state between dreaming and wakeness"". I'm always 100% awake when these things happen, just in bed and laying down.

Anyone have similar experiences? And if anyone knows what these are / mean, could you let me know?",07Sep2020,1

For the last four years, my days continously have gotten worse and worse. Not them being bad days, just my good days are when I have a reason to get out of bed.
Of course there are exceptions every couple of months.

Those last four years, I've been very tired, and just bored of pretty much everything. I'm almost 100% sure that I have depression. Me and my aunt had a very short conversation that she dismissed right afterward. 

I dont know what feeling happy is like, you may hear this from people far worse off than I am. But I have times where I just get excited, like my heart rate increases but I don't ever feel good.

Self harm. No, but I've tried it, but I was too scared to push the knife hard enough into my skin, not worried about my health but about me getting yelled at by my parents.

Suicidal thoughts? Pretty regular, every 1-2 days. But I care too much about the select few people that I do care about, to actually go through with it

Home Life? I have probably the ideal home life, and hearing about others difficulties, makes me both angry and sad at the same time.

for as long as I can remember I have a hatred towards people just in general. Especially the ""nice"" people,  I don't believe true sympathy exists. If somebody is nice they have a reason for it. I can not convince myself otherwise. That's probably the main reason I havent told my parents yet,

I mean if my gf has plans, I’ll usually work for 8 hours at my desk, workout for an hour and eat (so maybe 2 hours time), and then play video games with friends until 1 or 2 then repeat the cycle. Most of my really close friends are out of state for new jobs, and my other group of friends are all gamers so we rlly just hangout online (other than weekends we go out).

I also have the mindset of not wanting to hangout with people generally speaking. I prefer to be alone as I don’t trust a whole lot of people and It’s just generally hard to find “good people”. I’m also kinda quiet when I am with people bcuz I don’t do a lot so I don’t have much to have conversation about. 

Not sure if I just need to pick up more hobbies and stay more active so that I maybe would want to hangout w people more? idk I moist sick of hating myself no natter what i do. If I stay home I have fun playing games w my friends but I also kinda hate myself for just sitting at my desk all day.",07Sep2020,1
39,"So, this is the first time I openly (behind a nickname) speak about this. When I was studying my undergraduate degree I wasn't the best or the worst student, just average and while going there I fell in love with someone. We made a lot of plans for the future but I had to retake a few courses and at a point we declared ourselves madly in love with each other, we had a lot of chemistry together, but he always resented me for losing time and having to retake those courses. Anyway,  to make a long story short, our plan was always to go live/study/work abroad. He got a scholarship and left, I went to visit and we made plans of me finishing everything back home, graduating and leaving the country and reuniting for us to be together and live our best life. A week after visiting and making some more concrete plans, he broke up with me, just because he couldn't handle a LDR. That was devastating for me because not only I had lost my love but I had lost my plans and I had no ""Plan B"". I let 2 or 3 years go by, and I focused on building a career home and I did at some extent create a succesful career, pioneering in certain new areas, but now I have the drive again to start looking for opportunities abroad, I tried to get a scholarship into a prestigious university abroad, for which I obviously didn't succeed with my average grades. So now, I'm scared about applying for any degree anywhere because I feel like I'm not good enough for anything related to studies and that's in a good part due to having some scars from that relationship that still burn from time to time. Guess what was the first time he did when breaking up? Marry a PhD, or Post-Doc or whatever. 

I'm just so tired of self sabotaging and feeling anxious about being not good enough for anything and not being able to go abroad to study or work which was my dream too.  I have lost so much life thinking about that and I don't know what to do to stop feeling like that.",07Sep2020,1
40,"I'm a new college freshman and a few weeks ago I developed some very mild covid like symptoms and got quarantined by my university. I was just moved back into my dorm on Friday and its now the 2nd full day of my freedom.

 But I don't feel free. I've stayed in my dorm the last few days hesitant to leave. Today I went to the dining hall to get brunch and dinner and those excursions alone had me anxious. I can't pinpoint why I'm anxious exactly. It could be because its a long weekend and there's not many people here but when I leave my room I feel like I'm being stared at and judged and so I get really spacey, like my body keeps doing things and I'm pulled back just thinking and watching it go. Its a little scary and I dont think its a safe thing to have happening on a college campus whenever I leave my room. 

This only started when I came back and I assume once classes start on Tuesday I'll be ok but I definitely understand people with agoraphobia more now. I dont think I have it but even experiencing a baby version of it is awful. To anyone suffering out there Im sorry and I believe in you.

48,"TLDR: I've recently discovered 55% of people have never and will never experience a mental health disorder and quite frankly, I'm pissed.  


I have mental heath issues. I grew up in a family with mental health issues. My best childhood friend had mental health issues. Most of my friends throughout high school had struggled with some form of mental health issue. My boyfriend also has mental health issues.   


I was unknowingly under the impression that while not everyone struggles with persistent mental health problems like I, or some of my friends/family do, the large majority of people have experienced some form of depression, anxiety or even a cheeky nervous breakdown from time to time.   


Until, I came across a mental health awareness campaign that said something along the lines of ""Mental health is a huge issue! Around 45% of people will experience some form of mental health problem at least *once*  in their lives!"". So I'm like, ""What do you mean only 45%???"".

  
This stat really stuck in my head, so I tried to find evidence of this magical 55% of people who didn't wake up every morning just trying to cope.  Last night I was chatting with some people from work (all uni students as well) and I asked them how many of them had had a breakdown due to their degrees at some point. *Fully* expecting them to all say ""Ahahaha YUP"" in agreement. Instead, they looked at me like I was crazy and just said ""Well, I mean, I've gotten stressed before but I've never like cried or anything."".  


That's when it hit me that the %55 was all around me. They had been the whole time. I realized that I've been comparing myself to people who don't spend most days dealing with some really dark shit. I realized that I, and many of the amazing people I know, have an utterly debilitating, silent, invisible, misunderstood disability that no one can possibly empathize with unless they've been through it. I've always been so hard on myself. Trying to push myself to be able to function the same, and better as those around me. I've been fighting life with both hands tied behind my back and blindfolded while thinking everyone else had the same handicaps.   


This news isn't comforting to me. Because I also have to live with the knowledge that most people will never see what I'm fighting and will continue to blame me if I'm not always strong enough.",07Sep2020,1

55,"So it turns out therapy is pretty damn expensive (and since I opted for a HDPD, it’s not covered by my insurance). I’ve called around a handful of places and the highest I heard of was $395/session and the lowest $150. Jesus!

Even with the sliding scale, I make too much for a discount with this place I’m having a consultation with (I picked the $150 place). At least that’s what the person on the phone said when I was asking about cost. 

Realistically there’s no way I can afford $150 every week. Even though I make enough on paper, I still have other things to pay for, to save for, and to pay off (debt). I’m comfortable with $150/month at MOST. 

I’ve come to the conclusion that I either 1) need to keep searching for a therapist that may have more generous sliding scale policy; 2) costs less; 3) once a month appointments.

56,"This is long, TLDR; I have no distinct skills, talents, or passions, don't know where to acquire some, and failure highlights how I don't have skills, talents or passions.

Look, I know that there are \*things\* I have to be proud of. I've made achievements and I've surpassed myself before in my young life. I know that I'm not \*supposed\* to compare myself to others, and that I should remain focused on \*myself\*. But with each time I focus on myself, I'm reminded that I've wasted all of my youth as I head into my thirties. I don't have any talents or skills, I'm not particularly useful or adept at things, and it bothers me to think that I'm heading into my full adulthood as someone who's not particularly useful and will require a lot of help in ways that I cannot return to anyone.

For my entire life I've been a sedentary and lonely guy, except for my late teens but that's not really here nor there. I've had some pretty serious social anxiety that I had to deal with, which prevented me from socializing and participating in sports well into my teens. I had a father who wasn't very patient. His tempter was made worse by his fucked up back that made working with him difficult. I never really connected with him because he would shout when he was angry, and his impatience made me shy away from doing work with him. I played a lot of video games as a kid, which I don't really do so much anymore, and as a result I don't really have these skills I would have learned doing normal kid stuff.

I am not musically talented; I enjoy lots of music and used to play a few instruments as a kid but that never followed through. I am not physically talented; I don't have any cool tricks I can do or sports I can play, as an individual or on a team. I don't know a whole lot about how to fix stuff, build stuff, create stuff, work with stuff, or otherwise provide any sort of goods or services for myself or others. I can cook myself some food, but that feels like a fairly default thing to do to be an independent adult. When I notice all the things that others seem to do, have knowledge of and take enjoyment from, I really can't help but be a little disappointed in myself.

A friend group of mine has begun planning and discussing the creation of a co-operative living space. I took a peek at the survey, and one question stuck out to me: What skills do you possess? What can you do that makes you a good housemate? And I thought, fuck man, not a whole lot. I can try to be a good roomie and be courteous, but there's really nothing I can do to help the processes of a household in a way I could jive with on a daily basis. A dude I was talking to for a long time through some shared kink interests is way beyond my skill level, having already pursued my post-secondary path and went on to an MBA, plays a number of sports, plays several instruments, is into machining and vehicle mechanics, and all around dwarfs me in terms of being a well-rounded adult. This all seems antithetical to living a healthy life, but frankly, \*\*I don't understand how these comparisons aren't real or how I shouldn't be stacking my behind-the-scenes against someone's highlight reel, because my highlight reel also pales in comparison to so many others.\*\*

I want to feel good at things and adept as a grown adult who can handle stuff on his own, pursue hobbies and interests, and contribute. Outside of my career path, I don't really think I contribute a whole lot. And as a student, soon to be busy young professional, I don't honestly know where I'll find the time to develop skills and passions. Everything feels cost prohibitive, and where I live I cannot seem to find some sort of fellowship or workspace that will help me practice things. I also have a terrible fear of failure, because it feels like an underline of the fact that I'm not all that good at anything. I don't know how to handle it well, and I think it holds me back from things.

I might also be neurodivergent; it's tough for me to organize myself into pursuing something new that I haven't really done before and don't really know if I'm making progress on, and feel like I lack a certain degree of executive function (this working from home thing has been incredibly difficult for remaining on task). I need something to schedule a slot of time for me, like a class, and someone to help me figure out what I'm doing, like a teacher, if I want to make progress. However, it feels like this only really exists for private lessons in creative or musical endeavours, and there isn't someone who can help me gain helpful skills relevant to fixing or building things.  

To wrap things up, I feel like shit. I feel like I wasted my youth not understanding I had my whole life ahead of me, and now that I've begun to work on my mental health issues, I don't know where I can surpass my all to real feeling of uselessness. I know a number of things are as easy as taking lessons, but I can barely afford them, and many things aren't so easy. Each failure makes me feel worse about who I am as an adult, and I don't even know where to start that will make me feel OK with myself. I just want to feel like I have an identity that I can be proud of. I want to feel confident in myself and don't know where to start.",07Sep2020,1

**Sometimes the most significant obstacle keeping you from achieving your goals is yourself. This is not just your problem. It’s a global problem. In the United States alone, 84% of people are affected by procrastination; 1 in 5 procrastinate every day.** 

**Before we start talking about procrastination, we need to understand what procrastination is and where it comes from.**

WHAT IS BASICALLY PROCRASTINATION?

**It simply means waiting until the last minute to complete a task. Researchers estimate that procrastination can come for many reasons.**

1. **If we grew up in a very authoritative parenting style, like ‘they always try to control you, you have today now’ so we procrastinate as a form of rebellion**.
2. **Fear of failure plays a vital role in your procrastination. You don’t want to fail in your life, and deep down, you believe that you can’t achieve success in this field. For example, You know that you need to work hard to get a job in a company like Google. But you also know there are so many competitions and you are an average student, so it’s not possible for you to go there. So It’s a dream to work for Google. But it’s hard for you.**
3. **Lack of motivation. I saw so many people in my life; they don’t have any goals in their life. That’s why they just put things off, cause they don’t even know if the particular item is important from them or not.** 

In most cases, procrastination is not a sign of a serious problem. It’s a common tendency that most people give in to at some point or another.

TYPES OF PROCRASTINATORS.

1. **Arousal type procrastinators: That is someone who loves that euphoric high and adrenaline rush, they want to become the best in the class, but mostly they do everything at the minute.** 
2. **The people who don’t want to take responsibility: You may have heard that some people say, I don’t know how I should do this if it goes wrong, I don’t know anything, I will not take any responsibilities.** 
3. **The people who don’t want to fail:  They always think, if I dont put any effort in, so there is no chance of failure. But they firmly believe that, if they do the work, then I will give my 100% effort. But unfortunately, they don’t want to do anything.**

OVERCOME PROCRASTINATION. 1. BREAK YOUR GOALS:

One of the most important reasons we procrastinate is that, subconsciously, we find our task overwhelming. To make it less intimidating, break it down into smaller goals, and now focus on one goal at a time. Not only is the resulting amount of work more manageable, but it also doesn’t look as overwhelming. 

When you complete the smaller goal of the task, you will feel a sense of accomplishment. This helps reinforce your determination to tackle the rest.

59,I am regularly in touch with my parents and I have to take financial support from them during this pandemic which makes this situation more complicated for me. They provide unsolicited advice all the time and I don’t feel emotionally connected with them. I have never felt connected with them.,07Sep2020,1
60,"I'm a guy in my early 30s. For some reason people tend to really overshare their personal stuff, when they are with me. Needless to say it's not the cute, funny and bright side of their past but rather sickness, mental issues, family issues, relationship issues, death, job issues etc.

I had a bad experience (not of intimate nature) 20 years ago regarding a what I though back then my best friend. We were together since the beginning of kindergarden all the way to my 12th year. When I was 11 this person blackmailed me and that opened up my eyes, revealing to me his (later on as I discovered) narcissistic nature. I cut off my ties with him completely but I also closed myself to the world around me. That was 20 years ago...The first 4-5 years I hated him, then the next 4-5 years I hated myself for hating someone that much. Then I decided to change. Sadly it was not the best way to do it so I just started investing my time in helping others as much as I can.

Fast forward last year, when I got so stressed from work that I quit and left on an almost 8 month bicycle trip with a tent across Europe. All that time (most of it alone) I had a lot of time to self-reflect and decided to make MAJOR changes to my life. I postponed things for half a year this year to wrap up some stuff with some people and now I've started to work on my issues.

You may wonder why I'm telling you this? Well, from my experience with other people, who have been in some sort of a toxic relationship holding things inside you is very damaging in the long run (me being a fine example). In may case I have severe trust issues, which have also manifested into intimacy issues. I have never kissed a girl, never went on a first date and needless to say never had a real intimate relationship.

I'm not a bad looking guy (according to my friends) but I fall into the category of a nice guy. I try to help those around me however possible. Sadly sometimes it leaves me completely emotionally drained.

I met this woman (she is 5 years younger than me) about a month and a half ago. She has been through a lot in her life - alcoholic father (who died from cancer and exhibited child neglect to both her and her two brothers), a brother who was recently diagnosed with psychosis, a series of very bad relationships (including her first one age between 14-15), drinking issues etc. She attended therapy a year ago and discovered a lot about herself and started changing her life including what she works. Now she is trying to become yoga instructor and nutrition adviser for both adults and children, changed her diet starting 10 years ago and now lives a very healthy life.

On our first date she shared a lot about her past with me. Something that I somewhat felt uncomfortable with but decided to also open up on our second date. So now we will be going out on our 5th date and we are taking things slow even though I might be rushing sometimes due to my lack of experience that I haven't told her about. Planning to though...

My point is however the following: I don't want to become her emotion dumpster. The new me made that loud and clear when I told her I don't want to be her therapist and she said she is not expecting that from me. I am currently working on creating barriers to protect myself from what other people share with but I fear I might overdo it. I am very emotional but learned to hide it at a very young age. That thing about my childhood friend is something I kept even from my parents, who love me very much and are very carrying. That is actually the main reason why I didn't tell them the full story - I didn't want to hurt them. I did tell them he blackmailed me and that I no longer want to see him but I didn't tell them about the aftermath and how I just everyone out completely. I made a mistake clearly and only 2 months ago I shared that with them, leaving them devastated and very sad. My mother even told me she was scared of me doing something to myself. Needless to say I am not going to (life is the most precious gift one can ever receive) but I did quit my job (again; it was a really toxic environment for me there) and spent like a month going through my past and issues, crying several times a day.

Now I am better and realise that I am still (yes, in my 30s) very emotionally immature. I thought that emotional intelligence is you being able to control and hide your emotions but it's actually the complete opposite. I am able to completely shut down and play along, exhibiting completely opposite emotions to what I truly feel on the inside. Mostly this would mean me witnessing something that angers or upsets me but pretending to be okay with it and not really carrying that much, while inside it's crushing my heart. One thing I've decided is to no longer to that.

Examples:

A neighbour of mine is getting evicted. She has a drinking problem, is late with her rent all the time and has damaged to properly. The house owners (who also live in the same building) have been on her case for a long time and finally managed to kick her out. Since I've recently moved here I was unaware of all this. However when they both sides started telling me that stuff I just said: ""Sorry, this is not really something I want to involve myself into"". My previous self from 2-3 months ago would have just sat there and listened, and listened, soaking it all in without uttering a word.

That neighbour needs help moving her stuff out and I offered a hand (also in order to prevent too much chaos in the building because she is anything but organised). Her family is grateful for me helping out but also try to dump their emotional garbage on me. Her mother came to me yesterday to ask for my phone number and if I will be available next Sunday. I told her that she can have my email address and that next weekend I will probably be busy. She started whining about the situation and all that. I stood there and told her: ""Look, I've offered my help for moving stuff out but nothing more. Your issues are family issues and no my issues. When you need me to move the stuff out, contact me in advance a couple of days before that. Decide what you want to throw out and what to keep. I will not waste my time standing there, while you are discussing that.""

To be honest it hurt me a little bit for being that straight forward about my feelings and thoughts on the matter but now (a day later) I actually feel pretty good about what I did. I will help them out but the moment they start whining and shouting at each other I will pack my sh@t and leave them deal with all that.

My only fear is to not push people away this way. I'm very new to this behaviour where I actually put some boundaries and I might come too hard on some people. Then again being direct and expressing how you feel about a certain situation/action should not have that effect on others, if they are really worth building a relationship with, right? I even dropped like 15-16 people out of my life so that I can start fresh and not deal with all the drama they had around them. I do like communicating with people but I also don't want to return to my old ways of being an emotional punch bag for someone, who I might have even met for the first time. This includes an intimate relationship with that woman. Due to her past she has a lot of trust issue and she told me about that just like I told her about my trust issues. We decided to take things slow but at the same time I fear I might rush something too much. I wanted for us to go out hiking and what not on our 2nd or 3rd date. She told me she likes the fact that I am thinking about future activities together but that sometimes less is more. My immaturity and lack of experience in this matter are things I feel very insecure about but I will give it a shot. After all it's a learning experience. I am thinking about telling her I have never dated anyone before and will see how she reacts to that. She is younger but has far greater experience than me. I think that if she accepts that, she will be someone I can become really close to (on an intimate level). Needless to say I am scared what would happen if she calls things off. We have only been on 4 dates so far so I don't know what to expect. Then again if she feels uncomfortable about my lack of experience she is not the right one...

This post is quite chaotic but I just got up this morning and decided to share this with you. Since I am still figuring things out I want to tread lightly with how much and fast I reveal about myself to the people around me. Dumping 15-16 people in an instant was pretty tough but a decision I don't regret. Still the people that are left in my life are people, who I truly care about. So I want to share these things with them too but when the time is right. Before that I need to still figure a lot of things about myself. I was even thinking about going to a therapist but then decided to dissect myself and try to do it on my own since I have had a lot of experience analysing and helping others. Never turned these skills towards myself though...Pretty tough...At least I am through with crying all the time and now I feel much better and will even start looking for a job. I do have the money to support myself for 2-3 years without lifting a finger (I'm a software developer) but I would love to teach and do research. One of the reasons I quit my previous job was that I knew I had to spend time on my own dealing with my stuff and combining that with a job would make things impossible.

I just want to learn to be myself and not pretend I am someone else. I want for people to connect with me but create actual connections and not just use me to dump their personal issues.",07Sep2020,1

63,"As far as I know, I've been diagnosed with ADHD and some kind of depression/anxiety. My psych doesn't want to put me on Wellbutrin since that can spike my anxiety (I was also on it for a bit long before I started seeking help- prescribed by a family doctor, but I forgot exactly why). We tried Escitalopram and Lexapro. I feel like I was much less anxious with Lexapro, but it also made it hard for me to process anything- almost mentally catatonic. She stopped them and then started me on mood stabilizers, and the first one, Lamotrigine just didn't do anything for me, and my anxiety spiked through the roof. 

I'm on my third dose of Olanzapine and the past two days have been just trash. I usually sleep in on weekends, but I felt dead waking up at 5 *in the evening* after taking my first dose at 9 the night before, then going to bed maybe close to 11. A similar thing happened last night where again I took a dose at 9 in the evening, went to bed sometime after 11, and then woke up towards 4 in the afternoon. On top of the bad sleep schedule, I feel almost drunk. I wouldn't mind if it was just for the first few minutes after waking up, but it seems like it won't go away. I'm somewhat dizzy, and at times I can't even read correctly, much less focus on something. Some sensitive places, like my lips or fingertips, feel almost numb. I feel generally weak and my head just isn't right, and this is supposed to be a low dose.

I have a bit of a history with sleeping too much and being hard to wake up, so maybe that's just what it is, but I can't really tell what I should be doing at this point. I mean, I guess I should go ahead and call up my psych and let her know this med might just be bad for me, but maybe I have to ride out the initial effects. I'm kinda worried because I'm supposed to be going to school and I'm scared to even try when I'm feeling like this. I have a 30 minute drive to the school, and I have to leave an hour early to make it to class. If I can't wake up, I guess I just miss class. If I feel dizzy, I might not be good to drive. Even if I make it to class, what if I just can't process what's being taught?

So, should I just take the hit and try to get through at least this week with the medicine? I guess it's kinda common sense telling me to tell my psych, but she can be hard to get a hold of with how busy her days are, and if the side effects go away, maybe this could be the medicine.",07Sep2020,1

My dad apparently had some symptoms way back like 40 years ago, but he says he overcame them and hasn’t really had any since.

I am living with the people who took us in 7 years ago when she went to the hospital and lost her leg due to doctors fucking her over and giving her medicine she was allergic to that was in her records. She got 40-50 blood clots from it in her right leg. Then she slowly got addicted to opioids. I didnt notice.. I just knew she was ""in pain"" it was the doctors fault. She was taking over 200% of the regulated amount for Oxycontin and Oxycodone. Cause of death was OD. She was fucked over her whole life and it pisses me off. She deserved so much better. I saw her change.. From her happy normal self, to how she was on drugs.. She was still loving though. Always caring.. Anyway.. After her passing.  I began working. Got her car repaired that she accidentally wrecked when on the pain meds. It took $2015 to fix it. She wanted to see it fixed so bad.. She missed the car. That was her only freedom and I took care of her. Did what she needed. She said I was her rock, her help. That she wouldnt know what to do without me.  Well. I got it insured and licensed, $350. I just turned 20 and I just got a better job. From working for less than $10/hr for way too much responsibility. I will be working at this new place for 10.50 an hour and will get a raise when fully trained.  I still feel like its hopeless.. Im always stressed and super tired.

I keep getting these thoughts I dont want of suicide or self harm. Only reason I havent done it know is probably because of my sister.. I dont want her to lose her brother she loves.. I try to spend time with her and make her happy. She is only 11. I don't want to break her heart.. The thought of someone having to tell her that her brother is dead.. It hurts.

70,"A little shout me - Im 29M, full time employed remote working a design job that I enjoy, and also have freelance on the side, my income is great. I’m pretty on top of my workouts MWF, and i’m also lucky in that I have a few (although distance) solid bro’s for me in my friend circle.

That said, I just moved into my own place - which i’m very much so enjoying, however it’s because a nearly 3 year relationship just ended. It was the most healthy and peaceful split I had, and it was a mutual thing - we both grew with each other and helped each other grow but we could both feel a pull to still want to grow independently and go back to our individual journeys. 

We split a few weeks ago and I moved into the new place last week. I’m typically someone who gets consumed in work, as I enjoy it and the older i’ve gotten the better I am at making money and figuring out how to sell my design services.

I’ve intentionally aimed to kick off this transition with less work focus and more just hanging out with myself and me time, I even renewed my classic world of warcraft subscription just to have an outlet to do nothing while also doing something.

The thing is though i’m still having a difficulty just being with myself and being mentally okay with the idea of doing nothing. It’s like I want to focus on something and simultaneously I can’t because all of this me time is so new I sort of don’t know how to deal with it. I suppose time helps all things but I sort of feel lost in my own head a little bit as of late.

72,"Soo, i think i get emotionally attached to famous person. I have that feeling since i was in junior high school. I always imagine a life with the famous person that i like at that time like every night before bed or just when i don't have anything to do, or simply when i'm washing dishes and don't know what to think about. It still happens now, i'm 21 years old btw. I thought it was just a crush. But everytime they have a lover, i kinda feel sad and i became to hate the famous person that i like also their lover. It's not like i commented on their social media or throw hate on them. It's just me don't like them anymore.
It's not only to one person, because sometimes i feel bored too when they don't have interest thing to share to the fans or i became bored on imagining them with a lot of scenarios of our future life. Sometimes it's because they do something that i don't like. But again, i don't throw hate on them. Just simply going away from them.
I don't stalk them, or giving them any presents. Maybe it's because i live far away from them, i don't know if they live near me, i will be a stalker or not. But maybe not. I know that it's a bad thing to do and it will make them uncomfortable.
One of the things that weird is i don't want to meet them in real life. I feel like i will be sad because i know that i am just a fan and i became to realize that we would not have a life like what i imagined. I don't wanna go to their concert, because i'm jealous that a lot of people love them too and they are better than me. (Okay that's crazy, lol) but i really feel that.
Soo, the reason why i decided to say this things is because a week ago, i have a crush on a thai actor. He is a rising actor, currently playing a series. He is famous in my country too. But i thought that no one in my circle would know him. So i was loving (yes, love) him for 2 or 3 days (a week ago). You know when the love just rising and you just crazily in love with them. But then, i saw my friend's ig story that showed the thai actor face and she said that this guy is handsome and she likes him. I suddenly cried then. I feel soooooo sad, and the bad thing is i started to feel like i don't wanna talk to her anymore. And of course i don't wanna see the thai man anymore. Even now, i feel soooo sad. I always think that i need to look for someone new to replace him and forget about those feelings so i will talk to my friend again. I mean i would if i need to, but i will avoid her talking about the thai man.
That's my story, i'm sorry my english is not that good. But yeah i need you to tell me if it's actually a syndrome or not. Thank you for reading ❤",07Sep2020,1

I have been quarantine since march. No parties, no traveling, etc. just seeing my parents every 1-2 weeks and going to target. I tried exercising every day for three to lose some weight. But during that time I was obsessed with losing weight and became depressed about it. I was abusing laxative’s every other day. Not eating. Binge eating. Starved myself of carbs 

I tried to purchase stuff to create a hobby, like a bike or something. But due to pandemic unemployment cant really afford much but my rent. 

I have tried to ask my boyfriend if we can go to sedona, az just to go on a hike to a waterfall where we would have little to none human contact just us. 
But he is too paranoid for that. 

I just feel stuck. Im depressed. Avoid looking at mirrors. Im moody. I get mad at every minor thing my boyfriend does or says. My mother as well. 

Im at the point to get a way from this. I want to go on a hike to sedona and hang at a creek. Maybe sleep in the car overnight and go back to the creek and chill. Then go home.

Hello! 

I’m a young health professional who has just been through his first psychotic/manic episode, during which I wrote my first fiction book! It has what I like to think is a super unique plot loosely based on my mental health saga. 

It’s an action-packed adventure/psychological thriller/sci-fi.

The best part is that it’s available for just one dollar! 

Here’s the synopsis: 

On a tiny planet in a distant galaxy, warfare has evolved to the point that the mind has become a literal battlefield. As power-hungry warriors leap through eyes and seize thrones at the back of brains they create slaves and build armies. Sixteen year old Kahu is thrust from his peaceful external life into a chaotic internal world when his tribe is destroyed by Centre-Point, leaving him as the lone survivor.

  
 Although his family are dead; they live on within his head. Armed with four defenders internally, Kahu meets a powerful beast who gives him an ultimatum, forcing him to unite the remaining tribes and lead a siege upon Centre-Point or risk extinction of his new tribe. As he meets other leaders Kahu discovers the truth, while growing more powerful with every fight.

87,"Earlier today I was spending some with my friends (normal) in my school breaks. So during my first break I went to my friends and for a bit we were just talking about stuff, and then all of a sudden they started making fun of me for always being so *close* to them, being *right up against them*, having my shoes *touch* theirs, not leaning up against the wall like them and instead standing in the open by doing things like standing in a circle against each other (during covid). Then the bell rang.

After the bell rang once more for lunch I went back and my friends decided to play a game (we play it because for some reason people still like playing it), so one of my friends said I should be in, then someone mentioned someone else not being in ""for ever"", that person then complains about it and says it should be me, I and another say we both could be since we are both pretty bad, then they decide on counting to 21. It of course lands on me being in, then one of them tells me to count for 90 seconds which I complain about because nobody else counts for 90 seconds, however it's just dismissed. Afterwards I count for a minute because that is the usual, so I start to chase after them then when I catch up, one of them complains about me not counting for a minute, the other says I was supposed to count for 90 seconds, consequently I decide to do something better with my time.

After all of that I notice they keep coming to the area around my classroom but I'm not sure if it's they want to apologize, poke more fun at more, or anything else? As a result I ran from the area until the bell rang for the penultimate time that day.

Now, before that, about a year ago, I was in a different friend group, they'd always criticize me for being bad at sports (e.g. ""You're so fucking lazy and bad, you don't listen at all and can't even fucking get a goal without help."" because tbh I'm trash at sports) and say I'm a freak at times. Saying things like I attempted suicide for attention (when I was in a year group with like 50 people, gonna be famous cool kid now am I right?) and making suicide jokes themselves and putting their hands around my neck (not full on strangling but if tighter and with more pressure could be considered it) in front of everyone (in the friend group).

The thing is I also somewhat liked those people and like the current friend group as well because we somewhat got on well, chatted a lot, talked about stuff with them, and when I'd play games with them like football (the game I mention earlier with the new friend group) they would help me even though it's cheating and giving me an unfair advantage. Yet whenever I talk about me and my stuff nobody shows interest, ignoring it in the process and does not care unless it's making them feel better about themselves.

I get worked up over things such as people criticizing (not constructive) my stuff, making a joke about me, being ignored, saying I should do other things with my times, etc. The worst part is that I don't even know if I'm telling you (the reader) the right information or my mind warped it (I have not been diagnosed with anything and NZ mental health care is really bad).

For example, I ghosted this girl because I couldn’t deal with the extra anxiety and the pressure and I decided I didn’t like her or my best friend was called hot by some girls and I started feeling jealousy and dislike for him which is super abnormal because I am not the person to be jealous and am usually happy for others.

What are 2 things you plan to do this week to practice mindfulness?

104,"Hi, I'm a 28 year old woman and I feel like I have the coping ability of a child.
I've spoken to so many people in my life who say that they dont remember the last time they cried. In general, it seems like the vast majority of people go through most of their lives feeling really terrible once in a while, and maybe just getting sad from time to time but they just get over it.

This genuinely blows my mind. On a weekly basis at least (and usually almost daily) something sends me spiraling. Crying (and I don't mean a tear or two, but actual balling), shortness of breath, etc etc. I struggle with anxiety but that doesn't feel like a panic attack, just this deep sadness that hurts in my chest and stomach and doesn't let me breathe. 
This can be caused by anything, really. Working with a person who is being a bit of a jerk, getting into an argument with my boyfriend, getting a rude comment etc.

I feel like everyone around me grew up and just ""stopped giving a fuck"" as they described it, developed thicker skin and are much more stable, but I just can't relate. I don't feel like I've had anything different about my life (I've had my fare share of pain, but nothing insane), so my first reaction is to blame myself and feel like I'm just being a child. I know it's not constructive though, so whether it is my fault or not -- I want to make it better. But how? I've gotten better about not burdening other people with it (it's still WIP, but I am actively improving so I don't feel as stuck), but how can I get better at not feeling this deep, painful sadness at anything mildly upsetting?",07Sep2020,1

107,"Depression is like any other illness: it hurts and it’s debilitating. But at least with those other illnesses Get Well Soon cards and hospital visits and just nice gestures in general, at least those help. You can’t tell a depressive shit. Alcoholism and drug addiction are diseases. And there are group meetings and sponsor programs that can help. Other people who can help. Imagine a group meeting of the clinically depressed trying to comfort each other. No way. Depression sucks the life out of not only you but everyone you come into the slightest contact with. Nobody actually wants to hang out with you when you’re depressed. And even if they do, the depressive ignores every bit of encouragement or positivity from his well of depression. They bounce against the walls and are spit right back into the face of the well-wisher. That’s why your friends can’t help, why your therapist is limited,... why I feel the urge to make friends after reading strangers’ stories on this sub but know that friendship can’t work out between us, cause we’re fucking depressed.

Depression is a particularly cruel disease because it takes away one of the most effective coping mechanisms known to man — other people. It freezes out warmth, it numbs the tender touches, hell, it even twists people’s words and action that were for you to ones that are against or despite you. So it’s a tragedy like losing your loved one is a tragedy. But for you, the depressive, there is no consolation. A tragedy of one.",07Sep2020,1

I was like, ummmmm? Okay? She just randomly was destroying the lid. I nervously laughed and said “Okay, why are you destroying that lid?”. What I wanted to say was, “Okay, great. I’m at this job because I literally need it to live past 18. I don’t want to see you doing random shit to cups.” 
She just looked at me, and said “ewww”, and then just continued on with the day like nothing happened. 
Okay, first of all, I am going out of my way to not directly be rude to people like her at my job when people make it difficult. Second, what the fuck is up with that? Alright, then. Whatever. I just legit ignored her for the rest of the day.
Also, my manager came up to me, like, right after, and rhetorically asked “are you okay?”, so I guess I’m probably gonna get fired.

For the last four years, my days continously have gotten worse and worse. Not them being bad days, just my good days are when I have a reason to get out of bed.
Of course there are exceptions every couple of months.

Those last four years, I've been very tired, and just bored of pretty much everything. I'm almost 100% sure that I have depression. Me and my aunt had a very short conversation that she dismissed right afterward. 

I dont know what feeling happy is like, you may hear this from people far worse off than I am. But I have times where I just get excited, like my heart rate increases but I don't ever feel good.

Self harm. No, but I've tried it, but I was too scared to push the knife hard enough into my skin, not worried about my health but about me getting yelled at by my parents.

Suicidal thoughts? Pretty regular, every 1-2 days. But I care too much about the select few people that I do care about, to actually go through with it

Home Life? I have probably the ideal home life, and hearing about others difficulties, makes me both angry and sad at the same time.

for as long as I can remember I have a hatred towards people just in general. Especially the ""nice"" people,  I don't believe true sympathy exists. If somebody is nice they have a reason for it. I can not convince myself otherwise. That's probably the main reason I havent told my parents yet, 


I dont want their sympathy. I dont believe it.",07Sep2020,1

151,"The long and short of what I have to say is that over the past few months in quarantine I've developed a truly strange attachment to a celebrity. When I'm alone, I sometimes imagine I'm with a fictional version of her. Not in a sexual way, but she basically acts as a stand in for what I would want out of marriage or a committed relationship and maybe this is a psychological mechanism that prevents me from feeling isolated in quarantine. But at this point I spend so much time thinking about about a person I've never met that it's just really bad. Getting an actual girlfriend a couple months ago helped take my mind off this celebrity, but when we weren't together I kept thinking about the celebrity. My girlfriend and I broke up last week and I'm spending even more time thinking about this person. This celebrity is someone whose accomplishments I admire and respect regardless of the fact that I find her attractive, but I want to move on and leave it at that level of platonic respect. Nonetheless I look at myself and think it's so bizarre that I have this secret fixation on this woman and I wonder if there is something wrong with me. 

It's hard to find a place to begin, I might as well start in my childhood where all this started. Basically, for many years from boyhood to being a teenager I was deeply in love with my best friend. She and I were inseparable as kids, but by the time we were teenagers we were both sent to a very strict private school that banned dating - so we couldn't be together, even though we took the same classes and hung out in the same social circles. That was really painful for me, and around this time I became very invested in the films of a certain actress. Not because of her, but because I related to the themes of these movies which were very well made - she just so happened to be in them. Interestingly though, this actress looked a lot like my childhood best friend and I developed a huge crush on her. Not just because of her looks, but her on and off screen personality was very similar to my best friend. Eventually, my friend and I grew apart and I fell out of love with her - probably because of the policy imposed by the school. I transferred from that school anyway, and I haven't seen her since. 

I forgot about the celebrity for a while. But when she came out with a new release a few years ago, I developed another huge crush on her which I think was healthy at first. She wasn't just attractive, she was also someone whose accomplishments as an actress, producer, and activist I genuinely respected and looked up to. In particular, the way this actress spoke honestly about bullying and how she channeled her experiences into her professional accomplishments inspired me to do the same. I related very strongly to her characters as well as her real-life personality, and watching her films as a teen helped me get through a tough time as I transitioned into adulthood. 

From then on my crush faded and I really saw her as a skilled actress more than anything, and I continued to follow her work with curious interest. That changed earlier this year, after quarantine began. For some reason my crush came back in full force. I spent most of my time completely alone as I studied for the LSAT in my rented apartment, and sometimes at night I would imagine that a fictional version of her (not her exactly) and I were together and this prevented me from feeling alone. I went through a marathon of her films while I was studying for the LSAT, which helped get me through an otherwise stressful time. Reading and watching interviews with her talking about her craft as well as some of her difficult life experiences gave me inspiration to keep on going with the LSAT even when I felt like giving up. 

For about a month, in June when I took the test, I forgot about my crush. But after I took the test the crush came back again but this time I spent a lot of time being heartbroken that she and I couldn't be together. I knew I needed to overcome this so I booked a hotel and drove to Cape Cod and isolated myself from everyone I knew. While there, I got a girlfriend for real and we started dating. It was great at first, but when we weren't together I kept thinking about the celebrity. My girlfriend and I were together for two months, but we broke up recently and now my crush is back again. I almost feel like I have a mental illness because I am clearly obsessed with someone I've never met and I'm tired of it. Especially when I imagine myself with a fictional person based on her who doesn't exist. It's just not healthy but I don't know what do to about it.",07Sep2020,1

153,"Hello r/mentalhealth,  


I'm a schizoid, and for the longest time, I didn't care that I was one. As someone who prefers being alone, and has been able to find work, I didn't see the need to seek additional therapy for it.  


However, recently, I've been evaluating the quality of my life over the years, and I've noticed the quality of my life has always been the highest when I'm living with others (and lowest when I was completely alone).   
It seems I greatly benefit from just having the presence of others, and being able to chat with them from time to time.  


For this reason, I now believe it's important that I avoid being alone as intensely as schizoids tend to be.  


I believe it's important now for my mental health to at least talk for an extended amount of time with someone everyday.  


So ... can a schizoid stop being a schizoid, or will I be one for the rest of my life? And even if I am one for the rest of my life, to what extend does socializing with others help my condition/prove useful?  


P.S. rest assured, I'll seek therapy for what therapy is better for. I don't want this post to be 100+ comments just telling me to seek therapy.",07Sep2020,2
154,"The thought of becoming someone I always knew was the true me is a scary one, I genuinely tried to change what I knew for a fact was deep down, I hate stupidity the most, I never truly cared about anyone’s feelings unless it’s for a benefit that’s coming afterwards, and even that is just for show
 
I come from a relatively “high social statued” family, but I never really cared about a specific person’s status, all I “cared” about is a person’s ability to think, even if its “limited” due to whatever circumstances you’ve been living through, but the ability to be able to freely think has got nothing to do with whatever “education” or school you’ve gone to
 
I never shredded a genuine tear towards anyone, I only cared about myself, I had close people dying, but never really felt sad
 
I had an extremely weird childhood, I’m used to be attracted into physically hurting anything, I didn’t have the concept of getting hurt back, and when that “concept” was carved into my at that time small mind, I started using my brain a little, and made sure I wouldn’t get hurt back when I hurt whatever living being there is
 
I always was able to differentiate what was right and what was wrong, but never at that time was able to tell why, I just knew that I’d get “punished” if I did anything wrong, so I had to always act up good in order to get what I wanted, and always had to avoid whatever was considered wrong in order to steer away from unnecessary trouble
 
Grew up a little and started to get curious about the human psychology, body language, eyes, voice tone, and basically everything along the lines, loved and really enjoyed acting up depending on how you’re feeling and could easily make you subconsciously uncomfortable, scared, or loved, depending on what benefit I’m getting out of you
 
Started abusing drugs since a really young age, I basically tried everything, and even most of the really uncommon drugs, and started mixing a shit ton of medicine even, went to a dozen rehab centers, was always diagnosed as merely being an addict and antisocial, my family and especially parents, are not even able to comprehend what personality disorders are, so they basically self-diagnosed me as autistic, using the simplest terms ever due to their “limited” knowledge of mental illnesses and personality disorders, and I’m far as an autistic person is, I always enjoyed being social but it always depends on what benefit that comes with it, the thrill of being wholesome is basically a feeling I literally can’t get enough of, I feel that way by exploiting whatever your body language indicates
 
currently, I don’t particularly enjoy physically hurting someone, but I have no problems with it either, and I wouldn’t really do it because then, law enforcement would be involved, basically I just to try stray away from that, I wouldn’t really call you out by swearing, I basically only enjoy dismantling someone’s mental state by showing how obviously “superior” I am by wording out what your thoughts are, I can easily get the “higher ground” no matter who you are, never really met anyone who’s actually able to escape from such manipulative schemes, I started doing it for fun even, not just for the benefit coming afterwards, I build up lies and actually, its become relatively easy to be able to keep up with the lies built, and remember whom I told this specific lie to even, I just love to see how different people would react to different “colors” and personalities I have on stock, I can easily change colors depending on who you are, but I always am one step above
 
I tried to keep myself of thinking that I’m psychopathic, because I find people assuming they are, are actually infuriating and downright cringe worthy, also straight up calling myself that, “cringes” me down to my spine, so I literally tried myself stay away from such thought
 
And one of them reasons that kept me holding myself up of such thought is that, there was this just one time that I actually fell in love, and we were together for 3 years approx, and when we broke up, I hated it, cause injustice was involved, family related issues due to the fact we both are Egyptians and live in the middle east, during that point, I always thought I hated it because we broke up and basically we both were in love, but when I deeply think about it, all I despised was the fact that it was completely unfair, breaking up cause of family related issues, yes I cheated, and sometimes got intoxicated and shit talked her, but the fact such “injustice” was involved makes me absolutely detest such ways of thinking, I already realize cheating and unnecessary shit talking is wrong, but I basically can’t feel it (even currently as I am sober), and when I even deeply think about it even more, I only loved the affection given to me by her, not her personally, I really loved the attention given to me by someone who I know for a fact absolutely adores me, I wanted to give her the world, basically so merely I can continue on feeling such “wholesomeness”
 
Nothing I hate more than stupidity, and if there was a way to handle whatever shit, I’ll do that, I’ll automatically label you as dumb if you’ve done little to no thinking towards basically anything you’ll be doing, and that literally gives me a push to act up and get whatever benefit I can from you and completely exploit you (my thoughts and acts come to me smoothly natural), ill most definitely really enjoy dismantling your very mental state, by showing how much “better” I am, as long as I’m not breaking laws and not doing stupid shit that would label me as irrational then anything ethical could go out the window
 
I always hated the fact I’d personally call myself smart, or even subconsciously thinking so, cause that just “gives off” the psychopathic traits I have if that makes sense anyways (despised the fact I’d call myself smart cuz it cringes me), also really despised whatever and whoever is “cringeworthy”, especially those acting like they’ve got mental problems and act upon that fact, I’d gladly make it real and really would enjoy seeing you get mentally hurt cause of your own actions and your own act (don’t even think about acting mentally “sick” and show me yourself cuz I’ll easily label you as looking for attention, and I’ll act up upon that fact), but at the same time, those suffering from whatever mental illnesses, i can literally always be there, and fix whatever issues your specific illness resulted in, and already there are ton of people’s feeling so much better and thanking me too much for what I’ve done (you’re too good to be true, is often said to me)
 
Took me approx 6 months to learn a third language merely because I wanted to join a community’s specific main language to understand and comprehend how culture and language “affects people psychologically”
Found myself really into that, so took me  another two years to learn other multiple languages, merely because of such fact, I don’t do shit that would bore me, I started having international calls and not just texting and writing posts online, so I can also comprehend how tones differ from languages to another, started listening to issues at first and then started “fixing” them later on, I wouldn’t go around talking about whatever if I don’t have enough knowledge towards such subject, and if I really had to, I’ll try to understand as much as possible and ask a lot of questions without sounding like a complete dick, be it a business or anything academical or whatever
 
People calling me really smart is a daily occurrence, and I love it in contrast of how I personally think about calling myself so
 
I’m not feeling particularly sad nor happy, I’m basically feeling really empty unless I’m around people
 
I’ve got pets, dogs and cats, I don’t really have any particular affection towards them, but I just love doting to whatever is smaller than me, I genuinely smile when they do cute shit and always wanting to give them the world, I sometimes have some “grade A” meat, which is basically really expensive in my country, but I’d still give them lots of it, but at the same time, I honestly don’t really think I’d be against physically hurting them, but I just don’t do it cause they’re cute (if that even makes sense), but whenever I see posts of people hurting animals or witness it with my own eyes, I’d get really annoyed, not cause of them poor animals, cause the people doing it look pretty stupid, might sound pretty hypocrite to other people, because I personally seem to have no problems with it, basically just hating the people doing it
 
I love to talk about politics and religion and basically whatever that requires a lot of thinking, and if I’m at some point became a man of “power”, I’d have no problems and whatsoever applying “drastic” measures towards anyone who’s stupid for the sake of whatever country or district I’d be in charge of
 
I don’t particularly “enjoy” watching people dying or whatever blood-gore related videos or witnessing something in real, or any of those stereotypical anti-social disorder I might have is affiliated with, but I still have no problems seeing it either, exactly the same as watching cute cat videos for example, and even applying it towards whoever is a reason for such error, be it a country or a company or anything man-workers related companies/districts
 
Went to a dozen psychiatrists, therapists and psychologists, but in my country, none would even consider the fact I’d be having one or multiple of those anti-social traits and could easily lie to their faces, if I wanted a specific prescribed medicine, they wouldn’t even realized they’ve been lied to, the most they could come up with is affiliating my drug abuse with their “final” decision and diagnose, cause in Egypt, most of those going through them, are addicts fixing their issues and ex addicts fixing previous problems resulted by them abusing drugs at some point
 
And by tying the fact I went to dozen rehab centers and my “personality”, “it’s just issues resulted by your previous drug problems” is all I get
 
And my family aren’t any better, even more simple than those psychologists here in Egypt, diagnosing me as being “inhuman” or an “asshole”, if those are medical terms and diagnoses even
 
I’m relatively physically “appealing” by most standards, and it makes it even easier talking and manipulating whoever is a next “victim”, getting basically anything I want with just talking to people

My dad experienced abuse as a kid. As a result of that he blames his emotions onto us (my mom and I). He also always invalidates my emotions. He says I shouldn’t be stressed and he is the one I should worry about. Sometimes he goes all “nice” to make you love him again or at least attempt to and then he gets all grumpy as in blaming everything on us.

This is my latest vent but it really kinda brings to light what the “cycle” is: 

I He turns everything back around on me or my mom. He blames my mom and I for his emotions. We go out to eat so much because he is a pain in the butt to be around. He stays home and sleeps. Sometimes he tries to bamboozle me by being “nice” but then he ends up being rude again. On top of that he never lets me have personal space. I don’t like people to come really really close to me and he just comes close and I tell him personal space and he says “you don’t need personal space”. He also never gives me privacy in my room. He just barges through the door and turns on my light. I say get out but nicely and he gets mad at me because I never talk to him. Here’s the thing I don’t want to talk to him.  10 years ago he was nice and I loved my dad (I was 4). Something changed when I was 5-6 and after kindergarten, he went mean. He wants my mom to help him of things around the house but then once she tries to help he says go relax. He is the cause of my shitty mental health. He makes me love anytime from 2am to 1pm because that’s when he’s at work. But when he’s home and weekend are *hell*. Today is the last day of a three day weekend and I personally was looking forward to some rest but that didn’t happen.He’s racist to his own race and others. He’s homophobic (I’m apart of the lgbtq community but really in the closet) and he makes an excuse of “oh I have gay friends it’s okay that I can say this. ” He has caused me in the past to self harm and just stay in my room all day. He also has told me that he wishes that he had a better daughter. 
I’m an only child and I feel like I’m the cause of his behaviors. He calls me names such as “string bean” and “skinny Minnie”. It bothers me and I’ve told him to stop but he doesn’t. He has made me more self conscious about my body. This quarantine I knew what I was getting into and now I’ve been feeling numb for almost 6 months. He also jokes around and says he will hit us (he doesn’t) which is really not funny. I don’t remember the last time he hugged me or told me he loved me. He somehow says that he’s proud of me but I really don’t believe it. He is also the reason why I have trouble accepting compliments. He also says that I am too negative and he wishes I was more grateful. Here’s the thing he doesn’t really do anything for me in terms of taking care of me. My mom literally does everything. The only thing he’s doing is going to work to save up for my college (I graduate High school in a few years). 


Here’s the TL;DR of his cycle: 

1. He gets mad at himself for dropping something or just for existing
2. He blames things on us which makes us in a crappy mood which we know we don’t dare talk about it in front of him
3. He forgets what he did but still is grumpy 
4. He ends up “nice” and trying to make you love him as in just being somewhat fine to be around. 
5. Cycle repeats. 

The cycle happens once a day or the nice part happens after about a week.",07Sep2020,1

I don’t know who I am anymore. I’m so confused about the fact that I’ve done this to myself and I have no idea what to do.

For years straight, I’ve had severe, debilitating depression. It destroyed my life, it destroyed my mind, it destroyed my memory. I cried every night. I self harmed constantly. But I think somehow I did something and now I’m just..I don’t know. I’ll explain what I mean.

I can’t cry anymore. I haven’t cried for months, at the beginning whenever I felt a single tear coming I’d laugh at myself in my head and taunt myself about how pathetic it is, and now I don’t cry anymore. I got told that my grandma died last month, I loved her so much. She was the most wonderful woman. But I felt nothing. No sadness, no guilt, no care. I watched the funeral (online because of covid) in silence. 

I can’t feel anything anymore. The only thing I’ve ever felt ever since I changed was anger. But it’s not even an emotional anger, it’s a ‘stop bothering me and getting in my way’ anger. I keep hurting everybody around me. I don’t know why. It’s like it’s just second nature to me now. I hate it so much. It badly affects my life. The anger, it just comes out. I can’t control it. I’ve become cold and cruel and I’m not even able to feel any sort of..remorse for it? I don’t know if that’s the right word. Basically I don’t feel guilty. I don’t understand why. I have no answers. 

I don’t know who I am or what’s wrong with me. I could do the worst things and I wouldn’t feel anything about it. I can’t feel love. I can’t feel anything towards anybody. I’m a selfish person, I put myself above everyone because I’ve been screwed over my entire life by other people.

159,"Hi,

So I (f22) am currently on the waiting list for rape counselling, funded by the NHS in the U.K. I am also currently receiving CBT, also funded by the NHS. When I signed up for both services it asked me to put down a next of kin on the form. I put my mum down but thought nothing of this. 

My friend (f23) also receives counselling. A few days ago, she overslept and missed her telephone appointment. The counsellor called her mother, who was down as her next of kin, out of concern that she didn’t answer. This was disastrous for my friend as she didn’t want her mum to know about the sessions, and she had to explain it all to her, stuff she didn’t want her mum to know.

It never even occurred to me that this is something they might do. I’m now really anxious that if they can’t contact me for whatever reason, they will call my mum. My life would be over if my mum found out that I had been raped, or was having mental health troubles.

Well, ever since I was a 13 year old, my life has been kind of a constant awkward situation. I’ve never been able to get along with other people because I’m very (actually extremely) shy. It is very difficult to be comfortable among others and I never seem to connect with anyone. I’ve been through 3 different universities now and I haven’t met anyone I can actually consider a friend, or at least an acquaintance. 

I study Film because I want to become a screenwriter and a director, and I have realized that being a social and nice person gives a lot of opportunities. My shyness is truly destroying my life. I feel alone all the time. Everytime I try to meet somebody and make some friends, my low self-steem and insecurity fucks me up. It’s been almost  10 years of this bullshit now and I don’t seems to be able of going over it.

At first I thought that maybe I just should ignore it and try. I did. But the low self worth and insecurity always seem to catch up.

Being alone is my everyday and I’m actually getting tired.

Even now we're out of lockdown, so many people are applying for jobs, i'm getting rejection after rejection, or not hearing back at all and honestly, I can't cope anymore.

I'm not sure i'll ever be rid of this job. 

I'd give anything to just up and quit, but I can't afford to; I can't even afford to be off for my mental health, because the company took away sick pay as COVID hit.

I wish there was an objective test that could tell you with a 100% certainty what is happening because I don't. And going to therapy is just not working because I don't know what to say or how to say it. I want to be objective and truthful. I don't want to mislead anyone. Thing is I can feel myself forcing the symptoms sometimes but I can't stop me from doing it. It's like there is something in my head forcing me to do those things. I was never genuine. I think everything I ever liked or thought or how I behaved was forced. Now I am forcing this on myself. I don't know. Today was a fairly good day and now I just feel so frustrated about these things. These past few days have been a rollercoaster. I feel momentarily euphoric and then I don't.

179,"Apologies for the randomness of this post.

My 18 year old son broke down on me the other night.  He said he was very stressed about his course load - he's a freshman in college.  Well, he was a freshman... he was struggling with his courses being online and remote - his mom and I let him drop two courses, and later that day he broke down again and asked if he could drop the other two.  So he's unenrolled.

He's actually stressed about life.  He doesn't know what he wants to do, school or career wise.  I don't know what to say to him - we want him to be happy, and to not worry about choosing the path for the rest of his life, at age 18.  Our public school system insisted that our children choose ""career electives"" as high school freshmen - I don't know of many 14 year olds that know what they want to do with life - our sons didn't -  maybe that's a failure on our part as parents.

He's indicated that he just doesn't care any more... about anything.  Two of his friends group have moved away to college, and two more that he worked with are in college locally and no longer at his workplace (a fast food restaurant) so he has no friends at work any more.  He has social anxiety and attempted suicide 4 years ago. He mostly wants to sleep; he does play an online game with his friends when he can.  His exercise is limited to a half hour to an hour daily, playing with our dogs outside. 

He spent the long weekend with his friend that came home from college.   I'm concerned that he's being very hard on himself - he says he hasn't been kicked out of his friends group, but he expects it.  We're going to Zoom-meet his psychiatrist tomorrow. 

I feel helpless - I want him to know that he's supported while we work through this pandemic and that he doesn't have to have a defined plan for the rest of his life - that he will find some purpose in his life sooner or later and that he can be content.  But I'm worried about him giving up again... that he doesn't understand we care about him and support him.

184,"So with the state of current events in the world, I've had to spend a lot more time with myself than I prefer. And I have been unable to see my therapist. I only see therapists in person due to trust issues, but with the world situation therapists are no longer meeting people in person.

I'm starting to become tangled inside my own head. It seems like my depression and apathy are getting worse than they've ever been before, and parts of my personality that I've spent years burying are starting to creep back up.

last night I killed my sisters fish by pouring some bleach into the tank. The whole household, (apart from me) is currently away from home, visiting relatives.

Yes, I know, these actions are granting me a one way ticket to hell.

I don't regret killing the fish. My sister didn't take care of them the way she should have, often not feeding them, their tank becoming beyond disgusting, and just generally neglected them.

They did not deserve to die, but I felt like i wanted to do it anyways. and as i said, i don't regret killing the fish, the only thing that is making me feel bad about it is the risk that my family will find out they live with a monster.

In the past I've talked to my therapist about my desire to hurt people and animals. My therapist said that i can't be a sociopath or psychopath simply because i have an understanding of morals and what's right and wrong.   
but i don't think he understood what i was saying.   
while i do understand morality and ethics, i don't feel an innate natural desire to follow the common rules. ie. hurting people both physically and emotionally and physically hurting animals.   

---

I don't really know what to do with myself now. Even though they were only fish, i know that my sister had true feelings about them... She didn't want them to die, she just wanted them to live happy. and even though she neglected them, i know here feelings for them were there, but i killed them anyway. Only because i wanted to, it felt like something i needed to do.   

most people here will probly call me a piece of --shit-- and suggest that i rot in hell or put a bullet in my head, which to be fair, those people make a good point. I really do try to be a good person, following the common rules of morality   
&gt; Don't put others in harms way   
&gt; Don't hurt other people, physically or mentally/emotionally   
&gt; Always value an innocent life over my own   

the thing is though, i have broken these rules may times,   
driving while tipsy/high   
using dangerous tools while tipsy/high   
allowing my friends to drink and drive
hurting people emotionally, and toying with their mentality for fun   
manipulated people in ways that negatively affected them

Let me give some examples. People will make jokes to me a lot that I simply won't catch onto. Fart jokes for instance. I'll be the only one in the car that will force a chuckle and just hold my breath because it's nothing but gross to me. Even when I'm the perpetrator I cannot laugh, I just get super embarrassed. 

I'm a male so you can see how that may cause some awkward scenarios. Also running with that theme, I don't think I react to things romantically like most men would. I'm not super defensive of my girlfriend. Random men will talk to her and if I wasn't at the time it won't bother me really. Honestly I think if she accidentally kissed some guy drunk I'd probably let it go and act as though nothing happened the next day. I just wouldn't feel the anger I know I'm  supposed to.

When I receive something I really like I appreciate it but I feel like I offend the person who gave it to me because my reaction is never ecstatic. When I got my first car I just gave my mom a hug. I loved the car, and I love my mom to death, I just don't have that energy I guess.

I would like to know what therapy I'd need in your opinion (today I had a meeting with a therapist and she's suggesting me CBT..someone else told me I might have BPD..) but let's get to the story..

I (30) am in a relationship with a girl (24) and I do love her.

Though, we have been fighting a lot, since a long time, I know I want to make our relationship work, as I know part of the problem is surely mine.

I don't want to discuss what her part is, as I'm seeking strictly actionable advice on how to stop my toxic behavior of breaking up (this is the most important) and becoming avoidant or verbally hurtful during our fights.

It makes her insecure, and she's a very insecure person already, so this trait and behavior of mine will surely not help her to grow strong, to feel safe in our relationship, and eventually to bring me also the peace I need to have a healthy relationship with her, but also with myself as it is making me sad.

This fighting pattern is something I have since forever, and it's most probably related to the way I'd fight with my mother, as we'd get into fights and never talked it through, and stay apart for days, even when living in the same house.

This relationship is making me very sad, and I'm part of the problem, and this sadness is not allowing me to enjoy my life anymore, which is also a reason why I get so stressed that then I react so brutally. Still, I don't want to justify my behavior, but I know that I've lots of issues around my life caused by me, by her, and by other circumstances.

It's a hard habit I've to break, but what can I do? Any actionable steps I can start taking? What might be the cause of such behavior?

I want to fix this relationship, and soon, because if it ends, it will leave me with a deep sense of regret and sorrow, that will make me pitiful in the long-term. Things heal, sure, but deep down I'd always be feeling like a piece of shit, if this love ends for this behavior.

Then we were talking about how my parents would give me fines for things, like my mother would do my washing for me, as a child, and if I had discharge in my underwear, I would get a fine and have to pay her.
Then we talked about how I was always told they wished I was another child, they used to tell me which children they wished I was like.
Then we talked about how I could never really guess what mood they would be in when I got home from school, sometimes they would just be so mad at me, or other times they were my best friend. I never knew what I was coming home to, or how they would react to something. It was actually really confusing. 
They were also devoutly Catholic, and I was sent to Catholic school which I hated, and the strict Catholic views were taught at home too. 

It's not abuse, but suddenly I feel like the relationship I had with my parents had all changed, and I just don't know what to do. I feel all messed up inside now. All these things were deeply buried inside me and now they are out and I feel like it's tarnish everything.

I'm not even sure I'm looking for advice, I think I just needed to tell someone. It's like it's all bunched in my head now and I have just been handed this information and I don't know what to do with it.",07Sep2020,1
200,"For the first time in years I’ve been able to pick myself up from a negative point of view. Backstory: A month ago I returned to work after 5 months of furlough. Furlough helped. to process, self assess and take action. I am depressed and didn’t even realise it after years of feeling seriously dark stuff. 

I’ve had a really shit day today yet for the first ever time I’ve been able to pick myself up and move on without getting anxious and depressive. 

In my case a mixture of reflecting has enabled me to be a happier person to my girlfriend. My work, and to myself. 

Sometimes. Having time to think can make take you from complete despair to a sensible, happy person. 

I beg of you all to do that for yourself. We don’t all have the pleasure of getting 5 months but get out of your routine, take time for yourself, go and do something you enjoy and go and think about shit. Come back and be a happier person every time.

201,"My Dr has diagnosed me with PTSD.  Ive been reading a lot about psychotic episodes lately because I have them extremely frequently only with down times of a day or two.  My Dr knows about the episodes.  But I don't think the takes me seriously when I try  to express how bad all my symptoms are.  I cannot for the life of me do any work because the voices are so distracting.  And I can't help believing everything they say even though I know I shouldn't.  It's always degrading to me, and it's always in the voice of someone I know, and I always feel certain it's actually how those people feel about me.

I was casually reading about the different conditions that cause them, just out of curiosity, not intending to self-diagnose.  I'm no expert and don't know how to separate the descriptions of symptoms from the psychotic episodes from schitzo symptoms but I do know that the majority of my problems started around the age of 20 (or maybe 19) - I had some symptoms prior to then but I started with all the really bad stuff at that age.  My grandfather also suffered from very similar symptoms to my own (voices that he couldn't not believe, self isolating, and much of the rest).  I also have a lot of sensitivity to loud sounds an bright light and can only work on a computer where all backgrounds is very dark blue or black.  And any bright white windows I have to close or minimize, and just open to refer to then minimize them again.  My partner often speaks loudly or is very loud for the first few words speaking loudly and I cannot stand it it makes me do a severe cringe where I try very hard to lower the volume with my mind every time.  I much prefer soft voices, and my hearing is just fine so why do you need to raise your voice like that when I'm right beside you or only a few feet away?",07Sep2020,1

Now although I am in the lower third of my group (studying right now) I don't care about it, i don't know but I am literally like ""as long as I have my daily dose of Cola and Fast-Food I don't fcking care about it""

It's like I don't have an internal motivation to do anything at all, not even studying something other, not even achieving a career, or becoming perfect in a hobby or something. I literally just want to chill and nothing more

No, I don't take any drugs, I don't even drink alcohol and I also don't feel depressed, I'm actually enjoying life very much, it's actually the problem that I can enjoy life too easily lol

The funny thing is that sometimes very seldomly I get these spikes of ""spite"" or how it is called and get super motivated like in the past, you know this feeling of HAVING to prove others wrong. But unlike in the past when I've felt like that for 24/7 I maybe feel like that for an hour and then I just think to myself ""Fck it I don't have to prove anything to others etc""

One a day filled with these episodes where my heart rate reaches about 160 it last a minute or two until I black out. Anyways onto the story. So after laying in bed wanting to disappear I decided fuck it I’ll go to Andy’s (our local icecream shop) and get some icecream like the depressed fuck I am. So I go to get my icecream and I have this kid all the cash j had on me as a tip I mean after all it’s just money. I pull up to the window and everyone knows me turns out they were kids from my high and as stupid as it sounds in that monument seeing those faces  my heart filled with joy I felt almost happy for once.

204,For years I’ve pushed away my emotions and finding happiness in making others laugh. And I’ve often been able to not deal with emotions as they’ve never played a big part in my life. Now I find myself getting irritated and then it will lead to a depression if I can call it that. I know depression is a long lasting thing however these are short episodes where I’ll get very twitch and hyper aware yet spacey all at once and then this not sadness but an empty feeling. I’m not suicidal but I often find myself praying to be taken from this earth(I’m not super religious ether). For the first time I’ve told my parents and reached out for help they only know about my panic attacks because after a car accident that should’ve killed me they often worry as it only happened a week ago.

I was passively suicidal for 5 years, I was experiencing physical symptoms of anxiety (chronic stomachaches), I was severely dissociating and living in a daydream most of the time, my self-esteem was non-existent and I hated myself, and the list goes on.

I didn't get to see a therapist until much later. By that time I had recovered a lot, but I never got a formal ""label"" for the symptoms I was experiencing when I was younger. (Sadly enough, when I did try to get a ""label,"" the therapist I saw at the time said it was just a label and doesn't define me. I'm sure she was right in a way, but that did not make me feel too great.) 

I care a lot about fighting mental illness stigma because it made me suffer in silence for a lot of my life, but I don't know where I belong.

I have anxiety and ADHD, which already makes law school hard as it is. And recently, I had to move back to my childhood home because of COVID, which is making it even harder to focus on school.

My mental health has seriously declined since coming back. I grew up in an abusive household and I feel like I’m reliving a lot of my childhood trauma. I also get into arguments on a daily basis with my parents, they constantly gaslight me, and they refuse to believe I have disabilities (the denial is a cultural thing). 

I’m trying to save my money by staying here instead of moving back to NY and paying astronomical prices towards rent. But at what cost? I’m having a really hard time living here and I feel like I’m reaching my breaking point. Should I just take the financial risk and move out?

I didnt have a childhood with my father and my mother was the only one to comfort me growing up. As time went out any time i felt like i was doing well I somehow managed to fuck it up. Whether it be grades, my high school relationship, almost getting kicked out of college, becoming dependent on alcohol even though i said id never be like my father, or even now ruining my marriage with my wife and thus ruining her life. Looking back i cannot find any logical reason for all of a sudden doing things completely out of character that would make me unhappy and ruin my life. I had so many things going right for me but randomly do things that topple everything ive built. With my marriage its because I said terrible things about her to other women, making her seem terrible and then telling these other women I had feelings for them when that wasn't the truth. I was happy with my wife and although she dealt with mental health that I helped her get through i never spent time getting the help I needed. I take responsibility for what ive done regardless of what mindset I was in but I just don't know what to do. I live at in military base housing and she left eith our daughter back home 1000 miles away. Due to covid restrictions I can't even leave the state and she wants to get a divorce. I did not even sleep with anyone else but the damage had been done. Now she pours her pain onto social media and i am a joke to everyone. All i feel is pure regret. I hated myself since day one of talking to other people but couldn't find a way to stop. I wish i could give her a real reason like I was unhappy or I didn't love her to make this easier for her but that just isn't the truth.

I want to get better and I am seeking counseling but I find myself hopelessly lost with my wife. Some days we can talk to each other like nothing has happened and suddenly the conversation just becomes her reminding me how terrible i am. All she has to rely on back home is her friends and remaining family and i physically cannot go over there to help. I want to fix all of this regardless if it takes my entire lifetime but she keeps reminding me nothing will ever make her want to get back with me because now she can't believe a word I say.

218,"I've been an NEET for an year now, and it's the third, or fourth time I've ended up at home in my life (all physical symptoms due to mental breakdowns I believe, my memory is bad), I haven't been to an actual school in years, just tuitions, and exams. I have zero social life, and ignore anyone approaching me.

I have up, and down moods alot(my mental problems are beyond me to explain), I don't like being around people alot most of the time, when forced to go out, I end up so so exhausted beyond my limits. I won't kill myself, but if I were to rather wait until I'm distant enough from everyone in far future so no family members work gets disrupted.

Usually only music, and maybe anime, or so calms me, but even with that most times I just go eh I don't wanna do anything, especially not work, or study.  And even have to force myself to do ""pleasurable things""

They don't know too much about my mental state except for my physical symptoms driven from mental problems (which I take medication for), and maybe that I'm sad or down from my facial expressions (which I fake now because of that lol), or that have alot of anxiety issues.

220,"First real quick, its great that people are getting help somesomething free like reddit. This is more of me being curious.

Basically I think I'm a minor narcissist and wanted to know if im on base on that.

I'm extremely confident in very specific areas. I happen to be very confident in my ability to use my brain for things like debates or puzzles, and generally do well, reinforcing that idea. But the things I'm not confident in, not only do I concede those with no problem at all, but I also take pride in the fact that I was able to recognize that. (I know this is basically just pride hidden in fake humility) I do not believe I am disillusioned with the world, I think I see reality as it is, and not through a filter of me being the best. Exp.) Im open about the fact that I think im smarter than most of my friends but when someone demonstrates they know way more about something than me, I am very comfortable saying they are smarter than me on that. I have lost 2 friends as a result of this but when we talked about it, they could not give specific scenarios where I wasn't actually correct. 

This leads me to believe its my attitude about my confidence that they were upset about. This, itself, is something I'm personally patting myself on the back for figuring out myself, which contributes to the overall point of this post. I have the social wherewithal to recognize and stop doing that in all facets of life besides debates. 

Ig my main question is do you think I have something wrong with me because I need that consistent gratification, and if I don't get it from other people I need to suck my own dick about how much smarter I am than the average person.

221,"okay im gonna start this off by saying a few things about me. I’m an 18 year old male, pretty much a loner, but by choice. I don’t like people that much. Homeschooled, i listen to heavy metal music, grew up in a fairy stable environment (not too spoiled, not neglected, pretty normal home), and i, for some reason, have really bad explosive anger outbursts. Example, if something is a slight inconvenience to me it can seriously piss me off and throw me into utter rage. I often find myself being conscious of the fact that i’m in a full on rage, but if i tell myself to “calm down” that just makes it worse. The idea of calming down when i’m angry just makes me lose it even more. Anything that’s happy at all annoys me when i’m having one of these episodes. If someone hurts me, i will often find myself fantasizing about hurting them. (I would never take action). Normally, when i’m having these episodes I’m extremely silent and i isolate myself and i just ignore people if they talk to me. It feels like a constant inner battle and i’m sick of not having control over my emotions. I do not feel very much empathy at all towards humans, however i do for some reason have it towards animals. My pet cat is my best friend :). Also it would be good to point out that it’s not just common anger or frustration that i feel during these episodes. It’s full on psychotic rage. Is there something wrong with me? Is it just an inflated ego or may it be something more serious like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia?

I'm stressed 24/7 about him. I worry about his health and if he will harm himself. Neither logic nor emotional comfort helps him. I just don't know what to do. How do I help?

I've just started at a new highschool and I am very happy that I get a new chance to create a brand new picture of myself. Sadly those goals are slowly fading, because I am stuck between two personalities. 

One side of me is open, polite, kind and happy, whilst the other is more dark. I sometimes get this phase where I get very cynical, sarcastic, indifferent and dare I say nihilistic. I am bitter and sad, aswell as a jerk (not always, only in worse cases). I am stuck between what I want to be, that is: Charismatic, open and kind. Though it's not an easy thing to change, especially  when I've been the sad personality most my life. I feel uncomfortable when I try to be this happy and open person, but I want to be like that. I feel as if I can't, because people don't change. A person can not *truly* change, only pretend. I don't feel like pretending anymore, I just don't feel happy. Believe it or not, I am more happy when I am in my indifferent personality.

I haven't been to a doctor, and I don't believe I have som sort of personality disorder, I just act under false pretenses. There is also a chance that I have cancer, a miniscule chance but a chance none the less. This made me think about how meaningless it all actually is. Life is always a temporary thing, but knowing that my time might be shorter than I think made me realise that no matter what I'll do, I'm fucked. I just feel mentally tired all the time, I got so much shit going on in my head that I can't concentrate. I day dream all the time, of the ideal life that won't ever exist. That is all meaningless knowing I'll never experience those things in my dreams. But it's the only salvation I've got. 

I don't want to sound like some pityful emo that thinks he's a victim. But I've started with self-harm as some sort of relief, I don't know why but the stinging sensation of a whip against my back or a light slice with a knife is something that somehow fills me with joy and excitement. It might be the thrill that does that. 

Sometimes I believe that death is a far better fate than a painful life. In some situations I like the pain, It fascinates me, I've always been afraid of pain when I was a kid. And rightfully so, it's what makes life difficult. But without pain life isn't worth it. Without difficulty life isn't fun. Pain is fun, and life is pain.(sorry for this rant)

No matter how hard you try they always will. Either through broken relationships. Distance. Or death. Everyone always leaves.  It’s been the only constant in your life. 

I resent you and everything you are. Your just like that shattered mirror. Bits and pieces of people you’ve picked up along the way. Maybe that’s your way of not leaving them behind. 

You aren’t yourself. You never have been. 

I’m mean shit you’ve pushed so many people away i don’t think you know how it feels to be liked. People say they love you but they don’t really like you. And neither do you. You’ve become a tolerable person.

You don’t even know what to do anymore when people show you affection. Earlier in the car you almost broke. Nobody has done that in such a long time or even anything close to that. Same with the hug. If you keep people at an arms distance you’re fine. But once people get closer you completely drop your guard. And it never goes well

You’d rather be known as an asshole rather than someone with friends. To some people being lonely is scary because they have no one. But to you it’s great. Because then you can’t let anyone down and you don’t have to live up to their expectations of what you would or wouldn’t do. 

I regret hurting people. But it’s really for the best for them and yourself. It helps you keep a distance and it also helps them because you just leave a path of destruction wherever you go. You can’t hurt people as much if they are not emotionally connected",07Sep2020,1
233,"I think I'm suffering from depression or something similar, but I don't wanna label it until I got more information and opinions. Keep in mind please I'm only asking on here because no one would be willing to take me to get it diagnosed by a professional.

It's on and off, but I go through long periods of time where I got no energy to do anything regardless of the amount of sleep I got. Anything that I found funny, entertaining, or interesting don't really excite me. Typically, I'm the type of person who finds everything funny and constantly make the most stupidest jokes but lately I've rarely make any jokes, and when I do it's to keep people from (mainly my mom) asking me if I'm okay. I don't really have an appetite and I started giving up on my personal hygiene, and I'm pretty insecure and paranoid of what people think of me. Lately I barely remember anything also. I used to be pretty decent at remembering stuff, but now I'm lucky if I remember where I put my glasses. I don't really want to sleep either and force myself to stay awake until my body just shuts down and my head jolts backwards.

Any information, ideas, or ways to help with whatever I'm going through would be really helpful and appreciative.",07Sep2020,1
234,"So! I am curious about if what I'm experiencing is a hallucination or not. 

Essentially,  I'll see things out of the corner of my eye, like people walking, (usually shadow-like) or something moving around.  

If I look directly at these things I'm thinking I've seen, they aren't there. 

An example was yesterday,  I was waiting in the car and watching a movie.  In my peripheral vision, I thought a man in a white and red plaid dress top was stood beside the car window. I looked up, and nobody was around whatsoever. (This is a time where it's not a shadow, but there is detail,  like the shirt/hand)

Are my eyes playing tricks? Or should I be concerned",07Sep2020,1
235,"So this month is Suicide month (obviously). Last Tuesday I attempted. If got too much. Now today, almost a week later I was on tiktok and that video of that person who committed played. Now I’m triggered and I feel like I can’t breathe. I feel nothing (I have felt nothing for 6 months now). Now I’m hearing voices telling me to die. During the video I was smiling and then it happened. I immediately felt even more of nothing and now I want to cry but nothing is coming out. Did I just attempt today after that video? Yes. Will I go get help? No. I can’t. I’m fine now. Just 2020 is so hard. So hard. I should probably end this vent now since I think I’m disassociating again. I want to feel normal again.",07Sep2020,1
236,"So this might be long but this has been going on for a while now for no apparent reason I can put my finger on.

I am a master's student abroad away from my parents and family for a year now. I talk to them everyday and live with my gf in Berlin. 
No major tragedy has happened in my life that I can point at and say made me start feeling like this. However for the past 3 months now I always have sad and weird thoughts like nothing is going to work out in my life. Happiness is all but gone from my emotions and all the things which used to excite and inspire me just don't. It's like a lost feeling. I have started sleeping long hours and putting of things I should be doing.

I tried focusing on some of my hobbies but i just can't put my concentration on anything as of now. I tried talking to my gf about it and she says that I am just overthinking in my mind. She might be right but this feeling different than overthinking and it is actually starting to mess with my functionality.

I have been trying to get some part time or student job to keep myself busy but can't seem to find anything. My parents are not talkative type and don't want to burden them with my troubles as they might worry and can't even travel because of the virus. It would be really helpful to hear someone else's opinion on this and what I can do to make some positive changes.

238,"Hello, I am a 26 year old man. Who just recently allowed his unchecked mental illness to cost him the best friendship he’s ever had in his entire life. Allow me to explain. If you want to skip right to the actual story I will leave it very spaced out and easy to find in this wall of text.

So I’ve recently come to the conclusion that it is highly likely I have some level of bipolar disorder. Just to be clear, I’m not self diagnosing and I have an appointment on Tuesday to seek professional diagnosis. However after what happened this past couple weeks and upon looking into bipolar disorder; it’s symptoms and what it’s patients go through. Waaaaaaaay too much of my life made sense almost immediately. 

Ever since I was a teenager I’d have bouts of crazy depression lasting weeks-months that it would seem I would suddenly snap out of for no reason. Then it would seem some time down the road I would have bouts where I either 

A) am extremely productive, start several projects, pick up new hobbies, deep clean everything, do more work in less time at work, etc. 
B) become extremely irritable, I’ve constantly been asked why I’m pacing or if I need to do something. Will communicate or express opinions in a way where it’s almost a wall of sound that can’t be stopped even though that’s not my intention, I’ve had people get upset that “you were yelling at me” even though to me I sincerely and genuinely wasn’t yelling, I wasn’t even mad at them, I was just passionately talking about something. The worst of this state usually results in some kind of major family blow out or tensions in my relationships and friendships. I am very guilty of breaking things or hitting walls in select few circumstances in my life,       I am incredibly ashamed of this fact.           However, I have never and would never hurt somebody I love. My destructive behaviour comes from a place of self loathing and a desire to harm myself, not those around me. It usually stems from a “I fucking did it again, everyone hates me and I’m losing the most important things again”. This level of stress seems to be a common trigger that would push me from what I’ve learned to be called prodromal and then to manic. 

I’ve known for years that I need professional help, but never could bring myself to accept I likely require diagnosis and medication due to the own stigma I have in my own head of me specifically requiring that kindve help. But this has led me to lose the best friend I’ve ever had and I really don’t know what to do, I would do whatever it takes to mend things between her and I. 





So I had a friend, we’ve known each other since high school and have pretty much always been really close. However the past 2-3 years her and I developed an incredibly strong bond. She became my best friend and I became hers and it was pretty unquestionable. I was there for her through her heartbreak and she was there for me for all struggles. She was a huge influence in my starting to seek help back in March, she supported me and gave me the strength to swallow that pride I had and get over my own stigmatization of myself. However, my doctor gave me mirtazapine (even though I only wanted something to help me sleep not an antidepressant. As I mainly needed help sleeping after my grandfathers recent passing and didn’t want to seek other medication until speaking with a therapist and psychiatrist) and after about 2 weeks of that stuff I felt incredibly not right. First off I felt like I was tranquilized every day, but I was pacing all the time and just became really irritable. So I stopped taking it. Which really was fine, except that irritability didn’t really go away. This was around April or May. Now during all this time my friend and I were looking for places to rent so I could get out of the shithole town I was in and she could get out of her grandparents. Fortunately enough we ended up in a situation where we could rent to own the home. But there were many stress factors involved in this on my end that didn’t exist on hers. Anyways what I thought was normal amounts of bickering occurred in the first couple of weeks of moving in with each other at the end of July. During the talks to resolve these fights I made sure to explain to her very openly and honestly my thought process, stress factors, insecurities and just everything in general that I felt led me to contribute to making things worse. Things kindve settled and I was beginning to think maybe we really were starting to find our stride. But I was still irritable and not feeling right, sleeping 3-4 hours a night, up late cleaning for no reason, but still up and at it for 6am to work. She never noticed this cuz she works night shifts. But then something else happened that really fucked everything up....

She had a mutual friend over and they, really badly took advantage of her. When I got home from work that day she was really upset and I of course, was there for her. I felt so bad seeing her this way again, and due to the actions of one of my friends no less, someone I respected. And as I sat there helping pick up the pieces the thought crossed my mind that “man I can’t believe he’d do this to her, I would never do this to somebody” but the thought continued on and became “I’d like to help her pick up the pieces... and be the one to hold it together too“. I knew this was a problem. So I decided I would try to take some space and get over it. She asked what was wrong and I gave her a really half assed answer. Saying that I just needed some time to sort things out and that I’m not mad at you so don’t think that way. But things weren’t getting better. I don’t know why, but I decided to open up to her about it and tell her. I made sure to start the conversation with “I need to be honest with you about what’s been bothering me, I don’t expect you to say much and that’s ok, because the most important thing to me is that things don’t change between us as friends”. After telling her she said it was a big deal and asked if us living together would be a problem. I said no it’s not and I don’t want it to be. She went out for the weekend for a birthday, which I thought was perfect it gave me some time to myself. But when she got back things were markedly different. She locked herself in her room all day, wouldn’t go out for a smoke if I was on the deck, would hardly even look at  me, starting acting super shady about the people she’d bring over and go out with. After a few days of this I decided that I should take a couple weeks to stay at my sisters and give us some space. I told her about this and said “ever since I said what I had to say you seem very uncomfortable by my presence, so I think I’m going to go stay at my sisters for a couple of weeks, I just don’t think I’ll be able to do what I have to do and be here right now. And it’s not fair you’re uncomfortable” she said “I agree I think you should move to the basement”. I think this response really triggered something because I felt I was being completely pushed away. Anyways we discussed some of the problems with bills and what then she kindve stormed off and left for work around two hours later. I stewed in my own racing thoughts and forwarded her the email to swap the security system over and then snarky text messages were sent. I accused her of not caring she told me I’m psycho....I punched the wall. And that’s pretty much it, she came home in the morning I asked her if we could talk and at least finish things off. She slammed the door in my face, I screamed “thanks for being a fucking adult about all of this” (I know, real rich coming from the guy hitting walls). I got an eviction notice, began packing and left that evening. That was Thursday. And now she’s telling people she’s terrified of me and felt scared for her safety. Which is honestly what hurts the most because she knows I have a really deep insecurity about causing fear in people I love. I’m a pretty big guy who’s just naturally loud. I don’t want anyone to feel scared of me. Especially as a big brother, I want to be a protector. I know punching the wall was wrong but it’s not like she was there for it or had to witness me in that state...

I have had many turbulent losses in my life because of this. I’m tired of it. But this one really does hurt the most, I’ve learned that there is nothing better than a best friendship between a man and a woman. As strange as it sounds, I’m going to miss the days where we could platonically cuddle up together, talk about our hopes, dreams and insecurities and watch Disney movies. I just wish I didn’t allow my pride to keep me from getting help and so irreversibly fuck up this friendship. I really don’t know what to do or how to move forward from here. Because all I want is to make things right. I’m an idiot and I wish I never caught feelings for my best friend, I wish I wasn’t the way I am and I wish I could stop this from happening to me.",07Sep2020,1

Every single day is a disappointment in terms of me getting better. I just hope for one of two things: to be able to talk to some people ""freely"", and not with a mask. But I can't really... Whenever I am around others its like an instinct, and I hate myself for it. I never know how to talk to people, and even if I am in a conversation where I would be able to add anything personal I overthing it and I ""miss my chance"". And to find someone I can spend some time with. I mean I can't really remember having a person for more than a few weeks, and they just always ghost me... My day persists mostly of doing nothing and wasting time with stupid stuff I mostly don't enjoy. And I actually never told this anyone, but something that bothers me lately a lot: I remember when I was little, going to my dad and asking him to do something with me because I had no friends whatsoever who would do something with me, but even he turned me down and never did something with me. I just want someone to hold me... it would make my day, but even that will not happen I think.",07Sep2020,1

245,"Often when I'm feeling overwhelmed with negative emotions, I lay down and think how much lighter and better my chest would feel if I suddenly vaporized into nothingness. I'm not even close to thoughts about committing suicide, but does this count as being suicidal? It happens often.",07Sep2020,1
246,"Let me preface by saying it is not a constant feeling. Sometimes I feel as if my friends are just putting up with me so that they can laugh at me when I'm gone. And the people that are not my friends outright hate me and wish me no good. They're just good at lying and being ""polite"". When I feel like this I usually try to stay away from everyone as much as I can. Even when going outside I might believe that the strangers that were talking and laughing are talking about me. It's even worse in large crowds, where I can discern my name in between all of the voices of the crowd, followed with rude remarks and laughter. No matter how much I say to myself ""these people are not talking about me. They've most likely never even seen me!"", it doesn't stop it from hurting. This sometimes happens at school too. I can hear my name being mentioned followed with some rude stuff that I am insecure about while a bunch of people are gathered a couple of meters away from me. I instantly feel targeted and scared, but the peculiar thing is that when someone is back-biting, they're usually whispering. They seemed to be chatting quite normally and the snippets I caught (if they were real at all?!) did not match their tone and body language at all. Perhaps they think it's funny and casual to talk about me, who knows. It's high school though, teens aren't known to be the nicest people on earth.

Once or twice I started asking a close friend of mine if our mutual friends hate me, and if my childhood-classmates hate me too (long backstory with insecurity, mild s\*icidal ideation and slight bullying, can't type it out cause it won't do it justice). She said they didn't at all. I was (and still am) not convinced. After that, I tried to subtly introduce my fear of acquaintances and strangers alike hating me by sight. She said ""no, that's not possible"", and told me to seek help. My sister wants me to seek help too but I am sceptical. I don't know if I can trust a therapist. What about if they are lying to me about me not being hated? What about if they just give me a sense of fulfilment while not accomplishing anything to distract me? Anyways, I doubt that this is severe enough for a therapist.",07Sep2020,1
247,"My mom tries to listen but I don't like talking to her about a lot of stuff, and she gets annoyed with me so often that it just feels pointless to try and talk to her.

I feel like a shitty friend to my best friend in particular, because I always go to her for advice and when she comes to me for advice I just don't know what to say. 

I don't feel like I have a person to go to anymore. I'm so fucking worried about my health and I HAVE to do research because no one else will advocate for me. I'm just so tired of staying strong when my body feels so shitty.",07Sep2020,1
248,"I just saw a post that said that everyone on social media is happy but in reality no one is. 

And I realised, I haven't really talked about my own mental health issues ever on social media.

249,"I never used to do this, it started when I was about 20 and got a job at a call centre which I found really stressful, cringe and embarrassing and I was stuck there for about three years on and off. The job definitely affected my mental health because a lot of it was asking strangers in my city for their details re: property sales and getting yelled at a lot, and the pay was absolutely shocking.
 Ever since, when I'm by myself and stressed or embarrassed, like I've just called in sick to work (aged care these days, very stressful) or walking home from walk and processing a hard day, I'll start uncontrollably talking to myself.
It's almost like a tic, they aren't really proper sentences, it's repetitive and I often swear. They usually go something like: ""Fine, it's fine, just fucking fuck off."" ""For fucks sake just fucking kill me. No don't kill me but fuuuuuck."" It kind of looks funny written down haha. It's usually rapid fire out of my mouth before I can even think about it, usually at the height or peak of my ruminating or stressful thought train. I don't tend to do it around other people but I have caught myself sighing suddenly and loudly in place of when I'd start jabbering or saying ""Oh, dear' which has gotten people's attention before.

Sometimes I just have one outburst and I'm done but sometimes I'm talking like a deranged parrot for a minute. 

Is this normal, do other people do this? Like, am I a bit mad? I'm certainly not remotely a mentally healthy person but in general I'm pretty functional.",07Sep2020,1

Idk if this is normal, But like when I see a group of people I start panicking and want to cry. When i first started year 7 i got jumped alot by groups bc i'm cool and like I just don't like big groups of people In case they start. I'm in year 11 now (10th grade for u Americans, I'm from uk) and  when i walk my dog and I'm walking home and I see people, even if there younger then me and even if I know there not a threat, I'll just turn back round to avoid them even if it takes me 20-30 min more to get home. Like i feel like i'm being judge and just want to cry. And then in school, when we have seating plans I feel like people are mad that they have to sit next to me and I just feel disappointing. Like I apologies to them for having to sit next to me. I don't talk alot in lessons incase I get judge, but i talk alot at home so my parents don't really notice. And like, I want to talk to someone about it but idk how to say I'm scared of people.  

When I see groups of people I just want to go home and it kinda makes my friends less interested in me as soon as they meet in groups I just want to leave and idk how to explain it and I don't want to talk to my parents about it as I talk alot at home so they will probably feel like i'm exaggerating. But i walk a longer route home from school everyday (probably about 30min longer) As less students walk that way so i feel more alright.

I just don't feel alright seeing groups of people and I always feel like there judging me. So thats cool.

Also, my school doesnt care about people feelings unless you miss behave alot but I'm too scared to do that so like i just go unnoticed and it will just feel to cringey to me to talk to someone, you know?

I don't know how to explain it. I had the same problem 5-6 years ago and I don't remember how it went away. I was at the doctors last week and she just gave me some pills. The exact one I used to take when I was younger and would always feel sick after them. However instead of having to take them every day, she told me to take them when needed.

Today I had one an hour before eating (it says so in the instructions) but it didn't help much. I talked to my dad about my eating and how I just can't and he thinks I'm becoming anorexic. I don't know if I am or even think that. I don't avoid food on purpose to lose weight, quite the opposite. I know I need to gain weight but I'm so scared to eat food so it doesn't hurt.

I just feel so stressed and anxious and want to make it stop. And yes I asked my dad to get me special help but he doesn't want that so I don't take those kinds of medicine at such a young age.

255,"My sister (I'm not sure if I may put her age, but she is middle aged) has been struggling with a mental disorder ever since her teens. She has done many street drugs, and has been on nearly every type of prescription drug to treat mental disorders. Doctors have diagnosed her with a drug-resistant neurological disorder. She goes through what could be bi-polar disorder where one day she's kind, understanding, thoughtful, reasonable, and can take criticism - and the next day she becomes very defensive, interprets nearly anything said to her as a personal attack, is unreasonable, and argumentative. She has said that she experiences several emotions (negative emotions) all the time, and at the same time. She claims she is unable to cry because of the medicine she is on, and that she never experiences happy emotions.

I'd like to say what medication she is currently taking, but I'm not sure if that is allowed here, but I think it's okay to say it is a strong mood stabilizer. Doctors apparently feel she should not be on an anti-psychotic medication. She has also had ECT treatment. She insisted on having it done and my parents and I believe that has done severe harm to her mind.

She has been in a ""psychiatric hospital"" multiple times, and now has told us that if she is ever put in a hospital again she will kill herself. So we feel we no longer have that as on option. She is willing to see therapists, and has been for some time now.

She is functional to a degree. She is mostly able to care for herself, but is not able to be self-sufficient. She relies heavily on our parents for emotional support as well as financial support, and has put extreme stress on us. We want to help, but don't know what to do at this point.

She has used many drugs over the years mostly hallucinogens (LSD, DMT (Ayahuasca), shrooms). She's taken marijuana for her whole life - now often as CBD. The only concern I have with the marijuana is what a dealer may add to it - she's mentioned one time she believes she smoked some that was treated somehow with formaldehyde. I don't think she's ever done any kind of opiates, or uppers thankfully.  I mention this because I honestly feel that these drugs have done harm to her mind.

She just recently lost the place she was renting, and this is what has set-off what she says is the worst crisis in her life. She found a place to rent (2 bedroom, 2 full bath, with a large yard) for an amount that she could afford (around $850) located 9 hours away. Our parents and our other sister paid $4000 to move her things and cover other various costs. When she arrived, she said the place was a dump and the area was awful with trash everywhere. She refused to move in and went to a motel. We ended up having to drive over there to bring her back. We looked at the place and I felt it was more than reasonable for $850/mo - in fact, I think it is larger and nicer than my current place.

So now she's back and currently living at my parents house. I doubt that will last much longer as she can't stand to be there. She says that she must find a place to rent for around $1400/mo (she has $2000/mo of income) that is 2bedroom/2bathroom with a yard and accepts pets. She said she will find a roommate to split the costs, but she wants to live in a rural location which I feel will make it very difficult to find a roommate. She refuses to live in a suburb like area as she says it frightens her. 

There's much more I'd like to say about her and her situation, but this is already very long.

I appreciate very much everyone who reads even part of this, and also any feedback.

I honestly feel she wants us to reject her and tell her that she's on her own so that she can have an excuse to end her life.

i don’t even know where to start. i’m just venting. i’m a messed up person. i’m depressed and probably have dissociative identity disorder and i’m just so unable to provide for anyone let alone myself. my boyfriend has been basically caring for me through long distance, but his parents don’t like it. when we were first together i was pretty fine. i was somewhat happy and definitely not as messed up as i am now. i presented as female, too. we kept it a secret until we were found out by my parents and they weren’t really happy. but things were fine with them after a bit but then slowly my mental health got worse. i self harmed and felt horrible. i transferred schools and was better, but still felt like a complete piece of shit. i started to explore my gender identity and only up until january of this year have i figured out i am a boy. flash forward through all the covid stuff and then to this summer. my boyfriend and i finally got to visit. my mother went with me and she watched me on the tracking app every time my boyfriend and i went out alone. my boyfriend’s parents said they needed to talk to him about the trip, but it never happened until today. they told him they feel like he is putting in more than he is getting out. they're a bit put off by the lack of please and thank you, and when they gave my mother money for the trip she didn’t acknowledge it (mind you she didn’t really want it anyways and it wasn’t my place to say anything). his mom also thinks i am manipulating him when i had a dissociative episode a few weeks ago. i have self esteem issues no doubt and everything that’s been going on lately with my mental health just hurts so bad. i’m just a terrible person and i can’t provide for him. i don’t have enough money to get him things like he gets me. i’m not stable enough. i can’t drive and even though i’m working on it, it’s still really hard. i’m in counseling but it doesn’t really help and we’re on our way out with it since i’m “better” with the things i originally came to her for. i just feel so shitty i can’t even describe it. i want someone to comfort me but i don’t deserve anything. i just want to crawl in a hole and die. i don’t deserve life or attention or love or anything. i just.. need to get this off my chest..",07Sep2020,1

it was summer. I don't remember the date or what day it was. The song Asleep by The Smiths was playing. I was wearing a pair of gray sweatpants and a zip up hoodie. I laid down on my bed and took a old shoe box, filled with souvenirs and other memories. At the bottom of the box was a steak knife or whatever its called. The saw like one. I wrote a note to my friends and family, took the knife to my wrist and made a cut. It wasn't deep enough so i just kept cutting with the rigid knife. It hurt so bad but i didn't mind because all of the pain would be over soon. I just kept going until i hit something. I laid down again. The song was still playing, but all i could hear was my blood, dripping down my arm onto the wood floor. I started to get sleepy and feeling light, yet heavy at the same time. Then i was hit with this panic. I saw the floor, i saw my hand, and then i froze. There was blood everywhere. I still remember the smell like it was yesterday. It smelled like coins, but a very specific type of coin. The blood felt cold on my wrist. With my other hand that i had tried to cut too, but i was too weak to do so, i grabbed my wrist and put pressure on it. I didn't know what to do. I went to bathroom and put my hand under the water. That hurt too. After a long time, the bleeding stopped. I ran to my room and put the knife in the box, took my sheets and cleaned the floor. I threw the sheets in the wash and bandaged up my wrist. My hands still feel cold. I can still smell the blood. I can still feel the knife against my skin. I can still feel the panic. I can still feel the bleeding. I haven't listened to The Smiths since. I still have the knife with my blood on it. I still have the pain.

I’m 17 years old and I’m struggling with so much boredom that it constantly sends me into a spiral. My anxiety is off the charts constantly. I just feel like I’m waiting for every day to end so I can fast forward to a good day but nothing really changes. I have almost no friends, and whenever I think of the past I feel an overwhelming sense of dread. Everything is bothering me at this point and I’m so confused. I’m just a teenager and I think about death all the time. This just feels so wrong... I can’t get out of this funk.

260,"So, to start this off I wanna preface that, since lockdown, I have suffered with what can only be described as debilitating anxiety. It’s been very much like that of a wave - really good times where all my worries seem benign and my anxiety symptoms are low or not there at all and other times where I’ve just been crippled with anxiety. I don’t want to go into great detail about everything that’s happened since lockdown regarding my anxiety, as this would be too long and I don’t really like to dig up and put what I felt into words as I sometimes feel that it’s counter-productive for myself personally. 

It started with panic attacks that were a 50/50 mix of being triggered or just occurring randomly. I have (self-diagnosed) health anxiety. I say self-diagnosed because I feel health anxiety is very specific and hard to misinterpret for something else, it’s almost like saying I have a self-diagnosed cold or headache, the symptoms are typically self-explanatory and rarely chalk up to a bigger thing. This caused me to have extremely irrational thought and just have this constant dread sensation in my stomach. The idea of a serious illness was absolutely crushing to me, to the point where even entertaining the thought of it or seeing something on an ad or someone saying something in a video would cause me to feel light-headed and intensely anxious. It still does. I did everything to help myself and I think I did improve, it took a while, but I’ve definitely done things that have resulted in me being more rational and generally calmer. Aside from the odd panic attack (that seem to be centred around my migraines), I’ve been okay - definitely better - I feel that’s all that needs to be said regarding my anxiety history. One more thing to preface: I had only experienced something like this period when I was young, like 12-13 but I had no clue what it was and it ended up passing. 

Now, into what I wanted to talk about. After a long-while and after everything I stated above, we are in the present. Recently, this feeling of very unpleasant, existential dread has taken up a lot of my days. I question everything around me, the meaning in life. I feel like “is anything worth it?” “Is anything truly special?”. Everything looks different since my anxiety started. I’m okay, I’m not depressed. But I wish I had this sort of naivety that I had prior to my anxiety, where I was good and I didn’t have to question the validity and meaning in everything. I just don’t know what to do. 

Death terrifies me. Every time I hear that someone dies in the news I feel almost sick with dread. It’s not necessarily the thought of not existing that terrifies me, it’s just the prospect of death - I can’t put my finger on why. It just elicits this horrendous response in me where I almost feel sick. Prior to all of this starting, I had no trouble in accepting my fate and my own mortality but now it seems to me like this stomach churning thing. 

I don’t know, has anyone got any advice or experiences anything similar

261,"I lost my thing recently. And no matter what I try to do to get it back or make it try...it floats farther away. 
I see something serious in this thing. It was my reason to live and for a while I thought I was its reason too. 
My anxiety started getting really bad...
But then this thing started getting into things behind my back...keeping them a secret...lying about it. 
And when it started doing that, we started slipping. 
It talks about how it just can’t do certain things, but the whole reason it became my thing was because we had that level of connection/communication. 
I need to tell them whats going on and what I think but they don’t want to listen me. They dont want to talk to me. 
So I try my best to cater to what they want in the time being
And they get mad at me. 
And it hurts so bad. 
So so so so bad.....
And now they don’t even want to work on our friendship for now. 
I don’t know what I’m doing wrong
I don’t know where I went wrong
I know my anxiety made things hard
But I was really trying the best I could...
 
Now I’m on medication
And while it helps some, it hasn’t been long enough for the full effects to kick in. 

I just want to give up...
I want to stop trying...
I want to die...

I want to because I want the pain to stop...I’m trying my best and then they just shit on me...

264,"Listen, so I'm not saying that Jessica from middle school wasn't depressed, I'm just saying that maybe she wasn't diagnosed.

I know so many people who straight up lie about their mental health. And like not in the way i do where i say I'm not suicidal or that the flashbacks are gone and i totally sleep. I'm talking faking OCD, DID, anxiety, depression, ptsd etc. I had a friend, let's call her helen, who told everyone she had attempted suicide when we were at school. She said that the cops showed up and all that other bs. I'm someone who has actually tried to kill myself twice, so i know the protocol in these situations. I didn't say anything because she was my friend, but it really made me angry. Everyone was talking about her FOR DAYS.

I just don't think that it's ok to take advantage of stuff like mental health and suicide, when there's real people who actually battle with this all the time.

I am seriously not ok in that front. Like many diagnoses not ok. You know how much attention i expect and receive from those? Zero. Nada. It's really fucking insensitive HELEN.


The other thing is people who self diagnose. I think i don't need to say more, my fellow unstable people get why it's not ok or good.

266,"I am worried as hell and don’t know what to do

Hi there!
This will be a bit long so please bare with me. About 6 months ago, March 2020, I (20F) performed oral sex on a boy who was a virgin, not a drug user either. After this intercourse, I had no symptoms but for some reason I started to worry. Maybe it will sound dumb but I started to worry because I thought what I did was wrong and that I deserved to get some type of disease for it. This was my mentality and I looked for symptoms all over my body. I developed tonsil stones, mouth ulcers which made me insanely worried as hell too. On July 2020, I had check-ups and routine blood tests done (complete blood count, wbc etc.) and everything was perfectly fine. For some reason I couldn’t get illnesses out of my mind. 2 days ago, I noticed some weird stuff in my throat, red spots that weren’t there before.

Here’s the link to the throat pictures: https://www.reddit.com/r/medical_advice/comments/inu623/help_why_is_my_throat_so_red_no_trouble/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

: https://www.reddit.com/r/medical_advice/comments/iog4b7/is_this_hpv_or_herpes_tested_neg_for_strepcovid/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

I immediately went to an ENT, tested negative for both strep and covid. I had a blood test as well, wbc was perfectly fine. Monocytes were a bit high so my doc said that it was some sort of minor viral infection like the flu or common cold. However, I always get the flu and never develop these type of stuff in my throat.
I got worried about HSV and HPV. Sidenote, I am vaccinated against HPV. I don’t have a fever nor a sore throat.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I would like some peace of mind or advices about what may be going on with me from you. I would also love suggestions on how to improve my extreme hypochondriac mentality right now.

Me and my friends have a twt gc where we talk about alot of stuff, and once when i was at work i checked the gc and they were talking about the Wes Johnson ( smosh) allegations and didnt put a tw so i had a panic attack at the bathroom.

294,"Hi there. Cut along story short. I've suffered with anxiety my whole life, started when I was 5 and I am now 28. I was diagnosed with GAD, OCD, AD and psychosis a few years ago. Been taking medication for 6 years, been to see countless therapists. Anyway I'm now in recovery and got my life in order. My only issue that's left now is my family. My brother took the route of drugs years and years ago because his friends did, and he got hooked. There was years of abuse (physical and mental) from him. 2 months ago, after his 4th trip to rehab and him leaving early because he was bored (no I'm not kidding) I finally got him out of my life. My dad was a twat, chose women and drugs, got rid of him also. My mum I tolerate because I love her, but she's an extremely selfish lady as well, always choosing alcohol over everything else. Then there's my sister. My sister I've always had sympathy for, but tonight I believe I have lost any sympathy I had left. She's in an extremely toxic relationship with a man that she's always fighting with, but chooses to stay because he gives her what she wants material wise. Clothes, shoes, holidays etc etc. About 6 months ago after coming off a 12 hour shift, I got a phone call from her. She'd been out drinking and had yet ANOTHER fight with her boyfriend. She thinks it's a real party to ring her recovering brother that she wants to kill herself, so I spent 4 hours calming the situation down, crying down the phone to her begging her not to do it. I offered to call the ambulance for her, she said no, so I just spoke with her. I went to bed and had to be up in 3 hours for another 12 hour shift. On my break I looked up all this information, helplines etc to send her when I got home. I sent her them and said you will find a lot of help and guidance from these people. Well she ignored me, she ignored me because her and her boyfriend made up. I didn't hear anything for over a week and all I got was ""awww thanks yeah I'll look into it"". Anyway fast forward to tonight, after months of not even getting a message to ask how I'm doing, how my partner's doing....nothing. I get a message saying ""I'm gonna do it. What would work best?"" I immediately rang my mum and told her and said you and her have been out drinking haven't you? She said yes and that my sister has YET again had a fight with her boyfriend and wants to kill herself. However this time I can't get involved. When I saw the words ""how should I do it?"" I had a really bad panic attack, all the bad memories of the couple times I attempted suicide, it's triggered so many bad thoughts. I can't get involved with this, and part of me says I'm right to do so, but another part says I should. I've rung my mum and said you need to deal with this, you know how she gets when she drinks and you chose to go out with her. She said she was going to ring her and talk to her. I don't know...I don't know what the point of this post is, I think I've just reached my limit with my family and I needed to get alot off my chest. After tonight I really want to get rid of her as well, like I did my brother and dad. All of them are a huge reason for why my mental health is so bad. And even now, when I've moved 200 miles away, they drag me into their self inflicted drama. This is the worst my anxiety has been in weeks, and it's because of...once again, my family. 

Sorry for ranting.",07Sep2020,1
295,I feel like I've been being way over possessive over a friend I have after she hooked up with a guy. I dont even really have a crush on her or like her in that way that much but isk why but that shit sparklesh u r tsparkles like i was absolutely devasted and idk why. I think it might be because of my insecurities because I've never even gotten close to having a  romantic relationship with someone. But to get to the main point I can't stop worrying about it and idk why. Like know its none of my business and I know its so so so so SO fucking yoxic and stupid of me to be worrying about this but I just cant shake this feeling of dread thinking about it. I've tried researching how to deal with jealousy and insecurities but I've already tried those steps and I still have this dread thinking about it. I suspect I may have BPD (borderline personally disorder) but I haven't been tested so there's no way to be sure. How can I make myself stop caring whay she does? I am pretty sure thid could be a problem with my insecurities but how can I stop those from making me posesive?,07Sep2020,1

297,"Is anyone else really struggling at the moment being on social media? 

All over any social media i’m on its just so full of homophobia/ racism and other mental health stuff that i find difficult to deal with and its just all so triggering but i still want to support BLM but then it just makes me see even more videos of people being racist and Im struggling to want to stay in a world with so much hatred and evil. I feel i shouldn’t feel this way because I’m not black and haven’t been oppressed but i feel so awful for them especially when cops who are suppose to protect people clearly don’t. 

I’ve tried staying off social media but i feel i have nothing else to do as it use to be a place for me to escape my own problems but now it causes a lot
of them. i hate the online world and the real one. i feel so lost. corona isn’t helping either. 

i hope this makes sense and someone understands me. i didn’t really know where else to post this as everywhere else online feels unsafe to me. 

thanks for reading if you got this far.",07Sep2020,1

299,"It’s obvious they are putting things and my food. They keep telling me I’m a hypochondriac but I know they’re lying, they’re all lying to me.. the doctors, family, friends, everyone is just lying to me about my symptoms. They made me get Migranes and stomach issues because they put things in my food, they want me dead. I now have the urge to constantly pee all the time and had a migraine for weeks after having a big argument with my family about my mental health. They did this to me, they’re just trying to kill me because they hate me and I know it now. I don’t know how to stop them but they’re trying to kill me.",07Sep2020,1
300,"I (24f) was diagnosed with adhd and aspergers when I was a kid. I have always struggled with keeping my spaces organized, starting, switching, and completing tasks, tackling larger projects, procrastinating, self motivating, remembering to do things, and recognizing that things need to be done. I had never really looked further into these things, having been told all my life that I would 'outgrow' the symptoms. Until I tried moving out recently, I had a set schedule of small things alongside individual tasks that would be sprung on me whenever my parents took the notion.
When I moved in with some friends, this had become an issue where my chores were getting done late or even not at all until someone asked me about it. I have since moved back with my parents. While I was there, I started looking up how to maybe fix the issues I was having and stumbled upon Executive Function Disorder, something I had never heard of before but as I read about it, it seemed like I was relating to everything I was seeing. It turns out that this can also be a symptom of adhd. So the way I saw it, if it walked like a duck and sounded like one and you knew there were ducks in the pond, it's probably safe to call it a duck! There was some closure in knowing that I wasn't just lazy and that there were things that could be done to help the issue other than having someone breathe down my neck and tell me to try harder. 

My (possibly now ex)bf (25) got irritated with me about a week ago when I posted a few links to adhd resources in our household's group chat about how to work around executive dysfunction problems and said I was just self diagnosing and giving excuses for not doing house work because I ""don't want to do it"". 
He has had problems with family members of his who would say they had this that or the other due to looking things up online. The way he was talking, he feels I am just being lazy because he's seen me do things in video games and help moderate a discord server without issues.

I was actively trying to get the other people in the house to understand what I was going through and trying to get help in making things like lists or something to make sure I get things done in a consistent and timely manner. The other housemates were willing to help at first until it blew up into an argument between me and him, with the others seeming to side with him.
I would appreciate any feedback on this I can get.",07Sep2020,1
301,"My SH urges are skyrocketing. As of right now, I have been clean for 3 days and 17 hours and that's going to be messed up soon. I hate urges because when I relapse I can't help but feel and believe that I am disappointing everyone more than I usually do. My closest group of friends act like they care about me in the slightest bit. If they truly care, I don't believe it. I simply acknowledge what they have to say while dismissing it. I hurt myself on call with them and they don't know what's up with me other than the things I tell them daily which barely scratches the surface. I just hurt and so does everything. They don't know that I hurt myself on call and it will stay that way. I firmly believe and think that not a single person will miss me. No one cares, I don't matter, I'm not worth it, blah blah blah. I've been slowly isolating myself from everyone so hopefully soon when I attempt again, they won't ""care"" as much because I've drifted off into the background/sidelines of their lives. I bring enough negative energy around them by solely existing and none of them needs that. I'm doing them a favor. I'm going to make their lives easier and this world a better place by killing myself.",07Sep2020,1
302,"I honestly have gotten to the point where I hate getting out of bed, and have lost all of my appetite. When I tell my parents I feel horrible, they give me advice such as taking walks. I was diagnosed with arthritis a few years ago, and can barely walk. They tell me that I am lucky and that some people don’t have such loving parents, and I know that is true but it doesn’t make me any happier. My depression started a couple years ago, when my little sister was a still birth. They are always arguing with my sister or each other, and never have time for me. I cut myself when I am really depressed, and I try to tell them, “hey I feel like cutting and I haven’t yet” and they just tell me good job and forget about it. I honestly can not get mentally better unless I get away from them but it is pretty hard to do as I am only thirteen.",07Sep2020,1

Hello! 

I’m a young health professional who has just been through his first psychotic/manic episode, during which I wrote my first fiction book! It has what I like to think is a super unique plot loosely based on my mental health saga. 

It’s an action-packed adventure/psychological thriller/sci-fi.

The best part is that it’s available for just one dollar! 

Here’s the synopsis: 

On a tiny planet in a distant galaxy, warfare has evolved to the point that the mind has become a literal battlefield. As power-hungry warriors leap through eyes and seize thrones at the back of brains they create slaves and build armies. Sixteen year old Kahu is thrust from his peaceful external life into a chaotic internal world when his tribe is destroyed by Centre-Point, leaving him as the lone survivor.  
 Although his family are dead; they live on within his head. Armed with four defenders internally, Kahu meets a powerful beast who gives him an ultimatum, forcing him to unite the remaining tribes and lead a siege upon Centre-Point or risk extinction of his new tribe. As he meets other leaders Kahu discovers the truth, while growing more powerful with every fight.
