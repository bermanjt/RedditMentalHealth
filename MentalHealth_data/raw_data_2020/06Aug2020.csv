0,"I've gotten so super paranoid with the pandemic and I was able to deal with it as I trusted my family to be clean. But recently my parents decided to renovate the bathroom much to my complaints. This has caused so much stress and paranoia for me. The builder coming in and out the house to throw away the debris then returning to carry on with the work and my dad leaving the house so often to get supplies. I've caught people not washing their hands during this renovation and after I tell them I still see red flags.

This is ruining my life so much, I have been washing my hands so much that my hands have gotten so raw. I dont trust people in my household anymore. I know I am being OTT with my reactions but I cant help it. It's gotten to the point that I am losing sleep and being in a constant state of paranoia and distrust. The fact that covid is on the rise again isn't helping.

Literally this morning I spent an hour and a half going back and forth to disinfecting my room and washing my hands, all because my dad came from outside straight into my room with his shoes still on that he wore outside.",06Aug2020,1
1,"I really appreciate anyone reading this so I’ll make this post brief in return. Before I start though I think it’s important that I mention that I’m a teenager (17 yo male) just because I know mood swings can be common in teenagers, or at least that’s what I’m led to believe.

Basically, I think the best way to summarize what I’m going to say in one sentence is that my general mindset is often changing and feels somewhat unstable. One example being my mood- one hour I’m all happy and everything and the next I’m super irritable. This one is especially annoying because every time I become irritable (it usually happens at home or around parents, especially step-parents (although I generally like my step-dad but I don’t like my step-mom)), I don’t want to be but for some reason feel like I can’t revert back to a better mood. The last example of my “unstable” mindset would be my self-esteem. Sometimes I feel pretty confident and good about myself but I also find myself thinking a lot of self-deprecating thoughts a lot of the time. I’m also gonna add that I was recently diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

Basically, my question: Is this normal for a teenager? Thank you for reading!",06Aug2020,1

I feel like I don’t know how I am actually feeling a lot of the time . Or if I do I think I am making up the feelings . I sure as hell cant explain these feelings . This makes therapy / psychiatry hard . 
I had my first psychiatrist appointment yesterday. It was hard . I felt like I did a horrible job explaining my emotions ... mostly because I don’t even know what they are . They are all over the place . I don’t understand . He told me at the end that he believes I may be on the bipolar spectrum. But I don’t know . 
I started reading a lot about mood disorders ... personality disorders... all of that. I know I should t have but I did . I would read about things like bipolar and say oh yeah that applies to me in a broad sense . But I feel like the way other people view me and my emotions is so vastly different than I view myself . My boyfriend says I go from being happy / playful to extremely down extremely quick . But it’s not like every few weeks ... it’s like every couple of days .. I just have quick mood shifts . I have no clue how to explain this though ... it feels so hard to try and explain something to somebody you don’t even understand yourself. And I don’t want to be diagnosed wrong because I suck at explaining ... idk what to do... idk if anybody will even understand this...",06Aug2020,1
4,When I was 8 I was sexually assaulted. Althiugh not how you'd think. the 2 boys were 4 and 5. We were behind the hill and I was just stood there and they came up to me with a toy gun and one touched my ass and pulled down my skirt and underwear whilst the other tried to lift up my shirt. Its been 6 years. I don't think I'll get over it.  I also don't know whether this is the right subreddit,06Aug2020,1
5,"so if i get upset about something or just feel depressed and cry a lil bit, i will randomly just stop crying-? it’s difficult to explain but it feels like i turn a ‘switch’ and turn to an apathetic piece of shit. it could be as small as me crying because of a drama and the ‘switch’ will flick and i’ll have thoughts that i wouldn’t normally have and i can’t tell if they’re fake thoughts i create to make myself feel better or they are actual thoughts that i have? 

i know i’m not turning into a sociopath and whatnot but i’m just curious as to if other people on here do this too and if anyone has any idea as to why?",06Aug2020,1
6,"This is a really long post. Like, really long. I wrote it mostly for myself to help me process all of this. But I decided to post it in hopes of maybe it'll help one or two of you.

It has been a really tough year. At the end of last year everything in my life finally seemed to be falling into place. I got a huge promotion that earned me a leadership role at work. I was losing weight, I was working hard on my mental health with my therapist, hell, I was even getting more reading done than I usually do! Honestly, I was in a better place than I'd been in in years. This continued into January and February of this year, but then in March the company I was working for started struggling because of COVID. I was told that I needed to come up with a list of who I would keep on my team if I had to cut 75% of them. 

That week was hard. Gossip travels fast, and soon my team was asking me if they should be worried about layoffs. I looked them in the eyes and said I hadn't heard anything, even while I was making that list. A week later I was meeting with my manager going over my final list when a mysterious meeting got put on our calendar. The guest list was hidden. We both wondered what it was about. Thirty minutes later we (and 25% of our company) were told by our CEO over Zoom that if we were on this call, we were being laid off. IT locked me out of the computer within thirty seconds of the meeting ending. No saying goodbye. No getting contact info from coworkers. Over. I was a week from my four year anniversary with the company.

Now I've always struggled with depression and some anxiety, but it was always manageable by exercising a couple times a week, making sure to drink enough water, write in my journal--the little things. But after getting laid off, depression hit hard. In 2019 I lost about sixty pounds. Since I got laid off I've gained 20 of it back.

The anxiety was a slow burn though. I didn't notice how bad it was getting. After George Floyd's murder, a few friends of mine decided to go to one of the BLM protests in town--the chapter in my area was doing a car protest where we'd drive around the sheriff's office and honk and I was determined to go. The night before, I woke up at 2am having a panic attack. I'd never had one before. It was awful.

About a week later my parents got exposed to COVID. I became convinced despite their good health that they were going to die from this, so I drove down to help my sister living at home take care of them in quarantine. But really, I just knew I wanted to be there if these might be their last days. They have a fairly big house, so we easily sectioned off half for them, and had a hand off point where we'd fill up pitchers of water and bring them food.

Thankfully they never developed any symptoms, so after a week I drove home and started my own quarantine just in case. A few days later I couldn't fall asleep because of really bad shortness of breath. I thought, here it is. This was the risk I took for my parents, and now I got it. I have a hard time with doctors, so I waited a couple days to see if symptoms would worsen. Each night and for most of the day I had shortness of breath. Finally after one really bad night, I set up an appointment to get tested. What surprised me was that as soon as I got tested, I immediately felt better. That should have been a sign it might have been anxiety. I tested negative for COVID.

For about a week I was fine. But then the shortness of breath kept coming back every few days. Usually the shortness of breath came after obsessively looking at footage of violence at the protests that I was ashamed I wasn't able to attend. Finally after a week or two and a really bad night, I called my doctor. I had been reluctant, not only because of my weird thing with doctors, but I was ashamed that the last time I saw him he had been raving about how much weight I lost last year, and I didn't want him to see how much I'd put back on in so short of a time. But lastly I was hesitant because I'd been laid off! I no longer had my amazing health insurance, and was too mentally drained to look up and see what Medicaid would cover.

When I finally got in to see the doctor I was so emotionally and physically drained. I think he could tell and was immediately pretty sure it was anxiety. But just to be safe he gave me a lung X-Ray and did an EKG. The EKG came back slightly abnormal, so he consulted with a cardiologist who recommended I get a stress test done.

I went in for the stress test, honestly almost feeling dead inside by that point--convinced my struggle with obesity in adulthood had now ruined my heart. They put tracer in me so they could image my heart. I then got on the treadmill, and they told me that normally they'd rather have people just run until their heart rate gets up high enough. But because of COVID and the potential of aerosolizing the virus, they told me they recommended I take a special medication that would artificially stress out my heart instead. I really didn't want to do it that way, especially since even though I'm a big dude, I'm perfectly capable of running. But I also didn't want to put anyone at risk, so I agreed. Honestly, the whole thing was an awful experience. It felt like my flight or fight response was triggered. My heart started pounding and I was sweating while only walking on the treadmill. I hated it. Thankfully after all the tests everything came back normal, and the doctor told me that my anxiety was definitely causing my issues.

It felt like such a defeat to be prescribed medication for something I'd always been able to manage my whole life. Especially when I looked back at how I started this year! I would have been angry and frustrated if I wasn't so numb. Fuck 2020 I kept telling myself. As the side effects for the medication rocked me even more, I kept thinking, fuck 2020. As my appetite and libido dropped to nothing: fuck 2020. When I alternated between nausea and diarrhea: Fuck 2020. Insomnia? Fuck 2020. When on that third week my depression got worse than it's ever been? Fuck 2020. 

Today it's been six weeks since I was prescribed medication. I realized that I've finally felt good consistently for the past three or four days. I've been sleeping better, I've been responding to texts, I've even gotten back to working on my writing projects again. My mind is clearer. I've been cooking breakfast again. I went for a walk yesterday. My libido has even returned (mostly).

I know this year has been rough. I know it's put on hold a lot of things in our lives. I know there are so many awful things happening in the world right now that it's hard to even know what to do. But my doctor said he's getting multiple people every day with the exact symptoms as me. Anxiety and depression are hitting us all hard. Be mindful of how you're feeling, and don't be afraid to get what you need to survive. We need to remember to let go of what we have no control over, and be patient with ourselves when it's just too hard to keep going. Right now, for me it's a daily effort to stop hating myself for the weight I gained back and for the time I wasted on projects I was too depressed to work on. But I have to remind myself that I'm just not in a place to live my life as normally as I usually do. Right now my priority is to get better. That needs to be your priority too.

I live a very privileged life. Even with still being laid off, I'm lucky enough to be in a financial place that I've been able to make it so far. I know a lot of you are in worse situations and don't know what to do. I know a lot of you might even be in better situations but are still really struggling right now too. Don't forget to be patient with yourself if you've had to put projects or goals on hold. I think our achievement based society makes us feel like failures if we aren't constantly moving, but fuck that shit. At least for right now, fuck that mentality.

But if you're in a place right now where you aren't even worried about achievements or goals, and are just worried about surviving--right now I want you to make a promise to yourself and to me that you'll do what it takes to take care of yourself during all this. Because you fucking deserve it. If you need help, please reach out to someone. Whether it's a family member, a friend, or to me. I know how fucking hard it is to reach out. It's so hard. But think about the times when other people have reached out to you for help and how nonjudgemental and ready you were to help them. You deserve to feel that support in response to some vulnerability too. Have a good cry in the shower. Meditate. Workout. Eat an ice cream sandwich for breakfast (did that yesterday, highly recommend). Do whatever you have to do! If you've been looking for a sign this is it. You deserve to be okay. Do what you have to do to get the help you need to survive this. We'll worry about growing again once we're strong enough to do so. Until then, patience.

And while we're at it let's cut other people a break too. Many of us live extremely privileged lives even when we're struggling. You don't know what people around you are going through either. Be excellent to each other.",06Aug2020,1

Not as bad as last week but i get severely lightheaded, heart palps, arm pain, etc. But then the chest heaviness lasts for hours all throughout the day.

And when I get those episodes coming on I suddenly feel super nauseous and regurgitate up into my mouth. I will also randomly get breathlessness.

Ive had numerous ekgs, blood tests, and chest xrays. Everything seems fine.

I'm married (26, husband 27), and no kids, but my husband is on disability. Because of this he only gets paid once a month. I work a meh job where hours for me range from 20-35 hours a week, and I thankfully get paid weekly. He pays rent out of his check as its easier, and my check goes towards electric bill, my phone bill, internet bill, groceries, truck payment, and then anything he wants. I was working in the medical field before COVID hit and we managed fine, with money left over. Now, I honestly cant remember the last time I made a full payment on any bill. My phone is going to be shut off soon, internet will be cut soon, half the time I have to ask for help with the truck payment.
I work night shifts, and now am being told I need a day shift on top of it. He sleeps most of the day, leaving me to only get 2 or 3 hours of sleep when I get home before our puppy wakes up then I have to be up with her. Then I have to clean the house, cook, while he does absolutley nothing. Because of this I'm staying to resent him now. I love him to death but he doesnt help, doesn't see I'm mentally breaking because I'm stressed and burned out. I get no thank you for anything. No ""hey go to bed, sleep in today and I'll help around the house"". 
Now I feel like hes getting jealous or pissy at me because I have 2 really good friends at work that want to hang out outside the job, and that means I leave the house.

Before lockdown I met someone who domestically abused me from start to finish. It was “special connection”, “special boy”, “special love” to nothing from nothing. Yes I said to nothing from nothing.

I am in my 30s... so not a boy. Everything else I fell for.

It took me 5 months to realise this.

They stole both material and emotional things from me to make themselves look better. Could be anything from memories to shirts.

This person lied to me, punched me, body shamed me, situationally shamed me, cheated on me, got angry with me for respecting lockdown rules, manipulated me and emotionally blackmailed me even at the end.

This person always split answers. Things happened but according to this person it didn’t. My perspective was never real.

This person broke lockdown and job retention rules then went on to attend and even organise many illegal parties.

This person travelled over 4 countries in lockdown. Claiming they had special reason to. This person claims it was legal to do so. 

Questionable.

This person is always the victim yet smiles like normal away from the damages caused.

I later discovered this person is breaking housing and tax laws to fund a pretty nice lifestyle. Meanwhile others struggle. 

Basically renting out someone elses home without them knowing.  They are also receiving job retention money due to the COVID situation in one country whilst having little ambition to return to the job.

This persons “previous date radar” was a history of very upset people. Like me. Not 'just some person'.... I mean these people literally said they were “angry” and “upset” and “surprised”.

This person LOVES sharing pictures of themself, yet for someone who has ""always had serious relationships"" has no S/O history in the pictures. 

This person always wants to enhance their status with various things. Reasonable or not.

This person found new fictional problems after I demonstrated compromise.

This person emotionally blackmailed in the end once more which would have led me to a further 8 weeks of emotional turmoil. Specifically they said “I will call you on your Birthday”... What’s wrong with any time before then? 

During a small time apart this person was able to find another person to abuse in the space of 5 days. They then proceeded to send me a picture of this person and said that they were in another part of life. Later to demand that I came to collect them with other words that made me 'give-in'. 

Prior to that the last thing this person said “love you” and then went silent for 4 weeks. Which naturally left me to panic, searching, contemplation and self rationalising. The silence was grim, the first week my messages were marked as read, the second week they were unread, the 4th week I was blocked. The 3rd week I seen some sick joke on social media “here’s a picture of me and my partner.” It was a blank picture.

This person demonstrated a desire to amplify my emotions up or down at any given chance. It was hell.

This person has spoken ill of me to others. Not because I was ill, but to boost their self esteem. I am a reasonable person. I understand what a tone of conversation is.

I always maintained care but thankfully I had my breaking point. This could have been a long term domestic abuse situation which had I not broke myself from and seeked immediate help from mental health professionals.

A seperation and / or recourse was always welcome. I never got this. I believe this person was afraid to feel they lost the battle which never existed and couldn’t let go of the sense of worship that someone who cares will demonstrate.

This person took selfies of themselves behind my back as we took selfies together as a couple. I noticed this whilst looking at old photos. It was actually creepy to look back and discover this. It was like a ghost in the background kind of sensation.

My biggest mistake was staying around. This person considered mental health as a ""disease"".

This person claimed I provoked them to punch me. This person wanted to go home and I said ok let’s go. They punched me. During the relationship I was punched, nipped, bitten multiple times. 

I had gifts that were still in their package. Things that were important like nice crockery. They felt it was ok to open. Clearly gifts... but OK.

This person took childhood pictures that were in a photo album marked ""memories"", they used my personal memories on their social media. Yes we had moments of good together, but these things were too far. Time together 4 months total. I did speak up at the time gently which caused friction. Whatever.

This person created an emotional and physical conflict when there is none to be had.

This person posts photos that really shouldn't be online with messages attached to them. 

Example...

“Great people and you’re not there” Even though I was literally standing right next to the person and was one of the dates we had during lockdown.

This is a person who demanded that I participate with group calls to her friends and family but would not with mine.

This is a person who appears to have broken lockdown to arrange a birthday party for themselves. 

I believe this person lied about their nationality.

Now my work has suffered and I am writing this post to process these problems.

I have anxiety, panic attacks and bouts of depression now.

This type of relationship is a bad relationship and you should never enter it. Look out for the red flags such as someone saying  “We have a special connection” when you don’t know that person.

Online dating is where I met this person. I have complete regret for the first time in my life.

I have let go despite how this post may sound, I was smart and identified the problems inflicted. Had I not grasped these issues maybe the small successes this person had when achieving a sense of worship for their actually insignificant life may have got much worse with time.

I am in recovery mode, and I have detailed all the important things should I have to call the Police.

43,"I (23 M, Trans) feel like this has always been a bumpy road for me. When I was younger, I did crisis counseling, and was transitioned from that to a psychiatrist. He was a family friend, close with my parents, and talked far more to my parents about me than he actually talked to me. I was hesitant to talk to him. He withheld my original diagnosis, seemed to change the terms when convenient, and refused to revise medications or provide me tests or update my diagnosis. Some of these things he said he couldn’t do, but he wouldn’t provide me any resources. I got frustrated and stopped seeing him, but now I feel more lost.

My general doctor has tried me on a couple medications but part of my issue is keeping schedules and taking pills, plus, it isn’t her area of expertise, I could only guess and she would try to prescribe me things she thought could help. Nobody seems able to give me actual answers. So many symptoms I have seem to overlap with multiple possibilities, so online research feels useless, but I can’t just walk in to a clinic and take a test - as far as I know - and I am often dismissed by any doctor I see that isn’t my female general doctor. I've tried dealing with it myself, but I can feel myself slowly crashing, and I can see it starting to affect my work and life far stronger than before, and I need to do something about it before I become incapacitated.

I just want to know how I can deal with this. For reference, I am an adult in California. I don’t know if I can take tests, or if I need to see a specific doctor to just take in all my problems and give me back what’s wrong, and what on earth I can do to have people take me seriously.

So, what can I do to seek an official diagnosis for my mental health problems? How can I get people to listen to me, and take me seriously?",06Aug2020,1
44,"The last few days I have noticed my daughter sleeping more than usual, isn’t playing too much with her dog, and something just didn’t seem right. 

I went to her room this evening, we talked. I have always told my kids to talk to me, no matter what. I want to help my babies in any way I can. I tell them daily I love them. I have always sense she might like the same sex. And I have always said to my kids “I will love them no matter what” as long as they’re happy, I am happy. My husband has also told them this. 

Well, my daughter told me she’s been feeling tired, has no motivation, she loved to draw, and now she doesn’t want to. She feels pressure at school to fit in with the cool kids. Pressure about going off to college. And with everything  going on with Covid, she’s been worrying more than usual. 

As a mother, I want what’s best for my kids. But their happiness is more important than anything else. I am calling her doctor tomorrow, maybe they can give me some advice or  send us to the right doctor.

45,"My mother is seriously mentally ill and my brothers and I don’t know what to do. Tonight she had a manic episode and called me balling crying telling me to come home (I live at my girlfriends) and of course i got a little startled and asked what’s wrong. Well she said my younger brother aged 20 threw her down and seriously injured her. So, i’m asking questions and trying to understand what was going on because I know she can be dramatic. 

Backstory: That same brother is depressed, dropped out of school, rapidly gaining weight, etc. Well she’s been on his case every day about going walk, getting outside, doing chores, stop playing video games, etc. and she’s not very nice about it. I once witnessed him going back for seconds at dinner and she yelled at him for not sticking to his diet and threatened to send him to “fat camp”... She thinks she’s trying to help but she only makes things worse

Well I heard from my other brothers that she was yelling at aged 20 brother threatening to kick him out because “she doesn’t know what else to do”. She told him to call our dad (our dad blocked her because she was constantly fighting with his wife over the phone) Well he had already spoke to our dad and he was trying to tell her that when she got in his face and tried to grab his phone, andddd he pushed her. She fell down because i’m sure she was intoxicated, from what it sounded like over the phone. On the phone she tried to make it sound like my brother lashed out upon her and that he needed to get picked up by a mental institution.

My brothers said she kept coming back and antagonizing them and my oldest brother (aged 26 still lives there because he’s blind and has microcephaly) told her to go in her room and not come out or else he’s calling an ambulance to pick her up. 

Our phone calls always end up with “it’s my dad’s fault that my brother’s depressed and that I need to call him or else she’s going to put a restraining order on my dad for 2 years so he can’t go to my youngest brother’s graduation and then block him on all our phones.” (so much for being injured ??)

i’ve been dealing with low self-esteem for a very long time, i used to hate myself so much to the point where i sometimes cry. i wasn’t bullied nor i get a lot of hate. but i get mistreated by people, not immediately but when they get “comfortable” around me. a relationship for example. and to be honest, i’m very traumatized and i’m now in a defense mechanism mode. and not only that but now i have an extreme self-love, i think i’m better than anyone else and i don’t let anyone get on my way. you might say its a good thing but i find it strange, cause i see myself a goddess and people that are not close think the same way. everything that i say and do are always right. i sometimes feel like i’m responsible to correct people and change them cause as i said, i think that i’m better than them. and no, i don’t treat them wrong. i’m aware of that, but i’m a bit aggressive. i don’t know if its my defense mechanism or i’m getting better? IF its a good thing and i’m not seeing it or its because i’m not familiar with it. also, when i get rejected i get offended like WHO are you to reject me? 

today i was thinking about my actions and my personality and i thought is it bad? cause i’m really scared to develop it even more. but the thing is, i feel so much better and happier i really don’t know what to feel about that so i decided to ask here and know your thoughts about it",06Aug2020,1

I've had an attempt in the past and I really don't want to hit that spot again but I don't think I  can trust myself.

Now they question if I'm actually happy being in the family and I really can't answer that. Sure there are those obvious and big moments that make me happy (graduating, getting awards, etc) and the happiness that is obtained through entertainment (games, sports, friends etc) , but in general I don't understand the concept of being happy outside of those moments. Is something wrong with me? They always say that I love myself before my family, but I don't think that's the case either. I don't really love a specific aspect about myself and I don't know who I am other than what people have told me. I just feel like another person and I don't really feel meaning towards my existence. I don't understand the point of living or why I try so hard to succeed. I've had suicidal thoughts but never acted on them due to a fear of God (religious family).

Hello everyone

I am trying to surrender to the flow of life. But what does that mean? I do not feel like I can surrender to a Christian/Judeo type God. But the concept of Daoism kind of makes sense to me.

I guess I want some kind of way to comfort/reassure myself that if I surrender to life, I will be safe. But I feel like I am kind of missing the point of surrender.

Also, how does someone ""surrender""? I feel like I cant change my emotions, I cant make attachment and fear just disappear. The only way I can think of to surrender is to consciously choose not to put any effort or energy into my fears. Basically cant control thoughts so control your actions,

Anyone have any thoughts on this? Sorry I feel like I am rambling incoherently but its difficult for me to phrase exactly what I am trying to ask.

To be more specific I am asking about how to surrender when confronted with fears such as death, injury, or any horrible life event.

Next day I tried taking a sleeping pill again but it didn’t work, I didn’t even get sleepy, but I tried falling asleep anyway. I ended up sleeping for about 3 hours but as I was falling asleep, I had a weird hallucination where I was a famous person taking pictures and I remember tilting my head from side to side while laying down for like an hour straight. 

Today I had a meltdown and tried falling asleep despite the house being super loud and me being super angry. I ended up falling asleep and when I woke up I had a hallucination where I (claimed) I was blind and in the hallucination I thought blind people communicated telepathically and I was hiding under my blanket. I was also (in those moments) hallucinating my room being super windy, so my blanket was windy.

68,"So, bit of context here, I'm turning 23 this year. Just finished mandatory conscription, and will be moving on to University very soon. In my current state, I would describe myself to be suffering from high-functioning depression, as well as panic attacks.

Might seem like a bit of a cliché but it all started about a year ago after a breakup. I was together with my then girlfriend, who before we got together, was my friend of at least 4 years. I would describe our relationship to be pretty special because we were classmates, and during those 3 years, we were both dating other people. Ironically, both of us never saw each other as potential suitors, but had more of a brother-sister kind of relationship. But once we graduated from high school, we went to a grad trip together with some of our friends and things kind of just developed from there. We talked a bit about the possibility of getting together, and shortly after our trip, it eventually happened.

From here on (2018), she would head to (my soon-to-be) University to begin her degree, while I'll be entering the army for mandatory conscription. Things were surprisingly perfect between the two of us, we got along well, shared numerous hobbies and interests, and if I recall correctly, up till the point where we broke up, we had never ever had a fight. That was how compatible I felt we were, but come to think of it, that probably stemmed from years of friendship. Things were starting to get serious between us, we met each other's family and at one point even started planning for our future together.

So eventually, 1 year passed (2019) and things were still smooth sailing, we developed our relationship both emotionally and physically till the point where I was sure, she was the one for me. Fast forward to about June of 2019, this was when things started to go wrong. If I hadn't mentioned, she is currently pursuing a degree in the field of Engineering, so I'm probably sure you can guess the gender ratio. Couple that with the fact that she is really beautiful (not me being bias, throughout the time I've known her, I've seen a handful bunch of guys coming up to her to ask for her number, etc.). It's also only reasonable for her clique of friends to have a majority of guys, and a minority of girls. Not that I had any problems with it, I wasn't insecure about it, because I fully trust her.

Alright, enough digressing, back to the main story. So about June of 2019, she was getting ready to head over to another country for a 1.5 month summer exchange in an overseas University. A week prior to leaving, that's when it all went south. I can't recall the exact date for her flight, let's just assume it was on Sunday, so obviously I only had a 6 days (Assuming it's Monday) to spend time with her before she was gone for 1.5 months. One thing to note that I haven't mentioned, is that she has this really bad(?) habit of prioritizing her friends over her significant other, I've noticed this when we were still in high school, and she was dating another dude. If shes given the choice between hanging out with her boyfriend, or hanging out with her friends, she would most definitely choose the latter. I think that's one of the reason why she broke up with her ex as well lol.

So yeah, you could probably predict what's gonna happen next. Due to my schedule (army, ugh), and hers, we could only meet up on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. So we eventually set a plan to meet up on Thursday. So on Wednesday, she texts me and says that she can't meet up tomorrow, and here is the mind-blowing reason that I still do not comprehend up till this day (mind you more than a year has passed, and I still can't process it in a way so that it sounds logical to me), and I quote ""I can't meet up with you tomorrow, because I have to accompany my friend (female), who is going on a date with some guy she just met, to lunch. Everyone in our clique is going so it means like I'll probably have to go"". I still remember the exact reaction I had in my mind, ""what the fuck?"". So basically, her friend is going on a date, and said friend asked the clique to accompany her so it becomes a group event, hence it might become less awkward between the two potential lovebirds. Don't think it's over yet, she then tells me that she can't meet me on both Friday and Saturday as well because she needs to go with her clique to prepare stuff for their overseas exchange.

At this point, my mind was blown. So I asked her ""Are you seriously not going to meet me before you leave for 1.5 months?"". And things escalated and we eventually started to fight, I lost my temper and she lost hers as well, I ended up scolding her (I know, I could've done better), and one thing led to another and we decided to take a break (such a cliché), and she said that we'll talk about it after she comes back. Obviously that didn't sound too right to me, she'll be gone for 1.5 months, are we just going to ignore the issue for 1.5 months? That's just a recipe for disaster isn't it? So I texted her that we should most definitely meet up on either Friday or Saturday, even for awhile, like 30 minutes or so, to hash out and talk about the problem. So at this point, she literally just tells me shes not comfortable in facing the problem (I guess some bad experience from her previous relationship, she was in a pretty toxic relationship with another guy before we dated), and she just ghosts me.

So she flies off, I gave both of us some space to think for a couple of days before texting her to check up on her and to see if we could talk about our fight. So this basically becomes a cycle (couple of days to think -&gt; text -&gt; repeat), and eventually you can guess it, we officially broke up (at this point, I had a suspicion that her clique and encouraged her to do so), and we told each other that some time apart might be best for us, we'll probably revisit the topic of getting back together after some time of cooling off. At this point, I was still a-okay, maybe because of how I haven't really come to grasp with the the reality of the situation.

After a week or two, I texted her to check up on her and to talk about the possibility of getting back together. At this point, she just told that ""You're not the kind of guy I'm looking for"". And oof, that hit really hard. In hindsight, she probably made that decision after some convincing from her clique (pretty normal I guess, if you see a friend suffering from a breakup, you'll probably tell him/her that their ex wasn't right for them, etc.). This was the point where reality really hit me, and it hit me hard. The thought that I truly lost her, the person who I thought to be ""the one"" for me.

So this was the start of the downfall for my mental health, the following month was the lowest point in my life, although not clinically diagnosed, I am 99% sure I was suffering from depression, and I even gained 8 Kg of weight in a month due to not taking care of my health. So in an effort to pull myself up, I blocked her on social media, so I do not get reminded of her in any way or form. After maybe 4 or 5 months of slowly getting over her, I guess I was better. But don't get me wrong, I was still pathetic, albeit comparatively better. So fast forward to Feb of 2020 (this year), I was drinking alone and I had this urge to go to her social media to check her profile out. Biggest regret ever, because this would completely destroy any effort I have made throughout the past few months and possibly plunge me deeper into the sea of depression.

You probably can guess it now, she had gone into a relationship with a new guy (I think it was a guy from her clique). I can still feel, up till this day, how I felt at that exact moment. I think this was my first ever panic attack, I couldn't breathe, my throat was tight, my heartbeat was accelerating and I had this sense of the world ending all around me. How could my friend of &gt;5 years and girlfriend of almost 2 years, do this to me and move on from our relationship in less than 6 months? Was our relationship that insignificant to her that she could move on that easily while I am still stuck here drowning?

Throughout the next few months, I would suffer from random panic attacks if I think too much about the subject. I can even recall the worst one, I was just sitting in the bus, but my mind started to wander and BOOM, another panic attack. In my mind, I would picture the photo of her together with her new boyfriend. In the same time frame, my depression would get worse, not to the point of suicide, but just wishing that I could stop existing and stop all this pain.

Of course I tried to help myself. Over the course of the next few months,I told myself to stop thinking of her, to stop thinking about what happened and to try and forget everything. Guess it worked out well, my mental health significantly improved and I started to take care of myself by exercising, picking up hobbies and all that good stuff. My depression would get better in this time frame, and my panic attacks became really rare (only when I start to think about the subject again, which I absolutely avoid most of the time).

Moving forward to the present (aka at the time of this post), I'm about to enter University. I'm guessing because I have some slight anxiety about this new phase in life (whether if I can find new friends, whether I can cope with my studies, etc.), and transitional periods are times where mental health degradation is most common. My panic attacks and depression are starting to resurface. Mainly due to the fact that I'm literally entering the same University as my ex (although I'm not in Engineering, my faculty and hers are pretty close to each other), my fear that I would bump into her, or worst, her together with her boyfriend, does not help at all. The previous few days I have literally zero interest to do anything, and all I keep doing is thinking about her again.

So yeah, there's that. Its been more than a year and I still haven't gotten over her. Come to think of it, I still haven't managed to move past the overall event. Any ideas on how I could help myself?

 Alright, I'm done venting, and I've got to say, definitely feel a tad bit better. Thanks to those that took the time to read (if any).",06Aug2020,1
69,"My anxiety is at its highest in so long and it feels like a sucker punch. My friends and family are all so excited for my performance (outdoors, socially distant of course). Music has always been my passion and this’ll be my first gig in two years. 

But, I’ve also been very busy and also stressed due to being reenrolled in college courses. So I let myself procrastinate and have hardly practiced. Hell, I just finally threw a setlist together today and it isn’t even long enough for my whole show time. I messed up my meds recently and feel my depression slinking around. It’s what’s made me so apathetic to it all, yet the anxiety has me dreading and panicking. It’s so confusing and obnoxious.

I don’t want to do this gig. I’m not ready. I was too stressed to prioritize practicing, now I’m too anxious to even want to do the gig anymore and getting too depressed to care. I don’t feel excited or a genuine desire to do it anymore.

The urge

Hello fellow redditor,
  Currently I’m having a problem where my mind tells me to go back and research up things. Specifically it’s telling me right now to look up a website of the demon felericious. I remember going to the website and asking people. I don’t remember weather or not it was a website to teach the reader how to summon him or how to worship him but as for now I’m telling my mind that if it was to summon him it wouldn’t work while If it was how to worship a demon then that’s fine with me but my mind really wants to know what the website is all about.

Also when I even or ever do find this website my mind soon finds another bad thing for me to do so it’s pretty much “endless”

What can I do and also is this OCD? 

Note:I’m getting help soon from my mental just need help for now",06Aug2020,1
72,"  My school highly values mental health as a vital aspect in student growth. To enact on this, we have a class called wellness, which teaches us a bit about physical health, but most of the course is based on mental health and how to take care of it. The whole goal is to show students that although they may be overwhelmed with work, the school still cares. 
  One thing my school does to try to teach us about mental health is giving us work like slideshows or other presentations, which we get marked on in powerschool. Obviously, a bad mark will give a student stress to deal with, which pretty much eliminates the point of the whole class. Recently, a few days before COVID-19 we were given a lengthy slideshow project to reflect on our thoughts and how we take care of our mental health, how its condition has been recently, etc. The project did have other things, like two slides about goal setting blah blah blah, but for the most part it was generally mental health.
  To get to the point, we were provided with a due date that stretched a few days into isolation. This was where my trouble came, as I was confused and not really doing any work. When the due date finally came, I was auto graded to zero since there was no submission from home. Ever since then, I could not stop thinking about this bad grade. I come from a family which puts very high expectations into my academics, so it was a BIG deal. 
  Conclusion: It's ironic, a class with the intent of helping care for my mental health has instead hurt it with this bad grade on PowerSchool. Really, I think a class with that intent should instead not mark students, as marks are the main cause for mental health problems in schools. If you think this class is taking the wrong approach, feel free to start a discussion. If you think this is the right approach for the class with helping us regarding mental health, please state your reason why you so. Before anyone says, I am not complaining about getting a bad grade, but using it as an example for this issue.",06Aug2020,1

77,"I have never been diagnosed with autism and wouldn't say I have a lot of the symptoms. The few that I do have - like hyperfixations - feel like they may more likely be ADHD. I am a 21yo woman with CPTSD, OCD, anxiety, and depression (as well as fibromyalgia and endometriosis). The CPTSD is the worst and usually triggers the other issues. I experienced trauma from a pretty young age as I was developing as a kid (sometime between age 4 and 15).

I've been struggling with focusing during quarantine and have read more about ADHD because of this. I have a lot of the symptoms, but the attention issues could be a mix of dissociation from the CPTSD and fibromyalgia fog. However, I have hyper fixations - I always assumed it was an OCD thing, but these fixations are on things I enjoy. What I'm really curious about is that I also notice that I stim. Usually it's in ways that aren't super noticeable (tapping fingers, bouncing my foot) but sometimes if I'm really really excited, usually about whatever I'm hyper fixating on, sometimes I'll flap my hands. None of this has ever been out of control or a hindrance; it's easily controlled in social settings. I guess I'm just curious if any of my diagnoses are associated with stimming or if this level of stimming is considered ""normal."" Like I said, I feel like I have more symptoms of ADHD rather than autism, but it's really hard to say for sure whether that's from dissociation/pain (and being unemployed from the pandemic) or a separate diagnoses.",06Aug2020,1

79,"I am 25. I still live with my parents. I have no job. Haven't had one in 9 years. I flunked out of college. Haven't done much of anything since. I can't even make myself do the dishes regularly. I've been spending 80%+ of my day in bed lately.

I believe I have ADHD, Anxiety, and Depression if not Bipolar Disorder. Type 2, specifically.  I could provide my reasoning if it would help any, but if I put it in the post it will be way too damn long.

Earlier this year I finally talked to my mother about it. She said she believes me and wants to help me, but ""we cant afford a psychologist, and no psychiatrist because I've seen people on medication and don't want that for you"".... Then the pandemic hit and made finding help for me even harder, but like 6 months after we talked she finally finds a free Christian counselor for me. He was...a cool guy. It was a pleasant talk, but he pretty much just said all the things I already new from the internet, and recommended I get professional help. Mother already said no professionals so I kinda just...gave up after that, until a few days later my mother says she's actually looking into getting me professional help, so I thought maybe there's hope after all, until I look up the name she gave me and he's just a Christian counselor, but this time for money... So I call her out on this and she says we have no insurance and can't afford proper professional help, if I want it I have to pay for it.

The way she has talked about my problems though I don't think she actually believes me. This was made most obvious when I found out she told the counselor i was ""having problems with anxiety and depression"" but nothing about the suspected ADHD or Bipolar Disorder. In other words she told him about the things that are also regular emotions and not the ones that are only caused by medical differences.

Last year I knuckled down and tried to get a job. It would take all day for me to psych myself up to apply for one or two jobs, and then I'd need a few days rest. Never got an interview, and the few people i talked to made it very clear that someone with virtually no experience who's been lazing around for 9 years is not exactly someone they would choose over...pretty much anyone. Ever. So in order for anyone to hire me I need to...get a job...so yeah I have no idea how I am supposed to fix that. I even looked into a program for people no one wants to hire run by my local hospital, and I even know one of the people involved in hiring for it. Still went nowhere.

I don't know how to fix this anymore. I've been trying to fight this, trying to do better, for the last 7 years, and have only gotten worse. I don't want to have to conciously fight myself tooth and nail to get even the smallest change in my life that I'll drop within the year anymore. I don't know how to get better from here.

Somehow ""got better"", I've never attempted suicide again even though I have had suicidal thoughts. I have also diagnosed myself with some sort of eating disorder, not entirely sure. I was fat, since I was a kid until like 2 years ago. Back in highschool I had what I call an ""anorexic slightly bulimic episode"" that lasted for around 2 months. Two years ago after a traumatic situation I shifted somehow and changed a lot of things in my life, regarding food so I started losing weight. I obviously got obsessed at some point and used unhealthy methods, several times throughout the two-year journey, but always found a way to come back to ""normal"" and try to be healthy. So now I've lost around 50 lbs, and I KNOW in my mind that I do not look the same way I did two years ago, I KNOW I'm not fat, I mean I'm 5'5 and I weight like 135 lbs, I couldn't be fat even if I wanted to.

91,"I have compiled almost every resource I could find out there + my own experiences, into a simplified 3 PART list - ***before*** a problem, ***during*** a problem AND ***after*** a problem. I'll be posting parts 2,3 soon. Hope you takeaway something useful and implement it.

**PART 1** \- ***before*** a problem

What I mean by ""*before""*  is that the fore-mentioned points should be used as a checklist before  you even encounter any problem - **Preparation for future adversity**.

**theory**

* mental toughness is a learned ability
* mental toughness is something you not only build, but also maintain through constantly testing yourself
* mental  toughness not only depends on how you react to extreme situations but  also how you react to small everyday circumstances going wrong

&amp;#x200B;

**Attitude checklist**

* other people will NOT take care of you - they don't owe you anything
   * *you* work for what *you* want
* only compete with yourself from yesterday NOT with others
* accept that your plans can be disrupted
   * prepare for hypothetical situations where things go wrong
* don't worry about pleasing everyone
   * strive to be kind and fair, but learn to handle other people being upset if you didn’t make them happy.
   * say NO or speak up when necessary.
* calm down
   * you are not afraid of fighting - you're afraid of people judging you
   * at  the end of the day, if you have a good/bad performance in any task,  people are gonna get over it and move on to the next day which will have  another fight/another drama etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Embrace opportunity for discomfort**

* never lose an opportunity to grapple with a problem
   * use every problem - practice learning from AND practice bringing order back
* identity a belief such as ""I can't do this.""
   * choose to let that thought go.
   * plan and execute what you need to do.
   * win - by accomplishing what you set out to do OR learning something along the way
* train mental strength when you are at your lowest point physically AND mentally
   * when you're at the breaking point - note down what you did to push through
   * it teaches you to keep going even after you feel done.
   * examples - fighters
      * when you’re  tired and sparring partner is getting the better of you, that's your  chance to train your mental toughness by still continuing
      * Lomachenko's  father dropped him off in the middle of a lake when he was younger -  even after depleting his gas tank he still had to swim to get to the  shore OR drown

&amp;#x200B;

**Routine to follow**

* meditate twice a day
* gratitude journal
* list and remove people/activities that cause my problems/negative emotional states
* don't make impulsive decisions - think before every action
* start small
   * embrace extreme heat and extreme cold
      * saunas and cold-showers
   * deactivate social media
   * Stop instant gratification practices
      * find the thing that you know isn’t truly serving you but you LOVE and give it up for a week
      * video games, porn, alcohol etc.
   * sleep on the floor once in a while
   * take the stairs instead of the elevator.
   * sit in the car without the AC or heating on.
* train combat sports
   * consistency
   * work on a schedule, not just when you feel motivated.
   * can you take a couple of beatings and still come back",06Aug2020,1

For a long time I have been an obsessive when it comes to illness, from mental disorders to the most obscure health condition, I have probably felt like I had it a some point.

This causes severe anxiety for me, I panic and sit up for long periods of time reading about seemingly minor symptoms and connecting them with many different illnesses.This is getting worse recently and I can't stop thinking about small things that happen.

As of late my focus has been dry patches of skin on my body.These patches are not itchy, sore, very red, or outstanding in any way, yet I am obsessed with them.

I have spent HOURS searching forums, health articles, official sources, and more.

I can not cope; any spot, mark, headache, bruise, or cough all cause me panic.

Should I seek help?, This is making my ability to feel okay near impossible.",06Aug2020,1

Thousands of low paid migrant workers in Singapore are now reportedly suffering from mental health issues.  Most of them have been confined to dormitories with low levels of sanitization and airing facilities. 

Due to the ongoing pandemic situation across the city, the city administration decided to shift the whole migrant population to dormitories in an attempt to he contain the increasing number of virus cases. It was in April itself that the sprawling housing blocks were sealed off to the migrant population. 

Even now, some of the dormitories remain under quarantine. The prolonged state of confinement has lead to deterioration in the mental condition of the workers.  These also include those who might be virus free but are troubled over uncertainty of their jobs.  According to Deborah Fordyce, president of migrant rights group, Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2),"" We have heard of cases of extreme distress due to the inability to provide for families, inability to service debts to money lenders and banks and inability to fund medical care for children and elderly parents.”

I was on Lexapro for about 4 months. The first 3 months on 10mg and the last month on 15mg. The medication wasn't helping, so me and my psychiatrist decided I should try a tricyclic antidepressant (amitriptyline). Before starting the amitriptyline I did quite a fast taper off Lexapro. I went straight from 15mg to 10mg. I then spent 10 days on 10mg. I then spent 4 days on 5mg and 3 days on 2,5mg. When I went from 5mg to 2,5mg I started the amitriptyline but I didn't like it at all. The amitriptyline made me feel very weird and therefore me and my psychiatrist decided to discontinue that. However, since I had also tapered the Lexapro I was suddenly in a position where I could quit everything. I took one more dose of 5mg Lexapro because I had the ""brain zaps"", but in my next appointment with my psychiatrist he told me that he thought it would be better if I stopped taking the Lexapro alltogether. 

I want to trust him, he's a doctor and he had studied for this. On the other hand I have read online that tapering slowly is better and that this taper is too fast (I basically tapered off the last 10mg in exactly 7 days).

not being on adderall and abilify and chain smoking every day is so different from this experience!

""how are you feeling emotionally?

I am feeling ... the word apprehensive sprang to mind. I just smoked some ashes out of the trash can. I always expect this shit to make me feel better. Wait .. maybe I do feel better. I’m trying to remember what life was like 30 mins ago. But it’s kind of difficult because this feeling has changed every aspect of my experience down to the eye feeling, the feeling in my feet, my back- my brain area too and how it feels to form thoughts. It’s different now that I have - I guess I smoked the weed as a way to trigger myself into being okay and cool with just chilling in bed. Like when I’m not high , i have two conflicting feelings in my body- the feeling in my thoughts is kind of like a yanking feeling where I’m bordering on the verge of giving into any of my addictions, berating myself or being super demoralized as per my shitty fucking life situation(Carrying the metal rod with me and being forced to carry myself like this literally all the time is extremely exhausting), or getting up and actually doing something that’s going to make me money or be better somehow. So that’s the thoughts. They’re going in many directions and I can sense them all at once. It’s overwhelming to have so many things I feel that must be attended to given the body situation I’m dealing with. Overall though- my main desire is to be active and positive and do all the right things perfectly because I really do have the sense that I’m doing great and things are going to be really great. 

It’s too difficult to remember the specific body sensations when I’m sober but it’s very weakened without a dose of adderall. My body is a huge obstacle to overcome. It’s very very cumbersome to move around and sometimes I only feel comfortable enough to even think straight or feel okay if I’m lying down.

I’m kinda curious is that adrenaline the few months of that rush the real I don’t feel satisfaction ?

For substance I’m a gamer ok, and I really was grinding to get a item it to me 3 weeks I was extremely happy I finally did it. Then I said well what’s next. 

So do you think me chasing adrenaline messed of my dopamine receptors or maybe the tbi. I’m confused just feel alone. 
Like nothing I was or do gives me that urge ya know. 

There is two thing I know for a fact that can give me the urge flips in any extreme sports, and trad rock climbing or lead clips being almost upside down.

157,"Hey guys, for the past couple of years I've been really struggling with depression and sadly there has been a couple of times when I tried to end my life. Three months ago I decided to write a journal and put everything that was bothering my spirit in there and turn it into a novel. I wanted  those testimonies to be my last piece of pain so I can move on mentally. Personally writing helped me a lot over this past year and I wanted to share my journey with you guys. I don't know if you'll relate to my pain or if it will even save someone but I do know that it saved me and I hope someone can find peace from journey like I did. My goal now is to at least save someone like I saved myself, if you're interested or know anyone that would be interested I'm going to leave the link down below. Thank you for listening to me.

159,"One of my older brothers (M34) is a handful. He's always trying to borrow money. Can't find or keep a job. He's regularly depressed. He always plays the victim and takes zero responsibility for anything. Lately every word from his mouth is a lie, or a setup to make a future lie more believable. I'm being literal. 

I'm not a doctor, but i think he may have Narcissistic Personality Disorder. His behavior matches every description I've read identically, but as I said not a doctor.

How can I get him to see someone to help him? As I mention he doesn’t work so he doesn’t have health insurance. My parents have offered to pay for it, but he refuses. I just don't know what to do. The whole family has come together on this, and we are at our collective whits end.",06Aug2020,1
160,"Hey everyone. I hope you’re having a great day!

If you’re not having a great day, just remember, it’s okay to talk. Talking about mental health is crucial. Many people around the world are struggling to open up about it. Many people struggle on a daily basis. It’s never too late to talk about it, there is someone there every second of the day who are willing to take up their time and listen, including myself.  

Talking about mental health is extremely important. 
- It will make YOU feel better within yourself. 
- It is always okay to talk about feelings and emotions. We are all human. We will understand you. 
- Talking about it is the first step to breaking the stigma and pain. 
- Being open to others can get you a lot of help and support. 
- Talking about Mental Health can reduce the feeling of shame that you have inside. 
- It’s okay to show that you’re struggling. 

Mental illness is NOTHING to be ashamed of, neither is taking about it with someone. Mental illness is common, anyone in the World may have it, but nobody will know about it. The trouble is that nobody wants to talk about it, that needs to change. 

You’re human. I am human. We are all human. We all experience problems. We all have made mistakes. Mental Health needs to be talked about on a daily basis. Be there for someone. Look out for someone. Love someone. Offer your hand to someone. Offer your shoulder for someone to cry on. When humans are together, helping one another through difficult circumstances, we are unbeatable. Mental Health can be beaten. 

There is no shame in admitting that you’re not okay. We need to normalise talking about Mental Health. 

If you’re in need of someone to talk to, look around you. There are people out there. There are people on here. Don’t be afraid. We will listen. 

If you’re in need of sharing your experiences with others, please feel free to post on this sub. We will support you. 

**Break The Stigma**. 

Thanks guys!",06Aug2020,1
161,Growing up there was a lot of punishments. If I didn’t go to school I wasn’t allowed to hang out with a friend or do something fun. Everything was kind of “if I didn’t do____ I didn’t get to _______. Seems typical but now that I’m on my own it’s hard to get away from that mindset. I feel like I don’t deserve to be happy or feel good or do fun things if I fail at something or don’t do a certain task. Punishments don’t work for me. Never have never will.

162,"When do you realise you need help ? I'm 19 now and I've had a pretty happy life and didn't have any issues but since lockdown have started I can't sleep and all I think about is an incident which didn't bother me for years.
The Incident :- 
I was in 3rd grade and coming back home from my class since my teacher gave me a holiday . I was coming to my home and I see a woman scream . I look around and see a woman crying and vommiting blood . I was stunned for a few seconds I couldn't move and she was looking around in pain .  The aunt from the shop infront of me came to me and took me home . The woman who committed suicide was being harrassed by their family for having heart issues and they having to spent too much money on it . The time was 3:17 pm in the afternoon I witnessed a body infront of me about to die and I can't forget it . I've had two times where when I think that I could've helped her . I felt heaviness in my chest and I don't know what it was since I've never felt it before . The woman was pretty young and sweet  . She'd shout us because we used to play hide and seek near her building and shout . However I'm not sure if this is something that keeps me awake but I can't stop but feel guilty about it . Is this okay ? Is this the reason I can't sleep ? I don't know anymore.
Before lockdown I'd be busy playing games and studying but now that I have free time . I can't think but feel guilty for something I shouldn't feel guilty for. I've never shared this with anyone . I share about my life and I'm pretty vocal about it. I never really shared my mental problems and I felt that I'm weak since this is affecting me . I don't even know if it's affecting me . Do I need help ? Or this will go away ?",06Aug2020,1

Unlike my other medication which I can call the local pharmacist to get a refill and get one the next day this one I have to call my case manager from my mental health orginzation to get a refill and that can take a while. This also helps with my random impulse that sometimes cause me to randomly try and stab myself. Thought after alot of intensive therapy I have learned to control them but they still hurt my body trying to resist if you know what I mean. I'm not sure when I'll get a refill, since I am a minor and though I can contact my case manager and request for one my mom is usually the one who handles this, but due to some shit she no longer lives with us.

No one touched them” but I have this underlying fear that someone did drink from it or that it’s not clean which causes me to want a new one.

171,"So to preface I'm 26m living in East Anglia in the uk.

I don't know where to start really, Since the age of five I've had countless diagnosis through the years ranging from manic depression (apparently it's now classed as bipolar?) To borderline schizophrenia, high functioning autism, severe adhd and various personality disorders.

So at least here in East Anglia the mental health support is atrocious, I've never been treated for any of this other than some anti depressants. I've been on the mental health assessment list for over two years now, I'm mostly in control but honestly have to take steps to keep myself grounded. For fear of slipping into a delusional state which can fluctuate between funny go happy to violent, I hear and see things that aren't there rather alot but due to constantly being on edge I can usually keep it together.

I find myself split on things alot, as I am/keep myself withdrawn. Emotions confuse the hell out of me unless there's a logical undertone, I just draw a blank whereas if I have context and an analogy to help me understand I'm usually good. And can fake the appropriate response.

I live in a constant state of being on edge and just complete and utter boredom, when I find something that genuinely interests me I will memorise every little detail at a staggering rate, but for the majority of stuff I'll put in minimum effort until I just stop caring. I constantly have issues with people when I bluntly tell them ""I honestly couldn't care less""  I just mean I'll be stuck at whatever level of competency I'm at, I don't mean it negatively it's just a fact.

I don't know what expect from this post, just generally venting and hoping there's others like me about? I don't know, I'm not suicidal or anything just feel nothing the majority of the time, I don't know if that's worse or not?.",06Aug2020,1
172,"TLDR: terrible reaction to Zoloft, now I’m prescribed Prozac—is there a difference? 

Hello! 
So earlier this year I went on Zoloft and had absolutely the most awful reaction. It was constant night terrors, sleep paralysis, and when I wasn’t alseep it was migraine headaches and deep, crippling depression. At times I’d hallucinate and genuinely couldn’t tell if I was actually awake or not. It was nearly traumatizing, and I’m scared to go on another SSRI because of how badly it effected me. 

Well I’ve now been on Wellbutrin XL for a few months now and I’ve seen only problems with aggression and no actual benefit. I told my psychiatrist this and he now has put me on Prozac. I know it’s in the same family as Zoloft and I’m scared to start taking my pills even though I know I should listen to my doctor. I also just don’t trust him because he doesn’t listen to anything I say, and is hyper focused on treating things I’m not worried about.

179,"Recently I got muted by moderators on Discord for discussing Anime Censorship. I lost control of my anger. And more news about D&amp;D (Dungeons &amp; Dragons) now removed the word ""race"" because it's racist, Kindergarten Cop is ""problematic"", or any outrage videos on YT keep on piling up on the notifications.

I suffered headaches, depression, and lost sense of desire to trust. I need psychological help. I only play video games for fun, not politicizing it with gender, race, or etc. More negative news will increase my depression. Censoring a ""problematic"" issue will not solve anything. It will repeat the cycle in the future.

Websites like Resetera are destroying the D&amp;D Lore. The Outrage Culture does not end. They cancelled all my childhood memories because of all that nonsense. It's harmful to my mental health. The most heartbreaking is the Censorship of Japanese Anime Games and Removal of Fanservice in Anime Games in general issued by Sony HQ of California.

I know my topics are weird and out of place. But outrage culture can cause a double standard. The game The Last of Us Part 2 showed the Sex Scene was acceptable but Japanese Games were censored.

All gonna say this. That's how 2020 works now. COVID-19, Disasters and Outrage Culture that affects on politicizing video games, movies and the way of life. It affects my psychological perspective for who I am and degrading myself that level of negativity surrounding me is damaging me.

183,"I know.

I'm going to have to warn you that the typical formal tone purposed in my writings is discarded here. Forgive me for this; I do not feel as if there is much time left. As well as this, apologies for wasting your time.

Life isn't very good, currently. I'm not going to bother with starting an alternative account; It's not as if I'll be around to purpose it.

Any single movement is enough to induce a brief fearful moment. They do claim to love me, but they also threaten to shave my hair off, give me worthless food that I don't ask for, call me crazy, lazy, ungrateful.

They aren't incorrect regarding the last point, but it still has its effect.

Regardless of this, everything was ideal. They paid no heed to my actions, I stayed away from them, they couldn't reach me. Just me, in my little box, computer to keep me off from my volatile mind.

This amendment, well, has been adjusted.

To put it in a blunt manner; they tried to force me into a haircut, again. I'm an A.M.A.B, Agender individual (closeted, they've never said a thing about any of the LGBTQIA+ community), so I attempted to deny them, but they repeatedly ignored my direct denial of this. The entirety of the family (excluding one, but they could not care less about it.) may have banded against me.

To summarise, they've taken the computer, as well as the black-out blinds, the only shield against the sun that I possess, and are attempting to get me to adjust to the expectations of society.

*They will not halt themselves from purposing forceful means.*

I know; I'm a selfish, worthless hill of flesh, an over-sensitive, stupendously idiotic piece of privileged filth. If I wasn't so openly hostile to the status quo, perhaps I would bend.

However, I'm not that sort of person. I've submitted to the whim of the old order for far too long. I don't know what I am, what my voice sounds like, or my true name, all I know is that I will never be content with the ""We're doing it for your own good!"" excuse. I've heard it hundreds of times, they were all lying, you will be, too.

I am not the innocent victim - far from this estimate. But, I have one question; is that normal behaviour from parents, or should I be concerned?

Does it matter, also? Am I able to steer my vessel out of this storm, or will I perish within it? (apologies, have a tendency to ramble.)

186,"Hi,

I have an above average size penis. In fact, my measurements place me above the average size selected for a one night stand by women in this study : [https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133079](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133079). However, I am extremely worried that my wife will A. Hookup with another guy who seduces her B. Have orgasm after orgasm all over his penis because it is bigger than mine, shaped differently, forbidden, or a combination of all three. In my mind she says something like, ""My husband never makes me cum like that!"" Also in my mind, the other guy starts bragging to me about it and shows a video that he secretly recorded of her getting orgasm after orgasm. I do not punch him in the face like I should because I am a coward. I just submit to the verbal abuse like I always did whenever my ""friends"" would make fun of me.

Some background: I do not have a wife or even a girlfriend. I have been diagnosed with and treated for obsessive compulsive disorder which has been debilitating and has even pushed me into very dangerous situations that could have been avoided.

Has anybody else been in this type of situation where they know their wife cheated with a much bigger man and really enjoyed it even though their penis size is perfectly fine? An analogy to this is some man cheating on his wife with a really hot woman even though his wife looks perfectly fine. She causes him to orgasm so much harder and feels so much better than his wife (much tighter down there as she has not had children and is younger). The major difference is that this would hurt much more for the man being cheated on because it would destroy his confidence.",06Aug2020,1

193,Okay so this might sound stupid but I’ve never had this type to panic attack. So I dropped out of high school and never graduated. I was supposed to graduate this year and be part of the class 2020. I turned 18 recently and got a nice job as a server in a local cafe and the tips are pretty good. I eventually bought the pen foster high school diploma program for like $900 cause I really wanted to graduate. I didn’t even think of it twice all I did was see it online and whiten an hour I was signed up  and spend $900. Kinda stupid I should’ve done my research cause but it kinda shows how desperate I was to get my diploma. Once I sign up I looked through my classes and saw they are not the average high school classes it’s like math skills 1 instead of algebra 1 and it was stuff I learned in like middle school and it felt easy Idk? But I was fine cause I mean the easier the better right? And then I looked through the accreditation and licensing and it said  Penn Foster Career School is not regulated in “Texas under Chapter 132 of the Texas Education Code.” I don’t even know what that means and i live in Texas so I think it scared me and then I looked up penn foster reviews and it had so many bad reviwes of people finishing the program and their degree not to be accepted in certain collages. Idk but I started to have a panic attack I couldn’t breathe i started crying all I could think of was that I wasn’t gonna graduate and I was scared I didn’t sleep that whole night just trying to calm myself down. I look back now and I’m like why was I so scared and think it’s silly cause I emailed my local community college and they said they accepted the diploma.

They have struggled so much with everything with my brother, and it feels selfish for me to add to their stress.

I have thought about going to see my GP or something, but dont know what would happen. I assume as im 18 they wont tell my parents, and i dont want them to find out. 

I am also going off to uni in september so dont know wether to wait until ive moved away from home and found a doctor there. 

Any advice on what to do, and what would likely happen if i went to the doctors??

Thanks",06Aug2020,1
198,"I'm 20 years old, I live with my girlfriend (24) and daughter (9 mo) I'm always at home, she doesn't want me to get a full time job because we can't afford a babysitter, she works from 7 or 8 am to 4 or 5 pm and wants me to get a job where I work 5 or 6 hours a day. I'm internally conflicted, and so my anxiety and depression, both of which are medicated, have been out of control. We had a giant fight that led to me getting in her face and calling her name's and she told me to leave. I stayed at my moms for the night and came back. And haven't left since. I try to be there for my daughter and her, but me not having a job (I lost my previous on to a hug in March) had caused me to contemplate suicide a few times, but never gone through with it. And when I'm not contemplating, I'm either playing with my daughter or crying my eyes out. I don't know what to do anymore and it's gotten so bad that I feel like if something doesn't happen soon I'm gonna get too out of control, we're going to break up, and I'm going to be forced to give up my rights to my daughter.",06Aug2020,1

I take Prozac, have had experience with shrooms, LSD and really strong weed, and I'm unsure if my family has any history of psychosis or schizophrenia. I don't know if these things I hear are because of my tiredness but it may be so because again, I mostly notice these noises in the dark. I think it was last night I thought I heard knocking on my door so I opened with no one there. Went to bed, heard a Minecraft cat meow, and I know it wasn't my own cat's meow because it was EXACTLY like a Minecraft idle cat meow. I've heard the knocking multiple times before, sometimes during the day, and again, no one being at the door. Also, I think I'm depressed, I feel pretty hopeless generally and I wake up early in the morning without reason some days. Possibly unrelated but I genuinely believe in the simulation theory and I belive I've had experiences with blips of reality. I just want to know if this happens to anyone else and if I can get help differentiating between possible psychosis/hallucinations and my imagination.",06Aug2020,1

201,"I’ve started having motor and verbal tics when I was really young, it gradually got worse when I was around 9~10 until it became quite severe. I would often shout insults when a thought/something would trigger my mind or sometimes even at random, even shouting out the n word multiple times a day. I can somewhat control my tics but It’s hard to constantly supress it during class, I would try to deliver the tics into random hand gestures under the table so nobody could see me or i’d close my eyes and stretch my eye muscles into extreme lenghts to supress it in a bizarre way without having people noticing anything strange about me (It’s a bit hard to explain). I’m pretty sure you can predict at this point what kind of scenarios i’ve been through when I let my guards down or slip up my verbal/motor tics: 

- A few years back, i’ve shouted the n word in class when there were 2 african american classmates during spanish class. Although a few people understood I had tourettes and it was completely unintentional, not everyone had the same opinion about it and I completely understand why. Thankfully it wasn’t a story that was spread around the school. Shit could’ve hit the fan if that was the case.

- I screamed the n word and other insults in my house when the neighbours heard it and called my parents about it. Now they think i’m some kind of white supremacist or insane individual talking and shouting at myself. My dad tried explaining them but they didn’t buy it. They thought it was a lie so I can justify my “racism” because one of their family members had motor tics and they claim to know the difference between someone who truly has tourettes and don’t. When they don’t account the fact that it’s a spectrum and mine was severe. The old guy next door was a maniac so i’m not surprised he thinks his own argument is correct. They don’t talk to me anymore. 

- Got called mental and should be in a psych ward from many people.

- Accidentally punched my own mother &amp; sister in the face but also house furniture and walls. 

- Many instances where I swore random insults in public during school and embarrassing myself so many times.

The list goes on. 

I haven’t told my parents about these moments during my school but it severely affected my emotions and mood swings. I became insecure due to my tics and i’ve tried tourette medications which decreased my tics, however it gave me a lot of anxiety as a side effect so I abandoned that option. These memories are constantly stuck in my head like a curse. I’ve started to become isolated in my own world and refuse any social events in school/irl due to my low esteem and fear of fucking up and making me seem like an insane individual. Which 
Everytime these memories come up, I sometimes have episodes of panic attacks/shouting/punching things/minor convulsions etc... Maybe even multiple at the same time. These moments are relatively short but I just can’t get rid of the pain that always comes back to remind me. I’m only 16 and I don’t want to keep up with this disability when I have my life ahead of me. 

Maybe I am being too sensitive and other people can cooperate better in this scenario but I was originally extremely introverted in nature even before my tourettes fucked me up. I just can’t find any solutions to my problem currently and I don’t want my future to be ruined because of it. I’ve had a few methods of coping myself which were, well, let’s say it involved with “blades” although I don’t do it anymore since my sister found out a few years back. I’ve caused enough stress to my family with me constantly shouting and messing things up and I seriously don’t want to further affect them. I just want some advice as to what I should do with my future, I feel like a lost cause to society.",06Aug2020,1
203,"so lately I’ve been feeling down for no reason. at times I would just randomly cry out of nowhere when I’m not even thinking of anything. it frustrates me when I would randomly get upset throughout the day because there’s no reason why I should feel like this. It’s been like this for two weeks now and I just feel weak. I was happy for a month and doing fine but now my mind seems jumbled up it’s like I constantly have new thoughts in my mind but at the same time I feel like I’m not working to comprehend some things. Idk if that even makes sense. Idk I just feel upset randomly most of the time. I’m happy if I’m around my cousins that’s why I’ve been going over to visit them these days but right when I get in the car it’s like the feeling comes back again and I just wanna cry. I feel empty at times and just want to scream I guess. My dad wants to take me to go talk to some doctor or therapist about it but I feel like it’s not that big of a problem but it does annoy me so much to feel like this and not know the reason. I just feel like I’d be wasting their time bc I have nothing to talk about like why I feel this certain way idk I’d just feel bad. Plus I’ll just randomly feel like this every few months maybe. Like four months ago I felt like my lowest I didn’t have any motivation to do the things I love and enjoy, I wanted to be alone, I didn’t feel like eating or hungry at all, I would constantly be in bed crying, or just laying there wanting to sleep it all away but I couldn’t bc It was just hard to sleep. After two weeks of that I went back to feeling alright. I’ll have times when I’m alright but then all of a sudden I just feel bleh and miserable. it’s just I feel like my mind is stuck in a hole and I can’t do anything to help it come back out.. I just don’t know if I’m being a huge baby or if I should actually get help about it since it just doesn’t seem that bad but I feel like I’m dying inside. Idk It’s not that bad as the other times and at times I feel alright but I just feel like my mind is  just shit,,, idk if it’s even worth it to go talk to a therapist like I dont wanna waste their time you know ? And like I said I don’t know if this is me being a sensitive doo doo brain so i just don’t wanna talk to someone like that if it’s like my problems aren’t that big of a problem you know ?

I’ve seen them have make out sessions in front of me as a child and was told to keep my mouth shut. I was a quiet kid so I never said anything. I didn’t want them to fight but they did anyway and physically 

Back home it wasn’t any different my parents fought and were seeing other people behind each other’s backs. I’ve seen the messages and photos in their phones of different people. Strangers.

I noticed my cousins were picking up on it and were glorifying that shit. Cheating was being a “playa” or for women as “hoeing around”. I’ve met him heir boyfriends and girlfriends. Good people that didn’t know what was really going on.

Growing up I really didn’t bother looking for a girlfriend or being in a relationship out of fear on being cheated on or my partner being bored with me and then leaving me or cheating on me. I saw love as temporary and just a form of relief for the lonely.

Yes i have had sex with women but it was just out of testosterone field horniness from my manic bipolar episodes.nothing else. I don’t know how to be intimate or even know what affection from another person feels like. I never kissed a woman because all the ones I have met didn’t let me. I never had a girlfriend. 

I feel down about it sometimes. How would it feel to have someone love you and need you? How does sex feel like when it’s romantic? What does romance even feel like?

I'm sure this isn't making much sense. 

Honestly it's just a weird mess, I could try to explain everything, but I'm sure no one would be interested even if I could. 

Basically it's her birthday tomorrow and I don't know if I should wish her a Happy Birthday or not. I know that sounds stupid, but I'm really scared, I don't know if she wants to hear from me, I'm not even sure if she's still my friend. But I still care about her a lot, and I just don't know what to do. 

I have reality issues. I can be delusional. I just don't know how to think sometimes. And I'm really scared she hates me for making things harder. 

I'm worried if I message her, it might upset her. Or like, she might think I'm a creep or something, I don't really know. I'm just scared. I think another reason, is I'm worried she won't answer. 

Because if I send a message and she says nothing, I get really stupid and start thinking she hates me and stuff. I know that's bad, it's something I'm working on. But it really bothers me. To the point, in the past I've hurt myself, because I thought I made things harder for her. 

I don't know. I just hate being so fucking sick. So fucking unhealthy. I hate this disease, any normal person would have no problem with such a simple thing.

F 18

I don’t want this to be a long post, so I’m just going to list everything wrong with my body. I don’t know how to fix them, so if you have any solutions, please enlighten and educate me. 

So, let’s start from head to toe lol. 

1- My hair is very frizzy, damaged, and has a lot of breakage. This is mainly my fault; I fall into pretty bad, depressive episodes. (I can go months without showering, washing, or even combing my hair). This has been going on for years. I had a boy cut a few years ago- to give myself a fresh start, but I instantly fell back into the same destructive cycle.

2- I have a lot of acne all over my face. Occasionally on my ears, boobs, back, and sometimes even my private area. :(

3- I get a lot of ingrown hair on my armpits/pubes, even though I don’t even shave. And I don’t know how to avoid this problem. :(

4- My boobs are very saggy. They have been saggy ever since I got them. Which makes me very insecure and miserable. I also really hate the size of my aerolas,  they’re quite big and aren’t really a definite circle. My nipples are quite small and flat (they dont get that hard). I feel like my boobs look quite weird and unappealing. I’m also very insecure about how my private area looks, shape, and its color. :/ 

5- My inner thighs are very dark. 

6- I have stretch marks everywhere... literally everywhere. My arms, chest, boobs, stomach, lower back, ass, thighs, and calves.

I don’t know why I’m writing this, or how people will react. I’m sorry if this was disturbing/disgusting to read. I know I’m disgusting, but I’m trying to be better. But I always fail. That’s the only thing I’m good at.

That part of 2019 I was at my peak

then, during a sport competition I made a slip-up and fell at about 40km/h and hit the mat badly and got a concussion and fucked up my neck muscles. So then I had to stop school and my sport.

Gaming has a lot of potential benefits for mental health. It can help us stay connected to others. For some, it provides relaxation and relief from stress or anxiety and can even give a boost to self-esteem. But in an online environment, the factor we cannot control is other people. Far too often, gamers are subjected to trolling, discrimination, harassment, and even threats. Vulnerable gamers targeted by online trolls may struggle with self-esteem and their place in the world, and may even feel suicidal.

I'm not that strong, so I can't imagine my punches could really do damage. I've had a very mild head ache for a week now.

Yesterday I got rock bottom and started to plan how to kill myself. I've been signed off work for over a month now and I love alone. Although I've spent a lot of time with friends recently I always have to come home where I'm alone. Because of the lockdown in the UK due to the pandemic it's been 5 months since I've touched another member of my family and that's eating away at me inside. I break down in tears and scream and cry for my Mum seemingly on a daily basis these days and yesterday it all got too much, with all the intention of doing the unthinkable to myself I sat down and wrote my suicide note. Afterwards I couldn't stop thinking about how it would affect people, not just those close to me but other people who depend on my friendship to survive their own lives.
My usual coping strategies involve seeing my family and going for long walks but I haven't been able to do that this year and as unhealthy as it sounds, writing my own suicide note is by far the most cathartic thing I've done in months, maybe years.

There was a time I'd get super envious of some people, but I've figured out how to deal with those feelings. That's replaced with feeling like I'm worthless at times.
An example: I have an acquaintance in college working in a similar field that I am and he started almost a year before me. I decided to explore this area after hearing about it from him. I get anxious when I see him doing things I'm not. I feel like I'm not doing enough. And sometimes that turns into me feeling like I'm not doing the right things. ""I need to keep up"" runs through my head in a loop, followed by ""I'm a fraud and wasting my time""
As long as I can't see what others are up to, though, I'm fine. I'm self confident as long as I shield myself what everyone else is doing. I don't know how this will affect me? I don't want to be the guy that resents others' work.

251,is it normal to get ringing in your ears every few weeks? and to have had it all your life?,06Aug2020,1
252,"Currently, I (19M) am enrolled in a 5 year bachelor's program for electrical engineering (paying for 4 years, but my college has us go on an internship for 1 year). I have recently finished my first year, and am about to go for my second. I am terrified that I will be unable to perform in the workplace, and will be promptly fired due to my inability to perform, and will be stuck with my $80k worth of debt that I will have when I graduate. 

The thing is, is that I currently have a 4.0 GPA. This is due to the fact that I never went to parties, never really socialized, and focused all of my efforts on my schooling. Of course I met people through group projects and worked with them well enough (For some reason I always find myself leading the group because nobody else wants to, most of my groups turn out to be exceptional though), but I didn't maintain any lasting relationships with them. 

Also, when it came to the final project for our digital logic design class last semester, I was one of the first ones to design a working schematic for what the professor wanted. I helped a bunch of other students get started, and my design only had 1 or 2 flaws in it, which I just turned in because I couldn't be asked to fix it with my other coursework at hand (still got a perfect score though). 

This is relatively the same case with my programming class, where  I finished the final project about a week ahead of time and helped others progress through it when they were stuck (although with this project, I had a ton of help from the professor and the TAs, they basically handed me the answers). 

I finished with A's in every single one of my classes. The only class that I got an A- in was in First Year Writing, but the professor liked me enough to bump it up to an A. This is why I have a 4.0 GPA now. 

Despite all of this, however, I am terrified that I will be unable to perform well enough in the workplace to differentiate myself enough to avoid being fired. Like I said earlier I will have about $80k worth of debt when I graduate, and I am absolutely terrified that I will be unable to find work that pays enough to help me pay it off in a reasonable amount of time. I think about this every night, and even though I know it is unreasonable, I just can't help myself from fearing what could possibly happen. What if everything I've done so far has been a farce, and it was just based on dumb luck? What if it's because I suck up to the professors who then are willing to give me a better grade? I hate when this thinking happens, and I don't know why I do it, or why I feel horrible after the fact.",06Aug2020,1
253,"Reposting because I marked this wrong the first time I think. I guess the flair is supposed to be “Question”. 

I’m not seeking help. I guess in writing this I just want people to at least see some of me because I’m so tired of being reserved. Even if you still can’t fully understand me, because words alone are not enough. Although I am curious as to what kind of illness/disability/disorder I have, which is also why I’m writing this if anyone has an idea. I’m making an attempt to explain myself the best I can. I split it up into parts because it’s not just one thing. This is pretty lengthy so lazy ones be warned.

1. I think I might have what you call apathy. I don’t seem to have familial love, or any kind of love relating to personality and character at all (as well as companionship). Not from hate, but like a robot; I just don’t have it in my brain. I’ve never felt love for my family or had the drive to make friends or get into a relationship. When a family member says they love me, I feel nothing and Idk what to say. Or if someone dies—like say the death of George Floyd for instance—I don’t feel anything towards it. No hate to the cop, no remorse for Floyd, etc. I just don’t seem to care; I’m always neutral. And I have friends but Idk why I still talk to them. I don’t try to call them, hang out with them outside of school, and I don’t feel anything when they tell me something like “thanks for being my friend”. But despite that I still talk and laugh with them so Idk, maybe I have companionship to an extent, but not on an emotional level. And going back to love I still seem to have love for certain things, or at least a very strong attraction. Like the outside (https://images.app.goo.gl/yApKtKi4ed9MUrAd8) for example: I feel a great attraction for beautiful environments like that. I just feel very happy and warm. And for romance it’s the same thing: the attraction I feel for beautiful environments is the same attraction I feel for certain females I find beautiful (real girls and fictional girls (mainly anime girls)). But just their appearance; like I said, I feel nothing for personality. So it seems I love things, but not people. Or maybe I have love but not to the full extent as everyone else. Although sometimes I do feel bad for my family. Not from love but just from imagining it from their perspective, because I know how much they love me, even though I have no feelings towards them.

2. I can’t comprehend humans’ way of thinking and just how your brains function. Morals, going to school, getting a job, how you look at art, movies and shows, why you feel certain ways towards certain things, why you feel importance in certain things, why you celebrate certain things, etc. I’m just so alien because I can’t comprehend these things and I don’t feel these things myself. Like when I watch shows/movies I see people go on about character development, choreography, visuals, etc, and I just don’t comprehend. My brain doesn’t see all that, and neither does it find entertainment/satisfaction in them either. I don’t feel importance in a lot of things like school (I’ve been out of school since September of 2019), contributing to society, having to attend a wedding, etc. Although I know that part mostly has to do with philosophical conversations I used to have with my friend in where I learned most concepts are manmade, in which I lost the feeling of importance in a lot of things. But that’s not the entire reason; I didn’t feel much importance in them to begin with. And I’m not good with speech and misuse words/sentences because I can’t comprehend how you all use them. This has lead me to get into many arguments on the internet from people misunderstanding me, and me also losing those arguments because I just couldn’t comprehend what they were saying and the concepts they threw at me. As well as leading people—including my dad—to misunderstand me when I try to explain things. It’s because of this that I feel very angry and miserable because no one can understand me and the concepts that I try to give, and I can’t understand people. I’ve even been called a rapist once because of misunderstanding when I tried to explain a concept. And another time I’ve been told that I was using intentionally obtuse logic, when I don’t know what that means. I just can’t comprehend/process a lot of things. I feel like an alien amongst the human race (that’s why my name is Anomaly).

3. None of my feelings are choice. I don’t choose to be happy, I don’t choose to laugh, I don’t choose to be mad, I don’t choose to be sad, I don’t choose to be scared, I don’t choose to be disgusted, I don’t choose to like and dislike things, etc. I just am/do, naturally. Everything is just instinctual for me. It’s something my brain decides, not me. My feelings act all on their own. Every time I’d tell my dad or someone about my feelings they’d say stuff like “Don’t be so hard on yourself” or “Don’t worry about them” or just anything encouraging like that (I think that’s the right word here) to try and change my way of thinking, but they had no impact on me. And maybe this is why, because I’m not choosing to be this way, I’m not choosing to worry about what others think, etc. Words just don’t fix me or impact me like others. Do you all choose your feelings?

I didn’t begin to realize these things about myself until freshman year of high school when I really started thinking (which was last year; I’m 16 now). As well as being on social media more and more and realizing just how different I am from humans. Over the past several months I’ve began to spiral into a deep, negative and broken mental state. And half the reason for that is being around people on social media, and honestly just people in general. But I just can’t get off it because... Idek why. Idek why I’m on these places and have the desire to make posts when I’m so alien from everyone. But I also feel very lonely, and I want so bad for people to understand me and see my concepts. I don’t want to be thrown out of society like trash without anyone having ever seen my pain. I don’t want people to continue to think of me falsely (like that one person who called me rapist). I just hate being the only one that’s like this and I have yet to find another. The number one thing I desire now after all of this is to live in my fantasy world that I’ve created in my imagination, which I also write about in the Samsung Memos and IPhone Notes app. I just want to be in my world where none of you exist, and it’s just me and my imaginary significant other, and the beautiful world around us (remember I said I still have attraction for certain things, just not people; I have this strong love for beauty, like I explained earlier). A world with none of these things for me to worry about anymore. I’m hoping that when I die I get to go there—like some kind of afterlife—and finally be free and at peace. I can just live how I want with no people or anything holding me down anymore. I can be fixed and no longer mentally broken with these thoughts. I can forget all the pain and forget you all. I know it’s not an absolute certainty, but I believe the possibility is there. I know for a fact that I have a mental illness/disability/disorder of some kind, but Idk what. I haven’t had any kind of past trauma or anything like that, and my parents have treated me like any other parents. I have a good feeling that it was caused by my own birth, because when I was born I came out with a pin head like an alien due to coming out head first I think, and the doctors had to reshape my head back into its original shape. Even though they said they didn’t find any problems at the time, I’m positive they missed something and that something went undetected, and now I’m like this. Because this is clearly not normal. Plus that was all the way back in 2004; I don’t think technology was how it is now. But again, I’m not seeking help to fix or tame this. I just want to see if any have a clue as to what I could have out of curiosity. All I want now is to leave this world and be in mine. This just isn’t the right reality for me.",06Aug2020,1
254,"I'm going to hit 16 this November, however I really wanna talk about something, maybe you guys can help me [ please i'm not a teenager faking mental issues, also, may excuse my lack of vocabulary, i'm not an english speaker ].
Since 2016, well I believe, Octobers has been a nightmare for me, family problems, mental breakdowns, scholar issues, loss of interest... in 2016, I got into a huge problem with my parents, after finding out I was playing on computer instead of studying they beat me up, took away every electronic device. The following day, they had access to my messenger, and they found out I was using some inappropriate language ( cursing in Arabic ) and they beat me up again, I was shamed, they kinda lost faith in me. I lost something called privacy, because those conversations had sexual discussions ( i'm straight btw ) with friends, these normal things you do with them but fear their exposure to your parents. It was a nightmare for me, a whole month, I was 13 yo, I didn't have a phone, couldn't play my Xbox outside of summer holidays, and imagine being deprived of TV... I recovered from this nightmare many months after, but what was hurting me the most is that I've always been the good student in class, with honorable grades, looking at classmates shaming me as the nerd one, and my family neglecting my hard work.
October 2017, I don't know how ? I enter my room to find the house laptop's screen completely broken, they blamed me and I got hit again. A whole fucking month.
October 2018, school problems, my marks got down really hard. It was the firsr major lost of confidence for me, I was no longer the clever guy, I saw children who struggled in school exceeding me. I got no recognition when I was good, and now saw everyone better than me.
October 2019, I had a massive mental breakdown, I realized that I had no friends, my hunger for good marks, teachers appreciating me litterally held me back from developing myself, mentally and physically. I always saw myself as a friend of everyone, but found out nobody was my friend, I was never invited to a party, never anyone asked me to go out... I litterally discovered who really I am. At the other hand, got many problems in school and dad didn't talk to me for months, he also refused my birthday gift for him. 
I wrote this text and really wanna thank everyone who got there just to find what the problem really is. This October curse is one of many things I noticed.
Today, i'm a skinny 15 ( nearly 16 ) yo who's suffering from head hypertension, daily migraine, lack of energy due to problem in my essential minerals ( Idk if that's how we say it in english, I mean calcium.... ). I expect my sight to be lost in my 20s, I can only see colors without my glasses. In school, i'm a good student, but far from what I was. I always have faith in me, and still believe I can recover from my traumas, I really hope this year's october will be good.

I would tell him to stop but he'd just laugh and tease me and keep doing it. I raised my voice at him a couple times and then he stopped but got all pouty.

262,"Disclaimer: I may seem like one of these Tumblr girls who self diagnose for attention. I do have suspicions on the illnesses I could have, but the professional I'm going to meet in a few weeks is going to be better at diagnosing than I am.

Also TW: self-harm, suicidal thought, at least according to what I found out.

A very good friend of mine confessed she self-harmed a couple of months ago (she's clean now).
 I wanted to find out more on the subject, in order to know how to approach her in case I have any questions. I saw a science program I really like do an episode on mental health and disability, wich also tackled self-harm and I read the Wikipedia article on it. I know, that's not a ton of research, but I fealt comfortable with it. 

While reading that article, I found out that cutting off your veins in order to stop blood supply towards a certain body part and holding your deodorant so close to your skin it freezes it on purpose is considered self-harm. Honestly, some of you may say ""Well isn't that obvious?"" And looking back it think it is, but up until that point I thought self-harm was only cutting yourself and nothing else.

I was shocked to find that out, and I wanted to stop, but I couldn't. 

Next up I was looking at the Wikipedia article on self-harm again, when I saw that it usually was accompanied by another illness, usually Borderline, depression or if you're trying to stop (example) drinking Alkohol.

I knew for a fact that I wasn't addicted to Alkohol, and I knew some one who used to have depression and I wasn't like them. 

I read myself into the subject of borderline, this time more than on self-harm, and I found out I had a lot of these symptoms. Took a few online tests (I know how this sounds but I am well aware these are not a diagnose) did a comparison list with me and the symptoms from Wikipedia and other sites and came to the conclusion that I probably have borderline. 

I was still surprised, but I had an suspicion I could have Bordeline about 2 years ago (around the same Time I moved schools), so it wasn't like a big shock.

More research lead to me finding out that Bi-polar and Borderline are quite similar and that they often get confused with each other. Same pedicure as with Borderline only to find out I might as Well be Bi-polar. 

I still cared when I found that one out.

My latest realisation is that thoughts like ""I want to sleep forever."" ""So what? All that could happen is that I could die."" and ""I wish I would just stop existing."" are also not normal. Apparently this is called ""passive suicidal"" and honestly, I don't even care anymore. 
 
When I heared about that, my thought was literally ""Wooow, another thing that's wrong with me."" And that was it.

I just don't care.

I don't know guys, I think this is pretty unhealthy.

I just want to go back to simpler times where I wasn't constantly looking for approval and support and I wasn't as insecure and unhappy in my body, I didn't have to worry about grades, school, My future and career. But even then I was unhappy and still dealing with shit in silence and I'll have to do the same until I'm old enough to be taken seriously and to be trusted",06Aug2020,1
264,"I'm in the middle of getting my master's.  
I've been working fulltime since the first undergrad year.
I feel, that I'm very tired. For the past 4 month I went through a breakup, promotion (suddenly I had much more responsibilities), quarantine (which was damaging, even though I consider myself to be an introverted person). 
I'm taking part in international exchange program and waiting for my visa. Meanwhile, I'm about to quit my job to dedicate more time to my main interests - science and research.

I found myself postponing mundane tasks, things I'm obligated to do right to the deadlines, sometimes beyond. Its harmful for my life for sure. 
I have trouble falling asleep, I get 6-7 hours of sleep on week days, and 10-12 hours on weekends.

Is there a proper way to handle such conditions?
Can hobbies help? I've been planning to start doing photography for past couple of months, but I haven't started yet. 
Is it possible, that it is because of my intense work schedule and load?",06Aug2020,1
265,My anxiety has gone unchecked for long enough. It’s to the point where even the slightest thing worries me to death. It’s like my thought are bouncing around in a closed box and I want it to be over. How do I even go about getting help?,06Aug2020,1
266,"Hey reddit, please understand I’m here for help and not to be bashed. 


 I’m 18 and I have noticed a lot of toxic and often manipulative behavior that I show and have often without realizing it until it is pointed out or I have to sit and think about it often. It often gets pointed out and I get defensive and try to make other feel in the wrong for my actions. I do it without even realizing it, I react impulsively and without extra thought. 

How do I address and change these behaviors, they’re negatively affecting my relationships between me friends, family and partner. I’ve tried loads of therapy and meditation but to no avail. How do I change my toxic behaviors and actions?  Anything helps. 

If there are any questions please ask them if they give you better insight on what advice to give.",06Aug2020,1

268,"[a little rant on myself] 
Idk What's wrong with me but I think I disappointed my parents, anyone who believed that I would achieve anything hell even I am disappointed at myself. But you know what's worst I know I am not will not do anything about it. I will just play games on pc or my phone and cry alone at night because I wasted a whole year being unemployed and achieving nothing.

I even know that even if I kill myself my parents will just cry for a month and forget about me because I never did anything worth remembering for.


I downloaded around 300 courses (even those that I believe I am genuinely interested in) in a hope that I will learn something but nope my lazy ass doesn't want to do dickly dick.

I don't know wtf is wrong with me please help",06Aug2020,1

271,"My OCD has gotten really bad. I feel like I can’t do this anymore. It has so many conditions of when and how I can challenge it, and I can’t wait any longer, it’s completely debilitating. 

Can some one give me some advice?",06Aug2020,1
272,"My boyfriend and I have been together 3 years on this coming monday, and he has always had mental health problems since I've met him (I do too, but not nearly as severe as his). Last year, he obtained a drinking problem to try to drown out his emotions I think. I found out I was pregnant last year, and I think the pressure had taken it's toll on his already not perfect mental health.

Since late January when I had our daughter it seemed like it gave him a glint of hope, but of course life went on and the newness faded, and now he is in really bad shape. I don't know how to help him. I'm his only confidant and I don't think I help very much. I've gotten to a point that I try my best to be there for him, but I've become so frustrated with his drinking habit because it makes him angry and confrontational. I don't know what to say when he says that we don't need him, or that our lives would be better if he dissapeared, because as soon as I try to explain to him how much we need him and love him he just furiously tells me to shut up. It feels like a slap in the face when I've been trying so hard to help him, and I've been sticking around even with his alcoholism, and he acts as if I don't care about him. I am struggling with post partum depression and post partum rage as well, feeling completely isolated and like I'm an only parent, which unfortunately has me harboring some resentment that I don't want to do to him. I'm just not good at helping him, and he NEEDS professional help.

I think he has more than just depression and anxiety. He has had serious fits of rage, to where he becomes verbally abusive towards me and yells at me. He tells me that he has another voice in his head that isn't his, and I have caught him talking down and screaming at himself in a mirror. When I try to calm him down and bring him back to reality, he just pushes me away. However, since I've been begging him to seek professional help, he finally went today. Only for him to walk in, and for them to tell him that due to fucking Covid 19 that there isn't anyone available to help him. They just called the cops on him after he left, I'm not sure if they did so because they smelled the alcohol on him or if they were worried he would do something.

Well I got a call afterward, because a cop had found him. My bf was lucky he didn't get arrested, because when the cop pulled up he was already out of his truck so he couldn't get another DUI. When I showed up, the cop gave us a number for a therapist I've went to before. That therapist is extremely expensive, and frankly didn't help me worth shit, so that is where we are at now. To give some context, we live in a rural area, so there is not very many mental health resources to begin with. 

After this, my boyfriend went on a tangent about how he has given up hope, that he tried to seek help, and it's a sign to give up since there's no one he can talk to. My bf has been prescribed zoloft for the past 5 months, but has only taken it once or twice and I haven't been able to convince him to stay on it... I'm on it as well, and it hasn't made things perfect for me but it has definitely taken some edge off. The cop suggested going back to the doctor to see if they can prescribe him something different, but my bf is resilient because he has given up.

I just don't know what to do. I'm so scared I'm going to lose him, and that our daughter will lose her dad. I'm so frustrated and upset because of the true anguish and hell my boyfriend is going through, and I feel absolutely helpless because even when I pushed him enough to go to therapy, it's not available. I'm his only person to vent to, and the things he says and talk about have taken their toll on me when I take it on with the stress of my own post partum emotions, as well as being the default parent to my baby. It's just too much.",06Aug2020,1
