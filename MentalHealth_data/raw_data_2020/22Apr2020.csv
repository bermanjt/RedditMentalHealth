1,"I've cross posted this from psilocybin mushrooms:
If you have used psilocybin, What did you remember from your past but forgot while you were on a trip?
Weaning off depression/anxiety meds and will be taking shrooms in the next month or two.  GREATLY looking forward to it and hoping I can gain something that will allow me to never rely on pharmaceuticals ever again. We will see.
I've been pondering my past lately, and wondering what might come up during my trip. Will I relive things I have regressed? Will I find nothing? Will I finally remember and it will answer so many questions I have? 
I'm looking forward to anything that might be revealed, good or bad. Bring it on.... As long as I can heal and move on.
What kinds of things have come forward for you?",22Apr2020,2

3,"I’m 20F had mental health issues since I was 13 or so and was diagnosed with severe social anxiety disorder and depression. I was suicidal at 14. It took years of therapy and added help of an SSRI to combat the social anxiety. I actually was kind of happy/ok for a while. social anxiety lessened when I was a senior in high school and that was the best year of my life so far. it’s all gone downhill since... depression has come back, I’ve had bad mood issues, I developed bulimia, I was using alcohol to cope for a while. bulimia was under control for a while through therapy. but since fall I’ve been severely depressed every single day. before then I was ok sometimes, but now I can hardly remember the last time I was actually happy. then covid happened and I came back from school to live with my parents. my dad is a narcissist and has really horrible anger issues and undiagnosed mental illness issues and he basically blew up at me for having an eating disorder. I have been somehow even more depressed since I’ve been in quarantine, and now I have this added stress of my relationship with my dad being basically ruined. none of my meds seem to be working and my bulimia is worse than ever. I am so fucking exhausted. I can’t keep living like this. I don’t have any motivation or hope for my future. I don’t see myself being able to stay alive much longer. I have never liked myself or been happy with the way I look, which can be unbearable. I have friends and family that I love and they’re the only thing keeping me around but it is almost too hard to bare.

4,"**Introduction**

Suffering and pain are almost inevitable experiences that we will all face at some point in our lives. Whether it is psychological, emotional, physical, or even spiritual, it is unfortunately very likely that we will endure some amount of hardship in one way or another. Having said that, there is a great difference between suffering needlessly, like an eternal victim of the negative circumstances of the world, and becoming a triumphant hero who is able to overcome their struggles, by allowing their discomfort to motivate them to become even stronger and wiser.

In religious terms, some consider suffering to be a punishment from God for not living in accordance with his will, whilst others believe the Devil to be the true cause of the suffering of humanity. Atheists take a more rational approach and believe it to simply be an unfortunate element of existence itself. Regardless of whether these beliefs are true or not, suffering is here to stay for the time being, and so we should become more prepared to deal with it by developing resilience, and learning skills to cope more effectively.

Causes of suffering range from the mistreatment from others, physical ailments, mental health disorders, trauma, tragedy, spiritual crises, general fears, extreme guilt, shame and self-hate.

People respond to suffering in a variety of ways, some of which have led to some of the worst crimes in history, and others have allowed people to transcend their suffering and become greater versions of themselves. Other methods include denial, distractions, medication, and various other ways of trying to numb the pain. The following three tips will hopefully give a more mature and healthy way of effectively reducing suffering experienced in our lives.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tip 1: Self-compassion**

When you suffer, you should practice having compassion for yourself, which should help mitigate much of the pain that comes with it. If you are being hard on yourself, or you believe that you don’t deserve compassion and forgiveness, then a good tip is to imagine you are caring for a close friend, family member, or other loved one.

Instead of saying:

**1)** “I’m a helpless victim”

**2)** “I deserves this”

**3)** “Why did this happen to me”

**4)** “I’m worthless”

Say:

**1)** “I choose to be a survivor”

**2)** “No one deserves to suffer”

**3)** “Nothing is personal”

**4)** “I am worthy, even though I am imperfect and make mistakes”

This method is particularly useful is you are ‘beating yourself up’ for mistakes and sins that you have made in the past. You should be aware of immoral things that you have done, and aim to change them, but endlessly tormenting yourself isn’t helpful and will only make things worse.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tip 2: Meaning**

It was theorised by the psychiatrist Viktor Frankl, who lived through the Holocaust, that one of the best solutions to suffering in life is by searching for meaning in it. He developed Logotherapy, which is a therapy based on existential analysis, and focusses on Kierkegaard’s *will* *to* *meaning*. One of the key principles is that striving to find meaning in our lives, is the most powerful, motivating and driving force in humans.

The three basic principles of logotherapy are as follows:

1. Life has meaning under all circumstances, even the most miserable ones.
2. Our main motivation for living is our will to find meaning in life.
3. We have freedom to find meaning in what we do, and what we experience, or at least in the stance we take when faced with a situation of unchangeable suffering.

So whatever problems we are facing in our lives, whether we are being haunted by memories of the past, or anticipating fears of the future, we should try to discover and derive some meaning out of it if possible. Sometimes the answer we are looking for may be obvious, whereas other times the meaning or purpose may seem elusive, so we will have to try harder to find it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tip 3: Defence mechanisms**

Two people may experience the same problem, the same frustration, the same pain and suffering, yet decide to deal with it in two completely different ways. The brain uses defence mechanisms to deal with unacceptable, or potentially harmful, stimuli and impulses. Many of these are classed as immature or even self destructive, whereas some are far more healthy and productive. The following are three recommended mature defence mechanisms that you should learn to use, and incorporate into your life; as opposed to the immature, destructive, and self-defeating ones.

**1) Altruism** \- One of the best and most productive ways to feel better about yourself and to distract yourself from pain is to focus on helping others instead. Ideas: help to feed or clothe the homeless, join an animal rights group, volunteer in a charity shop of soup kitchen, choose a vocation which is concerned with helping people, donate money to a worthwhile cause. Read this article for ideas on random acts of kindness: [https://daringtolivefully.com/random-acts-of-kindness-ideas](https://daringtolivefully.com/random-acts-of-kindness-ideas)

**2) Sublimation** \- Sublimation means to transform unacceptable impulses into more socially acceptable ones, which are more productive and less harmful. Examples include: take up running, cycling, play a sport, try martial arts, exercise, workout, creative expression such as music, writing or painting.

**3) Gratitude** \- Perhaps the problem isn’t that we are suffering too much; perhaps the problem is that we are not practicing gratitude enough to counterbalance the bad things in life. As often as you can make a mental or physical note of things that you feel grateful for. These could be positive memories from long ago, recent achievements and accomplishments, or any personal development you have noticed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Quotes**

&gt;“When another person makes you suffer, it is because he suffers deeply within himself, and his suffering is spilling over. He does not need punishment; he needs help. That's the message he is sending.” \~ Thich Nhat Hanh  
&gt;  
&gt;“How do you overcome the suffering of life? Be a better person.” \~ Jordan Peterson  
&gt;  
&gt;“I assess the power of a will by how much resistance, pain, torture it endures and knows how to turn to its advantage.” \~ Friedrich Nietzsche  
&gt;  
&gt;“He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.” \~ Friedrich Nietzsche  
&gt;  
&gt;“In some ways suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.” \~ Victor Frankl  
&gt;  
&gt;“If there is meaning in life at all, then there must be meaning in suffering.” \~ Victor Frankl

I’ve noticed that when i’m watching a video and eating a snack i’ll eat it without realizing because i’m distracted. But with bigger meals I feel I can’t swallow without water. Not sure if it’s mental, physical or both. My friends have recommended hypnotherapy.",22Apr2020,1

7,"So I have went through a lot in the beginnig of the year. I contacted child services because of my physically and emotionally abusive father and I cut him out of my life. It was really hard due to people not believing me or defending my fathers behaviour. I was in a lot of stress and my adhd got way worse. I couldnt stop fidgeting and having these moments were i didnt feel like my body could stop moving. I started hitting and slapping myself. My bestfriend who knew what I was going through stopped talking to me. I knew she couldnt handle all my problems (wich I never expected because shes my friend and not my therapist) and even though I always tried to not talk to much about what I was going through because I knew it was really hard on her, she just started distancing herself from me. For weeks she didnt even look at me. I then forced her to talk to me and she said she cant handle my ""outbursts"" (where i fidget and hit myself) and that its all just very hard on her. I apologized for burdening her and said that id be more thoughtful of her. It still took a few weeks for our friendship to be normal again and I was affraid to mention anything to her. I was trying to surpress my adhd and stop having my moments even though it was really hard for me and I always just tried to leave the room we were in. It's been a few weeks of quarantine now and I am currently rethinking the whole situation. I kind of think she's a really shitty friend. I know that the whole hitting and slapping myself could've been to much for her but instead of telling me she just ignored me for weeks. She basically told me that my problems burden her to much and kept nagging me about therapy and expected me to process everything in a couple of sessions. I felt ashamed of my adhd and hated myself for something I couldn't really control. Am I overreacting? Was it normal for her to have reacted the way she did? Am I expecting to much?

8,"idk where to post this so im sorry if this is stupid. but i dont understand my emotions and what im allowed to really feel. Ever since i can remember anytime i felt upset or sad my parents would invalidate my feelings and now that im 19 and i live with my divorced mother, things are still the same. I cant express how i feel without getting told im selfish i am. Its not fair and it makes me feel like i dont have a voice. Now since its just her and I, she sometimes treats me unfairly but not all the time. She tells me to take care of my younger siblings ,when my father or her could, or she gets weird about when im out or what i chose to do. She could be worse but ive learned to live with it. Only until now It affects my relationship and i dont want my s/o to be affected by this but since i cant leave to live by myself (esp w this corona situation) its just bringing more stress on me. Where its like i have to kiss ass or disregard how i feel to bring together both sides of my life. My s/o cant stand my mom and vice versa. my s/o always tells me how i should set boundaries and i have absolutely no idea how to bc of knowing my moms not going to listen or change. Ive done some research on emotional incest and it doesnt feel like it but idek i could be so used to it. I just want to feel okay and it just feels like im drowning in constant arguments. I dont want to totally cut off my mom but thats the only advice ive seen. Idk thanks for reading, any advice would be appreciated",22Apr2020,1
9,"Bored and lonely

My boyfriend and I are holding down during this pandemic and I’m handling it fine but the beau isn’t and talking about it just seems to frustrate him more. He says he’s bored and lonely. He’s shoots down every suggestion I make towards finding a hobby/stuff to do and now he’s just frustrated. To make things worse, we just got a puppy and are both handling it differently. He’s very antisocial and a homebody, somewhat of a boring individual (some may see it like that but I still love him, almost 6 years strong!). Our puppy was raised more with women so respects me more then him and he’s not willing to be more interactive with her because he’s frustrated about the whole situation. At this point I’ve stopped talking to him about it and letting him stew in silence. He usually gets like this around the holidays/ his birthday because he doesn’t have any friends (this is mostly this is true).  I’ve asked him in the past to seek out therapy and talk to someone but he’s very unwilling. When it’s nice out we do yard work ( I more then him but whatever). He has a workshop for woodwork but rarely builds anything unless I ask him and because he’s in the dumps, he’s not even motivated to build anything I ask for just to give him something to do. I’ve suggested watching a TV show together from the start but says nothing appeals to him. Aside from just leaving him alone, what else can I do? We live together and own a house. We are both working full time from home. I’m worried about his mental well-being but I don’t want to overreact or overstep my boundaries. (X-posted, looking for insight 😞)",22Apr2020,1
10,"I am way too calm about everything in the moment, because things take months or even years to dawn on me how serious they are.

In December, I had to tell someone I'd known for 3 years that we could no longer be friends. I still think I made the right decision, but until now I was indifferent about it. A normal person would have had a heavy heart all along, because that’s not a pleasant decision for anyone to make.

It just now struck me that “wait a second, that was really sad. We had been friends for three years, and I had to cut him out of my life.”

That’s just one example of many.

The same thing goes for when people close to me have died. I usually don’t have much of a reaction until weeks or months later. Thankfully, this hasn’t happened in a while though.

There might be an underlying mental condition of some sort for this.

People have praised me for always remaining calm in fiery situations. The reality is that I just don’t feel these situations to be serious in the moment.

I want to have a complete reaction to things when they happen. Of course your opinions can change over time, but I am tired of not noticing how serious something is until long after it has already happened.

In effect, I sometimes have to endure problematic situations, because I don't notice how comfortable I am. Here's a silly example. As a kid, my dad used to pack me a lunch, but I would never eat it. I could never understand why I wasn't eating it, until it dawned on me one day that the ethnic food he was giving me would have been embarrassing for me to eat in front of other kids. Since I didn't understand that, I had no way to attack the root cause of the problem. We could have tried to work out a solution of packing a lunch I would be more comfortable with, or helping me muster the confidence to stop being embarrassed about something so trivial. But that was delayed for a while because of this problem. I could list so many examples like that.

Do you have any advice?",22Apr2020,1

15,"Yesterday I finally got up the guts to tell her that I have a suicide plan, know it is wrong, and need help.  I guess she really didn’t know how to handle it because the whole session she just went back over how we can control our actions/feelings. 

While that is true, I feel like I will be out of control soon and get too deep into things and attempt. I can’t go to the hospital because my parents wouldn’t understand (my life is “perfect” right now and they would think it was for attention) I’ve attempted suicide before and can say for a fact I wasn’t in my right mind when I did it so I couldn’t control it.

So why do I really want to die. I am a high risk individual for COVID and I'm still going to work thinking maybe I'll get sick. My coworker told me she has to have a biopsy on 2 lumps found in her breast and that she could have cancer and all i felt was jealousy. I drive every day thinking maybe I'll get into a terrible car accident today and when i arrive safely i just feel annoyed. I really really really want to die already. And i have no idea why.

Now I get episodes of tachycardia (though I think that’s related to my anxiety), but I still get lightheaded and stumble when I get up, even after eating.

29,"Hi everyone, it says here one can vent out to others, so I am venting out, sorry if this is too long. 

I am an ocd/anxiety/depression patient, I suffer from a plethora of issues, but I think they are all because of my ocd and anxiety, I am actually afraid to discuss my health situation and would rather ignore it all together to avoid a hypochondriac spike, my issues I think I finally got to the root of it, I have had constant sensation of doom since I was 17 (I am now 32), but it really blow up in my face when my father died suddenly when I was 27, I never thought I had real issues and he used to belittle any and all issues anyway, and I used to just believe him. 

I think I suffered for so long from emotional abuse in my childhood, so I am trying to figure out if this explanation of mine to my problem makes any sense, my basic issue (sensation of doom) maybe stems from my lack of any occupation of my time, I do nothing at all, I feel paralyzed most of the time, I have way too much time on my hands and a series of books to finish writing which I never get to. 

 So sensation of doom because I don't occupy myself with anything, but I think I don't occupy my time with anything because I have lost all faith in myself, my self esteem is very low and I have constant crippling self doubt.

This low self esteem and self doubt may come from my heightened expectations of myself, somehow I think my delusions of grandeur and having a super harsh inner critic have caused my inferiority complex, I think I should be superman while knowing deep inside I am nothing at all, this caused me self hatred, I have deep rooted guilt for many reasons, but mainly because I could never really satisfy my father, nothing I ever did pleased him, and now I am trying to convince myself I am a mere mediocre man with mediocre talents and mediocre goals and nothing is wrong with that. 

 I am also super afraid of any confrontation of any kind, even if I get blindly robbed I feel so frightened to agitate my tormentors, sometimes I feel any confrontation would lead to a violent outcome which makes me so scared and feel if I am not violent enough in turn I would definitely be killed, I feel to avoid that I have to get rid of any threat and it makes me agitated and scared because I can never really defend myself.

Can someone please tell me how to cure myself of my self doubt and being scared all the time? I swear to God ""Fight or Flight"" is my constant state of being and has been for the last five years.

btw, in wikipedia it says that it works for depression and shit like that so i will say a few things here in case it helps the post:

I suffered bullying 2 years

I had emetophobia since 6 years to 13, at 13 i went to the mental health hospital bc i was 23 kg with 13 years so i almost died and in the mental health hospital i suffered a lot bc doctors treat us like shit and it was apart from the normal hospital so no 1 knows the things that they do

I think i had depression bc i used to take another pill wich i dont remeber the name but i felt soooo sad, and no, i dont mean depression like teenagers think depression is that they think its cool to say that

well, thats all bye",22Apr2020,1
32,"I have this online friend who seems to have issues. He looked up locations of my friends and me and lied about his gender for 3 years, which is definitely creepy. According to my peers, he's best to let go and I shouldn't trust him, I agree. We've been friends for 4 years, so it's really hard to let go. I gave him a long paragraph explaining why we shouldn't be friends anymore, in the most polite way I could. He was genuinely hurt by the end of our friendship, he said he was quitting discord forever.

This is where the OCD part comes in. I keep telling myself, It's best to not be his friend anymore. But still, an obsessive-compulsive thought pop into my head every 10-15 minutes of the day - saying ""oh, what If he comes back and I can explain what I thought? Would he forgive me and we would be fine eventually? Would it never be the same? What if the reason he's staying in my head is that fate wants us to be friends?""

If you question a friendship in such ways, it's most likely an unhealthy friendship, but my OCD won't stop me from thinking about it. I tell myself to listen to my friends because they're all right, but my brain isn't.

Please help me cope with my OCD, I can't take this much longer if I'm being honest.",22Apr2020,1
33,"i feel dumb for feeling this way. okay background: i come from a pretty well off suburban family. but that being said their money is not mine and they make that very clear. and whatever my parents do pay for, they use it as blackmail. like oh you have average grades? you take advantage of us. also since i was young they have told me i was fat. i remember when i was like 8 and my parents took the rest of the food off of my plate and put it on my brothers. i have so many memories of these specific instances. my parents have told me my weight does not align with family values and that i am going to die from my weight. i am 130 and 5’8, and a 20 year old girl. they have also told me i am a ruiner and ruin thing for our family. 
anyway, so here’s the main thing. my grades are not the best, but not the worst. I had a 3.3/3.4 throughout all of high school. Freshman year of college i got a 3.2 first semester, but REALLY struggled second semester and got a 2.4. this was the worst GPA i have ever had in my entire life. but that being said, i got my grades back up fall soph year and had another 3.2. so this semester i was doing great until this coronavirus madness hit. the week before school was called off one of my aunts died. then my other aunt was put into the hospital for 2 weeks for seizures, came out of the hospital and immediately had to go back for attempting something bad. and on top of this there is a damn pandemic!!  but my parents don’t give a fuck. they think i don’t try and just take advantage of them. i have a younger brother and he can really get away with whatever the hell he wants. he has been suspended from school (i have never ever been in trouble w school, lol my social anxiety could never) but it’s frustrating because there seems like such a double standard. he has severe behavioral problems and they do absolutely nothing about it. i just do not understand how they can hold me on such a pedestal to be this perfect outgoing straight a student who is skinny and never has any problems, when they let him get away with anything. i’ve brought this up to them many times but they say they don’t know what to do because he threatens things about his mental health.
i have struggled with really bad anxiety and depression really my entire life. i used to self harm, and the first time i ever did was freshman year after my parents yelled at me for my weight. it went on for a year and my parents never noticed, which was fine i didn’t want anybody to know. it just helped to alleviate all of my pent up sadness. but one day i was driving and my mom saw and immediately just asked me if i was doing it for attention. my anxiety it’s just absolutely insane, like i wake up at 7 am and just throw up for hours (not morning sickness haha). i tried to talk to my mom about it but she told me it was a consequence of my bad grades. 
i just feel like i will never be able to please them. and i feel pretty damn worthless and like a failure. my grades are average, but i’m involved in many things at college like a sorority and student government. i also run a youtube channel where i make money and work with brands, so i have other things going for me besides my grades. but it feels like i don’t. 
just after years of being told i am a failure i really just do feel like one. it’s so hard because i care so much about what my parents think about me. i’ve been micromanaged my entire life so it’s hard to separate my feelings from theirs. and their thoughts about me are turning into how i see myself. 
today i literally wrote out a suicide note. i have never done this before. i care too much about my brother and my extended family and friends to do it. but my parents just will never take me seriously, and it just felt like a way to finally get them to realize how much of a toll this has taken on me. i know this is just a lot but i really just need to talk about all of this. 
it just feels like no matter how hard i try they don’t hear what i say. today i tried to tell them how much of an impact their insane amount of pressure puts on me, but they just laughed at me and told me to take out a student loan. i guess i should. but that scares me too because it’s just detaching myself from my parents. their love just seems so conditional and i don’t know how to distance myself. and it’s hard because i don’t really want to. the good times with them are SO GOOD and the bad times are just so damn bad. 
but no matter how much they dislike me, i just wish they knew i disliked myself 10x more. i refuse to look in the mirror because i am absolutely repulsed at my body. and i look at pictures of me in highschool and it just makes me want to bawl because i was so tiny and i thought i was a whale. i still do think i am a whale but i was actually super skinny then. i’ve always had to hide food and stuff, or pay for food in cash because my parents will yell at me. i feel dumb complaining about this because from the outside it seems like i come from a perfect family. i just wish people could see the years of emotional and psychological torment that have left me feeling like a shell of a person.
there is just so much going on right now and i wish they would just cut me a break like they do my brother. they always listen to his mental health issues and help him so much, but discredit mine. it makes no sense to me. and it’s just absolutely ruined my self worth. 
if you read this whole thing thank you and i just really need some advice about what to do. i can’t tell if i am being overly dramatic or if i actually am in the right. i have honestly no idea. they have completely warped my self image. 
this is a lot but thanks reddit just needed to word vomit lmk what y’all think
also i am a generally happy and outgoing person on the outside so its hard to talk to my friends about this because nobody really knows what happens behind the scenes

ok thanks",22Apr2020,1

Even if i feel physically full, if there is food in front of me or in my vicinity i have to eat. I feel like im normal until i go to other peoples home or even when im around my boyfriend... i feel like nobody else eats as much as i do. After “binging” i feel disgusted and have even thrown up a few times (not every time) or just cut myself eating but then i get depressed about it and do it all over again.

But I feel like more realistically, it slowly got worse 2 years ago when I first started school. It was about this time that I loss my appetite (i can barely get myself to rememberto eat 1 meal a day), i stopped sleeping normally, and noticed myself becoming a bit more ... emotionally fragile?  But I always managed to pull atleast semi-decent grades (B's and A's) so I didn't think anything of it. 

Now that I've been doing school online, I feel like what I've been feeling for the past few years has gotten so much worse. Even before this isolation my grades started slipping but now I'm concerned I may actually fail a few of my classes. It's exam week, and I'm trying so hard to stay motivated but I can't.

38," No one knows this about me but I have low self esteem, I just don’t show it. I am self conscious about what others think of me, even though I know I shouldn’t be. I experience episodes of social anxiety on/off. I have been experiencing recurring bad memories from people who were my friends who I haven’t been friends with for years; like 5+ years. The memories are from like 10 years ago, when I was in high school. I feel like these memories are keeping me from being the real me because I’m still worried about what these people think about me even though we’re not friends or have talked in years. I feel like I was bullied by these people but not how we think of regular bullies because these people were my friends, yet they were just cruel people overall with a lot of insecurities. I have been battling with these bad memories for years now... I’ve gone to group therapy which helped for a little while. I have taken medicine which drastically helped my generalized anxiety. I’ve basically beat panic attacks, generalized anxiety and even the social anxiety I experience is very much under control... yet these thoughts are really the only thing that’s left and I don’t know what to do. I’ve been to psychiatrists and psychologists and they always say that I have been able to overcome a lot of the anxiety that I feel and that I have a high IQ, yet these thoughts of feeling so little are still fucking there. I remember a period in my life where I thought my low self esteem was cured because I was so sure of myself and had confidence that just radiated... that was between the ages of 18-21. After those years, my self esteem started declining again and these bad memories are persistent. I’m currently 26, and clear about mostly everything expect these bad memories. I don’t know what to do. Has anyone else ever managed to get past painful memories? How do you get to the point of not caring what others think about you at all?

43,"It's my partner [40yo] but this isn't about our relationship. I already know what I'm doing about that. And I'm keeping boundaries. At this point I'm very concerned about them and they need help. [USA]

**Here's the background:**

This person has shame and control issues where they try to prevent whatever outcome is scary for them. Controlling information, outcomes....it sometimes leads to lying, secrecy, and disrespect and even addressing any issue, they get triggered that they're being ""accused of being a terrible person."" That exact phrase. This leads to spiraling absurd circular arguments. Facts change, timelines change. Anything to defend themself against being a ""terrible person."" They used to disappear and drink for weeks until this past year. Their efforts to control everything basically just backfire. 

When I first met them, one night they got really upset about a lot of chaos in their life and I found them drunk in a closet after spiraling downward for a couple weeks.

I left them a year later during one of the disappearing/binging incidents when I discovered they'd propositioned people they knew to meet them in hotel rooms next time they traveled. They travel a lot for work but the other people didn't seem to have heard from them in a long time if ever in this way. They went to rehab, stopped drinking, started therapy and made a lot of changes. 

We eventually tried again and it was better but a year later, when they spiraled again and came home drunk, I discovered they'd lied about the several incidents where they drank. Then they really stopped drinking and got more serious with therapy and things were awesome and normal. Conflicts were normal.

Now almost exactly a year later again, things went bad in their life and now that they're not drinking or disappearing, the circular arguments are back but as day long rages. Around this time, they lied to me about going to a strip club because they didn't consider it really being there because they were just socializing on the patio. They apologized but still don't think saying they weren't there was a lie. They hate strip clubs and are critical of those who go.

They've been working more intensely with the therapist about the control issues and I decided couples therapy as kind of my last straw as I move forward in my own life.

**What's going on right now:**

The control stuff is a major theme of our couples therapy and the strip club thing came up as an example of how trust is an issue when they control information. I'd also discovered they were mutually following an escort on insta. I presented them with both as simple facts and they spiraled into cognitive dissonance. Absolutely sure that I'm accusing them of being a ""terrible person"" who goes to strip clubs and talks to escorts but also aware that I'm not making any accusation and these are facts. They've flipped out completely despondent saying that I'm ""evil"" and I'm making ""evil accusations."" I suggested that maybe their actions didn't match with how they felt about themself and they said that was true. I suggested they reach out to their therapist.

They know they're not okay and as someone who cares about them, I'm really worried. Everyone else has kind of disappeared. Is there anything I can do for them to finally get the help they need? Have you experienced this yourself?",22Apr2020,1
44,"I'M JUST SCARED.

I'm just scared, I've lived in America since I was 7 years old, had a baby at 16 (typical Latina stereotype and I blame my parents just a little bit for it but thats another story) I went under the daca legalization, had it for almost 4 years 18-21. I tried re-newing it last year but in the course of that I got an assault charge, which I found guilty for because of a bad lawyer (also I might have some issues with just owning up to my mistakes, but again, another post) it was domestic abuse, I self defended myself I called the police and I was the one who ended up with all the charges, I was too scared to press charges and so I never did, this happened September 2018. anyway, this is the reason I'm not being denied DACA. I talked to one lawyer who told me I needed to wait two years to get that off my record and then re-apply for DACA then. does anyone have any other advice on what I should do with this time so I don't go crazy?

Almost twice a week he will get mad for something out of my control (miscommunication, me not being able to explain things for him to understand it), or for a mistake I made. If I don't behave the way he wants me to do he will start an argument that will lead into him screaming me usually to shut up and to leave from whenever we are (only me). He says things that hurt my feelings and usually mocks me in the arguments. He also comes back a couple more of times when the argument has ended to remember me what I did wrong.

It's usually always my fault, at this point I can't seem to care anymore. It just hurts me. I'm not a conflictive person, I don't like to fight and I usually tend to avoid it. I am more of a person that will start to cry when I'm angry or frustrated. So whenever I end up a discussion, like today, I end up with suicidal thoughts. I know those thoughts are lead by my state of mind but I can't get myself to stop feeling sad.

My father is not a monster, he doesn't hit me and when he's happy he's nice to me, but I have to be careful to see if he's mad so I can avoid him (he is always saying I deserve to be screamed because I'm the one who made him angry or that if he doesn't scream to me I will never learn) .

When I'm around people, I become extroverted. If the topic is something I can contribute to, then you bet I'll make sure people hear what I want to say.

Going with the crowd is natural for me, but taking the first step is the problem.

I have really good friends I can talk heart to heart with, also a very close friend from school that I just like being around because we love each either so much. Everyone normally texts me, and make plans to hangout here and there, but it causes a lot of of stress for me.

I go months (and even years) without talking and texting these people, and when they suddenly call to hangout, I get so much stress and get anxious before going out. Obviously, things will always be fun and loving as the way a proper hangout should be, and I always end up going with the flow. But the initial stress is getting so bad that any tiny inconvenience added to that will make me burst. It also takes me so much pain to facetime my blood sister (I cherish her) who's living in another country.

I use Whatsapp only for work, so even seeing the other texts on the face of it makes me uncomfortable, so I try my best to avoid seeing them. 

I have a history of depression. Now, it's only anxiety attacks. My case of social isolation is getting worse. I'm not able to text any of my college friends and to see them IRL after this quarantine is much more stressful. The only contact I have is with one friend and we send memes to each other without a lot proper conversations, so that doesn't stress me out as much as it should.

I know I should see a therapist, but I come from a family that doesn't believe in my anxiety. They took me to therapists for depression. I had fought for what I wanted to study in college. Now they ask ""you are happy right? What do you mean you still don't feel good?"" And they ignore my problems all together.

In 2013, **6,233 suicides** were recorded in the UK for people aged 15 and older. Of these, **78%** were male and **22%** were female.

I decided to write about this topic after watching multiple videos on youtube to do with sexism over the years however the straw that broke the camels back the comments of a youtube video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyjojnnhMoI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyjojnnhMoI)

To explain my view on this video is that it is raising awareness to help stop the breast ironing of women however the comments just make my skin crawl!

"" Men traumatized women so badly that women traumatized their daughters to keep them from experiencing the same trauma. Lovely world we live in. ""

"" Sick. Raise your boys right, so they don't turn into men who like 13 yo girls. ""

"" Why not educate your illiterate men instead of doing horrible things to women !????? I really don't understand these ppl ""

And the list goes on. If men are attracted to young girls then that makes them pedophiles and they should be locked up! However **the trauma caused to these girls is also by the mum's who are doing more harm than good but people always love to link the argument back to men and blame men!**

When men are constantly blamed for everything, **what message does this send to young boys** when they feel like they're constantly being blamed and humiliated?

**Here's an eye opener**, these days there are about 100 sexually submissive males for every 1 dominant woman, these submissive men will normally get turned on from being treated like **less of a man, degraded for having a small penis**, **sexually attacked and damaged**, and the list goes on! But it didn't used to be this way, however when young boys are constantly blamed and humiliated in the media for their sexuality and this is a possible **coping mechanism** they could develop which are most common in the western world!

More men kill themselves every year than women however more women are diagnosed with mental health illnesses and I believe this to be because men feel 'silenced' by society having to appear 'more manly' and 'not weak' because this isn't attractive, women want strong tall men.

It's becoming a big problem. Men suffer a lot too.

I’m three weeks behind on work and every time I get to the point of opening up the assignments and starting it I’ll get three sentences in and get side tracked doing god only knows what. I’ve tried the apps that lock out my phone for x amount of time thinking it was just me getting distracted by reddit or Facebook or something- and I just end up off doing something else. I’ve tried setting up parental controls on my own damn computer to keep me on track and again, I still end up distracted by something else. 

And no one can agree on a diagnosis or treatment plan. 
When I was a kid they tried to diagnose me as having ADHD, MDD, one tried to give me a bipolar diagnosis (at 11), GAD, etc. 

Now as an adult I have one doctor trying to diagnose me as Bipolar Disorder Type 2, one an adult ADHD diagnosis, and one is just going with depression/anxiety.

I currently only see the one who is convinced I have just anxiety/depression- my insurance constantly switching is why I’m seeing different doctors. I’ve been keeping track of my moods/sleep/anxiety daily and we’ve managed to rule out Bipolar- as my moods cycle far too rapidly for it. I’ve tried Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Lexapro, Prozac, Buspar, Paxil, carbamazapine, and a few herbals along with talk therapy and behavioral therapy.  Currently Wellbutrin keeps me from wanting to die- but beyond that it has done jack-all for my other symptoms and I’m struggling but no one has agreed and my current doc won’t prescribe anything except Wellbutrin and/or one of the SSRIs/SNRIs. Even though every SSRI/SNRI I have taken has given me side-effects I can’t handle. Lexapro made me not sleep for days on end, Paxil made me grind my teeth so bad I broke a couple molars, Prozac made me suicidal, Buspar made me so nauseous and dizzy I had to take it with Zofran and sleep for at least two hours after I took it so I was napping all day long, Zoloft turned me into a zombie who didn’t give a shit if I lived or died- which when combined with me being impulsive meant I did some stupid shit and should probably be dead. 

I’m just so stressed out because no one seems to know, care, or even have any guesses as to how to help me function and it’s driving my depression even worse.  I’m pretty sure I have ADHD- considering I’ve been diagnosed as a kid (but never got treated because mom didn’t believe in it), was diagnosed as an adult at one point (but the doctor didn’t want to prescribe anything because of how abused the meds are), and I don’t even know how to bring it up as a potential diagnosis because of how many people have tried to fake adult ADHD diagnosis just to get the stimulants.

I just need to rant and there’s literally no where and no one else I can without being told “other people have problems too, at least you’re not suicidal anymore.”",22Apr2020,1

61,"I’ve come to notice that as of pretty recently I have had a pattern of breakdowns following any sort of change in my life, even if it is seemingly insignificant.  For example after winter break I returned back to school from my home and had about a week or two of a feeling of dread and general sadness, as though I couldn’t adjust to going back to school.

Another example is when I moved into a new apartment. I didn’t necessarily have a great attachment to my old place but couldn’t shake the feeling that I was missing something and that there were aspects of my life in the old place that I could not recreate in the new.
Additionally over spring break I returned home again and had this same feeling for a long while. Due to circumstances I have to return back to my apartment tomorrow where I go to school which is a 6-7 hour drive away and I can already feel myself starting to spiral into this weird place I keep finding myself in.

63,"-Not sure if this is needed, but trigger warning-

I’m 15(Nonbinary born female) and for the past few months I’ve felt like my mental health has been worsening and quarantine is making it a lot worse.

For some bg info, around two years ago (I was 13 at the time) my family and I had to live in a hotel for a few months due to multiple issues, including financial issues, we had. Because of this my mom had to work a lot meaning her ex, who’s bio related to me and my siblings, had to watch after us. My mom didn’t know at the time but her ex was abusive towards my siblings and I, physically hurting my (at the time 10yo) brother to make him behave, yelling at my (3yo at the time) sister for making messes including calling her retarded (she’s autistic), and having me watch my siblings so he could go do something else like smoke a cigarette in the lobby or sleep and he’d yell at me if something went wrong. He also tried threatening my mom saying he’d get us taken away if she didn’t give him money after they separated. While I think I got the least of it, I still cut ties with him after him and my mom separated because of how he treated my siblings and I as well as my mom. (Their relationship was toxic from both ends.)

Fast forward a few months after that to the summer of 2018 and I was in one of the worst places I’ve ever been mentally. I felt incredibly lonely since I didn’t talk to anyone other than my family in the hotel room, felt like I had no friends, and arguments with my mom and my future stepdad happened often. Because of that mixed with what happened with my moms ex, I felt terrible. It got to the point where I’d research ways to off myself.

The tipping point was a giant argument with my mom and future stepdad in which I had a breakdown and tried to off myself but couldn’t get the cap of a pill bottle open. By the time I did, future stepdad had knocked on the bathroom door and I ended up not going through with it.

I was able to forget about the incident for a bit over a year until late 2019 and haven’t been able to forget about it since. Quarantine hasn’t been well either and has been effecting me negatively as well. It’s gotten to the point where around two weeks ago I gave into urges and started cutting. A friend of mine has been a HUGE help with helping me try to not self harm and has given me advice and helped me through some urges, but it’s still difficult not to do it. I also don’t want to bother him about it either since I feel bad when I do despite him saying I’m not bothering him. 

I’m worried that I’ll fall into the same place I did in 2018 and end up going through with what I tried to do. I don’t want to do that. 

I don’t want to tell my mom or stepdad about what’s happening either because I don’t want either of them to feel at fault and I’m worried my mom would twist it to make it seem like I’m blaming her, she’s done it before with other things. There’s also been times where I’ve had panic or anxiety attacks that she’s made fun of me or not taken me seriously during them because I was “just being overdramatic”. 

I’m not sure what to do.

70,"Hello! This is my first post to reddit and I am currently under a very weird predicament.

For as long as I can honestly remember I have always had a ridiculously strong urge to break my own fingers, blind myself, amputate my leg (or both) and I’m not sure as to why.

Now I don’t have all these urges at once, they usually just appear and at times it’s for certain body parts.

Keep in mind I had a pretty good childhood (no trauma ) and when it comes to my body and self confidence I can say I am alright where I’m at. ( I can always improve on my weight in the future! )

So, as far as these urges go I have never acted upon them, however I have gotten incredibly close. What terrifies me is I don’t really get as to why my body is actually having these strong urges. 

I refer to “my body” as my body, but it really feels like it isn’t sometimes, it feels like it acts on its own with out my mental input which has always been difficult to manage.

If anybody has any idea what this could be I would gladly appreciate any insight into it!

I was young and more innocent and I got messed up by something that I wasn’t even apart of (and it happened multiple times over the time span of a year). It happened around the age 9-10, I’m 13 now and it still hurts me to this day. 

I started becoming scared every night, I was scared to go home everyday from school, and never wanted to go to bed. I cried myself to sleep scared everyday, wanting to sleep but I couldn’t. I started imagining people in my room and in my house. The night the first time it happened I was so scared I left the house secretly and sat outside crying for 10 minutes at age 9. My parents to this day still don’t know what happened. They think I went out there to meet someone for some reason. I told them I sleep walked (a lie). Once I “recovered” in a way, I came out of it really aware of a lot of things and became distant from many people. 

That same year I was also getting bullied at school, which was frightening because I wasn’t used to that kind of treatment. All my elementary school years I went to nice schools where everyone was friends, but then in 5th grade we moved and I ended up in the worst place possible. I became stressed and overwhelming sad, and went from being the nice friend to the cold one who “broke” every once in a while. I became really observant of others and started teasing others about every little thing without fixing myself. 6th grade was great. In middle school I started over. I was semi-popular, people knew me but I didn’t know them. Although, I was simply the girl everyone knew, but I had no friends whatsoever. 

7th grade was the worst I’ve been so far. 5th grade was the worst experience, but I think my mental state truly collapsed in 7th grade. I couldn’t do any work, I would hits sir and stare at the walls. I started vaping (which I got caught doing) and self harming. I started having terrible hygiene and looked really rough. I began to start feeling crazy and disconnections from reality. I had terrible “friends” and even started personally bullying some girl I just didn’t like. I started skipping classes also. I finally told my parents a small bit of my struggle and told them that I was stressed and started skipping some classes. 

They took my to therapy. I got a shitty therapist and went for THREE sessions and got diagnosed with ADD and anxiety. U also got diagnosed with dermatophagia (skin picking and eating disorder, starting in 2nd grade I started to peel and eat the skin off my fingers. I still deal with it but it has gotten better) but I denied a lot of questions because I didn’t want my parents to find out. They took me out of therapy and pretended like nothing happened. I had to work myself out my problems on my own.

I am now in the 8th grade, have been getting all a’s and is not happy exactly. I’ve been pretty numb to emotions this whole year, just a constant state of nothingness. I haven’t self harmed much, only because I never really actually did anything because I chicken out every time it hurts and I feel shitty after looking at them and trying to hide them. 

One thing I also began to struggle with a lot this year (yep, it gets worse every year) is talking to myself, imagining, and pretending I’m others. That’s normal, but I’ve come to the point that I even wake up thinking I’m this person, thinking “What will I do today that would look cooler if this person did?” Ive become so un fond of myself that when I do something good, like win a volleyball tournament, or beat a game, I imagine I’m someone else, because surely, they’ll be more appreciated if they did it. They would seem cooler with this title. 

I’m obviously getting better on terms of restricting myself from bad emotions, but I seem to just get something new every other year it seems like. It’s crazy how one (or more) instances can change your whole life. I don’t think I’ll ever be the same because of something so dumb. It was just that unfortunately I was a innocent kid who saw the wrong things at the wrong times, and now I can hardly live correctly.

I don’t know how to conclude shit like this but I guess this is my story.

Hello. So since this quarantine, I've been home and away from work. Usually I'm fine with taking time of work, as my work puts a strain on my body. But after a few months of being locked inside, I feel weird.

Almost every morning I wake up with a nauseated feeling. As if I'm dizzy, sweating hard (despite not feeling hot) about ready to throw up. Not just that, but during the day, whether I be playing video games or just watching TV or something, I'll randomly get a pain running across my back and shoulders. Even though the quarantine is happening, I still maintain a regular exercise schedule and am in good physical shape, and when I do exercise, I experience none of the stated symptoms. Which leads me to think it's a mental thing.

When I spoke to my GP over the phone, he said it could be a form of claustrophobia due to spending so much time inside. When I ask him whatever else it could be, he simply says that that's what it is and there's really no other reason to feel like this unless it's some sort of disease or something - which he said is highly unlikely given that I had a physical done weeks prior to the quarantine.

the nights when this happens are the scariest ones, they're the nights when im most likely to do something ill regret and cannot undo. most of the time it results in tears, an overload of emotion or none at all, and sometimes self inflicted wounds.

Another thing is that anxiety hits very hard in online courses when the docent asks me a question or I‘m getting put in a smaller work group. Again I can‘t think straight, I‘m very confused and tense all the time. I can‘t speak up except for agreeing because I can‘t think of anything to say. I can‘t participate or work on the tasks.

I've had high standards, especially when it comes to academics. Every failure feels like the end of the world. It didn't help my parents basically forced me to focus hardcore with schoolwork. I'm still trying to accept failure as a part of life but ever since quarantine it made everything so much harder to function properly. I feel like a ticking timebomb, about to have another goddamn breakdown.  

There is so much stupidity in my logic when it comes to dealing with my mental issues - I isolate whenever I get hurt (that hurts my boyfriend the most), can be hypocritical at times (like when I say I don't like people who talk to me in an aggressive tone but I do that myself without a second thought), can be hurtful when feeling threatened (by that, I mean I feel threatened even if someone looks at me while I'm doing something, which is so stupid it's unfathomable), ignore advice on how to get my shit together (this is why it's so hard for me to improve, it's like I don't feel I want to be helped. I want to be left alone).

Honestly, I should isolate myself from everyone else just so I don't hurt them any further. Yet that thought by itself is the dumbest thing to be thinking about. It's so hard for me to be honest to myself. I keep sending mixed messages to myself. I usually lie how I actually feel because I'm afraid to hurt others about how I feel. I have pretty hurtful thoughts to others that will just make everything worse.

Sometimes my friends annoy me so much I don't want to talk to them and isolate. I feel this every single day. My actions say I don't need help and that I can do everything by myself but I'm screaming on the inside that I need someone, I want to feel loved. Yet the feeling of being loved doesn't stay there long.

I've used to be in a toxic relationship before but I'm not in it anymore for a few months. I'm sort of grateful that my current boyfriend is so caring and sweet, but I feel like I'm the toxic partner here because of my unhealthy behavior I inherited from my childhood experiences that I thought to be ok to have. I used to have pretty violent thoughts to physically hurt others and that scares me that it nearly drove me to suicide.

My mind is in a really bad place and I'm isolating myself from social interactions with my friends again.",22Apr2020,1
86,"I had servere depression for about a year, during that time I barely ate anything except sweet things and dinner. I'm no longer having constant suicidal thoughts, but I still eat practically nothing. I don't eat any breakfast except on rare occasions, for lunch I eat crackers with dip or cheese and for dinner I have a normal sized meal. If I eat breakfast or extra lunch I'm then unable to eat as much of another meal (mostly dinner). This is causing me constant fatigue although I'm able to do my job fine, I have heavy eyes all's day and I sleep for 12+ hours on my days off. Even though I'm not eating much Im still not under weight or anything. It also takes me a few hours to fall asleep, I find that asmr helps me a lot with that though. 
Any suggestions that could help me eat more would be much appreciated.

90,"I think it may be due to a toxic friendship I was in a few years ago. This person would continuously hurt me and degrade me and play the victim whenever I would try to stick up for myself. I would be the one apologising even though I know I did nothing wrong.
I no longer talk to this person and ive been surrounding myself with people that I get along with so well, but I've noticed one of them to be particularly judgemental and prideful. She says things that hurt me and again, if I try to defend myself, she gets more defensive and tries to validate herself further.

A few months ago, she did something that caused a big breakup in our friendship group. Everyone got annoyed by her because she was always calling them names and mocking them. The things she'd say we're absolutely horrible and I really don't blame my friends from distancing themselves from her. She got mad at I ended up apologising to her because I'm an absolute moron.

I think at one point, she realised what she did and she's tried to get along with me again. But the connection we have now is very weak and forced because to this day, I'm still hurt by what she did. I think it may be due to the fact that she never apologised for what she did, rather just tried to ease herself back into my life.  Now whenever she texts me and I see the notification, I get really annoyed and agitated and I think 'i really don't want to be talking to you at all'

This is gonna be a weird one, so strap in

All my life I've been decently intelligent, and lucky enough that my family is both loving and well-off. 
So I've been innundated with talk about how smart I am all my life - yadda yadda

Recently, I've felt myself going a little crazy and not just because of quarantine

I've started to hate my support structures that I'm lucky enough to have, and I feel like I'm getting torn in two different directions 

I want to talk to people, but I hate keeping up conversations over the internet; I want to scream my lungs out and do something, anything, risky and dangerous, to do something spontaneous, but always never go through with it 

I want to cry, and I can't do it 
I want to yell and I can't 
I can't even have a panic attack, because my brain just refuses to stop making so much damn sense 

It's gotten to the point I've stopped caring about most things and just started rationalizing them - including the behavior of myself and others, death, society, anything. 

I have so many ambitions I want to accomplish, learn guitar, finish learning my parents first language, get better grades, etc but I have no motivation or anything 

I consistently do everything at the last minute (I wrote an entire 2400 essay in 2 hours before midnight) then turn it in and get a B- and call it done 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I know I'm insanely lucky, and I don't have much to complain about - my family loves me, there's nothing they wouldn't accept, and they keep me on the straight and narrow 

I'm terrified that I'll graduate my good college in a good program, get middle management and be well *this* for the rest of my life 

It's gotten to the point that I actively think I WANT to hit rock bottom, even though logically I should never want to, and i never could 
And somehow that scares me 

But I hate this and I don't know what to do

Thanks anyone for any help",22Apr2020,1

109,"Being stuck in the house was fine. I typically enjoy staying in and keeping to myself. But then I lost my job, so I can’t even leave for work. I recently was told I can’t come back when quarantine is lifted due to financial struggles in the company and since I was entry level they didn’t need me as much as the others. That’s fine, IT jobs are a dime a dozen. I can even work manufacturing if I have to I’m not picky. My bills are paid and I had a decent financial safety cushion. 

Then the accident happened. I was turning left and had my new to me car totaled due to someone speeding through the red light going 60mph. That’s okay, a month later my injuries are all but healed and my driving anxiety/being in the car anxiety has started to ebb away. I’ve yet to get a new car since dealerships aren’t selling and I don’t want to buy one online. There’s also the issue with me being unemployed and not having the greatest credit due to a small credit card debt I had accumulated over the last year. I was finally in a position to pay it off in terms of financial security but now I’ve got to worry about a new car and a new job so minimum payments it is. 

Then, on Easter, my pappy passed away. He was 80 and fought a long and hard battle with numerous illnesses. I faced my current fear of the outdoors and corona and booked a flight back home to be with my family. I wasn’t even allowed to see my grandmother who was morning more than my mother who was in the room when he passed. My aunt and uncle wouldn’t let me near her in fear she would catch the virus. I understand but when a 79 year old woman with dementia is crying because she wants comfort from one of the few people she remembers and you have to stay away it’s hard. 

On top of all of this, my anxiety won’t even allow me to go for a walk without getting afraid of the illness. If I want to even go out front of my house I have to be stoned out of my mind. I had to take a ton of edibles and be sure I was on a direct flight each way last week to make it. I can’t use marijuana now since I’m taking a break as I’ll be job hunting and despite my medical card I can still be discriminated against as a user of marijuana.

I haven’t been able to leave bed for more than eating or using the bathroom. I can’t remember my last shower.

110,"I want to know WHY people are so willing to let others decide what and what is not mentally and emotionally healthy in their relationships? Why should anyone have the power to decide whether someone else's relationships are healthy and what other people should want their relationship to be?  Obviously, people are individuals and what works for one person or makes one person feel happy and fulfilled is the ""right way"" while others are wrong.  

I am not sure if I am wording what I am trying to say clearly but Im trying lol. Think about this...so there are 2 couples.  Couple #1 has what is widely considered to be a stable and healthy relationship. They both have good jobs, lots of their own friends and a social life seperate from their partner and they both have seperate hobbies and interests they pursue on their own.  They spend about half of their free time together and the rest doing their own thing.  Couple #2 is different. One of them works full time, the other chooses to stay home or work part time and takes on the majority of the housework and meals etc. They spend very little time without the other outside of working hours.  They have the same social circle, enjoy pursuing the same hobbies and interests together and even run all the errands together because they enjoy eachothers company so much. 

Keeping in mind the most popular way of thinking today, the first couple would be considered healthy and the second couple would probably be considered codependent and to have an unhealthy level of attachment.  If both couples are happy, why is the first model so much more widely encouraged and accepted and the second frowned on? 

Not everyone wants the same things out of life.  I would be miserable and lonely if my relationship was like Couple #1.  I know others would feel crowded and smothered in relationship #2.  There is no one size fits all and there never will be. So why are relationships like the first considered well rounded and healthy while those like the second are considered examples of what NOT to do in a healthy partnership.

114,"Content warning: pain, self harm and suicide

So, for starts I have to say that I'm not in a emotional crysis right now, so please don't worry about me but I am gonna talk about some weird and sad stuff.

I'm writing mainly because I'm wondering if anybody elses feels the way I do, since I couldn't find many sources online.
The thing is, I think I'm somehow addicted or allured by the concept of suffering. Let me explain.
I'm a very imaginative person, and I daydream a lot. Since i'm slightly insomniac, most of my daydreaming happens in bed, and it takes me up to an hour or two to fall asleep. The issue is that my daydreaming, which is mainly driven by escapism, is mostly about me suffering. 
And that is pleasant to me.
 I take great peasure in narratives about being tortured, about loved ones dying (and it's not because I hope the do, i really love them) or even fictional loved ones. As a matter of fact, if I'm feeling down or I'm having a sad night, its precisely those thoughts that I summon to escape. They are appealing to me and I don't know why.
I just finished watching a couple of series that deal with sad and depressing themes (in particular, In The Flesh and Please Like Me) and I found myself wandering about why I like them. I came to the conclusion that I put myself into the main charachter shoes (usually a small framed gay man, like myself) and i draw pleasure in them going through s*icide attempts, self h*rm, death, betrayal and that sort of stuff. Its a weird sensation, because half of me desires in some kind of way to be them and the other half desires to take kare of them, soothe their wounds, hug them. I can't really wrap my head around it, but I want to make clear that, to me, this is enjoyable, I don't actually FEEL sad when i picture myself as them, i feel, in some sense, happiness.
This is also reflected in some activities that some people described as ""digital self harm"": i'm an lgbt activist and I suffered a lot through my teen years to achieve self acceptance, but I purposefully pursue on a daily basis homophobic websites. And I watch them. Sometimes it""s just anger fuel, but I think I do that also because I want to feel like somebody hates me. Maybe it's a want to relive childhood, in a sense (I wasn't born in a very friendly area). 
I wanted to ask if somebody goes through what I do. And if you would reccomend therapy. In this moment, as I sad, this ""thing"" is not an issue for me, but a source of pleasure, but I'm worrued it might be revealing for underlying issue. Afterall, one does not heal easyly from self hate.",22Apr2020,2

But lately I’ve been having (non) convos with my family, like I will actually think we are having a convo. Then I open my eyes or look and no ones there

Idk if it’s me dreaming or not. It’s scaring me tbh, sometimes I ask my siblings something about the convo and they’re like “what??”

117,"My  partner has told me how they felt everyday and I really want to help,  in any way. I don't know what it is exactly, so to look up information  on it, I don't know what to look for. I know I am not in any position to  make a diagnostic, but I am only looking for a way to get a little more  information. So I am asking in this subreddit if anyone can identify  with what he has told me and tell me something that you would like  someone you love to do, or stop doing. (excuse my english by the way)

Here  goes. He gets angry very easily, but always, always makes an effort to  control agressivity. He is constantly thinking that he HAS to be the  best in everything, better than everyone, and gets really irritated when  someone who did the same as he did it better. He knows this, hides it,  but can't control the feeling. This is present in every aspect of life:  sex, work, and in conversations, he always turns it to himself, even  when the other person sometimes has something important to say. He also  rarely really listens to anybody. He know all this and hates it. It came  to a point when I, while not yet knowing this, got a bit mad for some  things and told him. A day after, he told me that after the  conversation, he cried like he hadn't in years and was so angry at  himself to the point of some mild (""mild"" depending on your experience)  self-harm. ""I was almost about to spend the whole night kicking a tree  outside."", he told me.

And this  worries me, and I don't know how to get better information on the  subject, because when I look up anxiety, it's not exactly what I find on  websites. He is a nervous person, he is insecure and NEEDS to be the  best, he NEEDS to stand out, and he gets angry easily because of the  minor competitivity or annoyance. (I should note that we never had a  fight, and on the very rare times he shouts he is immediately sorry).  And when I look up 'anger', I feel it's also a bit off.

I don't know if this is relevant or not, but with me being a relatively calm person, when he gets irritated or angry I always switch to a really calm and slow voice and try to understand what he's feeling (doesn't mean I always succeed ahah).

I  should note as well that he suffered from anxiety as a kid because of  bullying and when things get very very bad, he still has panick attacks,  but hasn't had in around a year.

I  really really want to help, and being in isolation isn't the best. So  if anyone has some advice out there, it'd really be appreciated :)",22Apr2020,2
118,"To begin, I’m new to this sub. I thought this would be a good place to talk about this because what I’m about to discuss is pertinent to mental health.

I’m a freshman at the University of New Haven. I’ve been going through a rough time mentally and only recently, through the support of my best friend and mother, did I decide to seek help in the form of an on-campus therapist. Those services have remained in service through the closure of the campus, however, the school President decided to furlough half of the counseling centers staff until the fall. While this isn’t a huge deal for me, because I could get by without the services, it is a huge deal for my best friend and many like her who suffer from deeper mental health issues and need our counseling services, now more than ever.

She started a petition on change.org to show President Kaplan that his decision to furlough the staff for budgetary reasons is very unpopular and detrimental to the student body. I figure that many of the folks here would understand our struggle, and we’d really appreciate your support. I got the link here if you’d like to sign on. Thank you!

120,"(I actually made a reddit account for this post, because i feel like reddit is full of actual people and not polaroid magazine snakes)

Hi all, i'm a college student studying electrical engineering at my local university. I tell you this because it ties into my problem: one of my colleagues, let's call him Joe.

Meet Joe:

Joe and me attend the same classes together with about 20 other students (yes, it's not your usual big university). Joe is in his mid-twenties, 2 to 3 years older than me and before attended a non-tech focused school, just like me. For some reason however, everything he says about subjects sounds like as if he had years of experience. He did work as electrical engineer before, but not the academic kind, more like the wire boy (not to put these jobs down, i'm a wire boy myself now). At the start of our time at uni he seemed over-average, but this has taken on forms over the last few months that i cannot explain.

Joe scores As on every exam we take and in his sparetime he does said wire jobs. After a day of getting new learning material or homework, he is already done with it and shares his calculations with the rest of the students. Whenever a professor asks anything, he is always, ALWAYS spot on and chews through theory-heavy books so dry you could soak up the oceans, like grandmas cake. One time we did a pseudo-exam over a few days to test our abilities. On the same day he told us that he had calculated it and sent us the solutions. It takes me about 4 days to do the same. Wait for the best story: a few days ago some student asked how we were doing with our theory of finance and companies -homework (yes we learn a bit of that). After some mixed responses, he sent a photo of a cmd screen with a bunch of errors like ""booking unsuccessful"" and sarcastically said ""i'm doing fine!"". Another student asked, why he was writing into the cmd terminal and he replied with:

&amp;#x200B;

""oh i just made a quick program in C that does most of the accounting for me""

&amp;#x200B;

What a legend. Even my colleagues called him a nerd this time. You might think that he is a nerd. That's where logic stops. He is not a nerd. He is fit, friendly, humble, interesting, voluntarily serves in the military and isn't too boring to be with at the pub. He has a girlfriend, a future brighter than 100 Amps through a wire and will graduate with 100% certainty. This man doesn't have any weaknesses and i envy him. So so much that it's actually impacting my focus.

Instead of studying, i sit in my chair hating myself for not being like him, trying to find out his secret. Like a good protagonist, you need flaws to be relateable. He isn't. He is quite easily the super student. And every time i talk to him he is just so friendly and helpful that he lulls me into praising him like a legend. And at home i cringe at that fact. He is so perfect in every sense of what a student can be. He brings 200% to the table, and that's a low point. I want to understand how somebody can be like that. Whenever i'm proud of a project, i see his and realize how much of a stinkpiece mine is and i can't feel good about it. He is passively robbing me of all my dopamine and inner respect for myself and i can't take it anymore. I want to improve, either i lose my grudge against him or step up to his level. But i can't. I study from 8 to 8. My day would need 40 hours to catch up to him. I desperately want to improve, but everytime i take a huge step it gets shrunken down near infinity compared to his progress. Collegues can be better than me. I have no problem with that. I know that i'm the slower kind. But flawless? I can't accept that. I need to know. This keeps me up at night. Sorry Joe, you suck the life force right out of me.

It's not his problem, i know. I'm just bitter. I want to change, but feel like i can't, i can't catch up.

Can somebody tell me how to better myself?",22Apr2020,1

124,"Since my country is having lockdown and quarantine, and I am unable to book an appointment with my current counselor. I guess I vent it off through this post. Please correct me if my post doesn't belong or breaks any rule in this subreddit. Also, as I am not a native English speaker, so forgive my grammar mistake.  


I like to talk some of my background before I go into my current situation. So I am coming from Asian Family. While my story isn't as extreme as story in AsianParentStories subreddit, but it does affect my current mental health. As the eldest son in my family, I was "" taught"" to be have the responsibilities to ensure everyone close to me is ""perfectly"" fine. Got grounded couple of times because something bad happened to my brother or them. And this become a basis of who am I currently, I always have a habit to reach out and ensure people I care about does not have any issue (usually my family and couple of my close friend), do my very best to cover other responsibilities if they are unable to finish.   


During my school lives, one of my teacher started to worry about my weird behavior and decide to have a talk with my parents as she think I shouldn't be overloaded with this kind of responsibility. She gives her perspectives as a parent, and trying to correct my parent parenting on me. It quickly leads to a big quarrel, where my parents tell the teacher to mind her own business.   


So, during one of my university internship where I had to work remotely (at my rental house for couple of days), my younger brother  suddenly ask me to do house chores. When I told him I would do it after my work as I am busy at the moment, he suddenly snapped at me, and expect me to do it now as it has always been my usual responsibilities. This is where it started my fear. Then, that's where  I started to experiment on rejecting other people request on purpose. I just found out that no one gives a fuck on me, basically people only call me when they need me but wouldn't helped me when I need their help. The worse part is everyone including my parents are expecting my help or else they think I am out of my character. During these period, I starting to get worse by each days and I started losing some of my friend.   


During my last year, I  started to exhibit some of the signs that I need help from counselor. I started to be very trigger-happy, would suddenly show my anger towards other out of nowhere if they claimed I am responsible for thing I shouldn't have in the first place. For example, there is one time where a volunteer comes up to me and wants my donation on the poor and needs. When I am about to take out my wallet and makes a donation, he suddenly said as someone (me) that are fortune enough, I have the responsibility to give back the community. I couldn't control myself and I immediately put back my wallet and tell the volunteer to fuck off. I proceed to have a panic attack for 2 hour. I know I what I am doing is not normal and very rude to the volunteer, but the tone of the volunteer just remind of me being used by other and I couldn't help myself. This is the time where I started to meet my counselor where I am still going today.  


Recently because of the quarantine, I am still working at my home remotely for about a month. Today, I had a retrospective meeting on the last week project with my head of department where he gives disappointment on me based on my performance today. One of my new (very recent) colleague (senior) accuse me of not being very helpful for the past few weeks as I overlook his message on requesting my help on certain things. But what they didn't know is that I worked my ass a lot because my new teammates are unfamiliar to the project and unable to do most of the assignment from the client, as a result I have to work overtime for a week and a half, sacrificing my sleep just to allow the project to finish on the due date. After the meeting, I starting to afraid being bullied like the last ex-colleague (a senior) I had where she shoved most of her works on me.   


This is today trigger I had followed by housemate (unintentionally) jokes on me for not doing my job in protecting him on some online games and some facebook and reddit post where I saw some doctor-shame, rich-shame on the current pandemic issue. These are what fuels my fear this evening. For the last three hours, I uninstall my facebook app of my phone and several subreddit where their usual post that trigger my fear. Then followed by having a mild panic attack. Currently it is on midnight on here, but I still trouble to have my sleep because of it.   


I am very tired of my weakness as it is really troublesome.I know some of the action triggered by other sometimes are not intended, but I couldn't help myself at that moment, where I goes anger and paranoid at everyone intention.

128,"I’m someone who has dealt with depression and other mental health issues for years and in recent months it’s improved dramatically due to good friends, good job, good girlfriend etc

Right before this lockdown I had been going for a promotion at work for months and I was meant to hear back about it in February but due to some understandable and reasonable circumstances it kept being pushed back and when I asked about it one of my managers revealed that because of the Coronavirus and how badly it impacted our business they couldn’t do my promotion at the time and it would be postponed til after it all clears up (I understand and there’s nothing they can do), literally 2 or 3 days later the business closes and we’re all on paid leave, a few days after that the lockdown starts, I was with my girlfriend a few hours before it was announced because we wanted to spent time together one more time

During the lockdown I’ve keep myself calm and has my mental health has still been okay, I make music so I decided to record a new album and spent a week making instrumentals, so I recorded one song two weeks ago but I record using headsets and the mic started giving problems, I’ve gone through two more headsets since then and finally decided to buy an actual singing microphone which arrives on Saturday, but over the past 2 weeks trying and failing repeatedly to record song TWO out of EIGHTEEN has started to piss me off because the album could be done and released by now if not for poorly designed headsets (in the past I’ve always used headset mics and had no issues, the ones I’m using now keep turning out to be garbage and messing up my vocals)

After all this it’s started to make me feel demotivated and kind of cranky, I’ve been doing drawings/ paintings and cooking alot but I cba to do anymore art work and I’m starting to put on weight from all the cooking, the music stuff is like the one thing I’m motivated to do and I can’t do any of it

Honestly I was fine until this week, now I feel demotivated for about anything and just want to be left alone, I haven’t seen my girlfriend or friends for a month now and I still message my gf everyday and my friends and I keep in touch but rn I just don’t even want to message anyone, I just want to switch off all social media and forms of contact and not talk to anyone

The Corona issue has messed up everything - it cost me a promotion I was going for for 6 months, I haven’t been able to see anyone, my family are starting to drive me a bit crazy since we’re together 24/7 and earlier today we were all shouting at eachother over stupid things, I can’t go to the gym to stay fit and healthy either (I lift weights and if you stop for even a week or two you lose quite a bit of muscle mass and strength)

129,"She and I have known each other for about two years now and from the beginning, she has always been pretty high strung. However, as the years have moved on, I started to realize that she has some serious problems...and sometimes they put me on edge. 

She is a sex addict but more of the concern is that she likes to manipulate the men she sleeps with. She gets pretty sensitive to and lashes out at men and then blocks them. yet, she doesn't have many girl friends. Recently she told me that she hates her ex's family so much that she was so happy to see them suffer when their dad recently passed away. She also told me that she sometimes envisions strangling her ex when sleeping together. 

I can tell that she manipulates me too sometimes-- we'll be on the phone for an hour and a half where the entire time it is her talking about her. When i tell her i have to go, she usually disregards it and then i finally say i  NEED to hang up. It's exhausting. She told me that she obsesses over my looks and she has body issues (even though she is very fit and good looking).  Sometimes she'll call fake crying and 2 seconds later be talking completely normal. She is also very honest with me and my problems and says she always looks out for me?

133,"So I suffer from dpdr (24/7), depression, suicide (not as much anymore) and anxiety for most of my life. Im only 17 so not that bad i guess. But the way anxiety is affecting me is by stomach pain and nausea. The stomach pain is pretty constant, same as the nausea, but when i leave my house to go out with friends, or any other stressful situations, the stomach pain can restrict my movements like getting up and moving around. And the dpdr is getting worse in the way that it is making it very hard to talk to people, do school because it is affecting the way i think. For example, i might forget full conversations, whole days, and i have huge gaps in my memory and knowledge. I am drunk, which for some reason makes my brain work better. I was suicidal, more when i didn't understand what dpdr was, and i thought i was trapped in purgatory, and i have attempted a couple times because i couldn't deal with the fact that i believed nothing was real and all the visual affects that come with dpdr. So i am seeing a psych from my local hospital, but its only in the early stages where they are trying to find out what's wrong with me.

I would like to say, this post is not to slam my friends. They don't tell me I'm annoying to make me feel bad about myself, but more like because they want me to change.

I don't really fault them for it... Although it hurts my feelings, I'd rather have them tell me about what bothers them than have them silently hate me for it.

I just dunno how to change though... It's starting to make me really depressed. I'm losing a lot of motivation to do anything, but the less I do the worse I feel. Despite being home all day, I'm neglecting so much, and it makes me feel like such a failure.

Some of what I want to change about myself feels like I just can't. Like it's just who I am. Like the thing that annoys people about me most... I'm one of those people where when I feel super passionate about something, I just can't shut up. I've tried to shorten my, from  what I've been told, ""'uninteresting"" stories, but when I get comfortable around people it just happens. And I never realize I'm doing it until my story is over.

Sometimes I contemplate if I should even be around other people. I feel like maybe their lives would be better if I just shut myself off. And maybe my life would, in a way, be better too. They wouldn't have to be annoyed and bothered by me, and I wouldn't have to worry about being a burden to them. Of course it's not ideal. That's not what I want. I would be lonely, but I've tried convincing myself that eventually I would get used to it.

I feel like it's only a matter of time before they all leave me anyways. And sometimes the part of myself that really hates me thinks maybe they should. I don't think being lonely would be as bad as knowing my friends are frustrated being around me. I think I would rather be alone if it meant they could be truly happy.

I just want them to be happy, even if that means I won't get to share it with them.

* Be uplifting
* Slap me across the face in word form

It would be on me at all times so that I wouldn't have to truly focus on whatever I was doing or thinking. It continued all throughout high school and had a serious negative impact on my grades. 

I simply wasted my life. I tried so incredibly hard to quit it, but I kept failing. I hated myself for other reasons as well, and long story short I battled with an eating disorder and depression. This past year I have gotten a lot better. I have made new friends, felt more comfortable in my body, and had less harmful emotions in general. However, I was still hopelessly addicted. 

The last six days, something clicked and I have not been wasting the hours away like I usually do. It was easy for the first two days. I read, played guitar, was productive. I finally felt like I was capable of living my life to its full potential and being mentally present.

151,"Hey

Long story short.. 
My mom and dad had a rough relationship, they eventually split back in october last year, after I had a physical fight with my dad. Since then, he has moved out and hasn't spoken to me. Not even an happy birthday text or happy new year etc... Nothing.. 
I am also to stuborn to text him first. I don't think it's my place to do.
He still speaks to my brother tho, but he took the first step.
I have a really good connection with my mom and he keeps hurtíng her via lawyers, trying to get her money and all that. And it keeps me up at night, not knowing how things will turn out.

My question is,

Should I reach out to my dad and ask him to Bury the hatchet between us and try to get along together or not? I really don't know what to do.

Thanks in advance

153,"Following the lockdown, my internship and meetings with my supervisors could no longer take place, so this gives me all the time in the world to finish my assignments. In fact, I literally have no excuse to not be working now.

But I just can't bring myself to it. I have very little motivation. I've always been a procrastinator. And I think labeling myself as a procrastinator and specilating that it's chronic and caused by whatever mental issue I might have (adhd?) only reinforces it - victim mentality style.

This time it's just ten time worse, especially that there's no one to hold me accountable - come to think of it, I've always relied on extrinsic motivation. I'm sure I would've made more progress if I was still in *work mode*. But this quarantine dragged me to a sedentary life that I got used to so much that I forgot how to get out of it.

155,"**tl;dr: I have been obsessing over my ex-boyfriend's ex-girlfriend for over 11 years, I can't stop thinking about her and I even created a fake fb account to message her recently. See more info in the text below. It sounds stupid but I just realized how sick this behaviour is, I'm looking for any book/website/other resource recommendations that could help me try to learn about this behavior and move on from it, since I don't have enough money for a proper therapist right now.**

I'm a 34 y/o F. Throwaway account because this is the first time I have ever told another person about this, I'm nervous but ready. 11 years ago I dated a guy (we dated for 5 years in all), it was an unhealthy relationship so I eventually left him. But at the beginning of our relationship he told me he had dated a girl in a city close to where we live, and I snooped his facebook page to take a look at her. This was back when almost no one had good privacy settings on Facebook, so I was able to see all of her pictures, status updates, etc. She was beautiful, seemed really funny and kind, and most of all had a very tight-knit circle of friends that seemed to love her a lot. I had friends but none of them close (I moved around a lot as a kid, and when my parents finally retired I was of the age where people already had their close group of friends, so I was always a kind of outsider friend.) I was at first jealous that my boyfriend had dated such a great girl, which triggered my own deep insecurities. But soon the jealousy melted into awe, and the feeling I had was just that I wished I was this girl's friend, and I wished I was in her close friend group. I snooped her page very often, sometimes multiple times a day, sometimes a few times a week - it went in waves. I would save every photo she posted of herself, which I still do to this day and have a folder specifically for images of her.

As the years went on I never forgot her. Even after I left my boyfriend, I would still frequently visit her page. I started googling her, and trying to find out as much about her life as I could. I found her phone number online, and called it once (from my workplace) just so I could hear what her voice sounded like. I dyed my hair her favourite colour, listened to the music she listened to, tried to get a little of her magic into my left. But although as I got older I met new friends and got closer to them, I still felt deeply alone. I'm lucky with these friends, but as I mentioned before I was late on the scene, and they've already had their friendships for 25+ years. I have no ride or die best friend, but this girl has a huge crew of them, and I simultaneously love looking at her life with her friends, while also feeling deeply sad for my own lack of that closeness.

The latest straw is that I created a fake social media profile yesterday and contacted her on there, just commenting on some friend drama I saw on facebook, pretending it was one of her friends messaging from an anonymous account so I didn't make her mad while I gave my opinion on something. Anyway, she was upset (rightly so), and said I was a fucked up person to be getting involved in friend drama, since she figured out I'm just a stranger. Weirdly up until that moment I knew my behaviour wasn't totally normal, but I didn't realize the extent of it. I'm just beginning to realize how UTTERLY FUCKED UP my actions have been for many years, obsessing over this girl I've never met.

If you've read this far, thank you. I need help. I know no one here can give direct advice/diagnoses etc., and that's ok. But if any of you can relate and have gotten away from this behaviour, what worked for you? Any books, websites, etc. that you can recommend so I can learn more about this behaviour and try to stop it? I know the term catfishing, but besides that one sock puppet account I haven't really done that much, so I don't think reading more on that would be helpful. I just need something to figure this all out, and I don't have money right now for a therapist. Thank you for any advice you can give me. I will be politely setting aside all comments about how fucked up I am, I already know that about myself, I'm just seeking some constructive words or a direction I can go in to improve this situation.

Edit: This is 11 years of weird behaviour, I'm leaving out a lot of details. In order to 'feel closer' to this girl I started following some of her friends on Instagram etc. And have actually arranged to meet 2 of them in real life (one to buy some fruit from their farm, another for a tarot reading) just to see people in this friend group in real life. To bask in the glow of these interesting and warm people. Ugh...I feel like shit even typing this out, but the more detail the better I guess.",22Apr2020,1
156,"\*I joined Reddit to ask this question, so apologies for any etiquette breaches\*

Two years ago, I met a guy (“Dan”) on a month-long trip with a small group of six students (we were 19, now we're 21). We immediately hit it off (in a platonic sense) and hung out pretty much only with each other for the whole month in a foreign country, living together, eating together, etc. There was a brief period where there was a little tension where it felt like there might be something beyond friendship there, but I’m bad at picking up on that and might have misinterpreted, and in any case neither of us brought it up, and by the end of the trip we were really close in a platonic sense. At the time, I knew he had depression and anxiety and he would occasionally talk to me about it. After the trip was over, we texted each other basically every day for a year. For context, Dan's a pretty reserved person. When we were both starting college in the fall and were both struggling to make friends, it was great to be able to lean on him, even over text.

Then, a year ago, I started noticing that his responses were a lot shorter than mine, and he didn’t initiate questions as much as he had just a few months before, and so (since I’m a little paranoid about bothering people) I convinced myself that he wanted to end the conversation and so I decided to give him an out, and left him on read. I waited for him to initiate a conversation. Dan never did, which basically confirmed all of my fears that I was bothering him and so I took 6 months (until last summer), just telling him that I was in the city where he goes to college for a summer job and asking if he wanted to hang out. He was again fairly short, just saying he wasn’t staying at school for the summer and we talked for a few days, and then he left me on read. Again, I freaked myself out about it, convinced myself he didn’t want to talk to me or I was coming on too strong, and didn’t text him back until this January, when I was spending a night in the city en route to somewhere else and asked if he wanted to get food or something. He facetimed me and explained that he’s been in inpatient psychiatric care (in the fall, a wilderness program that takes away your phone) since late summer and I think he’s still there. We started texting again, but Dan left me on read a few weeks later.

I gave him space for 6 weeks, and then this Sunday night (three days ago) I tried to facetime him. He didn’t pick up and hasn’t called back or texted. He’s in a program where I think they go on backcountry expeditions and so I wouldn’t be surprised if he were somewhere without his phone, but there’s a big part of me that’s worried he’s tired of talking to me. We were really close, and I miss him as a friend. I want to be there for him in this really shitty time in his life, but I also definitely don’t want to smother him or continue bothering him if he doesn’t want to talk. Am I bothering someone who just wants to be left alone, or am I misreading signs of mental illness where you push everyone away, or am I just reading way too much into all of this? Please advise.

My girlfriend suffers from anxiety and depression, and whenever she attempts to have a shower, she almost always suffers a panic attack and constantly feels disgusted with herself.

I had a verbally abusive father who died when I was 16. I was unofficially homeschooled - meaning I didn't have any schooling - until I started college at 22. I just turned 30 last month.

I think I have a victim complex. Here's why:

* I always feel like an underdog and that I'm going to lose in any situation I go into, because I'm worse than the people or thing I'm going up against
* Whenever I do lose, like in a game, a sport, or something goes wrong, I feel a weird sense of satisfaction
* I feel driven to complain to others about poor me, I lost, didn't get what I want, I was right, etc
* A voice in my head tells me I can never get things that I want. For a current example, there's a ""girl of my dreams"" situation (sister of a good friend), and signs point to me getting a shot with her in the future. But the voice keeps telling me it's not gonna happen, she wouldn't like me anyway, etc. Same things happen with me playing games or sports, losing weight, etc. I always assume I'm going to lose.

I don't know if that fits the definition of a victim complex, but I hate that about myself.

170,"Coping with depression is no easy task. The mood disorder is characterized by feelings of hopelessness, emptiness, loneliness, and excessive guilt for extended periods of time. Individuals with major depressive disorder will experience episodes lasting at least two weeks. Individuals with persistent depressive disorder experience episodes lasting significantly longer—more than two years in adults and more than one year in children and adolescents.

The symptoms of depression extend beyond low mood. Patients may also have a lack of motivation, find it difficult to concentrate, be unable to anticipate feelings of fulfillment or happiness, and may have recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. Depression can also bring on feelings of fatigue and may alter sleeping and eating habits. Taken together, these symptoms can disrupt patients’ social lives and careers.

Depression is distinct from sadness or bereavement caused by a major life event such as the death of a loved one—though those who are prone to depressive disorders may experience a depressive episode because of such an event. For those with major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder (also known as dysthymia), depressive episodes are not always tied to a specific event and may seem to arise for no discernible reason. However, when one is experiencing a depressive episode, one may begin to view the world through a depressive schema.

Such a schema is not merely an analog to the medieval melancholic or the eternal pessimist who sees the proverbial glass as always ""half empty."" There may be neurobiological evidence to support what many individuals who have struggled with depression have experienced. It may also support the claim of [Aaron Beck](http://cognitivetherapynyc.com/docs/arosnonintro.pdf), the father of cognitive therapy, who proposed that depression could be described as a cognitive disorder wherein negative information is given a higher priority than positive or neutral information.

What Causes Depression?

Despite being one of the most widespread forms of psychiatric pathology, the simple answer is that researchers are not certain. As noted above, some depressive episodes may be triggered by trauma, but other factors—including one’s neurochemistry, one’s neural architecture, and how well one’s brain responds to stress—can have an impact on how susceptible an individual is to depression.

While it is clear that genetics play a key role in determining one’s risk of developing depression, there does not appear to be a single neurobiological cause. Researchers have identified more than 100 genes and their alleles that can affect an individual’s neurochemistry, neural architecture, or ability to effectively process stress. This has led to multiple theories to explain the onset of depressive episodes and the reason why some individuals are more prone to them than others.

The latter may seem surprising, since stress is not typically associated with depression. However, excessive stress or the body’s response to perceived stress appears to play a crucial role in the development of depression and may even alter neural architecture. Stress can affect specific regions of the brain, particularly the limbic system (which includes the amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus), and may lead to physical changes in brain structure, including impaired nerve growth.

A [study](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/19/12/5034.short) published in the *Journal of Neuroscience* found that the hippocampus was between 9 percent and 13 percent smaller in depressed women when compared to women who did not suffer from depression. Furthermore, the difference in hippocampus volume was more pronounced among women who had experienced more depressive episodes throughout their lifetimes, suggesting a correlation between the number of depressive episodes and hippocampus volume. Other [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10889528) have proposed that impaired neurogenesis in or an underdevelopment of the hippocampus is not a consequence of depression, but rather its antecedent.

Negative Memory Storage and the Hippocampus

The hippocampus plays a central role in recollection and the encoding of episodic memories. Episodic memories are believed to be stored in clusters of neurons known as [engrams](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10683-2), and individual engrams are believed to be associated with individual memory traces. Specific engrams corresponding to individual pieces of information, researchers have found, can be tagged using Ca2+ imaging. Consequently, one can observe a pattern that corresponds with memory creation, memory processing, and memory retrieval.

The hippocampus also plays a role in processing negative or stressful information, which suggests that it could be possible to test the cognitive theory of depression proposed by Beck in a lab. Using murine models, researchers at the Douglas Hospital Research Centre at McGill University in Montreal recently did just that.

The experiment utilized the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model to observe engrams in the hippocampi of mice believed to be susceptible to stress and a separate group believed to be resilient. The team hypothesized that susceptible animals would have a hippocampus that is more sensitive to stress, that these animals would have more hippocampal engram cells related to stress, and that depressive behavior would be observed by reactivating the engram cells corresponding with stressful experiences. Resilient animals, they reasoned, would not have an increase in hippocampal engram cells related to stress.

The team, Zhang et al, [published their findings](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2019/08/12/JNEUROSCI.1958-18.2019) in the *Journal of Neuroscience* in August. They discovered that,

&gt;“Compared to resilient or non-stressed control mice, susceptible mice exhibited a higher reactivation of social defeat-related… engram cells… in both the dorsal and ventral hippocampal CA1 regions. The density of CA1 engram cells correlated with the level of social avoidance... Our findings that negative memory engrams are increased in mice that are susceptible to CSDS suggested that these engrams could mechanistically contribute to the negative bias of memory formation in depression.”

In other words, mice that retained more negative information were more likely to revisit the negative memory and behave in a depressed manner, whereas mice that retained less negative information were less likely to revisit the memory and behave in a depressed manner.

While this major study may not answer our questions about the direction of causality between negative memory bias and depression, it does indicate that the hippocampus does play a significant role in reinforcing depressive behaviors. It also does give greater credence to Beck’s contention that depression can be viewed as a cognitive disorder, though it does not necessarily negate any theoretical paradigm about depression. Consequently, the team concluded their paper on an optimistic note about what this study could mean for patients: “Inhibiting negative memory engrams in the hippocampus could be a novel therapeutic approach for treating cognitive symptoms in depression.”

More studies are needed to confirm these results and to explore how negative memory engrams could be successfully inhibited, but this could potentially be a step in providing new forms of treatment for one of the most widespread and debilitating mental illnesses in the world. These novel approaches may also allow us to better understand the complex web of biological and psychological components that are the underlying causes of depression and take more proactive steps to prevent it.",22Apr2020,1

If someone would be willing to go into specifics with me you can message me but otherwise I'm just looking for general advice of how to deal with worsening paranoia.

I've talked about it a little with my girlfriend but some of the paranoia is pointing towards her and there is no reason for it. I feel guilty about it because she's been nothing but supportive and amazing so I avoid talking about it with her.

182,"I have always hated school. I fucking hate it so much. I feel like I don't learn anything valuable 90% of the time. It's just people spouting random facts at you, you regurgitate it, then forget. Rinse and repeat. There are no tests based on understanding of concepts, just facts. The french revolution started in 1789, ive had that stuck in my brain since 10th grade, why did it start? People were starving I think? Don't know more than that. See what I mean? How the fuck does any date, fact, or anecdote help me be a better person, and live a better life? Then you do this song and dance for fucking years, and they hand you a piece of paper that says you are better, but you are not. I think about this a lot: what if instead of all the time I spent doing a bull shit class that I didn't learn anything in, which accumulated to immense amounts of time, I learned a trade? I'd already be making money, and set on my path, but I didn't do that. I went to community college which is basically High School MK2, and I have yet to learn anything different than what I did in high school. I'm not saying I don't learn, I do, its just most of the time its completely useless, or that time spent learning it could've been spent learning something of actual use, something that could be applied. History can always be applied, our world is literally all patterns and saying it repeats is a saying for a reason, but guess what, was I taught that? No, I learned it on my own through people, and just seeing the world, and thinking. Know what I did learn? The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, thats another thing that pisses me off, science is taught completely wrong, they tell you this summarized bull shit then tell you half of how it actually works, and then when you finally get your full answer on how it works you arent even in school anymore, go figure right? (It doesn't help though that the field of science is constantly changing so that one is not completely to their fault, but I still feel it is taught incorrectly). Don't even get me started on math. What a fucking waste. They teach you arithmetic right? But thats literally it. No applications for it, no reasons why you are learning it, none of that. When will I ever use calculus and logarithmic functions in my daily life? fucking never, I don't even know what part of life most of the math I have learned applies to, wanna know why? Cause no one ever told me. I have taken so much bull shit. They made me take first year experience my second year of college, and made me pay for it. What the actual fuck is that. The class was supposed to be about transitioning from HS to college but I already did that, and my teacher showed us pictures of her cats in class instead, then assigned ass loads of homework, believe it or not, not about her cats. This online shit is the breaking point for me, I havent been able to bring myself to do any of it, cause I know now more than ever I am not learning anything. Thats not what school is, school is not about learning. It's about doing a little dance in the form of taking a test, they say good job sport and hand you a piece of paper with a number on it, oh and the teachers are fucking miserable most of the time, cause they don't teach. They are too busy trying to program students for tests that keep changing every year, so the teacher cant develop their lessons over the years, cause they are constantly trying to keep up with the changing curriculum, cause you cant sell the same test over and over, so you have to make a new one. It's all about money, and its fucking bull shit. That applies to High School not college, but I feel very strongly the entirety of how we view education as a country needs to be changed (US). Am I the only one that thinks school shouldn't be hated by 80% of children? Why is it like this? It should be the opposite. Kids hate it because it is not made for them. It is made by some fucking dude, who has no perception of what its like to be a kid anymore, and is only concerned with keeping his ethos up so he can sell more tests, and text books to go with it, its a racket. We are all being scammed by these people. Having kids in a class room is the worst place to learn. It is like prison, why does no one teach by actually doing? I know not all things can be taught like that, but still. Forcing kids to sit in a room for fucking 6 hours is basically torture. The best classes I have ever took were always with a passionate teacher that didn't have a state mandated test at the end of the year, cause the ones that do, are always just trying to teach that, which is just facts, because its usually too much to teach in one year to begin with. My friend asked me: why dont you drop out? I'm not stupid, I know school is an investment in my future, and I know that stupid little piece of paper will make me more employable, but its not the end, its the journey right? And the journey feels like a massive waste of time, most of the time. Notice how I didn't mention English? You gotta learn your own language be that even if we make it 10x harder and more complicated for ourselves, and usually English classes are the ones where I learn the most, with reading books, short stories, and talking with my teachers (when they are actually good). Not to say To Kill a Mockingbird is a bad book, not in the slightest, but I could do without having read it four times. Why the fuck is there no life class? No emotional management class? No relationship class? Money management? Ethics class? Maybe even a class to try and remove racism (I know that one isn't realistic). None of those exist, and are equally if not more important than STEM and other classes. I took economics and it wasn't useful at all, it couldve been, we were learning important stuff, it just got watered down by the unimportant, and the style of the teacher. This would never work, but a class on politics would be nice too, like understanding what each party believes, and maybe even how we are tearing our country apart by trying to fit 350 million fucking people into 2 niche categories then wonder why everyone is fighting, but thats a different grievance I have. Oh and foreign language, I spent 4 years learning Spanish in high school, and now if I ever get kidnapped in mexico I can tell them I have to use the bathroom. Best way to learn a new language is to go to that country If I spent half the time learning Spanish, in Spain, I would be fluent, but then the Mexicans probably wouldnt understand my Spanish jargon so I guess Mexico it is. I guess I just wanted to rant about schooling. Feel free to debate with me if you disagree with anything I have said. Also philosophy should be a class in every high school, taught since middle school, and like actually philosophy, not just knowing what philosophers think and spitting it out on a test, it should be taught how to be a philosopher, by definition. I think high school should end earlier, I think many, many seniors, including myself, literally just fucked around all of senior year, hence the existence of the term, ""senioritis"" oh and just a semantics thing, don't add ""itis"" at the end of words you want to sound like a disease, itis means inflammation, not disease the correct suffix to use is ""osis"" as in osteoporosis, as said by the simp in the wheel chair playing Pokemon go. Anyway I hope you are all surviving through quarantine, its important to remember that no one is happy right now, everyone is sucky, no one likes being stuck at home for this long, and its normal to have days where you just don't do shit, but its important to realize that, let it be okay, then do shit the next day. Good luck out there in this crazy world.

183,"this might be a long one.. i don't expect anyone to read it. i just need to get this off my chest.

trigger warning: sexual assault

i was sexually assaulted a little over 6 years ago, when i was 13. i didn't really deal with it honestly, just repressed it and really withdrew and isolated myself from my friends. i'm indian and my mom was really paranoid, a mixture of the implications of puberty and aftermath of the Nirbhaya incident. aside from the fact that i found it incredibly difficult to talk about, i knew for a fact that i didn't want parents to know because what little freedom i had to leave home would be taken away.

all this while i've been forcing down any residual memories and i didn't want to reach out to a counsellor because i was a minor and again didn't want my parents to know. i started college last year and plucked up the courage to see the counsellor because i've been remembering details of incident and i want to get over it.

quarantine has been so tough because i left just after i told her about the assault. she's the only person i've told. i'm almost relieved. but i also think about it more often than i have been since it happened.

after uni shut down, my mom and i went to her parents' bec my grandad was due for surgery for a pacemaker. we've been here since, without my dad because all transport's been stopped.

my grandad's brother died unexpectedly last week and that coincided with my grandmom coming down with a bacterial infection. it wasn't that serious but they hospitalised her and i kinda had to pull my weight and make arrangements for the last rites and drive my gdad to the funeral home and help him contact the insurance people. and i'm so exhausted i could cry. i've been so numb yet overwhelmed and it only really hits me in the shower when i have a moment to myself. it's also finals week and i've written to the head of my year at uni to ask for some way to make up for my really poor performance this past week but idk what to expect really.

But today was the final straw I guess. I've been working for a horrible boss for about two years, and today she began to jump down my throat over something that isn't even possible, and it happened. I got really angry.

I still am, and it's really weird. My blood feels like it might jump out of my skin. My chest feels like it's full of bees. I'm not used to this. I want to drive off a cliff, but also I want to write a book. I want to punch her in the throat, but also I want to paint a fucking forest fire.

Hurting, bleeding, throwing up, giving up on life. But I'm a fighter. Last year, I started going to therapy, and I have made some serious progress. I even managed to land a job in January, which gave me a high like I'd never felt before. Suddenly, I was out there, making new friends, enjoying our beautiful office, having sex, going out, just living my life to the fullest. Then.. The quarantine happened. And I'm back in this room. It's been 5 weeks since I last saw our office. My colleagues. And I'm not taking it well. I fight. I exercise, I eat healthy. I meditate. I talk to my therapist every 2 weeks over Skype, but it's just not the same, and I'm forced to keep my voice down and pray no one else overhears me. I can feel myself slowly lose motivation to do anything. I can't even work on personal art. I feel alone. Detached. Demotivated. Back in this room, where I've suffered so much. I try so hard to stay positive. But there's no denying it, if I don't find an answer to my problem fast, I'm going to relapse. I don't want to relapse. I don't know what to do.

They are super strict and can never accept the fact that they’re wrong about something. Hell, they even yell at me for “playing too much video games”.

196,"Totally new here so I apologise in advance I don’t mean any offence from misusing terms etc.
Basically I’m extremely concerned that I may be suffering from Bipolar disorder and that I’m currently in a manic state.
I have struggled my whole liek with going through phases of depression then randomly having days of great highs which generally calm down within a week. This is then followed for months of feeling completely normal. 
However recently I had been suffering from depression in general and roughly 3 weeks ago my boyfriend broke up with me. It was totally unexpected and I was extremely hurt as I thought everything was fine but it turned out he has been planning to leave me for ages. I was completely distraught. Honestly the couple do days were a blur, didn’t sleep, didn’t eat, lots of crying. Anyway since then I have been feeling the lowest I ever have in life, probably getting around 2 hours sleep a night, 0 appetite I have had thoughts of suicide ( no wish to act on it) and generally all I can say is I’ve never felt so depressed. I thought this was maybe exaggerated because my country is currently in lock down.
However this morning I found out that my ex had been slept with somebody else a week before breaking things off with me. When I first heard this news I expected to me upset but instead I have had this horrible feeling ever since. It’s like I’m high. Like I feel excited happy but on an abnormal level, I’m so high energy and texting my friends all these crazy quick messages, laughing at everything I see on my phone. But everything feels distorted it’s not like I’m just happy and that wouldn’t make sense either right? I’ve still got no interest in food and sleep doesn’t seem imminent. I’m really concerned that I may be suffering some kind of manic episode. My uncle suffers from bipolar disorder badly (has been hospitalised before) but I’m not close to him and don’t know the extent of his illness. I feel like I’m going crazy ive never felt this way in my life and I’m genuinely scared I’m going to do something stupid I’ve already texted people crazy stuff not done anything real yet.

199,"I am a 20 year old male studying at university in the UK. For many years of my life when growing up I was bullied, which I think has contributed to what I think is an inferiority complex. I told teachers but they couldn't stop what was happening and I had few close friends. I also rarely told my parents and actively tried to hide it although in a few situations it was impossible.

A year and a half ago, I began my first relationship with a girl I had been friends with for years. She had been bullied like I had and had been diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 15, she was taking medication as a result. I was really happy with her and she believed I also had the mental problems she had, she also tried to convince me a few times to seek professional help but I declined. Our relationship became toxic and she began to verbally and emotionally abuse me almost every other day. She began a cocaine habit and cheated on me with someone she had met hours earlier. She told me a day later and after a week we broke up. I was emotionally destroyed and to this day I haven't fully recovered, still thinking about her and miss what we had.

My closest friend who knows all about this, is also wanting me to get professional help and I did a few months ago. I was sceptical but happy I had made the appointment. But when it got time to talk with the professional, I got really anxious and I doubted everything I said. I couldn't remember what was true and was questioning everything I was thinking. He told me to talk to the well-being staff at my university but I was too nervous to do so considering this experience.  

Here's why I don't want to: my Mum is really worry-some. She told me last week that she worries about me everyday and I know she would be on my back for the rest of her life if I even indicated to her that I might have a mental problem. One day a few years ago I was down so she called me up to her room and interrogated me about having depression (she always assumes the worst). She also has a medical condition where if her blood pressure gets too high, she'll collapse and possibly die (she collapsed while pregnant with my sister) so I don't want to take the chance. If someone has to suffer, I would always chose myself over her. I've also had conversations with my dad where he states that 'people my age all have depression' and that he's glad I'm one of the few who doesn't. I know that I'm an adult now so I can make my own decisions and seek help without them but I don't doubt that they would find out eventually, due to how curious and intruding my mum is.

So this has been going on for honestly as long as I remember and it’s kind of hard to explain but essentially i frequently fall into sort of ‘daydreams’ where i imagine someone is watching my life through my eyes. It’s usually people I’m interested in who i’m not close with, or (before my current relationship) crushes. Sometimes i pretend they can feel what i feel and they’re experiencing my life in a weird simulation, or other times they can just watch through my eyes. It gets so vivid that it impacts the way i act; i listen to specific music to impress them and act more interesting than i really am. I know it’s not real and i can shake it off if i’m busy and can’t focus on these random people watching my life, but it just feels weird and wrong and egotistical in a way.
It’s like i want these people to see how amazing my life is and how i’m such a cool person, when really I’m extremely insecure and my life isn’t any better than other people’s. I’ve suffered from depression in the past and am currently dealing with anxiety and ocd, which have been present pretty much my whole life. I don’t know if this is a weird symptom of ocd, sort of like a coping mechanism, but i’m worried people will think I’m crazy if i tell them about people watching my life through my eyes.

Or, I'll leave my phone in another room so I don't get tipsy and start texting everyone. People say I'm hilarious, they love my stories, and they admire how comfortable I am at speaking my mind and being ""real."" But I know the entire time they are just waiting on me to shut up. I can't help that my personality is a byproduct of my upbringing, with a few mental health issues coded into my DNA. The worst part is, now that I know I'm ""that person"" , I don't know how to stop being annoying. I didn't have a lot of control over my life and things that happened to me growing up, and my therapist says that is why I feel I have to be perfect and likeable, and why I feel I have to control everything now as an adult. If anyone calls me out on my behavior, I get extremely defensive, because that means I'm not good enough. Which then turns into, I'm not ""likeable"" or I don't deserve love and affection. I hate this. I even fucking annoy myself. Anyway, just had to vent a bit. I don't really have anyone to say these things to that will understand.",22Apr2020,1

207,"A little background: I (24f) was raised in an incredibly broken, abusive, overly invasive AND detrimentally neglectful ""family."" My father was an alcoholic with the best intentions and worst implementation of them. He expected me to act like an adult and grow up quickly and reacted irrationally pretty much all the time. My mother was mostly absent, neglectful to the point that it was bad for my physical health (she slept often and locked my sister and I in a room with the dog, allowing me to crawl through dog shit and piss). My parents both have gaslighted me my entire life. They both have histories of being diagnosed with bipolar depression, and each show narcissistic tendencies. I also have always had abandonment issues due to the possibilty of a close relationship with my dad always dangling nearby but being so harmful and out of reach, and the absolute rejection of my mother. From the time I was born until a week after my 1st birthday, she held me for HOURS every day. And then suddenly she decided she didn't want to be a mom and left. Literally never picked me up or held me again. 

With all of that being said, as a child I had major issues with aggression, physically, emotionally, etc toward others. I also developed severe attachments to people where I tried to isolate them for myself, while also abusing and gas lighting them when I didn't get my way, without realizing I was doing that.
I have been diagnosed with general anxiety, bipolar depression, and ptsd. But I worry that my symptoms are of something worse and deeper like a narcissistic personality disorder or BPD. Although this was dismissed by my therapist, he believes I have maladaptive coping mechanisms and whenever I feel the way I did as a child I revert to the way I would have handled it at that time. 

My first relationship was incredibly toxic. I was more physically abusive, he was incredibly emotionally abusive and made me feel worthless. I started realizing the shit I was doing when I started googling how to handle everything he was doing to me. I found a lot of self help forums where I realized how toxic and selfish I was as well. That relationship ended with me thinking I had unlearned all my toxic traits and in my mind I could lable him as the only problematic one. (He did stalk me after we broke up) 

By my next relationship I was so bitter that I had ""allowed myself to be abused so long"" that I was on a quest to find ""better"" and he tried so hard to keep up but looking back I expected him to be perfect and he finally couldn't take it anymore.

That relationship ended with me realizing I have A LOT left to unlearn and although I need to have confidence in myself, I HAVE to allow other people to be human beings and stop taking everything so damn personal. 

And yet here i find myself in what could be the best relationship if only I'd, once again, stop expecting him to be perfect. And stop trying to control his actions to always be pleasing me. He's more than happy and willing to grow together but my overbearing nature has him miserable and walking on eggshells. I don't want to lose him and live in this never ending miserable cycle. He doesn't want to go either. He's giving me time to work on myself and shed my toxicity while still offering his love and support. I have watched a lot of videos on the subject and while it makes complete sense, when moments arise where I should be utilizing that info, I just forget it all, blow the situation out of proportion and make it all about how I feel and why he is wrong. 

I feel lost and like I'm consistently letting myself and him down because while I know how I should react, I still blow up, act passive aggressively, he explains how he feels and I realize it was a miscommunication, I then beat myself up, obsess over changing, and then repeat the behavior the next time an issue comes up. Rinse and repeat.

Has anyone recovered from something similar and do you have any tips for growing through this and genuinely bettering yourself? Please don't suggest therapy as my insurance has run out and it's really not a current option (with or without the threat of covid.)",22Apr2020,1

209,"Hi, so recently I've been struggling with lockdown, as I have lost motivation to work and be organised generally. Failure after failure has led me to start thinking that I have some mental disorder, such as Anxiety or ADHD, and I hate thinking about it. For days, weeks even I've been thinking about the same thing constantly, which is ADHD and it's symptoms, comparing and overanalysing everything to do with it, to the point of obsession. And to be honest, I'm sick of it. I'm sick of thinking that there's something wrong with me while simultaneously pointing out the times in the past when I convince myself of something (like last year, when I had my hearing tested, I had convinced myself because of tinnitus). I'm sick of feeling like I'm making up symptoms or over exaggerating them. It feels like I'm always worked up over something, that I cant just relax and just clear my head.",22Apr2020,1
