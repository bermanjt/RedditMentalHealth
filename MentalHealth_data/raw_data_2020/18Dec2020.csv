1,"Hi, in the last few weeks I've seen posts from people that i followed and, in my mind, look up to (and place on a pedastal which is probably bad!). 

Recently these people have been sharing politically aggravating views and propaganda designed to make people angry. I think they do it to make themselves feel like they are doing something good.

But seeing these things make me have conversations IN MY HEAD with them trying to argue that what they're doing is wrong. I know this is a waste of time and life! 

In general I am a logical person and therefore try to reason with facts 

I feel like this is bad for my own mental health.

Has anyone been in a similar position? I'm a bit worried about coming off social media for a bit but it might be a good thing.",18Dec2020,2
2,"I was a pretty sensitive kid. Those kind of emotions (crying, frustration etc) were sort of discouraged by kids at school who would make fun of me for it and my parents who couldn't be bothered dealing with it. So I pushed everything down every time I felt hurt and now I'm unable to cry, and generally feel a little scared to let myself feel painful emotions.

I really want to be able to cry again. I'm getting better at telling myself it's OK to hurt but it still feels like I have a long way to go before I heal. Does anyone have any tips on things that worked for them?",18Dec2020,2
3,"A few days ago after an appointment with my psychiatrist she prescribed me Abilify to help with psychotic symptoms and borderline personality disorder on top of Zoloft and Xanax that I've been taking for a while

So I told my mom about it and she said that I'm lying to my psychiatrist and that this is not a game, she doesn't really know what I feel or think inside my head because I don't talk but she's my mom and her words shook me.

I don't know if I'm feeling what I'm feeling or if I'm faking it, my thoughts are lying to me and I don't know what to believe anymore.

Maybe my parents were actually right all this time and I'm actually just worthless and lazy? What does it mean to be okay? How do I know if I'm not okay?
Seriously I'm freaking out I honestly feel like completely quitting talk therapy and psychotherapy because I feel like a fraud for even taking all of these medications, I don't know what or who to believe anymore. 

NOTHING MAKES SENSE, what little understanding i had of my mind has been completely shattered and now I dont know who I am and what I'm feeling, I cannot recognize any of the things I'm feeling.
Is it sadness? Depression? Anxiety? Happiness? Fear? Nothing?",18Dec2020,3

6,"Well, here is a discovery that I made today just a few minutes ago.

I work a low paying job in retail. I was making about $12/hr US ever since I picked up this job at the start of COVID. Anyway, about mid-October I was asked to pick up a shift or two at the gas station attached to my grocery chain, and one day. Something came up at work, and they decided to move me back to where I was working at the start of COVID when I made $12. I was told when I’d go back, I would see a little decrease in my rate back to $12 from the $13 I was making that little time at the gas station, but they lied about that.

Turns out, my rate was cut to $10/hr, and I have only been making that rate since they moved me back. I knew this job wasn’t paying all too well, and I was scrapping for cash as of late, but this just proves my feeling I was being underpaid.

Only to discover this before Christmas.

Honestly, it might just be time to quit the job sometime before my one year anniversary. This was the final nail for me. I have a BA, and I feel like it is wasted at this job.

Might be worth a talk to HR, but I dunno. I have to talk to them about a co-worker outing my Spectrum Disorder too, and that is something I am not comfortable talking about. I still dunno how he found out.",18Dec2020,1
7,"I have a question to ask.  Does your perception of your face change?  Does your perception change when you’ve received a compliment? 
For my entire life, my perception of my own face has changed drastically.  Yesterday a friend of mine, who models, complimented my “beautiful eyes” repeatedly.  Suddenly, I was beautiful.

10,"I hate that I can't find anyone to date, makes me feel like a loser and suicidal. I am not ugly or fat, but I hate socialising, I hate people in general because I feel everyone is against me. I live in a homophobic country and honestly the lgbt community in the western world makes me wanna puke. It doesn't matter that I live in a homophobic environment and have abusive parents cuz I'm a ""white cis gay"" who deserves to be hated even by other lgbt people, honestly I hate this ""community"", I wanted to move abroad but now I am not sure after I saw how shitty many lgbt people (especially those self hating white teenage girls who are all like ""bipoc lives matter, those of white people dont!"") actually are... I tried online dating, it didn't work, maybe I am too picky, I dunno, I had okcupid for a year and almost 2000 likes now yet nothing...

I just wanna try stop looking for a relationship but I feel like a loser for not dating anyone, I wish I could just stop and not care anymore, but how do I do that? I honestly considered chemical castration and suicide at this point because I feel depressed and that makes me less productive, I dont even have anything that brings me joy anymore, I just focus on studying and improving my body and in rest... I don't have anything that makes me happy. Maybe I believe that if I had a boyfriend I would be happy but that is probably not true, yet it is the only thing that keep me going because I have a crush on a guy in another country with whom I talk, i try to improve myself for him and if I give up I think it would be like giving up on myself, but at the same time I feel miserable every day because any guy I ever liked was A) straight or B) bisexual and only looking for hookups with guys or C) gay and a total dick.

TL;DR: How do I give up on trying to date? Never had a relationship, but cant accept that I never will and give up, how do I do that? I feel like I have nobody, but there are people who dont have anyone either yet they still cope, how do they do that?",18Dec2020,2

12,"So from as far back as I can remember I've had trouble sleeping, and I know that's pretty common at a young age but now getting near 18 it feels awkward and embarrassing.
When I actively want to sleep and try just laying down even when I'm tired, I find I start panicking because I'm not asleep yet and I want to be so I can do things the next day, and this quickly leads to uncontrollable crying and sometimes shaking a bit, but I cry to the point when I'm choking and feel like I'm about to throw up but still can't stop crying, and it can happen on and off all night, so when I calm down enough to try and sleep, then I just panic and just freak out again. 

Is this an illness, or does this issue have a name? Any ideas on what to do about it?

My solution so far has often been to just stay up, watch tv, listen to music, walk around, anything to stop the panic and loss of control that I get, until I'm physically too tired to stay awake. Occasionally I wont care about if I get to sleep so if I'm not wanting it then I can sleep reasonably normally, but that's a rare occurrence.",18Dec2020,1
13,"I'm usually a patient person but lately idk what it is. Every little thing pisses me off. Idk why suddenly the littlest things set me off into a mood lately. Pandemic, maybe not spending enough time with myself, is it my peers that are the root, other people. Idk. The thought alone has been pretty agrovating. Idk if it's a combination of all the stress being thrown at me lately and me not just being able to cope with it or the factor that something actually chewing at me. Things that have been getting to me pretty bad lately are like when someone keeps cutting me off mid sentence, or when someone gets in my way, or takes they're sweet time to get to the point. And other times are when I drop something, trip over something or little petty things like that. Even the most simple things effect my mood intensely. I'm trying to watch it but Idk what's up. Ugh.",18Dec2020,2
14,"I feel like I'm more exposed to second hand smoking since living alone in a different country. I just see so many people smoke these days, from teenagers I see online to adults on the streets. 
My dad has been smoking ever since I was born, he smokes around me, in front of me, beside me, and it's like he doesn't care when I cough. I clearly was and still is not interested in joining him. Moreover, I'm scared that I will end up being addicted to smoking like my dad, because he cannot quit even though there are rare instances where he wants to.

But one day I was lost on the streets trying to get to a bus station and I asked the nearest person. She was smoking and she was still smoking even when I'm near her. The smell of the nicotine was so strong it went through my mask, and for the first time in my life, it doesnt smell that bad to me. I was so mad at myself.

I'm also very sad in general right now, and thats why I'm here, because a first thought that came to my mind is whether I should smoke or not. 

Now whenever I smell it I just wanna physically get away from it, because it reminds me too much of my dad and I don't wanna have that self-prophecy bullshit. 

I have never smoked, and I'm generally really anxious. I have traumas and I have OCD.

Please, any answer will be appreciated.",18Dec2020,2
15,"My parents got divorced 5 years ago ( I’m a minor) and I went to go live with my mom. We did have some financial struggles but it was all pretty. Then in the summer of 2018 my dad got custody back. We now still live with him and he constantly says if not for us he would have killed our mother a long time ago. So because of his hatred of our mother we can’t talk to him about it. This has all come to a head about 1 hour ago I had my first mental breakdown, it lasted for 45 minutes and I was in tears thinking about my mother( I haven’t seen her in person in about 5-8 months) it started downstairs in the kitchen when I was just thinking about her cooking and then when I realised this was going to be the first Christmas I wasn’t going to see her for. I suddenly had the urge to cry so I came up to my room and just bawled after about 25-30 minutes I had calmed down enough to try to talk to a friend about my problems. She was very helpful and just let me pour my guts out. So I’m still crying a little bit but not as much and I just wanted to put this somewhere into words.

Everything I do is heavy and requires a lot of effort. I always have this sense of dread that I can’t seem to get rid of and am constantly having panic attacks. I have a constant ache in my chest and am overcome by extreme emotions very easily. 
For example I sobbed to the point of choking and heaving for hours over being sent a meme picture of someone who’s been gone for a very long time.
I feel like I want to scream, claw apart my chest and curl into a ball all at the same time.

18,"I wanna vent. I feel like shit to be honest. I feel like things that have happened in my life that are bad and traumatic, I look back at them, and start to feel bad and I start to regret things and I start to get depressed. Everyone from my school hates me (don't know why I don't speak to any of them and I am always nice) but they just do. They talk bad about me and I am hurt by that. I have no friend in school and I don't have any friends outside of school. Everyone from my class/school goes to parties get wasted, get high and drink alcohol and party and make friends and post it on their social media. It is not because I am jealous, but I kinda feel jealous. I feel like I am wasting my life doing nothing at home and not experiencing anything. But I can not go out and make an effort because they dislike me and are really rude and I feel weird and out of place. Girls from my school/class post pictures with underwear or swimming suits and get a lot of likes, they have a lot of followers and stuff and they are so pretty while I am sitting at home doing nothing and I have the worst body. I am fat, and I am the fattest one in my class. I feel like the fattest person in my school (my school is private with rich kids, and they all really like sports) My family is not fortunate, and I came in the school on an academic scholarship. My parents don't pay for the school and some people from my class have told me that my family are using this country (my family is immigrant, I am the only non-white person in my grade) and stuff like that. I talk to no one in my school and I am alone. I was bullied when I was a kid, and I know this sounds so weird. But I look back at it again and I start to feel bad. I feel sad. My grades have begun going downhill and I don't feel like I have control over anything in my life and I hate that feeling. My mom is sick and we have NO money and my dad is working and fighting with my mom. My brother is doing lord knows what he is always in trouble and people from my school know that and always shame me for him calling him a criminal and that he smokes and sells weed. (He don't do that they just assume that and I know that for a fact) while they are out partying every weekend SMOKING WEED AND CIGARETTES AND SMOKING IN SCHOOL. I maybe feel out of place because my school is all white and most of them have very conservative views and are republican. They say very hurtful things about immigrants and I am an immigrant. They also say a lot of racist, islamophobic, anti-semitic and things like that. I once said to a boy that he should stop saying the n-word because he used it a lot and he just said shut up and he decides what comes out of his mouths. These people annoy me so much, and these girls from my school go and they say a lot of racist slurs and hurtful things while they go to parties trying to get to know people with from the city with another ethnicity (that they talk bad about). I just feel like shit and a waste of space tbh. I know this post have a lot of grammar issues but I was venting here and wrote it all down very fast.",18Dec2020,0

Lonely soldier by: Nickolas Aaron 

I feel like a soldier, not all the times, just sometimes, i feel like a lonely soldier battling a invisible and lonely war but a war with myself, it's like I'm in a field, alone,sad,angry and ready to win the fight but then, but then the war starts and i can't remember where i am, who i am and why i am there to begin with, i hear gunshots and i feel the bullets in my skin but i don't know where they are coming from. 

I'm alone in a field covered up by my own blood by my own sweet and then i see it, i see my friends my true family in front of me, they're running trying to get into me but they're too slow, walking too slowly,talking too loud, running as fast as they can but sometimes it doesn't matter how fast they're running cuz sometimes the faster that they can is not the fast that is need. 

I'm in the field covered up by my own blood eyes closed too tired to be open, bullets around me on the floor just like me, i open my eyes for just a second and i see then, my friends my true family, they are close but it's already too late.

I'm in a field my body already cold my thoughts stoped in time and my family my family above me crying wondering why.

26,"hey so i'm a girl, 18 years old, just graduated highschool this year and newly diagnosed with bpd anywho i think it's weird because my parents go out of their way to get me help but when i DO get help it's not fast enough for them. like they hate my therapist cause she questions their parenting methods (i.e them screaming at me and recording me when i get sad or upset and stick up for myself or get uncontrollable anger) and they also don't like her because they haven't seen any immediate results or big changes meanwhile i've only been seeing her for a year about once a month, sometimes more if she thinks i need more. anywho i tried bringing up my borderline personality disorder to my mom the other day and she got upset with me saying things like; ""can we not talk about that right now??"" ""i don't need something that'll make me all upset before i go to work"" like okay? my mental illness makes you upset?? it's literally a part of my life and won't leave anytime soon and you think it makes YOU upset? like all she thinks it is, is a mental illness that makes me suicidal and unsure of my identity meanwhile it just causes me to get really angry and have abandonment/trust issues and impulsivity. and i once also tried to tell her that part of my mental disorder is impulsivity especially if i'm getting involved in risky situations like sexual activity and she said ""i don't need to hear your excuses"" but i told her ""but they aren't excuses, they're explanations behind my behaviour"" and she said to stop talking to her and that i was only going to make her angry.. how can they care about me so much and want me to get better if they won't even listen to me. she won't even come into a therapy session with me so my therapist can help explain either and my therapist is genuinely concerned abou my relationship with my parents... like she was saying it seems they lack empathy in moments where i've needed them most.. this summer i was at my friends house and i got my heart broken by a guy my mom found out i was having sex with and she would constantly say how he's just using me and shit which wasn't true but anyways that night i got my mom to pick me up from my friends house and all she had to say was ""i told you so"". no hug. no it'll be okay. no i'm sorry honey. like she is literally the physical embodiment of my anxiety and everything my brain would tell me. none of it's true but it doesn't make me feel better... oh yeah and after all that i impulsively started drinking alcohol and doing drugs. i've been  a little better since then but i still frequently smoke weed or eat edibles so i don't have to think or feel and occasionally engage in hookups but i think i'm starting to lose myself again.. i don't know how to explain that without my parents getting angry since they won't even hear me out when i wanna talk about my bpd",18Dec2020,2

28,"Does anyone else have this going on? I (30F) am highly sensitive to and bothered by angry outbursts in men. I grew up with a emotionally volatile (often angry to the point of blind rage) father who would frequently fly off the handle and scream at me, my sister, and my mom. He was never physically abusive or anything, though. We think the root cause of it was depression. He’s now medicated for the depression and is an entirely different person. Can manage his emotions much more effectively. 

I now experience intense visceral reaction to to displays of extreme rage in others, especially in males. Even if the anger isn’t directed at me, I have a hard time staying calm. I start having heart palpitations, hyperventilating, and sometimes crying. It’s like a fear/panic response. IDK. 

I’m married to a good man who has never been violent toward me, but he does get angry and takes it out on things. For example, he will get ‘gamer rage’ when he’s losing a game and launch into a tirade of expletives, sometimes breaking things (he’s broken a few controllers), and stomping around. Even though the anger isn’t directed at me, I experience the same panic response.

Has anyone else experienced something similar?  Could this be a PTSD thing? Curious to hear from others. I’m trying to find ways to move past this. I understand that anger is a normal human emotion and it’s okay for people to express it. I just need to find ways to control my reaction, so I don’t completely shut down.",18Dec2020,3

36,"Recently I've been thinking about talking to my school counciler. I've been struggling with feelings of depression and occasional anxiety for what I think must be over a year now. At first it wasn't to bad which is why I haven't talked to anyone about it but for the last few months I've been feeling extremely unmotivated with everything I do. I find little to no enjoyment in hobbies i used to do, I've got a low appetite and I feel tired mentally. I cant differentiate days, and when I try to remember the last few weeks everything just merges into one blurry waste of time.

I haven't talked to my parents about my mental health as I feel uncomfortable talking to them about things like this. I feel like if I tell my mum she will blame herself or not take it seriously? 

I have shared some thoughts with a close friend but only skimming the surface, just things like ""I'm not feeling to good today"" ect. And talking to him about other issues I'm experiencing. I dont really feel like fully opening up to him will help. because he has his own mental health problems, and talking to him will make me feel extremely guilty about feeling depressed because it feels like I dont have a proper reason/excuse to experience these feelings.

I want to get help, but I'm not sure if talking to a school councillor is the best idea? 
Firstly I dont know how confidential they will be, secondly, i get anxious at the thought of asking a  teacher at school to speak to a  counciler, I feel like i will be judged by them idk how to explain it? 

Yeah idk what to do but I'm really struggling rn so if anyone knows what I can do please reply?",18Dec2020,1
37,"I used to be a 4.000 student in all honors classes and all sorts of clubs. I was so happy with life last year in the fall. Then the semester ended and I felt like I failed my favorite teacher. I told myself I’d finish my work in their class later this year even though I wouldn’t have them anymore. Then the second semester started and I still had great work ethic. Besides a few more things like assignments that were like a week or two old, 90% of my assignments were still completed and perfect. 
-
Then covid hit. It pretty much felt like summer because I had 2 weeks off. I procrastinate but I still get things done. My school after the 2 weeks went online and to pretty much sum it up, I never failed miserably and didn’t do anything for until a month before school ended. I just did nothing and didn’t do anything online besides one chem class. I, for the first time, was seriously ignoring my grades. I still had some instincts left though because in 2 weeks, I got most stuff caught up. However, my grades were terrible that quarter. I didn’t fail anything though. 
Now it’s the new school year and besides the bare minimum like an essay that would still be turned in 3 weeks late, I didn’t do anything so far. My diminishing instincts would kick in at the end of 1st quarter and I’d get a lot done but 5 of my classes were either failing or D’s. It’s almost the end of the semester now and I have so much to do. I don’t know why I don’t do it. I just lost all motivation. It’s 8pm tonight and full of opportunities to get stuff done and I can’t bring myself to do anything anymore. I just lay on my phone for hours at a time. I used to have plans to go to a very prestigious medical school and I don’t think I can do that anymore. I got diagnosed with type 1 diabetes 5 months ago and wanted to work on insulin pumps to help make my life and others’ better. 
All of my teachers are so forgiving and are literally giving me every opportunity known to man to help me. 
Here’s some background info. My friend circle (maybe 10 people) is prestigious. The top 7 people in class ranking for grades are all in my friend group. Because of this I feel so stupid and can’t talk to them about my problems. I tried to a bit and they gave the boomer response of “just do it; you spend hours a day on your phone.” One of my friends was really helpful last year during the covid online school but he has since gone to the “just do it” response. This is the first thing to mention.
I don’t want to die. It just seems like my life is getting worse and worse and I can’t do anything about it. I’ve played piano for a long time and stopped practicing. I try to work and I just get so burnt out so easily. At the end of last year, I had the will power to pull a triple all-nighter and get months of online work done and although I’ll still have times where I get insane motivation and stay up all night working, I never have any other motivation moments. 
I told my parents how I feel and they laughed. They made a joke and made me feel like an idiot. My dad can see my grades and said I was going to be a worthless failure. I’ve tried to disconnect him from me emotionally but that hit me. I feel an impending doom coming towards me. There’s an ultimatum in that I **cannot** fail this semester. That would lock out any chance at me having a future in medical school. I don’t know what I’m going to do. My school gets out tomorrow for Christmas break and I have the ability to get caught up over break but because I haven’t gotten anything done so far, I highly doubt I’m going to randomly have the motivation over break. I’ve been trying different options for what I’ve been experiencing and just about all have been ineffective and haven’t been fruitful. I don’t have anything diagnosed but I relate to many r/adhd and add posts so idk. That could also simply be me sharing a procrastinative mindset though.

She says she only uses it to sleep but I doubt that. Somedays she just doesn’t move at all, she lost over 30 pounds (she was already skinny). Idk what to do. Quarantine happened so it’s not like I should advice her to go out. I tried to have her talk to a psychologist about it but she refuses it. Somedays I feel like she thinks I am him. It’s been getting worse, my brother and I always looked alike and when he passed away he was close to be 18 and now I’ll be 18 soon.

Both sides have things I resonate with and also don't. Trying to think if I was born this way or made is difficult. My own opinion is I was born like this. My mother always said I was the ice man.

51,"I am a 16-year-old student, my highest grade on my card is A+ while my lowest would be a B+. I would've never expected to get one of the highest grades in class, in the middle of a pandemic, when I even have a sideline career in streaming on Twitch. Recently, I've decided to move to schools for senior high school, one of the requirements is the most latest report card. My school is pretty shitty, and they decided to release our report card when it was incomplete, I got an F in Health because our teacher had issues with her computer, so she couldn't compute our grades but our school assured us that isn't final. Now the grades have been updated, and I have one of the highest grades in class. 

I showed it to my mom, she rolled her eyes and brushed it off as if it was nothing. She began lecturing me that, I don't have to act all high and mighty just because I have very high grades, I should stop acting lazy and or pretend I'm doing anything. That moment, I disassociated with myself and I was just watching myself be berated in 3rd person. Everything was so blurry, and but her words were clear and hurtful. Instead of telling me to improve, she told me my grades might go down and accused me of always playing videogames. What makes it more worse, is that my mom knows I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety. So until now, I'm constantly checking my grades on my school's website and I can't think straight. I honestly had enough of my mother, and I wish to cut her off from my life when I'm of legal age. She would always berate me, belittle me, insult me about my appearance and interest and she even selectively chooses my friends. I really don't like my mom, I just never thought of this before because she would provide everything to me, but in the end, she never provided maternal love.",18Dec2020,1

56,"I have extreme social anxiety and general anxiety so it’s very hard for me to make friends and to form trust with people. I’ve had bad luck with friends. Growing up I hung out with the “cool” kids but they only hung out with me because they felt bad and that was only for two years. I had no friends and middle school and only started to get a solid friend group when I was a junior in high school. However, they are now all gone because I imploded on myself and dropped all of them because I was having a panic attack and freaked out. Now they all hate me and talk shit about me, my brother is still friends with all of them and doesn’t stand up for me when they do. It’s not like we have a bad relationship, my brother and I are close so I don’t know why he doesn’t. The main culprit is his girlfriend and my old best friend, who said I shouldnt compare myself to her because I’m a terrible person. I get it I’m a dick, especially while having a panic attack, but that just...hurt me I didn’t say anything bad to her while having my panic attack, she just said that thinking I couldn’t see it. Learning her turn feelings towards me and was my tipping point. After that I really bad suicidal thoughts. I didn’t have anyone and felt like I was a waste of space and just over all didn’t want to exist. It took a few months but I got over them because of this one friend I made, but honestly he made my mental health terrible. 

I felt like his short ugly friend, he would always talk about girls and how he sleeps with everyone and about girls bodies and how the perfect girl was skinny with big boobs and all that other stuff. This was just ruining my self esteem. I honestly don’t know why it did, I just cared a lot about his opinion. He began to talk about this one girl at our school and how she was perfect and skinny  and it was my tipping point. I had a mental break down over my appearance. When I look in the mirror I see an ugly fat troll. I stoped talking to him and I’ve basically stoped eating. I eat like a bowl or two of noodles a day and have lost 5lbs I think over two month. I know it’s not healthy but at this point I have a mental break down if I eat more than two meals a day. I’m honestly not even fat, I weight about 113lbs and I’m 5 foot 1. But every time I look in the mirror I just see a fat blob. I don’t think he did anything wrong though, I never told him to stop because I just don’t tell people how I feel.

I care to much about people’s opinions and it’s my down fall. I can tell the difference between a friendship and a relationship. Every friendship I’ve ever had has fizzled always because I hate starting conversations  or because I keep my mental health locked up and explode. I talk so much but nothing comes out of my mouth. The only thing that’s keeping me going is college. I just want to leave my school and family and start a new life with new friends. I can’t take it anymore I just wanna stop existing and cry all day. I don’t think there is a day I haven’t cried myself to sleep this month.

Anyways I just needed to vent. This was way less organized than my last one but these are just thoughts that kept popping into my head. And I need somewhere to put them. My last post helped me a lot and took a weight off my shoulders so I thought I would try again.",18Dec2020,2
57,"I never been diagnosed with anything or seen a specialist but I’m pretty confident I have anxiety, and spurts of depression (maybe more). I never talked to my family about it and don’t want my family paying for therapy since I’m in that weird ‘dependent/independent’ college age. 

My mom has ADHD and sleep issues and brothers have bipolar. My issues may be more intense cause I’m on birth control but I use to self harm when I was off it and had more depression than the current anxiety.

I have meltdowns in front of my boyfriend a lot and sometimes anxiety attacks (shortness of breath, fatigue, overwhelmed feeling of dread, and different stress related ‘tics’). Since I haven’t been diagnosed and he can’t understand how I’m feeling, he doesn’t know how to comfort me. I’m not quite sure how I need to be comforted to be honest. 
 
He always says things like: “try not to think about it””you should feel happy/grateful””why are you crying? You have no reason to cry”

But all of this makes me feel worse and hate myself for feel sad about something and just and overwhelm feeling of guilt which makes me more anxious and stressed. I’ve explained this to him but his responses are logical in his mind so it’s hard for him to understand and I don’t know what the other comfort I’d need in that situation.",18Dec2020,4
58,"Idk how many more days I can take cooped up in the house with no future in sight, stuck in isolation. This is the first time in my life I’ve genuinely considered killing myself as my best option. When I wake up every morning I get overwhelming feeling of frustration, angst, disappointment it’s hard to describe but it makes me feel like I’m drowning if that makes any sense. The way I cope with this feeling is excessively smoking marijuana and drinking which is a good way to temporarily make me feel better but everyday I choose to smoke and drink instead of working my way out of this situation is only making things worse. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is I honestly don’t see a way out of this situation. I’m 23 and still live with my parents. I’ve been going to school off and on throughout the years but was only going because I had a GI Bill. So school was free and I got a monthly amount of money while I was enrolled. I had no idea what I wanted to do, grew up in an enlisted military family, so that’s what I knew... and the majority of the careers I considered growing up were in the military. Exiting high school I had absolutely no idea about what college I wanted to go to or what to major in, all I knew is I should probably go because I have it for free. All other plans up until this point involved enlisting after high school which my parents strongly discouraged me from doing since I have the GI Bill. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here goes life mistake #1- I have the ability to go to any state school for free in the country and decide to go to a school 30 minutes away so I can bunk with my high school best friend who is also from a low income environment. Surprise surprise he drops out within the first month. No big deal, I can always transfer. Right?

&amp;#x200B;

Mistake #2 Then that same semester I meet this girl who also has the GI Bill. She’s in a similar situation of not knowing what she wants to go to school for. We enter a long term relationship which now gives me access to 2x the monthly payments of the gi Bill. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mistake #3 what happens when you have two kids who have no idea what they want to do thousands of dollars a month whether they show up to class or not? Quite a few semesters of full time enrollment without showing up to any class besides day 1 to remain on the roster. Now my transcript has a good 4 full semesters of literal all F’s and WF’s. Somehow I still have a gpa of 2.2

&amp;#x200B;

Inevitably we both fail out of school and I move back in with my parents. Me and the girlfriend broke up and I’m a 20 YO at his parents house extremely frustrated with my life. Moving back home separated me from all the friends I made at college and pretty much all my friends from high school enlisted because that was our best option. Now I’m at the lowest point of my life with no friends, no future, and no education... que the waking up every morning with an overwhelming feeling of drowning. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward until now I’m 23, I went to a local community college to get my grades up enough to get reinstated back into university but have the same problem I did when I was 19! I’m knee deep in an accounting degree but don’t really have a desire to be an accountant. I want to commission into the military to become a pilot. Which you can do with any degree and I actually found a way to do it though something called the PLC Program with the marines. Honestly idk if it’s even possible with all these failed classes on my transcript. It would depend on if they calculate GPA on their own terms or just take it straight off the official transcript (because my transcript replaces failed grades with repeated courses but still leaves the failing grade visible on the transcript. The grade replacement is just for GPA calculation). But I would need to raise my GPA above a 2.2 before I even go try to talk to an officer selection officer so I don’t seem like a joke to him.

&amp;#x200B;

Doing the PLC program is the only way I can see myself finishing school because I now only have 1 semester of GI Bill remaining but have a good 5 semesters of school left. Which at 23 fucking hurts to think about 5 more semesters. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is if I can’t make this PLC program work I really don’t know what else I can do to get out of this situation. I’ve worked so many retail and food service jobs in my life and fucking hate them so much. Plus the pay is so minuscule I don’t see how I’d ever be able to get out of my parents house. They refuse to co-sign for me and my credit is in the dumpster so I can’t even get approved to live anywhere besides on campus housing. When places started to shut down because of covid the restaurant I was closed and I started getting unemployment. The unemployment had a $600 a week boost and was way more than I have ever made at a job which is sad. 

&amp;#x200B;

For all of 2020 I haven’t been enrolled in school. I’ve been Getting unemployment for the past like 5-6 months and pretty much completely stuck in isolation. This has made me the saddest I have ever been in my life. I don’t have anyone to talk to about it and am scared to go to a therapist due to being disqualified for the military (A.K.A my only known route out of poverty). Smoking helps me cope with all of this but I know that’s doing nothing but causing a temporary solution for a permanent issue. I’m trying to not rely on any substances but waking up everyday and just trying to kill time until I’m tired enough to fall back asleep again is driving me insane. I’m in a pretty nice house but sometimes can feel like a prisoner in here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Idk if there is something wrong with me or what. I live in a filthy room with clothes all over the place but the house in general is super clean, and even has a cleaning lady that comes every week I just can’t bring myself to maintain cleanliness. My hygiene is out the window I often wear the same clothes everyday until I notice they start to smell and have pretty much the same mentality about showering. I live in isolation and can go weeks without calling, texting, or talking to anyone besides my parents whom I just run into around the house from time to time. I’ve had substance abuse problems for the last couple of years. I wasn’t always like this, going into college I would workout everyday, often shower twice a day, cared dramatically about how I looked (often referred to as metrosexual) and was known as outgoing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t even understand myself how I got quite this deep down the rabbit hole but I recognized all these behavioral issues and know that they aren’t normal, are the root of my problems, and need to be changed. So I don’t think I’m autistic or anything. But sometimes comments by my parents make me feel like I have a disability. Recently my dad told me “you should go to the doctor and see if you have anything wrong with you” another distinguished memory I have is once when I refused to cover my microwaved food with a paper plate because I claim they are a carcinogen my mother said in front of me “see I think he has something wrong with him, like mentally” what hurt the most is that statement implied they have had this conversation before. The worst of them all was when I overheard my mother say “I wish Robert was our son...well maybe I shouldn’t say that”. Robert is a family friend who’d similar in age and recently commissioned in the Air Force as a pilot. It drove me crazy hearing that. That one definitely made me feel expendable and fucked me up for a few months until I Drunkly addressed it to them, which they acted like she never said that... I at least appreciate the effort to not let me find out. She couldn’t even look me in the eyes for quite a few days after I told them I heard that. 

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah I’m pretty fuck in the head I guess n I have no one to sort this out with. Typing this out alone has slightly helped, I feel like a burden to the only 2 people left in my life. Like my existence at this point is selfish, I can only imagine having sex one day only to have a chronically depressed grown man in your house 23 years later with no way of getting rid of him on the foreseeable future. I know everything that has happened it completely my fault and I’m not even completely sure what the goal of posting this is. Does anyone have any sort of ideas on how to get out of his situation? I’ve recently looked into truck driving as an alternative to going back to university if the PLC program didn’t seem to work out for one reason or another. There is a company called Rohel that will pay for you to get your CDL the problem with that is the trucking life seems to lead to further isolation. I want a job where I can form a friend group and be happy again not be alone for the next 10 years. I’ve already lived a good year of it and can’t stand it. Nobody even told me happy birthday when I turned 23 which is not a big deal but it just goes to show nobody gives a fuck about me and I want to change that.",18Dec2020,1

We were in a relationship for around 6 years, and this is one of many attempts before and since. She's been in ICU for an overdose before, she's tried to jump in front of a train. She has bipolar so her mood changes in waves over months, and I know that this is going to happen again and again.

How do you deal with this kind of situation? She was only diagnosed last year, but she's stopped taking her meds multiple times. I want her to be safe but what do you say to someone like this? She told me that I can't watch her 24/7, and sure enough, 2hrs into my shift she tells me that she's sorry and it will be over soon.

65,"i am so broken. It started about 5 years ago when I was bullied pretty badly at school it got to a point where I couldn't even make myself go. I know it sounds stupid but id describe it as trauma maybe its not I've never got that part diagnosed because I've never been able to open up about it. My brain has put up a mental block so I can't really remember much I think that's just something normal the brain does but I'm not sure. Because of those events it led to me developing anxiety and depression. Because I couldn't make myself go to school I waited a year and eventually got a homeschool tutor. For over 4 years id cry randomly usually at night. I've tried a therapist but I just couldn't open up about anything. As the years passed I lost a lot of hope and now I just don't open up to anyone who knows me. As a person I just feel like everything about me is a defence mechanism sometimes ill notice something about me that I hate but I just can't change it. I am so incredibly lonely but whenever i try and make friends (this is one of those things I notice about myself that i don't like) i try to overcompensate because I'm so desperate for friends. I notice myself doing it but I still do it anyway. About 8 months ago I tried weed and for the first time since then I felt normal. I started using weed more and more and eventually it got to a point that id be high all the time just so I could feel free from all the stuff making me feel terrible. The problem now is that if I stop taking weed all i can think about is ending my own life. At the moment I'm out of weed and I don't know when it will next be delivered . I just feel so stuck and I often think about what would happen if i just stopped caring about my life and just smoked weed. At least then I can go in peace.

Literally debilitating.. the worst of it was being out of it so badly I didn't do anything for 3 days straight... thought I was coming out of it and ended up staying in bed from the moment I woke up officially in the morning till 4pm in the dark on my phone. I've had no desire to play my favorite video games, no desire to do the things I want for myself and I just want to see some sort of light at the end of the tunnel.. I want to keep going but I also feel like giving up.
I've been out of a job since March (got turned down by two jobs I interviewed for last week today both in and out of my ""field""),  my self esteem is worse than its been in years, my relationship is rough right now, and I'm lost. This is the longest I've ever gone without having some sort of structure to my day. When I was working it seemed to put a mask on what was broken.. but having to consistently look at myself everyday and see im not where I should be and I haven't done anything to achieve the dreams I've had is depressing. 
I think alot of it is just me feeling worthless and just straight up garbage. I feel lonely, I feel bad. Like this holiday is the first one ever where I wanted to take everything down because I wasn't feeling it. Im not even feeling affectionate.. 
I know Im depressed. I will speak to my psychiatrist next week.. (assuming I don't try and mask how I'm actually feeling) but its all so overwhelming right now I don't know what to do anymore.  I just never thought these feelings would comeback again so intensely.. 
Its just embarrassing i suppose because I tried so hard not to fall this far in again and here I am. The most I've been doing lately is just getting out of bed, going on my phone, and try to work on my personal goals if I have the energy to do it.  I just feel like I'm floating to nowhere..
I know this turned more into a vent than a question but any advice would be great. Thank you..",18Dec2020,4

69,"This year, actually these last two years, have been the worst years of my adult life so far. At the beginning of last year, I went through a horrible break of with my boyfriend of two years. I immediately jumped into an extremely toxic and emotionally/physically abusive relationship for the next ten months. Within the first few months he literally had me so suicidal that I drove my car into a tree. 9 months without a car I had to rely on him for all my transportation. End of last year my parents get divorced and my mom leaves for the holidays to spend them with her new boyfriend. My first year without seeing my step-dad’s family for the holidays.. he was a POS anyways so I didn’t necessarily care all that much. Anyway eventually I got out of that toxic relationship in January of this year. That same month my mom moves from here (Nebraska) to Florida to start her new life. It was hard but I had a great roommate, an amazing apartment which I only had to pay electricity and $450 in rent. I had a great support system and a really fun job. March 1st me and one of my long-time best friends go out to a bar (right before covid hit). She was supposed to come back home with me but we met another friend while we were there so she left with her. The next morning I wake up to a call that she’s dead in the hospital. I still blame myself. Then Covid hit... me and my roommate got into our first argument and she ended up moving out. She wouldn’t pay her half of the rent so I ended up getting evicted. Moved all my shit into storage and lived with my friend for a month trying to find a new place and a new roommate (which was difficult considering I have two cats). No where would accept me without a co-sign which I didn’t have. I had no choice but to sell all of my things that I loved, pack my car with only the things I could fit, grab my cats, and drive 21 hours across the country to live with my mom in Florida. I get there with a good amount of money saved up, I get two serving jobs and start to make some friends. I’m there for two months and everything for the most part is going well despite my mother’s alcoholism. She was gone half the time so it didn’t really affect me all too much. October 29th I wake up to her walking in the door telling me “we need to talk”. She tells me she’s going to go to rehab/treatment for her drinking. This means (with us living paycheck to paycheck) that Is have to move out and find somewhere else to live. Same day she packs up the apartment, I pack all my shit back up too, then I drive with my cats another 21 hours back to Nebraska. I’m now living in my grandparents unfinished basement, my cats aren’t allowed upstairs, I’m not allowed to get a job, I have no money, I rarely get to see my friends, and seasonal depression is hitting HARD. The weight of everything that has happened over these last two years is finally starting to crush me and I see no way out in sight. Excluding my cats and a handful of friends, I’ve lost most of the things I’ve truly cared about this year. My independence, my freedom, my confidence, my stability, I even chopped all of my hair off in a manic episode and it’ll take probably 5 years to get back to the length it was before. I’m defeated. I lay in bed and dissociate almost daily and when I do get out my anxiety is crippling. I feel like I have nothing to be happy about or to look forward to. The things I used to love all seem uninteresting. I guess I just want to understand why. Because I’m not a bad person. I’m actually a really good person. I’m highly empathetic and I understand sacrifice and I pour love into my friends and the people around me. I’ve done nothing (at least I think) to deserve being put in the position that I’m in. I’m usually a very optimistic person, I believe everything happens for a reason. My life has been very hard, my childhood was extremely traumatic. So why am I still being put through more trauma? Shouldn’t I be working my way up? Shouldn’t I be taking wins instead of losses? Anyway, I’m just here to vent because I hate to bother my friends and I don’t have any adult role models in my life.. hopefully things start looking up soon..",18Dec2020,0

72,"My ex girlfriend, who I broke up with about a month and a half ago, makes me feel incredibly anxious when I’m around her, and it started even before we broke up. The reason I decided to end the relationship was because of the anxiety, I don’t know what it was but I boiled it down to relationship anxiety, but it seemed much more than that. Every time I was around her I felt a pit in my stomach, and I was constantly worried about our relationship, though I never wanted to lose her. Now that we’ve been broken up and I haven’t been seeing her as much I don’t feel that anxiety much anymore. The thing is, I still care about her and am attracted to her, but whenever I see her I just get anxiety ridden, I think it started because I was scared she’d leave me when we were together, probably because of my own insecurities. Now that we’re done I don’t get why I am still this anxious when I see her, because at this point after talking a few times we’ve cleared the air and agreed that neither of us really need a relationship right now, so why am I still so anxious about her? The reason why I made this post was because I saw something she posted on social media with one of her friends and I got a pit in my stomach, I know it’s a long shot but maybe somebody can help me understand why I do this.",18Dec2020,3

74,"hi, it’s 2pm right now where i live and i just went through a crying session because i just felt so holed up and helpless. some days i just sit at the corner of my room even in the day and just cry. i’ve been feeling this way for so long, but only recently i’ve been letting loose more often and just cry everything out. 

i came here because i can’t tell any of my friends or family about my problems. i just don’t feel they are problems worthy enough to even be called a problem (if you get what i mean)...like, all these problems are personal problems like body image since young and a certain condition called trich (sorry but you can look it up if you don’t know because i’m too ashamed to describe it). the least i want to hear from them are politically correct answers that i can see just by googling how to boost self confidence. regarding trich, for me i feel it’s accelerated by stress... not to mention i lost a lot of hair due to finals season and am trying to grow it back now. i briefly brought up dyeing my hair to my sibling and he just laughed and said you’re dyeing it now? he didn’t say anything but i can just sense the underlying meaning that i have such a huge patch on my head why am i even thinking of dyeing it :( i exercise to get a better body and go through a tedious process of doing my hair (usually a simple ponytail to cover  up but i can’t let my hair down outside or anything) but it just hasn’t been cutting it enough and i just feel pathetic  all the time. regarding trich, i have tried methods like fidget tools and self discipline training but :( 

i’ve always been the kind of person to always prioritise how others think of me, and people often vent to me but i feel too ashamed and embarrassed to vent back. this occurs so much, that those people’s problems become my own and i just want to shut off for a while...even if i didn’t do anything wrong, if someone is unhappy with me it will stick with me for the longest time and it just makes me feel worse knowing there’s someone out there i didn’t manage to please. i know you can’t please everyone but my life has just been revolving around other people for so long my ownself is starting to break down and i don’t know how to cope.

You see regular posts of people posting their fun holidays, what an ideal concept of a day is, eating fancy things see how they are having a seemingly 'perfect' boyfriend/girlfriend travelling the world together. Or those with a loving-family mom dad and children co-existing in peace.

86,"Hello everyone,

I would like to tell you a story that happened to me on (December 19-22 2018). I am currently in the psychiatric hospital in Tübingen being treated for acute psychosis. Basically I feared that people were out to ""get me"" that I was being ""watched"" and I kept having these bad dreams that I was still stuck in the Moscow SVO Airport of terminal D and was still refused professional medical help, access to local law enforcement and being denied basic information and basically being blocked from the truth at every turn.

I was trapped in the Moscow SVO airport from December 19- 22 after missing my connecting flight back to Stuttgart after being denied entry to Israel after being accused of attempting to make an illegal immigration by the Israeli border control. (But that is another story)

The main story is that once I arrived back at the Moscow SVO airport being run by Aeroflot, I was feeling rather lousy and had wanted to die. Considering that the 22nd of December was the anniversary of my father's death, I saw it as an opportune time to kill myself or allow myself to be killed which was somehow what I believed to be in the cards.

After presenting my case of how ""lousy"" I felt to the information desk at Terminal D in the Moscow Airport, they instructed me to take a seat next to them and they would call a medic. When the medic came, neither of which could speak English administered me a cotton swab with ether and a pill of some sort to possibly calm my nerves since I wanted to die. I took the white round pill about the size of a nickel and and I rested my head over my hands by the desk at the information desk. After some time of coming to, I made my way to the gate where I fell asleep and woke up just in time for my flight or so I thought.

When I awoke I rushed to the desk of the gate and stated that I was there for the flight and was it still there.

They had informed me at approximately at 9:30am December 20th that it had in fact left without me and that they made it a distinct point to express verbally in English that it was my fault.

Without a functioning credit card and only 50 euros in my wallet I made my way through the airport corridors of the massive terminal D of Moscow airport SVO. Lost and alone I went from restaurant to restaurant, to shop from shop looking for assistance of any kind. All of which had unanimously referred me to go to the information desk of Terminal D and ask for assistance.

This whole thing seemed to be as some sort of Kafkaesque nightmare. After seeing that I was not the only person having this problem I decided that after 24hours living in the airport of Moscow SVO terminal D, I would eventually turn myself in to the border control of the airport and have my self deported for overstaying my allotted time in the airport. The difficulty was that I could barely speak Russian and I only knew a few words from what I remembered from my time with my ex-wife who was of pure Russian descent and had family still in Russia, hence being there in the holidays because I truly missed them.

I also had to find where the 'exit' to the border control was and how to get there.

With the help of an anonymous source I was able to have someone translate in Russian my situation. They recommended that I go to the border control. The problem was, the border control was just an exit with no proper entrance so I had to take my google translator on my phone and show it to the immigration officer after so many people had passed and there would be space for me to quickly show the screen of my mobile phone.

I eventually got through and they brought me through the one way exit on the top floor and then proceeded to go through the X Ray machine again but this time from the rear, basically backwards from where the other passengers were entering. After passing control I was led to a large room where passports and entry was being controlled for Russian Nationals only. I was seated and told to wait. For how long I did not know and I was very tired, hungry, thirsty and I needed to use the bathroom quite urgently. I was eventually allowed to use the bathroom after using the Google translator on my phone to express this urgent request. I was taken to a bathroom around the corner which was closed for repairs, I was instructed to use it although the floor was completely covered in what appeared to be human urine. It was the same in the handicapped bathroom nextdoor, so I put my 2 hand bags up in the sink to avoid touching the urine covered floor.

After relieving myself, I made my way back to where the Russian Nationals were passing border control. There was no sound and no music in the air, the mood was completely dead and there were drawings of cartoon animals on the walls of the booths in which the officers were working, sometimes doubling up on duties in the airport but nonetheless working together.

So I waited and I whined. I continued to use my google translator to try to get through to the guards and try to figure out what was actually going on there and what was holding everything up. Eventually like a hostage I took my phone and pressed it up to the window of one of the border control officers and tried to present my case with the phone translator. After making some painful and worried exaggerated expressions with my face he motioned to me to hand him my phone and he typed what the issue was, ""solve the problem"" it said. So at this point I realized I might actually be in serious trouble if I don't have a valid reason for being in the airport. So I decided to come clean and tell them that I was sad and lost and I missed my in-laws who lived in Russia.

I was eventually accepted and after about another hour of waiting I was finally invited into the office/ room to talk with them about my case and how to get me out of there. There was one woman who was trying to gather information and asked me where I went to school, I said SUNY Purchase, not knowing if she had ever heard of a liberal arts college before and proceeded to hand her some ID cards for her to copy as communication in English seemed out of the question. After this brief round of questioning and I was allowed in the room they had prepared some pages of what appeared to be a contract or a release form in Russian, approximately 7-10 pages at least although entirely in Russian. Being the student that I was I respectfully declined to sign the release of information due to the simple fact that I do not understand what I would be signing and could not do so in good faith. The gentleman who tried to explain the case in English understood and said it was ok, but the curly haired mid 30's blonde woman who was asking me questions about where I went to school, was clearly dismayed. I was handed a fine for 2,000 rubles which was prepared and I was sent back out of the room with a new boarding pass back to Stuttgart from Moscow to be at gate 6 at 8:50am the next morning and a credit voucher for 1,000 to buy anything I wanted from the stores or cafes in the airport.

Thankfully and graciously I exited the office of the border control and I made my way back to the neutral zone of the terminal once again, but not before going through airport security one more time and this time they were clearly exasperated and not very helpful or friendly with me, not that they had been up till then. I was ridiculed and made fun of by the controlling officers by the x Ray machine and I simply took the abuse politely and walked on. In this time I took advantage of the fact that there were many hours to go to my flight so I walked around the airport to see if there were in fact any other flight options other than Aeroflot. Apparently there were not so I found a nice 'comfortable' seat and I slept with one eye open.

There is still quite a bit more to the story, but I figured I would start there in telling you the details.

I hope you will find interest in the story as it is one that deals with the denial of basic human rights, denial of information and care and basic negligence and manipulation on the part of the airline and greater portion, the airport itself.

I hope this story finds you well.

Best wishes and a happy holiday.

87,"This is all public news now.  Initially we (friends) didn't share any information with anyone.  However time has passed and the family is public about what happened in hopes to raise awareness for mental health.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago I had lunch with my friend Amberley.  She told me she is moving back home to Arcata (California) to help her brother.  Jacob was diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenia four years prior and things had gotten very bad.  Her older brother Aaron moved back to help as well.  Along with the youngest brother Luke and their mom Beverley they tried help Jacob.  They called for weeks to the local health authorities, the police, and anyone they could find.

Jacob had locked himself in his room for months rarely coming out.  I saw the room after all the trash, feces, and carpet had been removed.  The walls had not been touched yet.  Jacob had put red vinyl tape every foot running up the walls.  Between the lines of red tape were drawings on paper that contained Hebrew and Japanese characters.  There were dozens of them.  It was very clear that whoever lived there needed help.  Amberley said she wanted me to see it, she wanted me to believe her, that her brother was not well.  It saddened me and angered me how their cries for help were ignored.

After being bounced back between the police and local health officials they finally said they would come for a home visit in a week.  Unfortunately a few days later Jacob had an episode.  Amberley, Aaron, and Aaron's girlfriend were playing cards in the kitchen.  Jacob was screaming for them to leave and get out of the apartment.  Amberley said fine they'd leave after the game is over.  She had gone to use the bathroom and while she was washing her hands she heard a struggle outside.  Jacob had ran out of his room into the kitchen.  Amberley comes out to see all three of them wrestling then Jacob gets up and runs back into his room.  Aaron had been stabbed in the heart.  She held him as he died in her arms.

I'm posting this because I love and care about my friend.  As well that this tragedy could have been prevented.  The family knows it and anyone who knows the story knows it.  Right now they're fighting for Jacob as he sits in jail being charged for the murder of his own brother.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the family's story about what happened.  How the city acknowledged and recognized Jacob needed help but did nothing.

89,"I’ll try to make this post quick. Trigger warning for CSA. Please don’t read if you’re not in a good space to read about sexual abuse at the moment.

I have CPTSD from CSA at the hands of family member’s previous romantic partner. Took a work leave due to severe dissociative episodes relating to said trauma, on medication, have been doing trauma therapy for 3.5 years. Now finally back at work, doing better.

Today, I was doing the dishes and randomly remembered this memory that I’ve always had but never thought much about. It was completely separate from the above issue of abuse. 

Memory: I’m in my mom’s apartment sleeping on a couch. It’s morning time and two, slightly older but still very much young, boys (I am female) who were family friends had come over. One was maybe seven years old and one was maybe ten years old. I was about six. I woke up and my leg was kind of perched on the top of the couch (I’m a weird sleeper, admittedly) but my underwear wasn’t on and they were looking at my parts and kind of awkwardly giggling. I felt so humiliated. That’s it. That’s the whole memory. 

I’ve always had this memory with me, and for some reason, it just never struck me as odd. But I wondered today, like, why wasn’t I wearing underwear? Where was my mom? If we were having guests over, why didn’t someone wake me up or cover me up? Maybe those family friends slept over and I’m misremembering, but even still — why did someone let me sleep with no underwear, as a little girl, with two slightly older boys? In fact, why was my underwear off at all, given that we lived with my mom’s boyfriend at the time as well? All weird things.

Anyway, my question is: now what? Do I message those (now adult) kids and ask them if they remember and what happened? We were great childhood buddies for many years after this, and are still on good distant terms. Do I just move on and try not to think about this? 

Thank you.",18Dec2020,1
90,"I have a bestfriend. Sometimes, she will ask to hangout and I would go with her because I feel energized to do so, other times I refuse to go because my depression and anxiety has gotten the best of me. Then she would get mad or sad about it and I begin to feel bad. And start to question myself, “am I just making up excuses to not go out?” And I tell myself “I am selfish” for putting myself before her.

It’s not that I don’t like hanging out with her, it’s just that every-time I do, She constantly remind me of my unworthiness, my flaws, and my mistakes. When I tell her “I don’t want to go out because I feel mentally exhausted”  she downplays it and says “excuses, excuses” 

I love her dearly, she is a good person with a good heart. However, she has played a good amount of part in looking down on me. I noticed this but I never wanted to call her out on it because then I would become a bad friend. When I tell her I want to pursue something she subtly tells me, I won’t be able to do it and laughs at it like I’m joking and that success for me is unreachable. I told her I haven’t showered in a week and she called me lazy, even though I told her it’s because I’m not feeling mentally well right now, she says I’m making excuses. This is the same with my family. 

She wonders why I never open up to her and well this is the reason. I open up to some people and they never take it serious. Now I can’t help it but keep everything inside because I fear that my feelings, thoughts, and opinions are actually just an “excuse” like they say it is. 

Am I selfish for thinking this way? Should I have just gone with her despite the lack of motivation or energy? Because maybe she’s also feeling under the weather and needs some company. 

I realize my friendship in a way is toxic, but I reduce to believe it because I know she cares about me...at least I believe so. I just need a confirmation from an outsider point of view. Am I selfish?",18Dec2020,1
91,"I’ve been thinking about taking a 1-2 week trip to a mental health hospital to help calm my emotions, which have been at an all time high. 

On Dec 10, I got into a car accident. I broke my jaw and crushed my left femur and left humerus. I’ve had surgery already for my femur and humerus but they’re searching for someone to fix my jaw. 

I’m still inpatient at the hospital so I’m not thinking about going right now, but my orthopedic surgeon said I can’t put weight on my leg or arm for 6 weeks **at least**. 

Would I still be able to go to a crisis center or shorter term inpatient hospital and continue to receive the physical treatment I need on top of giving me the mental health help? 

I can’t just get a therapist because my car was totaled in the accident and I can’t work so I have no idea when I’ll be able to buy another car. Plus, I’ve been at my wits end mentally for a couple of weeks and I feel like this car accident is pushing me over the edge. 

For what it’s worth, I have no memory starting from about an hour before the accident until the day after (Dec 11).

The issue is I have recovered professionally but not personally. I struggle with random bouts of anxiety and intense fear. My mind wanders to suicide once a day but I don't want that. I want to be here. My mental breakdown put us behind financially and I'm finally working my way out of that hole. I don't want to alarm my Wife or children. I have attacks where I sit in my car trying to catch my breath, trying to to stop from crying, trying to push out bad thoughts.

Is there any hope I can recover to be me again? Is there reccomended therapy? I live in fear my mind will break again and I feel like my anxiety over it will make that fear a self fulfilling prophecy.

I've learned to act like who I used to be but I have lost complete control of my mind. I just want to be me again. If anyone can help me, please.",18Dec2020,0
93,"Just for some background, I have bipolar 2 and I’ve been treating it with medication since February 2020. 
I’m  riding the chemical roller coaster right now and I’m becoming undone. 
I’ve come to terms today that I am simply not taking care of myself, my number one concern being what I eat..or don’t.
With bipolar some days are good some days are bad. But it’s gotten to where damn near everyday is awful. 
I want to set some sort of plan or goal for myself. My biggest struggle is with a lack of appetite, sometimes just thinking of food makes me sick to my stomach. And I usually wait until I’m ravenous, to eat something. I skip breakfast and lunch on most days and then eat some sort of snack and dinner.

Do you have any suggestions on baby steps I can put into action?",18Dec2020,1
94,"I'm finally going to get some help/advice. This Sunday,  there will be a saa meeting. I'm looking forward to it, but im also nervous. As a younger person,  I don't know how awkward it might be. Anyways,  that's not a big deal. I've come here

2. What is a group meeting setting like (doesn't have to be saa related, but preferred)",18Dec2020,1
95,"Most days now I keep thinking of worst scenarios. 
Not much about whether I'll get the job or I have to socialise with new people (i can be very outgoing) but the overwhelming thoughts regarding the safety and wellbeing of myself and my family. 

Triggers:

-just going into the city

-driving in heavy traffic with aggressive drivers
 
-crowds in public (especially city crowd)

-crowded trains or odd looking people on trains

-dodgy looking people in public

-recent passings of people

-any media content that talks about sad/scary things that have happened to people

I don't really want to elaborate as to why these trigger me because once again, i'm scared of saying things out loud or have them 'materialize' just in case...you know...
The thing is though, I try to always brush off the initial triggered thought - but then everytime the thought just ends up consuming me to a point where I need to get home ASAP to stop being on edge and seeing everything as a threat. I also do silly things like.
for example:
- I've gotten off trains before and had to wait for the next one and

-I avoid certain words or conversations 

-Check locks/look out window constantly 

Heck I'm even struggling to send this as it's an inner battle to say it will be alright to send this. 

So I think this is catastrophized thinking or is this anxiety or just being paranoid?

This has occurred a few times before and both times I haven't known what was happening.

Usually accompanied with anxiety or panic, I would become extremely scared that if I were to walk out of the current room I was in, I would either open the door to an endless void, or that I would step onto a movie set, and everything I had known would've been fake, like some Truman show kinda deal.

99,"So, over the past year and a half I have noticed myself developing OCD like tendencies as I panic about leaving the house and making sure my parents house or my apartment is locked up anytime I leave. It makes me double and triple check things as I fear the thought of a break in or my dog getting out and getting hurt. I also am scared that something might burn down or some disaster is going to happen while I’m away? The fear has gotten to the point where I become super tense and can’t stop thinking about it I locked all of the doors or not when I drive away and I usually turn around to double check, making me late to things.

During COVID, my anxiety has gotten even worse as I moved to a new town for grad school and I live alone and feel constantly isolated. Even when I wasn’t at home I would have panic attacks about going out to places or being around others in a crowded setting (such as a store). I really noticed something was wrong today as I headed back home from Grad School for the holidays and after my car was loaded, I stood in my tiny 400 square foot apartment, shaking crying and feeling like I was missing something. I literally stood there and walking in circles for about 45 minutes making me late on the time I was planning to be home. 

I don’t know what to do next. How do I approach my general practitioner? Do I go to them first? Can someone help me script what to say? I know I want to go back on my anxiety meds (fluoxetine) that I haven’t taken in 3 years as I have been coping but I don’t know when I can get into the office next when I am in town. Can I just call and ask if I can get prescribed it while I’m waiting to get in to the doctor? 

Also, I have an old therapist (not sure if she was a therapist or psychologist??) but I haven’t gone to here in probably 4 or 5 years and I didn’t like her as she was the one I had as a child and she makes me feel like a child when visiting.

100,I’m not really suicidal. I just don’t see myself going on and tire life time like this,18Dec2020,2
101,"I don't think it's depression/anhedonia because it's not like I lose interest in everything all at once. But when I start a new relationship or pick up a new hobby, it's like I want to do it all the time and then I hit a wall and I'm just completely disinterested, to the point that forcing myself to do it anyway becomes excruciating. With songs I like, I'm sure it's because I listen to them too many times and get tired of them. Most of it is fine -- I don't have to retain every hobby I pick up -- but with people it's more frustrating/painful. It's really hard to explain to a close friend why I'm suddenly avoiding them, because it's really nothing they did. I just get to the point with people that I've kind of ""figured them out"" so to speak -- I can predict how they'll act in any given situation, I can finish half of their sentences, and talking with/spending time with them begins to feel boring and repetitive. Their interesting quirks become grating and even supporting them with mental health issues feels pointless because it's clear to me that it doesn't make any difference outside of the given moment -- nothing ever actually changes -- and I start to feel like sisyphus.

Plus I'm seriously introverted. And I get these bursts of energy where that doesn't matter when I'm getting close to someone I haven't figured out yet, but that wears off once they become predictable, and it's really hard to explain to someone why I'm no longer able to give them 70% of my free time and want to maybe shift that to like 2-5%.

It's happening with my current best friend and it's so tempting to look for other explanations -- he has anger issues and he's very sensitive; he's filed away some problematic behaviors as his ""coping mechanisms"" for some of the shit he's dealing with and that makes them untouchable, so it's stressful to be around him, especially around other people, because our status as friends makes it feel like I'm co-signing some of the shitty stuff he says/does. 

But I find it grating to be around him even when no one else is around and I know, I *know* this is the same pattern kicking in with my brain again where everything I get invested in just slips away from me. I don't even know if I want to be around him at all anymore. Meanwhile dude has abandonment issues and keeps making comments about how he's nervous about me getting a girlfriend because he might ""lose me again"" (because I won't spend as much time with him), or he's ""glad I'm back"" from being busy with finals. And it seriously isn't helping. I want to tell him to back off but I don't know. Dude's my roommate, he can't exactly fuck off. 

He wants to live together again next year and I know I can't do that. But I don't know how to handle shit in the meantime. And I don't know why this happens with everyone I ever care about. All I know is I should probably live alone from now on if I can afford it.",18Dec2020,1

I don't think I'm the only one who deals with mental issues, fully supports those around me and their mental health, yet still have unresolved difficult feelings about mental illnesses.

So one day I had an idea. Maybe we are fearful of mental illnesses (fear is the real face of discrimination, I believe) because how it is related to identity. Maybe this idea is not new at all, but I still want to try bring it up and describing it. 

Even if the illness itself is not related to identity (unlike, for instance, Dissociative Identity Disorder), it is still likely to affect the sense of identity. Like, people who have been depressed for a long time may say they don't remember who they are without depression. Like, delusions affect our outlook of life and the world.

So if our sense of identity builds on our subjective feelings, our perception and cognition and reaction, our beliefs and so on, and mental illnesses alter these things... Maybe we are fearful of mental illnesses because we fear losing identity? Not knowing who we are anymore? Maybe subconsciously we still feel that mental illnesses are some kind of ""possession""?

(Please note that I am not saying we should fear mental illnesses and those who have them. I just want to explore the possibilities of these feelings.)",18Dec2020,5

Hello, I have a serious anxiety problem that I have not seen in the literature and therefore cannot solve. Here's the problem. Imagine going to the hospital, you went without an appointment. You enter from the reception and wait in the waiting room. Suddenly the receptionist comes and says our doctor will come 8 hours later and you have to wait 8 hours here, in that chair. You don't have a phone either. Imagine how boring, how challenging, how overwhelming it is to wait for a doctor for 8 hours in a chair. Your mind will count every second. Now imagine that you have this experience every weekday, that is, you go to the hospital every weekday and you are waiting for a doctor in a chair for 8 hours and imagine what horror that will create from Sunday.

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is that I  experience this waiting psychology anytime and anywhere. 1.5 years ago, 3 weeks after my girlfriend committed suicide, I started a job I had previously contracted and it was a consulting job, the Mckinsey style was extremely intense, the expectation was too big on me, and I was a hard-standing person using five psychological drugs. 7-8 hours before work, suddenly the thought that there is more to the end of my work, you are here at least 7-8 hours has passed in my mind. I looked at the computer clock and suddenly my mind started looking at the clock on the computer every 10 seconds. I turned off the clock. This time my mind started counting the seconds constantly and I felt stuck there for 7-8 hours. I was trying to do business but I couldn't focus, I felt stuck, I was like I was in the waiting room without doing anything for 7-8 hours, I had a panic attack.

&amp;#x200B;

I had to quit the job, but this anxiety happened even in my daily life, I was waking up in the morning and I was worried about how it would pass today, because my mind counted seconds, I could not even watch movies or TV series because I couldn't focus.

&amp;#x200B;

After 1.5 years, I re-enter work for a different company and in a different position, but I'm afraid that I will pass this anxiety and go crazy. What should I do? I did intensive reading and exercises on both CBT and ACT, you can suggest from these areas, I am also open to other suggestions.

109,"I've tried to say this multiple times in multiple different ways but I'm not doing a great job at it so I'm just gonna leave this here. I'm not gonna complain about my depression, thoughts of suicide, people in general, or anything else really for that matter. Okay, there might be a little bit of complaining but I just wanna say that since the second I woke up to now at the end of the day there has not been a second in which I wasn't thinking about suicide. Whether it was how, or why, or even just thinking about the morals of suicide within itself no matter what it was, it was about suicide. Sure I didn't tell anyone or discuss it with another person and I could talk about whatever with anyone today but no matter the conversation we were having the thought of suicide was on the back of my mind.

If you're wondering why keep reading, I won't get into detail because there's too much to say if I were too and that would take too long and well... the post would get too long as well I suppose.                                                                         Basically I have no friends and my family doesn't support me. There's a thousand other things that definitely add onto the pain but those are the main ones I'll talk about in this post. I live in a conservative state but I'm not conservative. I'm a bisexual atheist to say the least and I'm not really liked here. It's common practice for someone to say something to the degree of ""f\*gs should be killed"" so living here hasn't been the best. Even with that not in mind, the people who are more open-minded per se often times I don't fit in with either for whatever reason. More often than not when someone says they have no friends they still do to some degree. They just don't have CLOSE friends. I on the other hand, don't have friends. To put it in the most basic/simplest terms I possibly could, if I left my phone alone for a month or two I would not have one missed call or one text message. And I know this because I don't get texts or calls from anyone now when I do have my phone.

I talk to people, sure... But there's never a connection. There's never a ""lets hangout sometime"" moment for me and another person it just is a normal conversation until it gets awkward and we both leave unsatisfied with that interaction because it got awkward in the end. I don't think I'm a weird person, sure I'm different and I do have some mental disorders but the worst disorder I have would be OCD or  PTSD but even then my PTSD doesn't often show up so I'm usually good.  Hopefully I can't make friends because I'm just different from my town or state but I'm not entirely sure. As far as my family not supporting me, my dad walked out when I was 3 and sure I see him once a year or so during a holiday but that's because he doesn't wanna feel like he totally abandoned me and my sisters but he did. We barely saw him growing up and barely see or hear from him now. When we do see him he's insulting my mom or trying to push religion on me so that's fun.

My grandparents (on my mom's side, I've only met my dad's parents twice) disowned me... Well, they called me a communist, said if I was their son they'd kick me out and that they would disown me but then they banned me from ever coming to their house again and I literally haven't been there since. Btw, I was called a ""communist"" because I said if you don't wanna pledge allegiance to the flag you shouldn't have to and that it isn't really a big deal as to whether or not someone does it. Because of that, my cousin said if I hate it here so much why don't I just move to china.

Again, there's way more that I could talk about and explain but in this post I just wanted to say that it's been a rough day. I almost pulled over on the side of the road to walk up the bridge I had passed to jump off it. And while sitting in my car today I had thought about just being in my garage with the door down and just letting my car run because that's gotta be a less painful way to die than to shoot yourself or even take pills, right? I'm not looking to be saved, I'm not even looking for a friend anymore. I just wanted to tell someone how I was feeling because I don't get to do that right now with the people I know. Also, I'm sure there's a bunch of typos and spelling errors and to that I say... I don't care the post is readable enough. Anyways thanks for reading, if you wanna chat I'm always down and if you have any questions or whatever I'll probably answer them. At this point in my life I'm damn near an open book because why the fuck not",18Dec2020,1

She was certainly not emotionally or slowly capable of raising a child, she was 18 by then.  four years later I was born in an unplanned conception, she did not want to give birth to me and declares it without any remorse, she had what her father would say, so she decided to give me a purpose as an investment to ensure that from my  future would live comfortably.  She never saw me as a son, but as an investment.  She raised me and my brother with fear and her pity for herself, when the fear stopped affecting us because she no longer had anything to extort us, she resorted to self-pity, declaring her suffering for raising us, this worsened when my father was on the edge  from his controlling and manipulative behavior, he abandoned me and my brother ... without a doubt I paid more for my father's selfish act.

At this point she is at the limit that she can still consider her as my mother, she swore that she would pass the same fate as the dog, if she does something to him.

But so as not to be overcome by despair in the recognition that no easy escape remains, we should remember that a neurosis offers us the chance to discover a path in life that is far more fulfilling than the one we currently tread. In fact, recovering from a neurosis can result in a level of psychological health, and a degree of resilience, not found in those who never endure such suffering. A neurosis, in other words, is only a curse if we remain forever caught in it, but will prove a blessing if we can find an escape. ",18Dec2020,1
118,"I've been trying to reach out more and get more help for my mental health instead of trying to handle it alone and feeling like I'm just running into walls. My work support keeps ditching our meetings becuase despite supposedly being trained to help those with mental health issues she is obviously not comfortable with those kinds of problems. She only wanted to do anything if I needed physical accommodations. But what has kind of kicked the wheels out from me lately is what happened this week.


I got a mental health screening per request of the walk in clinic I go to becuase they wanted to see if they could prescribe me drugs and I had said I really need a trained specialist to determine that instead of guessing on my own. I have diagnosis of ADHD and ASD from other doctors in the past and the last therapist I have seen this year have tossed around cPTSD but didn't commit to the diagnosis since they only saw me a total of 11 hours over ten weeks. Monday was the first part of the screening and seemed to go well, talked about maybe a third of what I have been dealing with and usually deal with and some coping things I do. Since the time ran over she said she wanted another appointment to talk about my PTSD and wanting to get that on paper as a diagnosis.  Seems great right?


Come Tuesday and suddenly she wants to toss my other diagnosis out becuase from her own words she doesn't know much about them and just label me with  borderline personality disorder. I'm completely confused at this, wanting to talk about the rest of what I deal with becuase that's what I thought this was for. I kind of push back against what she is claiming, since she isn't being specific and just keeps saying I fit some of the requirements but she isn't saying which ones and she is obviously irritated at me not agreeing with her. She doesn't want to continue unless I agree to be labeled as BPD and cuts things short. I ask about getting a copy of the letter she is making and she just says I will have to request it specifically from the health records and that's where the call ends.


Turns out she withheld all the information I need to actually request the letter from my records, I have no idea what she has amended to my records, when it is getting attached and if she has just made getting help harder by claiming I am lying about ADHD and ASD because she feels I have BPD after only talking to me for an hour.  I've just been feeling horrible over this becuase it feels like I've been reaching out for help only to get smacked for it again and again. What's worse is this is making it so much harder for me to keep trying to get help even when I know I need it. I just felt I had to push back since BPD hasn't been what other people I have talked to have even brought up and even wasn't something she had been considering 24 hours earlier but I keep worrying over it now if she put it in there anyways becuase I pushed back against it.",18Dec2020,1
119," I need help for my friend.

She is 21, dealt with issues since childhood, such as : extreme poverty, health issues, having parents with toxic relationship, often witnessed them arguing and fighting.

lately her family got out of financial crisis, though a little bit, and she somehow managed to get into college.

She doesn’t speak of any other problem, kind of a person who encapsulate feelings, But 1 : According to her, she faces very difficulty when it comes to read or write. Seems weird? Hold on let me explain!

According to her, it started when she got into high school and then began escalating.

&gt;“The moment i think of reading or writing, i start to panic and get anxious, it does sound a lot like ‘laziness’ but its even to the things i love studying about, first i took it as overthinking and shrug it off but its getting on my nerves lately"" -States her

She says that even the most lovable things like reading lyrics of a song or googling things, she suffers the same.

According to her, she does show evident signs of OCD &amp; ADD but its not diagnosed by a psychiatrist yet, as she can’t afford one. The country that she lives in is amoral enough to not provide mental health services so easily to citizens.

I tried to keep the post short so people don’t get too worn out by its glance and read it at least,  
I know i might be missing out on few points here, if you have any questions regarding her, ask me, i will share.  
If anyone got any clue about it, please help us,  
Specially if you are a mental health expert,  
Any opinions are welcomed!",18Dec2020,1
120,"I'd like to preface this with the fact that I have an eating disorder sooo that probably doesn't help, and warning about that sorta talk

As the title states, hate my body a whole lot. Since my entire life has been canceled due to a pandemic, it's gotten much worse. Not being forced to go outside has just made it so I don't want anyone to see me ever. All my new friends from school (it's my first year of uni) have been talking to me online and I've so scared for them to see me and what I actually look like. I feel so disgusting and horrible every day, and have even become accustomed to covering up the mirror in my bedroom with a blanket so I don't have to look at myself. I've been talking to a guy from my uni online and I definitely like him, and he says he likes me. The issue us he hasnt seen my body and it's certainly not good. I know that once he does it's all gonna be over, and I've started getting really depressed most nights. 

I got diagnosed with an ED fairly recently, so it all just sorta feels like too much. Since I got the diagnosis and  everyone in my life found out I just feel so much more trapped  like they're all looking at me differently, and probably thinking I'm too fat to have an eating disorder, etc etc. I honestly think they would all think I was ugly if we werent already friends. Maybe they just keep me around so they feel more attractive. I always get so tempted to just push everyone away and let them be better off without me, but every time I get sad like this I wake up the next morning and push it all back down again. Everyone around me just thinks I'm so good with my emotions (even though I'm sensitive), and I'm so good at dealing with hard times like this, but really I just put it all back in and never tell anyone about any of it.

No one knows that I feel this way, and when I have a really bad ED day and just feel disgusting and horrible and can barely look down at my body without crying I just ignore everyones messages until I can get the strength to push it all down again. I don't know what to do anymore.

When I was younger I wanted to study political science, I got accepted started and then realized I actually hated it and started ditching class and failed the first year. My mother decided to switch me to Business “because it was easier” (she was paying) and I did (miraculously) pass after but It also wasn’t for me.

I have always liked the arts but never felt I was good enough to be in art school and be around others who were naturally talented even though it’s something I like. I am also worried that how I’m feeling maybe influenced by my ex who was an artist and that makes me feel like I have no identity really. I’m a nobody, who the hell am I and what do I want?

124,"For context I have severe depression (among other things) and its been awhile since I've consistently taken my medication.

I've been depressed for quite sometime now, but its recently gotten worse with constant thoughts of suicide. The reason I didn't open up to my family about it is because everytime I try I end up feeling worse. I know they mean well and genuinely want to help, but everytime I feel like I'm wasting my breath.

Yesterday I was talking to my sister about how I've been feeling for the past few months, and I don't remember much of what she said but she did say something along the lines of ""well what did you do to better yourself during that time?"" After that I didn't even know what to think. I always get told about myself; what I've done in during fights between me and my family, that I take things to a 10, that I need to control myself, that I twist words so I'm the victim, that I hate my family because I don't open up to them, etc. I know I'm not perfect, I do and say things that I shouldn't, but in the end I always feel like everything was my fault. Even right now I can't tell if I skewing the story in my favor.

So, what was my response to talking with my sister? To try and take a handful of muscle relaxers. Me and my sister start fighting over the pills, while my sister's boyfriend is yelling at me in the background making me feel worse, eventually the police, firefighters, paramedics, and my parents arrive. The authorities try to talk to me but its going out one ear. In the end I leave with my parents. 

I don't know what to do/ what my problem is. I've been crying for days, nothing is helping me feel any better, and my suicidal ideation has only gotten worse. There is so much more I want to say I just don't know how. I'm just tired.

127,"Hey all. I’ll try to keep this as brief and to the point as I can.  My dad lost his battle with bi polar disorder when I was 9, and that’s haunted me ever since (his last words to me were “see you when you get back”, I was going on a trip. Fucker lied to me). I have a wonderful stepdad and grandfather, but I feel like I’m just another stepson to my stepdad (im not his first stepson and when he talks about him he had a dismissive tone, like “he’s not one of my kids, he’s my step kid”), and my grandfather and I have only been building a real relationship the last few years. Combine this and the fact that my dads dad (who I absolutely loved when I was little, but after my grandma died he remarried and left pretty much the whole family behind) seems to not want me in his life, and you could say I have serious father issues.

Also, since I live with my grandparents and my mom/stepdad live close by, I’m the middle ground when they vent about each other and I hear things about both houses that I don’t need to know. I seem to be the only one they can turn to so I don’t feel comfortable asking them to stop, especially since I did before and nothing happened.

As time has gone on and I’ve learned more, I discover that more and more of my behavior falls under the autism spectrum. But when I brought up to my family that maybe getting tested might be a good idea so I know how I can manage these behaviors that have made my life a living hell, they said that they’ve known for years but don’t want me to get tested because it “marks you” and can ruin your life, and we can’t really trust tests like that because they’re subjective.

So, combine these with depression and anxiety, and I have many good reasons to go to therapy. I have in the past, and ever since the last therapist gaslit me and manipulated me, therapy has been given a bad name in my family and whenever I bring up the possibility they bring that back up.

Now, normally I would turn to friends to vent and ask for help/support from, but I also have pretty much no one! Most of my friends and I drifted apart, and the few have left are either going through stuff themselves or I don’t want to stress them out with my stuff (I have a girlfriend who’s my best friend of 10 years, but I don’t want to turn to her with some of this because I don’t want to risk changing how she sees me).

130,"Roughly 6 months ago I totaled my car and almost killed my best friend at the time. He was put in the hospital for a day or two and I got out with a very minor concussion  and a few small burns from the airbags. I was rarely getting updates from him or his girlfriend at the time. I was already in a bad place and if he died in the hospital I knew that it would push me over the edge and I would have committed suacide. He survived obviously, but he moved away a few moths later. And now that he's gone it feels like all of my old friends that I've known for years have faded away and it's out of my control. Like my other best friend that I've known since 4th grade rarely wants to hang out and do shit, yet alone talk. Everyone has slowly turned themselves into acquaintances. Nobody ever hits me up saying they want to chill anymore, I always have to make the plans and tbh im just tired of it. And I'm always left behind when they make plans. But then everyone sends me a very unauthentic ""are you ok?"" whenever they see me solo drinking. I only drink every once in a while, and Ive heard that shit too many times to care about responding anymore. 

My past trama
My dad tried to kill himself when we met him for the first time in like 12 years or so. I don't know why, he just tried to do it. Just woke up and my grandma was panicking and the cops were there. But he's alive isn't that a good thing you might be asking. I only have 1 or 2 memories of him before that.  But now the first thing I think of whenever I see his name anywhere is oh yea he tried to kill himself with most of his kids in the vicinity. I don't forgive him for that even to this day. And even to this day he hasn't even acknowledged what he did or how it may have affected any of us. Oh and it turns out he was a rapist so thats just the cherry on top. But he's already done his dammage to more than just me. Idk if I'll forgive him enough to attend his funeral. I was also mentally fucked with when I was a kid not by my mom but by my cousin and uncle. I recall one memory in peticular where we were coming home in a truck and I had left my bike laying on the ground. Then my uncle said he was going to run it over with the truck and my cousin went along with it thinking that it was funny. They didn't stop even when I was screaming and crying, they just kept saying we're going to run it over. Then we drove over some bump and they both said something like oh man now your bike is broken. That's all I really remember. I was in tears and cried for what seemed like hours. And I was about 7 or 8 when this happened and it kind of makes alot of sense on why I don't really have the best relationship with that uncle or cousin. They lived near by and things like that would happen often. I heard that one time we went on a family camping trip and something happened between my uncle and I when I was very young and apparently nobody stopped it. I guess I blocked that memory completely out because I can't remember anything and nobody has told me anything except another uncle who was vague about the whole situation. Bad things happened and thats all I know. I want to know but at the same time ignorance is bliss. 
Recently I have been struggling with depression and cutting. I feel empty and lonely, and like everything isn't working out for me. but every time I go out I get really uncomfortable and end up going back home and retreating to my room. Recently I've started talking to a newer friend about everything and they have been letting me vent and help try to motivate me not to cut. They're really understanding, but only talking to them doesn't feel like its enough. I want to go see a therapist, but unfortunately I don't have the money or insurance for it. So I guess the next best thing is reddit. Not really but it can't hurt at this point.",18Dec2020,0

136,"I've recently noticed and become more aware of my constant tendency to take things to extremes. I really don't know why, really, like I don't know what I get out of it, but I always have the urge to do everything excessively. I've always been aware of this when it comes to drinking and such, but I've realised I subconsciously do it with everything else, too.

I also try to replace my bad habits with less bad ones. Like, I want to do drugs, but I shouldn't, so I drink instead to keep myself from doing drugs. I shouldn't drink so much, so I smoke to keep myself from drinking. I shouldn't smoke, so I do all sorts of shit to keep myself from it. Like drink as much coffee as I possibly can, even though I'm not tired. Refuse to sleep, make myself as tired as I can, just for the hell of it. Crash my bike on purpose when I'm drunk! Literally. I'm known for crashing on purpose because I'm bored lmaooo. That one is a little funny. But still not cool, I've tried with healthy ways of coping, but I take it to extremes, so it stops being healthy. (I tried running, but I ended up running *a lot,* and I stopped eating. I don't have body image issues, just wanted to see how far I could take it, just because.)

It's good that I'm aware of it, I suppose, but I have NO idea *why* I feel like this and do these things. I literally feel the urge to smoke until I throw up. This makes *no sense,* I logically don't want to smoke that much, and I don't want to throw up. But I do.

144,"I used to get this all the time. Even from people who struggled with their own mental health in various ways. I don't sleep well, I don't go out much, I don't talk to people very often, and there was a time where all I'd ever do was go to college, come home, do nothing and then sleep. If I was struggling I would tell people, and so many people responded with 'you're just depressed because you don't do things you enjoy' or 'you're anxious because you don't sleep enough'  etc, and it would ultimately make me feel as though it was my fault that I wasn't well mentally. 

Looking back, all of the things people would tell me were causing my mental health to decline were just symptoms of it already declining. Don't blame yourself if you don't do much. Don't blame your anxiety on a lack of sleep or your depression on your lack of motivation and interest, and don't blame yourself if you do anything else that people say are causing your problems. No one wants to have bad mental health, no one wants to suffer. 

The things you do that are exacerbating your issues are almost always symptoms of your issues, and it takes a lot of work and time to straighten things out sometimes. I feel as though if someone had told me that my negative cycles were the result of an ill mind instead of the cause, I would have understood myself a lot sooner than I did, I would have been able to find different ways to help myself other than trying to suppress symptoms of a bigger problem. Please know that it's not your fault if you're struggling to help yourself, but please never stop trying to get better, because one day you'll look back on your life and realise you weren't well, and you'll forgive yourself for all of the things you struggled with.

For example, yesterday I snapped at them. We have two group chats, one where we send memes and another. In both of them when i send something it seems to get ignored, but when this other person shares something everyone is quick to answer.

When we met up, one friend made a joke about how disconnected from them my humor was. It also feels like whenever I do something they lash out but when someone else does the same thing it's OK. 

I've been trying to excuse it but yesterday I lost control. I wrote in the group chat (honestly my mistake, didn't expect them to answer) that I had a question, and one of them answered. I told them I felt ignored and it ended with everyone telling me how its not OK that I sent that text even after I deleted it. I left that group after that.

151,"I’m posting this to hear about other’s experiences with managing their anxiety and hopefully get some guidance on what I can do. 

Little back story: I’ve had mild anxiety my whole life. It’s never had a significant effect on my life until this year. The combination of starting nursing school in January and COVID has really led to my anxiety skyrocketing. I’ve experienced a number of physical symptoms that I haven’t really experienced before such as insomnia, headaches, lack of appetite, and twitching eye (due to stress and lack of sleep). The smallest inconveniences/problems can lead to a full-blown anxiety attack. For example, I once made a mistake booking a first-aid class and wasn’t sure how to fix it (it was an online booking and telephone operators wouldn’t be open until the morning after) which led to an anxiety attack that night. Looking back, it wasn’t necessarily un-fixable and losing the money for the class wouldn’t have been the end of the world, but at that time all I could do was (literally) freak out about my mistake. 

I’ve tried counseling, but I didn’t find it effective. It was temporarily relieving to have my feelings validated by a professional but it did not provide much long-term help. I’ve tried meditating, exercising, deep breathing exercises, etc. but nothing seems to work. 

My questions for people who experience anxiety and/or anxiety attacks are:

What do you do to manage your anxiety? 

Why do you do during and after an anxiety attack? 

Have you tried medicine to manage your anxiety? Was/is it effective? 

What are you experiences with counseling/therapy/psychiatry?

The events are unrelated and both do to circumstances I had little control over. I am a father of a 2 year old, my wife is pregnant, and I just feel like a major fuck up. Things were going well too. We had paid off a huge chunk of our debt that had accumulated over this bullshit year, and were looking to have a decent christmas on top of everything else. Now I have to cancel Christmas and find a new place to live in 12 days and find a job that pays our minimum requirements on top of that. Not to mention find health insurance again so we can properly support ourselves and my wifes high risk pregnancy. I also now have to clean a long neglected apartment, and pack it. I have to find money too. The plus side is I can sell off a lot of valuable Magic cards, but even with that saving grace its hard to watch a hobby I've invested into for 5 years mostly just vanish. My wife is still working, but she gets paid bi-weekly and because she gets all of Christmas week off, she also doesn't get paid for that. Rentals around here aren't super cheap either. I mean it's not California, but still. I have so much shit I have to do, and the compounding pressure makes it hard to do any of it. I can't enjoy any games or video or distractions of any kind and I have no sense of hope or enthusiasm for finding jobs or a place to live. I feel like such a failure.

This shit seems to constantly happen to me too. So many times have I been in a situation where things are going good, I'm riding high, and suddenly a series of disasters happen and I get fucked. It's hard to move forward and have hope when it feels like god himself is just gunna shove a boot up my ass. I already suffer from multiple mental disorders and this crap makes it so much worse.

However, I am studying medicine and I have gone through some concepts like depersonalisation and derealisation and I was joking with my friend that all people feel the same as in the definition of both these terms but surprisingly they said no we don’t relate to this feeling !! I was shocked because I felt what I feel usually is normal but it appears it is not. I feel like this body is not mine as if I am watching this person living. I feel that my surrounding is fake and cartoon not actual things.

I don't feel like I feel anything at all, at least nothing good, not for too long. Most days I just feel empty or sad or angry for hours upon hours, or could just contemplate suicide for hours, and I don't know why, I wanna fix it but I don't know how and this is killing my slowly.

I know I have depression, therapist figured that out, and I'm taking meds for it (Zoloft I think?) but I really don't feel that they work but everyone tells me I'm getting better but I don't feel I am, and I've told them.

I just... wanna know the source of these things so I can fix them... I wanna fix my lack of feeling, I wanna get better meds, I want to stop being suicidal but I don't know how. My therapist just tells me to try to recognize I'm content but I don't know how, same for everything else. 

I also forgot to mention another thing... I'm very dependent on others for emotion and I want to fix that but I've been trying on my own for so long but I haven't gotten any better... I've probably just gotten worse.

160,"I have/had some things about myself that I would like to ask about. I'm not entirely sure if they are related to mental health, but this sub I think would be my best option to ask about.

1. This is something I no longer have, but When I turned five untill I think around 10 or 12 I had it. It was at night I would always see dark worm-like beings just crawling around. My eyes were open also. It seemed like they weren't particularly coming for me, but they constantly moved around. I was up until I couldn't stay awake at all moving to avoid the worms.

2. I feel like I can dream in 3d. This is kind of like point 1. I'd say it's more like a semi-lucid dream. I'll talk to the dream people I see and then they would talk back to me. Here's a weird example; I don't sleep with my shirt and lots of time I've experienced this ""dream"", I'm getting some kind of award, but since it's at the school and I don't have a shirt on I can't claim it. If I get out of bed, open my door and turn on my lights everything I see is gone.

3. This what I call my schedule thing. Say for example I get out of school around 3:30 and at 6 I have something. Between then I'll feel stressed about doing anything because I know at one point it could be interupted to go to that thing at 6.

165,"I have a question regarding the causes of emotional problems and if there is a way to determine the underlying cause.

So there are bad experiences and missing social needs that can cause declining mental health like trauma, Isolation, consequences of bullying etc.

Then there are „physical“ causes like wrong diet, illnesses, lack of sleep, hormone imbalances etc.

Is there a way to differentiate these two categories? Is there a difference in symptoms between Depression/anxiety caused by one vs the other?

Unmet social/emotional needs VS a physical problem? 

Sometimes I’m not sure whether a bad life situation is the cause of unhappiness , or underlying physical issues are not allowing my body/brain to be calm and content which then lead to a bad life situation.

My mom died when I was 7, and every day for 17 years I've relived that pain. I used to sit and I think about how she'll never see me marry, she'll never see her grandchildren, or meet my wife. I think about how my grandma lost her daughter and got forced into raising me and my siblings, effectively ruining her life and her plans for her future. I think about how it got to be too much for her and she had a mental breakdown, and how I caused it. 

It's not just the major stuff I think about though. It's every little traumatic experience I've ever had. I wouldn't describe them as flashbacks, but it's pretty damn close to what it feels like. It'll be a normal day, I'll be working and get hit with the mental image of my dead dog, or the last time my mom and I went to the lake together and she had a coughing fit. No trigger, just random, intrusive negative memories on loop. Like I said in the title though, it's not hurting me anymore. Or rather, not hurting me as much as it used to. 

Six months ago I was sat in a dark room, drunk and thinking about sending my brains through the roof. Today, I'm just...here. I don't feel good, but I don't feel miserable anymore. Instead of self pity and anger, I just want to follow what I want. I want to live, and I want to make the most of it.

I ended up emailing my teacher in the thick of my panic attack in a massive tangent and he's given me an extra day (which I'm so grateful for) but I still feel really bad about it because I read the email back later and it was an absolute mess. but I'm so mentally drained now and I have to be up really early to do some stuff and I'm absolutely dreading it.

I'm also really dreading Christmas because I have an eating disorder, and this is probably the worst relapse I've had into my eating disorder (I physically can't finish a single meal per day, my body is exhausted cause I can't manage to eat anything and I've started having panic attacks when food shopping) so I'm not coping very well mentally and physically, and having to be around transphobic family while also trying to manage an eating disorder over Christmas is something I'm absolutely dreading. 

I also have to somehow manage to hide all of my self harm scars, which isn't going to be easy. they're mostly on my thighs, with some also down my shoulder, and while they'll likely go away in the next month or so, they're still visible now and that's an issue. if I were anywhere else I wouldn't be so concerned because idgaf about what people think but because I'm home with my family, if they spot it they're going to have a fucking fit at me, and that's only gonna make things worse right now. I can do my best to wear jeans for a majority of the time but I can only get away with that so often when I'm living out of a suitcase for two weeks, and I've just bought some new bathers to cover the ones on my thighs so I can swim if I want to while I'm home, but fucking hell am I dreading it. being at home feels like high school all over again and I hate it, but I can't complain about it to my friends cause most of them are excited to be home to see their families since covid has made it hard, and I don't wanna bring down the mood down just because I don't feel the same personally.

For the next few weeks i began searching everything there is to know about ADHD, and thought that i may have it, but i am really confused. The symptoms that do fit me are hyper, sometimes distracted, concentration issues, making sloppy mistakes on test because i skip over words, i tend to be bored easily and skip for example with books and movies, in class i cant stop talking to the people beside me and i act impulsively sometimes, and keep procrastinating, losing my keys,cards,phone, books etc every single dat y i lose something, While all this makes it seem that i have adhd it could also not be it, because one thing that i came across was that people with ADHD have constant racing thoughts they can’t turn off, i don’t really identify with this for some occasions as exceptions, i dont even remember thinking, and when i think of thinking of thinking i can’t think and my mind becomes blank, i also don’t have sleeping problems because of Racing thought because when i am tired my thohghts turn off, i do have rejection sensitivity and sometimes hearing processing problems, moodswings, but my thought process doesn’t really fot the description of someone with ADHD, i did like 10 online tests and they al said i had ADHD-c, i want to go to the doctor to test it but i am scared that when i say the symptoms that they are going to diagnose me because there is no formal test for adhd its based on a psychologist’s observation, but i may not even have it , maybe all those things are just my personality and some other issue, me being like this has caused me some distress to some degree, but never enough to cause me to think i may have a disorder. As a child i could focus in class because i was scared of being rejected and not having a future, i displayed some of my “symptoms” in childhood like talking excessively, rejection sensitivity and procrastination, sloppy mistakes but because i was smart and such a good student who always payed attention they never suspected anything cus in class i always shut my mouth (when i was younger). I feel as though the symptoms have increased as i have become older. I want to go to a doctor to test it but i dont want to waste their time if i dont have it. Anyways i want to know if some of you relate to what i said, or that i dont relate to you. I probably don’t have it but i could but i probably don’t, when i am at home i shut my mouth, i really started questioning it when i had so much concentration problems when studying for physics and them remembering other times i had that, but i dont have that much concettation and distraction issues atleast that is what i think.

I have been trying to lose weight because I know that will fix alot of the problems I am having, but in the meantime its been really difficult, I had to quit my job, which payed more than I have ever made since dropping out of highschool. I was doing great handling it for years, until I had a full blown panic attack at work, first one ive ever had btw. I made it out of the building while having it which was a good sign. Since then I just have not been the same person, couldnt drive for about 2 months or even ride passanger due to anxiety. They put me on meds, four different to be exact, and none of them worked but pronanolol, but guess what no job no insurance. I saved the last of them I had for emergencies and now im just trying to get back living normally again, been thinking about self medicating with marijuana because I DO NOT sleep and if I do its for maybe an hour to 3 hours. I look like a fucking zombie everyday because of this and the constant worry and googling of imaginary symptoms. My latest worry is when I look to the sife with just my eyes and not moving my head I get dizzy, been in that one for five days now, pretty sure I have a brain tumor. Last symptom was high blood pressure and my high pulse, which comes with being morbidly obese. They also did a blood test when I had the first panic attack, they said they were surprised at how healthy everything came back considering my weight.

When I was 12, as my peers were socializing, going through several developmental milestones, I was rotting in front of my computer. In highschool, as my classmates were experiencing their first relationships, first kisses, I was rotting in my room, coping with video games and drugs. Now that I am 18, most people I know have got career prospects for the future, and yet here I am, in my room, rotting. If one day, I were to want to ''break the shell'' and join the society, how could I possibly interact with those people? I haven't talked to anyone besides my parents for the last year or so, but I know for a fact that me and ''them'' belong to different species. You can't expect a cave bat and a deer to get along well. Once one reaches a certain age with no forms of socialization, it's all hopeless. For now, I live off of my parents. But eventually, I won't be able to. Since they do not have any form of wealth whatsoever, I'll be fucked if I don't have some means of income.

191,"I have a friend (let's call him Ben) that I'm not very close with, he's more of a friend of a friend. I occasionally see him at parties, gatherings, that kind of thing. Whenever I see him we're friendly.

I recently heard from one of our mutual friends that Ben attempted suicide. He was admitted to hospital (this was about two weeks ago.) He stayed there for a few days, and then he was released. I saw him after, at a gig. He seemed happy, a little distant, but still telling jokes, surrounded by friends, being supported. I felt better seeing him like this. I spoke to him briefly, he seemed fine. As a survivor of a suicide attempt it's a very sensitive topic for me, I thought of bringing it up, asking if he was doing better, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. I also felt like it wasn't my place because like I mentioned, we're not close friends, he doesn't really share his issues with me and I know suicide is a very sensitive topic. I know that people that are closer to him are more likely to get through to him, so I just trusted that he was surrounded by the right people and told myself I was overthinking things.

However, last night one of our mutual friends let me know that Ben is planning on ending things, for certain this time. He put a date on his death (the 28th of December.) He told all his closest friends that he loves them and he will watch over them but he just can't do this anymore.

As a very distant friend, I feel that I shouldn't be the first person to get involved, however, it seems like nobody is doing anything and I feel so helpless as I would be broken if something happens to Ben and I didn't do anything to prevent it. I live in South Africa and called a suicide prevention line this morning to ask for advice. I was told that, as a last resort, my best bet is to get his parents to sign some forms at a police station so that he can be involuntarily admitted to get psychiatric help.

Here's where it gets complicated, because his parents, from what I've heard, are a big part of the problem. They know about his last attempt, and they know he's planning on ending his life very soon. They're not doing anything. His father apparently does not care, and his mother is sad over it, but hasn't cared enough to take action. 

I just feel helpless, as do all of his close friends. What can we do? Ben is above the age of 18 and as far as I'm concerned I can't force him to get help. He also won't voluntarily get help himself, and I fear that because Ben and I are not very close, it will be very difficult for me to get through to him and help him in a situation like this.

I just want to know if anyone has been in a similar situation, how did you cope with it? Who did you contact? What approach can I take? Do I stand any chance of saving him or is this one of those things I have no control over?


TL;DR : My friend is planning to attempt suicide, his close family has not gotten involved and tried to help him. As someone who is only a distant friends, are there any approaches I can take to save him, and if so, what are my options? 

I thank you in advance.",18Dec2020,1
192,"I was diagnosed with depression around 4 years ago and I've been on medication ever since, also 
 I know that depressive episodes may come from time to time. However, I never know how to differentiate between me being lazy or actually having a depressive episode. I just got out of a really stressful semester and ever since vacations started I don't feel motivated to do anything and I lay around in bed pretty much all day. I don't feel like doing stuff that used to make me happy and it's just sad because my thoughts tell me there is no point on doing that. However, as I mentioned before, last semester was tough and I don't know if I'm just mentally tired. I've been feeling like this for around three weeks, and I constantly have to force myself to do stuff. Also, my dad was hospitalized about a week ago and that made me pretty anxious, but I was already feeling depressed/lazy by then. My dad is now ok, but I don't know if that may have also affected my mental health. 

My therapist told me that among her college students patients it was common to feel anxious/unmotivated at the end of the semester because of all the exams and projects and stuff. So then again, maybe what I'm feeling is common.

Also, if any of you could help me figure out the differences between a depressive episode and just... bare laziness (?) I would really appreciate it. Thanks",18Dec2020,2

194,"It's 3am and my mental health has reached rock bottom so far. I usually am really good at opening up to people and I can do it quite comfortably but I don't even know where to start to get the ball rolling. I'm upset, sad and... to be frank, depressed and I don't know what started it and therefore I don't know how to address something I can't see. 



I feel like I'm always there for people but they're never there for me. My friends say I'm a great listener but they never listen to me. I always try my hardest to make people comfortable and I try present myself well. I asked if I could talk to one of my few friends that I trusted that could I can open up to and she said she was busy today but she could another time, turns out she was busy talking to my other friends and essentially ignored my cries for help. 


They lie to me about what they're doing, like they're hiding something from me. I call them out on it (not in a rude way) but why? Why did you have to lie?


I want to cry it all out but I can't. I tried everything, sad music, sad movies, sad everything but I'm too sad to cry. I feel emotionally numb. I feel nothing. I never understood why people self harmed but now I do... It's because they want to feel something, well that's with me anyways and I've not acted on it yet but I've been close.



The only person I've told about this was my ex-girlfriend (who I am on good terms with) because I've helped her through her problems and she tried to help me but she said ""I just endured it, you live with it and you do things to forget about it"". 



I've had more stressful times in my life but I feel this is the lowest point... Ever. I want this to end but I don't know how. I've always helped my friends with their mental health issues and giving them advice because I've learnt to deal with my demons in the past and it's worked. I had good self esteem and was mentally healthy. But now I'm doubting myself because I'm seeing all my friends talk to each other, vibin with each other and when I'm around we still have a good time but... I still feel forgotten, isolated, alone. 



It makes me question who I am as a person, what's my problem and that's what tanked my self esteem. Everyone says I'm fine but why is it that they ignore me? Why is it that they exclude me from things... I can't fucking deal with that. If there's something wrong with me then tell me. It kills me mentally saying that they're always there for me but leave me hanging when they know I'm going through a rough patch. 


Well I've laid it out but how do I explain this to someone who I think has never felt this way before? It's subjective, no one ever is in the same situation...",18Dec2020,1
195,"sorry if my English is not good

I am a top student in my class and have received an award in front of the whole school.  But my studies have recently become a pressure for me because even when I'm in the first place, my parents always said that the score was not high enough.  I am a person who cannot balance my looks and studies, meaning that when I focus on my studies, I don't care about my appearance.  This year, I have gained 7 kg and my dad said I look disgusting, knowing that my dad is joking, I still feel sad.  My father always wanted a beautiful daughter who studied well and communicated well with outsiders.  sometimes I think that dying is the exit in life because I don't have to worry about anything anymore.  I've always dreamed of a career related to art such as makeup or design, but my dad always objected and said I'm going nowhere in the future.  Lately, I've started to get affected by other people's words, I might be acting fine, but at night when I got back to my room I started to cry by myself until I slept.  I still have close friends who listen to what I share, but I don't find it helpful.  I wish I could become optimistic and strong enough to move forward with my dreams.  every time I became too emotional I started slapping myself and laughing while looking in the mirror, seeing myself in chaos somehow calmed me down to normal.  I go to school from 7 am to 5 pm every day of the week, sometimes until 10 pm, I always lack of sleep and the time to go to relax is nearly not existed.  lately, I started arguing with my dad about my dad not letting me go home late with my friends on weekends (I always have a Sunday night outing every week and I just hang out then).  I feel extremely pressured because the only time for me to be free and happy was taken away. After the argument, I always hurt myself by scratching my hand, slapping my face, and crying to calm down.  am I okay?",18Dec2020,3
196,"Hello,
  (Side note: just to clarify on what ""spiralling"" means. It is based on the analogy of a whirpool / spiral. In which your thoughts will start to ""spiral"" down and get worse overtime.)

Today, I just broke down. Though there wasn't an uneventful occurance this week, I was still at my worst. I was unproductive and didn't do that much (thankfully, christmas break already came). I was starting to get myself together today. You know, starting to become productive and doing things I'm supposed to. However, I had a major problem. I am currently studying an instrument and didn't have that much practice this week. And I don't want to have a lesson when I'm unprepared because a lesson costs alot (each lesson/meet with the teacher is about 10$ for an hour). So I just messaged my teacher that i'll skip class again because I was unproductive (I skipped last week because I had to finish school works). But I had recieved a message saying that being unproductive is bad because it will just result to much more unproductiveness and other stuff. It's just that caught me offguard. And just as I was about to get myself together, I just really can't help but overthink things which then resulted to things spiralling. It's as if I'm back to square one but worser.

For sure my teacher doesn't really mean harm on it, but it just triggered this spiralling I have. And I just really would like to ask advice on how I may build resillence upon matters that may trigger spiralling.

198,"Especially mentally healthy people. 

To be clear, I am not one to burden others with my problems (except on Reddit) because I myself don’t like to be overburdened with things like that, especially if it’s not reciprocal. 

However, one thing I have heard a lot of people say is “you should talk to your therapist about that.” On the one hand, that’s exactly the appropriate thing to say and that’s probably what I would say. 

On the other hand, hearing that bothers me, not because it’s not true, and not because I want them to say anything else or offer validation (usually I take this as a hint that I should stop unloading on them and I think that’s absolutely a good thing to be aware of) but because behind that statement I feel like there is an assumption that just by talking to a therapist things will improve. I guess it’s kind of also the trust people seem to put in healthcare professsionals and mental health care professionals, especially people who themselves have never been to one, as these people who absolutely know best and have a very precise and accurate way of diagnosing and treating things. But in my experience that has been so far from the case. Even the most well intentioned and brilliant therapists and psychiatrists have not helped at all or made things worse. I don’t blame them. They aren’t fortune tellers and the brain isn’t an exact science but I guess what bothers me is the way people say “only a psychiatrist can diagnose you — they have years of training” as if it’s simple like that. 

I have been diagnosed and undiagnosed so many times, put on medications that almost killed me, been re-traumatized and demobilized by talking about trauma in therapy and had so many conflicting diagnoses, suggestions and opinions on how I should be treated for my mental illnesses and how I should process my trauma.

I have even been told by some psychiatrists that traditional talk therapy could make things worse for me! I think what has helped the most is not anything from therapy, or medication, but simply the wisdom I’ve gained from different life experiences, conversations, perspectives and most of all novels and fiction.",18Dec2020,1

Hi everyone, I just joined the group, I needed something to rant too and I want to spread my story I don’t know why but thank you for reading, anyways...

I’m an 18 year old female whose live in the UK, I got diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, overactive thyroid and Coeliac disease. Aswell as emotionally unstable personality disorder(eupd), anxiety + depression, ADHD+Autism. 

This year has been the toughest year of my life not only COVID 19 happened but my mental health has been the worst.
 In March I went into a children mental health hospital about 4 hours away from me, I was there untill I turned 18 in May. 
Then in June I was diagnosed with eupd, it was so hard to get used to and still am, I’m still learning about the disorder, but it’s hard to read up on it, does anyone else relate to this? I think it triggers me because I know it’s me and i have it. 

Eupd is so hard, draining, and depressing, I end up in hospital(normal hospital) every 2 weeks due attempting suicide. I don’t know many people with eupd so if you do or have bpd please comment below so i know I’m not alone. 

So now I’m December I’m moving to a care home especially people with severe mental illnesses I’m nervous yet excited, being at my home now with my 12 year old sister, and parents. I’m not save there nor my family is not safe aswell, I’m not going to say what happened but it’s very scary.

223,"So, background story.

My mom's an addict and my dad and I have been dealing with it for about 4 years now. Sometimes on it she can get a little... angry.
Two days ago, after a couple months, she had a relapse. She hallucinates and says crazy stuff. I told my friend about it because I found it almost funny, but she got incredibly worried that I was in severe danger and she caved and called CPS.
CPS came over that day and we managed to keep him out of the house. I didn't know at this point that it was my friend who reported me. I told her about what was going on, because I trusted her, and I kind of laughed about how we BS'ed the whole interview. My mom's fine now, she really is, but CPS doesn't know that and neither does my friend or my grandma who we live with and has the power to kick us out. I came in school for an exam today, which I thought was odd since everything's virtual and I was the only one coming in. Afterwards, I was pulled into a room with a social worker who then proceeded to prod at me. I lied and I lied but eventually he showed me the screenshots of me texting my friend and there was nothing I could do other than say I was exaggerating. He promises mom's not going to jail and nobody is getting into trouble, but my bio-dad (who lives about 45 minutes away) will know, and he's not gonna be happy about me lying all these years, and so will my grandma.
Essentially, here's what's going to go down: CPS will tell my grandma what's going on, but my grandma won't kick me or my dad out, it'll be my mom. She's going to be kicked out and my mom and dad will pretty much either have to break it off or see each other in secret. Maybe she'll have to go to rehab, but that's on her. Since mom has already broken grandma's trust in the past twice I think, I doubt she's gonna forgive her (you may never know), but she has a home both in a house close by and and her parents which are also close by.

I have a Dissociatives disorder( it’s more like a symptom of another disorder)
Specifically DPDR mostly  Derealisation.

In the last two years I have been waking up with cuts all over my body that I don’t remember doing, I have been open about it with my psychiatrist and through out the years I have developed good strategies(the tipp skill, 5 sensors, dbt stuff) to help with grounding.

However about a mouth ago I woke up to a very shocking cut that ended up me needing stitches, this was terrifying because it has never gotten that bad before.
After this I have been waking up to pretty scary looking cuts. 
Christmas is a very triggering time for me and my physic and social worker is not available through the holidays, I have Contacts to some mental health crises teams but I am scared.

I don’t know what I do in these states I don’t remember Anything.
I am working out with my social worker before they have Christmas break to get me in a
Housing place from Christmas eve till Boxing Day.
 but because I am I’m not in any immediate danger and I have a house that I can live in I have been rejected from all of them so fair (which I understand and is valid)

I am really scared, I don’t know what to do, I think I’m doing everything right so fair but I can’t shack this feeling off, I feel so powerless in this.

What do I do, can anyone help me? Has anyone else had this?",18Dec2020,1

229,"Title basically. I’m terrified by the way my memory and the vast majority of my life just seem to be gone. My friends will bring up past things we did together and I’ll go along with it in the moment but in reality I remember nothing. There are some events here and there that I’ll remember occasionally, but I can’t pinpoint them on a timeline and they’re foggy, I can hardly remember details beyond a basic emotion attached to it. Sometimes looking at pictures taken during an event helps a little but it’s horrible, I feel like I don’t even know who I am anymore. My short term memory has become terrible too, the only way I know what I’ve been doing all day is because I got into the habit of documenting everything I do each day - it’s the only way I can remind myself that I exist. 

I know extreme memory loss like this is often due to trauma/PTSD, yet I’m almost certain I’ve never been through a traumatic or PTSD-inducing event that would cause this. I’ve heard of depression leading to memory loss, but would it cause it on such a big scale? I’m only 18 yet I just barely remember 2 of those 18 years.

He maintains that it’s a good practice for helping people develop a “resilience” to the harsh realities of the world, like when people join the military and are subjected to certain things. But as someone who experienced legitimate abuse from my older siblings in my youth, I have a different perspective. I feel like the lines between good natured teasing and legitimate abuse can easily be blurred and that this practice may unintentionally normalize abuse and make it harder for people to recognize, and make people less likely to speak up when it is happening.

I didn't think about it for months and then suddenly ""puff! remember when...?"" (In addition, I heard someone correlating Pedophilia with the LGBTQ+ community, and being a part of it, it was kind of a trigger.)

So I've been dealing with some pocd thoughts lately and so when I'm scrolling through Instagram and see someone I find attractive I frequently need to go in their bio to check their age. Some of them don't have it, some do and are my age or older and there was this one who was 13 (I'm 16, turning 17 next month) and made me freak out (even though I understand it's not that big of a deal). Bedsides, when the person is older, my mind goes like ""well, you only liked them cause they look younger"" which is horrible.
And also my brain has been kinda like ""you were never actually attracted to anyone your age or older that is just a lie you tell yourself"" lately (which is completely untrue but still makes me feel awful). 

Also, I think I have to say that I've never felt interested in kids (I actually don't really like them) and actually have lots of crushes in older celebrities (and am in love with someone my age). 

This is the second time I'm dealing with pocd thoughts and it sucks so I'd like to know:

1. Can that ""checking the bio"" thing be a compulsion? 
2. Any advice on the thoughts? 

I'd really appreciate any help you could give me!",18Dec2020,1

I’ve been feeling extremely numb and incapable of processing emotion to its full potential. Last night my boyfriend came over- we spend every single night together with no awkwardness or anything of the sorts. I felt so anxious in his presence, like I didn’t know who he was. He was doing nothing wrong and was being exceptionally sweet, as usual. He was talking and it felt like i was watching him talk from another perspective, like somebody hiding in the closet. It felt like i smoked weed and got weird around somebody I didn’t know... it made me feel horrible and guilty because I didn’t know why it happened and I’m sure it would make him sad to know I was feeling that way.

""I like you"" makes it all about you and minimize it; ""I understand"" or ""I'm with you"" add nothing, it's not enough if they are close to you; ""That's not true"" or ""You're ok this way"" vanish the whole thing that made them suffer...

250,"Phones, iPads, laptops, tablets.... everything is about social media these days. We are in the year 2020 and *everyone* owns a mobile phone, even if it’s a Nokia. To put it into perspective, it’s taken over everyone’s life. But, that’s not always a bad thing, it can be highly beneficial. Down below, I will be naming you **THE BEST** Mental Health apps you can have on your phone *TODAY*! Unfortunately, many people can’t afford therapy or counselling and because of that, their health deteriorates overtime. So, what do you do when you’re suffering with anxiety and depression, *but* you don’t have enough money to get professional help? You download an app of course! Some of the well-known app are not free, but that being said, they are a reasonable price. Included in the apps are many different forms of therapeutic techniques you can do at home and much more. **Sal Raichbach, PsyD, LCSW** said that the Mental Health apps have a brilliant potential to reach people who are not otherwise receive the help and support they truly need. These apps remove the barriers to treatments. He goes on to say “* Sadly, only a small percentage of people actively seek professional help for their mental health problems. This could be for any number of reasons: they may not be physically able to leave their homes due to severe anxiety or lack of mobility, or they may not have the financial means*”. 

Firstly.... there are **Suicide Prevention apps**. 

*MY3*

This app is designed for people who are having thoughts of Suicide. Thankfully, this app is completely free. It also lets you customise your own personal safety plan, list your own copying strategies and it also allows you to connect with helpful resources for when you need to reach out to someone. The app also puts you in direct contact with a trainer councillor from the **National Suicide Prevention Line** (24 hours a day and 7 days a week), alongside a 911 alert number. Also, it gives you the opportunity to choose up to **3** people to contact when you’re feeling weak, down and having suicidal thoughts. **This app is free on iOS and Android**. :) 

*notOK*

This app is dedicated to teenagers. Just like MY3, it is a free app. The app was created by a teenager who was struggling with depression, alongside her brother. When entering the app, you would then discover a very large red button which activates and lets your closest friends and family know that help is need. It’s a brilliant tool to have. So, whenever you’re feeling depression or hit with waves of anxiety, press on the big red button on the app, it will then alert your closest people. When you press the red button, a text alert will go out to **5** of your closest people, with the message sent being: “*Hey, I’m not OK! Please call, text, or come find me*”. **The app is free on iOS and Android**. :)

*General Mental Health Apps*

Firstly... **What’s App**. Don’t confuse this with WhatsApp! Once again, this application is completely free to use. The app uses Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and also Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT) methods to help the user cope with different kinds of Mental Health, such as depression, anxiety, stress and more. There will also be a tracker on the app. It is a positive and negative tracker that maintains your habits and also break the ones that are counterproductive. Inside the app, there is a feature called “*Get Grounded*, this particular section contains over 100 different questions to pinpoint how you’re currently feeling. Try it out yourself, today! **The app is free on iOS and Android**. :) 

*Twenty-Four Hours A Day*

This app is based off the best-selling book of the exact same name. This app offers you a wide range of meditations from the book (366, to be exact). This app will make it much easier for people to recovery from different addictions and to focus on sobriety wherever they are. **Free to download on iOS and Android.** :) 

**Apps for people dealing with Anxiety**

*MindShift*

According to Psycom, **MindShift** is one of the best Mental Health apps out there, today. It was specifically designed for adults and teenagers who are currently suffering with anxiety. Rather than let people’s feeling get the better of them, MindShift shows us all the importance of changing how you actually think about anxiety. This app will encourage you, and encourage you more. It will motivate you to take charge of your life, to ride out moments which get intense and how to face challenge situations in your life. **Free to download on iOS and Android**. :)

*CBT Thought Record Diary*

The CBT app will document all of your negative thinking and emotions, analyse the flaws in your thinking and it will also reevaluate your thoughts. This app will help you gradually change your approach to anxiety by including emotions and your different thinking patterns for future situations. **Free on iOS and Android!** :) 

**Depression Apps** 

*Talkspace Online Therapy*

Now, here is the first application I have included that has a price tag on it. To begin with, this application starts off at $65 a week, which is very pricey. But, that being said, here is what’s included... you will be in contact and able to text a trained professional in this department. Not only that, but you are able to text this person as much as you want. You will be getting daily responses. As I said, the app begins at $65 a week to talk to a trainer professional, which I believe is better than paying $200-300 an hour to talk with a trained professional in person, once a week. The choice is entirely yours! **The whole plan ranges between $65-99 a week and is available to download on iOS and Android**. :)

*Happify*

This app is approved by a professional psychologist. It offers different mood-training programmes. It also offers games, gratitude prompts, activity suggestions and more ways to train your brain. Thankfully, it’s completely free and you can try it out today! **It’s free to download on iOS and Android**. :) 

**Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder apps**

*nOCD*

Brilliantly, the app nOCD was designed by the help of OCD specialists and patients to incorporate 2 different treatments, such as: mindfulness and exposure response prevention treatment. On this app, you’ll be receiving immediate and supportive guidance when OCD strikes. You’ll also be able to assess yourself by taking weekly tests on the severity of your OCD, while having motivational support along the way. One of the users to this app said “it’s like having a free therapist in your pocket at all times”. **It’s free to download on iOS and Android**. :) 

*WorryWatch*

The 2nd app on this list which contains a price-tag, but thankfully, not much. You’re able to get this app for $3.99! But, before you purchase it, here’s what you need to know... this application aims to help its users identify their trigger points for anxiety, to note trends in their feelings and reflect on when the outcomes were harmless. Also, it aims to change their thinking patterns for the future. WorryWatch is like your very own diary, and you’re able to **download it on iOS and Android for $3.99**. :) 

*Breathe2Relax*

Sometimes in life, we just need to breathe and remind ourselves that everything is going to be okay, no matter what. This is what Breathe2Relax is all about. The application was created by the National Center for Telehealth and Technology. It is a portable stress management app that teachers it’s users a skilled called “diaphragmatic breathing”. This app is fantastic for people dealing with PTSD. **Free to download on iOS and Android**. :)

If you have any questions or request, let me know and I’ll be more than happy to provide you with some additional help, support or even another app! :)

I was also diagnosed with DID more recently (in spring) and I’m struggling with that. Would I know if I had DID?

I’ve also had multiple concussions and wonder/think maybe the memory loss is more related to the concussions. I just feel like I’ve been misdiagnosed. I took the MMIP and had an interview and a few other test all preformed by a neuropsychologist to get this diagnosis, but it just seems wrong.

I stopped attending online school after the first week, my school email is filled with complaints, teachers reporting my all zeroes progress and I'm over here playing pc games, sleeping, watch youtube and do absolutely nothing productive. Ever since I was forced to go attend boarding college prep-school, I was doing great for the first 2 years to please my parents, but since no one is forcing me to do anything. I just, stopped, I stopped talking to people, I dont answer calls, I dont answer emails, I just... stopped. I lack purpose, the only thing that brings me joy is online communities back in my home country, I felt happier playing online games with friends, streaming and disregard everything that is related to my future. I believe that maybe, the pent up anger, sadness, despair I built for my time having to stay with my manipulative mom gas lighting and verbally abusing me for the past 17 years led to this. but, I know for a fact that it was my fault that I cant try, that I'm lazy and just a piece of shit of a human being.

For what it’s worth, I have no memory starting from about an hour before the accident until the day after (Dec 11).

255,"I (I'm 19, M) work with my sister(in her late thirties), who is the mother to two children. We live in the US in one of the biggest states, popular with immigration. One of her kids is a teenage boy about 16-17 the other is is teenage girl 13-14. Our house has about 9 people in it which is crowded for a small house like ours, but we make due with it. While on break with my sister, I overheard her speaking to her husband about how to help my nephew because he recently told her and his sister that he had planned to kill himself for the longest time. The only reason he didn't go through with it was because a friend talked him down.

I was horrified because my nephew is my best friend. He was the one I spent my time with the most, he would always play games with me, him and his sister would protect me from bullies(Weird right? the older kid needing help from the younger ones in his family?). I noticed that he's become closed off recently much more detached from the world, and even his family, say his sister. I chalked it up due to the death of my mother which had occurred last year plus I wasn't in the right mental space either, my mother and I didn't get along very well and at the time I was suffering from a lot of guilt. However my thoughts began to change when he informed my and my middle sister (his aunt late twenties) that he didn't feel anything. I didn't want to push it because I know that when it comes to mental health, you can't force someone to open up.

Nephew and his sister didn't have it easy growing up. He and his sister were heavily pushed to do well in school, otherwise they would be grounded etc (His mother had lightened up about it in recent years as she saw both him and her daughter constantly worrying about their grades.). Not only that but for a long time, he felt as though there was a bias towards his sister as his family never punished him and his sister equally. And I'm not going to pretend I was great with him either. I would constantly get into arguments with him about the stupidest of shit.

I need some advice please. I want to help him, but I also don't want to break that trust he has with his mother. I don't want him to think that his mother is spilling his thoughts to others. Yes I'm aware my sister should not have shared this info because it's the kind of thing that pushes people with mental health away, but please don't be rude to her. She's a mother whose never had to deal with her own mental issues growing up (Both my sisters are tough people who went through a lot of shit. She knows she's partially to blame how my nephew is feeling right now.), so she wouldn't even know how to handle her son's. How can I help my nephew without telling him I overheard his mother?

Sorry if this post is all over the place. I can't stop crying. I feel almost hysterical, I just want to help my Nephew

257,"My story:

Before the pandemic, I quit my job (of 6 years in clinic) to go full steam ahead at my dream and finish grad school for counseling quickly (or so I thought at the time). Last year I was able to secure an internship and that internship was canceled when the pandemic hit. My program has gone from a 2.5year program to a 3.5+year program. I won't even say how much I owe at this point...

The internship sites are swamped with applicants due to people (like myself) who have not been able to find internship. My school has been of little help. They blame the pandemic, have given us a list of over 50 sites (most unusable or don't meet requirements for the program... some are even in Nevada?), and told us in orientation, ""well... you might just not be able to find placement this year."".

I have an ongoing list of about 25 sites I have applied to and am going to start applying this week to WA state. I am exhausted and feeling disheartened. In the grand scheme of things I am grateful to still have a roof over my head, food in my stomach, and a supportive family, but I feel my time is running out to make my career dream come true. If this goes on for much longer I am going to have to drop out and find a job to start paying my loans back.

I appreciate you taking the time to read this. I am in the Portland, OR area. I am looking for any help, leads, recommendations, support I can get. It breaks my heart that future therapists are struggling with this due to the increased need and demand right now.",18Dec2020,3

I honestly feel so bad for her because she has it so much worse than me. But I've had like 7 mental breakdowns because she wasn't responding to my messages, and I realized i need to work on myself and give people some space. But today she also told me that she is going to drop out of college and join somewhere else where the pressure won't be as much (we major in dental surgery so it can get stressful). I'm honestly very happy for her that she decided to work on herself and is headed in the direction to heal herself. But on the other hand, I feel terrible and I cant explain why.

263,"I was first diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder at 12, though I’d been having panic issues since I was 7/8. I tried therapy once but I didn’t like the therapist at all and walked into her office one day, told her I was cured and never went back. For awhile I thought I was fine. My anxiety was manageable. I thought that was the end of it.

Sadly, towards the beginning of the year there was a pretty big earthquake in my city (the first one I’d ever experienced). I was living alone at the time and my partner was out of town, so she couldn’t relate to my fear. It woke me from my sleep and I couldn’t stop screaming, I thought my world was ending. I had never felt more unsafe in my life, and this was all within my own home. Since then my anxiety has spiraled out of control. 

I’ve suddenly become afraid of everything. Dying, being in a car accident, getting sick, getting rabies, becoming blind, becoming paralyzed, throwing up, getting a degenerative disease, being in another earthquake, dying completely alone, dying a painful death, being assaulted, being murdered. I’ve basically found a reason to be afraid of anything.

It’s becoming exhausting. I’m in a constant state of panic and feel like I’m not able to enjoy my life anymore. I hate being alone because it means I’m alone with my thoughts. I feel like I’m struggling to even distract myself from the constant whirlwind of fear.

Over the summer I had a pretty bad panic attack so my partner offered me a dab pen to try to see if it could calm me down, because that’s something that works for her. I thought I would love it if it could make my thoughts turn off. 

They did not turn off, but my control over my body did and I became so traumatized over feeling trapped inside my brain, a place I hate being. Even being under the influence of something that is supposed to make me feel calm and loosen me up, my anxiety wouldn’t quit. 

One night I somehow convinced myself I had Covid and convinced my body I couldn’t breath. It was so hard to fall asleep. 

Another day, I took a nap on my partners couch and suddenly remembered my real life outside of my dream realm and convinced myself I had slipped into a coma and that I would  be trapped in my dream realm for years. I woke up shortly after, crying my eyes out. 

I just feel trapped. Like I will never be able to escape this panicked state. I fear that I’ll drive myself to death before I can fix it.

Please tell me that there’s someone out there that has been able to overcome anxiety like this.",18Dec2020,1
264,"My life has become very repetitive the past few years and it feels like my mental ability to hold a conversation or pay attention has decayed. In the past I would like to think that I was rather well-spoken and creative, but now I struggle to find simple words in conversation and I stutter more as well as I find it hard to focus and I'm slower at problem solving. The way I speak through text is not comparable to how I speak out loud. I have some people in friend groups that ridicule me and seem to think of me as stupid, which just makes me more depressed. I am also stuck living with my grandmother at age 25, I was planning on moving this year with the 10k I saved up over 7 years but coronavirus stopped those plans. 

The way I live now is miserable, with an extremely tiny room in a tiny house and with no privacy as even at a moderate volume, anyone in the house could hear what I'm saying from the opposite side of the house. I feel like its drained my personality away as I am not fond of my family and I don't feel comfortable being myself around them. I hardly speak more than a couple sentences a day. I know I will feel like myself again once I get out of this place and this town, but in the now, I feel like everything I am is slipping away and my motivation is drained.

I'm sorry if this post is all over the place, its a spure of the moment kinda post. I need to vent, I don't feel like I have close friends that I can vent to anymore.

**TLDR**: Like many others, at some point in my life I’ve struggled with serious depression and social anxiety. While I endorse trying any and all of the techniques discussed in this post, seek professional help if you are struggling to overcome feelings of anxiety and depression. There is no shame in it, and I can honestly tell you therapy and medication helped me when I needed it. Some of my favorite tips in no particular order:

* Garden/Take Care of Houseplants
* Sing Out Loud 
* Organize and Declutter
* Dance Around your Home
* Take a break from social media
* Cook a healthy meal
* Do a 10-minute workout  


## Garden/Take Care of Houseplants

 [Several studies have shown that gardening has numerous health benefits](https://www.healthline.com/health/healthful-benefits-of-gardening#helps-fight-disease). For starters, pulling weeds and planting plants can be hard work! Exhausting yourself and getting exercise can help improve your sleep which is pivotal for positive mental health. Additionally, being outside in the sun allows the body to generate vitamin D. Vitamin D is essential for health and r[ecent studies on covid-19 have shown that vitamin D deficiency can increase covid-19 risks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-77093-z).   
Gardening has also been used to help treat addictions like alcoholism. [**Horticulture therapy**](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/03/health/sw-horticultural-therapy/index.html) has been used for decades and is backed by serious science. [**This study published on ResearchGate even discusses which plants work best to evoke positive and therapeutic sensation**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321134657_The_use_of_sensory_perception_of_plants_in_horticultural_therapy_of_alcohol_addiction_Journal_of_Therapeutic_Horticulture_272_-_2017_ISSN_2381-5337). The participants in the study ranked sunflower, chili pepper, lavender, lemon balm, sweet basil and wild chive as some of the most therapeutic and sensory-pleasing plants.

## Sing loud and proud

There are multiple health benefits to singing. Singing and/or making music exercises the brain and can [**release neurochemicals such as** ](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01096/full)[**β-endorphin**](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01096/abstract), one of the compounds that acts as a natural pain blocker. [**A study published in** ***Trends of Cognitive Sciences*** **shows evidence that singing is good for posture and breathing as well as mental focus**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364661305002901). It is also believed that regularly memorizing new songs can help prevent mental decline in old age too. Don't know what to sing? Top hits from my singalong list include:

***Bohemian Rhapsody*** by QUEEN

***Total Eclipse of the Heart*** by Bonnie Tyler

***Don’t Stop Me Now*** by Queen

***My Life Would Suck Without You*** by Kelly Clarkson

***Don’t Stop Believing*** by Journey

***I Get Around*** by The Beach Boys

## Organize Collections and Declutter

Even if it is just for 5–10 minutes, decluttering can be a little accomplishment that reduces anxiety and snowballs into feelings of productivity that can carry the rest of the day. There are known benefits of tidying up, and s[**tudies have shown that clutter competes for attention in the brain and can lead to stress and overconsumption of food and media**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2711870). If you don’t know where to start, I recommend making a declutter-list. On it put each room in your home and add a few bullet points of things that need to be cleaned/declutterd. Then try to check off one room every week until the place is clutter-free.

## Dance around your home

I love dancing and have done it since I was a kid. It is no secret that moving around and getting exercise is great for the body and mind. [**A Swedish study published in ScienceNordic looked at more than 100 teenage girls who struggled with mental health issues like anxiety and depression**](https://sciencenordic.com/adolescent-girls-dancing-depression/teen-girls-dance-away-the-blues/1379230). In the study, one group attended weekly dance classes and the other half did not. The study not only showed the girls who took the dance classes improved their mental health and mood, but also concluded that the positive effects lasted up to eight months after the dance classes ended.

## Take a break from social media

Limit it to 30 minutes a day if you feel depressed or anxious that day. A study published in [**Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology**](https://guilfordjournals.com/journal/jscp) concluded that limiting use of social media can result in less feelings of loneliness and depression. Additional studies have shown spending too much time on social media can [**drive the** ***fear of missing out*** **(FOMO) and can leads to self comparison with peers and “influencers.”**](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/social-media-use-increases-depression-and-loneliness) Influencers on social media tend to flaunt a life-style that many of us wish we could have. The thing is, a [**large portion of the glam-life portrayed on social media is fake**](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/12/influencers-are-faking-brand-deals/578401/) and done for clout.

## Cook a healthy meal

There are tons of benefits to cooking healthy meals including improved sleep and focus. Eating low-carb meals can help [**reduce appetite and promote weight-loss**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12430970/), according to numerous studies. Also, [**Ketogenic diets**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet) have even been used to [**treat epilepsy in children who don’t respond well to medication**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1474442208700929). Once you start cooking, you realize [**a ton of meals can be done in 10 minutes or less**](https://www.thekitchn.com/10-minute-dinners-22932001), and only require 1 pan so easy cleanup. My go-to 10 minute meal is shrimp and broccoli.

## Do a 10-minute workout

A study published in the journal [**Plos One showed that short but intense workouts could be as beneficial as long workouts for maintaining health**](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0154075). The study looked at 3 groups of sedentary men. The control group made no changes to their habits. The other two groups were made to exercise. One group did a moderate cycling routine lasting 50 minutes while the last group did a 10 minute cycling routine that included intermittent 20 second bursts of maximum intensity cycling. The study concluded that [**high-intensity interval training**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training) may result in similar or superior improvements in multiple aspects of health.

If you don’t have workout equipment, there are [**tons of online resources that explain how to do body-weight workouts**](https://www.google.com/search?q=body+weight+workouts) consisting of things like deep squats, planks and pushups. I keep a 15lb, 20lb and 25lb kettlebell in my home office and love to do some curls and kettlebell swings before zoom meetings to get my blood flowing and reduce my anxiety.

I grew up with my parents and my brother. My parents were constantly fighting, my dad cheated on my mom and left us for a new family. My mom was emotionally distant and we didnt get along. My brother moved out and i was basically alone in my room the whole time. School was terrible and i didnt had a lot of friends. I created kind of a false reality in my mind when i was 11 where i pictured myself as a teenager/ young adult having fun, lots of friends and having a good time. It was the only thing ive ever thought about. School got so bad that i moved across the country to my dad and his new girlfriend and her family when i was 12. I left my mom alone and i still hate myself for that. But i was obsessed with starting over. Things kind of got better, i made a few friends but my mental health stayed the same. I lived there for 8 years. Im 20 now and i moved back to the city i grew up in. My mom moved to another country, i barely see her. We have a good relationship now tho. I think about the past a lot. I would give everything i have to relive my childhood. I cant move on i cant deal with the fact im never gonna be a child again. A month ago i drove to the house i used to live with my parents. I was so disturbed. I want to go back in time so bad. I know its normal to miss the childhood but i constantly think about it, thats not normal anymore. It just gets worse the older i get. I tried to watch a video a few weeks ago about a family vacation and i felt like throwing up the whole time. When i hear songs that remind me of my childhood i burst out in tears.

I feel worthless. Like the scum of the earth. I can’t hold down a part time job. I sleep a lot (even before surgery) and just spend my days alone in my apartment crying and tv and eating.

274,"Hey guys, first time posting, and idk if this fits here but I also don’t know where else it would fit. I’m 18 and have recently been under quite a lot of stress, I won’t go into too many specifics but, a combination of the whole pandemic with my family being at risk and my long time girlfriend involuntarily going to in person school has cause enough stress, but I also recently got into a car accident that totaled my car and took my out of a job until possibly February or later, and planning to move into an apartment soon and EOC haven’t necessarily helped. And recently my gf was wonder if two of her friends could move in as well, and everybody planning to move in had a conversation, we decided no, but for some reason the conversation gave me a bunch of stress and anxiety, I felt like puking as I was walking to my bed, but I didn’t make it there an collapsed on the floor and tried some deep breaths, but eventually I payed down on the floor.

275,"I hate that I just can't cut it enough in life. Always reminded im just barely passing. Smart enough to pass the border, but not enough to make it to the other side.  I can't stand this... I always feel like ill make it but I never do... I get so many opportunities, but I just don't have what it takes.... im good at everything i do, but im bad at it in the eyes of others.

I feel i work as hard as i can, but its never enough. Im never recognized or respected. Just a placeholder. Or a test or time passing....

Ever since I can remember... highschool 50s,50s 50s.... College... failing, 50s failing 50s. It took my 4 years to get a 2 year diploma. 

I never succeed in relationships.... 

First serious ... she cheated. 

2nd serious... she cheated. 

3rd serious... just a test to see how her family would react to her dating someone like me.... It boggles my mind. How am I to get along with her racist father when he says racially cruel things? I never disrespected him and I always respectfully shook his hand and greet him when hes around, but how can i be comfortable and be talkative to someone like him? But.. because i wasn't she needed to break up. Them or me.... 

4th... I ended up catching clawymeidia. I know I don't cheat so how did I get it... turns out.. she had it in her throat and she had no symptoms but it happened during our ""on and off"" break ups that never last longer than a week. I never had unprotected sex with her other than oral and even when asking if she slept with anyone on her forced ""break ups"" she says no.... after coming clean... its not my business to know her sex life. 

5th... placement.. holder. Why plan to date someone knowing you will leave to work overseas? WHy promise it will work knowing it wont.  Why do I have to follow her overseas? I can't... I don't have a job, how am I going to pay for my bills ? But she promised it will be for the best... i wont get a job thats ground breaking so i might as well come.... i can't. She couldn't afford to go either. So i used my savings and credit card and raked up 15k to help her..... eventually the distance and time apart made ehr realize she can't do long distance.....Breaks up with me this august. The most crippliong thing about it is I felt she was my everything. I was never more attracted to anyone than her, but I wasn't important to her. She even shown it... she would try to hard to be a good friend to strangers, but so mean and rough to me. I know its better for me to be seperated, but I wish she valued me as i did her. 

6th... shes the best thing that happened to me she kind and sweet, but the more she tries to help me and support me I get less and less attracted i am to her. I don't even share these things with her, my mom does against my wishes... and the more she tris to ""support me"" i get more repulsed and disgusted...at myself when I reflect at my past and a bit annoyed to be reminded of it by her. 

finally found a potentially great job. I been out of work since last year... Best I coud ever imagine. Im just not qualified... well learning im not. THe agreement request my education that is 2 years, but they want the 3 year one. I always mention on my resume im a technican. They seem to want technologist....The job ad said work  experience but.. ... not getting it now. Felt like a carrot has been dangled across my face.  On their defense they asked why haven't' i worked as a technologist, i told them its all the same the type of work i did is the same, but... last i heard of them.

always the C student..... im not suicidal or anything liek that, but I swear my issues feel real. Not as if its not happening, but like its a presesnce... that just sticks around me all the time. always sitting quietly and the closer it gets, i freak out. ... I can't even explain it, but sometimes when I reflect on it all, it feels overwhelming..

It is what it is but I just need to say it or yell it... I can talk about it to my mother but shes just always heads in the clouds. I can't even see her anymore becuase of the covid.  Most of my closest friends don't talk to me anymore.... just a gf who i wish just acts as a gf and not a life coach.",18Dec2020,2
276,"Hello! I'm an MBA student and currently a full-time employee.. the department I belong to doesn't have enough man power so I have to work overtime almost everyday for 2-4 hours at most. I have a flexible schedule so I can go to work anytime so long it's within a time frame of not later than certain hours of the day. Due to overtime and habit of not following a consistent schedule it had affected my sleeping cycle. I can't sleep enough and properly. As a result, it also affected my spare time for studying/attending classes.

 I was stuck with my research class and in order to pass it I have to extend my time with the subject which on the other hand causes me to drop my next subject. Although, sometimes after work. I do still have few hours of idle time, but I can't concentrate well studying because I'm already exhausted at work, so I ended up just using my phone or relaxing my body before going to bed. 

I believe that these idle hours I should have studied instead so I could have catched up with my lessons but I did not. Is this laziness? I feel that I could have done better but honestly I'm really tired and I just wanted to rest although I can't sleep yet. I'm so stressed of having a dropped subject in my MBA.

Northern Ireland will be going into a full lockdown from December 26th until February, so I’ll be spending my 25th birthday alone in my flat. I’ve always hated my birthdays, and I had decided years ago that I would take myself to Disneyland for my 25th, as I know it is the only thing that would make me happy for the occasion.

278,"So I've never been formally been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder but have always matched up with the diagnostic criteria. Extreme polarity in mood, going from outgoing and loving to completely distristing and hateful of people. This has caused me to lose a lot of friends in the process.

I've been with my current girlfriend 6 months. She is awesome and extremely attentive. In addition to BPD I also have extreme fear around infidelity. Recently I've noticed little things like my GF liking other guys FB and IG posts (including her ex) and her talking to other guys on Snap (people she has had sexual relations with).

The infidelity anxiety and BPD mixed together have caused me to become extremely resentful and angry of my girlfriend. This has manifested in me being very cold and distant, unresponsive, unavaliable. Part of me wants to confronting her directly about the aforementioned, but am worried about whether I am justified in my feelings or are they simply a symptom of my skewed mental distortions / mental illness. I also worry about addrressing these behaviours and her seeing me as paranoid / clingy and in effect unattracted to me.

Advice and thoughts very much appreciated.",18Dec2020,3
279," I work in union construction and I feel like I reached a dead end at my current employer.  I have been with them for the past 6 years and it seams like the longer I stay with them the worse they treat me. I think they figure that I’m less likely to move on as someone new. They are also really cheap when it comes to providing tools often buying cheap off brand power tools. Today I had to drill some holes in a tight area with one of there cheap drills and it only has 2 settings, off or 100% power. Well the drill bit caught and spun the battery into the side of my face. So now my face hurts and they probably have no work scheduled for the next two weeks.  I think I need to muster up the courage and find a new employer.",18Dec2020,3
280,"I am writing this on my main nick, since I don't even care anymore.

I think I just busted my dad on cheating. He was texting on Whatsapp and I saw heart emojis from both and a womans name (think I know the woman). My dad never ever sends heart emojis to anyone and this shocked me.

First I thought that I will have a panic attack, but then after I left to drive back home, it did go to this huge anger.

I know how it feels to be cheated and I don't want anyone to go through that. Now that I think of it, my dad is just like my ex. Jealous when my mom even wants to hangout with her sisters and really secretive of his phone.

Now I just have this brick on my chest that prevents me from breathing normally and I can't stop thinking about this....... Me and my little brother have already moved out, but youngest one still lives home.

I am thinking that should I confront my dad about this or just forget the whole thing.... Maybe talk about this to my psycholigst first...

Everything is already falling apart in my mind and now this. I know that things have not been so well with my parents for quite some time, but if you are starting to fall in love with someone else, you should divorce. They have been together for 30 years after all.

Just ranting, feeling so anxious....",18Dec2020,3

What do you think causes Musical Paralysis ? By that I mean that you stop listening to new songs and stick to the ones you listened to all your life ?
No more do I discuss music with my peers but they still do. I read that this happens when you’re around 30 but I’m 19 and since I was 17 I stumbled upon the hits from my childhood and I rarely ever listen to any new songs. I feel like nostalgia has a big part in this as it evokes so much memories.

Hi all,

Long time lurker here. But i thought id just make a post. Going through a rough patch for more than a year now. New job, family, rejection by someone i liked etc. basically everything.

Im 30 and Ive been trying to go get help, talk to therapist for 6 months now but always something comes up at work and i just get busy. Here’s the thing, im pretty good at my work but my heart and mind isn’t in it. Im a consultant for one of the biggest consulting firms in the world and ive been here 6 months and yet, part of me is already tired. 

The same with family. Im an immigrant With ties to family especially if you’re someone from south asia. Leaving them a big no. But i do want to move away. Its just that ive aging parents and siblings still in college. So basically i am their source of income per say. Also, ive an okay-relationship with them. Not the best but i wish it was better.

And then ive been rejected by someone I really liked. So I suppose ive no idea, whay exactly that is causing me so much anguish but I really really want to move away. Just away from it all. New work, new city, new people amd just start over. Is it worth it? I cant seem to answer that.

Or just get help and hope everything gets better?",18Dec2020,6
283,"For years, I have had issues with depression and anxiety.. It wasn’t spotlighted, until I ate a bottle of pills and nearly drank myself to death one day when I was 14. I have suffered from PTSD nearly my whole life, due to some sexual trauma done on me at a very early age.. I will spare the details. 

When I tried killing myself, I was diagnosed with ADD depression and anxiety, then given some drugs and went home. Like most kids that age, I was misdiagnosed and also wasn’t forced to keep up with my medications and therapy, that’s Ironic, since my mom was a psych nurse for over 20 years. I stopped treatment and did what I wanted, until this year (nearly 11 years later) because I just snapped. 

I have had emotional issues and temper issues for a long time, but not to the degree that I do now. When I say I snapped, I snapped. And knowing how uncontrollable that is terrifies me. 
It was like what having a fucking brain aneurysm must feel like.. one minute I’m my old nutty, quirky self.. working a 40 hr a week job, to loosing that job, becoming a hot pool of emotions, irrational behavior and aggression. The pandemic amplified my instability so much so that I was Locked in psych wards twice this year for suicidal behavior and reoccurring psychotic episodes. Since then, I’ve been diagnosed with BPD,PTSD, depression, anxiety, bipolar and more recently.. depression with reoccurring psychosis, or severe schitzoaffective disorder 

To fast forward for everyone, I’ll go to present day.. current day, I’m on 4 medications, trying to fight for social security benefits and a constant burden on my husband. 
We were recently married, after 4 years of being together.. this was before I progressed. 
I still have so much trouble keeping my shit together some days. I wake up angry every day with no one to be angry at. I take my hostility out on the most loving person I’ve ever had in my life.. he doesn’t deserve my shit. I don’t deserve him, we have been on the brink of separation already.. 

I wouldn’t wish for my worst enemy to be in my mind for even a minute. I wouldn’t wish mental illness on anyone. 
I hold an unexplainable self loathing that pours over on to the ones I love. I wake up almost every day with my husband smiling in my face, basically pleading for a good morning with me, just to give him the cold shoulder and a mean attitude. I wish I could crawl out of my skin and be anyone else. I feel like a terrible person all the time and honestly I deserve it, because I make my husband feel like shit. He could have anyone else and he still lets me stay.. 

I’m honestly at a huge roadblock since I’ve started recovery.. I still blame my problems on the world, I still hate myself and I’m still fucking my marriage up with my shit. Pills and Therapy only does so much. I take mood stabilizers, anti depressants and an antipsychotics just to function on a daily basis now. I take enough drugs to kill an elephant. 
I wouldn’t have thought even 5 years ago that this would be where I would end up. 

I have come to the conclusion, that if I do loose my marriage and whatever is left of my mind that I deserve it. I’ve done this to myself. I’ve allowed it to get this bad... 

I hear of some awesome success stories, of people recovering from bpd.. but having the severity of underlying mental problems on top of it, Im scared shitless every day that it won’t get better, that I won’t improve fully.. that he will finally walk away and leave me on my own. The future never scared me until now. I’m very use to loss..",18Dec2020,2
284,So I’m currently living in a city that’s seen a drastic increase in violent crime and just over a week ago was caught in the middle of the 6th shooting outside my house and the second I saw in person. It’s not been easy for me in my life from growing up in a poor and abusive home in the south as gay boy to watching my own brother die at 11 to my parents divorce leaving me alone at 16 with no help then my best friend dying the same way as my brother at 17 to just one abusive relationship after another. It’s been a really rough life and I try to stay positive but over the last few months I have literally pulled away from everyone and I am starting up therapy sessions starting tomorrow as I know I won’t be able to deal with everything alone. Has anyone else experienced these types of traumas in life or has any insight on how to handle the high anxiety and crippling depression. Where I am currently there is no real community that I can trust as there’s far to many that have overly inflated self images and they will sell you out and stab you in the back in a heartbeat to feel some type of entertainment to stay relevant in the community. I will be leaving the area soon and moving to a new city but while I’m here I can’t help but feel severe levels of anxiety just leaving my house,18Dec2020,3
285,Look i just made this account cuase i don't want my friend to see this but i think theres someome in my head like they can hear my thoughts and see through my eyes and its been a while now and I feel like its changing me how I think and how i talk my friends have told me I have changed a bit but idunno i couldn't find any good answers on google so please just tell me whats going on i cuase i dunno im guessing like its some sort of mental illness,18Dec2020,1

287,"There is always a part of me that is detached from how I'm actually feeling, it's always analysing. It makes me feel like I'm lying to myself. When I feel awful and dont want to do anything or feel anxious, it's always, in a way cheering these feelings on,  like I want to feel horrible. No matter what, it's there and I want it to stop I want it to go away I want feel properly.

288,"Hello everyone, I’m in a sort of dire situation and I just need support and help. I (19M) used to have an issue with self-harm when I was about my sister’s (12 years old) age and I’ve been absolutely terrified that she would pick it up from me or end up in the same situation. Well, a couple days ago I found out that she IS in the same situation. My mum found out by accident when she was having blood work done because she is very underweight. I talked to her about it and she also admitted to having struggled with an eating disorder, which I also have since I was her age and still do. I’m terrified it’s my fault that she’s doing what she’s doing to herself, that she may have gotten the idea from me. I live abroad (24 hours of travel by car, 12 by plane + bus) and part of me feels insanely guilty for travelling home soon because I’m literally the only person my sister confides in. She’d never told a soul about her ED before she told me. She sees a psychologist but refuses to tell her about any of her struggles other than her social anxiety. The feeling of guilt is overwhelming for me and it’s exhausting, I struggle carrying on with my everyday life, which is very much full of school, work and other things. Have any of you had a sibling with a self-harming issue? How did you deal with it? How can I best help her? It’s odd that I’m at a total loss of what to say and do when I also struggled with it so badly at her age. I just need to find a way to cope and support her at the same time, and it’s feeling more or less impossible to find that balance.",18Dec2020,2

The world’s climate will raise to an unbearable temperature while I am still alive. Our favorite restaurants and businesses we grew up will and are closing. With climate change, we don’t even have that long to live, I’m twenty and I probably won’t die from natural causes/old age. Speaking of, i don’t know what I want to do with my life which means idk what I want to do in school and aimlessly wandering absolutely sucks. I like to lay around and be sedentary. I don’t want to work for the rest of my life...it sounds miserable. This pandemic made me realize we could all die at any given moment. I guess I say all this to say, I don’t enjoy life or the prospect of living. It’s exhausting. I’m tired of taking care of myself. I’m tired of caring for others all the time. I’m tired of constantly working to support myself, and I have a fun, easy-going job. Should I just do heroin and get sick until I die lol? Is life worth it for those of us that think of life like this?",18Dec2020,1
290,I don't want to get into what I did and I don't even know if the person I did it to cares at all or ever did. It wasn't anything malicious or anything illegal. I'm sorry this is really vague I'm just not comfortable sharing it with a bunch of internet strangers. I just want to know if you guys have any steps for self forgiveness or ways to potentially stop self loathing and finding reasons to hate yourself for things you've done in the past? any things welcome :),18Dec2020,2

In a group of people where everyone's complimenting each other or talking to each other they'll just look at me and avoid me? Why do I make situations so dreadful and my existence is nothing.

294,"So Long story short I’ve been very stressed lately for lots of reasons. School, covid, life... just everything. I always get random thoughts like „you should just end it all“ even though i don’t really think I’m suicidal. I used to be a couple of years ago but now i don’t really wanna kill myself. It’s more like i get these thoughts everytime something goes wrong and they make me actually think about it. It’s honestly so dramatic a lot of the time. I could just run out of coffee or something (which is frustrating but not that bad) and my brain goes „yeah just kill yourself“
Why is this happening to me? It’s literally so annoying... how can i stop it? Does it happen to anyone else?",18Dec2020,4
