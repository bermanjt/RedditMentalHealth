1,"(16M) Some info about why I'm making this post - I at the age of 11 tried to commit suicide and failed. I was forced to see a psychiatrist to check on my mental well-being which I said to I was fine and I had no more bad thoughts till I didn't need to see them anymore. Now after 5 years of pent up frustration of me thinking over and over if I should do it or not.

I have a gambling addiction where I have lost a ton of money where I selfharm everytime I lose, like bashing my head in a concrete wall until I bleed. I don't trust my current ""friends"" because it feels like they are around me for money and they wouldn't care if I died and the old ones who would've cared are sexist and racist pricks. (I also smoke, drink and use white portions which you can search up what they are.)

Everytime I am in my crammed apartment room and open my window I contemplate on jumping. 

The only reason I haven't done it is because I have a loving family which I know would be really sad about my death.

There is more but I don't feel like talking about it.

(The important thing is if I should seek help or not and keep hiding my feelings since I feel scared to be judged by people around me..) - My question I guess.

The reason why this feels so hard is because it might halt my studies, make home life harder and I guess the chance of making everything feel worse.

I have never taken any I guess ""mental"" medication or what you call it and I want to avoid that since I want to feel clear in my mind and not feel unsure or foggy.",17Oct2020,1
2,"I get so stressed out over everything, even minor things. I always feel like everyone is judging me, and that every day I prove myself to be even more stupid.

I’m finding it harder to cope. I worry about so much, and now my thoughts seem to always go to ending it. It brings me comfort in a way, knowing that the pain of being here could stop. Yet, I could never actually do it. So I’m trapped dealing with it. I’m dreading going back to work Monday because of dumb minor worries. I’m struggling to do college work tonight, that’s due in a few hours. 

I feel like nobody around me cares. I’m too scared to say anything about how I feel inside, but I also want people to realize that I’m struggling. I feel like I have nobody to turn to. I so tired of going through this.",17Oct2020,1
3,"I’ll start by saying im not depressed. And I never have been. And i never have these thoughts when im sad. I don’t know when exactly this started, at least 3 years ago. I will often see a knife and go through what it would look like (in my mind) if i stabbed my self in the mouth, stomach, etc. I put myself in third person and just think about what it would look like, who would see the scene first, the aftermath. Another example is when im on a tall building i will go through the same thoughts but with me falling off the building. These are just some examples.. I will also go over scenarios that have happened to me in the past such as being stabbed. From my general knowledge of mental health this seems like PTSD and anxiety i just want someone’s opinion that has experience/more knowledge.",17Oct2020,1
4,Anyone else feels extremely in tune with this song? Sometimes I don’t want to let go of pain because it makes my experience so special...,17Oct2020,1

This may sound strange but I will do my best to explain the story to you.

2 years ago, I lived what I will call in this story ""the good period"" This period lasted about 5 months and if it marked me so much it is because I discovered during this period all the things that I like today and especially because I had a good entourage, I was in my universe and nobody made me shit. To try to illustrate ""the right period"" I will describe some typical tricks of this period

\-I had a world on minecraft that I liked a lot and I spent hours building on it.

\-I was building for a minecraft server (which closed down in the process)

\-I was a trainee in a restaurant with super nice people.

\-I was playing a list of specific video games that I will not quote because I am lazy.

\-I had rgb leds on my desk

\-I was on specific discords servers

\-And I discovered a lot of video games that I still love as much as ever

Now you who are reading this text are going to say to yourselves ""where is the problem? It just looks like the text of an asshole who feels nostalgic"" Well it's not as rosy as that. Indeed for the past year and a half I've been obsessed with re-creating this period of my life like a psychopath trying to find a pretty girl he met on the street, basically:

\-I'm trying to put everything on my desk as it was at that time (thanks to the few pictures I took).

\-I'm trying to redo an internship in the restaurant where I did my internship 2 years ago.

\-I created a playlist of the music I was listening to during the right period of time.

\-I force myself to play the same games I was playing during this period.

\-I got back in touch with people I haven't spoken to in 2 years.

\-I have created fakes accounts to see my messages from the right period on discords servers on which I have been banned.

\-I put on the clothes I was wearing during that period to feel like I was at that time.

\-I handed over the profile pictures I had at that time.

So even if I take some pleasure in doing this it starts to eat me up inside and I feel like I'm going fucking crazy, I'm trying to find lost emotions because my life has changed a lot in the meantime (I'm not in the same school as before, I don't have the same hobbies as I used to have at that time, I almost don't see the people I was dating during the good period) Anyway. And it goes even further into madness, watching the twitch streamers I was watching at that time, putting my skin minecraft back as it was before and even forcing me to not like some things I didn't know during the good period, in class I only think about re-creating this period of my life, there's not a day when I don't think about that and I'm starting to be afraid of myself.

This situation is really special, I don't think I'm the only one on this subreddit to have talked about something like that, if you know someone who is going through the same thing as me or if you have experienced it yourself I would like to have your opinion on this """"""""""obsessions"""""""""".Thank you for taking the time to read!

7,I need help. Any advice would be amazing. I get way to worked up about mistakes and I’ve never known my identity as anything other than a hard working employee or student. It’s destroying me at this point. Please help.,17Oct2020,1
8,"Honestly I just feel like venting. Life just feel like a load right now and sometimes my mind just go into a depression state that I try to quickly snap out of. Luckily my mind is that strong. It’s crazy how tough life is, and what makes it crazier is the fact that I have so much more of life to live. It bothers me knowing that life has so much hard times in it. I just wish i could avoid it all. I know most of it is for learning purposes but damn can’t I learn a different way? I’ll be fine though. After writing that last sentence I chuckled a bit and for some reason it knocked out the negative energy. Overall It sucks that life is this way sometimes but God knows why He made life this way. So I’m not gonna bash His creation because at the end of the day it will be beneficial for me.  Hope you guys enjoyed your day and I pray you can see the light at the end of your tunnel.",17Oct2020,1
9,"I’ve been taking a cymbalta/bupropion combo since about February along with hydroxyzine for sleep. While this has generally worked to keep my anxiety levels from work/ school/ a LDR and managing adulthood, I’ve felt more and more lately that it almost works too well. I find myself not as worried about deadlines or punctuality to the point where I will just not stress at all. That is, until right beforehand where I feel the pressure piled up and BAM full on panic attack. I’ve also noticed it’s affected my personality in not so great ways. I’ve made some poor life decisions lately and now that they’ve built up and I’m looking at the consequences, I feel the panic again. I’ve considered the apathetic times are depression disguising itself, but I’ve generally never had issues with depression...

I guess this is part question, part asking for support, but has anyone else experienced this kind of thing? What did you do to address it? Thanks in advance!",17Oct2020,1
10,"Hi all,

I’m usually a lurker on reddit so forgive me if the format of this post is wrong but I need some advice.

I’m easily irritable, I have been for as long as I can remember and I have a tendency to snap at friends and loved ones in a ridiculously overreacted fashion.

For example, my long term girlfriend may repeatedly ask me something  I’ve already answered and I respond with an aggressive “I told you this already blah blah”, even with the most light hearted question that doesn’t even matter and would be forgotten in moments.

Playing video games with friends, a lot of the time it’s great fun and I enjoy the experience but when things don’t go to plan, I hate it and my mood turns sour in a heartbeat, often resulting in anger bubbling out of control and essentially soiling the mood, but I love playing and hanging out with these friends.

Why am I like this? I consider myself as very happy in life. I suffered from depression in the past, though I believe this was situational as I was struggling to get a job in my desired career,  and was struggling financially but my amazing girlfriend helped me through those times and I’m now in a well paying job that I love and I live comfortably, so I can’t understand why I’m so irritable.

I try to pursue calming hobbies, I’ve recently taken up drawing and i work on coding projects in my spare time. 

It feels like I constantly have this pool of anger that’s ready to boil over the edge at the drop of a pin, but that’s not me, I love a good joke and I care deeply about my loved ones. I want to take life easy and love each moment , but this well of rage sours it.

Why is this a thing? It makes no sense to me.

11,"For my whole life there’s been a little voice (not like an external voice just a part of my subconscious) in my head telling me I was better than others. It would insult even the people I most care about to an extent I would never even consider. People I think only good things of, will be reduced to slurs for a second before I can get my thoughts under control, not to mention the constant reminders of my high IQ, and the way the little voice tells me that because of it it’s ok that I’m rude or sometimes an outright dick to people. If I were to say the things the come to my head out loud I would very quickly be labeled as a narcissist. The problem is things have been getting much worse recently. I can hardly stop myself from saying these things out loud and hurting people I love. 

Tl;dr I have a little voice in my head that’s a dick and it’s been much harder to contain recently",17Oct2020,1
12,I can't fathom people feeling things like they are meant to be felt. Any time I do anything I am almost always underwhelmed. I am incapable of feeling anything at the same level as everyone around me. Are those people just faking the enthusiasm? Or am I just incapable of feeling that type of emotion? I've seen several psychologists/psychiatrists but like.. No one has any good advice to help me FEEL things. I got married and it was just another day to me. My mother died and I couldn't shed a tear. How do I start feeling? I would like to feel like a human,17Oct2020,1
13,"Is it normal to have a conversation with “your self”, while imagining youre talking to a friend as if they were there with you ?  
So ive been doing this for a long time, But when I’m alone I talk to my self but I’m imagining having a conversation with someone I actually know in real life. 
So for example if something happens in my day that I would usually tell a friend, sometimes I’ll go in front of the mirror (imagining looking at myself talk from my friends pov) and tell my friend about something that happened recently or just anything I feel like talking about. 
Then other times I don’t go in front of the mirror and I just imagine theyre in the room w me and I’m talking to them. And sometimes when I’m cleaning my room I’ll imagine my friend is in there w me and I’m talking to them. 
Just to be clear, I don’t imagine fictional people, it’s always people I actually know that I imagine, but I’ve never had many friends and the few friends I have are guys and I don’t always feel like opening up to them about everything in real life so instead I imagine having the conversation. 
Is this normal?
I also notice I kind of whisper when “talking to them”, like my mouth moves and a little of my voice comes out, so like I’m just talking real quiet",17Oct2020,1
14,"I just went through something very emotionally painful between myself and my partner. Long story short he was very drunk and said and did many things that hurt me (nothing physical nor in a manipulative or abusive manner)

15,"I'm currently having to do therapy as a requirement for my college course. I'm also having a hard time though. Being still is very hard, laying in bed trying to sleep is the worst part of every day, focus is very hard too. My mind is racing, I feel very overwhelmed. My therapist suggested meditation. Now I've meditated a lot in my life and those meditative states have felt useful and relieving. I know meditation is broad, and many things can count, even going for a walk. At the moment however, because of how my mind seems to be I'm finding it very very stressful to try to meditate, I'm in a constant state of stress. The therapist seems sure mediation will help, to the point where she wouldn't let me say, 'I'll try', she said ""no, you will"". I get it, she's trying to be positive, and I understand that things are very unlikely to improve if you don't believe they will, etc etc, and if you don't try to give yourself a break. Right now though, trying to meditate puts me in a worse state than before. I'm already trying to think of counter arguments to negative views, even if I'm really struggling to believe them, I am actively trying to improve my mental state.

Ive heard a few people say that there's no such thing as not being able to meditate, that all things can be meditation. If all things truly can be meditation, that kind of suggests existing is meditation. I'm talking about the actual act of being in a state of flow or at peace though. A few people have felt I was wrong in the past for suggesting I couldn't meditate at various points. Like I said there have been times I found meditation helpful. Is there a chance the people who don't believe that it is sometimes hard or impossible or not helpful for some people to meditate at some points just don't know how it feels to the people who sometimes cant?

Am I not allowed to be having a hard time but be working on it without it being suggested I'm not trying to feel better if I don't feel I can meditate? I have a history of severe self harm, I feel like there's a genuine thing, that internalising and trying to slow down sometimes isn't possible, sometimes people need release in a more forceful manner? Sometimes people feel things really strongly physically and thinking doesn't always suddenly erase it? Or at least not quickly enough to stop the feeling being excruciating? I can go day by day trying to think things through and improve my mental state, but right now doing that in the form of 'meditating' doesn't feel right. I am working on it, the fact I'm not happy and carefree right now is not because I'm not trying hard enough, it's because I need a bit more time to analyse what's going on and get my head round it so I can change it. 

Surely people aren't calling any type of thought meditation?",17Oct2020,1
16,"Everything seems to set me off. Seeing people so happy with their new car. Seeing people with friends. Seeing people with a popular YouTube channel. Commericals and advertisements that torture the metaphoric soul. Seeing rude customers demand for their coffee or food. Finding out about how shitty 3rd world countries can be. Seeing people with their happy lives in happy homes that they think they so well deserved because they have a job. Knowing so many people have good lives at the expense of the exploitation of others. Capitalism. Seeing how politics is nothing but a game, using the masses as pawns, resulting in everyone tearing each other apart who have different politics. Other people work just as hard, if not, then even harder, and tons of people are struggling, not just struggling externally, but internally as well. Today there is still slavery, rape, murder. That chocolate bar you ate the other day? Probably from a cocoa bean picked by a black kid in africa, being paid less than a dollar so American companies can save money. Having Nike be the shoe brand to make you popular at school, even though their made from child labor in sweatshops in China. Watching the planet being destroyed by human caused climate change, and having so many people in denial or not caring. People born with deformations or other problems. Stupid mother fuckers that will feed cats when their away from home, so that the cat will forget to go back home and be lost. Animal abusers. Factory farms where animals are fed to obesity and never see the light of day so we can have McDonald's. People shooting any stranger because of a little argument. Toxic masculinity and homophobia. Making friends with people who have social status to increase your own social status. Flint still has led in their water, and nothing is getting done. So many religions claiming to unite but they only cause violence and division. No one taking a pandemic seriously. It's all just a constant struggle of suffering and feeding off of each other. There's more, there's always more, but now it's time to talk about my problems.

My hearing is sensitive(some where on the ASD spectrum) every little sound, the sound of forks hitting the dish plates, the sound of people walking around, people in my house constantly coughing, other people playing music(I know there's nothing wrong with music) dogs every where in the neighborhood including my own, barking 24/7. People gossiping annoyingly on the phone. These things will cause me to have a melt down. I have no control when the anger fills me until I can't be filled anymore with anger, it needs to vent somewhere physically. Bipolar depression. Times where I want to help everyone I know and try to improve the world, and then times where I want to kill everyone, exhausting my mind with negative thoughts, tiring myself where I could sleep forever but yet it's impossible to sleep for more than an hour or two at a time. All the times of being bullied through school. Isolating my self for so long, I think my personalities split from each other, letting me have long abusive conversations with myself, having my others selves talk to me to put me down. I'm fucking spoiled. I have a job and I live with my parents. I have videogames and I have the privilege to sit on my ass to enjoy videogames, while other people around the world have lives 100 times shittier than mine. None of these things belong to me, I don't deserve luxuries. I don't even deserve my body, my body doesn't belong to me. Why should I get to enjoy it? Why don't I just kill myself if I hate everything? Probably because that takes a lot of strength, something I don't have. I don't want someone seeing the dead body that was never mine to begin with. I read the description of the sub. It said I was allowed to vent, yet I'm still not satisfied, we are never satisfied. I can understand why people creating art is a better vent than writing because sometimes there are no words to describe how you feel. You can never understand anyone, and no one will ever understand you. Words and language are a secondary source of information of what someone is really thinking. You are the only one with your thoughts. You are truly alone, no matter how many people you surround yourself by, everything is in your head, only you can know what is in your head. Like I said, those thoughts aren't even your thoughts. Did you really create the thoughts in your head for the brilliant ideas you dare take credit for? Go fuck yourself.",17Oct2020,1

I can be alone at home and I just feel like there’s cameras everywhere, that I have no privacy anywhere I go. Like there isn’t cameras in my house but I just have this feeling they are watching me. And by they I don’t know who just someone is out to get me. Especially when I go out in public I feel like everyone is staring at me and watching and judging my every move. I know that sounds crazy but I swear it’s driving me crazy and nobody believes me. Whoever “they” are they’re getting in my head and they’re telling me what I cannot and can do. I don’t know what they want from me, but I think they’re trying to make me go crazy.

Nobody believes me, I’ve tried to talk to my boyfriend about how I feel and how I swear there’s cameras around me at all times but he said I’m just overthinking and stressed but I just know someone is watching me.

Human traffickers, a psychotic man cornering me with ice pick, dangling from a ceiling, ODs just to wake up in the hospital still alive. I won’t die by my own hand, I’m aware of it. But I will die eventually. I want it and I want it to be on my terms. Yet still I keep throwing myself into danger to help people, to save them, to make a stand without ever causing injury to another and yet I keep fucking living. Burning in fires, getting shot, I won’t fucking die. At least I’d feel okay dying doing something I chose instead of tortured and raped and helpless in some manifestation of existential horror, of the tragedy that is to live the flux of the human condition just for your last moments to be nothing but fear and violations and empty loneliness with no one to comfort you while you’re made to live through hell. But every fucking wound of trauma whether it was forced on me or sought out, I keep surviving, and with every one I feel alienated. My entire life has been either an active tempest of hellish experience that makes you wish to have never lived, to stand on the edge of death in a way you sickeningly know that so many actually spent the last moments of their existence, or throwing myself in damaging danger just to still be here, when I would have welcome death if it could have meant something, save someone from hurt but release me from this god damn weight all at once. I don’t want to live. I’ve stood in front of 50 cal anti infantry guns, taken beatings, bled, felt my body break and I keep craving it. I’m done with being alive. I have no interest in being alive. But my death needs to be my catharsis. Dying in the hands of some inhuman sadist fucking sucks. Dying alone by my own hand sucks. It’s fucked up that I’m still here and have to live with what it feels like to face that empty damn void like that.

21,"I (15F) have a sister in middle school who I think has anorexia or is developing it and I'm really scared for her. We're not very close but I really do care about her and I'm really worried. She had been overweight for the past 3 years or so, but has recently been losing a lot of weight (she's in the healthy weight range now) really quickly since quarantine started. Now this normally wouldn't be much cause for concern, but she's been saying that she's been ""starving herself"" for over 12 hours at a time. In the hours that she does eat, she's been eating really unhealthy processed foods and sweets. She doesn't seem to think it's a problem - she always seems extremely proud when she says that she hasn't eaten since \[insert time here\] or lost \[some amount\] of weight.

I talked to my mom about this today and she seems to understand kind of what I'm saying, but not really. My parents are immigrants from a country where mental illnesses aren't a big deal. It's just something that people deal with themselves or with very close family and only the most serious cases get taken with a doctor (the same is true for physical illnesses so it's not just some conservative mindset or anything.) However, I don't think my sister is as strong-willed and I'm really worried that she'll do something. When I told my mom, she said something along the lines of how my sister's always been like this in a way. She said that when my sister was a baby and she would hold her, she could feel that she (my sister) felt very alone. Like she was ""the only one in the world."" My mom told me that I couldn't fully understand what it felt like and even started getting a bit choked up.

I think this is my fault. I've been suicidal for a bit over 1 1/2 years now (please don't give me sympathy in the comments tho) and nearly attempted a once or twice, and I used to get into these state of minds very frequently (it's a lot less now) where I'd just hurt (emotionally) everyone around me. My sister is a very caring person and she can always tell when someone is upset and try to help, so she would and I'd get upset and essentially just give her generosity a cold shoulder. I think this greatly contributed to her feeling alone and isolated and this is my fault. Then I start thinking about killing myself and all that stuff cuz this would not have happened if I weren't here and all that stuff, but then it's also jsut outright selfish to think about *myself* when this is about my sister. But then this makes it so that I can't think about this logically. I want to cut myself or soemting but then that's making it about me if my mom sees it (which I think she has before) when I don't want htem to be worried about *me,* but I need them to care mroe about my sister. I feel like I *need* to do it but i'm too scared to and now my head's just all filled up since I can't release it and it feels like it's about to explode.

The last few months have been hard starting with my father up and leaving his job at the very start of quaratine and being unemployed ever since.

 Him being around triggered a mess of childhood trauma and i can't be around him for more than an hour without needing to leave the room. 

I pretty much hide in my bedroom if I'm not at work. 

So I try to work as much as possible and work as hard as possible. But work preformance means nothing and no matter how much I do work it still doesnt matter cause I still am forced to live at home.

Everyone seems to be having some happiness driving them. People are getting promoted, getting married, having children, adopting pets, travelling, or moving out and my life is just a mess.

All of this is building a ball of anger deep in my chest. I have thoughts of screaming and swearing and wishing to tell people how I really feel. But its impolite to share my feelings like that. Its wrong to scream. Its wrong to throw fits so I have to just sit on my anger and hate.

I have no way of letting any of it out. I've tried literally everything to let my anger out. I've tried deep breathing, i've tried stress balls. Chances are if you think of it i've tried it.

So I end up cutting myself to try to control it and protect others. But even thats not enough. I want to scream and I want people to know how much pain im in. I have no way to let it out so im stuck with the baggage of this anger.

But his last bout of depression lasted weeks and has taken its toll on me. I am tired of having to be the rock. Tired of pick up the pieces and being the strong one. I want to YELL at him to just get over it and everyone has bad days and gets overwhelmed pressure from life and work.

28,"Two big problems here- one is feeling guilty for inanimate objects but I’m not a hoarder and still bin them, I feel extremely guilty nevertheless. I think it may be because I don’t use something and it never got to serve its purpose or something? I don’t know but I hate that feeling, I want to stop feeling bad for literal pieces of plastic. 

The other is hoarding things with slight sentimental value. For example, stuffed animals I’ve had since I was little. I don’t want to donate them have have them thrown away by the charity shop, as silly as that sounds. Do I need stuffed animals at my age? No. But I hold an emotional attachment to them. I think it’s because my father really didn’t give two shits about me as a young child and when he paid attention to me it was negative, so the toys were comforting. I’ve got about nine or ten and can’t bring myself to donate any of them. I even feel guilt for putting them in a dark box. 

I’ve seen many articles and forum threads analysing this, but never actually offering a solution. Any guidance? I’m posting this in here because the sadness that ensued from thinking about parting with them led to subsequent mental breakdowns, which lead to me exhibiting the same symptoms of depression I did before I found an anti-depressant that seemed to work.",17Oct2020,1

32,"Whats the point in life if people are just going to treat you like your nothing. 2020 has been one of the worse years in my life. They say turning 13 is a big deal, and you should be happy about it. This year I have realized all the emotions turned up inside me and I can't even tell anyone I know. I realized how messed up life really is. How people are never going to respect you treat you like a actually person. That no matter what you do in this world, someone will hate you. That there will always be haters.

Idk, I just figured out how all my life I've been in pain and didn't really realize it. Just hiding it from myself and from other people. Now I'm just hiding it from the people closest to me. It's not like we were even close in the first place.

Whats the point in it all. Life is made on this structure. Go to school, get good grades, go to college, and get a job, then die at the end. And spend all your life paying off college loans. I don't get it. And in between, you have people treating you like trash the whole time. Never giving a heck about you. Your young you should be happy. You have a good life you should be happy. Is that how it should work.

I'm told everyday of how I'm lucky to have a middle class family. How many people have it worse then me. Does that mean that I'm justing imagining it all. That my feelings of pain aren't real or I'm not worthy of having pain and sadness. 

Just stop being sad they say. The magical cure for all. I wish that were true. That with one thing all the pain would be gone, and I could live my life. Sadly, it doesn't work like that, people like to believe it though. It just makes it worse. Like saying stop being stressed or there nothing to be stressed about, ever helps. Why do people even say that. Just makes me more stress.

35,"I have suffered from BPD for a very long time, I was sexually abused by someone early in my childhood. Sex became meaningless but the need always emerged even when I knew I would regret it later. I have used sex as a weapon and also as leverage to keep someone in my life. The crippling fear of anyone established in my life leaving me drives me into horrible habits of sleeping with someone just as a comfort that isn’t really a comfort because I feel just as empty as I started. Recently a trusted friend and confidant sexually assaulted me when I was drunk, I had drank an entire bottle of tequila and hardly conscious due to a horrible panic attack. I have since cut contact with the individual but even leaving that friendship has left me feeling like it was my fault that I couldn’t pull myself together enough. Like maybe I shouldn’t have drank that much then I wouldn’t have lost a friend.. I don’t want anyone to feel the way I do, I don’t want anyone to feel like they have to give themselves physically for people to stay or feel compelled to. I have a very fleeting sex drive as I only really feel sexual desire when I am having a manic episode which is not good for long term relationships as I cannot keep up with the demands my exes wanted. They would guilt trip me into doing it or yell at/hit me until I submit. I can’t stare at bare ceilings for very long because it would send me into panic as I used to just stare at the ceiling and go somewhere else mentally to distract from the pain. This abuse has caused me chronic pain due to a pelvic floor disorder which further dampens my willingness to be touched at all even just hugging. I can’t help but feel like this is all my fault and that I ruin everything because of my issues. I feel like it has made me unloveable and not capable of being cared about more than just my physical form. I don’t want anyone to relate to this..

Along with that, I can’t seem to remember anything from 2017 onwards. This makes sense because I went through pretty bad trauma and emotional abuse.

Why not add a course that teaches kids how to be good human being. Teach kids how to accept others for how they come. Teach kids how get out of bad situations and ask for help.

54,"Hi everyone, first time in this sub here! 

For starters i’ve really been struggling with the overall ambiance of the environment we live in. Here in the U.S. there’s lots of polarization going on. just to name a few, 

- politics 
- social issues 
- environmental dilemmas 

To get in specifics, like most - i personally have been unable to ignore the current political state of the U.S.  and i’m beginning to see it affect my personal life. More-so recently tonight, I had a pretty nasty dispute with my Aunt, whom my mom &amp; grandmother are very close with (my only family,  aside from my immediate brother &amp; sister). 

this dispute was about politics, and her views tend to tread more towards an extremist POV, particularly about people on welfare, and any gov’t assistance. This struck a chord with me for two reasons 

1. Since the pandemic i’ve been unemployed and collecting unemployment 

2. last year, for a full year i was an intern at homeless shelters and would facilitate group listening sessions with them to alleviate their stress and provide therapeutic intervention. i witnessed people who would work 40+ hours a a week, had no home, and still needed some type of gov’t assistance to put food on their table. 

So to get to the point; my aunts POV’s are very against helping the needy, or less fortunate. &amp; quite frankly the way she was talking about them was disgusting, and truly struck a chord with me to where i lashed out on her. i got really mean, and really hurtful. My mom and my grandma don’t seem to want to communicate with me now and my relationship with my aunt was pretty much Nuke’d by myself. 

I came home sobbing because along with being unemployed and struggling, now i fear my family has isolated themselves from me, or i’ve isolated myself from my family. i feel really alone, and have been through so much trauma over the past several years (my father killed himself three years ago), and i don’t know how to handle the growing mountain of stress, and nihilism.  I guess i’m just here to vent/get this sadness off my chest. i just spent the past two hours crying and i feel like my world is crumbling around me and it’s becoming increasingly more difficult to handle.

I decided to use them today even though today's been pretty bad, so around 20 minutes ago I cleaned my face with nice smelling face cleaner, put actual good quality lotion on that also smelled nice, put chapstick on, and brushed my teeth which I don't do often because I usually don't care enough to.

56,"Hi. I already posted this to another subreddit but I feel like I need to put this here too. I’m sorry if I over share. 

Like most people, I have fears. However, my fears are a little different than being afraid of a little spider. All my life all I wanted is to make everyone else happy. I laugh. I crack jokes. But if I find out someone has an unhappy emotion because of me, it kills me. To know that they are mad at me, or sad because of me. Or maybe I shared my feelings, and now they are worried about me. Then I become a burden. 

I am a High Functioning Autistic 19 year old Male. Some things are hard. I don’t always know the best thing to say, or what to do when certain things happen. I am not very good at regulating my emotions. If something is bothering me, I cant tell anyone. They will hate me or worry about me. I know because if they feel nothing, then they don’t care about me, snd that makes me exactly what my brain has been trying to tell me all along: that i’m worthlwss. 

Everytime something hurts me, I bury it deep down so no one has to know. I let it sit. Slowly killing me all this time. I wish someone will wrap their arms around me, hug me, and tell me that i’ll be ok while I cry on their shulder. 

I really wish, in times like this, that I had a significant other. Someone to share happiness with. Someone that I can grow with. And someone who will help me through this. But I don’t. Because I have this. I don’t want top pull anyone in. Besides, I would be too much work. Too much of a burden. I can’t approach anyone because I don’t want to make it awkward if they don’t like me back, and if I ever do get someone, she would most likely leave if I tell her. Even if she stays, there would be days where I would be dead weight. I can’t put that on anyone. 

I hate myself. Even people who know I go through things never see it in action. I’ve made sure about that. It’s hard enough telling them I have Anxiey. If they read this they might wirry about me. No one did this to me. I’ve grown up surrounded with love. This is my fault. My fault for feeling this way. Feeling inadequate, out of place, worthless, awkward, cringy, and not good enough.

Over the last couple of weeks, the best way I can describe how I'm feeling is that I haven't felt like myself - and I don't know why. I don't feel excited for things I would normally be excited about, I keep getting random low moods where speaking to people becomes frustrating. For example, yesterday I saw some of my best friends that I hadn't seen in a while - and about an hour into our interaction I felt my mood dip. Almost like my battery just died. I felt so overwhelmingly sad, for what feels like no reason.

I keep getting mad at my partner for no reason, and he hasn't done anything wrong, I seem like I don't want to be somewhere when I do. I feel flat and it's scary because I don't know why this is happening.

68,"Hi, 18M close to 19 here, I'll start with a little bit of background. I dated this girl that i met on an erasmus for almost a year. Thing is, it was 99% a ldr, and even if I visited her, it went all terribly wrong. Won't go much into details, but she played with my feelings and lied multiple times, lost feelings for me 2 months before me going and met another person and just wanted me to visit her to see if we kissed or something.

Well, not only I'm completely broken right now, but the anxiety of not having done anything with a girl is eating me alive. It's not peer pressure, in fact most my friends are virgins. However, thinking how my ex has no trouble having guys interested on her while she was the only girl ever interested in me as far as I know makes me so insecure. Also how next year she'll move for university and probably have a lot of fun and meet people, while I stayed in home for university and pretty much made no friends on an engineering career, which gives me 0 free time completely kills me. She's enjoying life, while I'm here just broken.

The chances of me finding someone in the near future are close to zero. Not only I'm a huge introvert, but I have developed massive social anxiety, trust issues and lack of self steem. I know I have to work on those first. But, the more time goes, the more my stress over being a virgin and comparing myself to my ex increases, to the point which it makes it harder for me to focus on myself.

I'm thinking of seeing an escort. Get it over with, absolutely never go back to an escort, focus on myself, and when I think I've finally healed, give dating a chance. Thoughts?",17Oct2020,1
69,"Like I know DAMN well I'm not doing well-- Not mentally, but just in life.

So like... If this were me trying my best and this was the best I could do, that's more fucking depressing than just thinking I'm lazy or whatever",17Oct2020,1
70,"Hi everyone. For 6 years now I have been trying to sit my parents down and tell them that I  have symptoms of depression and that I need some help. But they either dismiss it by telling me I dont have any problems because I'm too young, change the subject, ignore it or theyll get mad. Telling me to get over myself, snap out of it, it's my fault for being depressed because I'm on my phone too much (I keep myself to myself and prefer to talk to my friends because I dont get on that well with my family), and that if people found out i was depressed theyd think I'm weird and a freak. Then they try to get involved like telling me that putting things in the bin will increase my happiness, telling me how much worse their situations are, telling me that I was only cutting because of my period (it wasnt), and making me go out to walk around the town in the middle of an anxiety attack. When I show any signs of sadness or anxiousness they get annoyed and say they're fed up of this. 

I just really dont feel comfortable to tell my parents about my mental health anymore and they wont let me get a therapist. But I've been experiencing symptoms of depression for 6 years now so it's not going away, and i started getting symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder a year ago which has taken over my life. It's getting to the point where I cant function. Im depressed 24/7, I'm self harming all the time, I'm thinking about suicide, I cant concentrate or organise myself in school and my teachers get annoyed, I feel really anxious going in public, I have to wear a winter jacket to cover my body all day and even then I dont feel comfortable. I go to sleep and wake up with the thoughts of how horrible my body is and it consumes me. I just really need some help and I feel like I'm at breaking point. I dont know if I should just go to the doctors and let it all out even if it gets me in big trouble just so I dont snap and put my life in danger. What does anyone think is the best option?",17Oct2020,1
71,"No one talks about this but I figured I can't be the only one with these thoughts right. I'm ftm trans and my looks are okay-ish (I look very young, havent been on any hormones yet) but my voice instantly gives me away. As soon as I talk everyone 'Miss' and 'Ma'am's me to death and I can't take it and I don't have the balls to correct anyone. I've been doing this for years, I get excited at the prospect of a cold or just something damaging my vocal chords so I dont have to speak and give myself away. I've always had an unnaturally weak voice but goddamn I wanna take it all the way. Lowkey hoping for GERD at this point, and yes, I know that's a horrible thing to wish for. Only problem is I like singing and making jokes and talking with my friends. What the fuck do I do? I need some enablers lol, or rather I don't, but I severely want them.",17Oct2020,1
72,"Hi there, I am concerned for my twin. I have started noticing odd behaviors and am wondering if they are normal. We grew up in a bad home with violence and i'm worried there might be something wrong with them mentally. Here are some of her behaviors and stuff she has done that are concerning.

\-They use to be very abusive when we were younger

\-They have outburst

\-They have been caught lying and stealing

\-They tend to throw attitude

\-They like to skin rabbit skulls ( my mom had already called them off) and pop out there eyes and brains, she then saved them in a jar in the fridge for a few days.

\-They just started getting better emotionally ( I hope) and stopped self-harming.

\-They were doing bad stuff online like for example, talking to strangers, lying about being 15 and abused ( they even claimed that they had a 3 year old son that her parents sent away) using a fake email,watching bad porn, getting secret social media accounts, and watching videos about bestiality.

\-When they was confronted my our oldest sister they flipped out and tried running away jumping out of windows, saying they was gonna kill herself, and begging for her not to tell.

\-When ever we play games she makes her person get raped, abused, and kidnapped.

**This isn't all of it but just so you could get an idea:)**

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried asking her about it but she denies there might be something wrong. A few weeks ago someone trimmed our dogs whiskers, and today I noticed our cat had chopped whiskers. When I asked her about it she said the only time she ever trimmed a cats whiskers was when she was around 6 and that she was crazy back then. She said it herself she was gonna be a psychopath when she was older. I am trying to find out if it's her. No one else in my family would be able to this. My dad is very smart and loves animals, my mom also loves animals and was a vet, my sister (18) has the dog Dakota (the one who's whiskers got cut) and when she found out she freaked out and started crying, my other sister (14) is at the moment in a hospital bed (at home) because of back problems, she is a big animal lover and hates the thought of animals getting hurt. My twin when I asked her about it got defensive and started saying she would never do that, she never asked if they cat was okay like the rest of my family had. She had started saying anything could have caused it like our other cat. I know it's not possible, this was done with scissors. Our bio dad was abusive and our brother had used us sexually when we were only 5, could that be why she is acting this way. My brother is diagnosed with Bipolar and ODD (my mom has Bipolar). Could she have a mental problem? If so, what could it be? Is this behavior normal?

&amp;#x200B;

I am really worried about them, I keep thinking they might be a going insane:(",17Oct2020,1
73,"Since I(21 m) could remember my household was pretty shitty my dad would work and would do meth (not sure of the frequency on that) and on occasion he’d flip out for no reason.

My mom has always been the rock and she’d take care of me and my siblings.

So I started noticing around middle school (7th grade) that I’d have these really high moments where I’d feel like I could do whatever I wanted to then go into a sad slump right after just thinking about how much of a failure I am and just picture my future crumbling down.

That translated all the way until college at around 18 I went to my pediatrician and she told me I was depressed and told me to see a therapist but I didn’t listen cause depression to me seems like being gray 24/7 and like I said I have these highs and lows so I didn’t follow her advice.

At 20 I realized I was going to college for the wrong reasons since my cousins told me it was what I have to do and they signed me up for classes and I passed with ease cause their not hard but it just made me feel way more lows than highs. I’d be in a high state for a day then shut down for weeks. 

I’ve since dropped out and I am happy but i want to start working I also think I need to get this shit in check. I really love making videos and just editing stuff for my friends and family and I want to invest in a laptop while I work I’m not a big money or fame kinda guy I just want to do something that interests me. 

But like I said I experience this all the time some times multiple times a day and I want to know if I should talk to my pediatrician again. Sorry for the rant.",17Oct2020,1
75,"
Why can’t I just walk outside without worrying that everyone I see hates me for this or that reason and that they wish me harm? I don’t fit in anywhere; I’ve always been somewhat of an outsider. Do I even deserve what I am asking for? I’m worried that this will is just who I am, my role in this. Being the background character everyone hates in the play of my life.",17Oct2020,1
76,"17f Lol I don't even know where to begin at this point, I have this huge lump in my throat right now and a tear on my eyelids not daring to drop.

I have a sexual abuse history when I was 5 and it's ruined me to this day and the best relationship ever. I guess it's my fault for not letting go of the past I guess. I have 0 friends, no one texts or calls, I get depressed 24/7 and the only thing that makes me feel better is cutting, I've been self harming since I was 15 I guess. My right arm and thighs are dang full of scars that's turned to keloids and looks like shit, ready to scare off anyone that's interested. ""No one wants a suicidal bitch""

I hate myself so much I can't even glance at my reflection, I'm ugly asf with a big forehead, I have a really short afro hair, it's raggedy cause I don't do anything about it, but sometimes I do braid it when I feel like though it's short, I don't eat a lot so I've lost a lot of weight this quarantine, I'm quite small/petite for my age. I feel like with each passing day, the lonelier I get, the harder it would be if someone **EVENTUALLY** has an interest in me. I don't care about anything anymore, my room is a mess though sometimes when I feel like it I can make it gorgeous, but at the moment I'm writing this in a pile of dump. I'm currently in my third year through the University doing Mechanical engineering (I'm not that smart but I try) I can't focus on anything, I can't do my homework, not cause I don't understand, but cause I don't feel like. I feel like what's the use of anything if I'm prolly gonn'  die anyways.

Everything lately lacks that.... thing that makes it worth doing, the only reason I get out of bed is cause the longer I stay not doing anything, the more intrusive thoughts there are, I try to keep myself busy but I can't cause I don't feel like, thus the intrusive thoughts, or other times I play Minecraft on my computer and I don't even realize how much time I've spent on it till I begin to smell myself after 12 hours, lol. Btw, THANK YOU SO MUCH @MOJANG AND NOTCH. 

It doesn't do the job but it helps sometimes.

Sometimes I'm scared to have my bath cause the moment I see my reflection I break down and curl up in the bathtub hoping to die of hypothermia while I let the cold shower do its work. 

I feel so empty and it scares me cause I hate being this way,I don't speak unless spoken to, I don't see a reason for anything anymore, nothing feels like it matters.

 I don't think I've ever been genuinely happy, thinking about it now, I feel like all the times I smiled were fake, I never wanted anyone to see I was dying inside, even as a young child. I had so many secrets a child my age should never keep. I had so many thoughts that should never have been thought off. I have never been happy, all the times I'd say ""Where was the happy girl I once was""  was just faux, I have so many memories of myself that I hate to imagine

Is there any way I can forget these things???

My name is Lisa and I don't feel like this world is meant for me, it was never fait to me in the beginning, what could ever make it change.",17Oct2020,1
77,"I don’t know if there is a better sub to post this. Also, if anyone reads my post history, I’ve been in the US the past few years, not Canada.

There has not been a time more than now that I have felt like I am going to have an absolute mental breakdown. I am just angry. I just hate everything. I how a bunch of stupid pieces of fucking white trash are willing to put other people’s lives at risk and prolong this pandemic because of their absolute ignorance and politicizing of everything. 

IT’S OCTOBER... I let that sink in recently. This shit is still not gone. And I believe it is because of absolute pieces of shit like the president who feel so entitled to do whatever the fuck they want regardless of Dr. Anthony Fauci tells us. I had a former coworker die from this shit and even though I didn’t know him well nor was I super close with him, his family is left without a father,  husband, grandfather, and sibling. There are still similar stories to his IN OCTOBER because of this disgusting mind set that “my liberties are more important than your health, because I personally don’t think you’re going to get infected.”

Not just is there an increase in deaths, but the pandemic society has to continue along because a vast amount of people choose to make absolutely selfish decisions, at least in the U.S. I just feel like I’m going to lose my shit. I’m in my final semester in college, have no job prospects because of this, and had to pick up a minimum wage job in a supermarket where I have had the most ignorant piles of waste for customers tell me shit like “You must be so thankful to have a job.”, and have “dick-nose above the mask” wearing pieces of shit tell me their delusional conspiracy theory for why the masks are pointless and how for some reason it is a political ploy to screw over Trump. Fuck you for that you entitled braindead cunt. Fuck you. I just hate you. I just hate you so much. I don’t usually have physical tears but I’m just pouting for some reason.

Oh but I’m not done, I’m not even close to done haha. Ahahahahahahah. So, then I have my dumb bitch of an aunt, cousin, and multiple 55+ aged relatives send me political shit via text as well as post their shit on any platform they desire. Recently, my aunt sent me this video with how Trump had so many similarities with the bible. And this isn’t the first time that I received this from a relative! “Trump was like Jesus/Moses/Abraham/Joseph because he was born on a (whatever the hell it was) and that is why he is a godlike being and that he is backed by the lord himself.”

Also, to clairfy. No. I am not some ultra-liberal redditor looking for a handjob from the echo chamber. I am centre-left and just want some calmness in the political sphere. I hate it all. I hate how we still have civil unrest in our major cities, I hate how so many homeless have ruined California and the entire West Coast due to political mismanagement, I hate how so many cops have a god complex, I hate how there are extremists that react to these events and ruin the cities for everyone, I hate the nationalism here - posting a bald eagle on social media does not make you a better person. 

I hate how I can’t travel because people have been doing stupid shit that has caused travel to still not be safe, I hate how my father manipulates me emotionally by being an amazing person sometimes and then an absolute arrogant headgames prick at other times (he’s bipolar but claims his “manic depression diagnosis in the 70s was nothing of concern”, I hate how my friends and random ppl still see me as the “haha fat friend” even though I dropped 40 lbs since June and went from a BMI of 29 to 24. I hate how the political subreddits are just “Trump bad” circlejerks without real discourse and pragmaticism with the fact that this election is still up for grabs - this should have been learned back in 2016.

I hate how my ex (who is actually really nice person) just associates with white trash and how she always tell me about how her bestfriend went to jail again or her mom goes to the casino all the time or the fact that her hillbilly brother knocked up a girl he wasn’t committed to at a fairly young age and now won’t be a father figure in his daughter’s life. I hate deadbeat dads, I wish the absolute worst upon deadbeat dads. Yes, my dad has mentally fucked me up at times (hid my aspergers diagnosis from me until I found out on my own) but at least he was there for me unlike some piece of shit that created a life to fuck up so he can get an orgasm. Back to the ex, she was a good person, but with the pandemic and us having to be long distance mixed with the white trash universe she had (think Shameless), I had to break up with her.

I had been pondering the thought of breaking up with her for a while prior to the actual Skype call where I did it. I felt like an absolute piece of shit. Everyone’s relationships should be ended in person. I only did it on Skype because it felt more personable than text or call. But it doesn’t matter, I fucked her up, because she thought I was the one she was going to marry. I visited her dad who was dying of cancer on a 2 hour flight away so I can comfort her (she was up there 4 days before I got up there). It was me going over there to visit that made her think I was the one. Fuck. The only reason I never thought about “playing house” shit like marriage or kids is because 1. I’m scared. I am only 22 yet I still feel like I’m in my youth. I’m just not ready to throw that away yet. 2. I hate young kids and the whole baby culture. I don’t mind having an older kid, but that would involve adoption and eh, idk, there’s so many ramifications. 3. Money. I would rather achieve financial independence prior to having a living being. I have learned a lot about financial literacy over the last 5 years and I now try to save and invest as much as possible to achieve a healthy retirement and eventually wealthy lifestyle. Notice how most young parents are poor as shit, because they don’t think. They think they’re so grown up and that they’re ready, like it’s a fucking fantasy.

I hate how my parents curse all the time in the house yet if I curse in front of my mother while my dad is around, my dad lectures me on cursing in front of my mother. Because she’s a woman?! This isn’t the 50s dad. I also have a younger brother and he hates me and I cannot necessarily blame him. Yes, I think his morals are a little fucked and that he is incredibly rude at times, but I haven’t always been supportive older brother of his endeavours nor have I been the brother that should have had his back. I was a deadbeat older brother who only made his situations worse because I somehow thought I was making them better.

You know. One of my favorite shows is Bojack Horseman. That show helped me understand my own mental health better. Before any one makes a comment about how it’s stupid when people try be like... Rick Sanchez, The Joker, Walter White etc. because they’re missing the point, I am not one of these people. However, most people that have seen the show have compared me to the main character, Bojack. He is a miserable piece of shit with mental health issues who ends up hurting others because he had such a messed up upbringing. The source of his misery comes from him. He has been given the opportunities to better himself and misses everytime he gets close - I don’t want to be like that. I really don’t.

I went to this school for one year before transferring to another state. I made three close friends there. My depression took a toll on me and had some existential crises and ended up drinking myself out of my mind. These three close friends were nice but all nerdy and I slowly ended up making them all resent me in a unique way. The first one to drop me was because I ended up becoming an absolute asshole to them. I’ve tried what I could over the years to get us on talking terms, they haven’t felt comfortable with that and I can’t blame them. The second one I sent an unsolicited snap of myself cutting (my arms) to them and that really bothered them. I ran into them a half year later where they voiced their disappointment with this and we ended up transitioning into a pleasant conversation where I kind of explained that I was in a bad place and should have NEVER done that. It went well, but then I got ghosted. I wrote a diplomatic sendoff text after a few ghostings from him but never got anything back. The third one and I sorta talk but it’s been on and off and I know they’ve thought I’m an absolute garbage person over these last 4 years. I burned a bridge with that place all because I am a dumbass.

Other things that piss me off and have attributed to me having an absolute breakdown:

-My first consentual sexual experience was with someone who had just been banging everyone.

-I’m bisexual and I hate saying this even though I’m open because a lot of straight people start treating me like I’m gay while a lot of gay people make me feel illegitimate about my sexuality.

-Even though my dad always said he would never be bothered with a gay son and told me he supported me when I came out as bi, he still says shit about how it’s gross one when a guy puts his genitals in another guy’s ass and how the balls smack against his rear. He then drops the narrative and talks with me like women are the only people in my dating pool.

-Kinda cliche, but I really hate Tik Tok just because it’s so prevalent today and has so much shit that comes with it.

-My aunt who always takes candid photos of us at family events where I look like absolute shit and posts them social media. Also, stop having your iPhone be your 8 year-old son’s virtual babysitter. He’s discovered some pretty fucked up shit and lacks any discipline or manners.

-I hate entitled parents/dog owners that think that their kid/dog can do no wrong.

-The fact that I’ve been so insufferable at times and that there are still people who talk to me but secretly resent me for this.

-The fact that I’ve been told “I have a good heart” or that I’m an “old soul”. My “good heart” is the reason I’ve gotten so fucked over in the past and it’s not good. My “old soul” is not “old”. I hate most older people because of their stubborness and bitter attitudes toward anything my generation does. Fuck you. You all were rebels decades ago.


-My beard grows so fast so I have to clean shave almost everyday, and no, I’ve grown it out in the past. It looks like shit. People have told me some very hurtful yet truthful things about it when I’ve had it. I just always seem to look gross even though I shower twice a day and wear pretty clothes these days. I just wanna look cute, ya know? But I never do. But I’m not phishing for compliments on my looks. I hate pandering pieces of shit. I accept that I just can’t look cute and hate it. Also, the “fat friend” thing again even though I have a normal bmi these days. Some people just can’t shake the image. Including me.

-The expression “Don’t judge a book by it’s cover.” I’ve gotten jumped/harrassed by sketchy people on the street because that saying made me think nothing was going to happen to me if I kept walking on the same side of the sidewalk as they were even though they looked scary as shit. And I always keep to myself. I never open my mouth unless it’s to eat or say annoying shit to my friends. Fuck that expression by the way. Fuck whoever made that expression.

-Getting treated like a number by every college/university to which I have been.

-Aggressive Homeless People

-The ex-friend who divided my close friendgroup and caused many social hangouts to be separate or a “him or me” scenario. Toxic shithead. The conflict stemmed from a genuine misunderstanding but I believed they had pent up hatred for me prior. I just didn’t have a clue.



I don’t know how much more I can write. I want to pass out back can’t fall asleep. I have a feeling I could eventually be successful, but I still won’t be genuinely satisfied unless I’m travelling all the time. For some reason, travel has always been something. But fuck that. Can’t do it safely for a while and it’s not like it’s a free acrivity you can do year-round anyway. 

Also, regrding my post’s title, I really hate the wholistic stuff. I’m not really sure what I’m looking for here but it will be nice to hear from you all. I’m sorry if this post really demonstrates that I’m a miserable piece of shit. If you come to that conclusion, you’re probably justified in thinking that.

78,"I could be enjoying my day or trying to sleep and just these random horrible violent thoughts come in my head. (I gotta warn you they might be a bit too much.) For example Like right now, my brain goes “what if someone just breaks in?” and I imagine myself being forced on the ground while someone goes “wow what a beautiful daughter” (she’s 5 yrs old and the most amazing smart little girl I’ve known) and starts stroking her hair and goes on and rapes her in front of me. I see and hear her painful cries and the look she has while she looks at me in horror in my head. I see her running away from them in fear only for them to catch up. I  hear the cracks of her neck as they kill her.  Or walking in and seeing my beloved mother who’s been through sooo much in life stabbed to death.  I can’t control these thoughts.

I currently have two friends that I got after moving and I feel like I am bothering them by talking so much. I dont talk all day, but I talk everyday. I know I shouldn't but I worry so much about being replaced or abandoned that I feel like I have to talk to them causing the issue of the clingyness.

I will tell him that I just need a bit of space to read or just lie down in a dark room but he sighs and tuts and rolls his eyes. He’s said in the past that he feels like he’s taking care of someone who is disabled which I don’t agree with. I’ve been a stay at home mum for the past 4 years to our sons and I’ve survived this far, so I can’t be doing that bad of a job.

It’s more the physical side of how my meds make me feel that is challenging and I just need a bit of time out sometimes, especially when our 4 y/o is climbing on the table with his little brother and I’m sick of shouting both of their names. I can’t deal with how my husband speaks to me and treats me. He smacks our son and bellows at the top of his lungs at him and doesn’t understand that he’s making those behaviours look like they’re ok to do. 

He’s working from home doing a job he loves and is left alone all day during the week. But he just comes back with “look, we’re all tired. You chose to stay at home with them. They’re your job after all.” He will do a chore just to get back at me, it’s never to help, it’s to highlight that I haven’t done it because I’m really not in the headspace to have loaded the dishwasher that one time.
I’m sorry for the ramble, my head is a bit muddled at the moment but I would appreciate any advice. :)",17Oct2020,1
87,"My grandparents, who are basically mine(24m) and my brother's(18m) parents are both contemplating ending their lives. After having lost their middle daughter in the middle of the night after Thanksgiving, to their eldest daughter(my brothers and I mother) murdered and their youngest son arrested for being caught talking to a minor. It's began to put a toll on them. I'm currently 2 time zones away from them going to school, I'm not exposed to it constantly like my little brother is as he reports this to me. Yesterday he had to prevent my grandmother from getting to the knives. Then this morning my grandfather told him that they put everything in his name and my cousins name. Saying that they'll do it together. It may happen tomorrow or never. My little brother is stressed and I don't know what to do. I'm not financially able to fly home, so im trying to think of what I can do to help every party involved. Ive told him to seek therapy.

Additional info: my grandmother is an alcoholic and justifies her need for a drink and a smoke due to events that have transpired. They are both hardcore Christians or alleged so this is difficult for me to understand knowing them from this angle. 

Any tips or resources that I could use would be of great help. Thank you",17Oct2020,1

How to stop crying",17Oct2020,1
89,"Last year during my first year of college, I started keeping a diary of sorts to help me reflect. I was going through a very dark time in my life where I had problems with drinking and drugs following a breakup. My father is very religious and my mother has a track record of being nosy, so the writing did me much good. When I came home from winter break I continued to write alone in my room although at this time I was doing better. One time my mom saw me and started prying to figure out what I was writing. I told her that I had kept a journal during college, of course she asked me what was in it but I told her I wanted to keep it private. I got kind of scared she’d go looking for it so I put it in a very obscure hiding spot just to be safe.
Fast forward to now, my phone is broken and my mom let me borrow her old one. I was looking through her camera roll of all her old pictures of me when I stumbled upon at least 50+ pictures she had taken of my diary. After tracing back the dates of the pictures I found that the first ones were taken a day after she had learned about my diary. This was the same day I had spent the night at my friends house and she had found, read, and photographed many of my very personal things. Even worse there were even more days where I had gone somewhere and she’d take the opportunity to take more pictures.
I obviously want to confront her about this but I know she will flip it into it being my fault that I was doing drugs and drinking. I feel embarrassed, mortified, and sick. I’m in physical pain that I literally cannot confide in my own mother without her betraying my trust. I was really trying to fix our bond and she not only read, but took pictures of my personal things to look back on for months and months. How do I go about approaching this or do I just hold it in?",17Oct2020,1
90,I feel like my fears are reasonable and realistic and if I tell someone I could end up making the person I confide in scared too. I don't want to make someone worry about something they weren't even thinking about until I told them.,17Oct2020,1
91,Today I was just doing the usual when I and my friend started having a deep convoy about life.Later I was still thinking about it so I decided to sit in my room and listen to music but then I just got really sad and then felt an urgent urge to cut myself..so I did.,17Oct2020,1
92,Sometimes I'll just be sitting around and I just feel like a deep sinking feeling in my chest. I literally don't know how to describe it but it's like a feeling of doom. It lasts maybe like 30 seconds to a minute or two. Then I feel okay again. I feel like something triggers it but I'm not sure. Usually in that moment I can only focus on that and my surroundings just fade away. It kind of makes me feel terrified and very panicky. After that feeling I need a moment to collect myself. This doesn't happen all that often but it does sometimes and I'm not sure what it is. If someone could help me out I would be very thankful.,17Oct2020,1
93,"First of all i want to inform you peeps that im not finding my condition debilitating or annoying and i am quite happy with my life so far, i am just curious about it as no specialist or doctor managed to define it lmao. 

I am 24 years old, male, in a relationship and have no troubles with socialising with others etc. I am telling this because i was oficially diagnosed with autism before i started elementary school. 

I have never lost my primitive reflexes like rooting or suckling etc. 

I “obsessively” love to sniff my pillow, like literally i can sniff it all day if it has my odor and i get lost in time if i seriously do not try to stop myself. But this not happens if pillow cover has not my odor yet.

I touch a specific type of paper all the time even when going to sleep

Also i compulsively smell people’s hair if i consciously not stop myself


So as you see i am a solid weirdo but after some mocking in middle school and years of self training i managed to learm to hide them quite well in public, so far so that no one can know them unless i want it.

At first they thought i am autistic however as i grow and started school apart from kids mocking me, i was quite a normal boy. So case closed and lucky for me my parents sent me to a public school first before sending me to a special ed as my doctor back then advised. 

In middle school and puberty, kids are quite cruel creatures as many of you may experienced. So my condition once again led me started to visit doctors. Final conclusion of them was that i had OCD.

But to be honest i have no rituals, my behaviour is quite random and i do it instinctively. The only thing i can corelate to ocd is that i am absessed with my territory so to speak. I throw tantrums when peeps touch my “beloved” objects without my explicit permission. But as i said and my current doctor agreed, this is not very much like ocd either. 

Anyways i am just asking this out of curiosity, after finding out that paxera quite supress my instinctive behaviour and concerta helping me to focus on work and not sniffin pillows me and my doctor just gave up to try to name it. My gf also fully know my “condition” and she even finds them super cute even though i sometimes get a bit emberassed lmao. As i said, i am just curious for the name of this.",17Oct2020,1
94,"For reference, I have moderate anxiety and severe major depressive disorder. My doctor, when I brought up my symptoms, said that since some of them were also symptoms of either my depression or anxiety, he thinks it's just me over-analyzing them basically. 
My best friend (19F) has ADHD and she asked about it because she thought I had it based on the symptoms she had observed. We discussed it and she said she was confident that I had it and that even though there is some overlap with my other mental illness, there are enough standalone symptoms to make it seem obvious to her. 
The symptoms I have that don't overlap are long periods of hyperfocusing on something to the point of not eating or sleeping, not being able to focus on anything for similarly long periods, feeling a sense of urgency - basically like everything around me is moving way too slow and I need it to be faster, and a few others but those are the most prominent ones.
Am I overanalyzing? Or should I try to push the issue or maybe even get a new doctor?",17Oct2020,1
95,"I’ve suffered with panic attacks and anxiety for years. My last big stint was almost three years ago where I struggled daily. Through mindfulness, meds, exercise and the occasional benzo I made it through and have felt pretty stabilized the last few years. Only would take the benzos 1-2x a month or PRN. I’m prescribed .5mg of Clonazepam but I cut them in half and only take the .25mg while struggling.
Anyways, I’m going through a brutal breakup right now and am constantly in a state of anxiety, panic and obsessive thoughts. I restarted my Wellbutrin and seeing my therapist over a week ago and I know in a few more weeks it will begin to help, but last week I took a benzo 5 days in a row. It’s only ever the .25mg but I get freaked out by the potential effects of long term use. I know this is mainly my anxiety talking but I am just looking for some advice on how often I could take it, with an end goal in mind, without it being problematic. I feel so far away from my center right now and am really struggling to stay in the moment. I’ve had no appetite, can’t sleep, and have been in a constant state of significant anxiety and panic. I’ve lost a bunch of weight and having a real tough time taking care of myself.",17Oct2020,1

I'm stupid, I can't even do one thing right even though I tried so hard to keep the house in a good condition while they were away and while my brothers didn't do much.

97,"I’m a 21 M. I’ve been out of high school for four years and I’ve realized I’ve done nothing but mediocrity with my life. At most I’ve even stepped back. I grew up a chubby kid who was picked on for being weird, annoying, and fat until I was a junior in high school. By that time I morphed into a big, strong, prototypical jock. I created a whole new person who I wasn’t around that, I acted as certain way for people to like me, but I finally had a little bit of self confidence and self esteem. I ended up partying almost every weekend, get around the county and thinking that I was hot shit. I had an almost god complex. I hooked up with chicks I always thought we’re way out of my league, I had a load of friends and I finally felt like the popular kid. Whether it was in my head or not. I turned into somebody I never was, it made me finally feel like something. Yet, the whole time I went through all this I realized that some parts of the old me never left. I was anxious 24/7, even though I had a little bit of self esteem it was still barley there, I always put people on pedestals above me. Then the end of my senior year comes around, I end up committing to a D2 school to play football. I go up to summer after I graduate and stay on campus and work out, and get prepared for the season. This is when all my demons and the old me came back out of the closet. I wasn’t the same kid from back home, no one knew me. Some guys would say ignorant shit to me, try to fuck with me being one of the only white kids on the team, and then it came to a breaking point like it always has in my life. I’m a over thinker, I stew and stew on things until I explode, I ended up getting in a fight a week before my first spring game. Yeah nobody “picked” on me or said shit afterwards. But I still felt like that fat little sixth grader who girls would come up to and call fat. I felt like the little boy who would get made fun. I lost every ounce of self confidence, self esteem and will there. To be fair it probably was gone way before this but I just finally realized it then. Either way two weeks later after our spring game I had to talk to my coach about howd I be paying for school. I was put on a half scholarship my freshman year but was promised a full scholarship sophomore year.  My family and I could barley afford my freshman year. My parents didn’t know this but I found out through old texts that my grandparents who are retired and live in a section 8 shitty part of my area would use a substantial amount of there life savings to pay for school to help my parents and I. I knew this weeks before I went into that office to talk about how I would be paying and it drained me, my parents working 120 hour weeks slaving away and my grandparents giving up a part of their life for me. I couldn’t get my mind of if Of it. I went in there to my coach and explained everything and he broke the news to me that there wasn’t any way I would be able to get a full scholarship the next season. Due partly to the influx of kids they brought in this season and all this other shit. It broke me right there on the spot, I looked him in his eyes and said well I’m going to have to leave then. He brought up a million reasons why I shouldn’t, even called me a quitter and that I would regret it if I left. I told him I’d have to make a call and get back to him. I went back to my dorm and called my dad, I broke down crying for about an hour. He understood and agreed that I’d have to come home. I went back to my coach and told him, and his last words to me were “ well what are you going to do once you go back” and I told him work like what the fuck else am I going to do? I ended up loading all my shit into my 95 Ram 1500 and driving six hours home all by myself. I cried for about the first hour as I realized my life long dream had just ended. In the other hand I was happy to be home, happy to be back to my safe spot in my room all by myself. I ended up coming home and enrolling in the local community college. I was so afraid and worried about what other people would say or think of me I didn’t tell some of my family or my best friends that I was home for close to two months. I hated showing my face anywhere because I felt like a failure. I finished my semester at the local community college and felt like a even bigger failure. I told my self that I actually needed to do something besides wake up everyday at 11am and go to class. So I ended up getting a job at a local construction company as a welders helper. I stopped going to school and put in 80 hour weeks. I remember thinking to myself there is no fucking way I can do this until I’m 70. But Atleast now I felt like had something to be proud of even it was stupid. Six months in I got hired at another company as a welder making close to $40/hr at 18. This was a blessing and a curse. I immediately thought I was better then everyone else around me because of the money I make. I started drinking and taking drugs very heavily, I’ve had al it of embarrassing nights, and I have done a lot of things that haunt me. Nothing insane, but drunk driving, fighting, and making a jackass out of myself. I know the reason when I started going back out all this happened. I was anxious 24/7 about what others thought, I always thought people were talking about me or wanted a piece. So I resorted to getting almost black out drunk everytime I went out. I haven’t had a girlfriend in over 4 years. I have no self confidence anymore so when it comes to talking to females and making moves it’s one of the most anxious things I’ve done. I’ve gained weight, I’ve had a bunch of shit happen to me over the past four years that I hate. All I do is work, I mean that In all seriousness I’m 21 and I work close to 60 hours every week. I do that so I don’t have to be bored, so I don’t have to be by myself fighting my own demons in my head. But now I’ve came to realize that I’m going to fight each one of my demons, I’m going to crush their souls and get mine back. I’m tired of feeling the way I do, and it all comes back on me. It doesn’t come back down to everything else that has happened to me. I don’t know why I sat here for a hour and wrote this but I just had to. Sometimes when you look in the mirror and you see that piece of shit you really are that piece of shit. When I look in the mirror I see that fat little innocent scared boy. That time is no more",17Oct2020,1

**What I'm Looking For**

My Grandmother just had 2 strokes in four days. I'm looking for an infographic or short bits of info/visual popcorn showing the benefits that playing video games can help people with neurological conditions recover. I'm reaching out here because I find great design to be an incredibly effective tool at helping people to connect and fundamentally, profoundly understand the information presented. As fellow Nintendo users and lovers, I thought the community here may have had similar experiences and found great resources.

I'm looking for an infographic explaining the correlation between use of video games and recovery from stroke. Or maybe an easy to understand chart showing how much faster people who play video games get closer to a place of ""normality"". I know that nothing may ever be the same after, but at least we can aim for more self-sufficiency, confidence, etc. Since I believe a positive mood and outlook is both crucial and desirable to health and recovery, if data includes things about happiness factor (since she's understandably depressed) that would be great.

**Why I Want To Give Her A Nintendo Switch**

No one can give another person happiness, but we sure can bring each other a TON of joy! Joy is the universal cure for suffering. While my Grandma's physical recover is crucial, much of this goal behind this gift is to alleviate those feelings of malaise, isolation, and boredom. These are hard feelings, and really, they only slow down recovery. Nintendo has so many games that are not competitive, but they are about enjoyment. Since Grandma is recovering, I want her to have access to easy games that are encouraging, fun, rewarding, and bring joy.

**Challenges**

My Grandmother is 70 years old. Though she loves being nosy on Facebook, the rest of my family that lives close to her isn't score -1000 when it comes to tech saviness, and doesn't really look into the cutting edge of research or alternative things. When they talk about this recovery, they acknowledge her depression surrounding this, but all intentions are focused on the physical, and none of the emotional needs. In case anyone mentions this - I'm not going to give anyone a talk about what they need to be doing differently right now. I'm buying the switch, I just want them to understand why and I hope they can encourage her to use it. But I am not going to force it on them. They are all overwhelmed and it's a very sensitive time. I love my family but I know their limitations, and this is not the time to boss them around from 3,000 miles away.

So, they're not tech savvy. They don't even have wifi, and her computer might still run Windows XP - but she really loves Facebook so she's not totally inept tech-wise. When I tried to explain to some of them why I wanted to get her a switch, they were like, ""well she's about to go into rehab, might have to do 6 months or longer, then maybe we can think about video games."" Tried to explain it differently, didn't really get through to them.

I tried looking for any succinct, fact-full articles, infographics, anything to show the benefit of video games for stroke victims. Does anyone have any good resources? They aren't big into reading, so graphics are definitely the best.

**My Research, Or, Why Switch Is One of The Best Tools For Helping Someone Recover From A Stroke**

I. *My Mindset*

This is the second loved one of mine that has had brain surgery this year. In February, my friend Elena started complaining about double vision and went to the emergency room, where they discovered she had an aneurysm and a mass. They needed to perform emergency surgery right away. Though Elena is no grandmother, she's also no gamer. She's 28-years-old, however, so may be more open than my Grandmother would be at trying it, but let's not cut Grandma short.

Going back to my thought process, initially this solution came to me from thinking about what types of issues I know stroke patients have to deal with. Issues with dexterity, movement, fine motor skills. I have read that the brain learns motor skills through repetition. I play video games, so I know hand eye coordination is such a big part of it, as is repetition and fine motor skills, so my initial thought process lead me to dive deeper.

I wasn't sure if Elena would totally shut down video games, and I wanted to surprise her with the Switch if I decided to get it, so after her surgery I started challenging her to play pool through Gamepigeon, that imessage gaming app that comes with iOs. She got into those pool games, so the deal was sealed, and I ran to Target and to the hospital. I got it for her to help battle depression, to give her something to help her with feelings of accomplishment, and importantly, also to help her fine motor skills recover quickly.

Unfortunately, she could not play it at first, but she was able to use it to stream Hulu and youtube! So it still helped. As she recovered, she vested more and more into it, and she has told me it has helped her tremendously with things from, just having something to do (let's not forget, we're also living during covid right now), and getting her coordination. She's recovering more quickly than her physical therapist expected, and they think it's because of the Switch.

My Grandmother, however much she loves reaching out to loved ones on Facebook, she has an android so we can't play games on it. I also don't have Facebook and do not want it at all.

*II. I Hear Good Things*

I remembered hearing anecdotal reports over the years about video games used to treat certain conditions. Elena also has a friend that works at a UCSF, which is a leading brain surgery center, after I got the Nintendo Switch he reinforced that it was a good idea based on what he has seen and heard. Now from experience, I know that the switch has helped my friend avoid what would have been deeper depression because we talk a lot.

*III. Google, (v.)*

I have read long, thick articles about why video games may help stroke victims recover. The internet has been so helpful. But, these articles aren't very accessible, and my family is stressed. I hope to find something easy that they can digest quickly.

99,"i was a bit of a troublesome child so in hopes of calming me down, my family spent my childhood comparing me to my little cousin (who is 2 years younger than me), telling me how patient and good she is, how many amazing things she does, how likeable she is, and now i'm 17 and can't stop comparing myself to others.

it's so ridiculous because i will do it for anything. i feel like others are doing better things, are being more successful, and i can't let myself rest with these thoughts. it's a horrible, horrible thing : nothing is ever enough for me, i can do better because look, the other ones are probably doing better things. it fills me with anxiety, it makes me feel like i won't ever do anything great and even if i tell myself a thousand times a second that everyone has their own pace in life, i feel like i will never be as good as other people.

100,"I’ve been depressed since march and pretty anxious too since even before.
I just started university this fall and I can tell anxiety has been impacting my performance in exams. This week was really hard. 
So I called back the social worker who is on my case yesterday and he called me back during the day to talk about how I was doing. In the end he told me he would prioritize my case so that in maybe 4 weeks I could have a follow up with a professional. 
I was happy and relieved to think maybe I’ll be able to save my semester but I don’t want to count on that too much either.
The only problem is that I feel bad because I keep feeling like I’m inventing my problems and exaggerating how I feel for attention. I feel like I could shut up and wait and maybe I’m using resources people need more than me.
But I guess that’s imposter syndrome or something and it will pass. I try to be a little more selfish and just be happy I’m about to receive help.",17Oct2020,1
101,"TW for quick mentions of SH, S*uicide, EDs, R*pe and A*use, none of those is the focus of the post. 

My friends always tell me I can vent to them if I want to... And while in theory I know that's true, I never know what to say to them. 

My closest friends at the moment both come from abusive households, both have struggled with EDs and sexual assault, both diagnosed with depression, both suicidal, and both diagnosed with various other mental illnesses I won't get into. One of them also has physical illnesses to boot.

Me? 

My family loves me, we argue but generally they're supportive. We aren't high income, but we've never been down to poverty. I've never so much as had a shitty ex. I don't have any mental illnesses (and yes, I know mental illness CAN be genetic and doesn't always come from bad circumstance, but I don't have anything genetic either), and nothing physical that's in any way debilitating. 

I have literally NO excuse to feel as shitty as I do. I hate myself, I do everything wrong, I'm lazy and unmotivated, I'm rude and don't grasp social cues, I'm egocentrical as hell, I'm overbearing and condescending... And I constantly, always, unless something really good is going on, feel shitty. 

How am I supposed to walk up to my friends who've been through so much and still struggle with so much every day and say ""today I woke up kinda sad and then my mom told me I was lazy :'("" and expect them to take me seriously?!

I know it's dumb to compare struggles, but I have N O struggles. 

The objectively worse thing that's ever happened is me and my fiance had two separate friend groups that broke apart in a massive drama-- my fiance got painful ""last convos"" and half hearted shitty apologies and that's terrible... And I got nothing. They just cold-turkeyed me like I never existed.

Which, first of all, again, someone close to me got much worse of that situation

And second of all who can fucking blame them? When literally nothing interesting happened to you and you're a boring buzzkill of a person why should people remember you? 

And even now I'm sitting here whining when there's nothing to whine about. 

Boohoo I'm so privileged no one wants to listen to me being sad :((((((((

102,"I am not looking for pity. I just need to rant. 

My mental health has been ...questionable?... since I was 11. My mum took me to my doctor as I had bad anxiety (mainly around throwing up as I have bad emetophobia) and some pretty severe physical symptoms tied to it, she only took me because she was sick of me ""ruining"" everything bc I was always anxious :(

I was referred and diagnosed with g.a.d. and did a 12-week programme with CAHMS - if you are from the UK you will know about their shitty reputation amongst teens. It didn't help me one bit but me being the shy 11-year old I was with already very fed up parents, I pretended it did. 

Now I'm 14, sh*, have bad OCD symptoms, regular panic attacks, suicidal, yk; all the great stuff 😀... and I have no idea what to do. I know I need help but no one knows I feel like this, not even my best friends. 

I always knew I would rather end my life than throw up (ik how stupid and fcked up that sounds but that's just how my brain works with emetophobia) but other than that I had no reason to feel like I wanted to die. But now, everything going on in my head just comes to the conclusion that I don't want to be here. 

I don't enjoy anything at school and barley do anything in class anymore. I loved biology, maths, music, art and I had big hopes to become a doctor or work in medicine. But now I hate them all. I was a smart student when I was a bit younger, things came easy for me, therefore I developed no work ethic which obviously hasn't helped the situation. I have literally no motivation to do anything, I can’t remember the last time I revised for a test. My homework no matter how important, is either done late, not at all, or done literally the lesson its due. I suppose I stopped trying hard in school when I realised I wouldn't live long enough to need it. 😃

I’m pretty sure I have ocd. I don’t want to self diagnose but I’m pretty certain I do. I have all the symptoms and there’s no other explanation for them.

I quit all of my out of school clubs and things and now I come home everyday and lay on my bed. My parents just say I’m lazy and moody, they could be right but when I speak to my friends and others my age generally they don’t want to die lol. 

My friends all have their own problems and I also just don't want to make things awkward by telling them all this so I try my hardest to take my mind off it and still seem happy when I'm with them. 

Yeah I'm sad but I don’t think I’m depressed or anything. Tbh just nothing appeals to me about living now, or later. I’m in mental pain now and later on in life: yeah, you can do whatever you want but shit gets even more real. You have to deal with so much more. I can't be bothered to write it all down but the world is a fucking horrible place. 

I don’t mean this in a whole “I’m 14 and this is deep” way, but I just don’t get life. I seem to be just floating along taking comfort in the fact that there’s always an easy way out.

these are just some that I’ve noticed it all started a bit over a week ago and she just looked different.. 
I don’t know if maybe it’s just a normal thing and nothing to be overly concerned with but I’ve never felt the way she does and responded like it. 
I don’t wanna be over the top with suggesting help or seeing a doctor but she looks emotionally exhausted and I don’t know what to do. I’m afraid of overstepping but I’m afraid it these are symptoms of something potentially very wrong.",17Oct2020,1
104,"I wish it wasn't so. I wish I wasn't stooping to this level. I'm mortified to admit it, but this is a self-promotion. An unabashed, annoying one that may not do anything for me, but I'd rather try and fail than not try at all.

I run an online resource targeting people with anxiety or more general mental health issues. My content is centered on relevant scientific research: I take findings from the fields of neuroscience and psychology and interpret what we can learn from them and how we can apply that research to ourselves to improve our lives.

It's called Above Cognition, and I post fairly regularly to it. I also have an Instagram account, and I post drawings, quotations, and memes to help you laugh at the way our brains mess with us. 

I'm a first-year college student, and I want to transfer schools because I'm paying too much as it is, so if I could get this project off the ground with your help, I'd be so grateful and it would improve my chances of successfully transferring.

So please follow my Instagram page and check out my website: I hope you can learn something about yourself.

105,"I cannot breathe when I eat. I am afraid that I will choke on food if I do. I was unable to find any advice on the internet about this particular eating disorder, nor have I ever found anyone with a similar problem. 

I have done my research and found a phobia called **pseudodysphagia.** A short [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudodysphagia#:~:text=Psychology,undercapacity%20of%20the%20esophageal%20opening) about it states the following:

&gt; **Severe pseudodysphagia** is the [irrational fear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobia) of [swallowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallowing) and minor pseudodysphagia is the fear of choking. The symptoms are [psychosomatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosomatic). The act of swallowing becomes mentally linked with choking or with undercapacity of the [esophageal opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Esophageal_opening&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1). This can induce [panic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic) reactions before or during the act of swallowing. The sensation of difficult swallowing feels authentic to the affected individual, although it is based on nothing in reality. It is important that [dysphagia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphagia) (difficult or painful swallowing) be ruled out before a diagnosis of pseudodysphagia is made. 

However, I am not afraid of swallowing food. I am, however, afraid of choking on food and dying. This fear has become an everyday part of my life and it really scares me. What scares me the most is that one day I may actually choke on food because of this irrational fear, and the fact that I cannot breathe when I eat.

Additionally, I would like to say that my nose automatically stops breathing whenever I put food in my mouth. I do not know why. I cannot control my breathing when I eat. Therefore, I am having to hold my breath whenever I eat something, and I eat *very slowly*. At some point, my body just forces me to take a deep breath when there is not enough oxygen. I am afraid that exactly that may cause me to choke on food one day, and, perhaps, die.

I need serious help. I hope that some of you may give me an advice on how to deal with this phobia and how to cure it.",17Oct2020,1
106,"My mother is a schizophrenic and an alcoholic. I also have come to start to believe that she might be a narcissist. I was told by her that I was the only reason she didn't drive off a cliff earlier that day at probably around 13 years old. Which was very confusing to me cause I didn't understand why she told a 13 year old. And months before she had a schizophrenic episode and threw a glass near me and said i was ""stupid and useless"". Those things that she said to me are still in my mind 24/7. Both of my parents were never there for me emotionally and if i tried to talk to my mother she would say that ""it never happened"" or ""i'm overreacting"" or ""grow up, man up"". All of these things have taken a toll on me and now that i'm 18 i'm ready to open up and speak up. I actually find out through coworkers and security cameras that my mother has been cheating on my dad at 6 am with her boyfriend at MY JOB almost every day. I cant tell my dad cause it will break him. Its so confusing cause I want to love them for the good things that happened in my childhood. but to what extent does the good outweigh the bad? that's the question I find asking myself constantly. Also, as a child my mother used to pick on my weight. She embarrassed me infront of my friends and their parents at a dinner and made fun of my weight. I used to eat in order to fill a void (at the time i didn't know what that was). I have come to think that i might have borderline personality disorder from the constant neglect. During my teenage years i self isolated and stayed in my room all day. There were some days where I wouldn't see my mom or dad at all. They always fought and my mom gaslights my father and he doesn't even know anymore. I'm just so tired of fighting for my life sometimes. I just feel hopeless and useless and I don't deserve to live. Now i find myself losing friendships cause i lash out at them the second they wrong me. When people anger me I lash out and stop talking to them. I hate that I do that after, i really regret losing some of those friends. I just started therapy and I kind of want to bring up BPD but i'm afraid that they will laugh and say no it's not that, when i really do think it is. I dont trust my self or others and i feel like people will use what i say against me. I'm so lost and confused anymore. Idk what to do. The only thing that's stopping me from killing myself is wanting to prove my mother wrong and show her that I don't need her to be great in life.",17Oct2020,1
107," I'm a straight male who daydreams about being a female. Keep in mind that the scenarios in my mind are never sexual, but they can get intimate in terms of the conversations I have as this character in my head. Why do I enjoy being being a female in my daydreams?! The scenarios are usually conversations with people I know, but they like me more as this female character. People are obsessed with me in my daydreams, because I'm this beautiful woman. Is this maybe a sign of hidden insecurities? 
What do you guys think?",17Oct2020,1
108,"So somewhat of a vent but could also use some input either way something I needed to write out. I would like to say I internalize but the definition doesn't quite match, really I just bottle up any uncomfortable emotion or feeling. This has been my method for literally all of my life and other people with my type of personality can probably understand. I've always been the mediator, the funny one, the weird dude and while I do enjoy being those things it tends to wear you down when it's all you can be. I have an amazing friend and support group but it's hard to let any negative emotions show or be down at anytime because everyone jumps on me asking if things are ok. So I'm forced again and again to put on the smile and do the show because I simply can't bear to disappoint the audience. Now onto why I started writing this, anger. Recently I have been in need of a good way to release anger, normally I would talk to the person or people involved and try to resolve the issue but that is not an option for multiple reasons. One of the main reasons being that I'm not even sure if I'm mad or even have the right to be, then I swivel around the next day and say I'm furious and here is a list of reasons why. Anyway if anyone has any input or things they use for unresolved anger please let me know. Also big thanks if you read this all I know it's whiny so apologies",17Oct2020,1
109,"(TW for selfharm/suicide/death etc) So pretty self explanatory, is this something I should take to someone? I'm 18F, finishing high school now and its so stressful. I used to scratch myself with a pin when I got upset however one day I decided to upgrade, I guess, and I now have a razor from a sharpener, that I use every now and again. I really want to die, like a lot, I don't want to live past 24 (That's when I see my Uni course finishing). I remember wanting to die by drowning in a pool when I was 10, and I recently found a note from my 7 year old self that said ""I am very sad, God is dead,"" so I think it's been going on longer than I thought.

I have a lot of stress about social situations, I can't deal with strangers, and constantly worry about my appearance. One of my main concerns is my hair, and I will have what I call a breakdown (but I don't know if that's actually what's happening) if I think it's not right. I can't talk to people I don't know and I don't even like talking to cashiers and stuff like that. I had no friends until year 1 (7), and that was because a more confident person let me join their friendship group.

I run around the house if my head gets too full of thoughts, and I much prefer running up and down the stairs at school rather than talking for a long time with my friends. I get really overwhelmed by people and seem to constantly misread or misstep during conversations.

I can't focus on the right sounds, like when I'm trying to study or listen to a teacher during online learning I will hear my mum if she's talking first. I hate any food related sounds, and I will almost start to cry if someone does something in a song that isn't meant to happen (like clapping during a part that's meant to be silent). I don't know if these are just because I'm stressed or if it's something else.

I don't know if I can feel love? I don't think I've had a proper crush. I also don't really like the way I look (which is normal though I think).

My grandma died quite horribly two years ago (she had a stroke on a plane and had to stay in Hong Kong until we could fly her back here,) and I just felt numb after that. I only cried during a song in the funeral, I don't know it was just emptiness mostly.

I have no way of visualising in my head and as a side effect I adjust way too easily. If I'm on a camp, by the second day I'll forget I had a life at my house. I can't visualise people's faces, which means I don't get home sick, and I forget people exist really easily.

I sleep in a 'nest' of blankets and such, and I can't really sleep without feeling surrounded. I'll put a pillow behind my back in an unfamiliar environment and I usually can sleep quite easily with just that pressure on my back.

Both my brothers have ADHD, one more severe than the other, and I've heard symptoms differ between girls and boys. I don't think I have it, but I do things that I don't think are normal, so I guess I'm just wondering if I'm just overthinking this?",17Oct2020,1
110,"Hi guys, I've been thinking about this lately. I haven't consulted a psychiatrist before, never had the chance to. Before I start, I just wanted to say first that English in not my first language, so I'm sorry if my grammar would sound weird for ya. So about what I am concerned about, I don't know if my parents are also aware of this, it's something about my personality and behavior. There are times when I feel like everything is too boring, sometimes I just feel too lazy to even try something new. I'm an introvert person. I do have some friends, but only a few and I don't feel like I want to make more connection to other people other than those friends that I already have. Sometimes, I feel somewhat lost in my own thoughts. While I'm in the middle of thinking something, there are times when I forget what I was thinking about in the first place and why I was thinking about that particular thing. There is also this stupid feeling that sometimes happen to me where I would just lie about random things and deep inside I love it. I know to myself that I'm just joking around with that person but, the more I do it, the more I want to do it again. Deep inside me, I also think that it's funny and there are times where I laugh and giggle in public when I think about it. Also, I find it hard to sympathize with another person's feeling. I don't know if I can really feel the emotions of other people or if I'm just lying to myself that I get how it feels at all. I don't know if this is something that I should be concerned about, I mean, I think I'm ok. Is this normal? Cause I think a lot of people is also like me right? I don't know, that's why I'm posting this here. I hope you guys can help me.",17Oct2020,1
111,I can’t relate to my former myself it feels like. Situations and experiences were totally different. Some could argue I’ve just grown up but I can’t help but see the negatives that have changed. Like socially I’m definitely not as successful now. I’m less of a strong character type as I am not confident anymore. I know I’m the same person and I guess I put my former self on a pedestal too much. I still see glimpses of myself now as how I want to be. I guess I have pretty low self esteem about the way I am now. I miss being accepted by people socially,17Oct2020,1
112,"My 91 year old grandma has been acting strange lately, we are positive she has early stages of Alzheimer’s but lately she has been saying some really strange things, talking about how she needs to kill a dog and saying she’s been getting calls from people that don’t exist but last night was the tipping point.

She came to my room at 1:30 am and asked me to stop screaming and let her sleep. She was fully dressed and said she needs to leave her house. Me and my mom calmed her down and she went back to bed. About 2 hours later i hear her yelling at the top of her lungs at my mom saying things like “the girl is in the house” and started rambling on about a dead 4 year old girl.

Normally when she says strange things we just calm her down and she relaxes but she’s been saying this creepy things at night lately and it’s getting worse and worse.

113,"For the past 2-3 weeks I’ve been cutting myself to the fat/fascia and have been thinking about suicide a lot. I feel like I’m never going to get better because I’ve been on and off suicidal 7/17 years of my life. I went to one when I was 15 and think I need to go back. I would admit myself right now, but I’m scared my parents will be disappointed in me. Also I live in America and my family is lower middle class :(

Other examples are my father, %1 of world, people lived really full lifes (Theodore Roosevelt, Sir Christopher Lee), popular politicians, nerds in school etc.

117,"  In order to have a better understanding of my life, here is how my past looked like: 

I was born and raised in a small town in a middle of nowhere. Lived all of my life in an emotionally distant family, where nobody would ever hug each other or tell someone something positive. I was literally never praised for doing anything. My parents would only point out if I did something wrong, and tell me how stupid I am.

I remember feeling scared shitless during my elementary school, as other guys would always make fun of me for being fat. Even my dad would constantly tease me about being fat.

As a result of that, I learned to never show any weakness to anyone. If someone hurt me, I would just withdraw myself from them.

I never thought that something may be wrong with the way I was raised. They weren’t physically abusive, they gave me food, they would give me money, but as long as I behaved exactly as they wanted to.

I feel awful for writing this, but I fucking hate them so much. I wouldn’t even cry if my father died right now.

It was always hard for me to connect with other people. I have few friends, but we never talk about our problems, only about social life. I felt like no matter how much time we spent together, I could never trust anyone, and that people will just turn around and walk away from me.  
   
 

So, two years ago I met this amazing girl that I asked out. She wasn’t into me (most likely because I was fat), but we stayed friends. I trusted this girl so much, and loved her. We were only platonic friends, but I was infatuated with her. Since I was so unstable, our friendship broke and I felt like I was manipulating her into a relationship. The last thing I remember is that we had an argument, and she just got up and left. It broke my heart. I was crying for months after. She was the only person that I ever trusted, and she just disappeared from my life.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Every time I see someone I’m interested in, I always remember how people never cared about me, how others abandoned me, and it makes me withdraw and never initiate anything.

I don’t see male guys as potential friends, but instead as someone who will hurt me and mock me.

I don’t see girls that I like as potential girlfriends, I see them as someone who will eventually abandon me.

I don’t know what to do or how to stop this.",17Oct2020,1
118,"Mindfulness is about the here and now - focusing 100% of your attention on whatever you’re doing, being present with whatever you’re experiencing. Trying to be calm or happy doesn’t work - chasing after things which will make us happy doesn’t tend to either. Practicing mindfulness doesn’t switch off difficult emotions but through regular practice it can help us to transform difficult feelings and limit the damage that anxiety, anger and sadness can do to ourselves and others.

As well as sitting down for a guided meditation, you can apply mindfulness to your everyday life, focusing your awareness in everything you’re doing. You can do this when washing the dishes, making tea/coffee or brushing your teeth. Even just sitting for a few moments focusing on what you can feel in your body can have a hugely calming effect.

Mindfulness can also help us to be aware of and tend to our thoughts and feelings - so if we have a sad, angry or anxious thought, rather than being swept away we can stop, breathe, notice the thought, acknowledge what we’re feeling, notice the thought we’re having and listen like a friend. We might think about the roots of that thought/feeling - events in our part that drive our reactions. Its not always easy to remember in the heat of the moment but that's why a little practice every day makes the most difference.

119,"Before I start this post, I wanted to give you information about myself: late 20s, female, Australian, have both depression and anxiety. *There is a TL;DR at the bottom.*

For what feels like almost a decade, I have had commitment issues with various things.  This includes work, tertiary study, video games, social media and even email addresses.

Out of all the commitment issues that I have, restarting video games is what is my current problem.  For games such as *The Sims* and *Animal Crossing*, I cannot stick to one story for longer than ten minutes to a few hours.  For *The Sims*, I always delete my save data and I cannot play without it being clear of previous data.  Even then, I end up stopping either midway of making a sim or just after moving the sim into a house.  Whereas for *Animal Crossing*, I actually was fairly okay when I started in March and didn't have any problems for over a month.  After a few months of not playing it, I am unable to stick to one island for more than 2 or 3 days (in game) before I restart it.  I've tried not to do things that might make me want to restart but it doesn't work.  I love the game but I am constantly repeating the requirements of the first few days so it is starting to drive me insane.

Regarding work, whenever I start a new job I have no commitment issues until a few weeks later where I start to miss work.  My current job (aged care worker) since 2018 has made me miss a lot of work due to a mixture of stress (which lead to really bad burnout in October 2019), anxiety and depression, and overwork.  In the past year I have taken more time off than I intended to and I can't trust myself to not call in sick from even minor things every few weeks.  It drives me nuts, especially after reducing the amount of shifts to help prevent it from happening.  I am trying to look for a new job but due to COVID, it is impossible.

I have made at least five or six times to go to university and five of the times I quit before classes started (and fortunately wasn't charged anything).  I did attend for a semester earlier this year but I only attended classes in the first half before Easter break.  Unfortunately I started *Animal Crossing* in the break which didn't help.  I have realised that I don't need to go to university and don't want to attempt any more study as I'm over it.  Plus it's crazy expensive.

I also have an issue with social media where I make an Instagram account and end up deleting it and restarting after a certain period of time.  I have lost track of how many times I have restarted Instagram.  I have a similar problem with Facebook but I usually would keep it around longer yet it would result in the same thing.  I deleted both accounts around early September and have decided to just not restart them until I figure out what my problem is.  

Like everything else, I have a similar issue with my commitment to email addresses.  This is definitely my longest issue from around 2008 onwards.  It was originally to make new accounts for whatever games I played online or social media.  I have success with keeping a main email address, especially for communicating with family, but it usually changes every couple of years.  Although I make so many other email accounts, especially as back ups or for social media or whatever reason I had at the time of making one.  

*Not related to commitment issues, but does anyone else experience problems with having things in their peripheral vision and can't work unless it's tidy or out of the way and not in their peripheral vision?*

TL;DR I am having commitment issues with various aspects of my life and it is driving me nuts.  What can I do to stick to everything?  Could I have OCPD or something else? TYIA",17Oct2020,1
120,"So I’m currently in the military and getting out for mental health issues that mostly came into the spotlight after my wife left me, still no contact with her and it’s been almost 4 months. That’s the first relationship. The second is with a girl I met two states away and have been “dating” (although I’m still married but separated). She has taught me so much about love and got me to realize my wife sexually abused me and I really noticed it my first day going back to work (someone walked behind me holding a folder, folder touched me and I got super anxious). 

Last night I kicked a table, not very hard, it was small and flimsy and she ran off and cried in my bathroom and I couldn’t handle doing that to her. My wife had left me due to my “violent outbursts” which were just cries for help I guess. I just wanted to be held and have my hair played with until I’d stop sobbing. The second relationship is still in question as she feels we need to take time to better ourselves before we actually consider us dating.

Long story short is I need help to manage anger, express my frustrations and feelings and I would greatly appreciate any resources.

Here’s some additional background information, I’ve been in the hospital twice for mental health, once during active duty, once when I was a civilian, currently in medications for sleep, PTSD (mostly nightmares) and depression. Feel free to ask any questions, I’m okay with therapy like questions and I’d appreciate those too so I can get some more input. Thanks for reading my long post!",17Oct2020,1
121,I have recently gone off antidepressants after many years of being on them. I started therapy and have been trying to be aware of my habits with my unhealthy thought process so i can hopefully change my way of thinking..... im struggling. Hard. I feel really lost and that im just going with the motions of life. I understand that this is a process and with time and effort things may change but wow. Its miserable.,17Oct2020,1
122,"Please note: I reallt struggle with putting my thoughts into real words. So it may go on, but in my eyes i needed to included it lol. I also skip over some stuff, but the gaps I assume kinda fill themselves.


For alot of my memory(up to like age of 14) my life had been me, my dad, and my younger brother. My dad was married and split with ny mum when i was young(7ish), I barely remember it. All I know is for a few years I couldn't see my mum (untill I was 13ish) me and my mum now have a very good relationship, but not a typical one. 

Through these years where I didnt see my mum, up untill I was 16 I just knew occasionally there may be a lady my dad was with, wede visit a few times, and not again. Sometimes they stuck around for a few more months, one or two moved in or we moved to them. The worst one I think my memory has blocked out, because she would verbally abuse myself and my brother, and then lie to my father saying wede done it... 

Then eventually there was a different one. She seemed kinda nice, I liked her for the first 2 years. And then things changed. 
We moved in.
She had 3 kids, a one same as my brother, well call them O. 
Then there was a girl, my age, shes L. 
And then a older boy. Hes not too relevant to the story, hes nice. 

L and O were spoilt. Never did wrong in her eyes. But if me or my bro did it, then it would be atleast a telling off at the table. 

Over time, it slowly became less at the table. More while everyone else was out, so she could be louder. And so she could say whatevee she wanted about me. About after a year she would accuse me of being a lazy waste of space, that I did nothing of worth and that Im weak. (Id like to add, at this point I had a solid job and had bought my own motorcycle, I had finished my 2nd year of college and was starting another degree) 
She started to slowly convice my dad that I was this way. He didnt seem to fully accept it but went along with it. 

Fast forward to early this year. Things were already fragile after several outbursts over the months, including me loosing my temper with her constant need to belittle me and make me feel like I couldnt fo anything. 
My brother comes knocking on my door in tears. I could here shouting of J and my dad before in his room, shouting at him. He asks me when we can get to mums soonest. 
I cant remember what really happened after that. All I remember is feeling nothinf but pure, unrefined hatred towards J. 

We screamed back and forth. It ended with me, my dad and brother sat in the kitchen. Im having a panic attack. I could hardlt breath. The only thing I remember saying to him was ""surely you could tell life was better with only us three"".

I moved out soon after with my partner. They bought a new puppy together the day I left. 
And within about 6 weeks when I visited for some lunch my dad told me the news. They were planning to get married.

I dont kmow what to feel about this. Because it doesnt upset me, or anger me. But I dont feel happy for them either. Do i really feel nothing about this? 

I think I mostly feel like ai struggle to see how they think its a good idea, and what my dad can still see in there. What can he see in someone who made both his children want to leave. 

Let me remind you- my brother is younger than me, and we didnt see our mum for a few years of out life. He didnt meet her properly as his mum untill he was 8... and he wanted to leave, and go to hers. 

TLDR: my dads getting married to someone who made myself and my brother want to run away. She ripped into me as a person probably monthly. 
Im stuggling to understand how I feel. Or if I feel anyrhign about it at all.",17Oct2020,1
123,"I thought that my (20F) problem just might have been watching too many crime dramas and movies/shows of that sort, and maybe that's why I get paranoid. However, I am worried that it might actually be something more serious. I just moved into a new house with my husband, and since the information is out to the public right now, I have been feeling paranoid. for example, I hear noises upstairs and immediately think that there is someone hiding in our house. ""what if someone hid in the crawlspace in the attic and has been there since we moved in?"" ""what if there is someone and they are just waiting for an opportunity to kill me and my husband?"". I am constantly thinking that someone wants to kill us. we have no enemies, we keep to ourselves and have never been involved with any bad people or bad businesses. So it seems stupid, doesn't it? But for the last four days, My husband goes to work and as soon as he is gone, I start hearing noises upstairs and in the rooms. When he is around, I don't really hear it or just don't pay attention to it. So in the last four days, I began to hear it more often, and I seriously started carrying a knife with me everywhere I went. I am alone at home, so if I went to pee, I leave the door open. I sit on the toilet and instantly start thinking "" okay if someone did appear and tried to kill me, the first thing I would do is instantly charge at them with the knife"" Two days ago, I was paranoid more than usual, and took a shower until late afternoon because I was scared to get in the shower, and if someone was going to kill me, it would be the perfect opportunity. I left the shower door a little bit open, with my phone programmed to 911 on the phone app, just in case. And I checked how much space I had the door open so that my hand could easily reach the phone. When my husband came home that day, I was too embarrassed to tell him about the extreme paranoia I had that day, so I simply asked him "" When they do the inspection for the house, they don't check for rats right? unless you suspect it?"" and he said, ""yea but I'm pretty sure there are no rats in the house. If you hear things upstairs, it is probably the house settling or the wood settling or because of the wind"". So I asked him if he had heard noises too, and he said yes. so I was calmer that day. But I still get scared when he leaves and think, what if he isn't here and I die?

One more example before I end this. Yesterday, a man came up to our doorstep when I was going to check the mailbox. It was around 8:30 pm, and a tall, big, dark skin man came up, and really friendly introduced himself and said he was from the home alarm system company. We spoke about the house, and he asked to go inside for a minute to check out the exits and entrances. So I hesitantly let him in. As soon as he walked in, I immediately looked around. I had a knife on the cutting board (I was cooking) and thought that if anything were to happen, that is the first thing I am reaching towards. The second thing was,  as he was walking around the house, I made sure to stay behind him, and not me in front of him. If anything happened, I was going to see it coming and maybe have time to react.

I have been slightly paranoid for 2 years, maybe. Always thinking, if this were to happen, this is how I am going to react. Sitting on a bus, in an Uber, at work, I was always thinking, ""what if this person attacks me? how will I react and save myself?"". If it is of any importance to this post, I was severely depressed from ages 14-17, I didn't take medication, I was against it but I went to therapy 3 times a week and slowly got better, and I no longer have suicidal thoughts or cut myself, and I am very happy now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I am worried that my paranoia might actually be a serious problem. I constantly think that someone wants to kill me, and if someone attacks me, I plan how I am going to react. I recently moved into a new house, and I hear "" footsteps"" in the upstairs.",17Oct2020,1
124,"Lately, I've been feeling frustrated more and more with my terrifically terrible memory, both short term and long term. That aside, I'm also starting to have more and more difficulty with recognizing faces as well as voices (I don't think I have faceblindness though, that'd be a bit too extreme). And then there's auditory processing disorder, which is always fun.

It's the terrible memory that upsets me the most though. My friends can be telling me something, and only moments later would I go like, ""wait what did you say I had to pick up again"". They can even have said something only a couple months back or a year ago, and I would forget that too. I even have issues with zoning out, like putting on my normal shoes instead of my work shoes when I have to go to work. And these are all just mere examples, there definitely is more than just this but I, you guessed it, forgot the more extreme ones.

The ""faceblindness"" isn't much fun either; this morning, I walked my friend's dog with her, and we passed by the father of another friend of ours. Later when we got home though (we're roommates), I had to double check with her whether that was our friend or his father. ""Voiceblindness"" is a thing too; I won't recognize the voices of 99% of all Japanese voice actors, and when my brother goes like, ""did you know that voice is also the voice of character x from another anime?"" I'd go like, ""really???"". Silly example I suppose, but then there's how there were times where I mistook his voice for my father's, or how I mistook my friend's sister's voice for my friend's. And I don't remember our mutual friend's voice at all before he started transitioning- despite the fact that I also dated him for a couple years (I also don't remember his face from pre-transitioning too).

Now, I've had chronic depression since I was thirteen or something, and I'm 24 now. And I know bad memory is a significant symptom of depression, but these issues have only worsened in the last couple months, or at the beginning of this year. It's so sudden, it honestly frightens me, and makes me wonder whether there's more to it than mere depression. I'm not asking to be diagnosed by the way, I just wanna read up on shit to clear up confusion and take it with me to a professional whenever I can go (I have to fix some shit with health insurance first).

So yeah... What could possibly cause this? Just a symptom of depression worsening, or something else? Is there a name for this as well? I really want to read up on it and feel like I'm less alone.",17Oct2020,1

126,"So, the long story short is, I've developed pretty strong feelings for my best friend over the last several weeks (I'm 32M, she's 29F). I don't know for 100% sure that she'd be against it, but I think it's probably very likely she'd not be interested. I don't think it would kill our friendship for me to bring it up, but I don't know that for sure, either, and even if I do say something and get rejected, I suspect I'm still going to struggle with these feelings quite a lot, especially when she starts seeing someone, and then jealousy gets added into all that. But I also don't want to lose the friendship we have, as it's extremely important to me.

For now, I'm trying hard to suppress these feelings. The thing is, these feelings are really taking a toll on my mental health. It's been weeks, at this point, of struggling. I'm at a point where I constantly feel sick to my stomach, I can't stop thinking about her, I have so much trouble sleeping, I can't seem to focus on much of anything, I can't seem to distract myself with anything, and my heart is just constantly hurting from all of this.

And she has no idea. Not that I'd want her to know I'm feeling all of these things and going through all of this over her. But it just sucks, because the one person I know who would be there for me is the one person who absolutely cannot be there for me, right now.

I don't know what to do. I'm so heartbroken thinking about having to forever sit by and watch her build a life with someone else, but it just feels like no good can really come of actually talking to her about any of this. All it would do is make things weird and awkward, at least temporarily, but still end up in the same place.",17Oct2020,1

129,"I was raped by 3 guys when i was 14. They were a friends friend. They took at advantage of me while my friend watched and she left me there. I don’t understand why i said yes to accompanying her there. Probably because i want to have a friend (im kind of an outcast in then) and i wanted to be closer and impress her. When we arrived there, those men were already drinking. They were probably on their late 20’s to early 30’s. How she knew them? I dont know. At first i didnt want to drink because im in an unknown place w people i just met, and they keep calling me a buzzkill or uptight so i gave in and drank. After 3 shots i notice my vision becoming blur and im becoming dizzy. No energy but still conscious enough to know whats going on. Their carried me somewhere with and laid me on a surface and they started pulling down my undergarments (i was in my school uniform) they took turns and abused my body. I kept telling them to stop but they just laughed at me. And started to put different objects in my vagina. I remember one of them said “can you tell the difference if its my dick or the bottle?” They kept going and even using my thighs and inner thighs as an ashtray. They kept taking turns. Laughing and asking me if i liked it. IT WAS MY FIRST SEXUAL INTERCOURSE. im pretty sure they fucked me up for long periods of time because it was still daylight when they carried me somewhere. And I remember it slowly becoming dark outside from the window. They inserted bottles and different objects that i dont know in me. I felt so dirty. 
Then they carried me back to the living room and told me to go home. I was in my uniform without my underwear. I was still fucked up and i walked home. 12km away. I fucking walked. I had a hard time letting people touch me for months. Even a single tap on the shoulder fucks me up. Now its still in my head and im 23 now. It still fucks me up. Worse part about it is that i kept it to myself for YEARS because i didnt want my mom to know and call me names and i was scared. when i finally told her after 4 years she didnt believe me and blamed it on me because i went out and i was too trusting. That fucked me up even more. So i went through it alone with no one to cling on to or talked to. I am so fucked up and dirty i dont know of anyone will still accept me or love me",17Oct2020,1
130,"Not really looking for advice although I’ll welcome any. 

When I was in HS I had a small group of best friends, about 7 guys and 4 girls. We were all close and hung out every weekend and every day of summer breaks. This continued for the first few years of college, but over time I fell into drugs at school and I distanced myself from almost everyone in the group. 

Six years later and I’m sober now. Some people moved away, however there are still 6 or 7 of these friends that hang out a lot and go on outings. I live in the same city as them, but I am almost never invited to these outings and I see this group once a year or less. There’s a few of these friends I see a bit more often (maybe once every six months), and I still have active group chats with this group and with individual people. But I almost never see them, and it is 100% my fault. 

For the first few years, I was always invited to everything, and 90% of the time I said no. I was dealing with personal stuff and wasn’t being a good friend as a result. These days, I feel out of place when hanging out with this group. There’s new people I don’t know, stories I’ve never heard, and plans I’m not a part of. I’m awkward and anxious around the people I used to consider my best friends. There are a few friends from the group that I still feel comfortable around, but only in one-on-one settings. 

This all would be fine with me if I’d found new friends, but I haven’t. My best friend is my brother (always has been), and besides him there’s a few coworkers I’m friendly with but never hang out with. I have virtually no IRL friends anymore. 

Again, I’m not really looking for advice on remedying my relationship with my old friend group. I feel like I’ve distanced myself from some of them to the point that it’s damaged beyond repair. But there are a few individuals in that group who I still value my relationship with, but I understand that I’m not very close to them anymore relative to their other friendships. 

I guess I need to find new friends or stop taking the few that I have for granted.",17Oct2020,1

132,"TL;DR: i think have PTSD from dealing with a chronic illness/life threatening disease since i was a teenager. Anyone else in similar situation?

When I was 11, I got sick. Doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong with me, and eventually decided I was faking. While my parents believed me, they could only do so much and eventually we all agreed thay I would see a psychologist. Psychologist knew that this wasn't a mental health issue and actually helped get resources to have me properly diagnosed. 

From there, my disease (which is normally not life threatening) became life threatening for me. I was in and out of hospital. Getting all kinds of treatment, including chemotherapy. I've had five major surgeries to correct issues caused by the disease, with many more in my future. 

I'm now 25, and while I've been able to complete an education, I've been unable to work since graduation, due to health complications. 

The last few months have been particularly hard on me. And I've been reflecting (or obsessing) over everything I've been through. And a large part of me believes that I have PTSD from living with this. But its not one particular instance that has caused me issues, its the experience as a whole. The terror of almost dying, the fighting with health professionals to believe me, losing friends because they didn't believe I was as sick as I was, missing out on milestones, watching my future melt away, traumatizing my family, the bullying, etc.

I'm supposed to be at the point in my life where I'm working on a career, moving out of my parents house, creating a life of my own. But I'm stuck in the same place I feel like I've always been. And I want to move forward but I feel like I can't. 

And I'm constantly plagued by the thought that the disease could become as bad as it once was, where I'm fighting for my life and become a shell of who I am. And it's terrifying. 


I was put on medication for anxiety and depression when I was diagnosed with my disease as they are common side effects of the disease, but I haven't actually seen a psychologist, therapist, psychiatrist, etc. since they put me on the medication so I've never really had someone to talk with about everything I've been through. I've recently had a referral sent for a psychiatrist but no clue when they will be able to fit me in. 

I guess, besides just getting these thoughts out of my head and into the world, I'm looking to see if anyone else is in a similar space? Anyone with PTSD caused from a similar situation? How do you deal? How do you move on?",17Oct2020,1

135,"Some background: 21F with severe anxiety and depression issues and ADD. Last night I drank a lot of alcohol but not dangerous levels. I spent the night with a close friend that I often sleep with. In the morning I remembered very little of the previous night. Total blackout. 

My friend told me that I was acting very weird. We were hanging out with a group of friends when I started really zoning out. At one point I got up, started walking somewhere, seemed really dizzy and collapsed. Didn’t pass out but didn’t seem to know where I was, was mostly unresponsive. Other people who witnessed this confirmed that this all happened. 

After that he says he eventually got me to his room and tried to make sure I was ok. I was awake but not talking, seemed unaware of him trying to interact with me. I didn’t respond to anything he said. Had very poor motor control and often went limp. Supposedly I seemed a little better at times, like I might be coming back, then would slip back into what he described as catatonia. Just completely spaced out and detached from reality while staring off into nothingness for quite a while.

137,"Hi everyone, 

I hope your day is treating you well.  This is my first post on Reddit and given the anonymity, I feel it's a great place to ask the community  what has worked either for themselves or others for those impacted directly or indirectly with mental health issues.

For background, I'm 36(M) who has been diagnosed as both Bi-polar and in the past, I struggled very heavily with depression and multiple suicide attempts in my teenage years.  I'm no longer suicidal, but I do struggle with my depression from time to time.  The bi-polar incidents I can handle as I recognize whenever I get either too high or too low (for those of you that know, I feel that you'll understand what I mean by that).  By all accounts, I've done very well for myself.  I'm financially stable, have a decent-paying job, bought my own house and my car was just paid off in July.

I have had, for the most part, an outstanding support system whenever I've ever reached out that I'm not feeling well.  I can tell my male friends ""Beer tonight"" and they know it's essentially code to spend maybe an hour or two while we have maybe a beer or two and it's mostly just time spent to help me through it.  

I've often wondered how others are able to cope.  I see a lot of posts about ""speaking out whenever you're not feeling well"" or ""calling someone no matter the time or day"", but I can speak from personal experience, the hardest thing for me to do whenever I'm feeling down is to reach out my hand for help (metaphorically or literally).  I've seen and heard personal stories where people commit suicide and the pain it causes others around and they wonder what they could have done to help prevent it.  The easiest and most simplistic answer I can give from own experience is that I don't want to be a burden.  It's crippling, society tells us we're supposed to be able to pick our own weight.  Those individuals I spoke about earlier all have their own families to worry about (they're all married, in VERY committed relationships, have children, or a combination of the 3).  The absolute last thing I want to do is burden someone else with issues I can't explain very well or even worse, I don't want them to pity me.  The absolute worst part is that these people are all absolutely wonderful individuals, they all want generally the best for me personally and all have offered to help any time or place. 

I've spoken with others who have similar issues (those with other mental issues) and I've asked what they think the best advice is for someone who wants to help someone struggling with mental issues.   We all don't have a good answer.  Those I've spoken to and I don't have an answer when someone asks, ""what's the best way to help someone who might be struggling with issues from time to time?""  The line of reaching out to someone?  I don't think it's a good answer.  A hotline to speak to someone anonymously directly?  I'm skeptical because of the reasons I listed earlier.  

Apologies for the long rant if it comes across that way, but I want to ask everyone: what's your answer to someone who asks what's the best way to help someone with mental issues?  I don't know if it makes sense or not, but I'm hoping you, the reddit community, can help me find an answer.

Thank you for your time, and more importantly, your honesty.",17Oct2020,1

142,"One of the biggest problems with getting a diagnosis of bipolar is the doctor needs to see manic episodes otherwise they think it’s unipolar depression. But hypomania (not full-blown mania) feels ‘nice’ so you’re probably not going to go to the doctors and they’re not going to see you manic.   It's very important (if you do have bipolar disorder) that you find the right medication and get some help as the illness can be very damaging to both yourself and those around you.  It can make you think and behave in ways that are just not like you, not to mention the increased risk of self harm, drug abuse, or worse.

144,"Hi all,

I have struggled a lot with my mental health for most of my life. It really peaked in my late teens/early twenties and manifested in a lot of self-destructive behaviors, disordered eating, physical self harm and relationship issues. I lost pretty much all my friends during this time and really struggled with my new marriage and failed to launch a career after college.

A few years later I am generally feeling more comfortable in my own skin. I still don’t have friends but I have rekindled my relationships with my family and spouse. I am still not in a great place career wise, but for the most part I like what I do and I don’t have a lot of anxiety about going to work any more. My partner and I bought a house and I got a dog who gets me out of the house and keeps me company when I am alone, which is pretty often since my partner likes to go out and we also work different hours many days.

I do still think the years of struggle continue to make it difficult for me to have a more fulfilled life. After years of kind of living in a hole, I find myself having to be really mindful and disciplined to complete basic self-maintenance, like washing my hair or trimming my nails. I have tried to get back into my hobbies but after so long it’s hard to resume, even if they are things I really do enjoy. I am sure many of you out there can relate. While I’m far from being in a crisis nowadays, I feel so much of my life has been wasted and what I still really want is some level of happiness and self-actualization.

I live in the U.S. and counseling is expensive. The only time I ever received professional help was when my spouse and I saw a counselor for two sessions, which I do think helped us immensely, but then we couldn’t realistically afford any more (neither of us had well-paying jobs), even with insurance. At the time our counselor recommended that I also attended individual sessions, but we both just made do without and made it to a better place on our own.

At this point, for my needs, I am thinking online counseling might be appropriate. I just need someone to help me reorient myself and let go of the nagging sense of regret for all those years I lost to mental illness. I was wondering if checking in with an online counselor via better help, etc. would be a productive option.

There are a lot of posts asking about online counseling on this sub but very few answers, and every situation is unique. Personal and professional opinions/advice are all welcome. Thanks!",17Oct2020,1
145,"So I have bipolar disorder my sister suffers from panic disorder and bouts of depression. Anyway, since Covid 19 came to disrupt everyone’s everyday living I noticed her mental health deteriorating a bit. Luckily for me, with everything slowing down for once, my mental health was the best it had been in over a year.

Some days, she would vent to me and tell me that she didn’t care about taking are of herself and that she was feeling down often. I noticed her struggles with her not wanting to anything aside from work from home. She wouldn’t shower for two weeks at a time, I had to remind her to brush her teeth, and she was sleeping for much longer than usual.

Finally, I came up with a system! Every Saturday is out “girls day” in which we’ll rotate between a mani/pedi, doing each other’s hair, watching our favorite show, and absolutely no work. Always starting the day with a shower- something she has no desire doing during the week.

It’s a little step but it’s something she looks forward to, and it’s something fun for me too! She seems happier during the week, and has her first therapy appointment this week!

When im with the few people that i care about i feel euphoric at times, until the emptyness and sadness i feel most of the time slowly creeps in. I can not seem to get anything done outside of those few moments of panicked overworking.

Seeing her self isolate like i did for years, it hurts cuz i get a generall feeling of the thoughts shes having. Neither of us have our respective dads in the picture and i know how that feels. Im scared of what she would do if she learnt from my death that ending it all was something someone she looked up to was willing to do, she might even think that the years between us was enough to break me when in reality ive been a broken person for longer than i have been ok. I dont really know how to end these inane ramblings disguised as a post, so ill just say that i hope you people in this subreddit enter a better part of your lives and start feeling better, cuz i dont know if i ever will

Ps. english isnt my first language incase there are some grammatical errors or generelle mistakes, i apologize

Tldr: i dont feel good like most of the people here",17Oct2020,1
150,"I'm been feeling pretty low recently. I don't have the support system I once had and the lockdown has made it incredibly difficult for me to not think about my insecurities. I am feeling very lonely and unworthy of care and support. 

I reached out to my bestfriend, she said she would call me but she didn't. I'm sure it's because she was busy or genuinely forgot about it but it made me feel pretty terrible about myself. It made me feel like nobody cares for me and I don't have anyone to go to when I'm down without feeling like a burden. 

I was also feeling lightheaded and had a headache today because of my anxiety and I wasn't able to study today which also made me feel pretty awful about myself. I just wish I had someone to talk to. I wish I had someone who would listen to me. I wish most of my friendships weren't one-sided. I wish my family members could see that I'm falling apart. 

I'm afraid I'm going to do something to myself but I don't feel comfortable sharing this with anyone now because I don't want to bother anyone with this crap. I don't want to be seen as an attention seeker or a dramatic teenager. You know, the way I've always been judged when I reached out for help. I don't know what to do anymore. Anyway, sorry for the long post. I don't really have anywhere else to go to share all of this.",17Oct2020,1
151,"*I've tried to keep this concise and to the point but I've been adding bits here and there and going back to sections, so some bits might be a bit all over the place*

I don't know why I'm writing this, tried most other avenues and feels like very few are really listening and hearing what I'm saying and the ones that are, have impossible hoops to jump through that I just can't manage.

I'll go back a bit - 

I'm 31 from UK, Ive always had horrific mental health issues but for the last few years, things have been completely unmanageable 

I've never been able to deal with people at all, but losing myself in work seemed to help, so I ran with it, my only issue was taking on WAAAAAY too much. I ended up shirking my normal work duties, become the point of contact for a lot of different subjects and focused pretty much exclusively on fixing problems and taking on the most horrificly, mangled fuck ups imaginable. Things we'd screwed up on and customers could complain to the ombudsman about and actually win a case (Work for a large pension provider/finance company). 

I enjoyed it for a time. Most people are really nice and open up when they've fucked something up and if you help them fix the issue, don't take the piss and let them know you fuck up too (which I usually do) you usually end up friends or at least you have a chat with from time to time. Also helps our customers get things sorted quickly and get the outcome they deserve.

This obviously has some negative effects - People start coming to you for any and all problems, which within reason is fine, but when there's a couple hundred people in your department alone, over 2 thousand in the building at any one time, it gets out of hand. 

Add to that the people who don't really need help but if they can get someone else to do it...

During this, I finally told my wife about things that had happened to me as a kid (raped by a teacher, left school at 15, multiple relationships with men WAY older than me when I was underage and the usual drugs, drink and bad decisions). Telling someone helped at first but then the paranoia kicked in and it felt like everyone on earth was judging me

Fast forward a year or 2 and I'm popping 6-8 bars of Xanax a day, nearly a bottle of rum or gin, anti depressants, codeine and tramadol just to deal. I left my wife and kids, shacked up with my ex, bought a stupidly fast car so the police couldn't catch me, and proceeded to go on a 6-8 month bender, signed off work with full pay, out all day, everyday, Completely out my mind, believing my wife had caused me to snap and leaving would fix everything. I Completely destroyed myself.

Finally came to my senses about a year in after a conversation with my son about how he was terrified I was leaving and he didn't want me too stop seeing him (the worst moment of my life)

My wife stuck by me. Helped me get sober, get back to a point where I could function (or do the bare essentials at least) and made it feel ok to ask for help.

If it wasn't for her I wouldn't be here right now, some of the shit she dealt with, no human should have to see/feel. Cheating, drugs, overdoses, emotional abuse and blackmail. How she is still alive and functioning I have no idea. She really is my hero (even though I don't tell her anywhere near enough)

So that brings us to now - I'm nearly a year Xanax and diazepam free, don't drink anymore, no drugs other than a joint every now and then. Lost 6 stone and look better than I ever have, and feel like I look  good for the first time in over a decade, but mentally I'm worse:

- Suicidal thoughts - The worst I've ever had, 100% of the time, whenever I do anything
- Paranoia - To levels I can't even handle, causes me to shut down for days.
- Seizures - feels like too much information coming from my brain, rush similar to coke coming on then every muscle in my body tenses to the point I can no longer control motor function, eyes roll in back of my head, shake everywhere, but I'm aware what's happening, doesn't seem like epilepsy.
- brain-zaps, between 5-15 at a time, one after another every other minute at worst, unable to hold conversation or control motor function when this happens apart from when I'm angry and in complete meltdown
- Permanent fight or flight mode, usually both fighting each other, if that's even possible, feels like that anyway
- Can't eat
- Can barely drink
- Can't take my meds
- Can't talk to people
- Voices in my head, disembodied voices around whatever room I'm in, sometimes it grabs me or blows on my neck. Happens rarely but enough that I'm nervous of it at all times. Seems to be when I'm in a really bad way
- Bright lights/flashes/lightning and textures on objects move. Again, only when I'm in a bad way
- No longer in control of my mind or thoughts
- Losing massive chunks of time
- Wake up/come too in weird places around the house with no clue how or why I'm there
- Can barely control myself in any emotional situations
- No memory or train of thought
- Also terrified of being sectioned - my wife's a carer for elderly dementia sufferers and I'm the designated driver, also gotta do school runs and it feels like if that happens, I'm failing my family. We also have fuck all money and serious debt (due to my issues) which adds to it.
- *Wife's addition* - I think you need to put what the specific suicidal thoughts are, crashing car whilst in it eg into water. Like you said the other day even imagining using a blunt knife, as it's not just a case of you think you want to kill yourself, you've put the thought into how &amp; where you'd do it.
Alot of people say in jest they wish they were dead . That's not the case with you. I think that's what a lot of health professionals arn't taking seriously with you


I can keep things together around my kids, no clue why (paternal instinct kicking in maybe), and my wife can calm me down some of the time but if on my own and other people are involved, it will escalate indefinitely until they stop/leave, or I will stop it

I can manage about 5-10 mins of normality out of the house/car on my own , but when it starts getting close to that, I start to unravel and I either walk away and won't talk or I flip my lid and become completely unreasonable, irrational and will stop at nothing to stop whatever is happening that's making me feel like that.

I'm not a violent person at all, I've never hit my wife or kids, not had anything even remotely like a fight since school, but when strangers and in some cases even people I know back me in a corner, I will do anything to get out of that situation, and that terrifies me, as soon as I panic, even slightly, I become completely unhinged and usually can't recognise the danger I could potentially cause others, only preventing something happening to me.

I was at Halfords (car accessories/bicycle shop in UK) not long ago and got in an altercation (non-violent) with a member of staff - I think he could tell I was cracking and wanted to help, he was really nice but wouldn't let me leave or leave me alone, followed me to my car and proceeded to hold my car door so I couldn't drive off, I went to drive off anyway, which would of killed the dude, I was 100% aware at that point that if I set off it would kill him, luckily my wife saw what I was doing and stepped next to the guy, I've noticed her and instantly clocked on to what I was doing and how crazy it was and stopped. The look in his eyes, I wanted to die on the spot, he wanted to help someone out who looked in trouble, and he could of died for that.

I had a seizure the night before last and my wife called an ambulance. We figured it was due to rapidly tapering my medication down to nothing (at GP's request so I could switch to something else), Got admitted and referred to the mental health team. 7 hour wait, I'm climbing the walls, finally get in to see them 9am the next morning, not slept in 30 hours, no meds in a few days, in complete meltdown, they still hadn't given me any meds yet. I instantly panic, try to start telling them what's brought me in today and one of the nurses asks ""Have you always had mental health issues?.."", I start talking for a split second, I think about starting talking about my childhood and then freak, run out the room, discharge myself from hospital and walk home from the other side of the city.

My wife's at home panicking, police and hospital are calling my mobile non stop, I can't deal. I manage to just about get home a few hours later, completely destroyed, had a bath and got a couple of hours sleep. 

Wake up feeling worse than before. My wife calls round pharmacies, no help, I freak and drive to the nearest pharmacy and break down telling the clerk my whole life story whilst shaking and barely ably to string a coherent sentence together, he instantly tells me to call 111 (non-emergency ambulance number which we rung the day before, when I was admitted to hospital) I freak again, run out the shop, it quickly escalates into me panicking and driving home like a complete fucking lunatic. 

My car's starter motor is knackered and it's in a really hard to reach place in the engine bay, so I use the end of an aluminium baseball bat (tried a tire iron but not heavy or big enough) to gently tap it to free it and get it going. I keep the bat by the front door so if the car is knackered I have something to use I can grab quickly (don't keep in car for obvious reasons), my rational after getting home was to grab the bat, go to a different pharmacy close to my house that's closed, smash the window and grab the meds. ""If they won't give me them I'll take them myself, I'm preventing me getting worse so its fine."" After a few minutes I notice how insane this tangent is getting, and how quick it's escalating (it doesn't feel insane, feels like the best idea imaginable, but rational thought can just about be heard). I tell my wife.

Wife manages to calm me down and get me back a little bit but I'm fucking spent.

Literally spent. 

I've missed out 60-70% of other shit that's happened otherwise this post would be 10 times the size, and I'd probably snap before I finished.

I feel like a hostage in my own head, being held at gunpoint by a completely delusional psychopath and no matter what I do, who I talk too, it always ends up back at ""You need coping strategies before we can move to psychotherapy"" which I completely understand, it'll cause more harm than good if I progress without them, but where does that leave me now? I can't talk about it without getting emotional and when I get emotional I go thermonuclear. 

I'm slipping and finding it harder and harder to control myself or remove myself from situations. I've started getting more argumentative and running away less which is scaring the hell out of me. Guessing it's due to constantly wearing a mask and feeling stronger when my face is hidden maybe. and the thoughts that go through my head during all these times are insane. 


What can I do now? Everything everyone says I need to do I've tried to do but cant, my whole body shuts down. I've watched self help videos (specifically Russel Brand and Jordan Peterson) and they make sense, I can really relate to what's been said and can see how it would all help, but putting it into practice never seems to have the desired effect.

I didn’t want to go to school because my mom word was worse than the bullies but I knew they were coming fuck any self love I had too. I had a panic attack reliving that hell of a morning.

174,"COVID has made the world desperate. It has taken away millions of jobs. Just as organisations are working out ingenious strategies to keep their heads above water, people are getting creative in their ways to earn a living in these disrupting times. This pandemic has forced people to not just fight for their physical immunity, but also fight for their mental immunity.

The World Federation for Mental Health has urged all countries worldwide to invest heavily in reviving the mental health of its citizens, whilst investing in reviving their respective economies. From loss of jobs to loss of loved ones to loss of freedom, the COVID disruption has brought about a climate of uncertainty among all generations, especially women. Falling incomes, job uncertainties, isolation, social restrictions have impacted women during the pandemic.

In South Korea, there was a 7% increase in suicide rates among women. 1,924 women in their late teens and 20s committed suicide in the first half of the year. Less than a thousand kilometers from South Korea, in Japan, the economic crisis has impacted women, which resulted in female suicides jumping up by 40% in August 2020. Far from the Asian continent, in the U.S., between February and May this year, 11.5 million women were laid off compared to 9 million men. And to add insult to injury, these jobs that women were laid off from were in America's top lowest paying jobs.

As World Mental Health Day 2020 focuses on investing resources towards improving mental health, the world needs to invest in a broader mindset towards improving the mental health of women. And that can only happen by giving them their due freedom on both fronts - digital and physical.

ENABLE AND NOT DISABLE

In its last survey that was conducted in 2018, ‘Freedom on the Net’, a comprehensive study of internet freedom in 65 countries around the globe, covering 87 percent of the world’s internet users. It tracked improvements and declines in internet freedom conditions each year. The countries included in the study were selected to represent diverse geographical regions and regime types. Of the 65 countries assessed, 26 had been on an overall decline since June 2017, compared with 19 that registered net improvements. The biggest score declines took place in Egypt and Sri Lanka, followed by Cambodia, Kenya, Nigeria, the Philippines, and Venezuela.

According to news service AFP, in recent years, Egypt has enforced strict internet controls through laws allowing authorities to block websites deemed a threat to national security. It also allows the monitoring of personal social media accounts with more than 5,000 followers. Earlier this year, in June, the Egyptian government arrested five of its citizens — all of them were women — all of them in their early twenties — all of them were social media influencers — all of them were from working-class backgrounds.

This was for posting videos of themselves on social platforms promoting products and services from brands they have been paid to endorse. In Egypt, with influencers imprisoned for ‘violating public morals, and the values and principles of the Egyptian family’, the question being asked is if the alleged wrongdoings are being tried under the correct legal charges, or if broad cultural grey areas are replacing the legal black and white. Egypt, and especially her youth, has repeatedly shown the world the desire and willingness to be a valued member of a global, digital community. They are now at the cusp of another transition.

DIGITAL CENSORSHIP IS NEEDED FOR THE RIGHT REASONS

Laws need to be applied to content that clearly incites danger – whether to do with individual harm, mass violence, or national security matters. Governments need to listen, to adapt, and to harness their energies, rather than impose unreasonable expectations. There needs to be a new social compact to meet the youths’ desire to express themselves freely, and, at the same time, respect societal values – one that is achieved by consultation, not coercion.

In Germany, instead of censoring the content shared by its people, it introduced a law called 'Network Enforcement Act' or NetzDG in 2017.  NetzDG obligates all social media platforms with over 2 million users to delete any content that promotes hate speech or offends religious sentiments posted on their platforms within 24 hours from the time of posting.

NetzDG is effective, because when a social media platform fails to delete the content within the stipulated timeframe, NetzDG punishes the violating company with steep fines of up to 50 million euros for non-compliance.

While social media platforms, whether, due to their own aggressive content guidelines, or the restrictive framework set by the countries they are being used in, are proactively deleting content that's even remotely sensitive, it must be remembered that over-implementation of such censorship is a violation of human rights law under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Any censorship that misleads people at large must be censored. Only then, can we pave the way for a more transparent future. Many countries have shown that highlighting and recognising influencers with positive social messages can have an impact on the wider pool content being created.

At the same time, Governments need to recognise that it is not feasible to impose ‘One Country, One Culture’, as the Internet already provides spaces and content for every imaginable interest group. This seriously impacts the mental health of today’s youth especially women.

If it appears that internet censorship is a syndrome of the developing countries, more so in countries that are governed by the laws of religion, as opposed to countries that are run based on laws drafted towards protecting human rights and improving the overall state of affairs for human life, the appearance is certainly misleading and one built on false impressions. Whether afraid of being without a job and not getting a job is a concern in itself, for women who are laid off or working from home, their problems are only made worse.

When the lockdowns began, there was a drastic surge in helpline calls for domestic violence against women. Italy’s domestic shelters for domestic violence victims filled up quickly after the city went into lockdown. Spain recorded 18% more calls on the emergency helpline asking for help. Singapore recorded 33% more calls on its AWARE women’s helpline cell. Australia recorded a 75% increase in search on Google for domestic violence help.

At the same time, Governments need to recognise that it is not feasible to impose ‘One Country, One Culture’, as the Internet already provides spaces and content for every imaginable interest group. This seriously impacts the mental health of today’s youth especially women.  done without. In its defense, it has brought to light the inequities, the gender divide, and the suppression that women are continuing to face and endure in silence.

There were a half dozen rusty nails hammered into a crack in the wall. I went passed and they appeared to be worms trying to wiggle free. I started removing them when a co worker walked by. Asked me what i was doing 🤔. I told him i had to take them out cause they were bugging me.

So that coupled with randomly hearing my name being yelled by ""a crow somewhere"", has lead me to wonder... Am i okay? Im going to see a pychologist soon for anxiety but i dont really know how to bring this up without sounding insane...",17Oct2020,1
177,"I donno how to handle me correctly. I am finding myself in absolute reaction mode way to often. 
Quick rundown of me. 20 year heroin addiction filled in with any other substance I could find. 10 years behind the walls. Been off of hard drugs for over 4 years now. Still taking 10 mg of methadone daily.
If I find myself in a disagreement with another I cannot turn the volume back down. It feels like a manic episode until I can get myself away. I don't know how to approach mental health professionals I've never been for lack of a better term diagnosed. I'm trying to figure this out before I end up where I started.

178,"I'm not a very smart person, all i know is that i used to be smarter, more civil than what i am currently.

I dont know a good way to describe my situation, but ill use this as an example.

Im an anime fan, not the kind that continuously tells others to watch it, i simply watch it for my own enjoyment.

If you dont know, there is a debate about whether or not the english dub is better for anime, or the original (Japanese dub with English subtitles) is better.

Personally, i prefer the japanese dub.

But i never hated the english dub, i never thought of anyone that watches it as losers, i just accepted that people can like what they like.

But then, for some reason, i just suddenly didn't want to accept this at all.

I don't know how to describe my mind and way of thinking currently, but ill just have to describe it in this way.

I thinkmy mind changed into that of an ignorant loser who cant accept that people likes things he doesn't like.

I know i should just try and shed off my sudden sensitive mind, but i just cant.

Whenever i would hear the english dub, i would move my arms around, whispering loudly to myself about how much i hate it, and when i would see people say that they loved the english dub more, i would just get pissed off.

Of course, its a stupid thing to get mad about, but i know its stupid, but it seems that my mind just forces me to be sensitive and rude.

I don't know when it started, all i know is that it was not long ago.

Whenever i would watch feminist's, vegans, or fat people say that their way of living is ok, i would listen to them, and actually think to myself if they are right or not.

Sometimes, a vegan can be good and civil, but other times they can just be the worst.

But now, whenever i would see any of these people talk about how their way of living is ok, i would just flail my arms around, whispering loudly to myself that they are wrong no matter what.

I think i got scared of becoming someone people hate.

I think i got scared liking something i myself didn't like.

I feel as if it will be permanent, if i watch a good english dub, i will forever love it more than the japanese dub, but i dont want that to happen.

If i listen to a feminist say that all men are stupid, im scared that i would actually think of her as right and just become a simp.

I know that I'm scared, i know that i became stupid, i know that i became much more sensitive than i was before, but i cant change it for some reason.

I just wanna be the person i was before, not a smart person, but a person who would always listen to who or what he hates, and actually think properly whether or not he should hate it or love it.

This has also altered my intelligence, i remember watching the first episode of fate/zero back them when i still was a civil person, i remember understanding everything kerei, Tokiomi, and the father discussed.

But when i decided to watch some other stories, such as movies or series' with the same style of dialogue as well as complicated plots, i never managed to understand them.

I remember watching all of attack on titan a long time ago, i understood everything, from the eldians, to the history of the titans, ymir, and the walls, but now, i cant even remember the name of a main character in some movies.

I cant connect things well anymore, i cant understand things anymore, i just became child minded, ignorant, sensitive, stupid, and a degenerate.",17Oct2020,1
179,"I have no idea who or what I am anymore, nor do I know how to help myself. I’m a 17 year old female, and I might as well list my mental health diagnosis’s before I go on:

- Depression 
- OCD
- GAD
- Trichotillomania
- Nightmare disorder 
- DDD
- ADHD

But even with that, I am unable to function normally.

I take medication, but it doesn’t stop my imagination from growing. I feel like I know things people shouldn’t be allowed to know. I rarely talk through anything my head expresses because I’m unsure of how to explain something even I don’t understand. Am I going crazy? I’m not sure.

182,"Just wanted to write a post sharing my experience with anxiety, and more pertinently, paroxetine’s place within it.

I’m 26 now and have had severe anxiety since early teens, worsening over time but always arriving and passing in swaths and phases. It has manifested it self in different ways over time, both in interpersonal relationships and work life. It has affected my ability to maintain relationships and keep a steady job. Over time I have developed a better reasoning and response to it but the chemicals that cause it have always won - no matter how much better I became at coping or reasoning with it.

I’m yet to be clinically defined, but I’d say my anxiety leans more to social anxiety than any of the other forms. I am a very outgoing, social, and communicative person. Which makes having anxiety difficult, and doesn’t always correlate to who I am or what I like in my life. I love to be around people, meet new people, and relate to people. But my anxiety doesn’t always feel the same way. I’m of the belief that the chemicals in my body that display themselves as anxiety do not define me, but are mere passengers that are along with me for the ride. And within that I find not only solace, but strength. Nobody chooses to have anxiety, but we can choose how we relate to it, and in turn how little or not it defines us. We all share the same fears, some just don’t have their body’s reminding them of it everyday.

I’ve been on Olanzapine since early teens at varying doses, currently at a sweet spot of 7.5mg. I’ve tried propranolol and sertraline for my anxiety but they did not work for me, for me being the important factor. Different medication works differently for different people, I think.

Up until paroxetine I’d been on CBD at increasing strengths since late 2018. I’d say it worked for me around 60% of days. Which I felt was enough, and that was the best I could do. I was wrong. I was scared in all honesty, of the side effects of starting any new medication, but with lockdown and Covid-19 my anxiety became unbearable, so I spoke to my GP and I got started on 20mg Paroxetine. 

2 months later and I’m yet to put together into intelligible words how incredibly happy I am, but I’ll give it a go and hopefully it will speak to some of you. Firstly, the fight or flight sensations I’d feel walking past a stranger in the street have gone, the dread I’d feel at going outside have dissipated, the overwhelming sense of fear feels like a million miles away and I no longer live within the storm. I feel care-free, as broad and unaware as that sounds. The things that felt to me so all consuming no longer cross my mind. My response to my usual anxiety triggers has been dampened and eased and I feel calmer, stronger, happier, and healthier.

That is my experience on paroxetine. Medication isn’t always the answer, a conversation can be just as powerful. A hug, a message, or a gesture of understanding can offer undeniable resolution. But sometimes medication can help, and it isn’t anything to feel ashamed or upset about. I must note that I’ve been happy since I recovered from severe depression as a teenager and I am not taking Paroxetine for those reasons, just simply for my anxiety. I hope this is of benefit to some of you but I must add that paroxetine worked for me, personally. But there is help out there that will work for you, and you shouldn’t feel weaker in asking for it.",17Oct2020,1
183,"Hello!
I’ve recently been struggling with homicidal thoughts.
Like for the past 2 months I’ve been hearing voices in my head whenever someone makes me angry.
This voices tell me to kill the person. At first I didn’t like this voices, because I thought that they were going to make me something that I would regret.
Now when someone makes me angry, I don’t hear the voices anymore, but I just get an INTENSE urge to kill the person that made me angry. I’m constantly getting thoughts on how to kill this person, whenever I imagine a situation to kill them, I have started laughing, it’s just too fun to imagine this.
I don’t know if I’m just going crazy at this point. I just feel the urge to kill them.

I think both of my parents are emotionally distant. whenever i try to hug my mom she rarely hugs back or gets annoyed and snaps at me because she’s “busy” even when she’s just on her phone. but when i ask her to hug me or show affection she says i should be doing that because “i’m her daughter” so i don’t know when it’s a good time? it’s hard to talk to her too, i feel like she doesn’t really care about what goes on in my life and always mocks me when I talk about something that makes me happy. she always just makes weird faces when i talk really happily about something. my dad and i have always had a strained relationship so i don’t like being affectionate with him, there’s just too many bad memories. a couple times a year he will try to hug me but i just shove him away because i don’t like it, it just feels weird and uncomfortable. He’s hit me several times before and has anger issues, so he blows up every couple of months and breaks things, etc, so i find it hard to show affection to someone like that. It’s terrifying when he’s mad. he’s a little easier to talk to though but i still can’t open up to him either because he doesn’t care much for my mental health or uses something I tell him against me. he’s always on his phone too, talking to other family members and friends, he makes at least 5 phone calls a day. he doesn’t make that much time for us. I’ve always liked my mom more but now i’m coming to realize she isn’t really any better than him. Honestly they’re both toxic for each other. Their marriage is obviously broken and it’s clear that they don’t love each other, at least anymore. they seem more like coworkers. when my moms dad died she cried for 15 minutes and then went back to her routine and she hasn’t spoken about him since. she didn’t really seem to care after that which is what shocked me. my dad made a joke about my grandpa a couple hours after he passed and my mom didn’t even seem fazed. i mean what normal people do that? i just don’t know what to do, it feels like i’m the only emotional one in this household but I always get made fun of for crying or even just being human. everyone acts like a robot. there’s so much more but this is the main stuff i can fit, i’m just tired and drained. i really don’t want them to find this so i’m using a throwaway.",17Oct2020,1

191,"Hi Everyone,

I'm a 28yo guy who most people would qualify as introvert. Although I'm I can enjoy being by myself at times, I sometimes get very frustrated and annoyed at myself when social situation occurs and I feel I'm missing out a bit at having an as developed social life as I'd wished. I would like to engage people in conversation, but for a starter it does not come naturally, it is quite often that I have nothing to say, idea/words just do not come to my mind but even if I have something to say, it is often like I'm imprisoned in between 4 brickwalls, and the more I try hit against it to get through it and start talking, the thicker it gets and the desperately harder it becomes. Sometimes I manage to say something despite it, but by the time I manage to produce sounds, it is after so much efforts and under so much pressure that I often say things completely stupid/weird which makes me pass for a weirdo, and I end up regretting that I talked at all.

 I notice this happens even more (intensely) with people of interest i.e. girls i'm interested in or for  important person I should network with for work related reasons. And as well the only times when I really felt free from this walls, able to be the my full self, with ideas and words flowing freely is when i'm on MDMA. Although be assured, I'm aware drugs are not sustainable way to deal with this issue long term.

I'm starting to wonder if it is not a sign of a form of anxiety, but it's hard for me to tell, as I have no point of comparison but myself. And despite this, I've managed to be good at studying and professionally, although on the friend level it's not the greatest and on the dating level I've definitively missed out so much because of my ""paralysis"".

I was wondering if other people had experienced the same kind of feelings, and if yes, if they have somehow succeeded to manage it, break the pattern and if so how. Thanks for your help!",17Oct2020,1

209,"Last week I posted in this sub about the conversation I had had with my son about the panic attack he'd had while while we talked on our weekly podcast. The feedback I received was not only amazing, it was extremely reassuring for me as a father. As a lot of you probably know, being a parent is a job that comes without instructions, and we are always questioning whether we are doing a good job or not, whether our decisions are affecting our children positively. I want to thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for all your heartfelt comments meant the world to me

After we recorded the podcast, he kept having some issues with anxiety. A couple of times he began to panic and think that he was getting sick, or that something was wrong with him. I stayed up with him throughout the night on Saturday to make sure he didn't feel alone. The next day I made an appointment for us to go to go to a sensory deprivation tank, which has worked for me in the past in reducing anxious thoughts. He loved it and it really seemed to help. The rest of the week we took it easy, and discussed going to a therapist. He agreed. He has been doing much better since then. 

We ended up recording our following podcast a couple of days later, and we discussed the float tank and some of the reasons for his anxiety, in a lighthearted way, trying to seek answers, not to judge or offend. If this can help you or someone that you know, please feel free to share it them. Thanks again for all the love!!!

There’s a cyclical nature to my moods and whenever I manage to get out of the fog, I have the tendency to convince myself that it’s finally over and I’m completely normal, yet there’s a continuation of a pattern in my life that I simply can’t ignore anymore. 

I was treated for dysthymia when I was 18, and tried an anti-depressant that seemed to make me self-destructive at a level I couldn’t have imagined. I’m a naturally squeamish person, yet began slicing up my arms and legs. I ceased taking the medication shortly thereafter and tried a few others that either had no positive effect or made me feel like a zombie. 

I haven’t been able to hold down jobs for very long, spent the vast majority of last winter in bed, etc. I honestly don’t know where I’m going with this, I just really want to be healthy again.

I already regret calling there because its just so terrifying to even think about talking to him on Tuesday before work. Struggle with extreme Mood Swings for several years, feeling nervous all the time, having extreme Up and Downs all the time. Not for longer episodes, only shorter time. Changing for small or no reasons at all. My Thoughts are so chaotic; I have trouble to focus or think about something in an objective way. Its getting worse and I am barely able to get trough my work. There is so much mental pressure that I feel trough those chaotic thoughts and emotions and its so hard to stay calm on the outside. I have a past of self harm since my Teens and only stopped around one year ago. Still have thoughts like this and even suicidal ones. So especially with that I don´t know if you should say this. I remember reading somewhere online that you shouldn´t say that, even if you get ask because they could get you in a hospital or something. I don´t have plans and I have them for so long that I am kind of used to it. Weird to say. No matter its just extreme and not ideal if you already have trouble with impulse behaviour.

 I am worried that he is not going to take me serious. That those mood swings are normal, hormones or whatever especially as a woman. I struggle so much with it and I am constantly worried to hurt someones on an impulse, to do something I regret. I often have times where I feel so upbeat, not really happy more like you are on drugs or something. I am such a shy person but at those times I talk a lot and say stuff without really thinking about. On other times I feel like I am the worst person ever, a lot of self hate, can´t do anything right, get extremely angry at other people for small reason. Really have to hold myself back to not scream at other people, stay nice at work or not just leaving in the middle of work. I don´t know how to do it, what to say on Tuesday.

My dad is going to leave tomorrow. He works abroad for 11 months sometimes. He usually visits us around three times. He left in January to go to Mali. We hadn’t seen him since, until he arrived home last Friday. But tomorrow, early in the morning, he will leave. He’ll return in January, completely. 

I mean, the fact that he will only leave for another three months calms me down very much. I already stopped crying. But then I start again, because I realize that he will be gone. That’s what I keep forgetting. He won’t be here. It hurts. At least he managed to be here on my 18th birthday on Wednesday, because I really didn’t think he would make it. I’m so grateful for that. Because he didn’t get to be here when I graduated from school. 

Damn, I don’t know if I should just calm down or keep crying. I still can’t realize he’ll leave again. When it comes to those things, I’m kind of numb. When my mum said he will make it to my birthday, I only realized he’s actually coming home when we were at the airport and I finally saw him. It’s the fifth time he had to work abroad, so… yeah. I’m used to it. 

One time things were so bad I had to cry in front of my cousin (she’s the person I respect most over everything and everyone, so that’s something I really avoid doing). This time the most I cried was when we were told he had to work abroad again, although he hasn’t even been home for a year yet. And when he left I cried. But when he was gone, my emotionality towards this kind of just turned off. 

Well. It’s kinda late and I don’t know what else to say. Goodnight everyone",17Oct2020,1

233," I'm not in a great place right now. I feel like I'm failing in life and I have no friends. Even the things I used to be passionate about, I just can't seem to care about these days. I'm having suicidal thoughts pretty much on the daily. I went to see a general practitioner for constant fatigue and pretty much the only advice she gave me was to go to therapy for my depression. I know I need serious help right now but I'm way too scared to try seeing a therapist.

I've been Baker Acted twice, once when I was 15 (I'm almost 21 now) and then again a year ago. I'm not sure how mental facilities in the rest of the US are, but here in FL they're absolute nightmares. Both times I was told I'd only be there for 72 hours at most and both times that was a lie. The first time I was in a hospital I had a panic attack, and to calm me down the staff decided to get me a prescription for a sedative and then locked me in a room by myself until I stopped crying. Last year the staff in the hospital constantly belittled me and played weird mind games with me. I swear the doctor in charge of my treatment was actually a sadist. After he realized I'd get upset when he said I couldn't go home he started pausing after saying things he knew would upset me and looking at me like he was trying to watch my reaction, waiting for me to cry. I don't know if I explained that well but it felt pretty disgusting. I also found out after I got out that second time that they violated several of my rights in terms of allowing phone calls and consenting to treatment. Hospitals don’t help at all with mental health. It’s just this bizarre mind game where you always have to smile and laugh and pretend everything’s just perfect until they decide that you’re acting “normal” enough to gain the privilege of not being locked up like a rat in a cage. I still have nightmares and flashbacks about what happened to me in these places.

After both hospital trips, I’ve tried seeking out psychiatrists and therapists to help me get back on track. Through both my experiences in the hospitals and with outpatient doctors I must have interacted with dozens of psychiatrists, nurses, NPs, PAs, therapists, and counselors. I think there were one or two that I felt actually listened to me, tried to be compassionate, and were any good at their jobs. I'm so sick of trying to put my faith in somebody who’s supposed to help me improve myself, only to be treated like garbage and just feel even worse than when I first got there. I’ve had psychiatrists unapologetically laugh in my face when I tried to explain how I feel. I want help so bad, but I just can’t trust anybody to give it to me.

One of the things that scares me the most about potentially going to see a therapist is the idea that if I say one wrong thing about having suicidal thoughts, they’ll cart me off to the mental hospital again. I just can’t go back to one of those places. Even though I’ve had suicidal thoughts, I don’t have a plan and I’d never act on them, in large part because I’m afraid of failing and then going to a hospital again. I’ve begged people not to send me to a hospital and told them it’ll just make me worse, but they don’t listen. I can’t be honest with my feelings or I might have to go back again. I can’t trust anyone and I’m so sad and depressed and scared. I don’t know what to do. I just want help.

234,"This may be really triggering for some people as it's about childhood  s*xual abuse, I really dont want to hurt anybody so please if you feel uncomfortable, please dont read this. PLEASE DELETE IF NOT ALLOWED









As a child, I dont remember many times where I was alone with my dad. There was a couple times, all filled with him going on (heavily intoxicated) and either telling me that I was his favorite child, or that he hated me and wished I was never born. Always either showering me with love, or treating me like garbage

I dont remember being completely alone with him, which scares me because my mom was always telling me that he was always taking me places without my brother and sister. Usually the beach or river

As a freakishly young child, I was always really hypersexual. I was 7 years old, maybe even younger, staying up all night and watching porn to get off. Its terrifying to me that I even knew what it was, or knew what to do. Around this time, I had some major behavioral issues. That's whenever I started harming myself, starving myself, doing alot of self destructive things. I regularly told my mom I wanted to die, and I do remember trying a couple times. My mom never took me to see a doctor about any of this behavior, as she was afraid that they would take me and my brothers away. 

That's another thing that scares me. Was she afraid I'd say something? Something that she knows, and I dont? 

I recently tested her, and told her that I didn't remember alot of my childhood. I asked her if we went on a trip to North Carolina, to go see some zoo. This never happened, we were poor and could barely afford our power bill. She said we did, and that I had a blast. She made it sound like we were a perfect better homes family, and everything was some kind of happy ending fairy tale. I did this to see if maybe she'd try to convince me that I did remember my child hood, and that I would have remembered if something happened to me
 
She regularly makes up things that happened to try and fill in the gaps of things I don't remember, or convince me that my child hood was perfect. My siblings have told me multiple times she was lying about half of the things that supposedly happened

Nowadays, whenever my dad's in the room, despite logically having ""nothing"" to be afraid of, my brain shatters into a panic whenever he's around. I get such a level of anxiety that I can't breath. 

I just wanna know what's wrong with me, does this seem to be something I should be worried about? Should I just leave it alone and be grateful that I can't remember if something happened? 

I wanna find a way to remember, so I can move on. The past couple years, my life has been nothing but hypersexuality, drugs, alcohol and self destructive behavior in an attempt to get this weight off my chest. I don't even know what the weight is, but I feel like if I did, then I could work through it and move on. I just feel stuck, all the time. Constantly I feel like I can't move forward in life because I run into this brick wall of fear, like whatever happened is holding me back. 

I can't have a healthy relationship with sex, eating, self love, none of the things that you think would make a person happy. They all just make me anxious. I just wanna find out what it is, beat it, and move along.",17Oct2020,1
235,"I (35F) have a younger sibling (33F) who is struggling with a plethora of issues and is now violent. She suffered a spinal injury five-six years ago and became heavily dependent on smoking hash to relieve the pain. Over the last three years, however, she's started blaming others for all her issues. First it was our mother who, I know, was abusive while we were younger as she herself was going through the loss of her husband, our father, at a young age. She has always been rude towards everyone but it's gotten worse and worse. 
 Earlier this year, she said she felt paranoid around all the family and it was stemming from her past life experiences that she remembers. She became obsessed with watching WWII documentaries and movies, going so far as to say she was the wife of a holocaust survivor and she remembers her time in the camps. And now, over the last three months or so, her anger has been directed towards me. She has decided that I raped her, and took food out of her mouth as a child, which just completely blanks my brain. She knows I've suffered sexual assault and she uses that to tell me that I'm the one who rapes and not the one who got raped. She says horribly vile things with such conviction and two days ago, she physically assaulted me badly. My mother refuses to get help because she's worried about what people will say (Asian society).

236,"Hello, I'm just posting here to get some advice about my brother. He's 29 and I'm 26. 
My family and I are a little worried about his mental health.

I'll give some background. My brother only left home once when he was 18 for a few months to go to college. He studied a science course but couldn't manage it academically. Perhaps he was to young to be by himself but he's never tried to move out again. He's lived with my parents ever since. He has shown very little interest in pursuing any education but my parents almost forced him to get a degree in a community college here just because if it was up to him he would do nothing at all. He complains a lot about his lack of employment, a relationship, the fact that he has no friends outside of immediate family but he makes only feeble attempts to fix his situation. 

He has always been absent minded but it seems to be getting worse. For example he likes to drink tea, so he'll make a cup, maybe drink some then forget he made it and make another. This leads to sometimes 5 or 6 cups of tea lying around not even touched. It's a small thing but it just strikes me as very strange. He can never remember his phone number, always loses his phone and needs help recovering his passwords for things all the time. I find this frustrating sometimes because in my mind it can seem like he's being lazy in a way. Believing everybody around him will fix his problems. My mum does his washing and I feel like this is doing him a real disservice because he just isn't developing any survival techniques. 

He can seem very emotionally distant. This is something people would notice when we were in school. People would usually interpret this as unfriendliness. He also has painful social anxiety. The sort where when I'm with him in town and he's talking to someone he doesn't know where to look or where to put his hands etc. 

He has a degree in Digital Media and is looking for work in that field, but as awful as this is to say, he isn't ompetent with the things you would need to be to find employment in that. And he refuses to get anymore education or training meaning that he'll basically only be able to do minimum wage jobs, but he keeps failing the basic aptitude tests to get in, even though I don't believe that he's unintelligent.

Another thing worth mentioning. My oldest brother, 44, who's married with kids and has a stable well paying job in the city invited him over a few years ago to find work and get on his feet. He was living there for a few months, he would say he would go to interviews but never did and here's where it gets really weird. While living with them I guess he left his computer on and my sister in law finds that he's trying to become some kind of online porn star with his webcam. Totally inappropriate while you're living rent free and with a family with young children. He's had sexual hangups which have confused us now for years. All I've been told is that he somehow damaged his nether region years ago and is somehow impotent or something.
He's got an obsession with some very bizarre genital modifications too.

I just want him to be happy and functional. But I have no idea how to approach him about it. Any advice is really appreciated!",17Oct2020,1

Eg 3 days ago I was at an ice cream shop and a bunch of guys just went and told me ironically: ""hey big boy lemme tell you something"". They were about my age. Today, 2 dudes on a motorcycle were passing by when I was at the sidewalk trying to cross the road and the passenger just says ""hey"" and they give me the middle finger. No previous contact or relation to me at all. I am continuously made fun of and ridiculed when Im just trying to be nice to everyone. There hasnt been one person in my entire life taht I didnt try to be nice to, even if I found them kind of off at first glance. Om the other hand everyone at school makes fun of me. My life is literally hell and I cannot do anything about it. My mother prevents me from taking self defense lessons, because if the fact that ""Ill not use them wisely"". Im so tired of being alone and having no one feel like me. Even in my friend group Im the guy that is constantly made fun of. My best friend who once was ny best company found a girlfriend and Im alone yet again, while inside my friend group there is a kid that has been bullying me for 7 years. Im so tired of living in this hell",17Oct2020,1
242,"I haven’t felt like myself for a few weeks now and I have no real reason for feeling like this just super super down and normally when I’m like this I can snap out of it especially when I hang out with my friends. Recently I feel uncomfortable with my own friend group and like I don’t belong with anyone and have nobody to talk to even though I know logically I do . Nothing has happened to me, my home life is fine other than my brother moved away and I feel lonely in the house alone with my parents sometimes. I feel guilty for feeling so down all the time because nothing bad has happened to me and when friends ask me to talk about it I say I can’t because there’s nothing to say? I just feel really upset and not myself and don’t know what to do about it. I can’t even cry I’ve tried I feel more numb than anything, I started burning myself with cigarettes to try and deal with this strange feeling but after I feel like I’m being dramatic because nothing is wrong with me at all. I don’t know how to get rid of this feeling and go back to normal it’s taking over my school life and making me quiet and sad in school and not just at home like it normally was. It sounds stupid but I feel as if I’m being over dramatic when I try explain my feelings to someone because I’ve never experienced any trauma and nothing bad has ever really happened to me.",17Oct2020,1

I am a 15yo person w/ OCD, GAD and I am autistic. I likely also have PTSD, AvPD, PPD and Social Anxiety Disorder. I self harm. I have therapy and a psychiatrist and I take fluoxetine daily.

I often have thoughts of being beaten up, assaulted, attacked, stabbed or sometimes even sexually assaulted and I don’t know why. When the injurious thoughts are not about sexual assault, I actually find some sort of solace in imagining myself injured. But when they are about being assaulted like that, I feel disconnected and empty. I feel like I need more trauma to “count” as being traumatised if that makes sense. I don‘t feel like what happened to me was “enough”. But the thoughts unrelated to sexual assault - I cannot explain why I find peace in the idea of people stabbing me or beating me up.

These thoughts are almost debilitating. I am always thinking about some stranger bursting into my classroom and holding a knife to my throat or stabbing me in my stomach. I never die in these scenarios - I am always somehow invincible or immortal or unable to die from my wounds, so I do not think that this is passive suicidal ideation. 

I don’t know how to tell me therapist this either.",17Oct2020,1

247,"Hey all,

So I have become fairly close to my niece (15f) over the several months (gay uncle here so we vibe) and last night she confessed to me via text that she has been binging. She says she will binge then not eat for some time (maybe even days though I am not sure). She also confessed that she has been having some pretty severe anxiety to the point of shaking (how she described it) and I need advice about how to help.

I have been trained as a crisis worker so I am aware enough to know how to talk with her, not push her away, and intervene with her immediate family if I feel she is in danger. Right now though I don't want to involve my sister though in order to respect my niece's privacy. The kicker is that I know my sister used to struggle with bulimia which I vaguely hinted at with my niece but she was unaware so I didn't go into any detail beyond the fact she had an ED in the past.

My question to everyone here is what do you think would be the most effective intervention from my point in the relationship? I have thought about sending over some resources but don't quite know where to start on ones relating to EDs. I am also very ignorant on the subject in general, does her saying she binges potentially imply that she purges as well? Are those two things often correlated or do they often exist separately? I recently saw my niece in person and she does not appear to be under or overweight (from a very untrained eye).

Any and all help/advice would be greatly appreciated.",17Oct2020,1

249,"When a particular inciting moment occurs, something mundane and rather usual, my thoughts, sometimes, jump to extremely unlikely and somewhat dark conclusions. Sometimes, not all the time. For example, I’m lying awake in bed at night. I hear a soft creaking sound coming from the corridor, at the end of which lies the front door. I automatically think, ‘Oh, there must be an intruder. *le gasp*’

Or there was this other time at the supermarket, I was just standing around waiting for my dad, who was doing something. I had my mask on and I dropped my glasses while adjusting it. I had to carry them for the rest of the time we were there because I didn’t have the case on me and I was basically just kind of uneasy and wanting to get the shopping over and done with and then I pondered the possibility of someone sneaking up behind me and grabbing me.

I know what you’re thinking. But in fact, these thoughts don’t really bother me. It’s just the fact that I have them that’s kind of emotionally inconvenient I guess or something, like I don’t actually think these things are gonna happen or whatever just— idk why I’m posting this but I thought I’d just do it idk. I guess my previous post on this subreddit is kind of more important but whatever byee",17Oct2020,1
250,"Has this happened to anyone else? I always seem to get a sense of imposter syndrome when I'm coming to terms with my mental health. 

It happened too with depression. I spent years of self harm &amp; suicidal thoughts thinking I was just being dramatic. Even though I never told anyone about my feelings, I felt like I was lying to myself and just being dramatic? 

Then I went to therapy about a year ago after a very difficult night. The night itself is pretty hazy, I don't exactly remember what triggered it but I remember hurting myself with a knife, getting high &amp; then driving around at the middle of the night (completely reckless and selfish I know). Then I found a hotel a few hours away from home and stayed there. I really thought that was going to be the night I ended it all. I'm sure I spent hours on the floor staring at the walls in this hotel. I managed to snap out of the haze and finally decided to arrange to see a therapist. After a few sessions with her it became so obvious, I wasn't 'faking' anything. I was actually depressed. It was hard to that admit to myself and even harder to talk to her about it. 

She did help me a lot with my anxiety issues and things but I never told her the entire truth about why I was there. But as I opened up a little bit it was clear the issues I had were 'real'. Still no one knows about them, yet I still feel like an imposter? Even though I have memories, scars and regrets to remind me that I'm really not okay, why is it still so hard to accept? 

The possibility of being bi-polar has been on my mind for a few years. But again I thought I was being dramatic and just feeling the same as everyone else does. But as I started to notice patterns or see a 'shift' in the way I feel, act and perceive things. It made me wonder more and more that perhaps this is more than just depression &amp; anxiety. 

Honestly I don't know what to do about it. In a world where although mental illness is being destigmatized, it's also been blown up with words like 'depression', 'bipolar', 'OCD' used as casual descriptions rather than diagnoses. I think personally I use this change in perception as a way to keep denying the real issues I have. I know I don't want to admit I have anything 'wrong' with me. If I do then I have to move to the next step of facing my issues and starting the journey to fix myself. I was on Zoloft for around 4 months before I just stopped taking them (why? I honestly don't know. I can't remember why I stopped even though it was only a few months ago).

 It's just really hard always being at war with my own mind. Forgetting, denying, ignoring. If I can't even trust myself to believe these problems then how can I trust anyone else? 

Maybe I'm just blabbering on because it's 2am and I can't sleep.",17Oct2020,1
251,"I’m a 20 year old male and I’m depressed. I feel like I’ve been depressed for a long time but haven’t admitted it. I ask myself why and half the time I don’t even know the answer, I have high hopes for the future, I’m working really hard to achieve my dreams, and I would say my life is going at a fast pace but I have no one to share it with, no one to support me at my lowest or share my happiness when I’m at my highest. Unlike those around me, I have no support system. I give a lot of support to the people I love but I feel it’s one sided, I feel like no one cares about what I do, why I do, how I do, and mostly importantly how I feel. Whenever I reach out to someone and express how I feel (which is hard to explain), my problems aren’t valued and I come across as weak and incompetent, when in fact I know I’m strong and competent, so I choose to bottle it up (not sure if that means I’m emotionally immature). I don’t want to talk to someone who can help me understand my problems (therapist), I want someone to genuinely care about my problems, and to ease this weight unconditionally.

255,"Hello, I'm just venting.

For context, in my country the COVID situation is very bad, specially in the capital, the city where I study. Today, I moved there because I couldn't continue with online classes, I have to physically go to class. I've been very anxious about it. 

But this is about something that happened when one of my five flat mates texted me if I wanted to have dinner with them and a couple of friends in the living room. I don't usually accept, but I didn't want to be rude and it was only dinner, I guessed it would be ok, so I agreed.

Half hour in and they were partying. If my anxiety wasn't high enough, it got worse because I'm a very socially awkward person (sometimes I wonder if I am asocial, I also fit so well in the autistic spectrum, never diagnosed as such, but that's another story). I couldn't talk to them except very basic words, I just smiled and nodded. I started feeling dizzy, my heart was beating so fast, I got a headache and everything became confusing. I couldn't even form real sentences in the texts I was sending to my friend. They told me I was having like an adrenaline peak (or something like that) because I wasn't having a panic attack, but I was on edge for a very long time.

For a moment, I felt like I was watching a scene from a film and I wasn't there, I didn't feel like I was physically there. It's so weird, I don't think I've ever experienced anything like that. At least that I remember.

I wasn't able to communicate. I somehow owe money for a pizza to some guy I don't know and I wasn't able to ask him if I could giving him the cash instead of sending it online. My flatmates tried to make me dance and drink, and I just stood there. This sounds odd, but I could only watch them dance, watch the colorful lights and that's it.

Finally, my mind went to a different place. Suddenly I felt sad and wanted to cry. They wouldn't leave me go, I just ""locked"" myself in my room (I don't have keys, my landlady forgot and I can't leave the house or lock my door). My head hurts like hell now, but my anxiety isn't there anymore.

I'm just going to hide, though I feel bad doing this (they aren't my friends but still).",17Oct2020,1
