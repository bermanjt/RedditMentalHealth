0,"I suffer from panic attacks pretty often - I always feel like my heart is pounding too fast and I start feeling like I’m dying. I got a tip from my cardiologist awhile back that I thought might be useful to some of you - He told me to go buy one of those fingertip oximeters (they’re like $20 on amazon) and slip it on very time I start feeling a panic attack coming on.

It has helped me to calm down a little bit because I can visually see my heart rate and oxygen levels during an attack. Actually being able to see that my oxygen levels are above 90% and my heart beat isn’t going as fast as I think it is has helped me a ton.

Typically I just try my best to focus on my breathing, and watch the oximeter for a couple minutes. It doesn’t totally take away the panic attack, but it has definitely helped me during one.",24Aug2020,1
1,"Tw: panic attack, anxiey, persevered loss 

I had a panic attack a couple of days ago and it wasn't that bad as mine go but afterwards I had a big anxiey attack over finding my girlfriend because my brain had decided she could be hurt or dead.

When I couldn't find her I ended up convinced she I'd dead and deleted lots of my messaging apps.

I believe she is dead even though I have no evidence and have cut all ways of her communicating to me that's she safe and I'm too scared to redownload any of the apps in case there really is now messeges and it'll force me more into this cycle and I'll lose all hope. I know I'm being irrational but I can't stop thinking and believing she's dead.

Any help or advice or anything about what his might be would be greatly greatly appreciated",24Aug2020,1

3,"Hi, so I've been trying to get into journal-ing but I'm having a tough time because of how incredibly long it takes to type things out on a phone keyboard or write them down so I wanted to find one on PC. When I google it all that turns up is a lot of websites for phone apps and something called MoodPanda which has a limit of 200 characters, there's no way I can properly reflect on my feelings/a whole day in a single 200 character message.

4,"So I’m going to preface this with my partner will NEVER strike me. I know that I’m safe I know that these behaviors are simply triggering previous trauma responses. 

Once again during a fight today my bf threw down his headset he punched the side of the couch he asked me if I was happy did I get what I wanted? 

He has a friend that literally instigates fights and we’d come to an agreement that when I’m over he just wouldn’t game with that friend. Today the deal changed I guess. Didn’t ask. He just decided his friends gotten better and the old compromise was moot. I asked if the guy was really sorry- because he had been the inspiration for some serious negative thoughts. I even pointed out I didn’t agree to the new compromise and wish he’d talked to me.

Then he went into “I don’t know why I can’t game with my friends” (mind you’re it’s specifically this ONE friend) I don’t know why I can’t have private conversations with mine? Because we are both sensitive because of shitty past experiences and knowing the others boundaries we’d agreed to respect them. 

Lately I feel like again all the compromises he and I had in place are falling away but his restrictions are strangling me. I don’t think he’s happy anymore and half the days I’m afraid of pissing him off. 

I am his submissive I think the first necessary change will be uncollaring myself he’s in no place to be a Dom. Maybe when we are healthy again we can entertain a dynamic but right now I’m considering self harm (don’t worry I have healthy coping mechanisms I’m just gonna circle to) and it wouldn’t be fair to him for me to pretend we are ok.",24Aug2020,1

8.13.2020

An open letter to no one. A message in a bottle, thrown into an electronic sea:

My deepest, darkest secret is that I'm bat-shit crazy. Or I have been for most of my adult life...

Schizoaffective Disorder is a serious and profound mental illness. Mine hit me when I was about 19 years old like a tsunami out of the blue, obliterating all that stood before it, violently sweeping my life off its tracks and onto some infinitely stranger, more difficult, and far less-traveled path. The person that I was then, the boy just beginning, did not survive. Nearly overnight, he became someone else completely. The experience, from my perspective, was as if the entire world suddenly just \*changed\*. The skin of comfort and familiarity was furiously scoured away to reveal dark, ominous, threatening shapes lurking beneath. All that I thought I knew, even about the simplest and most fundamental things, was torn away, no longer valid, replaced by an insidious uncertainty, confusion, and most of all, fear. Unbeknownst to me, my perceptions, my thoughts, and even my feelings twisted and distorted like reflections in a funhouse mirror, presenting a world that I could no longer fathom. Ordinary things became impossible, and impossible things became ordinary. I could suddenly see the demons hiding behind everyone's eyes, filled with animosity and disgust and hatred and wrath. I could suddenly hear the messages cleverly folded into their deliberately innocuous-sounding words, a secret intended just for me, whispering threats. People I thought were friends suddenly turned into enemies. People I thought loved me suddenly wanted me to suffer. Paranoia. Delusion. Before long, this became all I could see or hear or feel. It grew in intensity until it became unbearable, then it grew even more.

&amp;#x200B;

Me, I just ran. Even as some part of my intellect was telling me that what I was experiencing was unlikely, even impossible, my perceptions were showing them to be real nonetheless, with my emotions backing them up. That first time, I just headed straight to a bus station, picked a place at random, half a country away, and went there, never to return. Some time later, when it happened again, I ran again. 'Fuck-This-I'm-Out' was my first form of self-treatment. Like this I went from city to city, from state to state, crisscrossing the country, trying to outrun my demons. To this day I couldn't tell you, with any degree accuracy, of all the places I tried to hide. Homelessness became a familiar starting and ending point for some cyclical pattern that seemed to impose a hard limit on how much I could do before an inevitable collapse. I perfected the art of starting over, and did it again and again... trying to stay one step ahead of those shadowy figures that I knew would do me harm, that wanted me to break. And always finding myself right back in the same hellish place.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, I sought help. I knew none of this was normal, so even from early on, I tried to get treatment. I started seeing doctors, but to no avail. I've probably been through hundreds of hours of therapy. I can't even remember the names of all the medications that I've tried. A few of them worked to some degree, lessening my symptoms somewhat, but never really making them go away \[not to mention how each one seems to come with some dastardly new side-effect: This one feels like your head is stuffed with wet cotton, this one makes you faint at random, this one makes you impotent, etc., etc.\]. I took them all, but none of them worked for real. Mostly, if it weren't for the side-effects, I wouldn't know I was taking them at all.

&amp;#x200B;

And through it all, I tried to live a life, or at least something \*like\* a life. I eventually learned the trick of mimicking normalcy well enough to function in at least some basic ways, but it'd only work if you didn't look too hard, and even then only for a while. I've had many jobs and I always did well... but always hiding the fact that I could hear between people's words how much they all despised me and how no one wanted me there, I'd see in their gazes their disgust and contempt. I'd pretend not to hear or see them as long as I could, and felt like a failure when I eventually became overwhelmed and had to get away. Ditto with college. Twice. Ditto with every normal endeavor, really, that required me to engage other people in anything but the most rudimentary ways. I discovered how to be the perfect stranger, never letting anyone get close enough to really see me, or me them. In spite of this, I managed a \[very\] few relationships, or as close as you can come to one when you are shattered and broken, utterly incapable of things like real trust, or the ability to feel loved or any kind of sense of belonging. Mostly I think I just hurt and disappointed people who tried to love me, and who never really understood when I would inevitably treat them like THEM, who in my eyes they'd eventually become. I didn't so much live life as survive it the best I could, between the breakdowns, between the collapses. And I came to think, honestly believe, that this was just my lot in life, all that I could expect. My delusion and intense self-loathing told me that this is all I deserved and that, ultimately, all of this was my fault. I just wasn't trying hard enough. Everyone's life is hard, but they all managed it. The fact that I could not became proof that I was fundamentally lesser than other people. Much less. Like a mistake, or something that's really not supposed to be here. Something that didn't really count or matter at all, that the whole world wanted me to go away. And I lived like this, dysfunctional, half-in and half-out of a bad dream that I couldn't wake up from, for a very, very long time. Most of my life, in fact.

&amp;#x200B;

And then, relatively recently, something unexpected happened. My umpteenth doctor prescribes me my umpteenth medication, something new, claiming fewer side-effects... and for the first time, twenty-some-odd-years after being first diagnosed, it actually works. For real this time. Just the right two tiny little pills, and the world, impossibly, changes \*again\*, right before my eyes. The dark miasma of uncertainty and fear inexorably drifts away like noxious smoke in a breeze. The surface under my feet eventually thaws from something like slippery ice to something like solid ground, and for the first time I can gain purchase, stand easily on my own. The dense gravity of deep, relentless depression gives way to a new kind of buoyancy. The ever-present whispers and shadows are gone, giving way to something completely new and unfamiliar. The doctor tells me that this new thing is actually normalcy, real normalcy, at least from a brain-chemistry point of view, and that this is what most everyone else has been experiencing this whole time. I find it difficult to accept... this new state seems almost too good to be true. I feel like the difficulty level of the whole world turned from ""Hopelessly Brutal"" to ""Just-hard-enough-to-make-it-fun"". Surely such a thing can't last. Surely this can't be real. But, I am assured, it is. Chemistry is amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

So here I am, now. Old, scarred, worn, but finally unfettered. Looking out at a new world that seems ripe with possibilities, doors upon doors just waiting to be opened. I feel for all the world like a man who has spent his whole life in prison, mostly in solitary, suddenly being set free. Or a slave from 1750 being transported to 2020 and unshackled. I'm almost overwhelmed with options. I feel like the world is now accessible to me in a way that I've only just begun to comprehend. I feel good every day, and I feel like I \*deserve\* to feel good every day. Without my illness to give it power, I honestly don't think that there's anything in this new, far gentler world nearly strong enough to push me off my square. Ever again.

&amp;#x200B;

True, I'm somewhat strange, because my life has been so, and I lack the experience that others take for granted, because my own experience has been what it's been, but all-in-all, I'm okay. Better than okay, really. I suspect that carrying an impossibly heavy burden for so long has made me strong. Very strong. Doing so much on my own has taught me self-reliance. Solitude has taught me introspection, and with that comes insight. All that self-doubt has left behind a thick deposit of confidence. Now that my fears are rational again, in most regards I am fearless. Decades of delusional inquisitors picking me apart has inadvertently yielded a sharp sense of self-awareness. Desperately trying to make myself \*worthy\* of things like kindness and compassion has made me kind and compassionate. I look in the mirror with the same incisive vision that used to only show me my deepest flaws and failings, and now I like what I see, even deep down. I'm beginning to realize that the crucible of madness has left me with gifts.

&amp;#x200B;

And that's not all. It also left me with tools... a particular set of deeply ingrained habits that began as survival tactics, but now, I think, may actually be virtues : I mean what I say, I say what I mean, Im honest, I keep my promises, I don't talk about people behind their backs, I don't throw shade, I don't engage in drama.... the list could go on. These are not hollow words with me, they're the end result of a lifetime under a microscope, with every infraction, no matter how small, harmless, or insignificant, being fodder for demons, always used against me, added to a list of justifications of my torture. Apparently, inner demons make ruthlessly brutal but effective teachers, and I have learned a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

So what am I going to do now? Well, my current plan is to gorge myself on warmth and love and happiness and joy and pleasure. All that which was so lacking in my former life. I feel like my life was stolen, so now I intend to steal what's left of it back. I finally feel free to be who I am, and who I am has always been an artist. It's what I most love to do, and brings me joy and pleasure, so that's what I'll focus on doing. For me, art has always been a means for examining things, my own inner workings and mechanisms, trying to reach understanding. And there's much I still need to understand.  My studio is where I pose questions like these, and where I strive for resolution. Who knows, maybe I'll make something that speaks to someone like me, someone on that stranger path. And maybe I can let them know that though it is less-traveled, it has been traveled by \*someone\*, and that he made it all the way through.

&amp;#x200B;

Holy shit. I really think I made it all the way through.",24Aug2020,1
6,"So for as long as I can remember I haven't enjoying anything I do in life, throughout school I was one of the smartest in my year but hated every lesson type, this carried on until I eventually just stopped going to school altogether, nothing could make me, my parents took me to therapists which all just said that I was lazy and that everyone had to go to school and do things they don't like, when it eventually Xmas time for me to go to college I had no idea what I wanted to do as there was no subjects I enjoyed and wanted to commit to, my whole life I've never had a job in mind that I would want as my career, but my parents insisted I go as it would be a new start and I could get back on track of keeping a schedule.
So I took a course and didn't enjoy any of it, it was a 3 year course and not long after the first year I started missing more and more lessons as I just wasn't enjoying it at all.
This was all a few years ago now, since then I've had a few jobs but none that have lasted more than a couple of years because of how much they have burnt me out, I'm 27 now and the only thing I have ever remembered actually enjoying is playing on my pc and streaming, I have wanted to commit to streaming for 10 years but have never been able to afford my own pc until recently, but it's the only thing I've ever enjoyed.
I'm well aware the likelihood of me becoming anywhere near successful as a streamer is slim to none so I don't know what to do, I don't enjoy going out, I don't enjoy going on holidays, I don't enjoy spending time with friends.
I'm currently unemployed due to redundancy from covid, but I just keep thinking what's the point is getting another job when all it does it make me carry on doing everything I hate in life, people say they work hard to go on holiday and enjoy life, but I don't remember the last time I enjoy my life, so I am I just lazy or is there no point in me trying anymore?",24Aug2020,1
8,"So I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for 4 years now and last year I was diagnosed with bpd and ptsd as well. I’ve tried meds but only low doses and I see lots of counsellors and doctors. I’ve always been able to get through it and keep pushing but I’m getting older now and people expect more of me but I feel like I’m just setting myself up for failure. My anxiety is bad to the point where I can barely talk to people at all and avoid people at all cost. I get scared and shake really bad when I try to have a conversation with someone so I just avoid it. I’m very unmotivated to take care of myself or clean up after myself, I struggle to get sleep at night, I break down after every social interaction, I get panic attacks constantly, have nightmares and I think very negative about myself. 

My mom always tells me to think positive and write in a journal everyday and to think of things I’m grateful for. I’ve been trying my best but my motivation isn’t good so I don’t do it a lot but I have been trying. 

I’m supposed to be going to college next year but I’m very scared and I’m trying to think positive but honestly I have no clue how I’m going to do it. My mom said if I fail or quit she’ll kick me out.

I display most/all symptoms so I reached out to my Gp (which is of course my uni one but I go to uni in a different city from home) &amp; he said it seems to be a relatively mild case. If that’s true then obviously I’m glad it’s mild but it really doesn’t feel like it. 

I am consumed with so much self hatred, paranoia &amp; fear that I honestly feel like I’m going crazy &amp; have even considered voluntarily referring myself to a psych ward. However he said psychotherapy is the form of counselling used to help deal with bpd but the waiting list in my uni city is estimated a year &amp; a half.

20,"I just started my senior year in high school a couple days ago and it hit me that I’ll be starting college in less than a year. For the longest time I’ve told friends and family that I plan on doing my undergrad, going to med school, and eventually becoming an OBGYN. Of course I would love to end up in this profession because I have a passion for babies and wanting to help families on their journey to parenthood but I don’t think I’ll be able to get through all those years of schooling. 
The reason I settled my hopes on this ambitious career is because I feel this immense pressure of having to make something important with my life. I’m the oldest and only daughter to two hardworking immigrant parents who have sacrificed everything to make sure I have everything I need and I feel like spending 10+ years in secondary schooling to become someone important in everyday society would be the only way I could repay them and show them that all their efforts weren’t for granted. 
I get it, I’m still young so I probably have no idea what I’m talking about and I can’t see the future but I don’t think I’ll be able to make it through all those years of schooling. I used to be ahead of my peers in elementary and middle school but by the time high school rolled along, everyone caught up to me and at this point, I already feel burnt out academically. I’m planning on doing my undergrad but I just don’t know what I’m going to do after. The though of med school scares me just because I don’t know how I would handle the stress and I feel like if I didn’t end up passing med school or flunking our, I wouldn’t know how to properly handle that failure.

22,"This might be a little all over the place so please bare with me.

I've been going through a difficult time right now mentally. I'm struggling to find a way to get myself out of it. I've been here before and I know that I'm capable of doing that. But when you're in the thick of it, it can be hard to see the positives in all the negatives.

 I've struggled with depression and anxiety for years going through ups and downs and I take medication for it. I've tried a number of different things over the years since I was about 15 and I'm 27 now. The current medication I've been taking for about a year now. It did help at first, but I feel like it hasn't been for a while.

I recently lost my job a few months ago. Part of this I think had to do with my mental health. I have been trying to find something else with not much luck. I haven't been making any income at all which has also taken a hit to my self esteem. I'm lucky enough that I have family that supports me and let's me live with them. I really don't like having to rely on them though.

 I'm having a really hard time reaching out to people for help. Having feelings of being unwanted and unneeded by my partner after not seeing him for a month. Like he's just done dealing with me all of the sudden. We've been dating for a little over a year now and we would see each other at least once a week up untill a month ago. He's pushed me away and been distant from me. Which in turn has made me feel even more sad/depressed.
 
I've tried talking to him about it, but he just acts like there isn't anything wrong. Not seeing the person you're dating for a month!? And it isn't a long distance thing either, I mean we're talking a 20 minute drive. He said it's normal to him but it's not to me. Not to mention he almost never calls me and hardly ever texts me anymore. And if he does reply to texts then he's always short and takes a long time to reply. This wasn't a problem untill recently. Am I being too needy? It's making me feel crazy.

It's like he can't be bothered. Or it could be something completely different. Maybe he just doesn't love me anymore and doesn't know how to tell me? Maybe he's hiding something from me? He can't seem to give me a real reason other than being too tired or wanting to just see his friends instead.

I'm all for taking time for friends and family, but he never tries to make plans with me anymore or invite me to anything. I then tell myself that he probably doesn't want to be around me while I'm struggling with my mental health. What I don't understand is how he could be that way when he had a similar situation not long ago and I was there for him. 

All of this has been making me want to drink just to feel better, even if just for a little while. And I know that's an unhealthy way to deal with things. I just really don't know what to do anymore. It's like I'm stuck in this weird limbo.

All I want is to be happy. And I don't know what I'd do if I lost my partner too. I can't help but feel like my life is falling apart. It's like I'm stuck and don't know how to get out of it.

I told him that I wasn't gonna go because I feel like I had to time to just recoup and he said that I had to go because it was a dinner for me and I can't just not go .. I started crying because I just felt so depressed and the thought big going just wasn't not a good time to me. He told me to stop crying and the only reason why I didn't want to go was because he wasn't going .. and when I told him how I feeling that I just felt depressed all week and he made a remark like ""yeah and your always in pain""(I hurt my back at work three weeks ago). Like I'm just doing all of the to get attention. When I told him I'm not just doing all of this for attention he said I know but I have my own problems to deal with I don't need to deal with your you expect extreme sympathy and I don't have the energy for that. I told that wasn't the case and that sometimes I need someone to talk to and to listen to what I have to say I don't expect anything.

I don't know I just need alone because I feel like I have no one to talk to. I just need someone who I can talk to and that will listen I feel sooo bad right now about everything I almost resorted back to cutting because I've just been so anxious and stressed and depressed I can't handle anything right now and it's soo hard to get through the week.",24Aug2020,1
25,"I asked for help in another group and was just told to try therapy. We're BOTH saving up for it but can't go right now. I wanted to ask others who might be going through the same thing or have some insight that I'm overseeing. 

The husband and  are about to hit our  one year mark and yesterday we finally had the conversation and  mentioned the divorce word. I hated it. I was the one who brought it up  but I'm stuck now and not sure how to continue.

We  both have mental health issues. He struggles with  bipolar/depression/anxiety and I deal with the same plus fibromyalgia,  sciatica, chronic fatigue and agoraphobia. We've both agreed that  therapy will help and our saving up so we can afford this. I'm on medication again(Gabapentin for my fibro and anxiety) and used to take both Effexor/Wellbutrin but the side-effects(major anger) were too much for me. Being manic, I tend to overspend and try different projects at once(that I bever finish). 

While  I was going through an episode, I told him I wanted a separation and  maybe a divorce if we couldn't fix things. We both brought up good  points and it let me see that I'm not always right and there are things  that I can do to improve as well. He mentioned that I never want to spend time with him or give my full attention. 

I'm  seriously introverted. When I get home from work, the last thing I want  to do is talk. I want to decompress and just zone out on the laptop for  a bit. He lets me do this but brought up how it seems like I'm never  happy to see him or want to do things with him that aren't watching  shows. With my physical issues, doing things together is hard.  Occasionally we go for walks or bike riding but I always end up needing a  few days to rest after. I can't even stand up for 20 minutes without  getting dizzy and nauseated.

**What can I do to save this?**  Any fellow chronic illness peeps still making their relationships  better/work out? I know I need to fix things but don't know how. **Can two people with bipolar even remain together?**",24Aug2020,1
26,"Before the quarantine started, I was working what I consider to be a good job, making what I consider to be good money (with benefits). However, I felt like I could not enjoy it because of my physical and mental health. I was drinking nearly a bottle of wine everyday and abusing adderall. When I got laid off as a result of the pandemic, it was extremely tough at first. I was still drinking everyday and abusing adderall; I felt like my weight was out of control; I was going through a tough time in my relationship; and I was dealing with anxiety and felt depressed everyday. 

One morning, my girlfriend woke me up with a positive pregnancy test. I'll admit that I was a little fearful at first, with the pandemic and being unemployed. When the initial fear passed, I felt bliss. I'm going to be a father. I'm gonna get a chance to do a better job than did my parents. That's a beautiful thing. I am wholeheartedly looking forward to being a father.

The good news inspired me to ""take control"" of my physical and mental health. I started drinking kombucha; I started taking CBD for my anxiety; I started exercising and reading everyday; and I started reaching out to friends and family. For a few weeks, I felt empowered. I was losing weight; my self-esteem was increasing; I felt less lonely; I drastically cut my drinking; I haven't taken adderall in months; and I felt like my relationship was improving. 

Though I've been making better health decisions, I've felt extremely lonely lately, which is weird for me because I don't usually feel lonely. I often find myself alone, as an introvert, but I don't find myself feeling ""lonely,"" so long as I'm working 5 days a week. As an introvert, I feel like going to work 5 days a week is more than enough socializing for me. So I think the quarantine has a lot to do with my feeling lonely. Another weird thing is I've been by myself less lately. Yet, I still feel lonely. Like I said, I started reaching out to friends and family. That led to me hanging out with my best friend and my family several times. 

I also think part of the reason I'm feeling lonely is because I've been reading a lot of sociology articles lately and I feel like when I try to share them with the people I love, I don't get the reaction that I want. And it's understandable. You can't expect other people to be passionate about the same things you are. I majored in sociology because I honestly just love the field of study and I think it's of the utmost importance. I understand that it's unfair to expect others to be passionate about what you're passionate about but that doesn't help with the feeling of loneliness. 

Anyway, this is me reaching out because I feel lonely and I'm wondering if there's anyone out there who can relate. I've also decided that I'm going to apply for Medicaid and seek mental health services, as I would like to address my mental health situation before the birth of my first child. I feel like I'm making the right decisions but it's just not helping kick that feeling of loneliness.",24Aug2020,1
27,"TL;DR I am having anxiety in multiple aspects of my life, and they are all feeding off of each other even though I know that they don't even make sense. How do I keep from having self destructing thoughts?

I have been feeling very anxious recently, and after some self reflection I have pinpointed it to a few reasons and added some realizations too. I am looking for any advice you may have on how to make myself feel better. I am currently looking for a therapist, but I would appreciate any additional insight.

1. I am currently unemployed and in the middle of a career/industry shift. It has proven to be very difficult due to the field being extremely competitive and covid taking away many job opportunities. I went to a top university and worked at a top engineering company in the past. I see my friends currently with their jobs getting promotions, etc and it is very hard for it not to make me feel like I am falling behind.
2. I am very entrepreneurial and want to start investing in real estate, but it's impossible to do because I am currently unemployed with no W-2 income. I am working a part-time, remote customer service job that covers my monthly expenses (student loans, bills, etc).
3. I am currently living at home with my family, who I love very much and get along with well. However this also makes me feel like I am falling behind for some reason.
4. I am started seeing this guy since I have been living at my family's. I find myself obsessing over whether or not I am ""good enough"" for him and keep picking out my insecurities. I do think that maybe this is stemming from my unemployment and feeling like I don't have my life together enough because of this. He is older than me (only a few years) and I look younger for my age, so I feel insecure that he is embarrassed to be seen with me in public. I know this is ridiculous and most likely not true since he was the one who originally approached me, but I can't help but think that. I am also anxious about knowing where we stand/how he feels about me/where he sees this going. This doesn't even make sense because I don't even know how I feel or what I really want from it. I am pretty content with where we are at now, just taking things pretty slow and being pretty casual. I am also just feeling ugly all the time even though I know I am decently attractive.
5. I find myself getting especially anxious when I am by myself or at home with my family, not with my friends or when I am out. This is the time when my mind starts spinning and the anxiety kicks in.
6. I think that there is just a lot of unknowns in my life right now and it is making my very anxious. I also find myself worrying about the future, and thinking what-if's... what if I don't succeed in my career life to the extent I want... what if my dreams of real estate investing don't pan out... what if I don't wind up meeting someone and getting married and having a family...

Do you guys have any advice on how to keep myself from having these thoughts, and how to stay more positive? I feel that it's just a cycle of my different insecurities feeding into my other insecurities. I at least realize how illogical some of these thoughts are, which is a start... but how do I keep myself from having these thoughts?",24Aug2020,1
28,"I feel like a worthless fucker. I've been depressed since February. I gained a whole lot of knowledge about the world that was terrible for my health. I started reflecting on my life and realized that I screwed up big time.  I also realized I hardly have any true friends. It always feels like I'm the one making efforts. I feel like I am alone in the world. It really feels like everyone I know is fake. I lost a whole lot of self-esteem because of a bunch of events that happened in my freshman year. I stopped exercising and went from abs to fat. However, no one has been noticing this. Why? Because I'm taking out my depression by doing more work, research, and hobbies. As a result, my grades are better and I'm doing really good in my academic career ( I got a 4.0 for the first time). Add that to the fact that its still lockdown here and I'm only regularly interacting with my  parents and a few neighbor friends. Yet, I feel like ending it all. I've been miserable for so long. I just don't know how to cope with this.",24Aug2020,1
29,"I (26F) haven’t had an Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter account since 2012. I joined Reddit less than a year ago and I love it! All this time, I never thought twice about creating a new profile. Until now. 

I mainly want to keep in touch with distant friends and relatives overseas. But the thought of taking selfies and putting effort into my page seems exhausting and honestly, stupid. I wouldn’t even know where to begin.

On the other hand, I see it as an opportunity to connect with people around the world and perhaps discover new interests? Since the start of covid, I’ve been stationed at home. I haven’t been chatting with many people outside of my very small circle. 

I’m torn. It’s liberating and easy to live life without a social profile. I’m not sure if it’s my boredom that’s putting this idea into my head. I know there are negative aspects to social media that definitely affect mental health. At this point of my life, is it worth to start up again?",24Aug2020,1
30,"Hi, It’s a lot easier for me to talk about my problems like this so here we go. 
A part of me envy’s having someone to say “goodnight” and “good morning” too. doesn’t matter if it’s a relationship or a friend or a girl or a guy. I rarely ever have that person to talk too that frequently, let alone even day to day, but being lonely is a whole other post.

I know it might be normal for a lot of other people too but i just want a connection with even one person. i’m still young by some people’s standards but i haven’t felt like i have had interest in talking to someone that much. Or i see they have no interest and i cut it off for there own sake of not having to feel bad. 

It would be nice to have a constant friend and person who’s out there in the world or in the same city that i can talk too.",24Aug2020,1

32,"I'm new to this subreddit, so I apologise if I do anything wrong. 

So, for many years, I've struggled with heavy depression and SAD. I also have Asperger's, in case that may be relevant to the answer I'm looking for. I've always struggled with loneliness, specifically from a lack of romantic companionship (for lack of a better term), and the extremely low levels of oxytocin that entails. I also have frequent sudden drops in interest in doing anything, including things I normally enjoy. I'm not sure if this is covered by Seratonin or Dopamine. I do, however, have a loss in appetite and I get cold or chilly when it's not cold around me. 

I'm a realistic person and I have a very difficult time suspending my disbelief. This means that any time someone says things like, ""It's okay, you're not alone."" when I clearly am, just makes me feel worse and sometimes flat out angry. Due to certain gripes with how society treats men in the dating world, I have chosen to give up dating entirely years ago; however, this is not what I'm talking about today. 

What I want to know is: as a single man, what kind of supplements should I look into? I do also have low Seratonin and dopamine levels as well, though I'm not sure if it's wise to take multiple different supplements at the same time.

Have any othe single men tried supplementing their low feel-good chemical levels, and if so, what were the results and/or side effects?

I have read that Oxytocin is good for men in relationships to supplement the oxytocin they are passively receiving through normal contact, but it can have bad side effects if you have trust issues and whatnot. I just want to do some research before I purchase something that may not even work or make things worse than what they already are. 

And please refrain from cookie-cutter, Hallmark replies like:

1. Practice loving yourself
2. Meditate
3. Get out more
4. Spend more time with friends
5. Read some BS self help book
6. Remember that you're not alone.
7. etc.

These are just platitudes and not actual solutions to someone who has a realistic perspective. I just want the facts before I purchase anything. 

Thank you for any support provided",24Aug2020,1
33,"I feel bad all the time now, and my apartment is a mess, I used to be anorexic and now I binge eat daily.
I’m going to get drunk after work tomorrow because I can’t quit for some reason.
I just get stressed and feel like I need a drink and today I was stressed, so angry actually.
I wanted to break something and call in sick to work because I reached my emotional threshold by like 9:30 am. I managed to eat way too much just with 5 dollars because I lost my bank cards.

I’m completely broke and I’m going to buy yet another bottle of vodka.
I need to stop. But last time I went to mental health treatment they made my situation worse, made me feel worse. So when they said they think I’m maybe ptsd with a personality disorder and not bipolar I decided to go do the online tests... since I wasn’t getting any answers there. Apparently I fit almost all of them. All except antisocial personality and narcissistic.
I asked mental health for a copy of my file before they closed it. They said they would call me back in regards to me getting copies of my notes and they never did.
I never got the file I have a right to have, they won’t give them to me, and I’ve been seeing professionals on and off since I was 7 years old.
They thought maybe I was autistic when I was 7. I’ve never been to a specialist, I want to look at my file and see just how many diagnoses they have thrown in there and their reasons why.
Or descriptions of my behaviour that could be accurate or false. I want to see what’s in that and they won’t give it to me.
I quit going to therapy after my therapist made me feel worse and quit taking lithium too.

Now I feel crazy, like I should be deemed disabled whether I like it or not and pulled from work before I have some kind of emotional break down there.
My job isn’t hard, I’m a cashier, I’ve had worse jobs. I’ve had bad employers.
These are decent people so now it’s the customers that annoy me, but it’s every little thing in my life that annoys me. I can’t stand other people.
I’m always thinking about all my mental health issues and how messed up I must be, and how mad I am at things that might have caused ptsd, yet I wish I could just be a kid or a teen again.

I feel like I need to starve myself, quit drinking alcohol, and clean my apartment if I want to feel better next month, but I keep failing for very emotional reasons.
I was doing that, and then after two weeks of it I got such a bad cold I was way too sick to work and then they made me self isolate because of covid.
Then all my hard work went down the drain.
I ate a lot while I was sick and the money I was saving was spent on food and surviving while isolated, when it was over I got drunk because I was angry about it.

And my 23rd birthday is actually in two weeks, and not being skinny, not dressing how I want, and not feeling accomplished on my birthday makes me depressed, and it feels worse every year.
Right now I’m at the highest weight I’ve ever been but feel like I don’t look that different. But I’m short, it’s bothering me.

I don’t want to let my emotions control me but I’m so sick and tired of everything and I get suicidal a lot, I even considered hurting myself this morning while I was at work because I was so irritated.
I just feel like a crazy person.

I always had a few weeks off here and there from work with natural disasters and getting laid off or vacation time stuff just to regroup. Once I hit this wall. But now with covid that is not an option, in fact I’m so lucky to have these full time hours right now.
I’m grateful but I feel like my mental health and home life is in such a mess that it maybe isn’t as important as fixing my eating habits/issues, working on all my mental health issues, and quitting alcohol.
Almost like rehab. But I can’t afford to do that, and I have no one who could help support me.
In fact, if I went to my family or a doctor saying my binge eating bothers me they probably won’t do anything because I’m not obese. And I wouldn’t care about quitting alcohol if it didn’t stop me from losing weight. 

I’m uncomfortable at work, at home and in my body and with my mental health issues.. I don’t know where to start and everything seems too small to make a difference or too much to do at once.",24Aug2020,1
34,"Already posted this to r/offmychest, but only one person read it, so it feels better to put this here.

A few years back in grade 7, I made a google document and shared it with a bunch of people who had the same name. I won't go into details, but in short, I insulted people based on their choice of profile picture without even realizing that I was insulting them. I guess I'm right in some respects by saying that past me was a stupid kid. It got me in trouble with my school principal, but I never told my friends. When I went home, I knew my parents would be mad, and I still remember my flight instinct kicking into high gear. I wanted to run away, to hide myself from the world and let nature swallow me up. They didn't shout at me, they spoke calmly, and somehow that hurt so much more. I didn't understand why I did the thing in the first place, and I remember scrambling for answers to try and rationalize my actions. I was subconsciously angry at the world and unknowingly lashed out. I made a vicious joke because nobody would be hurt, right? I was possessed. Every single time, I drew up a blank. Nothing. No answers for my questions. That document stayed up there until the end of the month, where I changed it to an apology and hoped that the dozen or so people could find it in their hearts to forgive me.

Of course, after a while my parents stopped giving me flak for it. But I never told anyone how I really felt. Because when I got upstairs after being chewed out, for the first time in my life, dying didn't seem that bad. I had been depressed a few times before (And I mean real depressed, not internet depressed) and had considered ending my own life but didn't have the will to do it, thank God. This time, I wanted to die not because I had lost the will to go on, but because it felt like some sort of punishment, a worthy justice against those I had wronged. Perhaps I thought that my death would somehow make them feel better. I wanted to pulp my head against the wall, to do something, anything. I almost craved negative feelings from others, and considered calling the cops on myself several times for internet hate crimes. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this is where my self deprecative humour was truly born. In depression, it was more of a comfort, a thing we could laugh about that could brighten my day. But here, it was me cutting pieces of myself off and laughing about it on the outside while my soul bled on the inside. My self deprecation is much more lighthearted, but I imagine that this was its inception; my own suffering.

That name made my heart leap for months afterwards. Every time I would hear it spoken or written anywhere, I would tense up. I wanted to curl up and die somewhere. After that was over with, I feared people's opinions. Thinking about it now, someone's choice of profile picture isn't a lifechanging thing, but I felt like I'd killed someone's dog. I imagined that whenever we would meet, they would resent me deeply, and would bully me relentlessly in an attempt to get me back. I used to fantasize about the teacher calling everyone's names in highschool, and hearing that person's name and dreading when my name came around, imagining that person looking at me and thinking 'this is the person that hurt me. I'm going to hurt him back.' Like I said, looking back it seems silly that someone would resent me for something so small 2 - 3 whole years ago, but once again; self torment and fear. It went on and on and on. My game master-ing for my friends' D&amp;D games got sloppy because I was always obsessed with the idea that I had ruined my future forever. I couldn't trust my friends to give me the sincerity of the situation, they might just play it like a big joke and call me nuts for making a big deal about it. And my parents, who I probably needed more than ever, were distant. I was alone in my own bubble of misery. I had been depressed before, but it hit me in full now. While before it was covering up the hurt within using a mask of fun and happiness.

Now, I was empty. I'd passed beyond sadness now. I was just floating in limbo. My room became my personal stronghold, the one safe place I could go in the whole world. School was good, and I had my friends, but I was living a lie. At home, I couldn't talk to my parents, so I would sit in my room and do nothing for hours on the weekends. I was waiting for something-or *someone*\-to come and take the pain away from me.

I don't know what brought me out of depression. I had a tendency to relapse in and out of it. I haven't the faintest clue what saved me. But if I had to guess, I'd say writing. I'd been writing since the end of sixth grade, and I loved it. When I finally got my technology privileges back, I would write. Whatever I wanted, whatever I could. Bad fanfiction. Story ideas. You name it. And in the middle of all this darkness, I found it. My light in the dark. Writing. *THIS* was my safe place in life. My reason to live. This was the thing that catapulted me out of ""Nothing matters"" and into ""Nothing matters, so let's have fun!"". It seems weird, but if I had to guess what made me really fight back against all the thoughts of negativity generated by one thing, it was writing. Strange that it wasn't people.

It's been a while, and I've largely gotten over it. I still write a lot, and Quarantine has allowed me to go bananas. I am currently in the process of writing much less bad fanfiction as a sort of runner up to becoming an actual writer. These stories can be an outlet for all of my thoughts, fears, and ideas. These stories are a puzzle, a collage of interests and experiences. These stories are me. Even if I don't contribute anything major to the world, I can confidently say that regardless of what happens... it will be one hell of a ride, and writing will help take me to the ends of the Earth and beyond metaphorically and literally. Even if I lose all my friends, all my family, everything I own, and those two reddit followers who are there for some reason, I will always have my stories.

38,"I’m finding everything hard and overwhelming and I’m in panic mode for most of the day.

I have caused a lot of problems this year because I didn’t do what the shadow people told me to do.
I’m being threatened by them daily. They’re taking over my life more than they ever have. I feel unsafe all of the time. I stopped taking my meds because they have a sedative in. I can’t sleep because night time is the worst and I have to be prepared. The Shadows are everywhere and when I accidentally fall to sleep, my head is filled with horrific visions. I’ve tried to protect the house and my family. I check everything any time I hear a noise but there are so many noises. I try to keep what is happening to myself and not worry the people around me. I’m terrified when I leave the house because the world is so unknown and forever changing. But the house is no longer safe too. I just can’t catch a break. 

I used to exclusively only deal with the shadow people, but for the past month there has been a pig man who has weaselled his way into not only my house, but my bedroom. Standing, watching. At first I wasn’t scared of him (I’m guessing on the gender) more pissed off that he’d entered my safe space. He sits on my bed every night intensely watching me try to sleep. But last time I flipped at him, he left for a couple of minutes and then reappeared with a black mass. It stayed in the same ceiling corner all night, growling and just being terrifying. But they never spoke. They have to work together, that’s the only thing that makes sense about them. 

My CPN hasn’t seen me since Covid hit. My meds get brought out and left at the door, she doesn’t know I stopped taking them a few months ago. They diagnosed me with treatment resistant schizophrenia, and admitted that meds won’t help, so why be take a drug that doesn’t work for you? But if I’m being honest, I wouldn’t tell her a thing anyway. As soon as I say things are a bit shit they have me involuntary sectioned even if I’m not at risk. They’ve point blank said they refuse to have me in the community if I’m not medicated.

My relationship is starting to mess up. When I’m with him the shadow people fuck it up. He gets stressed because he’s worried because he can see I’m preoccupied and terrified I try to only see him for small amounts of time because I can’t mask things for hours/days on end. But he seems to be the only person that has noticed.

Things have never gotten as messed up as they are right now. It’s been almost 4 months since I self harmed and a little over a year since I last tried to kill myself. I’m so proud that I’ve lasted so long and I’m trying so hard to stay incident free. But I’m struggling. I always listened to the shadow people, and because I did, they kept the world and the people I loved safe. I have so much guilt living with the mess that I’ve caused.",24Aug2020,1
39,"I'm 15 and I get horny thinking about having sex with 12 year olds, only though if they look like they're my age or like a year younger. I don't act on it (masturbate) because I know it's gross and just thinking about it makes me super uncomfortable and disturbed, but sometimes I feel like I just have to. I hate pedophiles and they disgust me, me thinking about having sex with children makes me sick and it's cruel that some ppl have the audacity to treat a young girl in an inappropriate manner. But when they look super close to my age, I feel like as I do when I normally find a girl my age attractive and hot. I don't know what to do. Is this normal to feel like this? I'm never going to actually try to have sexual intercourse with a young girl, that's just cruel and disgusting and no young girl deserves that, but I feel like masturbating still.

43,"I finally got help for my anxiety and depression 2 months ago. I was making a lot of progress and I was doing my best to initiate things with the friends I was neglecting. They said they missed me and we could make plans so I was really happy about that, and then I see them hanging out without me all the time on social media. They'll be together right down the street and not let me know. I wonder if they ever think of me or if they didn't invite me on purpose. It's just awful to be disregarded by everyone around me, people only text if they need the answers to homework. I just want to be close to someone.

My ex that I was trying to be friends with told me he self-harmed and it was my fault. He said, ""I hope you're satisfied."" I have been so messed up since that happened around 2 weeks ago. I tried to hurt myself today but I could take the blade out of my razor and gave up. 

I just want someone to suddenly text me and tell me it's ok and they care about me and want to see me. I've been having thoughts of suicide but I didn't do it because I don't want my parents to have to find my body. That sounds really morbid but it's keeping me alive currently.",24Aug2020,1

45,"I feel like people are always trying to figure out why I’m so quiet and reserved, especially my friends and they try to make sense of why I’m like that by like my astrology moon and rising. The true reason I’m reserved and don’t let people in is because when I was vulnerable in the past, people acted like they understood but threw it right back in my face. So many of the people that I told how I felt would always bring up my depression in an argument or even go ghost once they find out I’m mentally ill. I’ve gotten so much better over the years keeping people at an arms distance, emotionally, and making sure that if I’m ever down, to keep it to myself, share with a therapist(to a certain extent because I feel judgment from certain therapist), or rant on the Internet.",24Aug2020,1

Backstory: I was homeschooled until 3rd grade by my mother for a few years and yer friends for the other. I believe that made me a very secretive person and alongside that I don't like to ask for anything. My mother was what I would say was abusive but called is in her word ""Ass Woopins"". I have sisters who each seem to have gotten their own type of personalities and lives. However since I was the only boy in the house my mother wanted me to be the man of the house. Which meant being the usable tool around the house. If I was asked to get one thing I was now to bring everybody something. Everytime we went shopping my mother would go to stores to get clothes for herself. Make me hold the onces she picked while my sister went to shop for I think one outfit each or something. Alongside that the clothes I wore for sone time were hammy downs from one of her friends sons.
I am starting to realize a lot of mental problems. Such as a lack of personality, very high anxiety, and maeby more.

Besides the eating disorders, generally its been the same or nearly similar symptoms, just chopped and changed around to make up the diagnostic criteria for each of the above listed diagnoses. The eating disorders interfere because of trouble focusing/jitters, which confuse symptoms further.

I’m diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety, but I’ve been able to manage it independently for the most part.

This year, however, has been overwhelmingly stressful for many of the same reasons we’ve ALL struggled along with some of my very own personal stuff. 

I’ve had experiences with meds and therapy that run the gambit of subpar to really bad, but I truly don’t know what to turn to, and I feel overwhelmed by my fear so, so often. Some of my loved ones help temporarily, but my sense of self-worth and faith in making the life I want is truly abysmal for the majority of my waking moments.

I can’t move forward with my goals and I really, really resent myself for it.

Can anyone relate? Does anyone know what I’m missing?

P.S: I tried certain medications years ago, but not since entering adulthood. They ended up being dangerous for me and I didn’t like how I felt while I was on them.",24Aug2020,1

I’m just. Miserable. 

I was diagnosed with depression and depression sucks, I’ve had it for years but I’ve never wanted to speak to a progressional- bury my head in the sand like I always do.

I had a bit of light. I met this boy, he couldn’t cure me obviously but he brought some happiness but that feelings turned sour. 

He takes me for granted, yells at me over little things and nothing is ever his fault. Our bedroom is dead, he called me pathetic for crying over it. He’s apologised, I’ve apologised. Things still feel... Off.

If it feels like the amount of rights I do by him are ignored in place of the small wrongs. If we have a fall out it’s like that magic that is normally there vanishes, he’s cold towards me for days afterwards. I feel like I can’t bring anything up.

But I still love him and I don’t wanna leave. 

I’ve been stressed over uni, I’ve had no motivation at all in the second half of this year- I’m worried about passing through. I’m so scared of not knowing what’s next but I don’t have any motivation to change it.

I love my family but I’ve distanced myself from many of them, my friends too. I don’t want to live anymore but I’m terrified of a hell or anything worse than what’s already happening. It’s that fear that keeps me alive.

More than anything I want everything to magically get better. I just don’t know what to do.",24Aug2020,1

At the beginning of COVID, I was in a shared living space that made me incredibly uncomfortable (roommates did not take any precautions, acted like this pandemic wasn’t real, etc). Though I had a plan to move back home, I had to wait for my job to end (was teaching at the time) before I made my move.

Being in that situation for 3 full months took a massive toll on my mental health. I built up habits to keep myself safe, but now I can’t break them. I have constant intrusive thoughts about germs, touching things and threat scanning. I can’t stop.

Im a 17(M) and Im passing through a rough situation with my brother 14(M), he is currently with depression and bulimia, mostly those problems came because of my mom who treated me, him and my sister really bad during the years and my step dad that slapped him many times before. We are currently in my grandmothers apartment and I have to take care of him every mornings, so whenever he has one crises attack I freak out cuz I don’t know how to really deal with it, just thinking that he can closely kill himself in front of me scares the f*ck out of me. When I decided to live free of my mom I wanted to get rid of all my concerns and live free by my standards and happy, but having someone that you care so much in such a condition is terrifying and consumes so much energy (physical and mentally) so Im tired of having such a mentally disorder in my life and I want to stay a long time away from my brother and I don’t know if that selfish or the right thing to do.

More details: My mom and dad are divorced and me and my brother are with him, if I go away some time I can go with my mother (thats not some good thing but it can work) or go with my sister (but she can’t be with me for more than a couple of months) I’ll let you guys wrote what do you think of the situation and what should l do.

58,"So, you can call me JB. Few things about me, I have a pretty bad substance abuse problem due to lack of healthy coping skills. I haven't finished highschool yet, had to drop out of highschool to focus on my mental health. Never had a job, never got my license. 

This is kind of a vent but I'd like to talk to some others with BPD if you want, you can just DM me. I'd love to pick your brain.

I haven't been officially diagnosed because I am not fully mature obviously, so there's still a chance that my symptoms could be just severe depression and GAD, or maybe bi-polar. But I was elated when two of my psychologist's (my last therapist and my current therapist) confirmed that all my symptoms point to BPD, I meet enough criteria, I'm just too young for them to know for sure.

Lately I've been thinking about my childhood and how it shaped me into who I am today. I occasionally use psychedelics to help me understand myself better, but the last few trips made me realize I am too young for my drug use. About my childhood, ever since I was probably 9 I dreamed of drugs like weed, lsd, mushrooms etc. But I looked at pharmaceuticals in a very negative light. Unfortunately, that survival instinct is almost entirely gone. I've never even done an opiate, but they seem so bliss I torture my self all the time just thinking about getting my hands on an opiate. But I've already gone down a dark path with Benzodiazepines. Clonazolam, Clonazepam, Flu-alprazolam.

I want drugs out of my life, I want to know who I am throughout my day; my true sober self. I just can't bring myself to do it until I get this fixation out of my head.

I’m having panic attacks right now.

Do mentally challenged people know they are mentally challenged? Is there some kind of test I could make to check if I’m mentally challenged? Could a therapist lie to me saying I’m healthy?

63,"Ever since my sexual assault, I haven’t felt like myself. I feel disconnected from my body and from my thoughts. My general anxiety is higher than usual and I now feel anxious just being around anybody in a one on one setting. I’m paranoid about my safety, the people around me, 
even somebody in my line of sight. . I can’t have anybody around with being more anxious, looking over my shoulder, or even looking for the cause of every single movement that crosses my eye. I feel like I can’t relax unless I’m completely isolated and away from anybody else, regardless of who it may be. It’s hard being around people I care about out of fear of intimacy and out of fear of showing my anxieties. Not only that, but it’s affecting my sexual life as well. After processing the assault and the incident in my head, I was left with doubts and questions about myself after the incident. I don’t know if I’m bicurious and  and scared to accept it, or if I’m triggered around explicit content involving men.  For weeks afterwards, I questioned what led up to the assault, my feelings and response at the time, and a lot of other things. I even questioned what is sexuallity, what specifically turns me on and why? How is that distinguishable and applicable to women but not towards men, even in similar or exactly same scenarios? I became hypsexual, or at least, more hypersexual than I already was. It was difficult being around females, let alone family members, without my thoughts turning vulgar. It seemed the more taboo the idea could become sexually, the more my thoughts were forced down those trains of thoughts. Eventually, some of those thoughts even started with men, even though they were always unwelcomed and left me feeling uneasy and uncomfortable.  I’m uncomfortable around men and don’t understand my thoughts anymore. I avoid intimate or sincere conversations or interactions with everybody out of fear from my hypersexuality, my sexuality, and being put in another vulnerable position again.",24Aug2020,1
65,"I'm going to start off by saying this has to have been the worst week I've ever had.  That's an understatement.  It started last Sunday with my boyfriend, the only one who wasn't toxic or abusive broke up with me after a full day of not talking to me.  I was so happy to get a message from him, thinking it'd be about how much he'd missed me while he was at his dad's cottage, but instead it was a breakup text.  

I don't exaggerate when I say this, I've been in a total of 16 relationships, and 15 of them were either toxic (i.e. cheating or controlling partners), or abusive (i.e. sexually/psychologically/emotionally/physically abusive).  I found myself in horrible situations a lot and I believe that due to my poor mental health and childhood trauma, I attracted a lot of very nasty people.  

The one who recently left me was pretty much a night and day difference from anyone else I'd been with.  He was respectful, understanding, affectionate, and all around a genuinely sweet person.  It was different, I wasn't used to it.  But I loved him with every ounce of my being.  

He got me out of a very bad relationship with a man who was sexually and emotionally abusive towards me.  Losing him felt like someone very close to me had just died, and for the first time ever I felt suicidal over a breakup.  I feel just as pathetic if not more typing that out as I did when I thought about it.  I relapsed into alcoholism (I haven't gone a day without drinking since the breakup), and I've basically just been hiding in my closet and drinking since Sunday.

The same day, following the breakup I called over a friend I thought I could trust while I was home alone.  We drank together, and he started kissing me.  I tried telling him to stop but he wouldn't listen.  I couldn't push him off because I was pretty weakened and dizzy from all the alcohol.  Long story short, I was sexually assaulted by someone who was supposed to be comforting me in a time of emotional distress.  

Two days later, I wake up to my brother crying telling me that there's something wrong with our dog.  He was a little teacup chihuahua and he was six years old.  I rushed downstairs to find him having a seizure.  He seemed to be in pain judging by the whimpers he was making.  I held him in my arms and he never came out of the seizure.  He passed away as I was holding him.  Nobody besides myself and my younger brother were home, so I had to bury him myself.  Breaking down multiple times as I did.

I think I've had more prominent suicidal thoughts just this week than I have in the duration of my life.  I don't know what to do anymore, I've been struggling with mental illness and trauma my whole life and at this point I fear that all I have to offer is constant melancholy and pain that rubs off on anyone who comes near me.  I lost the one person who was ever good to me, the one person who was good for me.  I found out I still had horrible people in my life that I handpicked to be in my life.

66,"I love reading. It's one of my favorite things to do. I used to stay up late reading, went to half price books constantly so I could find new books, and talked about whatever I was reading non-stop. 

Now I barely pick up a book. I have trouble reading anything new. It's like it's too much effort. If I do read, I read something I basically know by heart and can just skim. 

If I do get over my hump and read something new I'm overly judgemental about it. Either I'm upset with the character, the story line, the author. It's like I have no patience for any of it. And I just stop reading. I'm still buying books, and putting stuff on my must read list. But I never even try to open a book. It just makes me sad. 

I know this is a common side affect of depression. But I've never been diagnosed. I don't even know what steps to take to find out. I tried to reach out to two different clinics, but the waits are so long just to start. I actually lost an opportunity to get a diagnostic because I couldn't make an appointment in a two week period (bad work schedule), and they kicked me off the wait list.

67,"Hey, I just wanna make it quick since it's currently late.

So, recently I've noticed a couple of things in my life and I'm beginning to wonder what the hell is wrong with me or if it's completely normal.

A few months ago, something bad happened that cut me off a very big chunk of my friend group and I can't even go a day without thinking about it. I wouldn't have been suspicious if these thoughts haven't lingered for so long, I often find that just thinking about these things make me really upset and can totally ruin my mood for a while. It doesn't help that something tied to it happened recently.

Adding onto that, sometimes I will be as happy as a lark. I'll giggle and laugh and be as energetic as possible, but then I'd watch one thing and my mood suddenly just plummets. It doesn't even have to be sad, I often find that a lot of these things that make me happy are the things that are making me feel dead inside. I just can't help it, I just suddenly look in the darkest spot I can find and focus on it (when I'm not even intending to do so).

I've also become increasingly more angry, flipping out at things that I really shouldn't be flipping out at and becoming so much more easy to trigger. I keep getting angry at stuff that really shouldn't bother me at all.

And I've also got to mention that I've also been thinking a lot about hurting myself and others, not emotionally but physically. Although I don't find it too likely I'll hurt myself, I also think that I'll most certainly hurt someone else. 

I am fourteen as of this post, so it could just be due to how I work around this age. I'm just also skeptical as everything that has happened that I've mentioned in this post doesn't happen to any of my friends (all of my friends are around my age). I just don't know if the bad and sudden sadness I get everyday is just a part of growing up. Tell me what you think it is and what I should do.

69,"My best friend since childhood is the most amazing person I’ve ever met. When we were kids she we both dealt with eating disorders but we didn’t talk about it among each other. I knew some days she wouldn’t eat but she hated to be pushed and her family constantly pushed her and so I tried to be there for her in the way she needed.

As we grew she struggled with her identity a lot. In high-school she finally felt like she found herself more in what would typically be considered a “hippy” lifestyle. I don’t like calling it that and neither does she but for the purpose of this text it seems easiest to describe. We became friends with very different groups of people but we recognized and supported each other’s differences - becoming even closer. She is someone I will always want in my life. Starting in high school she has also started to deal with some serious depression. I have as well and we constantly talked about it. What it felt like, how to help, etc... she once went to a therapist but they recommended she start taking medicine and it has completely ruined her opinion of therapy. She is terrified of being told the only way she can be happy is by taking medicine. 

We are in our mid 20s now and while always dealing with depression we both found ways that worked for us in how to deal with it. 

The real problem started about a month ago. Now I’m not educated on the different types of mental illnesses so I’m sorry if I say something wrong but I’m trying not to! We both live in different towns and don’t talk all the time (but when we do it’s like we never left) and so I first noticed on Facebook. She was posting things that were very long about who she is and what’s she’s been through in life but they were very disconnected. Usually the beginning of the story did not make sense with the end of it. She posted about 5-6x a day. They started getting more and more aggressive. She had planned on coming to visit me and I had been hoping to talk to her about how she was doing in person because I knew her depression had been worse for a while. But the day she was supposed to meet me she posted something very angry about how she isn’t okay and she’s only ever been alone. Talking about how she has always wanted to kill herself and the only thing that matters is that she’s alive today. 

I tried to help by talking to her but I accidentally said something that was unknowingly triggering and she got very mad at me. It’s been two weeks since then and we haven’t talked. I know other people who have been in touch and she seemed to be better and I did reach out once to tell her I loved her and was sorry and she was very receptive saying “I was in a very bad place”

Now, however, it’s happening again 10 fold. She is saying people are watching her and that her phone has been tapped by the people she was living with and was very close to only two weeks prior. She said she almost died and killed herself but they won’t commit her because she isn’t directly threatening to hurt herself or others. I feel so at loss. I love her so much but she won’t talk to me and I know I can’t help.",24Aug2020,1

71,"Hi there, my first post, hopefully this could help someone..! 
Something I’ve been having trouble with is valuing my successes and my hardships, and I think I recently figured it out. If I had ever achieved anything (good grades, job, medal at tournament), I would brush it off and say I could and should do better. If I was ever having a hard time, crying, I would invalidate my struggle by saying “other people have it worse, I am in no position to complain”. It was horrible, and I felt like there was no meaning to anything I was doing anymore...

Until my dad shared some wise words with me over some coffee, my notebook stained with tears as *I told him about how hard my day was, yet how it was nothing compared to his*. **“Everyone plays at their level of difficulty. Your problems *matter*, given your age and position in life. Don’t compare yourself to me, or to anyone else, as we are all at different stages of the same game.”**

I realized that my achievements are amazing, given what I have managed to achieve through hard work. I realized despite other people being better than me, I still worked on myself and got to where I am through blood, sweat and tears. I deserve to be proud of my success. 

I realized that it is okay to sit down and have a cup of coffee while gently reminding myself that I have done a great job today filing paperwork. That if I have a deadline and am moving in 2 days, it is okay to share my concern to others and express how difficult the situation is. That it is okay for me to say my day was hard after writing a paper while my dad performed a surgery and ran through 3 experiments.

80,"I'm tired of being alone. Every time I've made a freind, it doesn't last long. I can count the number of freinds I've had in the last 5 years on one hand.
I'm tired of always being the first to start a conversation. If I don't start a conversation, no one will speak to me. Most of my ""freindships"" have been freindships of convenience.we work in the same place and only talk during work. Even now, since I've started my job in march, I've only gotten comfortable with a few people enough to talk to them, though most of them have moved to other areas (working in a large factory) and now I don't talk to them. 
I have made a freind through the internet, I've been talking to her since early March and we've met up a few times but even than I have to initiate the conversation with her.
I'm tired of being the therapist. Everyone I've gotten close to has always ranted to me without asking how i am, even my mom. Shell rant about whatever but when I try to talk about my problems she tells me to get over it, says I'm always bitching and at least I didn't have to deal with (insert her problem here). The only person who seems ok with me opening up is my grandmother, and my freind (though she's bad about asking how I am and I worry I'll push her away if I talk about some things). I haven't seen my grandma much during the pandemic, I've mostly only gone to work. 
I'm tired of feeling trapped in a cycle of work and sleep. It feels like all I've been doing and it's draining me. I feel like the company doesn't care at all about us, and it's clear they don't. 
I'm just tired.",24Aug2020,1

I'm just so sick of feeling worthless.  I'm sick of feeling like I don't really matter.  Tired of feeling like I'm being ignored.  Tired of feeling like I'm in the way.  My mental exhaustion has only gotten worse over time.  I cry often out of nowhere.  I just want to feel ""free"" to be unapologetically myself without feeling like the odd ball.  Made fun of because of my eclectic choices in music, art, film, etc.  I'm tired of feeling alone.  I'm tired of ALWAYS showing up for people but them NEVER showing up for me when I really need it.  I'm tired of being told to suck it up or get over it when I attempt to express how I feel.  For the first time in a long time, I feel like giving up.

84,"So to put it very briefly, for the past 6 months I’ve been growing. Physically and emotionally. I’ve been working out for longer than I can remember, I’ve been emotionally open to other people more than I have ever been. I’ve struggled with anxiety my whole life and this is the longest I’ve gone feeling “normal”.  Here’s the issue. So I ran into a hiccup in my workout routine and it caused me to not workout for a week, then it made me feel like a failure and I started missing work, then I began to stay in my house all day and never leave. One little thing made me completely turn in on myself and destroy my confidence. I guess my question is, how do I bounce back from this? It kind of bothers me how this is all it took to completely ruin me? I feel like I have this all or nothing mind set, I’ve been depressed the past four weeks about my failure and now I can’t even begin to try and rectify my mistakes because I can’t face the damage I’ve done to myself. If that makes sense. It just sucks because the side effects of me hating myself are amplified at work, I don’t want to talk to anyone, I feel unmotivated and I feel generally worthless as a human.  And it just keeps magnifying with every experience I have. And my work kind of requires me to be motivational and authoritative which is opposite to how I currently feel. Has anyone had a similar experience? How do I turn this around?",24Aug2020,1

I know what’s going on but I either don’t care or I have really mentally comprehend it. Like, you know that if you press the power button on a computer it will turn on, but you don’t understand the mechanics that lead to the computer actually turning on. It happens when I’m sad, anger, in a social situation where I wouldn’t like to be (like I talk to someone who I don’t really enjoy or I’m not in the mood to talk at all).

88,"I was born perfect. I have a perfect little engineer brain with no problems or disorders to speak of. It’s a miracle of statistics, but it happened. 

My dads brain is fucked up. Emotional trauma, bipolar depression, anxiety, the whole thing. Sprinkle in some ptsd and a few bonus disorders (like dyslexia) and you’ve got yourself a messed up fruit-salad of a brain. My mom is fine. By some crazy luck, I got exactly 1 of my dads problems, the dyslexia, and nothing else. I turned out to be perfect. 

Everything I didn’t inherit had to go somewhere, though. And all of it fell on my sister. *All of it.* Depression, anxiety, autism, even some shit that came up on its own like ADHD. Not only that, but now her lungs are fucked up and she’s seconds from hyperventilating 24/7. Every minute that goes by, she (along with her anxiety-filled brain) is acutely aware of every painful breath that goes through her. Can you imagine how horrible that is? How mind-shattering that must feel? I sure-as-shit can’t, because I was born perfect. I didn’t get any of it. I got lucky. 

My girlfriend’s parents are both fucked up, so it’s only natural that she ended up with some mental problems. Constant anxiety and worry every day. A shitty childhood that means she’s ineligible for 90% of colleges, and has 0 means of getting a full time job. 0 means of getting the money she needs for the meds she takes that barely help her feel some kind of stability. Her brain tortures her, her family ignores her, her mother abuses her. Sometimes it feels like I’m her only source of stability, and I live a fucking thousand miles away from her!! Can you imagine how much stress that causes her? How thin of a wire she’s walking every day to avoid breaking down or having an anxiety attack? *I can’t! Because I was born perfect!*

The world around me and the people in my life are so broken and fucked up in so many ways. So much pain, all the time, in what is apparently the ‘greatest country on earth’. So much shit is happening and I can do barely anything to stop it. I can’t make enough to move my girlfriend over, I’m not smart enough to figure out what’s wrong with my sister’s lungs, I’m not perceptive enough to tell when my dad is happy and when he’s just pretending, I’m not close enough to hold my girlfriend when she has a nervous breakdown...

And I was born perfect. Like some sick joke. 

And the worst part is that I’m not allowed to complain. 

I’m not allowed to mention my guilt to anyone. They’ll get more worried, they’ll say that they’re a burden on my life, or they’ll brush me off, they’ll say that I have it better, and they’ll all have a point! In fact, I’ll bet some of the people reading this are rolling their eyes and thinking I should just shut up, because I have it so much better than everyone else. So I’m not allowed to mention it. And I don’t. I just have to be perfect and watch the people in my life suffer.

Why couldn’t the universe have given me some of it? Given me my sister’s lungs, or my girlfriend’s unknown stomach problems, or my uncle’s carona, or my aunt’s diabetes, or my grandmother’s depression, or my grandfather’s skin cancer, or something. Anything. I’d gladly take it, just to lift some of the burden off of them, but I can’t. 

I can be there for them, I can tell them “Everything will be ok,” but it’s not enough. It’s ‘easy for me to say that’, after all, because I was born fucking perfect.",24Aug2020,1

I have to re read this post too in order to make it stick and see if i need to make corrections. Anyway. What is going on?

I once had a vasovagal syncope and threw up in class one day while reading about... the blue people of Tennessee. Not even a horrible illness. Wait no that was the time I almost passed out, the time that I did was reading about the brain eating amoeba. Man I hated that class.

97,"I (17m) been homeschooled for nearly my entire school years and had no friends except my neighbors who all moved away eventually leaving me by myself. We didn't have internet during my most of my pre-teen and teen years therefore I was basically a pretty lonely person and in my eyes failed to develop a personality and emotions. My only emotions were rage/sadness and some happyness but mainly loneliness during my teen years, in other words I was sad for being lonely and anything happening around me wouldn't affect me what so ever. My emotions were stone faced even tho I showed otherwise to hide my true self. Internet came back in my household last year. And I made few friends... And it was not till just a month ago after a depression stage that my emotions actually activated after accidentally hurting a close online friend by trying to hurt her friend who we didn't get along. This was the first time I cried in years... Now I feel like my emotional lock was set free and I feel a lot of different things now rather than barely not feeling anything.

99,"Hi, I'm a 19 year old male, relatively unattractive, and at the height at 5'6"". For about a year, I've had these reoccurring scenarios and thoughts that play in my head whenever I felt bored. 

Since I'm not very confident in my appearance, I tend to have this other persona of myself, in this instance I'm a very attractive man, at the height of 6'1"", and pretty well off financially. I would tend to have scenarios such as this persona doing activities I'd really enjoy, such as hiking or motocross racing, to social events like partying or going on dates. This persona also has great success with women, but the scenarios tend to be moreso having female friends rather than girlfriends. I would think of this persona in an optimistic way, hoping that I may end up hitting a growth spurt and become more attractive and successful.

This seems like just a normal thing, like a ""what if"" daydream most people have.

However, as of recent, these persona thoughts are no longer controlled and they constantly pop in my head whether I like it or not. Things are also going rough in my life rn, and for some reason I have developed two other personas.

One is an extension of the attractive persona, but in this persona, I'm a crook who commits many petty crimes and tends to get away with it. This persona involves me being involved in many criminal activities, from breaking windows and stealing, to beating up people for mobsters. This persona tends to have a very narcissistic view, where this persona believes that he has legal immunity simply due to his looks and criminal notoriety. This persona also seems to switch personalities, with being nice in order to gain something, then quickly switching to a being a malicious person.

The third persona is just a version of me right now, but as a criminal. However, the scenarios are very extreme, with 80% of them me being murdered or me murdering someone else. This persona seems to let out all of the pent up anger of my life.

These 3 personas pop up in my head uncontrollably and randomly, but I am aware what scenarios are occurring aren't real life, but a full blown story is created in each scenario, where I can't stop thinking about it. I also still have control of myself, so it's not like I'm physically paralyzed until the scenarios end.

Sorry if this is a long post, it's just a really hard thing to explain and I'm not even sure where to begin with what this is even related to. I do know this is a mental health issue however, since most of this is associated with the deterioration of my mental health.

One of the few things that I used to do to escape the sadness was my university work but the year had to end early and the new year doesn't start for another month which just means that I've had nothing going on in my life.

I (22F) have not gone to university during the whole year because even before the lock down, my school was taken by some protesters. When the protest ended in May, we started taking classes online. It's been hard for me, but my parents really don't care.  They don't ask about it. They're never home. When they see me doing homework in front of the computer they say I'm ""studying"" in a sarcastic tone. My dad took away all my privileges. He doesn't give me an allowance anymore. He treats me like a useless annoying thing he has to put up with and I have really internalized it. I feel like I have no purpose and no sense of direction, even though I'm still in college.

121,"-non english-speaker here- 
backstory: A good friend of mine (21 yo, female) has been depressed for a long time. I don't know about other diagnosed illnesses but she is seeing a therapist for a year now. 
Everytime we meet up, she complains about nausea and feeling like throwing up. She even went to different doctors because she feels sick for 5 years now but no one ever found something, so we think that the nausea is caused by her mental state. Even at night she has struggles sleeping because she feels sick or she wakes up because of nausea. 

On time during vacation, I stayed up all night writing an assignemt while she was sleeping next door. During her sleep she started screaming, whining, swearing and it sounded like she is getting chased or threatened by someone. It was really horrible to witness for me because it sounded like in a horror movie. It went on for some hours. 
She told me that her parents also witnessed this behavior but she the next morning she can never remember anything. 

Interestingly, her 'extreme' whining reduces when someone is sleeping in the same room as her. We tried sleeping in one room but still she moves sooo much, gets up multiple times, sometimes she cusses during sleep saying 'shit shit shit shit' and it sounds like she is in danger or some extreme situation. 

Yesterday, we had a sleepover at her place and she wasn't whining that much but still she talked during sleep: We slept on two mattresses laying next to each other on the floor. Because she began rolling onto my mattress, I stood up and moved it away from her. As I did so, suddenly her hand started shivering and she made loud shivering noises with her mouth, followed by saying 'fuck' multiple times. It ended after a few seconds. The next moring, she can't remember. 

Words can't explain how her whining sounds during sleep, I have never heard something more terrifying and scary. I can really sense her emotional distress during these phases and that she is really suffering from trauma or pain. She makes sounds that I would never hear during daytime. 

Does anyone know more about this behavior? Is she just talking while she dreams and is therefore harmelss?",24Aug2020,1
123,"I’m 15 years old and I don’t have a perfect family life. My dad is definitely a narcissist and he tends to scream very loudly, and it depends on his moods but generally when me or my siblings make mistakes he starts shouting.

I don’t have a good relationship with him, and when we have disagreements I tend to hold back points I want to make when I see that he’s getting annoyed at me for “talking back”

Another thing is that I’m constantly told I’m an ungrateful kid. Because I’m not abused physically, I have food and electricity and a phone provided, does that mean everything is perfect and fine? I don’t even know anymore. 

I’m told that I’m ungrateful for hating my private catholic school (I’m a gay atheist if that makes it clear why I hate that school).


That’s my childhood in a nutshell. My question is  is any of this something that’ll fuck me up? Because when I said that I hated saying “i love you”, I was told by a multitude of people that I should get therapy.

127,"I have two irl friends who I both really love and hang out with often. It’s clear that they’re both closer with each other than with me and I’m okay with that as long as we all hang out and I’m not a third wheel. We all decided to play some video game’s on PS4 tonight and chill in a party chat and the entire time they were ignoring me and whenever I tried to talk they talked over me. I just decided not to talk for the remaining hour or so of playing together and it’s like they didn’t even notice I was gone. I felt so invisible and pathetic. I care about them both so much despite neither of them giving a shit about me. I feel like I can’t even bring up my feelings to them otherwise it will “kill the vibe” and they’ll only talk to me because I brought it up, not because they actually like me or want to hear anything I have to say. I just don’t know what I’m doing wrong for them to dislike me so much because I truly love them both so much and would never let them feel like this. I know I probably need better friends but I can’t get any better than this. I feel truly pathetic.",24Aug2020,1
128,"I've been thinking about this for some good amount of time lately. I am a 27 years old Licensed Architect in the Philippines. I am in the profession for about 7 years as I have been a working student to support my overly expensive degree; and been licensed for 3 years. In my 5 years experience being a graduate and a professional, I have been jumping from one company to another due to my severe anxiety disorder and depression. As you can see, this profession is a time-consuming and a demanding one specifically to our mental health. I am pretty much good in my profession and can climb up from clerical to supervisor position in just one year. Until 2015 came and my lowest took place when my anxiety disorder and depression paid a visit for the first time in my life. I am working in a prestigious Architectural Design Firm during that time and since my first mental breakdown, I haven't been able to go to work. I became AWOL. Just the thought of going back to that firm makes me shake uncontrollably. I am so terrified of my booss there, so terrified of talking to our clients, so terrified of showing and speaking up in a meeting. But I still do so, and it creates a lot of stress in my part. I left my supervisor job there.

I took a 6-month break from Architecture to focus on my mental health and take some time to heal. But never get a chance to visit a doctor to consult my concern because I have no money left in my bank accounts and been depending on my parents during that time. Somewhat, the break helps. But I still need to earn some money. Finally I found a new job at a Chinese Construction firm. I am performing very well and immediately promoted to being the head of our Architecture Department. There came a time that I became the representative of the company to the prospective Chinese clients who desire to have a very well planned and designed project. And seeing them terrifies me, not understanding them doubles my dread. But then again, my depression and anxiety disorder linger with the sudden great amount of work. The firm needs fixing specifically in our department which is the prime source of income. Heavy load works and disagreement with my bosses in terms of paying me and my colleagues our salary on time have became a setback. I resigned from the job because I can no longer deal with the pressure.

Right now, I am freelance architect based in our city. Pay has been good. But not consistent. I have ample amount of time to interact with my family. I can work on my own terms. But I am not happy or satisfied or fulfilled. I am receiving works from our City Hall as a Local Architect. As day goes by, I am simply losing my motivation to do some CADworks, and I am finding it hard to deal with clients well. I find it hard to communicate myself and my needs. I have always been an introvert and loves keeping my solitude. Architecture requires a lot of social interactions, communication and networks. I am lacking it. Just the thought of asking my clients a payment for my job terrifies me. And when my clients are calling me, it makes me escalate the situation that I have done something wrong with my work eventhough it rarely is. I am really good with the designing and planning part, but the social interactions are what I dread about.

Since my first mental breakdown, I am having a hard time concentrating, focusing and remembering things. Which makes it hard for me to become an efficient Architect.

By the way, I am a female. If that contributes?

On the other hand, I love cleaning, farming, yoga, playing online games, reading books, and exploring alone. I am so interested in construction works, although I am yet to establish my skills there. I've found that seating in front of my computer 8+ hours a day is what makes my mental disorder severe. I have to move my body constantly or else I will encounter another mental breakdown.

My husband-to-be is not helping either as he is my complete opposite. He loves Architecture and meeting new people. He still don't understand my mental illness that is why we are planning to seek a psychiatrist together. But the pandemic makes it hard for us to find and book one. Hoping the specialist could atleast help me explain to him my struggles.

Should I quit being an Architect or should I just take a break? I know I have to deal with my mental disorder first, but how to do it while trying to earn for a living?",24Aug2020,1

130,"**IK THIS IS LONG BUT PLEASE BEAR WITH ME🙏**

Im an 18 year old girl. I do not have any suicidal thoughts, I don't hurt myself either but I feel very lost and not well mentally. I don't know what's wrong with me, I have more than I need in life and loving parents and friends and I am grateful for that but no matter how much I have and how much I keep on gaining (whether materialistic or not), I feel empty and as though I have absolutely nothing. I was a happy healthy kid until I moved to Sweden 6 years ago when I was 12 going on 13. I use to live in the Middle East but my family is open and international so most of my friends there were still international. Anyways, I think I experienced culture shock in Sweden, fell into a depression, lost 20+kg (had anorexia and I got it treated and been fully recovered for 2-3 years now). Also, Ive done horrible things, always went to extremes (but i think thats my personality). Here is a list of things I did:

-At 13, i downloaded a dating app and started talking to a 30 year old guy there and told him I wanted to have sex but have no experience. We ended up meeting up, he did noy force me to anything, was very nice I literally could have said I changed my mind and went home but yes I do realize he is a pedophile now. Anyways, that happened. And it was all my decision.

-At 16, I started texting guys online who want to buy sex. Cuz it was quick easy money and I could buy all the meaningless things I want (my family is upper middle class so as you see, my decisions are very irrational). I ended up selling sex 4 times between 16 and 17 years old me so it wasnt a regular thing. None of these times was I abused or anything, they were all nice and between ages 22-30.

-At 17, I met a guy online that I wanted to sell sex to. He was 28. I went to his place, we ended up talking for hours, he was very nice and wise. We then tried having sex but it didnt work cuz i was too stiff and shy. I insisted tho on meeting him again but no money involved cuz i kinda liked his company. Met him again 6 more times just for a chat and some light foreplay but then I stopped meeting him 2 months ago and told him it was not right for us to do this.

-I use to steal money from my parents because I was too afraid to ask them for money. I stopped doing that later tho cuz they caught me. Thats when i started the sex thing (cuz it paid A LOT). Then i got a waitress side job (i still have it now).

-I dont smoke (only when drunk so once a week for the past 5 months). I take drugs but only occasionally. I have done ecstast 3 times (so good!). LSD 3 times (also very good!) and weed once. I go to bars once a week with my friends, we get drunk, some guys approach us, meaningless sex, then back to normal life the next day.

-I never tried killing myself (except when i had anorexia). And I dont want to every kill myself. I want tp stay forever young (not possible) but as contradictory as that sounds, I love life and there are so many things I want to do.

-Ive never had a boyfriend but I regularly go on dates with guys I meet through apps. Its always tho like one date then sex then we don't meet again. And it makes me feel empty afterwards so i need to stop dating for a while I think.

-Ive been betrayed by friends in the past. Now not anymore. Its rather me who betray them. Like as soon as I feel im getting closer to someone, I take distance and that might seem rude but whatever.

-I have feelings but I cant rly show them. Ppl have told me im cold. I do show my feelings tho to my very close friends or to my parents. I feel tho that I have cried so much in my life that i currently cant get myself to cry anymore.

-I live with both my parents and I havent talked to my dad in 5 years now even tho we live together. He has done nothing wrong to me and keeps treating me with love and I dont deserve that. Idk why I dont talk to him, it started when i had anorexia. I just dont like his personality and way of being (interrupts people, talks in a very agressive way, etc.). I do see myself in him sometimes and I hate it.

-With all that love I receive from peoppe in my life, I still dont feel like I have the love I WANT. I think I want a guy to love me romantically and not only use me for sex.

-Even if that might not be true, I think that whatever guy that approaches me only wants me for sex. Also, i am very dirty minded idk why and i hate it. I want a guy to love me for me.

-I have many hobbies (art) and Ive been called talented so its not like I do nothing with my life. I also always was amongst the best students in class.

-ive probably done more horrible things but i currently cant think of anything.

Anyways, my day to day life is full of action. I work, i go out with friends often, regularly meet new people and I have my hobbies. Yet I just feel EMPTY and like there is smthg wrong with me. I dont think im normal. All my friends call me weird but that they love it. Anyways that is not the point. Just please tell me what is wrong with me.

132,"TW//: child sexual abuse 






When I was maybe 8 or 9 I was sexually abused for maybe 6 months - 1 year (my memory of the timing is very foggy, it could have been longer/shorter and older/younger)
My brother who is 7 years older used to invite me into his room at night and play ‘doctors’. I remember he used to make me suck him and play with him and he used to play with me but I can’t remember any actual penetration. My other brother of a similar age also assaulted me twice with attempted penetration but wasn’t an ongoing thing.
I know it’s obviously very wrong, it went unreported but I don’t think I even hold it against them. Is it normal for me to think I’m not affected by this? I don’t feel ‘traumatised’ or like a victim or anything along those lines. 
Today I am severely depressed, anxious, lazy and over weight. I have suicidal thoughts quite often, I don’t have a job and haven’t for the past 4 years, all I do is sit at home and eat and watch tv or play on my phone. I have friends and I love them but I have literally never connected with anyone so much that I am 100% comfortable with them. I haven’t been to a therapist or anything of the sort because of my anxiety so I guess that’s why I’m here on reddit? Idk 
I have pretty bad mental health issues (clearly lol) but I kind of don’t think it’s my experiences to blame. Like when I’m really down I don’t think about my abuse and dwell on it, it’s more to do with my current situation and future etc 
Could my issues now be unknowingly related to my childhood experiences or am I just messed up in the head and this is my natural course.

I also have some anxiety
I worry way more than I should most of the time (during a particular bad time during my childhood I started getting a few white hairs)

134,"You know, all I wanted was a normal life to live. Not to be judged to who I am and for the things I've done. All I want is to have peace in my life, being able to go on freely without the worries of who am I upsetting today or how it's effecting them.
Even with the stories that I've done, it still seems that people can still not respect me. My own family, and even myself can't even give the littlest of respect. 
When I look into the mirror, I don't see myself or the good I've done. All I see is a lost cause, nothing but failure. Telling myself, how the fuck are you going to ruin shit today. What the fuck are you going to do today that'll make a better tomorrow. Even at the point, I have nothing to say, but just to shut down. Believing to be the truth. Just the same way I stupidly believe every words that comes from people and families mouths. 
The words that echos in my head every night. Making it impossible to sleep.  Useless, stupid, untrainable, lost cause, and non loveable. Even though they are words, I rather have my teeth pulled out than to put up with the mental pain. A bruise can come and go. Cause you can understand the fact of how it got there. 
But not to understand why people treat me the way they do, insulting me making me feel less human. Is fucked up, and when you hear it enough. It must be true to what they are saying. It's not like they all have a meeting and agree on how to mentally fuck me up. 

When people say they feel alone, I'm not sure what their version of being alone is. But when I say I feel alone. I still want to hang myself even though  I'm surrounded by people. Even when I'm smiling and laughing I still want to shoot myself. Even when everything seems to be getting better, I still want throw myself into traffic. Constantly in my own thoughts, ignoring things. Allowing myself to self deteriorate. Smoking, drugs, liquor, staying up late. Turning myself into a zombie to loose focus of my life.

I have ran into a problem, I self harmed for the first time in 5 years and can’t stop. My family saw the other day and threatened to send me to the hospital again.

While this option might seem helpful on the surface because I am very suicidal, it didn’t help the last time. I also would more than likely fail my classes and lose my job if I went into the hospital. 

I just feel like I have no where to turn. I already see a therapist and a psychiatrist, but every time I mention how badly I’m doing everyone threatens the hospital. It’s like everyone thinks I’m too far gone and that is the only option.

I always feel like people have a negative view on me, even people that I don't know. Like it's always in the bad of my head, people look at you because you are ugly, when they are nice to you they just pity you, shit like that.

I have no problem looking somebody in the eyes, atleast on a good day. Some days I will feel especially ugly and just dont want people talking or looking at me at all. Not looking somebody in the eyes feels way more awkward than not tho.

I have no problem with physical contact also, it will be a bit of a shock (because I never really got any physical affection as a kid ever), like if a girl puts her hand on my shoulder for a second, it's like, ""whoa"" but in a good way, it feels good. 

I just feel so fucking alone tho, like I am the spectator of everyone else's lives, seeing them be happy and confident etc, while I'm locked in a cage behind a 360° one way mirror, hating it.

I'm not really social at all, I don't want people feeling obligated to spend their time with me, plus if I had friends, it would always be in the back of my mind that they secretly dislike me. 

Im a really low energy person, I sound like I just woke up 24/7, I feel like I just woke up 24/7 also lol, I don't speak loudly, I don't tell ever (when I tell my throat gets sore), have low energy movement

Loud noises don't bother me, if I hear a loud noise, Ill be like, ""huh?"" and pause to identify where it came from, and then carry on

I don't feel like I fit in at all

I never had a girlfriend, and I want so badly to just cuddle with somebody that I love, like so fucking badly

I feel like I belong in my dreams more than reality

I don't get comfort from touching a certain material or texture, I know some autistic people do

I want to be happy. Every once in a while, I will remember this feeling of being happy as a kid, it's like a glimpse and then it's gone, I'm not actually feeling the feeling, it's locked behind indestructible glass, only for me to view it, not experience it

I have no problems identifying emotions, although I do have trouble feeling emotions nowadays, it feels like the forecast is locked on being cloudy with light showers, with thunderstorms every once in a while.

I am socially awkward I would say, I don't really talk much, I have no trouble holding a conversation tho, infact I've noticed I've mostly been the one to start a conversation, but I still don't feel like everyone else, I feel below everyone else, pretty much on every aspect

143,"Okay, if I went into every single detail of what has happened to me over this past week we’d be here all day - so let’s just say that it has been ROUGH. I got a tummy bug that sent my health anxiety into overload, to the extent where something would trigger me and I would just sit and cry from being that overwhelmed. Usually when something makes me incredibly anxious I sort of freeze and don’t have the capacity to cry but this scared me so much that I would just flat out cry, and this is what I spent most of my days doing. 

I just had to wait for the tummy bug to pass because I could not live with the tummy bug and not experience anxiety. Finally, I’m feeling a LOT better and as I began to recover from this tummy bug my anxiety began to alleviate. I was at a point where I felt really existentially  confused. The meaning of life (for whatever reason) always crops up when I have periods of anxiety. I question the meaning or the value in everything and look at my future with a lack of excitement and just like it’s something I’m gonna *have* to experience whether I like it or not. Everything I look at is tinged with sort of meaninglessness - this emotion just intensifies my anxiety and makes me feel mildly to moderately depressed. As I find ways to work with my anxiety and get rid of it, this sort of unpleasant feeling becomes a lot less prevalent and tends to only crop up rarely.  

In short, I felt pretty hopeless and completely physically overwhelmed. I’m feeling so much better and I have a lot more appreciation for everything around me now and I’m back to my joyful self.

149,"Vent/Question

On May 20th I started my weight loss journey. I weighed a whopping 270, since then I’ve trimmed it down to 225 and not stopping. But what caused me to start losing weight was the fear of getting diabetes. I’m 18 and even at my highest I wasn’t even prediabetic, but for some reason if I’m not working out I feel like I’m just increasing my risk. I took a 3 day period off from working out, usually my routine is take a mile walk (I’ve halted that since it’s been super hot recently) and play beat saber until my watch tells me my 450 calories are burned which is like 45 minutes and if it’s a good week with no rest days I can total up to around 10-14 hours of working out. I barely eat but in the sense of I eat a decent sized meal in the day and later I’ll have a protein shake as a substitute, 

But even with this life change. I can’t help but feel like I’m huge. That I’m disgusting that if I don’t stop working out I’ll get diabetes in a day, when that takes years of Eating wrong and not working out. 

But even though everyone says I look skinnier and I mean 45 pounds is a lot, the fact that I’m still classified as obese, I feel like I look like I’m fat Albert, will this go away?

151,"I never talk about my feelings, so might as well do it to hundreds of thousands of people the first time. 

I've lost a lot of control over my life slowly during this quarantine. The first 2 months were not that bad. I was eating properly, exercising everyday, talking to my gf all the time (LDR). After that I let go of myself gradually. I started masturbating frequently again (a previously handled problem). Then I stopped exercising so much because no one's gonna see me anyways. Then I start to play video games again obsesively.

The reason i returned to playing games again was because it was the easiest thing to do . And this was where it got downhill extremely fast. I had dealt with anger issues since I was a child fueled by frustrating online games like counter strike. The reason I kept playing was every win felt like a high. But every loss filled me with so much anger.

Then valorant came and fuck me it was addicting, I was hooked, I played every day for almost 6 hours. And my relationship dwindled. 

Because of this I talked less and less to my gf and of course we broke up. The fucked up thing was I wasn't sad when it happened, I was expecting it, I imagined it multiple times.

The group of friends I play with left and moved on to other games and now I realise how fucked I am. This whole time my reward system came from porn, games, and junk food. All the time I spent building my relationship is now gone and I'm left fatter, weaker, sadder, and lonelier than I've ever felt.

152,"Hey there! It’s the first time I write something on reddit so I hope it’s the right place, otherwise just tell me which subreddit applies to my struggles.
I’m a master student in Florence, Italy and so far I did quite well. But because of this whole pandemic situation I needed to postpone on writing my master thesis and I just started now with the research. I could have done something during the lockdown, like reading more scientific articles. But I didn’t. I feel burned out, I feel alone. Everything I own, everything I pay, is thanks to my willpower to survive in a academic world, albeit I come from a lower middle class family with no academic background. I worked hard my whole life, but I struggle to keep that up. It’s august, and I need to find a new place by September which I can afford. My parents can’t help me with anything, not since I’m 18, but I never questioned it. Im always grateful for their love and that they believe in me. But I can’t expect any financial security from them. I need to start working before my scholarship ends. And I know I’ll need to write my master thesis while I’m already working. It will be a lot and I’m quite anxious- not of the workload but of my inability to discipline myself and to do everything on time. Oftentimes I feel like a fraud, like I don’t deserve the thinks I worked for. I feel dumb too, especially when talking to students with an academic background. But the reason why I write here, is because I want to know if there’s somebody whose been trough a similar situation. Because all my Italian friends have a safe net here, their families. My German friends (I grew up in Germany, immigrated from Eastern Europe) stayed close to their families, they don’t know what migration means. They don’t know my struggle even if they tell me how proud they are, and that I’m courageous etc. All I can do is give them a tired smile. I don’t feel courageous, I feel lost at this point. I know Italy very well, also the daily life. I see it as my home, I choose it willingly, knowing that the dolce vita is oftentimes a thing of the movies (but sometimes it’s real, too). But I have nobody to talk about this issue, because I don’t know anybody my age who ever took some real risk in their lives. 

Wow this is quite long, I really hope to not have caused a pity party. I just want to know if there’s somebody who can tell me from an authentic place: you’ll be alright. Thank you. ♥️",24Aug2020,1

Most nights I sleep okay, it isn't very good deep sleep but I do fall asleep quickly, and dont lay awake with my eyes wide open until tonight. There wasnt anything different, no coffee, drugs, etc. I did the same things I normally do, the biggest difference today was eating fritos. However, when I was trying to go to sleep, I put my phone down and closed my eyes, but they wouldn't stay shut. Obviously I could force them to, but my brain was just racing and my body wasnt tired. I played on my phone for a while then tried to go back to sleep, and repeated that all night, but its 530 am now and I just tried again to no avail.

Three years ago, I shifted to working alone @home. I absolutely loved it. I had few childhood irl friends. But I kept cutting the number off, I very much disliked the vainity and superficiality involved with most friendships. I dont know what I had to do. Everyone faded away. 

Given a nerd I am, no one would resonate with me as I like to talk about science, physics, philosophy, humanity, space , technology, anime, music etc. Not a single soul I could watch anything with, not a single soul to share my type of music. Not a soul to emotionally connect to around my age. Thus I settled completely on self-reliance and didn't do a thing other than work these &gt;=6 months. Latter, my circadian rhythm altered. I slept during the day and under the peace and elegence of night, lived my life alone.

I thought I got it but ...

I don't know what got fed into my mind. Here I am; questioning my reality. My significance of existence. Whether my body of flesh and blood has anything to do with 'reality' As if like there are clouds and I can't see the sky. Time now has no effect on me. Coupled with covid, always in my room, my computer screen seems to haunt me, and I can't get out of it. I always feel like as if the next day never comes. I'm afraid of myself, my vs me. I hope I win, but which one of us.

159,"Hi, I think this is my first time posting something on Reddit, but I felt the need to. I've been having some depression episodes during the last 4 months. I've attempted suicide 2 times and I was on a psychiatric hospital during a week. After that, I began to go to a psychiatrist and a psychologist to help me with the struggles I had before. During a period of time, I was in a good state. I took medication and I thought it worked, at least for me. After some weeks, the medication finished and for some weeks I felt amazing. But after that, everything returned, and worse than ever. I was getting some very intrusive thoughts, that with a bit of time I could overcome, but now is worse than ever. I don't know why but my mind made me think that everyone and everything around me isn't real. That everything is a product of my mind. I don't want to think that, but every time a person talks or moves, my mind suddenly comes with the idea that all of that is a fabrication made by my subconscious. That my family isn't my family, that my friends aren't my friends. That I'm all by myself in this world, that none of you reading this exist, that every feeling that you can have is non-existent. Is so painful to think that Your family isn't real or that your friends don't exist, that sometimes I don't really know what to do.

162,"Hello, my parents are not on good terms. My mom said the only reason she has not divorced my dad was because of me and my sis. My dad has been unemployed for 4-5 years and has basically been a leech all he does is buy groceries and some other household stuff, he doesn't even need to do chores as we have a maid. My mom works so that there is food on our table. My senile grandma also lives with us and she has to constantly get treatment. Money isn't really the big issue here since my mom has a job that pays well. My dad has always been the ""know it all"" and it is almost impossible to convince him otherwise so my mom is always on the losing end whenever they argue. All he has to do is raise his voice and he basically drowns out my mom's voice and she ends up getting up and leaving usually with tears in her eyes. I'm not saying that my dad is always right and my mom ain't perfect either. I tried advising my mom to do what I usually do which is to just suck it up and not bother whenever my dad says or does something that will spark into an argument because I have given up on him. I basically just act like a competent son whenever I'm in front of him. But then I realized that she could not do that because that is her husband, someone that she loves or loved idk anymore. I'm getting really fed up being caught up in the middle of this toxic relationship and I don't know just how much I can take anymore.

Was in a bad wreck 5 years ago and have aches and pains now. I workout daily and am in great health

About a year ago I started having out of body experiences and thought I was dying.  The room would go blurry and it was hard to walk. I’ll add I did get shingles on my foot in January and still get burning sensations when I’m having bad anxiety 

I’ve seen doctors and all tests were normal. I’m now speaking to a psychologist and haven’t done meds yet. 

Are these panic attacks? They come daily and out of nowhere. I can’t explain it

I’ve read books and it’s fascinating what’s going on. At this point I know my amygdala is worn out and constantly in fight or flight mode. For whatever reason every day it kicks it into high gear and I think I’m dying. My wife says I often wake up in the middle of the night like I can’t breathe and hyperventilate.

I’m trying as hard as I can to overcome this without meds. I’ve started meditating, yoga, stretching exercises and breathing exercises. I would say it’s helped 20%.

I am 25 M, I am not that talkative, I only hang around with my close friends. I don't bully people or troll them, I treat with respect to them, but people thought that you were weak and make fun of you. They don't respect privacy. since at the age of 16 I constantly being told that you are lazy, weak, girl, making fun of you for all the things. It would make your confidence low and after that you would tried to runaway. 

I have faced no positive acknoldgement over the years, people always think that they are higher than me, ( or it just my mind) . I am feeling absolutely low, it makes me to stay alone, even if i achieved something they wouldnt credit me, they would still make fun of each other. Even my relatives are doing that, there are lot of stupid people in my relative, who talk behind their back, but still every one trust them. i am being gentle and true, but i feel i am mistreated

for example-

I played poker yesterday with my relatives, i won and they told you played silently and won , nobody should trust you( they expect me to loose even before the start) what should i do, i get the cards right and i won it, i wouldnt said that if they would havewon the game.

I tried to be like them but i cant do that, my heart would nt allow that,

174,"I am reflecting a lot today. I am realizing I have never publicly shared my dad’s amazing life and sadly tragic ending. 

I have not been ready, but I finally feel I am strong enough to share, and it has taken me 7 years (and this is OK). His story needs to be heard because it may be able to help someone else. 

My dad was my best friend. Literally BEST friend. We talked every single day no matter where in the world I was. We both kept incredibly outdated blackberry phones JUST because the nature of my job in the military - we weren’t just able to pick up the phone and call. It could have been the extreme time difference or just exactly where I was at in the world - working on a different missions and operations.... but we found a way to stay connected and stay incredibly close. We both needed each other in a loving way that I had only known with him. 

He was the funniest guy on the planet! Incredible sense of humor and outrageously intelligent and insightful. 

He was the last person I “thought” needed any extra help or care because he WAS so strong. He had tackled anything thrown his way with ease and was the foundation of our large family. He took care of us all and made sure everyone ELSE around him was taken care of. 

His love for EVERY SINGLE PERSON around him eventually caused himself to let his own health and needs take a back seat. 

After the very difficult passing of his grandmother - something changed. Nothing incredibly noticeable but it was noticed. By every member in our family. We all realized he was struggling and maybe acting a bit out of character. We never wanted to make him feel bad for struggling so we ALL just tried to listen and just BE THERE for him.. allow him his moments to grieve... he just wasn’t doing it healthily. 

We were ALL worried.. and we “spoke up” a tiny bit...... just not loud enough. 

My family had never experienced something like this so how could we have known what was to come? No one is to blame.. least of all Bruce! 

He lost his battle in November 2013. The day before Thanksgiving. He had purchased all the food in preparation to make the best dinner the next day. He never made that dinner. 

I got the call from my younger sister, Chelsea, while I was driving to work on MacDill AFB. I was supposed to go on a badass TDY the next morning. I never went on that TDY. 

There were a lot of things he never got to do. There are countless things my family never did after that day. One important thing being... 

healthy coping and asking for help. 

I rushed to my home in Biloxi, MS to do my best to take care of my little sisters and my mom - like my dad would if he could. I made it my life’s goal to try my damndest to be there for my family how he would have been... of course, he left too big of shoes to fill.. 

When I first got to see him.. I was surprised. I was in shock. I could NOT process what was in front of my face. I went through every emotion in the span of 2 minutes including burning anger. I was EXHAUSTED from the mental Chaos I was experiencing. 

I fell to my knees next to him and decided to lay down.. I stared out of a door and laid down. I just could not get up. My poor mom kept crying and saying: Jessie, you HAVE To get up. 

I eventually physically allowed my body to be lifted and went through the motions I knew I had to. 

For years and years and years.. I always knew in my heart - I never really got up.. I left myself there. I was still on that funeral floor laying down - going through the motions of life I knew I had to. For so very long. 

It took me longer than I care to admit to finally seek therapy and DEAL with my father’s passing. 

BUT I WENT... 

It doesn’t matter that it was 6 years later... it doesn’t matter if it were a decade later.. what mattered is that I realized.. I am still on that floor, and I need help! 

I share this only to honor his incredible memory and accomplishments.. I can’t even really do that because I would be typing for the next year just to fairly capture his GREATNESS. 

But I also share to hopefully reach someone that feels like they are stuck somewhere and have been for a while. Maybe someone doesn’t even realize they need help - just like I didn’t! 

I have come light years from where I was! I can finally look at his pictures. I can finally think of the hilarious stories and LAUGH! And I know that’s that he’s always wanted. 

Please reach out to me personally if I can help you in anyway get to where you need to be. I will do anything I can from wherever I am.

Look at the rock, he's a physically fit person yet he's the nicest person out there, and that's because he lets out his frustration and anger on the weights.

My therapist told me it's a great place to vent, and you know what, she's right.

The more muscle you have, the more you're in control of your emotions.  That's at least what I found out.

Plus there are benefits to gaining muscle.  You're more confident, you exert authority, and you're more motivated and emotionally intelligent.

180,"Basically the title. I didn't really have issues with depression until I was about 19 (28 now). Talk therapy helped a bit,  but I didn't really see a drastic AND consistent change until started regularly taking a multivitamin again. Up until about 18 or 19, I almost always took one because my dad made my brother and I breakfast every morning throughout school, and a multi was always included. 

It wasn't until a health coach (something my budget insurance required) suggested that it might be something in my gut and taking a multi to combat my garbage eating habits could help. I was about 24 now. Sure enough, I actually started to feel more up and normal in just a day or two. 

Fast forward several years to this past week. I have a 10 month old, a lovely fiancé, a nice cozy house, and a steady job. Lockdown and working from home has definitely thrown my routine, and I have fallen out of taking the multivitamin. My fiancé and I got into a pretty heated yet trivial argument (that was my fault), and it just had me spiraling for the past 4 days. Nothing I tried to do snapped me out of it; playing guitar, working hard in the yard,  hanging with my son. I remembered about the vitamin, took one, and was entirely embarrassed about how every bad feeling seemed to wash away in the next half hour. 

I'm not saying that this is curing it by any means, but if my baseline mood was on a scale of 10, with 0 being the lowest, it moved me from like a 2 to a 7.

I feel like it is partially my fault because I was feeling good and wanted to leave, but that was just my brain switching from low to high. My new psychiatrist actually gave me the time and is weaning next off, the side effects and now the withdrawal symptoms have really messed up my ability to basically do anything.

I'm NEET, very depressed, lots of anxiety, diagnosed ASD, strongly suspected ADHD i'm trying to get diagnosed, i'm trans (early DIY) so i have body issues but also some apart from being trans too i think. I have very low self esteem, it's hard thinking anything good about myself. When people compliment me it just doesn't register as anything but a mistake or a 'wrong opinion' lol. I think this is what imposter syndrome is isn't it? I don't get it with just that, I have regular existential crisis where I question my entire world view, identity, place, purpose, where everything I thought feels suddenly fake, but any replacement my mind tries to thrust on me feels questionable enough still that it doesn't take or doesn't stick.

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;personal info you can probably skip&gt;

I have a place to live with my parents and they don't remind me i should be getting a job every day or anything thankfully but they still say things sometimes that are hurtful or tiring even when not directed at me, it feels like everyone in the house is from a different planet a lot, and I have a lot of negative associations with them from childhood that makes those small things feel worse. We don't have much in common to talk about. 

i'm semi-hikikimori, I used to be worse, I still have long depressive periods of not wanting to go outside, wanting to shut myself off entirely from the world (going through one right now, it's been weeks) but I thankfully have a very close friend who I usually see every week, who helped me get a bit more comfortable doing basic things like shopping, even if he doesn't realise it. I can't begin to describe the love I feel for him. I feel like i'm straining our relationship a lot lately though. He has his own issues and hasn't been able to be as supportive lately which is worrying me for a few reasons i shouldnt really get distracted with in this post too much so i'll just say I don't think he'd ever abandon me or feel the need to stop seeing me (lol typing this made me feel uncertain about that actually) because as weird as it feels to say I think I do and have helped him too, he's said so at least, I just don't want to keep being how I am especially with the stress it can cause him.

&lt;personal info you can probably skip/&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

So I think a strong, key step to building my self esteem and generally better mental attitude is having a somewhat creative and productive outlet, but my problem is i've had plenty of interests i've tried to do this with a lot (programming, music production, drawing, history, political theory, philosophy, probably others im forgetting) and at some point I'm either overwhelmed with the feeling that i'll never get anywhere with what i'm doing, that i'm not learning anything, or that I don't know where to go from where i am, i'm lost, stuck.

That sends me in to a huge depressive spiral where i give up and can't do anything but sit around hating myself. idk why i'm like this, i hate it (woops, there i go again lol). And that's happened so much now even bringing up a pdf or youtube video on programming makes me feel sick, sadness and despair slowly setting in, i'm even less able to focus than i usually am. it just skips the middleman of trying hard at something for a month to feeling bad and hopeless about myself.

so is there anything i can do about this that could be learned from reddit? or am i seriously fucked? mental health care in the UK is pretty terrible.

(end rant: I think this post is a lot worse than the one reddit ate and i hate it, i could feel myself losing focus and trailing off which is why put those tags there in the end ugh)",24Aug2020,1
188,"My best friend in the world is amazing. I've never met someone I've just been able to click with so well, and I wouldn't hesitate to do anything for her. If she needed something, all she has to do is say the word.

However, she suffers from depression and schizophrenia. It's worth mentioning that she's on the spectrum (not very high) because I think it affects how she handles things. She woke up the morning and came to my room (we share a dorm) and told me about one of her dissociative episodes last night, and she seemed really nonchalant about it, as if it were something she just needed to get off of her chest. 

I didn't exactly know what to say in that moment, and she often tells me about how she feels sad and cries frequently, but all I can do is tell her that ""I'm here for you no matter what"" and I'll rub her back or play with her hair sometimes. 

But I want to know what else I can say to try and genuinely help her. She has gone through several traumatic moments in life and thinks about them several times a day. It's where everything can be going right, but her day will be ruined or she'll be sad because she thinks about it.

I'm not the best when it comes to mental health due to the fact that I come from a ""we don't talk about feelings"" Asian family, or it's just rather stigmatized. I bounce back from events that have happened to me and I don't think about the past, and due to my background, I don't even talk about what happened. There's such a difference in how we both handle mental illness/health, and I want to know how I can better help her.",24Aug2020,1
190,"Hi.

I have what I call ""lapses"". (I don't know what they really are, but it's the best name I have) They have been happening to me semi-regularly for as long as I can remember. but lately, they've been getting more regular. And frankly... I'm scared.

They happen when I get excited, angry, or nervous. I don't exactly black out, but I lose like 90% of my awareness of what's going on around me.

I flap my arms, or move strangely during this time (and I don't realise I'm doing it until afterwards). I can look scared or angry. Usually I'm having, what I can only describe as a really vivid flashback? To something that has or hasn't happened. Sometimes it's like a crazy fantasy or what I would do in a certain farfetched situation, other times it's a vivid memory of an abusive relation I was in a few years ago. I'm like... almost fully in that moment, imagining what happened/what would happen. They are very emotionally draining? When I come too, I'm usually hyperventilating, super out of breath, very freaked out, and don't have that much memory of what was happening in real life, during the lapse. They can happen at random, triggered by whatever I might be daydreaming about, or often triggered by a TV show I'm watching, a random video. Something that's upset me or pissed me off.

It's extremely rare they happen around other people. But lately they have become more regular. I dread them happening at the wheel of my car, or in front of friends or co-workers. I'm writing this today, because it happened in front of my boss, when I was exhausted after a long shift after a camping trip. She definitely clocked it, and pulled a very like... ""wtf"" face. I drove home, really unnerved and embarrassed.

I'm writing this here, because I am way too scared to go to the doctors and from previous experience the NHS waiting list for mental health services is so long, the service may well not exist. and I really cannot afford regular private therapists (I'm a bartender and guitar repairman lol)

I should say, I'm 29. A cis-dude. I have no official diagnoses of anything really. I've seen a therapist before, but that was for depression and anxiety rather than whatever the fuck this is.

I'm not sure what other information I need to include, but feel free to message me.

Thank you a tonne for reading this &lt;3 Any advice or hint as to what this might be, is welcome.",24Aug2020,1
191,"Is there such a thing as the one? I doubt it. But, I feel like I know her. I've known her for many years and after so many years of helping her, being there for her and such, she said yes to me asking her out on a date. To celebrate her birthday, she invited me to her place to her BBQ with her family and best friends.   


For the past year, I have had less than 4 hour sleep a night. My sleep is ruined and it's messed with me. It's almost like everything wrong with me came into full effect that day. I did well to start with and at the end but in the middle of the day at her house, I was mentally dead. I blanked out at points due to tirdness and anxiety of trying to do well for her and set a good impression. When I returned back from the quite long drive, she said she was super bummed that I didn't talk that much and after a bit of texting she said something that was like a knife through the heart.  


&gt;You're like two different people.

I have no idea where we go from here, my final message to her at this moment was how much I was sorry I messed up, how I loved her (something she said to me the day before, even if drunk) and how although I want to know so much more about her, I really want her to know more about me.

&amp;#x200B;

That quote above has ringed in my head since yesterday and will for a while I think. I feel like a monster. Being told you're like two different people from the one you trusted the most... I plan to leave where I live for a bit to regroup before focusing on work, changing jobs like I was planning to do and trying my best to save up to invest in myself.  


You know what's funny? Sure, joking about mental health and such is fine between friends/partners/whatever and all but when that mental health comes up in real life, it's heartbreaking to see that person turn you away. I really do feel like a monster now, which I don't think I should be, but... I dunno.

192,"i’m generally a pretty happy person, always smiling, shit like that. however some mornings i’ll wake up super sad and will just want to cry all day for no reason in particular. it usually comes with irrational thoughts like “he/she hates me, you aren’t good enough for them, etc” but there’s no real cause as to why i think this way. there have been times in the past where i’ll just sob for hours on end for no reason and i can’t stop.

this also often occurs after an event, like hanging out with my friends. i’ll feel really happy in the moment but afterwards i’ll feel like i hit my peak and i’m never gonna be that happy again. these days tend to put me in a funk where i feel like everything i do is pointless and i’m constantly trying to one-up my good moments. 

i’ve felt like this for a while now but it’s definitely gotten worse over quarantine, probably bc i’m by myself most of the time so the fun moments i do have are amplified. i know that being sad for no reason is a key sign of depression but i’m usually pretty happy most of the time and i don’t want to self diagnose.",24Aug2020,1

I feel so bad for her, she didn’t have an easy life and I think she suffers from depression and anxiety.

It’s very scary, when he goes through an episode his anger is off the scale and builds like a fire with petrol adding to it every second. He refuses to take medicine prescribed by the doctor because it makes him feel like a zombie and makes him eat a lot of food.

Sometimes he overthinks and the psychosis episode occurs; it feels like someone has taken over his body and mind, controlling him. It’s really difficult for us because we don’t know how to help and literally anything stressful will trigger him. He doesn’t want to help himself and do exercise or eat healthy, I need advice desperetely

A few days ago I was in a heated argument with my husband, the reason wasn't important but as the argument went on I started remembering things about my mother and when my husband asked about her I broke down into hysterics.

It'll be 6 years since her passing come the end of this month, our relationship wasn't the best but I didn't realize how abusive and neglectful she was till now.

She was an abusive/neglectful alcoholic, I remember she would regularly leave us home alone or in the car for hours while she'd go grocery shopping, and while she did provide us with toys food clothes ect, looking back it was so she could keep us quiet and stay out of her way ,I have no memories of us doing anything together or even talking with her((except for her asking something of me or criticizing me))

Whenever there was a family event or time to show us off(I have a twin sister) she'd doll us up in matching outfits and suddenly started showing us off to all her peers, and then suddenly want us quiet and away from her once we were home, the more I started remembering it started dawning on me that she didn't really want either of us.

I got more hysterical as I started remembering more and more , and despite still being upset from the previous argument he left to get his mother who came and comforted me once he explained what happened and helped me calm down.

Last week one of his ""platonic friend"" contacted me out of nowhere. I have never gave her my number and how she was saying that because I called her out about their relationship in January caused her being abused by her ex that also abusive. She told me that she hope that ""I hope you found this well that your text in the past about my relationship with your ex created a trouble for my life"". I was shocked and I did't know how to react, because couple days before her texted, I have been having suicidal thought again because of my depression and my trauma. I had a plan how I want to kill myself.

After that text, I become more depressed. I feel that I'm going down hill so fast and I don't even know how to function. I don't have energy to even brush my teeth in the morning. I don't have energy to go anywhere. I don't have energy to even go to the bathroom and get out of my bed. I have to force myself to do my routine.

I feel that depression and how my ex tried to make feel more terrible is definitely working. I wonder if this is one of his way so I can finally kill myself so he doesn't have to divide our martial asset. Clearly is working. And if i died, he would still get a lot of money from my life insurance, since I haven't changed any of that. Why this guy is so cruel to me? Why he wants to destroyed me to the ground?

The worst part is I know what I need to do. I should probably exercise, or find friends. BUT I DON’T. I exercise for a few days, barely feel any better (I’m overweight) and stop after a few days. I have one friend from HS who I talk to once a week at most. 

I feel so down. I don’t know if I had a clear message but I really am falling into a maladaptive rut and I’m so irritable and indifferent and I don’t know what to do anymore.",24Aug2020,1
224,"I recently changed the dosage of my SNRI (only to the actual recommended starting dose, as my doctor had me on half of that to transition from my last medicine), and wound up missing 3 days of work due to intense headaches and dizziness that wouldn’t go away.

225,"I recently started taking medications for my depression. It’s been a long journey. I’m 17 now and the first time I remember feeling depressed was when I was about 11. I’ve been trying to get help for years and it took this long for anyone to actually listen. I’ve been on medication for about a month now and I’ve been feeling a lot lighter. But even though I’m feeling better in some aspects, I’m still heavily struggling in other areas. I’ll give you a quick run down with what I’m dealing with outside of depression. One issue I’m having is that I’ve been feeling quite a bit of anxiety. So many things make me feel anxious; sending emails, filling out paperwork, thinking about the future, talking to certain people and answering texts have all been giving me a knot in the pit of my stomach lately. Those are just a couple examples off of the top of my head. For reference things like that have been a struggle for me for some time now, but they’ve been a lot more prominent as of late. When I feel anxious like that it’s hard for me to do anything other than constantly think about the issue. I’m not diagnosed with anxiety so I can’t say I have it. I did have it as a child, up until I was about eight or so. I’ve started dealing with panic attacks as well in the last few years, but I haven’t had any for some time now. Because of all of that I suspect I may have anxiety, but I’m not sure. I may just be overwhelmed, stressed, or just a nervous person. Another major issue I’ve been dealing with is anger. I am almost certain that I struggle with some degree of anger issues. I would say I’m quite an irritable person, I do get angry or annoyed easily sometimes. But there are certain moments where my anger goes off the rails. Its almost always because of something small. The last instance of this was today. I won’t go in to detail about the whole situation, but I completely lashed out at my sister for something minute. It was something worth being frustrated over, but my anger was completely out of hand. I screamed at her to the point where my throat hurt, then went upstairs and ended up punching my closet door. I feel my anger very physically. Whenever I feel this extreme anger I feel the overwhelming urge to beat, punch, or kick something. Most of the time I can contain it, but it’s very difficult. That overwhelming feeling of wanting to fight is probably the most extreme emotion I’ve ever felt. This is an undeniable issue of mine, but I don’t really know what it is or what I can do about it. It may just be straight up anger issues, but I’ve also thought that it may be bipolar disorder considering I experience depressing as well. I figured it could be due to my mood swings, but I’m not well versed on the disorder so I may be completely wrong. I just feel helpless when it comes to what to do about my anger. I have some other struggles that my be linked to some disorder, but aside from depression I think these two are the most important to get taken care of. The feelings of anxiety I get have made it really difficult to get important things done. I start school in September, so there is a lot to be done with course selection, enrolment, scheduling, tuition payments, etc. What I’ve been feeling has made it very difficult to work through all of that, and I’m afraid it’ll continue to affect me in school as well. As I said my anger is very extreme. Though it doesn’t get very extreme too frequently, when it does it’s bad. It’s resulted in me hurting myself before and I’m afraid of it getting worse. I don’t know what exactly these two issues could be. What’s worse is that I don’t have a reliable doctor to speak to about all of this. My family doctor is truly one of the most incompetent professionals I’ve ever spoken to. She has not responded correctly to any of my or the rest of my family’s issues. To put it into perspective a bit; I’m actually dealing with a crazy infection right now. I went to see her first and she didn’t prescribe me anything. I spoke to a specialist recently and they told me it was absurd that I wasn’t given antibiotics. She’s not much better when it comes to mental health. The first time I spoke to her about feeling depressed all she told me was that I needed to start working out. She’s not helpful at all, and I can’t confidently talk to her about any of these issues. I can’t speak to a psychiatrist either. There aren’t any taking clients in my city, and I can’t drive so I have no access to any outside of my city either. My mom is also against me seeing one for some reason. Even before I was prescribed medication for my depression she wouldn’t allow me to see a psychiatrist, saying it wouldn’t do me any good. Thankfully I was able to convince my doctor to get me medication after asking her about depression about four times. So in conclusion, I really don’t know what to do. I don’t know what I’m struggling with, I don’t have anyone to help me through it, and overall I feel like I’m lost. Any input would be appreciated, whether it’s ideas on what steps I should take, input on what I could be dealing with, or just support in general. All would be appreciated. Thank you to anyone that took the time to read this.",24Aug2020,1
226,"Hey guys so i had my 1st college class yesterday and my prof had us introduce ourselves and my anxiety spiked up. I kinda fucked up and spoke too fast and i cried after (yes childish, but thats what my anxiety does to me) And now he says he wants everyone to turn on webcams for upcoming classes and. I physically. Mentally. Cannot. 

I can barely speak on a mic and i have extremely low self-esteem so being on cam will just have me lose all focus on the class itself and it would result in an anxiety attack.

So basically i have a choice to drop this class and go to another prof who doesn’t require cams or mic and I really want to do that, but i wouldn’t grow as a person.

Can anyone give me advice on what i should do?! And please dont sugarcoat it, i know that i need to get over my anxiety to function in the real world even if it means making myself suffer.
Thank you",24Aug2020,1
227,"I think I just need to vent but I don’t know. If you have any life advice that would be wonderful too. 

This past year has been so overwhelming. I’m sure it has for a lot of people. I just feel like I’m going to explode from how stressed out I am. Last fall I did explode I tried to kill myself at college and was shuffled away to a mental hospital. I was diagnosed with bipolar. I was put on medication and sent on my way with no guidance on what to do. The line to see help at my practice is 2 months long and that’s just to get in line to get a referral to the psychiatrist which is a 6 month wait. And I was almost to my appointment when Covid Hit, so now I’m still on the wait list and I’ve run out of meds. I started a new job that I hate but it pays well. however, every time I go in I think about killing myself or I feel like I’m about to explode. I honestly just want to go back to school but I know I can’t because I’m mentally unwell and I have bills. My last uni didn’t really allow students to hold down a normal job because of how wacky their schedules were. 
Last time I felt well was when I was working full time and going to school full time at community college. I just want to go to school but I just can’t. I’m so unwell and I really want to die. 
I know I’m at a low point because I’ve stopped brushing my hair and putting self tanner on. I know that sounds so stupid but that’s what happened last time before I tried to kill myself. I just need help. Fuck Medicaid fuck how useless it is. Fuck everything. I just want to be normal again.",24Aug2020,1

230,"So I've (M32) recently gotten out of a toxic marriage. I was being emotionally and physically abused (nothing too serious, but I was hit a couple time by my wife (F35 who we'll call Joanne)) for the past 6 out of 7 years, I hid and internalised all the pain and none of my friends had any idea that I was unhappy.  


Part of the reason I left is because an ex gf and long time friend (F41 who we'll call Rose) who I haven't been allowed to speak to in years. I spent about 3-4 weeks speaking to Rose behind Joanne's back which is something I had to do quite regularly with any female friends regardless of their status as x-gf or no. Joanne simply said that its not that she didn't trust me, but that she didn't trust the other women. So no female friends for me.   


Anyway, I speak to Rose and open up to her about my life and she starts pointing out that there's a fair few signs of abuse and points me towards a website where you have to tick each item you feel applies to you. I scored 31/32 on the red flags and so I started gearing up to leave, it took me about a week to actually get up the courage to do it, but I did.   


I left for home with my mum and sister and that was 4 months ago. About 3 months ago me and Rose got back together in a Long Distance relationship and honestly I felt extremely happy. Anyway, this happiness didn't last. I have a few habits that I've picked up from being in a toxic relationship and I'm not all that mentally stable and tbh neither is Rose. We're in the situation where we both want to be with each other because we love each other so much, but its just too much for either of us, but Rose especially, to handle. I think I want a relationship with Rose, but honestly that's probably the worst thing for me.   


Anyway, last week me and Rose broke up (It was 5/6 days ago now) and since then I've been kinda lost. We still talk and I'm not giving that away, I've gone 8 years without talking to my best friend and I'm not giving that up for anybody. But I'm starting to think that I'm addicted to attention from others, especially romantic partners. Like Joanne wasn't especially affectionate but she was there. And Rose can't be here but I used to talk to her every moment of every day when we were awake, and I think that was draining in its own way for rose as she has 2 twin teenagers and a 9 year old to look after as well as being a single parent with a super shitty house mate.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm spending tonight with no social media (he says on Reddit), but no facebook, no messenger, phone is off, and honestly I'm already really struggling. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have nay tips for me in this situation?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm keeping a mood diary and listing down feelings and emotions whenever I'm low, and I'm waiting to hear back on a referral to a counsellor.

232,"i’m apologize in advance for how long this is. 

I moved into college on the 21st so it’s been three days since i’ve been not anxious every single second. for background, every single morning before school from 6th grade to 10th I would puke because of my anxiety. During my junior year I got a therapist and meds, school seemed to be my main trigger but after a threw up on my first date with my ex I was officially diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder. I’ve tried all the techniques, I still have my journal from all the sessions. The only thing that worked was breaking up and having only three close friends. Eventually I was diagnosed with an Unidentifiable Eating Disorder caused by my anxiety. Basically what happens when I go on vacation or start school is I puke and feel nauseous and can’t eat for days. Therefore I lose weight and lose the desire to eat at all even when i’m not nauseous. 

Anyways back to now. The only things I’ve been able to consume in the past few days are 2 cups of white rice (right before bed so I don’t encounter anyone to make me anxious) and half a smoothie (i drank half and puked it up then drank the other half and somehow I held it down). I’m tired of not being able to eat. I feel light headed and like i’m going to faint. I even threw up pure water cause I took a walk with a guy I just met. I’m currently on Zoloft but it doesn’t help since my only symptom is puking. My mom said I should try to get my hands on some Dramamine which is apparently anti nausea. I just need something long enough for my stomach to calm and let me eat and digest. Because nausea combined with 90 degree heat and no ac is hell. I just feel so lethargic and unmotivated. 

All the friends i’ve made have been really supportive and want to help so that’s nice but it doesn’t do much. I’ve been thinking about going to the school health center instead of the therapist since this is effecting me more physically than mentally at the moment. I hate losing weight because I feel like i’m going to die. And I don’t want to die with a card in my hand that lets me get food whenever I want. Help I need some guidance.",24Aug2020,1
233,"(Trigger warning: self-harming) 

Because of my horrible socialization skills and severe social anxiety, I haven't had real friends since middle school.
I suffer from an unspecified mood disorder as I'm too young (17) to be diagnosed, or so I've been told.
I've been hospitalized twice in the span of two years and been on medication for almost 4 years.
Why should that matter now? Well, my best (and only) friend comes from a similar background.
The only difference is that she deals with her issues in extremely unhealthy ways, such as constant self-harming and surrounding herself with toxic people.
As saddened as I am about her bad habits, I also happen to slip into a spiral self-inflicted pain from time to time, so I can't criticize her for something she can't help and try to be there for her when she needs me.
The main thing that bothers me is her behavior towards me when she's around her friends.
They'll basically ignore me most of the time and joke around about things that really shouldn't be taken as something quirky. Now, I'm all for dark humor, but when a 12 year old ends up lying down on the street just to prove how fearless and bold they are... That's where I cross the line.
Not to mention all the drama that's always surrounding them. Sleeping with one another, petty fights, running away from the rest of the group, tears, panic attacks, you name it.
There's this one ""friend"" of hers that has hurt my friend multiple times in the past, without ever being sorry. This person is the embodiment of the cool kid stereotype: doing drugs, not caring about anything, having sex with all of their friends, etc.
When I was hospitalized, we were in the same facility. They would try to get close to me and hug me without even really knowing who I was, and lost interest when they saw I wasn't interested in a short-lasting ""crazy"" relationship.
When I asked them why they didn't talk to my friend anymore, they replied with ""Who? I do that with lots of people, I don't even remember"". I got irritated because I thought my friend didn't deserve to have someone like that in her life (I've had my fair share of toxic people, so I know how to spot one).
Now they're all friends again and I rarely talk to my friend anymore.
She would ask me to let her stay at my house so that she could see her toxic friends in secret without her dad knowing, and I agreed because I didn't really see that coming. We would have a nice time at my house, and then she would randomly ask me to go out to see her friends at night. I was extremely reluctant but always said okay because I was scared of upsetting her.
We even went to an empty Irish bar and the bartender handed us some liquor without asking for our age, and insisted we drank it. I did, and felt sick to my stomach because of how strong it was.
My friend in the meantime went to the bathroom with that person and another obnoxious friend of hers, and did some things I don't even wanna know about.
Yesterday we went out to go to the mall, and I had so much to tell her about my recent trip to Croatia to see my boyfriend, but we barely talked. We just shopped for gifts she wanted to give her new girlfriend, and said bye to each other.
I'm honestly so hurt because I've been trying to be a good friend all these years, and I don't wanna lose the only person that I talk to in real life.
I've been unable to go to school normally since the start of high school so I'm basically homeschooled, which means I can't make any friends there (or anywhere else).
I hate being used by my only friend, but at the same time I'm terrified of being alone again.

I hope someone can give me some advice, that would be extremely appreciated.
Lots of love to everybody who managed to read this far!",24Aug2020,1

Does anyone else feel like they can’t forget a memory that is connected to a certain smell?
I have it a lot, but it he most problematic and extreme one that bothers me the most is the smell of autumn... 
I’m from a country that doesn’t have an autumn and since I was very young my family and I used to travel to Europe in autumn and it was always my very favorite smell, it made me so so happy and excited in a very deep level. 
4 years ago I moved to Europe. I got into a very toxic relationship for almost two years, the first autumn was the most amazing time of my life, I was the happiest. The second autumn was when everything went down, the relationship ended and went through the worst time of my life. 
I’m still far from healing and my mental health is severely damaged. I can avoid my Ex but I can’t avoid autumn forever and I don’t know what to do. 
It’s getting close. Last year I avoided it by going back home for a bit more than a month, but I don’t know if it will be possible this year because of corona. 
Yesterday it was a bit colder and raining and when I opened the window a chill wind smells like autumn came in my apartment, I started to feel like I’m about to have a panic attack and cried a lot and didn’t go out at all.

i fully believe i have OSDD-1B. that is dissociative identity disorder, but i do not experience dissociative amnesia. i fit all of the criteria from the research i have done. i have two “others,” and i feel as though i become them. my opinions and identity totally changes. my name and sense of appearance does as well, although i am not totally uncomfortable in my body when i “become them,” or when they are in control. i can speak to them. they are individuals in my own knowledge of my mind. 

my therapist believes that i am experiencing changes in identity/depersonalization due to stress. i do not commonly feel stress, and i do not experience what i believe to be alter fronts during extreme stress. she knows that, but says that i am constantly stressed, which is why it is happening. 

i don’t know what to believe. i said i feel like she doesn’t believe me but she assured me that she does and she thinks they’re different people, but then the next day she’ll tell me that they’re not real. in her totally clinical language she believes that i am experiencing dissociative episodes due to stress.

my parents urge me to put her feelings above professionalism. she had me do EMDR even after i started experiencing constant “voices,” but when i finally found out that these symptoms were due to EMDR, she said she knew all along. i thought this overstepped my bounds. she also once yelled at me (not loudly but she looked very scared i think?) and said that my alters were not real people at all and i cannot think of them that way. i cried for hours and my parents said i was being extremely selfish for not taking her feelings into account. 

she said there is no way i have “multiple personalities,” because it is too rare and the trauma that causes it is too bad. this hurt me because i was molested as a very young child for multiple years and i have suffered the trauma from it for my whole life. but my parents say that i cannot know if it was bad enough for multiple personalities because i don’t remember much of it. they accused me of trying to be special. i am worried that maybe i am. maybe they are not what i want to hear simply because i wish i was special. i know having DID is somewhat of a “cool” point now. i wish i didn’t have to deal with this dissociation, though. i love my alters, they are truly kind, but the way i have been treated throughout this feels horrifying whether i have it or not.

obviously, the way i describe these events is bound to be biased. please, i want someone to tell me, in an unbiased way, if these identities can truly appear due to stress. honestly, am i overreacting to this? should i try to take her feelings more into account than i have?",24Aug2020,1

The last couple of days I've finally been able to help my gf unpack, started cooking an showering again, and the place finally started to feel like a home. 
Que today. The landlord came over without an appointment. My girlfriend didn't know any better and let him in because she thought she had to. After checking everything (including the bedroom while I was sleeping.. I woke up halfway through) he started to tell her she needs to clean up the house and he would expect better after 2 months. She told him 3 times we are working on it, but he just kept saying we are not. He left pretty angry and said he'd be back in a week. 
About an hour or 2 later the realtor comes over. He's been pretty nice so far, so we thought he could help solve this issue before it got out of hand. I was in the bedroom again because we had a dog over and the realtor didn't want him around so I took the dog, but I was able to hear everything. 
He told my gf we weren't really trying, and just needed some organization. He told her to get ""those things"" (her one tiny piercing) out of her nose, look for a job and everything would be fine. No therapist needed. He said we needed to adapt, or else we would always be the scum of society. He basically told us we wouldn't be able to find another home if we leave this one. All while he was saying this my gf was trying to explain while none of this was true and his voice kept getting louder. Poor doggy was also getting anxious and really wanted to go out of the room to help her, but I was scared the realtor might get angry at him. Then the realtor noticed some of the stuff we had bought for the 2 cats we are getting this Sunday. He proceeded to yell that there was no way there were gonna be cats or any type of animal. My gf said we were in our rights to do so, especially since I need them for my extreme anxiety. He kept on yelling and asking why she was so stubborn and that she needed to change herself in order to fit in. She then asked him 5 times to leave until he did leave. 
An hour later the handyman showed up, probably also to talk to us. But we didn't open the door because we're both super scared. 
I don't know how to translate it well, but it really sounded like he was threatening us and our cats. 
I don't know what to think or feel... I'm so scared we're gonna have fights like this all the time. And I'm scared he might actually do something to hurt us or our cats. Fights like these also bring up PTSD for me, so I haven't been doing very well the last couple of hours.",24Aug2020,1

I tend to near flunk my fall semesters, I lose a lot of friends, if I’m with someone romantically I’ll usually end it or they will due to my behavior. Rest of the year I’m as happy as can be, motivated, a good listener, and have tons of hobbies I’m passionate about. 

I am currently with someone and have made some really nice friends. I really don’t want to let them go, but I’m already sabotaging these relationships and I can’t control it. If anyone has any idea why I get so... erratic during this season or experiences the same thing please let me know! I really want to keep it under control this year. Anything helps(: thank you in advance.",24Aug2020,1
248,"My partner is out of town and I’ve been on my own for 5 days now. I’ve had no calls, no messages and no human contact apart from the lady at the post office. 

I started to spiral last night, but managed to get myself to bed and woke up fine. I’ve been disassociating all weekend and realising how much of the past week I’ve lost to overthinking.

An Instagram post I saw of a close friend and an ex-friend hanging out has put me over the edge. I’m fed up of putting so much energy into people who just don’t care. People who don’t reach out first, people who ignore my messages. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. 

I’ve lived in a completely different city from the majority of my close friends for a year now, and haven’t been able to make any new friends.  Not working has completely screwed with my mind for the last 5-6 months and I don’t know how much more I can take.

My friend who I spoke to anything mental health related for the past 10 years passed away in March from an epileptic fit. I don’t know how to talk to anyone else. My partner helps when he’s home but in a way that helps me forget what’s going on in my head. He can only do so much and I know I’m becoming a burden on his own mental health.

250,"It feels like I've always been the least favourite in the groups of friends I've had. It's always been me in the middle, drifting between other people's groups, not fully accepted into one. The friend group I had last year collapsed after the 2 parted ways,  leaving me with no one. I talk to them online sometimes, but can I say they're genuinely my friends? No. Do we talk in real life? No. These other couple of friends I had at school all do shit without me. They get on with their lives, while I wallow on what once was. 

I wish I didn't push my childhood friends away. They were some of the best people in my life, and I left them. I was shit to them and went off to other people, only for that to crumble in my desperate hands.

I have no one I can really talk to. I haven't stayed in contact with those I talk to at school over the lockdown and I'm worried that they'll now be next to move on entirely. When we go back to school, I'll have no one. No one at school. No one online. No one in real life.

255,"i'm gonna put a trigger warning cause this might get dark



so i'm almost 100% sure i suffer from anxiety. I know self diagnosing is not good so i'm not saying that for a fact but i definitely feel anxious about everything most of the time and it has affected my life in more ways than one. i am constantly worrying about things that arent even a big deal and i overthink myself to the point where i stress over scenarios that might not even happen. I worry about how people perceive me and i often feel like i'm not good enough. i just get very anxious and i know it goes beyond just feeling anxious sometimes and is clearly not normal. it's hard to put into words but i spend a lot of my time worrying about most things. I've been feeling this way since i was 19. 


However, i'm wondering if my problems go beyond that and i'm starting to become concerned that i might be depressed as well. I have no self worth. I actually legitimately hate myself. I'm not saying that to be trendy or seem cool, (as i know some people think its trendy to pretend they hate themselves). I hate how i look, how i dress, how i act, i hate my personality, (except my sense of humor) and besides the fact that i'm kind and i have a good sense of humor, i dont think i have any redeeming qualities. Its come to the point where when people show me genuine kindness i assume they're being fake. I dont deserve to be loved. I dont think anyone genuinely wants to be around me and have even convinced myself my own friends who i have known for years hate me. I dont care to be healthy or take care of myself because i dont think i'm worth it. i drink and smoke because i just dont care. I've gotten drunk ever night this week because i just want to feel good. It seems like i'm only happy at work because i can forget about my feelings but when i get home im not. i'm not suicidal and i have no plans to take my iwn life, but a lot of the time i feel like im better off dead. if i were to die i dont think it would really affect anyone. i dont think i have any impact on people. i see myself as a worthless piece of shit who doesnt contribute anything and i dont think i have a future. i'm just a loser and i fucking hate myself. 



i know i should probably get help but idk how to go about it. i dont really have the money and being in a pandemic is just making it harder. Is there any online resources i can turn to?

Last month has been rough for me, to say the least. 

I was very anxious about my birth control. I felt like I could not, well, control it, so I was just absolutely overwhelmed and scared, which resulted in a series of mental breakdowns. 

Later on, when I have finally found peace with it and decided to give hormonal birth control a try, I thought I was over it. Turns out, I had some more health complications to fix, which were rough on me again. I concluded that I have serious health problems anxiety which are the result of suppressed emotions and decided to dig into my brain and fix it. 

Bum, I did it, I realized what was wrong and that I need to let some things go. Later on, I finally start hormonal birth control. Not even 5 days in, I notice acne. I am so frustrated. 

I know that this might not be a result of birth control, since there were sudden changes in my diet and Make-up, but i cannot let this anxiety go. I am so scared I did it to myself. I have a very good skin naturally, so I am extremely worried and sad. 

I am trying my best to keep myself calm, but I notice that I have more and more crying sessions and breakdowns. I don’t want my family and my boyfriend to deal with a sobbing mess of a person and I feel very selfish to cry about simple couple of innocent pimples, but I can’t help it. It feels like I am drowning. This circle of problems is still there even though I know that I have solved nearly all of them. 

I am now disappointed in myself, since of the acne is in fact hormonal, then I did it to myself. I am guilty of it, but I also will have to deal with it since I want to be on birth control. I am devastated. 

On top of that, I really do have an amazing boyfriend that loves me, and I feel like i am such a bad person to him lately, with all the crying and self-centered behavior. I want to change, but every time I try, I am lost and end up having another problem pop up.

Guess I am just becoming an adult atm (I’m 19) and start to deal with real problems, but I find it so difficult to manage my emotions and my behavior. I know that I can do it, but right now I am so helpless it seems.

I am still doing well not using effexor or any other drugs, just the aminos.

My dosage is 1500mg 3x tyrosine and 1000 2x tryptophan, i pretty much take it until the bottle is gone which usually contains 120 tablets.  


The pills i take are 500mg each so i take that much a few times and gradually increase into the max dosage, some might not need the max but it works better for me. For me the effects typically last a few mth before i need to use the amino acids again. I use the brand Superior Labs as they dont use other chemicals or fillers in their pills.

&amp;#x200B;

The Mood Cure book pretty much explains everything in detail, its a book for dummies, i personally got the ebook version so that i could quickly review it if i forget something. I pretty much never buy books so thats says how great this book is.  


There are other recommendations aside from aminos, but the book recommends at least trying those, and then using the other alternatives. I do have OCD and ADD as well and it hasnt helped with those illnesses, i will continue to look for a natural approach to healing those.",24Aug2020,1

I apologise in advance for the length of this post. 

***TL;DR: I've had a really rough 6 months, and I'm exhausted by my parents who keep hassling me for updates on my situation which isn't changing.***

**The situation:**               
Ever since early November 2019, things have taken a turn for the worst. At that time I lost my job due to mass-layoffs. It's important to note that my job is not only my income, but also the sponsorship of my visa to remain living and working in the US (I'm from Australia, if it matters). This meant I had 60 days to get another job or return home. 

I am also paying a mortgage in Sydney, and paying rent in NYC (both very expensive cities). So money is already tight, and unemployment isn't an option for me. 

During my 60 day grace period, the Australian fires happened and I lost two friends and my grandfather. I couldn't attend their funerals as I couldn't leave the US at the time. Separately to this, I was meant to go back home for xmas, but that trip was cancelled due to my job situation. My dog back home also passed away December 21st, and I'm still devastated by all of this. 

I managed to secure a job in time at a workplace that turned out to be super toxic in mid-December and was miserable the entire time. People were constantly bullied by management until they quit. I witnessed this multiple times in the 5 months I was there. Then they made layoffs due to COVID. I was one of those. 

I am grateful not to be there anymore, but I haven't had a job in 3 months, despite my best efforts. I am now overstaying my grace period, as I am currently unable to get a travel exemption to go back to Australia. 

I'm working every day on securing another job ASAP. But as I need a visa, there are requirements I have to meet, so unfortunately not just any job will do. I've been interviewing a lot, but following the recently signed executive orders around visas, most employers aren't considering sponsorships. Not to mention, we are in a recession. 

**The advice:**             
My parents and I (29F) have never been close. We don't have a good relationship, but it's been slowly getting better these past couple of years. I'm trying not to do the nuclear option here. 

My parents keep asking me for updates on my situation, how I'm doing etc. I've told them a number of times that nothing has changed. I keep interviewing, getting to final rounds, and then told they can't make the visa work. And no, I'm not feeling better about the deaths of my loved ones as I haven't had a real opportunity to process any of it. It's demoralising to have to keep reliving this every time they message me asking for an update. 

I have told them this directly. That I don't have the time or energy to keep updating them when nothing has changed. And that if/when there's a significant update, I'll let them know. Until then, please stop asking. 

I have said this 2-3x, I've also ignored several messages asking for updates since then. 

Today my dad messaged me again asking for an update. It's exhausting, and so upsetting not to have my boundaries respected when I'm trying to focus on digging myself out of a hole. Clearly being direct hasn't worked. Ignoring them hasn't worked. What else can I do?

It seems like maybe I can't change their behaviour. Can I change my thinking? I really, really need to fix this distress and frustration ASAP. 

**The impact:**          
I have a history of depression and anxiety. At times it's been very, very bad. My situation already has me so on edge that I ended up in the ER (uninsured) for stress cardiomyopathy a couple of weeks ago. That also came with a very expensive bill, so I'm keen not to repeat that.

Now I'm hyperfocused on ONLY two things:

(1) finding a job ASAP, and              
(2) trying to lessen my stress and take care of my mental and physical health. 

Constantly being asked for an update when there's no update to give, and after I've requested space, is really frustrating. Any advice would be appreciated.

276,"**TLDR at the end!**

I'm a 22 year old male college student finishing up my senior year, and should be on my way to transition to my professional career as soon as this coronavirus craziness dies down and allows for the amount of travelling the job involves. I'm a movie fanatic, dabble in PC gaming (although I could really use some new hardware), and enjoy most outdoor activities like camping and hiking. 

I'm 6'1"" and about 170lbs, reasonably athletic, and *try* to dress well. 

I try to keep my life as average as possible. I don't go out of my way to seek attention, usually I'm happy to just do my own thing and let others do their. Well, life decided that was too much to ask for and decided to throw me a curve ball.

Ever since puberty kicked off, I've been developing into a man at a rate of about 1/16th of an inch a month.... go ahead and reread that, fire up your calculator, whatever you need to do. 

My doctor can't find anything medically wrong with me, and all my blood work checks out. As far as he can tell this is just how I am. He's prepared me for the possibility that things may not slow down or stop until my mid-20s, although this would be rare. 

But OP! That sounds like an absolute blessing and a dream come true for hundreds of people!! You should be thankful!! 

Yeah well... it was fun at first, but when you have to wake up every day and face the world, all sorts of things get inconvenient very quickly. 

There a dozens of issues I have to manage that most people don't seem to have to think about. Buying clothes is a nightmare. Exercise is uncomfortable. Sex and dating is a disaster. And the big one... society and people in general. 

Society loves, *loves*, ***loves***, to obsess over this topic. Guys brag to anyone who will listen, truthful or not. Girls brag to their friends. Jokes are made everywhere. Media, especially music, won't shut up about it. All sorts of products promising to give you one are marketed universally. There are even categories of videos online dedicated to it. 

...and yet it is still a taboo topic to seriously discuss with nearly anyone, at least in the USA. 

NO ONE seems willing to accept it may not be the most wonderful thing to ever happen to a person. But you won't even get that far because no one will believe you in the first place if you bring it up. 

I've been harassed, groped, ogled, sneakily photographed, lost friends, dumped or refused by partners or potential partners, and caught in the middle of drama all because of it. I hate the attention it brings. 

But people are SO stuck on the idea that it is a wonderful thing and can't possibly have any downsides that I've yet to find a single trustworthy person who's given me the time of day and just listened to me or let me rant or wanted to try and understand what I go through. So I just bottle it up inside and try to move on with my life and pretend it isn't a source of anxiety for me.

**TLDR: I've grown about 1/16th of an inch (yes...there) a month since puberty started (I'm 22 now) and it's more of a curse than a blessing. Society disagrees with me on that so the stress and issues it creates for me get bottled up inside, which isn't healthy for my mental state and makes me feel like an outsider, freakshow, whatever you wanna call it.**

So... thanks for making it this far and if you'd like to AMA then please do. Honestly anything, as long as it's respectful and genuine, will help take some of this stress off my shoulders at this point.

I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to move on past this hang up in my life? I have no idea how to handle this in a positive manner that doesn't result in fucking up relationships with friends, family, and partners. It just doesn't seem like something most people are willing to give the time of day and legitimacy to.",24Aug2020,1
278,"I had a weird experience yesterday.   
A bit of background: I have occasional bouts of deep depression in between managing it and being able to function the rest of the time (with some work).  Along with the depression comes crippling anxiety.  
Yesterday I had been so anxious all day and seemingly my system had had enough.  I definitely didnt faint and didn't feel physically out of sorts other than just being really spaced out in my mind.  I can remember suddenly feeling really detached and lying down, my husband then found me asleep on the spare room floor just next to our sofa bed.   
I know I didnt faint as I remember purposefully lying down on the floor, physically in control of my body. I must have fallen to sleep instantly and I'm not sure how that's possible. 
I wasnt at all sleep deprived that day and I've never been able to suddenly fall asleep.  Also I was right next to the sofa bed so why didnt I lie there?     
I found it really wierd and worrying.  It's never happened before and hope it doesnt happen again.  I literally just curled up on the floor from where I was standing and went straight to sleep immediately even though I didnt feel at all restful and was so stressed.  Has anyone else experienced this?",24Aug2020,1
279,"Like the title says, I feel like somethings wrong with me and I can’t figure out what it is. I think I may have ocd but don’t deal with the compulsion part of that so I think it may just be intrusive thoughts. I just have the same reoccurring tragic thought, I won’t describe it but it’s about suicide. I used to be more afraid of it but realized that’ll make it worse so I just acknowledge the thought and let it pass. I don’t get it as often as I used to. I think I may have depression. I’ve been becoming irritable. Sometimes I have an urge to throw something because of how misunderstood I feel sometimes by people. When I get out of my house I’m just not happy and act negative, and then I hate myself for being negative around the people I was with. I’ve been noticing that It’s been very easy to cry for me. Even in the most normal situations like eating at the dinner table with my family and stuff like that. I’ve had a lost of appetite. I skipped breakfast this morning actually and that was because I wanted to work out and I’m supposed to work out on an empty stomach other wise I feel like throwing up. I can’t finish my food anymore, it’s just too overwhelming and it’s too hard to. I don’t want to tell my parents/family members about this because I’ll feel like they’ll see me as a burden to them.

280,"TRIGGER WARNING SEXUAL ASSAULT

I was raped at 18. I was unconscious due to being dropped on my head (spiked which led to an easy attack+concussion caused by head injury), i had other injuries all over my body from bruises to long lasting joint issues in multiple places + mental trauma im dealing with

I see the man often as he lives in my town, hes approached me once after the rape asking if i remembered him, i didnt at first but the it clicked and i ran awAy and hid in the club bathroom and cried with my friend until he was removed from the club - i was clearly incapacitated during the attack but  he obviously ignored it.  
Ive caught him once watching me with my dog, he was behind a van smoking a cigarette with his hood up, i left very quickly. 

The police are involved and it will be going to court soon and it looks as if there is enough evidence for a prosecution or whatever the term was. 

Im now 20 and im slowly starting to struggle even more because of pandemic, i lost my job, my “friends” dont bother with me and i have no family. My bf is supportive and helpful but i dont want to talk to him about it because its obviously difficult to see your gf cry her eyes out over something that happened on a night he was present, it was a night out and i was led away from my bf (then friend). My bf struggled for awhile, he would get defensive if any man came near me, he was looking for a fight - i think he felt guilt as on the night bf and rapist were talking outside club, bf goes to help our friend who fell over and turns around to see me gone. He could of struggled with the fact he spoke with the man who would rape his friend/girlfriend.

I havent been diagnosed with ptsd but i think i have symptoms of it. Im waiting to get therapy but my gp said ptsd is a possibility especially with what happened and how i feel etc.  

My emotions are all over, sometimes im incredibly angry and i want to hit something or scream, Im paranoid and sometimes i’ll just cry for hours on end in bed. I sometimes suddenly become really depressed to the point i wont eat or sleep, i’ll be thinking of jumping off a bridge or putting a knife into myself. I have froze up in public once because someone who wore a similar coat to the rapist walked by me, i froze and put myself in a corner and had a panic attack. I get scared when people walk behind me, im constantly scared. I have anxiety attacks and panic attacks often. I dont like going out without my dog as she will stop and stare if someone is near  which is an alert for me to where people are and its unlikely someone will try hurt me with a dog around. 

Ive been having flashbacks or nightmares about the attack and visions of me killing the guy. Its scary, my thoughts are so violent and i know im very capable of doing something like that if i was distressed enough which makes it even worse. Its like im trying to convince myself to do something to him or his car, thoughts of keying it or spraying rapist on it. Thoughts of smashing his head into the ground and scraping his skin off like he did me (dropped on head and skin taken of my spine from being raped on gravel). Ive had mental health issues since i was a child and when stressed/overwhelmed i used to hurt myself somehow, occasionally i have thoughts of cutting myself just for a pain release. I drive myself crazy most of the time with the thoughts i have. 

I havent been able to focus on anything since, i barely remember stuff. Ive had issues in work because of it all, i dont function anymore. I dont feel the same, my brain isnt the same. Its like adhd, my mind is going a million miles an second going nowhere but in circles. I dont feel right, i feel broken inside more andmore each day. I was generally okay but now im thinking of it more because i lost my job and im too scared to work incase i see the guy - not working is stressing me out anyway because idk what to do about money. 

I cant enjoy sex as much anymore, i try my best to be present but occasionally i’ll have flash’s to the attack during sex but i carry on as i know im having sex with bf and try to focus on him. Im scared to do certain things because the action happened during the attack. 

Ive smoked weed basically everyday since i was 16 but now i cant manage without it, it helps suppress the thoughts of the attack. This year i started taking cocaine if i didnt have any weed. I know weed can make people paranoid etc but ive honestly been fine prior to the attack, only affect the drug gives me is extreme hunger. 
I dont even like cocaine, i just need a buzz to keep my head off the rape. If theres no weed or cocaine then i drink, i always have backup booze. 

I feel like im slowly becoming undone, i have the urges to do spontaneous shit like trim my long hair to short, be walking and i suddenly want to run like usian bolt, ive now started thinking of laying in my bath with something over the top, like its a box, a safe place i guess.",24Aug2020,1

287,"I finally started taking them again a day or two ago, and although I have absolutely no training at all in diagnosing people I feel like I might have excoriation disorder. Normally I stay up late at night on somewhat daily basis (which I think is just my adderall still existing in my bloodstream maybe) and like 6 out of ten times I go to the bathroom or see a mirror and have in the past spent sometimes up to 6 hours just picking at my face. I just stand in-front of the bathroom mirror, or even in-front of my long tall mirror in my room after just gently grazing an odd bump of some sort on my face or body.  And I’ll just pick the ever living shit out of my face and body every pimple, white head, black head, clogged pore, slight bump on my face, old scabs from picking at acne in the past the days. And I’m pretty sure the reason it starts is because I see a really noticeable bump or pimple and it fills me with so much anxiety and disgust that I end up ravaging my face until finally I zone out of my extreme focus and realize my entire face and sometimes chest is red and covered in now small cuts. Which I know sounds bad enough just by itself but uh usually it’s just my from my shoulders up that get affected. However I think the what I ended up doing yesterday was most likely because of how immediately I started taking my normal daily dose and reintroducing my body to my pills because of how long my body has been without my daily medication I think it went into over drive. I ended up picking at every small bump of dry skin, or small bump that I could possibly reach whether it be a underdeveloped white head or just a goose bump. I even ended up picking at way too many of those little weird bumps on my areola, so much so that I think the centre of my right boob near the areola started to swell because of how aggressively I was digging into it with my little to no nails. Even worse is that since I’m super skinny because of adderall XD suppressing my appetite I can almost always have enough reach to get a perfect view and of all the acne on my lower back and butt. Which I picked at so much it started bleeding a fair amount like the areas near my areolas, and i woke up today looking like my entire body is covered in chicken pox. 
Does this sound more like a really aggressive reaction to my normal prescription dose that I should be taking every day instead of taking again after a two week break, or does this sound like some serious or obvious symptoms of just a really bad anxiety episode or is it more like an underlying problem that I should talk to my doctor about. 


Sorry about this being such a long and exhausting story, as well as it being probably filled with way too many unnecessary details and stuff by my brain is struggling to even stay awake because I’m just so mentally exhausted. Honestly if I can gain even the smallest bit of advice or knowledge about what is most likely going on, I would greatly appreciate it.

289," 2 years ago my dad died, and in order to deal with it I swapped my feelings for the void, I don't feel sad unless I'm getting suicide level depression episode, and those go as soon as I figure out a way to throw those feelings into the trash. 

My main problem is that along with my feelings went my empathy, I can't empathise with my boyfriend who had depression and anxiety, I just don't understand how he let's it affect him, death of loved ones don't make me feel anything other than the irritation at the inconvenience even if I know that I loved that person, and that I should in fact be sad, to me in my current state crying or feeling sad won't change the fact that they're dead so there's no point in feeling sad. 

The only feelings I do have and experience 24/7 is anger, I'm angry and irritated at everything, I don't know what's happening in my brain, but I know it's not normal. 

I don't crave social interaction, I stopped talking to most of the people I considered friends after I started feeling like I might be a bother, I didn't like the way that felt so I cut them all off. 

Does anyone else have this problem?",24Aug2020,1
290,"Hello there. I don't know if this is the right place to share this, and I apologize in advance for sharing negative stuff. I've looked for places where I can talk about this. Oh, and please excuse my English, in case some errors pop out, it's not my first language. Anyways, I'm a 23 year old male. I've been dealing with increasing sadness since age 14. It was nothing serious until I was around 16. It took me a long time to seek professional help, which I finally did at age 19. Started attending sessions with my psychologist twice per week. Nothing remarkable happened during that time. However, around the beginning of 2017 I started developing anxiety, and disturbing thoughts or fantasies about self harm/self mutilation, that continued to increase until I couldn't handle it anymore and told my parents about it. They did not quite understand it. My dad studied psychology, but currently works as book editor. They are not exactly ""very religious"" but they adviced me to be more in touch with God. In regards to my beliefs, I would say I'm skeptical, I neither confirm nor reject God's existence. While I told them I would try to ask for God's help, I also said I wanted to try other options. When I told my psychologist about it she sent me with a psychiatrist. My parents were pretty mad because they really don't believe in psychiatry, and would tell me that my psychologist was making me believe I was some sort of maniac so I would let them dose me with substances. They very reluctantly agreed to let me meet the psychiatrist. There, he diagnosed me with Dysthymia, initially, and then with Primarily Obsessional Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. My parents rejected such diagnosis and told me I was being brainwashed into believing I am mentally sick. Psychiatrist advised me to start taking Paroxetine, and I later switched to Fluoxetine, 'cause Paroxetine was apparently messing up with my sleeping patterns. I was doing fine until the pandemic, and I was actually about to stop taking fluoxetine. I kept visiting both my psychologist, once a week, and psychiatrist, once every two months. Keeping up with the treatment proved very difficult, since my parents were really against the idea and argued that I had no problems at all. My dad would say that I had problems related with my relationship with him as a child that caused me a depression, but since we've discussed them extensively, the only problem I have now, according to him, is believing I am mentally sick. As I was saying, I was lowering my dose of daily fluoxetine when the pandemic arrived. During these last months of lockdown the thoughts about self-harm have come back. I got obsessed with the idea of open little wounds on the tip of my fingers or stabbing me with knives, introducing sharp objects into my ears, cutting me with scissors, leaving heavy objects fall on my feet, or hit my head with them, touching burning stuff, snort water, breathing heavily while drinking water, cutting myself with my jeans' zipper, pinching my nipples with pretty strong pliers opening the car's doors while in movement... unlike three years ago, I not only think about it, this time I've actually done it, which used to be my greatest fear. I thought the thoughts would go away once I committed them but they keep coming back and I feel like my brain is begging me and pushing me to do them over and over again. If I don't do it, it will sort of punish me with more anxiety. I live in constant horror wondering what will I come up next with, or how badly I could hurt myself with the next thing that comes to my mind. I try to hide knives, scissors and other sharp, heavy objects where I won't easily encounter them, and ask my parents occasionally not to leave them just anywhere in the house. They get angry, very angry. Like they really can't comprehend how someone ciuld think such awful stuff, but refuse to take me seriously. I've hinted them these thoughts are back, but they argue I had promised, and in fact I did, that I would stop taking medications and seeing both my psychiatrist and psychologist this year, back when I was doing okay. I seriously don't know what to do. Other thoughts related to incestuous things or searching for gore, satanism, torture, painful stuff at google have also come out. I am desperate, I am really, really desperate. I'm not a bad person, besides all the shit that's going on. I live terrified, and I seriously don't wish to live that way. I can't tell my parents, 'cause the just get angry, and now can't either talk to my psychiatrist or psychologist 'cause my parents won't give me money to have online sessions with them. So any kind of help or advice will be very, very, very appreciated. Thank you for reading and I apologize for such a lengthy post, I didn't think it would extend this much.",24Aug2020,1

I never had mania or depressed episode either and my mood swings don't last a week. I'm just prone to reckless behaviour. The majority of people don't see this side of me or think I'm clumsy and sweet but I'm very impulsive. The sexual occasional promiscuity - checked. If I fall for someone I'm obsessive. I often don't let guys go. If they wronged me I want revenge. I act not think. Never harmed myself or had suicidal thoughts. I always want to live and hate even seeing blood.
So I know I need to work on my issues. The problem is where the mental illness starts and normal behaviour ends? On PMS I'm more likely to cry and feel bad etc and often someone does something bad to me to cause me pain. The worst part is the stereotype guys often say ""all women are crazy"".

298,"   I was diagnosed with PTSD, ManicDepression, and Severe anxiety when I was 15. Long story short, at the beginning of high school I met a senior who didn’t understand the word no. After that I was more promiscuous, and I didn’t care about school. I did drugs and drank. I was raped, and assaulted by different people. I actually dropped out when I was 16. 
  Around that time I was “seeing” somebody who was 25. We weren’t really dating or sleeping together, I would just stay at his house and drink. One day I got black out drunk at his house and woke up with bruises on my neck, no pants and no memory other than being told I had to “catch up” on shots. Not long after that I flew from NC to Cali to be with the aforementioned “senior who doesn’t understand no”.   We were in a car accident where I suffered a broken collar bone, a shattered pelvis and a concussion. I think about these two incidents constantly. They intrude on my thoughts every day, several times a day. I’m 22 now, I thought I’d be better. My memory suffers greatly as well, my long term before the accident is okay but anything after is a mess. My short term, I’m like a goldfish. My theory is I had some kind of compounded trauma.

For example: if I were to look back at my memories, and remember myself doing something, I will literally imagine myself as a 50 year old man. Which is weird because, I am in fact, a 20 year old woman. Same goes for if I imagine myself doing something in the future. I will see myself as an old man, or on some occasions, a 5 year old girl.

309,"Normally I would ask a family member or a friend for a recomendation, but I don't know anyone who lives near me that I could ask as I'm new to the Boston area. I figure location shouldn't matter too much since we'll likely meet virtually for at least the next four months.

I recently went through a really brutal breakup and I've been struggling with depression and suicidality on and off for the last six months. I'm about to start up grad school again and need help, preferably from someone who is both empathetic and knowledgeable/up-to-date with respect to the best practices in their field (in my experience, most mental health practitioners seem to be one or the other).

r/mentalhealth members from the Boston area, who would you recommend?",24Aug2020,1
310,"I’m 25 and I have no friends. I’ve been a shy person my whole life, I’ve never been very social or had a social life even as a kid. I also have severe social anxiety which makes the situation even worse, because when I do meet people it’s very hard for me to keep a conversation going, and I tend to overthink everything which leads me to just give up.

I was really close one person and we were very close friends for almost a decade until he suddenly cut off all ties and communication with me when I got married and moved to a different country. I was already dealing with the stress of moving to a different country where I don’t know anyone except my husband and his family (in-laws from hell) and on top of that I had to deal with losing my best friend out of the blue.

Few years later I reconnected with his sister (we used to be friends before) and I asked if I can talk to him to at least get an answer why he suddenly cut all ties with me. We talked very briefly, he just said that we’re different people now so there’s no need to be friends or talk again. It broke my heart because the only person I was very close doesn’t even wanna talk to me anymore or at least know how I’m doing. I know I can’t force a person to stay friends with me, but it has affected me negatively.

I’ve been living in a new country for a few years and I’m finding it extremely hard to find any friends.  I live in the middle east so there’s not much to do without having to spend a huge amount of money. I don’t work (for reasons beyond my control) so I don’t have a work-life either. My husband tried to introduce me to some of his friends, but my anxiety gets in the way and people just think I’m being a bitch or I’m not interested.

I’ve been depressed for a really long time, I don’t even remember the last time I genuinely felt happy. I self-harm and I get suicidal thoughts that I try my best to control. I occasionally have anxiety attacks. I feel like I don’t even have control over my life. I almost lost my family who live in Beirut due to the recent explosion, which increased my anxiety attacks.

I try to stay away from social media, and looking at other people living their best life while I suffer silently. But it’s even the little things that make me sad like seeing people with their friends while I don’t have any friends. I know it’s pathetic, but it makes me feel like I’m the reason that I don’t have any friends, that I’m just not a likable person.

TL;DR: I’m 25 and I have no friends due to my extreme social anxiety. I lost the one person I was close to for almost a decade because he decided to just cut all ties with me. I’m depressed, I get anxiety attacks, I self-harm, and I have suicidal thoughts.",24Aug2020,1
311,"For a few months now I (18M) have been doing things that are self-destructive. I've been drinking a lot more than I usually do, purposefully listening to music at excessive volume (my hearing is very important to me), purposefully being an asshole to my friends and family irl and online as well as occasional physical self-harm. I've been sleeping poorly, barely been active and eaten mostly junk.  

My issue is that I have no idea what I can do about it and it's been happening a lot more frequently so I'm worried that, if I don't do something soon, I'm going to end up in prison, in hospital or dead. I need somewhere to go to for help but I don't have the money for it nor do I want to get my family involved cause I'm scared of how they'll treat me and I don't want to waste their money or disappoint them if I'm not better.

315,"I know things have been hard for everyone since covid 19 but I honestly don't know what's changed that much for me. That sounds like a good thing but ever since I graduated in 2019 i have mostly just been in my room. I convinced my parents to let me take a gap year to figure things out but mostly i took one because i wanted to start hrt before college (i'm trans). Over the past year I asked and asked them but they never scheduled an appointment until recently. This isn't really a new thing. They are always forgetful whenever I ask them for anything- like even though I started asking for an eye doctor appointment when I was a sophomore I didn't get glasses until near the end of senior year. But I don't know how seriously they take it tho seeing as my grandparents barely ever use the right pronouns. At least my dad tries though. 

This past year I don't even know what i've been doing. Everything has just blended together I guess. I was supposed to get a job and save some money. There was one month where i visited some family in another country (in 2019 - before covid) but that's probably the most productive thing i've done. My parents are expecting me to enroll in online classes (i'm already very late in the enrolling process) but I know that if I do then I won't be motivated to do the classes at all and my grades are going to be awful. I don't even know how long I've felt this way. I think I've been at least mildy depressed since middle school (gender dysphoria bcuz of puberty i suppose) and I remember high school being hell. Especially because I wasn't out to anyone until maybe the end of senior year. The friends I did have weren't the kinds of friends you hang out with outside of class or school. I get it though because whenever I do manage to be social I'm really annoying. I didn't even go to graduation. I know people think it's an important experience but I know it wouldve just been hell sitting there with all those people who could care less of me just for them to call my deadname on a stage in front of a hundred different families. 

I don't know why i'm writing this.. I guess i'm just desperate. I only really have one (online) friend and we don't talk that often anymore because they've been busy being an actual person lol. I thought I would finally be happy because I might be starting hrt soon but I'm just really depressed for some reason. I still haven't started - i have heard it improves your mood after you first start usually - but right now i'm just thinking about how long it will take before I even notice any changes and how even if i pass I don't have anything. I don't have any friends or a job and I don't know what I'm going to do for school. I just feel like I have no future and I'm just desperately trying to fulfill something that doesn't even matter. A lot of my time I spend at home when i'm not watching tv or whatever I'm just daydreaming about realities I'm not actually in and imagining a future i'll never have. I'm never even motivated to do things i used to like like reading or drawing. I just feel like such a leech seeing as I don't do anything for anybody but my parents still have to buy groceries for me and I still live with them even though in the past i had planned to move out by now. I can barely even go to the grocery store unless I go with someone else. Every second I'm in public i'm just hyperaware of everyone around me and I'm just wondering what theyre probably thinking about me.

I know I probably have social anxiety or something, or else i just really don't like people. But everything i try to do to improve myself and my schedule never works. I did have to go to a therapist once after something stupid I did in junior year but it never helped me at all. I could barely even talk to her and whenever she tried to start a conversation by asking me ""how i'd like to improve myself"" I just felt threatened really. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do if i can't figure myself out and I can't get myself to talk to a therapist. I'm tired of this stupid house and I'm tired of my family and I just wish i had the means to live completely by myself. or maybe just in a cave or something even. i just want to be alone and sleep forever.

I've never really fit in with anybody for a long time. Even when I was a kid i feel like i was too obnoxious and just annoying for anybody to really enjoy hanging out with me. Maybe when I was in kindergarten or first grade I was a really social butterfly and I wanted to be friends with everyone and I was really cute and everyone loved me. but by sixth grade I don't even know what happened. I got chubby and annoying and embarrassing. I just feel like i'm not what anybody expected. I was supposed to be this imaginative sweetheart kid and I was supposed to grow up and be someone great and instead i'm just this ugly mess that kind of took over and latched onto people like a parasite and no one's really known what to do with me since. I don't really know either. I have no skills or plans or anything and I'm not smart. I just wish that i'd never been born really. Or that i had become the person i was supposed to be instead of this thing. 

Whenever I have opened up to other people about how I feel (rarely) all i ever get is people just saying ""I'm valid"" like it means anything. It's just word garbage. I'm not a parking garage ticket or something.

Anyways I don't even know if anybody is really gonna read this thing because all it is is me feeling sorry for myself lmao. I dont even know what im doing anymore. I'm not good with reddit so this post will probably just get deleted or skmething",24Aug2020,1
316,I have school next week so I’m trying hard to not do anything but I feel like I shouldn’t be doing this. I’m ignoring all my problems and then breaking down when I’m by myself. My social anxiety and trust issues is stopping me from getting help. I feel like I should be hospitalized but I’ve heard too many bad things and I’m terrified. I don’t feel like a functioning member of society. I’m 13 and it’s been going on for years but now I forget what’s real or not. I’m attempting every few months and thinking of it daily.

319,"**\*Trigger warning for discussion of physical self-harm\***

Posting using my main because almost nobody irl knows me. I (F26) work at a small institution where there are few employees and lots of time is spent behind-the-scenes. Unfortunately this is a great environment for self-harming or having panic attacks and getting away with it. The first time I ever drew blood was last summer (at a different place) when I cut myself with an exacto knife. Now as my mental health has been spiralling I've started doing it at my new place of employment (again with exacto knives). I made four or five cuts just over a month ago and they are still slightly visible, though mostly healed over - none of them have ever stayed that long before. I also scraped myself with keys last Friday and the scars are still a little red. Sometimes I hit myself hard in the head/forehead too, with my hands or other objects like a metal water bottle. With the cutting, I never very hard/deep because I'm too scared, mostly I make shallow cuts and then either lightly trace over it again and again with the tip of the blade, or squeeze/pull the skin around it, until it bleeds a tiny bit. I always break off the pieces that I use to cut myself and put them away in the sharps disposal box so nobody gets my germs. I've never been caught and nobody has ever noticed or said anything.

I know this is wrong, it's messed-up to do it at a work place where I am supposed to be professional (especially when people, such as our summer students, could walk in on me and be feel unsafe). I'm constantly scared that I'm going to have a panic attack or just freak out at somebody at work - I already had a panic attack about 3 months ago and was found by another employee and given the day off for my mental health. I'm turning into a person that I'm not proud to be and am even a bit scared of. This is my first full-time, permanent position in a field that I love and I don't want to jeopardize it. I want to prove that I'm able to live on my own and have an occupation that means something. But I can't stop from hurting myself whenever I'm triggered by something because I feel like I deserve to be punished, or maybe it's a way of making myself a 'victim' for sympathy. 

And yes, I am seeing a therapist, but it's so hard when I feel like there are a million messages around me telling me that I don't deserve to be happy.",24Aug2020,1
322,"I’ve been feeling a little weird lately like I can’t figure out what’s wrong. It’s like I’m never happy anymore and I can’t even fake a smile. I use to be so good at faking a smile and I use to be happy when around my friend and family or when someone sent me a cute meme. But now it’s like nothing makes me happy, I’ll laugh if something is funny but then I’ll go right back to feeling weird. I don’t know what’s his feeling is, it’s not sad or happy or angry.

324,"So I’ve been grinding my teeth in my sleep to the point it wakes me up in the middle of the night. I have braces and can’t wear a mouth guard, and I’m pretty sure it’s due to anxiety and stress.

This week is a rough one for me. My birthday is in 3 days, but the stress comes from tomorrow. Tomorrow would’ve been my 1 year with my now-ex. It was the day he came to visit me for my birthday last year. We had dated and broken up like four months before that and it destroyed me. I had been praying for a sign those four months like “Please. Is he the one? Give me a sign? Am I wasting my time being heartbroken? Anything.” And that day, he calls me at 3am, I had just woken up from a nightmare, and goes “Hey, I’m outside your house”. Granted this wasn’t a two-hour drive. It was a ten-hour drive from my house to his. And he came without planning. He said “I just got in my car after work and said ‘I’m going to (my state) to visit you.” And I thought “Is this my sign? Are we meant to be?” That morning, we talked and he kissed me. We talked about getting back together. And he said he wanted to. So we did.

But now, a year later. We aren’t together. He left me almost a year after he left me the first time. And I know he never wants to be with me again. And I don’t want to be in a relationship where he left twice already. Because 1. I’ll live with the anxiety of him leaving again and 2. I will not allow myself to be in this pain a third time.

I love him. But I’m done trying to be with someone who stopped wanting to be with me twice. I wish I could just stop loving him. Like, I’ve moved on from wanting to be WITH him, but I haven’t moved on from knowing we’ll never be with each other again. If that makes sense, like, I know he’s gonna move on, but I feel like I’m gonna be jealous of her even though I know I deserve more happiness after everything I’ve done for him without wanting anything in return.

Like, he destroyed my mental health. Made me insecure and tried to be like “I never did that. I didn’t make you insecure”. But he did.

Anyway, all of that is causing my anxiety and stress. Because like, while I’m still fighting my way to be happy without him, he’s gonna find a girl and say the same things he said to me to her. “I’m the luckiest guy” “I wouldn’t have it any other way”. I wish I could rebound, but that’s not me. Even “oh if you set your intentions first and tell the person you’re not looking for anything”. That’s not me. I’m not okay with doing that. I don’t do hookups or flirt to feel better. I can only be into it and feel good if I like that person. Call me old fashioned but I date to marry.

I am in therapy, but it’s honestly not helping. I’m gonna try to find a primary doctor to see if I can get prescribed anxiety medication, but none of the doctors around me are taking new patients.

TL;DR: Tomorrow would’ve been my 1-year with my ex and the anxiety/stress of the memories is causing me to grind my teeth in my sleep.

Is there anything else I can do to help manage my anxiety and stress or stop the teeth grinding in my sleep? Any tips? And please don’t suggest meditation or journaling. I tried those but it made it worse.",24Aug2020,1
325,So I'm going to Arizona to meet my girlfriend of 2 years and she wants to get married when I get down there. We're only 20 and we've never met in person but have video chatted every night. I want to marry her too but I'm afraid her family will judge me or someone will object or I'll have an anxiety attack and I just need help. I'm also moving to California sometime and am dealing with my parents not wanting to give me access to my money. All this big stuff is happening and I guess I just need some emotional support through all this.

I have 2 people in my life who have been trying to help me for the longest time but they dont seem to understand that exercise won't delete the shit I've been through and when that doesn't work they only talk about medication this, medication that.
I've been on antidepressants before and last time I had horrible side effects and I don't want to risk getting the same side effects now that I live alone because that would end very badly.

But I'm just so lost right now and everything is stressing me out.
I'm starving myself, I sleep minimum of 16 hours and dont get out of bed until like 6pm, my OCD is driving me crazy when I'm awake so I end up taking anti-anxiety pills that just knocks me out most times, I can't even leave my apartment to get my mail, I want to selfharm again, my friends have completely dropped me because they are busy with their normal lives and I dont blame them.

I'm just not supposed to be here, I was dealt a shit hand right from the beginning and now I'm left here with nothing but shit.

329,"Hi. My best friend is showing several signs of depression (feeling bored/sad, nothing excites her anymore, no reactions to anything. She doesn't even get excited about our favorite artist posting on social media.) We have both known for at least several months now that she is depressed. I myself suffer from depression, so I know what she's going through. I currently see a therapist to work out some of my issues and I have mentioned to my best friend that she should talk with someone. She is afraid of several things; talking to someone about her problems, be on medication and the cost. I listen to the Crime Junkie podcast and one of their ads is for BetterHelp. They advertised it as being cheaper than seeing an actual therapist (from what I remember, anyway), so I suggested she look into it. She signed up and her estimation for sessions was $60-80 a week. She's not comfortable paying that amount of money which I totally understand. It's a lot. I've actually considered sending her money to make it more affordable for her because I know her mental health is important. 

As of today, I don't know if she's going to move forward with seeing a therapist via BetterHelp. So to help her, I'm reaching out on reddit to see if anyone here has some suggestions on how I can find her the help she needs and to continue being supportive of her journey. 

I'd love any ideas provided. Some ideas I have rolling around in my head; Foods that she can eat to improve her mood, exercises (such as yoga or meditation), podcasts she can listen to, etc. I'm not sure if this is a thing, but is there a search engine that lets you find a therapist within your price range?? We're in the DMV area of the US, if anyone needs to know.

331,"My depression has gotten so out of control now that I can’t even be around people. I’m only even slightly content when I’m alone. Strangely I strive to have friends and my partner but when it actually comes to it, I’m like a robot? 

My partner and I have been together 8 years but we don’t live together. I can feel him getting bored of me lately. I don’t blame him. He comes over, we watch tv, and during so, I don’t like him asking any questions, making any comments, nothing. I don’t like him sitting next to me on the couch. When he says something to be funny, I can’t even fake smile. I’m just so miserable and I try my hardest to not put it on him but I’m irritable around people. It’s only when he’s about to leave that I panic and feel like I need to put on an act and act all nice so he doesn’t leave upset with me. When he leaves, I cry over how miserable I am. Wtf am I going to do?! I can only be around my son and that’s it, which is probably because the mothering bond is so strong in most of us women. 

I’m so miserable that I get a nice feeling when I think, “it’s ok, you’ve always got suicide as an option to not feel this anymore”. I feel calm when I think of suicide. Almost like I have a way out of this. 

Then the weirdest thing ever....My son the other day was talking to me and out of nowhere he says, “oh man if you ever died and you died by like...killing yourself or something, I would just follow you and kill myself too because I would be too sad without you”. 
That hit me like a ton of bricks. I realised in that moment that my only way out was gone. I couldn’t do that to my son. The horrible part of it all is, I feel depressed that I can’t! Jesus, I’ve never been so ill before. Give me a broken bone, a burn, whatever, but the worst, most sickening, soul destroying, pain one can feel, is depression. Deep, deep, rock bottom, depression. 
So in summary; my friends have all ditched or replaced me (even though I was there for them massively during their rough times), I can’t feel happiness, I feel miserable around other people, my partner probably resents me and wishes he was with someone else and I can’t kill myself because I know it would break the love of my life’s heart aka my son.

Every single morning, I wake up and I'm up for about an hour before this tidal wave of depression hits me. Then, I can't feel anything at all. It goes from being incredibly sad, to just endless numbness and misery. I've had a lot of suicidal thoughts, to the point where my consciousness doesn't even react to them anymore. Those thoughts are treated the same, like the thought process of opening a door knob or something. I've spoken to my mother, who is a very caring person, about my problems, and she said she would try to get me therapy, but she won't do it now and I don't know why after multiple attempts to facilitate the conversation with her about it. At this point, I'm seriously considering ending it all just to put an end to these feelings. This is pretty much my last effort to get help, I've tried everything else short of therapy, which I cannot obtain as I have no job to fund it myself, or a car to get there.

334,"I was about 13 at the time and someone i followed linked to an account asking people to report it without specifying what exactly it was about. when i clicked it was a bunch of videos of very young children in a variety of sexual situations. one was even a baby. for months afterwards i constantly felt dirty because i'd seen it and was also scared that i'd get arrested since a friend of mine got arrested for producing child porn because she took and sent her own nudes and three people who had the nudes were also arrested.

so clearly at this point i'm not going to get arrested for it so i'm not scared about that, but still occasionally i have these intrusive thoughts where i remember those images and videos and i really worry about those kids and if they ever got out of that situation or if they're still being abused.

i get so scared to bring it up to anyone, even my therapist, because i don't want anyone to assume i'm a pedophile or that i intentionally searched for that. and it would be kind of admitting to a crime i guess which also makes me scared.

335,"I am now 23, my first relationship started when I was 14 and ended when I was 17. 

I am still coming to terms with it. I'm re-establishing, everyday, just how hypersensitive I am. I think this relationship has had a profound effect on the rest of my life this far. I wish all these thoughts would go away. 

It was generally a very positive relationship until towards the end. We were very in love, even until the end I believe. 

He started to get frustrated with the lack of sex. I had a sexual disorder which prevented us from having penetrative sex, we tried once or twice but it didn't work. We would do other things but clearly not enough. I would wake in my sleep to him wanking himself off with my hand, or touching me. This is something I never mentioned until months later in the midst of an argument. He later cheated on me with my best friend, I never got the full story as both of them had different recollections so I didn't think I could believe either one. 

After the thing with my best friend, I stupidly tried to repair the relationship, over the friendship. I regret this even now. That relationship meant the world to me. We saw eachother almost everyday for almost 3 years. When it ended I didn't know what do with myself. We stayed together for a few months after and then I finally couldn't take it anymore. I also found some sexual messages he was sharing with another girl. 

After we split, some of his friends would taunt me. There were misunderstandings. I would talk to my friends generally about relationships and sex. I still had a sex life with him, even though we never had PIV sex. Rumours spread and these boys decided that I was a liar and a bitch because I was ""telling everyone I had sex with him when I didn't"". 
I was labelled as frigid and a slut at the same time, a bitch and a liar. They would sit behind me in assembly and whisper abuse in my ear. One of them confronted me at the college/sixth form leaving party. He said my sex life was his business and I was successfully intimidated by him. 
Somehow I was made out to be the bad guy in our relationship. ""How could you do that to ___ ?"" ""How could you lie? How could you be such a bitch?"". 

My nightmares go along these lines. I also think about these things, unwillingly, when I'm trying to sleep. 

School was a traumatic time for me separately from this anyway, it was undoubtedly the worst and the most memorable. 

I still believe he was, generally, a good guy. I don't have hard feelings towards him, but his friends were awful. He never attempted to control them, I don't even know if he knew what they did to me. Everyday I went to school I felt this tension, like so many people hated me, as they did seem to. I'm so glad that time of my life is over, but I wish I could get away from it. 

It has affected my self worth, my presence in relationships, my trust in people, my assumptions. 

I would like to move on.

If you have read this far, thank you. I am very welcoming to advice but I guess it's hard to give advice in such a situation. 

I wish you all luck and love in your individual, complex situations that you find yourself in. Thank you",24Aug2020,1

I really hate the feeling of isolation, not just isolation, it's empty isolation.

i still go to work, i still have my ""friends"", i still try to socialize and participate in life, but i really hate it.

i hate work, though i have a decent position, (I'm a team lead), i have decent friends that i talk to and joke with regularly, and i have family that i've lived with for 2 decades. but none of it is fulfilling, it just doesn't feel like happiness,

it feels more like stale existence, which is very bland, like cereal without milk &amp; sugar; or like eating a raw potato

it sucks so much, i don't really know how to handle it in a healthy way

-----

on another sh**ty note,   
i like one of my coworkers in a personal way, no idea what to do, though i'm pretty sure i shouldn't do anything to try to progress it,   
I'm transgender, MTF.   
i constantly fear disappointing people just by being myself.   
that disappointment is not something i want to face.

the one thing i've done to try to at least be friends with him is to not hide behind a false personality...   
normally i put on a false persona of being an asinine asshole without any human connection, but with him, i feel slightly connected. i barely know him yet i feel as though i can trust him,   
it's quite strange as he is the only person i've met in the past 5-7 years that i have felt this way with

-----

idk though, maybe I'm just delusional   
Maybe I'm lost inside my own head,   
Maybe my life really is just a simple shitstorm and false emotions are my way of coping

339,"I'm normally happy and make mistakes. the little mistakes that can be fixed easily. i laugh it off and I'm not serious about it and my friends look at me like""he is grumpy"" or ""he is careless"" and they would be right about that. I'm careless about everything around me but lately I'm making chooses that make no sense or different from what they think. my brother in law would think thati would follow his rules and he is wrong because he loses. it's checkmate for him. it's a lose on him because he can't understand me or his wife or son. me and my cousin act like brothers. we knew each other since we was little but never hung out with each other. yeah we fight alot but we are guys and we get that over quickly. when my brother in law scolded him for some reason (something small that it's easy to fix) and my sister stop bro in law from making it worst. she said to me""make Andrew feel better"" and i did by hugging him. he is still my cousin but he looks up to me as a big brother and I'm ok with that. he feels comfortable around me well we mess around and sometimes we blame each other but he is 15 and i know that he will see life differently then me. I'm doing this for him and I'm two years older than him but I'm teaching him how to protect himself. his dad won't and no one really sees his issues but they are shown on his arms. I'm sorry for him alot and I'm helping him deal with his identity. i been where he is. a bad dad(my dad never cared for me) and a toxic house. it's not shown at first but when there is no guess it turns in to hell for us(me and my cousin). nothing but scolded and mental break downs. there has always been a different from how we learn things. my dad hit me and my butt would hurt so much. i never felt like a son but more like a toy. Andrew is ok but he is suffering and hiding the fact that no one else can read him.

the mistakes i made that was little was a joke or nothing special because i am nothing. no matter how much i try for my friends or family it's nothing to them. i told my friend""I'm scared of being alone"" she knows that she is hurting as well. i want to help her out before helping myself. i don't care about what say to people in general but I'm that I'm going to die and disappoint them around me. i am happy hiding my pain and scars but sometimes my mask slips off and my real personally shows and it's not pretty. i let some of my friends see the real me (mentally scared and messed up) and they like me for who i am. i try to run away from my past but it haunts me still by flashing in lights. when i was patching something up i stabbed myself with the needle and it stabbed me on my finger lightly but when it did i saw flashing lights like from a hospital. i never thought of that day because i was blanking in and out of living and dying. 


i never told anyone about this and I'm saying it here. i don't want my friends to see this scared side of me. I'm so scared because i end up dying inside the nightmare. (╥﹏╥)",24Aug2020,1
340,"I had my first class today, when I was walking to class, I tried to get back into my old mindset, but it didn’t seem like it was working right. I saw some birds and animals, and knew I was interested in them, but I just couldn’t feel it right. Like I knew they were something I liked, but this wrong feeling creeped into my head. I tried to reach out to my old self, but it didn’t feel right. I tried to think about my comic characters or animals or videogames while walking to class, but that “off” feeling continued. That feeling like I was not myself anymore. I tried thinking about my old crush, but I couldn’t really feel the emotion right anymore. I tried to think about the heavier plot points in my comics, but my emotions felt… not right. I got no enjoyment out of it. Intrusive thoughts, feelings, and questions kept ruining it. I feel like I lost what it meant to be human, like I’m just going through the motions of myself, reminding myself what I need to say and do, how to act and react to things, even when alone. I have memories of what it was like to feel things, but it seems as though I don’t know if I am anymore. 

During the class, I felt myself getting into it, almost forgetting this… not right feeling. I still felt… off, but less so. I tried fantasizing but it feels more like I’m remembering past fantasies and not actually engaging with them.

 Everything feels like a distant memory now, like I’m not myself anymore. Things that used to come naturally don’t anymore, my sense of humor is not right, I feel like I’m questioning and disconnected from everything. I keep getting thoughts about sexual and violent stuff, like “what is appropriate and what isn’t, what was I into before and what wasn’t I into before? Why did I lose that? If I am capable of thinking such horrible things or seeing such horrible things without feeling bad, do I deserve to feel good?” I don’t know if I’m explaining this right, but this is what I’m going through. 

My mom did say I was punishing myself, and I do agree with her. I think this is probably the result of depression that got WAY out of hand due to panicked googling and unneeded introspection. The problem now seems to be that I threw away too much of myself and I don’t know who I am anymore. I feel broken. I feel like my memories are all I have: good memories, bad memories, intense memories and light memories. Memories of reality and memories of past fantasies. But when I look into these memories, I insert myself with my current mind-state, which makes everything feel worse. I keep seeing the worst of myself, and it’s so corrupted by intrusive thoughts I barely recognize it anymore. I have this fear of giving into myself, but I also have a fear of letting go of myself. 

My therapist says all this soul searching is a waste of time and that “I” will come back with time if I just leave all this pontificating alone. The problem is that all I’ve ever done is pontificate. I pontificated on all sorts of things, and it was never really that much of a problem for me. But now it feels like my usual coping strategies are gone. What’s worse is that the “original problem” I wanted to solve seems to be the thing least changed. The darker perverted side of myself seems alive and well while everything else is damaged almost beyond recognition. I did this all to myself and I don’t know how to undo it. There’s a side of me that thinks that if I’m capable of doing this much damage to myself, I don’t deserve to be fixed. There’s another side of me that thinks I was always like this, just below the surface. But I don’t want to accept that. If only I could just forget everything about what I did to myself from googling and the introspection. 

I lost my good happy side that got excited by things because I wanted to get rid of the darker side of myself, not knowing that they were linked. Is this who I am now? Just the dark side of myself? I feel like that’s all that’s left of me sometimes, and it too has been corrupted by intrusive thoughts. If I am capable of going to such a dark place in my mind, do I deserve to feel good, to enjoy things? I just want to go back to before I did this to myself, when I knew who I was, when I knew what I was. When I felt attached to the world. Now I don’t even remember what that feels like. I’m full of weird urges and feelings and I don’t know what I want anymore. I’m scaring myself a lot. I used to be fine with the dark stuff I was into, and I had it mostly under control. I didn’t question when I liked an action scene or laughed at a funny video where someone got hurt or a Monty Python sketch where everyone dies or whatever. I didn’t question when I watched nature documentaries or dinosaur movies where predator prey interaction took place. I didn’t question myself when playing a videogame where I fight enemies or competing with my friends. I didn’t question myself when I joked around with my friends. I didn’t question the more chaotic DND characters I’ve made. I didn’t question the sad or dark or intense parts of the comics I wrote (in my head). I knew what made me excited and what made me sad, sometimes I felt a mix of things. But now everything makes me feel messed up, or I look at the world and it seems messed up. I read way too deeply into myself and made connections that might not have been there and now I can’t get back. I hate this. I feel like I have to find myself but I can’t go looking for myself or I’ll lose myself even more. 

I’m sorry for the constant posting. I’m sure that there are plenty of people on here with ACTUAL VALID mental health problems that aren’t their own fault.",24Aug2020,1
341,"It happened about an hour ago.

I was having a conversation with my dad and we were talking about how social studies and history are the same thing. He ended up proving me that I was wrong. I knew I was wrong but I played it off like I was correct. Why? Because I felt horrible I felt like I had embassed myself in front of millions of people or on national television.
Or like how I was handling my infant niece a little bit ago. I was spinning her around little bit and my mom told me to stop doing that or it would make her dizzy. I felt the same way. Fucking horrible. I don't know why. I just do. Any support?",24Aug2020,1
