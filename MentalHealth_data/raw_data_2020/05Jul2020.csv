1,"I was a cyber-mob victim in February of 2019. I was 23/m. 

I was terribly bullied, humiliated and ridiculed by hundreds of people. Name calling, hate speech, threats and insults. 

I have since dealt with severe depression and disturbing suicidal thoughts and fantasies and I am 25/m later this month. 

If they were male, I don't give a fuck. Even If they are female, if they were either underage, elderly, overweight or black or had several large tattoos or piercings they are fine and also have nothing to worry about they're not a psychological threat to me.  

But if them bitches bullying me were white/caucasian, highly attractive females and without any tattoos or piercings, 18+, I'd wanna threaten them, scare them and terrorize them! 

I'd suffering delusions and beyond sickening fantasies of wanting to cause physical harm to these particular women.  

Why? Because My Sexuality was shattered, and the quality of my life had dropped exponentially to the point I fantasize suicide everyday. 

In return for causing unpleasant, and severe psychological harm on me, I suffer extreme fantasies of wanting to hurt them. Worse, the fantasies can even reach such extreme extents of, wanting to more than just harm them, but could also include thoughts of killing them! 

It is actually extremely common for people who are bully victims to seek revenge look it up!! 

I want them cunts brought to justice for the pain and gried they have inflected me for the past 16 months.  

the male people participating in the bullying did not commit the crime of destroying my sexuality. The same is said for any girl who is under the age of 18, who is elderly, black, overweight or physically handicapped is not at risk. even if these women had participated they are not a threat to me and they didn't destroy my sexuality so they have committed no crime to me. 

I need extreme psychiatric treatment.",05Jul2020,2

3,"hi! so, i’ve had this issue for a while but it’s recently gotten worse, so i thought i’d try to get some answers. 

sometimes i get very overwhelmed- like it feels like everything is just too much. like i can’t be in the same room as people eating anymore because the noises that they make upset me so much, we have glass cups that i can’t touch because the texture makes me so uncomfortable, and when people touch me too much or talk to me for too long i freak out. 

like, the other day, i was on my mom’s bed in her room (im 15f, btw) talking to her, and then my little sister came in and laid on the bed next to me, and then the dog jumped onto the bed, and they were all talking to me and i was just trying to read the article on my phone, and my sister kept brushing against me, and then the dog kinda sniffed me, and then i just yelled “stop!” threw myself off the bed, and then kinda squatted on the ground, closed my eyes, and plugged my ears. i had to stay like that for like fifteen seconds, which seems like a long time when your family is staring at you in a shocked silence lol

also, whenever im with people for too long and they talk too much at me, i cant handle it and start snapping at people. 

like, ive had to leave classes to go sit in the bathroom to calm myself down because it was too loud. it got to the point where, by the end of the school year, i preferred to eat lunch in the bathroom. 

im more on the extrovert side, so i just find it strange that i cant handle people anymore. 

i looked it up, and it sounds a lot like sensory overload. i was just wondering if you all agreed with that? ive never been diagnosed with anything, though my parents suspect that i have adhd and a VERY mild case of ocd. i also thought that i had/have depression or anxiety, but never told anyone. im not trying to self-diagnose, i just thought that that might be helpful information!

thank you so much! i hope you all have a great day, and remember to drink water!",05Jul2020,2
5,"I live in a super rural area and have been home from college since March due to Covid. I’m stressing about going back to campus in the fall since a bar on campus was linked last week to almost 200 positive Covid cases. 

Most recently, my cousin was at a bonfire with a kid whose mom and uncle tested positive. I had been with my cousin twice since he had been around that kid and got his results back from his test today and they were negative. Since then, I’ve been super nervous, especially since we luckily haven’t had many Covid cases in my home county. My younger brother is at a bonfire tonight and it makes me feel very uncomfortable that my parents are allowing him to hang out with large groups of his friends, knowing a kid a year older than them has been exposed. My parents don’t say too much and even if they tell him to stay home, he’ll complain about it and they’ll let him go. It makes me want to go back to my apartment and quarantine myself there alone and never leave there.",05Jul2020,1
7,"Hey everyone, I hope you're all well. (Im sorry if this doesn't make sense, I've tried this so many times before without having the guts to hit post.)  
I'm a 21 y/o male, a few years ago (when I was 18) my whole life changed. I got broken up with which I took horribly, lost all my so-called friends, my job all in my last year of school. Which, in turn, fucked over my studies and I finished with some less-than-adequate results.  
I took this on the chin, started hanging with a new group of people I met at school (completely different, these guys were the best. I would have considered them my family (in a way I still do)). I started to feel this ""empty-happy"" where I knew I was supposed to be happy but I just didn't know how to feel it or express it to others. So we would party, a lot. go to bars, clubs, pubs and have some pretty insane nights out. Still didn't feel totally convinced on my happiness, but it felt like life had started to get more steady. 

Without much warning, my friends wanted to stop hanging out and stopped inviting me round because I would ""bring down the mood"". Two weeks after my best-doggo friend passed away, this hurts the most and im a fucking mess because I haven't had anyone to talk to about it -  I either bring their mood down or do something else to screw it all. I literally was handed a second chance on a silver platter and I blew it. It has been 3 years since then and nothing has changed. I still haven't spoken to many people (outside work), all relationships seem like a waste of time because it all ends in the same way, And I break down in tears almost every day because I miss my little squish so god damn much and I wish there was a way i could have her back for 5 more seconds. But there isnt.

My thoughts have started to get so dark, it really terrifies me to the point I can't eat or sleep. The one thing I have always been scared of is being alone and yet I can't stop thinking about how once my old man leaves this world, I will be totally alone. Just a sad, alone, pathetic excuse for a man.  
again im so very sorry if this doesnt make sense or if im just being a downer, I know this is a safe place to talk about these things but I've been so hesitant because the last thing I want is to make anyone sad. I just needed to speak my mind.  
I'm going to lie down for a moment, writing this took it out of me a bit. Have a wonderful evening/night x",05Jul2020,1
8,"Hi, it’s my first post here! I am kinda desperate right now, so I’m positing this for anyone to comment with any help, tips, resources, anything. I am a in a relationship and I mean at the moment it’s pretty toxic. I won’t say it’s all him because I know it’s me too. He has his toxicity for reasons that I won’t say on here because  it’s not my place. But I want to work on my own because I want to make this work. But honestly it starts with my head. I am insanely jealous. It’s not a normal bit of jealousy, it’s actually consuming me. I’m paranoid over it I’m stressed and worried 247. I’m a suck person. And I say this based on the toxic shitty stuff I did, deleting girls and monitoring stuff 247. It’s so bad, these girls are people he grew up with old best friends. Guys can have girl best friends but mine apparently can’t, because if my messed up head. And lately I mean we have been fighting over other stuff, and he threatens to cheat on me and he says that when he is mad to upset me, but saying that even if it’s not true is just adding fuel to the fire. So basically I need help. I don’t know what to do or how to get better from this. It’s to the point that we’ll I know I won’t hurt myself but I think about it because how can one live like this. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",05Jul2020,0
9,"I'm diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADHD combined type so it could be because of those or just because I'm weird but I was wondering if it was anything anyone else does because I feel like it makes me look weird or childish to act this way but it's hard to not act this way. I sit in cubby holes like closets, cupboards, and any little alcove I can find. I also enjoy wearing ear plugs because when everything around me is muffled I don't feel as lost and like I'm just a ghost walking around--I feel grounded and engaged instead of my head being in the clouds. I have a shake I do with my head like a twitch, and I like sucking/chewing on things that have the texture of gel pencil grips. Speaking of textures, I have to touch good textures after I touch a bad one. I hope this makes sense I'm sorry if it doesn't I can't connect my thoughts into words well ❤️",05Jul2020,3
10,"It seems like there are so many conflicting schools of what causes what, or what you need to be XYZ, what’s good for you, what’s bad. 

I feel like a lot of these are just concepts that make enough sense to adopt, then they become our reality.  In the same way that our identities and personalities are always morphing based off of our own narratives.",05Jul2020,1
11,"Like when people are upset about being overweight or anything to do with eating disorders or body image. It makes my amygdala light up like a fucking Christmas tree and I don’t even have an eating disorder that gets triggered or anything. It’s like the one things I can’t stand to talk or hear about, and seeing as my Gf actually does have a severe eating disorder and needs my support, I need to get over this and preferably quickly.

I just don’t know what my problem is. It scares me to the point of dissociation or hyper vigilance. I usually cannot speak or respond at all if she’s upset about her weight. And if she compares her body to mine especially. It makes me freak out and although I’m not mad at her it makes me sound pissed off and defensive if I open my mouth at all. 

The only things I can think of that could’ve caused this are:

1. My mom was hospitalized for anorexia growing up, and has been a calorie counter to the point of obsession my entire life. Has controlled what I ate until late highschool when I realized I can actually just buy whatever I want and eat it behind her back. I have always had a voracious appetite, especially in highschool when I started stress eating. My mom starting cracking down on portion control and what I should and shouldn’t eat. I think she even was on the verge of confronting me about possibly being pregnant lol. Just a lot of my mom subtly trying to control my weight and diet without outright telling me. I didn’t realize how much I wasn’t allowed to eat or was criticized for eating until I moved out.

2. During a hard time any talk of self hate, especially body hate was usually immediately followed with self harm right in front of me. Or vivid suicidal thoughts.

3. I have been on the chunkier side. I took an anti psychotic for about two months that made me drop around 11 pounds. I always thought I wanted to be skinnier and despised it. Everyone was in my business constantly and touching me and I hated it. I ate a fuck ton of junk food and quit the medicine (for other reasons too) to gain the weight back. I was also afraid of weighing less than my gf and possibly triggering her eating disorder. 

4. The concept of starving to death or starving in general scares the fuck out of me. Ive worked with old folks and had pets shrivel up before me so I associate being very underweight with being on deaths door. It’s like the marker of death for me. 

5. I was also cripplingly afraid of vomit and vomiting for most of my life. And while I’ve managed to overcome this fear almost entirely and completely by myself, I still couldn’t make myself vomit even if I tried. I feel like maybe part of this phobia sticks to me in the way that an eating disorder or speaking about weight could cause it to flare up in the deeper parts of my brain.

Sorry if this sounds really dumb and my points sound irrelevant. I think they sound really irrelevant and I feel like I’m just being a pussy around a topic that makes me uncomfortable. I’d appreciate any advice at all. Thank you so much.",05Jul2020,2
12,"Just a year ago, I had no grounding for mental health issues. Like I knew people with mental health struggles and friends who went to therapy, and I sympathised. But that was the best I could do at the time and I didn't really understand the battle. I supported from the sidelines but couldn't help fight in the fray.

Fast forward to now - I've not been diagnosed with anything but I am quite sure I have some mental health issue. It's like something you can't control, but on the face of it it seems like you should be able to control it because it's you, and logically you're the only one in control of yourself. I've lost motivation for everything that I've been interested in (dancing, baking, exercising, socialising, studying maths and physics) and studies have suffered as a result. It's like I can't concentrate on anything and I can't remember anything. I can't sleep and I can't seem to have the self-discipline to do the things I want to do. I think that I've been thinking about the bad aspects of life more often in my free time; that or the little things in life affect me a lot more emotionally. Every time I do make it out of the slump, it's only temporary and I get pulled back in. I'm worried that I'll forget who I once was or that I'll never get back to being that person. It's so weird to think how far I've fallen and how different I used to be.

Rant over. Anyway, I've done minimalistic research into anxiety and I'm still not entirely sure what it is. Like what are some symptoms that exemplify characteristics of it (i.e. how can you tell if you have it)?",05Jul2020,1

16,"Recently I (17M) have been feeling down, and this is because I don't really know who I am anymore. I used to know what made me happy in life and I had goals that I would aim towards.

But now I don't know, the motivation I had isn't there anymore with the exception of spermatic bursts of motivation for my spare time (trading card games)

I want to be able to sit down and talk through my feelings, even if just to myself. But doing that feels impossible because I immediately get overwhelmed with emotions. As if just thinking about who I am results in my mind defending itself by scaring me into distracting myself and when I confronted those feelings recently they made me scared to go to sleep.

I don't know what to do, as I haven't had anything like this before but I have had these deep routed feelings for a few months now and probably started 2 years ago

When I force myself to do one of them, I really don’t enjoy it or my head gets flooded with thoughts of this will be too hard, why did you start this late, what’s the point, you’re not that good, imagine where you would be if you started four years ago. I don’t know if I should keep trying or officially give up. If I don’t even like it then why am I doing it. All of those things I did have interests in at one point but now it’s such a burden.

I am a 16 year old female who has been in and out of therapy for a few years. I have self-harmed in the past which lead me to getting therapy. In my life the ever present feeling of anxiety has nearly always been there and the dark blanket that is depression followed suit after my fathers passing. However up until recently those have been the only indicators of mental illness in me so far.

In the past few weeks my anxiety has begun to morph into paranoia, severe paranoia. I cannot sleep without a light on anymore because I feel like the shadows created by my cable boxes are people watching me. I’m pretty sure I’ve also begun to experience auditory and visual hallucinations as well which is getting increasingly more scary as they drive me into panic attacks.

I just started seeing a new therapist who isn’t technically a therapist but more like an assistant or whatever. I had my virtual intake appointment tuesday and this upcoming tuesday is an appointment. 

My family has a history of mental illness so I feel like she will take me a bit more seriously when I tell her my symptoms but I don’t know how to go about informing her... The paranoia has been driving me insane and it’s becoming so much harder to fall asleep when I feel like invisible eyes are watching me. It also doesn’t help that any shadow I see nearly gives me a panic attack. 

How do I go about informing her of my symptoms? I feel lost in what I should do and writing this is getting my mind off the sounds i’m hearing but I know that won’t last long...",05Jul2020,1

After worrying about it for a week, I went to the doctor and it's only when I looked for a second doctor appointment that they realized what was going on in my lungs. I got an infection at quite possibly the worst time possible. It's not covid-19 but it's so devastating.   


Everyday, I don't know what I'm living for. I went from wondering what I'll be doing in the next 20 years to wondering if I'll get to see tomorrow. I feel like there's no reason to fight on.

Recently my boyfriend has just completely been distant, we usually text daily and try to call everyday. We haven’t called in about 2 weeks now, I don’t want to be clingy. It’s apparently because of badly timed schedules, after weeks of having my schedule finally fixed, (as someone who really struggles to fall asleep) going to sleep at 11, I decided I’d stay up, I just want to talk to him, he’s the only person who loves me. I made it really obvious I’m awake, ive talked in GCs that we are in together etc. I was hoping he would ask to call.. I didn’t want to ask because everytime I’ve asked recently he’s just decided to game instead, or said yes then just not called. He hasn’t asked, instead he’s talking to his female friend. Before we were together he told me, and I quote ‘she’s prettier, funnier, older, smarter and better.’ It was half jokingly but I could sense there was some truth behind it- well because it is true. I’m ugly and stupid. Well I ignored it as best I could all this time we’ve been together but now I’m torn. I messed up my perfect sleeping schedule to be rejected again, and for the better, prettier, smarter girl. I can’t take this, he doesn’t love me anymore. I can’t even bring it up to him or I’ll be clingy or obsessive. And it’s not like I can tell him he’s the only person who loves me and without him i’d kill myself, that’s just wrong. I’m so lonely right now, a long time ago I admitted I cry myself to sleep to him and he swore he would always help me when I can’t sleep. Now I have to cry at 2:56am to myself, and vent on reddit because I seriously have no one left. I hate myself so much. I wish I just wasn’t so ugly, I’m so disgusting to look at no wonder he started hating me. He’s been making more and more fat jokes recently too..

I avoid places or events which the language is spoken so that leads me to a hermit’s life in China... it is almost the same in Taiwan but I feel free because China banned almost everything... fb, YouTube, Pinterest, Instagram, Reddit,discord... my life... so they are all brainwashed by Baidu.com

By the way, I went to an international school so English is my first language, (um, I do everything with it) I could not write Chinese until I was 10yrs old and even now... I can’t pronounce some words like the natives could but the rest is completely like a native.

31,"Fuck, I feel depressed. I have these two people inside of my head. The one that thinks and the one that feels. The one thst thinks is, and has been for the last few months, trying to keep me busy. Busy with workouts, fun, books, work, pet, literally anything that can hold my attention and keeps me away from looking inside of me. Inside of my head and what I'm feeling. I going from A to B to C, constantly trying to escape the awkward conversations in my mind, that I am lonely, that I miss so and so, that I am jealous, or that I have envy, or that I'm unfulfilled, etc, etc...


This isn't even about a person in particular, unless that person is me. Am  I always going to plod miserably from one relationship to the next, feeling awful up until I meet someone amazing, and then I will of course load that relationship with all the negativity that I've carried, and which keeps growing because that stuff builds up, and eventually the relationship will break. Thus, I'll find myself back into the hamster wheel, chasing and feeling miserable until the cycle takes its course infinite times. 


I have tried in so many ways to centre my life. To feel purpose on its own. I have gotten my dream job. Worked hard for it, and gotten it, despite the fact that I distracted by all this shit. I have focused on becoming fit and overcoming some long time body shame that I had. I have focused on friends, reconnecting, bonding, getting out of my comfort zone, meeting new people. I have focused on cultivating hobbies. I read six books this year. I've started to learn a new language, I've mediated for a while. I cut down on drink, and drugs happened sporadically and never out of expected controlled times. Meaning, Monday mornings I forced myself to be back at it, at my home office no matter what had happened. 


I have in so many ways tried to get a hold of my life, soothe my feelings, and tried to make myself feel at ease in my own skin, and yet I still feel shit. After so many months nursing my sadness; sadness from being broken up with, sadness from rejection, sadness from the lost intimacy and the hopes and dreams; after so many months, I really thought I would have respite from it all. I thought my thinking brain would turn to my feeling brain and say, look you're in better shape now, let's let you be part of the conversation again. 


But no, whenever thinking brain looks, feeling brain is feeling rubbish.. And it makes thinking brain mad, because ""why on earth would you be sad!? What right do you even have? After so many months... After doing all these things... After all the great things going for you... Why do you even feel like that? How dare you... Fuck out of here and don't come back until you've sorted your shit out."" and the thing is that it will probably never be sorted. I will go from one relationship to the other, carrying this shit over, and feeling rubbish in between. I am sick of it. ",05Jul2020,1
32,"The problem is simple. I have all these ideas of how I want to live, but all of them are forgetting that the root cause of my misery is that my life fundamentally sucks because I lack the basic things that make life bearable. Family I feel close to and comfortable with? Nope. A partner? Nope. A job that puts me in a competence hierarchy and give me a place in the world and something to work at/for? Nope. Literally any friends at all? Nada. 

Luckily I’m not on drugs. If I took drugs or alcohol, I probably would have died a long time ago. 

The problem is that my life sucks. 

I’m not one of those people who has everything in their life in order and they still hate themselves and want to die. I’m just someone who’s life sucks. 

But I don’t know how to get myself to fix it. Obviously I can’t afford to keep suffering. I only have one life and I need to put it together or else I will go to the great nothing I came from before I was born. 

However, I am currently more afraid of trying to live than no living. The reason is simple: the unknown is scarier than the known. I know exactly where I will end up if I do nothing. I will be miserable beyond belief, and will probably fall so far into the pits of despair that I will actually take my life. But I don’t fear death. I know exactly what death is like. It is just like how it was before you were born.

What I fear is getting a job. What I fear is making friendship. What I fear is falling in love. Because I don’t know these things.

Misery is comforting because it is the most familiar thing in my 22 years of suffering.

I think I am completely insane at this point.",05Jul2020,1
33,Not much to say but what do you do when you have a bad anxiety attack? It’s like I have this fear but I don’t want to admit it. Some kind of enhanced awareness. I hate the attention and I try to hide it but it’s too hard. I don’t even like going outside anymore. I just want to be alone where no one can be around. I don’t feel comfortable being around people. I feel like I can’t live functionally in society. I have a terrible minset. It’s hard for me to ask for help. I can’t even help myself at times.,05Jul2020,1
34,"I'm not expecting sympathy or anything because I'm the bad guy in this story, I just don't know how to cope with what I did.

It's been 2 years since I cheated on my boyfriend. He was my highschool sweetheart, &amp; we'd been together for about 2 years. I went to college &amp; met a nice older guy in 1 of my classes, &amp; we hit it off. I told my boyfriend I wanted to ""take a break"" because I was ""too busy with college right now"", then started hooking up with my classmate. I wasn't interested in dating him, I just wanted a ""friend with benefits"", but the classmate thought we were in a relationship now. When classes ended, I broke up with him because ""I have depression and need to work on myself"". Then, I got back together with my ex. I told him the entire real truth beforehand, and he just... forgave me. instantly. he was so sweet and understanding. which made me feel even worse.

we broke up a few months later but are still great friends. i haven't spoken to or seen the classmate since. but i'm constantly haunted by the entire experience. at the time, i was 19 &amp; thought i was a badass adult for having casual sex with an older guy. but now, i feel sick. i feel sick for lying, most of all, &amp; i lied to everyone. i see my classmate's face everywhere, i'm constantly reminded of him &amp; of what i did. i will NEVER reach out to him to apologize because i'm honestly too terrified and would throw up if i ever actually heard from him again. i'm sickened to my core at who i was &amp; how i acted, and I NEVER FACED ANY CONSEQUENCES FOR IT. NOBODY WAS MAD AT ME, EXCEPT FOR MYSELF. how can i get closure, if i'm the only one who still can't let it go? if everyone else has already moved on?",05Jul2020,1
35,"I made a whole list in my notes but its so long no one would read it so let me narrow it down to the basics: 

rules she has for me/family PRE-corona i need to mention this all has been going on for YEARS:

-no pooping in bathroom more than once a day
- no shaving with baby oil even though regular shaving cream irritates my legs EVEN if i clean the whole shower afterward (today i shaved with her stupid shaving cream and she screamed over a single leg hair i kid you not i looked it was 1 leg hair like???) 
- parents have to shower immediately after hugging her or she harasses them bc she’s “dirty” and now theyre “dirty” even though she showers twice a day sometimes 3 times 
- if i go to a public place or even get in my car (dont even use a public bathroom) i can’t use toilet until after i shower even if i showered that day already 
- shes notorious for washing her clothes or drying them then leavinf them in for hours and refuses to move them and then if anyone in family tries to move it because we need to do laundry too will throw tantrum and rewash everything 
- goes in my room and takes brand new UNUSED washed towels and rewashes them because the dresser i put them on is “dirty” (i now hide towels but ahe usuallt will tear apart my whole room to find them so its pointless)
- i said how about i have 2-3 towels for me and just wash them myself and keep them in my room( we literally have so many body towels from over the years that my PARENTS bought) she said absolutely not.. i said i can take the towel colors you dont like. still said no
- she spends an hour - an hour and 15 minutes in shower 2-3 times a day ive timed it just for the heck of it 


what makes no sense: she had no issue kissing or having sex with her boyfriend and has even drank after him out of same cup. he is very unsanitary compared to the average human being based off what she told us. eventually she “broke up with him” we all suspect her ocd was overbearing because she spent the night there a few times a week and we believe she must have been trying to control his life and telling him how to do his laundry, how to clean, harassing him the way she does me and the rest of family. 

Idk what to do she won’t move out and if she does she’ll end up back home because no one would be able to last a week even 2 days with her nonsense. and I’m too broke to move myself I’m not even 20 yet. I told her she really needs to see a psychiatrist because she is overbearing and quite frankly annoying and this isnt normal. Parents said same thing. She ignored me and them and said she is “normal”. My parents wont push further because she doesn’t listen to reason. I get being sanitary I do and with corona now TOTALLY but its just like every time I come home I am bombarded with how I am cleaning things “wrong” and just is a complete control freak needs everything perfect 24/7. Got a 7 paragraph text today about how i can’t be pooping in bathroom more than once a day. It caused me such bad anxiety over time, I was throwing up every day for over a year and had no idea why no doctor could figure it out..finally went on anxiety meds and now i dont throw up at all. I can blame my puking on her this is the only thing that gives me anxiety shes just a handful. (with that i wasnt allowed to throw up in the bathroom I had to puke in a bucket in my own room) 

I literally want to die like shes never gonna leave, my parents will never make her and by the way she CAN financially afford it to live on her own if she wanted... and i financially can’t i owe a lot of medical bills (i did math its gonna take me years before i can move out)  from all these doctors ive seen about my own throwing up issue thank god its fixed but now I know she was the sole cause of my severe anxiety and daily vomiting. I feel trapped in my own home I try to be home as little as possible but every time I come home I have to mentally prepare myself for the harassment. I lock my door blare my music but then am spammed over text. If i decide to leave door unlocked she bangs until i answer it and after a few minutes will use HER FOOT to open my door (ew what the heck!) becquse she doesnt wanna dirty her hand touching the handle. 

constantly asks me to open drawers or cabinets or doors in house because they are too dirty to touch.. 
i could go on and on but you get the jist.

38,"Have a hard time not gaming questions from people wanting to help you?

I have a hard time answering questions honestly. I'm currently on medication for depression and anxiety but I can't seem to tell my doctor and partner the depths I'm in. Most of the time, especially on medical questionnaires and interviews, I can provide answers enough to keep concern but keep me out of what I perceive as trouble.

I lie about moods, drinking and cannabis use. I do feel better since starting on venlaflaxine, but I still hate being around people. Almost all of the time I feel the need the need to numb myself before or after dealing with other humans.

I realise that mental illness is not my fault, but it is my responsibility. I'm not sure where my responsibilities end and when I should be asking for more help. Its been a long time since I've seriously considered self harm, but I do say ""I want to kill myself"" or ""I wish I was dead"" at least once a day.",05Jul2020,1
39,"I guess I never realised this could be considered bad in terms of my mental health but I’ve realised how this period of self-isolation (4 months alone) I’ve been using starvation as a tactic to punish myself for anything and everything I feel guilty about. I feel like a prisoner in self isolation but yet I feel terrible about feeling that way because there are people literally fighting for their lives out there. I’m still allowed to leave the house for necessities and it’s not like I’m forced to stay inside 24/7 but I feel morally obligated not to leave at all. I feel guilty for the few times I messed up and left the house not wearing a mask. I feel guilty I haven’t been motivated enough to put much effort into my work. And worst of all, I feel guilty about even feeling terrible about this whole pandemic situation because I’m one of the lucky ones. 

All of this has led me to use starvation as a way to punish myself, to justify my feelings. To make me feel as though I’m just a little bit more worthy of having these feelings. I’ve lost 7kg in the last 4 months and I haven’t been this light since I was 14. I believe I’m now underweight or close to it and this change in my body has only added to the lost of my sense of myself. I placed a lot of my self-identity in my hair and clothes and body and now that I’ve lost so much of it, I feel guilty that I’ve done this. And then I feel guilty about feeling guilty because I’m not the one dying from the virus and it just continues to go into a never ending cycle. 

I don’t know how to break out of this.",05Jul2020,1
40,"This is hard to explain but I’ll add an example that happened today. I borrowed my dads car to drive and see some friends and hit it on the curb by accident scraping it and damaging the tire a little bit. It wasn’t so bad but I cried driving home because I felt guilty and stupid and a failure. He trusted me and I scraped his car. Then I was thinking about how one day he won’t be around which made me cry more. 

Then I thought about the times I had a short temper with him or got easily annoyed which made me continue to cry. I got home and showed him the car and he said it was okay and not to cry but ive just been in a depressive state for the rest of the day and i’m scared that because im embarrassing and a failure my friends probably don’t even like me. 

All because of a scraped car

44,"My trauma is much less serious than a lot of the trauma other people have suffered from, but now that I've stopped taking drugs I realise that I've still not exactly dealt with it very well.

I'm a 22 year old male, and from the ages of 14 through to 16 I was in an on/off relationship with a girl that was emotionally abusive, and sometimes physically abusive. She'd had her fair share of trauma that dated back to the early years of her childhood so I really do feel for her. She really struggled to deal with it and I think that lead to her taking it all out on me.

She was my first love and for years (even through the abuse) I thought I'd found 'the one'. It wasn't until I was about 18 that I'd given up on the idea that she was the girl of my dreams.

We were totally obsessed with each other and nothing was more important to us than the love we shared. Typical teenager stuff I guess. We were extremely happy with each other until about 8 months into our relationship. I'd never been so happy in all my life, but suddenly she turned extremely cold towards me and I couldn't figure out why. One minute she'd be extremely loving and the next she'd be absolutely brutal in the way she treated me. I'd wrack my brain all the time trying to figure out what I was doing wrong but it only made me even more confused. She was later diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, but this wasn't until after our relationship.

When our relationship turned sour I hit an extremely low point where I was severely depressed and self harming quite often. The only person I'd turn to about any of it was her, but whenever she saw the cuts on my arm or I'd open up to her about being depressed, she'd tell me I need to man up and that I'll never be a man. I was 14 years old and she was putting me down on an almost daily basis for not being a man. It got the a point where I'd tell her I loved her and she'd tell me to man up and quit being so pathetic. She called me pathetic whenever she took her anger out on me which was almost every day.

She used to absolutely adore it when I'd tell her I love her, but now she'd begun putting me down for it. She used to tell me all the time about how much she needed me and how she'd always love me, but now she was telling me she can't be with me anymore and that I disgusted her. It was like she'd go into a blind rage where she was someone completely unrecognisable, and then she'd be the most loving girl I'd ever met.

She'd break up with me and tell me it was so she could go out and sleep with other guys (these other guys turned out to be some of my closest friends), and then a day or two later she'd come back to me telling me about everything she'd done and how she needed me always and I was the only 'man' she truly wanted. It was a constant cycle for about a year and I was so in love with her that I'd take her back every single time. I ended up severely insecure and more depressed than I've ever been. I've never been so depressed still to this day. I kept a lot of my depression to myself and would rarely tell her how much it was affecting me, but whenever I couldn't handle it anymore and I'd open up to her or she'd find cuts on my body - she'd just tell me I need to be a man and that I disgusted her. I'd start crying over it and she'd unleash her rage and tell me she's gonna go fuck my friend and send me videos of it. She'd cheat on me so often that it turned me extremely insecure and I ended up a really jealous guy but my low self esteem became something that'd she'd use against me on an almost daily basis.

We'd be texting and she'd suddenly go ""btw I'm sexting Joe, just thought I'd tell you"". This was while we were dating. I hate the term 'simp' but that's literally what I was at that point in time cause I stuck by her through it all. She used to love when I wrote her little love letters and sneak them in her jacket pocket for her to find later, but now she'd find them and tell me to man up or she'll leave me. I'd always beg her to stay but she'd leave me for a day or two, then come back to me breaking her heart about how she'll always love me and she'd always need me.

At one point I told her I'd stopped self harming, which I had, but one day she threatened to leave me and I gave in and cut my wrist. Later that day she came to my house to work things out with me so I put on a long sleeve shirt to hide my cuts. Things ended up going really well and we were in the middle of a loving moment when she noticed the new cuts on my wrist. She totally flipped out again and told me she was leaving me for not being man enough and for breaking my word about never self harming again. She'd push me to the point of breaking down on an almost daily basis and she'd tell me she can't cope with it. At the age of 22 I still don't feel like a man. It's embarrassing but I feel like less of a man than everyone around me. Even people that are younger than I am that look up to me in some way.

One time she broke up with me, and the next night I went to a party at my friends house, got absolutely wasted and hooked up with two girls. I was fucking devastated when I sobered up because I really did still love her. The day after the party I went to her house cause she really wanted to take me back. I didn't tell her about the two girls from the night before, but she found out the next day at school. She hooked me a few times in front of all of my friends, and I was just breaking down about how sorry I was but everyone that heard about what I'd done turned against me. Pretty much every single friend I had suddenly hated me. I never told anyone about the months of abuse she'd been putting me through because I didn't realise I was being abused and I didn't wanna run my mouth about her around the school, but my reputation totally fell apart and not a single friend stood by me.

I was so in love with her that I didn't even realise she was abusive until I was about 18 years old. This was a couple years after our final break up. There were times where she'd hook me in the jaw cause she couldn't handle her anger issues, and she even threw me down her stairs one time when I was 15.

Just 3 or 4 days after our final break up I tried LSD for the first time. The day after that I tried coke and another upper called mephedrone for the first time. This set me off on a drug phase that didn't end until a month ago, and the first year or two of it all was one big crazy mental breakdown where I was absolutely losing it. I'm definitely more sane now but I was in my own world for a couple of years and it freaked the fucked out of my family and everyone that knew me.

I was riddled with guilt, depression and anxiety for years and still to this day I've hardly moved on to the next step in life. I've just stewed in the mess ever since and it's embarrassing.

I left school due to depression and I'd ended up trying to kill myself twice with overdoses at 15/16 and put myself in the hospital both times. I was self harming a lot and spending most of my time in my room taking drugs which totally fried my mind. I'd lost all of my friends within a couple weeks of the break up and even the relationship with my family completely changed. Life was nothing like it was before. I was taking uppers a few times a week from 15 through til I turned 17, and I ended up addicted to opiate painkillers and sold most of my belongings. I'd spend months at a time without a single day of sobriety taking on average 35 painkillers in 24 hours. Even spending weeks on morphine at times. I quit the opiates at the start of this year after overdosing a couple times by mistake, and I was smoking weed every day without fail from 16 til just last month.

I desperately wanted to stop taking drugs for about 4 or 5 years because they were making me extremely socially anxious and I'd lost an insane amount of weight to the point I was only 87 lbs. I was constantly in debt to different people I didn't wanna be in debt to. The anxiety only made my low self esteem so much worse which was the worst part of it all. I embarrassed myself on a daily basis with how difficult it was to think straight and form a simple sentence because my mental clarity was so bad. It ruined my relationship with everyone cause I was always hiding away in my room.

I've been in the same spot in life since I was 15 and I'm now 22. 7 years and I've still not found a full time job. I've just fucked around wasting my life and now that I've stopped taking drugs 38 days ago, I've been drinking for the last 30 days even though I'm beyond sick and tired of not being sober. I hardly even like drinking. My friend smoked heroin in front of me a few nights back so I asked him if I could try some but he said no.

I was happy for about a week when I stopped taking drugs, but I ended up with more mental clarity than I've had since I was 15. This is a great thing and I'd been desperately trying to find mental clarity for years, but I also realised that still to this day I've not dealt with the insecurities and self esteem issues that I ended up with when I was with my ex girlfriend. For years now, whenever I leave the house to go see friends of mine I've needed to take drugs or drink, and I can't seem to get past that. If I don't take something I just end up really socially anxious about being around people. I used to be so outgoing and cheery around my friends up until I was 15/16 and I've never been the same way since. I'm still avoiding people any chance I get unless I'm on something or I've had a drink. I've wanted to get sober for years now but there are so many things that trigger me when it comes to being around anyone and it's so easy to just give in.

I know this post sounds incredibly whiney, but I'm definitely stronger than I was when I was younger. I very rarely stop to dwell on my issues, but the reason I'm posting here is that the last week or so I've realised how much my past relationship still has a huge effect on me and the way I live my life. I got over my ex from years ago when I was 18 or so, but I guess I'm just not quite over the trauma of the past. It's been about 8 years and I thought I'd done a great job, but I stopped taking drugs and realised it was the drugs that kept me held together.

When I was 19 I ended up in a new relationship which lasted 2 years. Everything was great for the first year. Not a single argument! Suddenly everything came crashing down again and my insecurities that I'd suppressed a few years before it came back in a big way and it ended up being a strain on our relationship. We broke up about a year ago now and for 6 months I was hitting the drink and drugs every day which is exactly what happened when I was 16 and I broke up with my first ex. Just didn't last as long this time, thankfully.


Basically, I'm wondering if there'd be much of a point in starting therapy. I used to see a therapist on and off for a couple years when I was 15/16, but I didn't find it very helpful at all. They actually focused more on making a diet plan for me than anything else because I was taking drugs a lot at the time and they didn't wanna focus much on treating my mental health until I was 3 months sober. I kinda see what they were getting at, but 3 months sober at that point in time sounded impossible.

I'm sorry for the long post. I typed it all up in about an hour so it may come across pretty rushed. It all sounds a bit scattered but it'd be interesting to hear your thoughts if you'd like to share them.

Cheers folks.",05Jul2020,1

49,"Hey all,

So I've been dealing with a lot of mental turmoil lately and just need someone to sort of help conceptualize the way I'm feeling and maybe give a few tips or some stories of relation if possible. 

Basically, I am 22 and have never had an intimate relationship in my life (nor have I even kissed or hugged someone of the opposite sex outside of my mother). Now before I am misjudged, I do not in any way shape or form consider myself an incel or blame any of my perils on women. My problem is that from a young age I've been pretty much disconnected from the opposite sex. Growing up in elementary school I was very nerdy and considered ""weird"", while also not being mature enough for any real relationship obviously. Then come middle and high school when things like that were a bit more normalized I was around 230 pounds at 5'5"" and didn't even really hit puberty until the end of high school, which caused enormously low self-esteem. Despite the lack of connection with females in high school I had a very solid friend group and was able to make some great achievements both grade-wise and in Vo-Tech. Towards the end of high school, I got addicted to smoking pot and cigs which caused me to become extra reclusive towards most people including my own friend group.  I started college shortly after graduating and became pretty depressed throughout. I continued smoking pot daily including before class and somehow managed to maintain respect from my peers as well as finish with a decent GPA, however, I completely missed out on the social/networking aspect due to always ducking lunch meetups or after class study sessions to smoke pot or go home and play games. It's worth noting that my major was male-dominated as well so my root problem never really got close to being fixed.  

Towards the end of college, I began working at a retail store, I was at that point around 5'9"" and 145 pounds due to pretty much starving myself throughout college from stress/sadness. While it was a bad way to lose weight that job was the first time I ever received any female attention in my life and I didn't know how to handle it at all. I remember pretty much blowing an opportunity with 3 different girls, one adored me but I was super annoyed by her (probably because I only cared about cigs and weed), another planned to play Xbox with me one night but I went out to smoke pot with friends instead and got ghosted, and the third I started texting but came off as desperate due to the sheer excitement of finally being able to text a woman.  After graduating I quit that job by just not showing up anymore and got a new job within my field which was totally male-dominated. 

From 2019-2020 I was at this job and promised myself that I would start dating within the year. Due to my job, I relied mainly on Tinder/OkCupid which I think led everything further downhill. As many here can probably relate, performance on Tinder feels like a direct mirror of your own attractiveness and I failed horribly. I would get matches fairly often but just wouldn't know what to say at all and would constantly get tied up in my own mind on what to say. If I wasn't getting matches I'd be super obsessive over my pictures/bio to the point that I don't feel comfortable with a single picture I have or a single bio anymore. I would say over the year I matched with roughly 60 women, 30 of which were bots, and the other 30 I either said something completely stupid or never got a reply off the start. Once COVID hit I lost my job (super small company) and have been on unemployment and considering a degree switch since. 

To keep this somewhat short, this whole cycle continued all the way up until now but is being exacerbated even more due to COVID. I realize that as of right now my only option is online dating but I am not comfortable with a single thing relating to my own profiles. I will post pictures and a bio and within 2 hours look back at it and think ""you look ugly this is stupid"" and close the account. On the flip side, I've at least quit pot and nicotine a few months ago and have found a new love in lifting weights which I've consistently done for the better part of a year now. It just feels like I'm in a cycle where I do not feel complete due to the fact that I have never had a relationship and virtually every single one of my friends has or currently is in one, but I also realize that this incompleteness is massively hindering my ability to date and is probably giving off a huge vibe of desperation to nearly any woman I meet in real life. The past few nights I've been going into severely neurotic episodes at night and figured tonight I'd just spill everything out on here and see if anyone can relate or help me in any way. I am willing to clarify anything within this writeup if needed and greatly appreciate anyone who takes the time to read through this.",05Jul2020,1
50,"I posted this in r/pro life tips and it got deleted. You guys might already know this, but here’s a (hopefully) helpful reminder to check in on yourself:

It’s easy to forget to check in on yourself. Huge indicators that you may be headed for a breakdown can be seemingly small things like: messy apartment/room/house, the state of your personal relationships (are you talking to/being honest with other people?), your financial situation (overspending, not paying bills), feeling a lack of empathy for other people, not keeping up with basic hygiene, losing your appetite, etc. 

These have been indicators for me that something was seriously wrong. Hopefully this helps someone who may not know how to recognize the signs. If you step back and realize things aren’t going well, it’s a great chance to reach out to your support group, contact a therapist, or even check yourself in to a mental health facility.",05Jul2020,1
51,"I'm part of a family of 4, my parents, my sister, and me. For the last couple of months I've had moments where I feel like utter garbageo. My sister is studying in college in a medical field and my parents brag a lot about her. Here I am, a highschooler wanting to go into computer science, president of my school's computer science honor society, part of my school's robotics team, leader and founder of my school's Music Composition Club yet I never hear my parents brag about me. My sister grew up as the almost perfect A student, and while she had her problems, my parents knew and helped her with her stress. 
My parents have never really shares my main interests like music and robotics. I've shown my parents some music I've made before and their main response was ""why not make some Hindi music"", I enjoy making synth music significantly more and don't enjoy making Hindi music. I no longer show my parents my music because they just shrug it off, they don't call my other family members about how I made an album and how nice it is, but they'll go off on how my sister is doing in college. I'm working on a major project rn and I'm excited about it but they wouldn't care, they wouldn't even understand it. I have also tried showing them stuff relating to robotics, but they're not too ""wow'd"" mainly because they don't understand the thing I'm showing them or they don't really care much about it. 
The biggest thing nagging at me has been how ""proud"" they are of me. The last time I've ever heard any of my parents say they're proud of me was during a robotics competition in which we won an award. This was back on freshman year, I'm a senior now.

53,"kinda scared to post this cause of the title.

i have never self harmed, physically at least. I'm not abused by anyone. Not bullied, i mean not by anyone else. Just me. 

Before you say ""You have a future ahead of you!"" I don't. Lack of motivation to do literally beneficial for myself is kind of a bitch. Yes I tried to better myself, and immediately failed. 

I'm too much of a pussy to actually do it, plus my mom would be sad. 

I'm also too much of a pussy to get any help irl, or to post this on my actual account. I lied to a counselor two times about what i wanna do.

I sit on my ass on my computer and phone all day, and during the quarantine it's for 16 - 21 hours a day when I should have been doing school work online. I talk to no one unless it's at school. My phone is always dry. ik discord friends would like to help but im too much of a pussy to tell them. 

tl;dr I do nothing all day and I mentally abuse myself because of it. And i'm not gonna tell anyone that cause im a pussy.

just wanted to spit that out somewhere even if it's no where. 

No, I don't want to talk about it. If you try ill either just not respond or just say no. 

Thanks for listening tho",05Jul2020,1
55,"It's a long post and somewhat disturbing

First of all. I'm 21 years old and male and from the uk

I live in a hostel where I'm pretty comfy. The staff are helpful even though I don't accept it most the time. I'm working with someone to help me figure out what I want to do with my life and help me towards that goal. I'm genuinely happy here and I'm grateful to be here. Got here about 6 months ago.

Before I was here I lived with my mother. I've lived with her pretty much my entire life and I feel like I've lost out on those first 20 years. Ik it's something I'll never get back and I've done a lot of things I regret and they still haunt me to this day.

I usually get put down when I'm honest with myself but idc right now. My mother is absolutely awful. Not just to me but as a person. She's lazy, entitled, pretentious, arrogant and she's been nothing but awful to me. I'm not trying to shift blame here, I know what I've done and I'm sorry for it but every problem I've had can be traced back to her in some way.

Just to list some of the things she's done to me. She's attacked me with various objects, spat at me, threatened to kill me, threatened me with her crackhead bf's, made fun of me, manipulated me when I was younger, broke my belongings, forced me to sell my belongings, made fake accusations against me (telling people that I taped her, beat her, stole from her, that I'm a paedophile. I'm not any of those things nor have I done them). Also, I'm not 100 percent on this but I think she's let people sexually assault me. 

I haven't really opened up to anyone about this because i feel like I'll break down. It's so much just to lay on someone.

Anyways. Nearly at the nightmare.
A while back, my mother had spent the last of her money on weed. We had no food or anything so I had to ask my sister for money. It's a little bit which I was very grateful for and I could make it last me ages but my mother wanted a McDonald's. She's a child and she eats literally nothing but McDonald's. Anyways I tried to tell her that we only had a tiny bit of money and that I had to eat too. She wasn't having it and she was doing her usual ""it's McDonald's or nothing"" routine. I had enough and just went to the shop and got a load of food. She begrudgingly ate it all the while screeching at me at the top of her lungs. After she was done she threw the plate at my door. This really upset me and I got a bit angry so I go into her room and say ""wtf you doing"" and all that, I called her some names too and I push this small lamp on the floor.

 It was really petty but I didn't know how to handle the emotions I was feeling at the time. I was angry and I wanted to hit her but I know I'm a better person than that (I've never struck her btw). Anyways I walk out and she chases me and starts punching me in the back of the head and scratching me. I start pushing her away from me but she kept coming back and eventually started pulling my hair and punching me so I push her to the floor and pin her wrists to the floor until she stops fighting. I let her go and she walks into her room calling me all these names and it was the same as usual after that. Ringing people telling them I beat her and sexually assaulted her.

That was the end of that pretty much. Now the actually nightmare. I'm basically replying this event in my head up until I restrain her on the floor. She gets her wrist loose and takes a swing for me. Then I grab her wrist with both my hands and I bite a huge chunk out of it. The wound is in great detail. I can see all the bones in her wrist and it's bleeding like crazy. 

I woke straight up after that which was about 9pm (I was having a nap) it's 4 am now and I've felt so uneasy. I'm disgusted at the dream and it turns my stomach thinking about it. I'm freaking out because I don't know what it means or why I thought of that. I've never even seen the inside of a wrist and it was so vivid I can't forget it.

I'm not a violent person. I don't hit people or get into fights. I don't take drugs and I occasionally drink. I'm not on any meds or anything. If you're still reading this then thank you for taking the time out of your day.",05Jul2020,1

A few I can think of right away:

- Therapy is for crazy people, and I’m not crazy 
- I’m too busy/don’t have the time in my schedule 
- it’s too expensive/no resources

However, I have some friends that will tell me that they cannot remember anything from their own childhood because of the things they faced. It sort of confuses me?

Even during quarantine I would see her maybe once a week because all the other time was set aside for her boyfriend. I get it, honeymoon phases or whatever, having a bf is super fun and feels great, etc. But I'm just so lonely. I know it's inappropriate to expect my friend to hangout with me more when she's doing what makes her happy, but I just don't know what to do.. am I putting too much of my own happiness into my friendship? Should I be able to not care if my friend can't hangout as much as I would like? My mom has alluded that this is normal and that maybe I should get a boyfriend. But if this is normal, does that mean that everybody on earth just doesn't hangout with friends very much once they have a partner? I've been trying to work on myself and not let my value be determined by having a bf or not, but now that almost seems futile because what's the point if everybody else is doing it? idk. Does that even make sense?

63,"*MH trigger warning* (also this will be spotty, as mine are usually spotty)
It’s like a dream over takes my vision; a memory that isn’t my own, but is from my own perspective. The same song is playing in the background, but I’m two years back. I’m on the floor, surrounded by my own blood and a knife that belonged to my old roommate. 

I remember more this time

I yell at an old friend, that I now remember that I’ve called. I remember now how the blood i wiped off the door got on there. I remember stumbling over to unlock the chain for them. I remember yelling at them to not take a photo because I knew I couldn’t handle remembering it all. They made me throw up and threw me in the tub to find all of the places I’d hurt myself (they used to be a firefighter and had a bit of training). 

x

I’m in the shower the next morning, looking at my arm, objectively seeing the skin cells and the fat cells. Instead of being concerned, my brain covered this up by appreciating the human anatomy course I had taken before I had transferred universities...before I let two different psychiatrists misdiagnose my grief as depression and put me on a dangerous dose of an antidepressant. 

x

I’ve been four different places for a short few seconds, remembering how I broke glass, used nail clippers, over drank, or just did something stupid to try and escape the pain I was in. The pain I knew I shouldn’t be in. The pain my brain justifiably shouldn’t be feeling. 

I remember it all as if it’s my first time experiencing it. 

I slowly become nauseous and want to disappear from sheer embarrassment from what I put my friends through. 

x

There’s a reason why antidepressants has a black box warning on them. I share my experience to encourage other young adults to ask for a brain scan before they’re in a situation I was and now am in. 

These scars should not be my own. These scars are not me and they will not define me. My brain was developed enough to not do something like this, but I failed myself to not fight the health system in the US until it was too late (I was hospitalized bc of these meds, and it took my parents coming to yell at a social worker to prevent a second hospitalization and get me off the medication). 

Take care of yourselves.

If you're not in a relationship, you're just lonely? Is that how it is for everyone or am I just doing something wrong? Do you learn to not be lonely when you're alone all the time?

I feel like my only chance at happiness is getting a boyfriend and I've been trying really hard recently to not let my happiness/worth be determined by if a man wants me or not. I think it's important to learn to be happy alone but it's like a slap in the face realizing no one close to me shares that ideal.

73,"Hi, since college days I've been struggling on my habit of binge internet everyday and it get worse on weekends. During workdays days I managed to get around 6-7 hours of sleep but on weekday sometimes I only got 5 hrs of sleep, sometimes if I'm lucky I get around 8 hours of sleep, btw I live in noisy neighborhood almost everyday construction noise are always persistent, loud edm music, hill song etc, noise mostly starts at 7am. Catching up sleep on weekends is a struggle as well.

 I tend to have a habit of binging on Netflix, memes, socmed and games even on workdays, but it gets worse when its nearing end of the workday. I dunno I tend to act like a teenager when it comes to my sleeping habit, I have not so consistent sleep schedule on weekdays I tried to get at least some 6-7 hours of sleep, I tried to sleep before 1am but anxiety always get me awake at night, thinking about work, awkward conversation, past mistakes, existential dread, self loathe. Then on weekends I struggle to follow that not so ideal sleep schedule but I end my binging on same hobbies around 2 or 3 am worst 4 am, hence fucking up my bad sleep schedule more. I tried to use apps to manage my sleep schedule/anxiety but every time I finished a course example 1 month better sleep course I tend to spiral out of control again, I tried to journal everyday but I stopped, maybe because I was in stressful week at work, to forget the struggles at work I binge on same hobbies, it's been a week now since my last journal entry. 

My sleeping pattern/habits is now affecting everything from work, to family, even friends, takes noticing I've become irrational, irritable, out of focus, snub etc, worse are poor decisions at work partly brought by the lack of sleep. Also my dark humor has intensified maybe a coping mechanism to my failures. Also I struggle to learn my attention span is now of a goldfish. What's worse is that I have to learn new things almost everyday at work, working at it where learning new things, trainings are a must to keep up with technology, I hardly learn something.

 I cringe on the quality of work I did, I felt like I'm the bad apple in the office, the weakest link, the slowest to learn or the one who couldn't follow instructions or do decent report/presenting. On health I'm now hypertensive, easily forgetting (I sometimes joke to friends that dementia has set in)

But the thought of my parents brothers or friends knowing is terrible to me. And I don’t know why. I can talk to my school counselor, but she always calls my mom. I talk to my therapist but  she’ll tell my my parents if there is something big wrong with me. And besides that talking about it is really hard. I just freeze up. 

I need a way to explain my feelings and get help, but I don’t want to almost. My parents are not doing anything to me, but I often find myself wanting to run away, to escape. I have brothers, and I share my room with one of them and I hate it. But I don’t know why. I don’t like hanging out with them, or being alone. I don’t know what’s happening and I feel like I can’t tell anybody IRL. Because nothing they ever do is helpful. It’s just trying to talk about it (which I can’t do) and bringing up what I think started it (although it might have started before) which makes everything worse. I want to be helped but if I do have some sort of mental illness (we talked about depression and stuff in school and I’m exhibiting many signs) I want to be left alone. I don’t want things to be different, I want the help without the conversations with my parents, but I can’t have that. 

And another thing. Every time I see a meme about teenage girls self diagnosing themselves with mental illness I feel like I’m making this all up. Like it’s fake because that’s just a teenage gril thing. And then it’s always “period” “your PMSing” even when I know I’m not because my period ended a week before.

I hate sharing a room. I hate being forced to hang out with my family. I hate everything and I don’t know why. My life is great. Two really bad things have happened to me specifically recently, and even before the coronavirus I’ve been really sad, even though there are countless ways this could be worse.

85,"My lovely panic attack started today just before we got to my partner's parents house, where we were meant to be having brunch with them, his three brothers and wives/children. While I get along with his family, I am very wary of his two younger (twin)brothers, who are self-satisfied, rude, and obnoxious. They tend to expect things to go their way basically all the time. I'm not the only one to think this either. 
Anyway, in the start it was a mild attack, but then as his brother greeted us by tapping his watch (we were cooking bacon and eggs for everyone) I lost my head and had a go at him. Needless to say, I was judging myself heavily for that and it made me more anxious. 
While I was cooking, I became incredibly anxious, and could barely talk to anyone, or look at anyone because I was on the verge of years the whole time. Which was great, just as one of the younger brothers and wife announced they were having another baby. I knew this was coming, because they never organise family get togethers unless they have some other reason. But while it's a very joyous moment, I couldn't muster the false happiness that I should be feeling for them (middle of a panic attack, I'm also sick of everything they say and do being about babies, and also, my partner and I are putting off children for a little while, which makes me sad). I couldn't deal with this news and while I managed to hold it together, I also felt like a fraud with a very fake congratulations. 
I had to keep it together for another almost two hours before I could go home and fall apart. I just want to keep crying and my mind is going in circles and I can't deal with my thoughts and I don't want to keep judging myself, but wanted to vent it. 
It's so hard sometimes not to believe you're a bad person for something so small. I feel like everyone noticed my behaviour and I feel so ashamed.

After a while I start to feel sick to my stomach and always end up getting morning sickness the next day. I end up sitting over the toilet purely because I stressed myself out so much it takes such a toll on my body. I’m wondering if anyone else suffers this kind of relationship/confrontation triggered anxiety? the idea that I’m hurting someone I love or that a relationship I have with someone could potentially end/be damaged (even when it’s not even a huge deal or is actually the other persons fault), it just sends me into a state of panic. Not really sure where to go from here because it’s gotten to the point where it’s causing me so much stress and exhaustion from my overthinking and anxiousness that I just want to work towards a solution. If anyone has experience with this or knows ways that may help to reduce my stress or deal physical symptoms that would be great :)",05Jul2020,1

I keep thinking that everyone I love will die soon, that i'll never see them again. I'm christian but It's hard to truly believe that I'll be able to see everyone again.

Perhaps I'm the one that will die, and I'm mourning for the ones I love.

Everyday if someone isn't with me or is not in the room I will start feeling sad and begin to mourn for them even though I know they're fine and they are not dead.

Maybe I'm really clingy and soft hearted, but it feels so real, like they're gone gone. That I will never see them again. I cry. 
I cry at night worrying about people I care about. 
I'm so scared, I feel like everyone will die soon, that something terrible is about to happen. 

Something like a tragedy, like I'll die or someone(s) will die very, very soon. 

I'm constantly worried, I'm scared, I'm really scared, I feel like everyone will vanish. I'm sorry.

89,"During the first wave of COVID, I took a break and deactivated all my social media accounts because I had a gut feeling I would be better without it. It made me feel really anxious all the time beneath the surface. For some reason, I feel really uncomfortable seeing what’s going on with others and seeing pictures of them.

I recently wanted to start pursuing twitch streaming with the support of my friends but I knew I would need to market and outreach through my social media’s so I redownloaded and reactivated. 

I scrolled through my Instagram feed for an hour or so and I feel so unstable. I feel like I am unhinged and I just have so much discomfort I want to scream. I feel like crying and shaking and never leaving my bed again. I don’t understand why it disturbs me this much. I don’t know if I’m using social media as a scape goat for my anxiousness or it’s the cause.

Her mom doesn’t understand her mental health and I don’t think she knows that her daughter is self harming. I haven’t told anyone else about this, but one of my other friends knows about it.

92,"Sorry if I had any grammar problems mistakes, I'm bad at English.

I've been feeling this way for like 3 years now, but even now I'm still unsure if I'm just lying for attention and I still hate myself for it.


I've manipulated multiple people in the past and I even accept that I can be toxic sometimes. I just lie in my vents to act as if I'm in a crisis to make them worry about me. I feel so relieved knowing that someone cares about me even though I was always lying. I hate it so much but it's almost like no one realizes my feelings unless I purposely search for care.


I'm an artist myself and often gets compliments on my works, just recently I noticed how much I actually hated compliments and how it has blinded me from all the flaws. It was at that moment I started hating everything I did, never really expressed my disgust for myself in public for a while, here I am again.


I feel so weirdly attached to people who are considered manipulative, not because they manipulated me but because I can emphasize with them in a way. I actually enjoy it when people harass and critique my whole being. I don't even know why. I once interacted with someone with HPD and they randomly vanished all of a sudden and I still can't get over it because of how attached I was.


Despite how devastated I sound in my vents, I often am still like a normal person on the outside, I have some friends, I enjoy chatting with them. Don't even know which is fake and which is real in my feelings anymore. I feel like I'm exaggerating everything when at the same time I'm so sad, desperate for reassurement. I want to die, but I'm terrified of what will happen if I fail. I really just want something that can explain what is wrong with me, it's so tiring and I can't bear living without thinking about how others think about me. ",05Jul2020,1

94,"Honestly, like many people on here, I’ve just been having a very hard time lately. I can’t shake the feeling that everything I hold close to my heart is being ripped away one by one. I was facing some anxiety and depression before coronavirus was even a thing, feeling pretty hopeless and all but my boyfriend was really supportive and reminded me I’m not broken and helped me find a therapist through our school. My life literally seemed perfect on paper like loving family, great school, good GPA, awesome relationship, financially stable, but I was still so sad and I couldn’t help it.

And then once corona hit and I had to move back home and my boyfriend and I became long distance it’s like everything external started to go downhill too. My pet of 10 years passed away, my dad lost his job, my boyfriend broke up with me, and now it seems like you name it, everything I start looking forward to gets screwed up somehow. 

My parents are really worried for me and make me send them pictures of me eating to prove that I ate since I’ve lost a ton of weight, and they witnessed one of my panic attacks just last week, but I’ve been having them for a while. My boyfriend and I ended well at first but I was really sad because I loved him so much and he wasn’t sad at all... and I just got so unexplainably mad at him for that. I feel like my depression ruined our relationship because I would have episodes and try to talk to him about all the ways my brain was sabotaging me and he just couldn’t understand and had to leave. And that’s a sucky sucky feeling because he was one of the only people who was really supporting me, and when I got angry I went off on him and I feel like I ruined that friendship as well and he’s just going to think I’m crazy.

Lately I’ve had weird thoughts around suicide. Mostly this: I feel like my entire problem for all my life has been this obsessive need to please other people. And for that reason I literally could not kill myself. I couldn’t stand bringing pain to my family like that, and I couldn’t stand people thinking I was selfish that I had everything so perfect and still couldn’t push through life, and I’ve grown up religious so obviously suicide has some bad stigma around it there. And even though it might seem like a good thing that I can’t kill myself, it almost makes me feel more helpless. Because if I knew I could just end things and life could have no more struggles then at least i have that control over my life, but instead it’s like I’m letting everyone else control it and physically cannot take my life into my own hands, not to mention that now it seems like that easy out isn’t possible and I’m going to HAVE to do life the hard way. Just feels very hopeless. 

I know that’s probably a bad thought to have and I’ve been trying to find a therapist around my home but since I’m working 40 hours a week and now my dad lost his job and we can’t afford anything expensive, it seems so impossible. 

Idk, it just sucks that I have these thoughts because I feel like depression will be so much baggage in whatever relationship I have from now on since it already made this very supportive guy that I loved so so much run away. And even though there shouldn’t be, there’s just such a stigma behind mental health problems and I’m afraid no one’s gonna wanna marry “depressed girl who has to post her suicidal thoughts on reddit because she doesn’t have anyone else who will understand” 

I’m sorry, there’s really no TLDR for this except that everything I love seems to be slipping away and I feel very hopeless but that’s everyone rn anyway. 🤷🏼‍♀️",05Jul2020,1
95,"No matter what I achieve, I always feel like I failed myself and fell short of my ridiculously high standards that I've convinced myself is reasonable. It's like being in an abusive relationship with myself.

I recently landed a job. More of a long-term internship(co-op) for the next 6 months. I'm in grad school full time but I'll be working for the next semester instead of going to classes. 

Many of my classmates were struggling to land internships even pre-COVID, including me. Come COVID, most of them gave up applying because every company was sending them the ""We've cancelled our internship program due to COVID"" email. The point is, on paper, it's supposed to be a ""good"" accomplishment that I landed this job given how competitive the environment is. However, me being me, I've told myself that I shouldn't have gotten the job, that this wasn't a difficult interview and that I was just lucky, that I should have gotten something better. That I don't deserve it. 

I want to now try and con myself into believing that I do deserve this job, and I want to do it by celebrating. Having not been happy in a very long time, I don't know how to treat myself. I thought I'd buy a bottle of whiskey to enjoy, but then I'm not a big drinker. I've gotten drunk with my friends in the past, but in those occasions I enjoyed the company and not the actual drink itself. I don't even like whiskey that much.

98,"Hi, so I'm going to attempt to explain what I feel sometimes, it's really weird.

Randomly, it feels like someone is pouring a cold liquid on my brain. This liquid is either a rush/wash of hormones/chemicals or electrical sparks. Sometimes the wash occurs and nothing else happens. Lately I've been getting this but like terror/fear is suddenly in liquid form. I'm not scared, like I'll be loading the dishwasher and suddenly my thoughts have a weird terrified aura around them (eg 'this plate goes here, I need to put cups in next' will be a normal thought but it suddenly feels dark and terrifying but also it isn't.) When this happens I'm still totally functional, rational, and it's a bit like I can feel thoughts change auras in a singular part of my brain while the rest of my brain is normal. 
Also, sometimes when this rush of whatever over my brain happens, it feels like a horror movie soundtrack. I literally hear the scary suspense-building sound!! 

When I was little sometimes I would feel like I was super tiny/ant sized in a ginormous space, then immediately random body parts would get bigger until I was giant. I also had the thoughts that felt weird too and something like tv static/tinnatus/THX movie company logo sound feels as well. I thought this situation was just imagination but this weird state of mind has returned! 

Analogy: thoughts have a font. Normally, the font is idk Calibri. Randomly, the font changes to Chiller. Nothing happened to the words, it's now just in a different font! 

Anyways it's not anxiety or panic attacks. It's definitely isolated to the brain. I don't know if I described it perfectly because it's so difficult to explain but yeah that's my weird stuff",05Jul2020,1
100,"Internally i am ashamed to have accept that something is up with me, and now i genuinely don't know what to do. Due to a bad childhood i've felt quite powerless all my life. So naturally, i went into the world of fighting games to feel powerful. It never worked though. What started off as silly salt turned into self harm, i would punch myself if i wasn't able to do something right, mostly in the face or thigh, i would begin to strangle my neck to get anger out, maybe yell, but mostly this rage kept growing. So i tried to stop playing to calm down and joined social medias to try and become a better person since none of us n really go outside too much atm. What turned into simple fun became more anger and even more self harm, this is when i began to use sharp objects to stab things like a desk or planks of wood, and if i were to just shut up and stop, i know i'd go crazy because i'll have to accept in life that i am powerless and can't do anything to change.

102,"So here’s a little backstory on me:
I’m a 16 year old guy. I’m pretty introverted (like 60-70% introverted), I’ve had pretty bad anxiety my entire life (socially and generally). I also have depression. I’m pretty sure I have ADHD and OCD as well. It’s hard for me to make friends, but even harder for me to keep the ones I make. I’ve never had a girlfriend. I’m interested in things that a lot of people aren’t exactly interested in (activism and filmmaking, for example). I come from a close family, but a lot of the time I feel like an outsider. I also feel self conscious about my body, my personality, and pretty much everything about myself a lot of the time.

So here’s my problem: I feel like I’m sinking, as you can read from the title. I feel like things will never be good for me. I feel like I’ll always have feelings of strongly disliking myself. I feel like I’ll never have long-lasting, strong friendships, or a girlfriend. I, a lot of the time, feel like nobody likes me and that people are only nice to me out of pity. I feel like nobody values what I have to say. There’s definitely more to all of this, but that’s everything that I have off the top of my head without making this post too lengthy. I, as you can obviously tell, need advice on how to feel better.

When I go to sleep sometimes I have nightmares with very shocking imagery that tends to leave me petrified, sweating and with a deep irrational fear of everything around me, almost as if someone was out to get me.

Normally what happens is that I wake up in the middle of the night, sweating and unable to move, is then that I start looking at my surroundings and during those moments I feel like something out of my dreams will kill me, and during those moments my entire body is afraid of making a move.

The effects wears after a while, but when I go to sleep I tend to wake up again that same night with the effect repeated, although it tends to last a lot less because I’m more aware of the situation, instead of my sorry ass succumbing to my fears.

The subjects as I said are graphic or plain disgusting, like stepping and crushing fetuses, obese persons defecating, entire rooms made out of greasy and veiny skin, etc.

My head kinda jolts to the side and I get shivers in the back of my head and it runs all the way down to my legs. (I still dont know if this is brain zaps please correct me if this is something different) 

My friend asked me what happened because it looks like a twitch from the outside. I told him what happened and I was informed that this was not normal. 

So I looked to the internet for answers and found that the closest thing to it I could find is called a brain zap. 
The only problem is I thought these were normal because they have been happening my whole life I thought everyone got them. (I actually think they feel good) 

(Side note) I don't  take medication of any kind. And I don't think I suffer from anxiety 

So I'm a little worried and am wondering if anyone has something similar? Are these seizure? Does this mean I've had anxiety my whole life and just didn't know ?

108,"Before I get into the meat of the post, I need to set up something controversial that's not up for debate. Me and this person I'm trying to help are both gay, and we both take a very Christian fundamentalist approach to our sexualities. Meaning we both most definitely believe that gay actions are wrong, and he seems to be very strict about even his feelings (which we call temptations, and I think he's a bit too hard on himself in this area). Many here may not believe that to be the best approach, but please refrain from trying to convince me otherwise on this. That's not the main point of what I need help with, and besides, you wouldn't convince either of us to change our minds.

So anyways, us two met each other almost three weeks ago when I responded to a post where he was crying for help. He was very drunk and very suicidal, and I did my best to talk him off the edge. I don't think I actually convinced him not to kill himself, as I messaged him pretty late after he made his posts about it, but he ended up not trying anything and I wanted to try my best to make sure he didn't get to that place again. He stated in his posts that he wanted to do it because he was gay and it was too much of a burden on him, so I wanted to help him through any traumas that may have been caused by the conflict between his views and his feelings, because I've been in a similar place to him before so I could both understand where he was coming from and potentially provide him hope that he could make it out *without* surrendering to his sin. So, we started talking, and I realized he was dealing with more than I could possibly comprehend.

To put it bluntly, he's a major alcoholic. He drinks to forget the pain of being gay, and it's his latest coping mechanism after somewhat recently giving up self-harm, which he had a long and painful history with (something that I could somewhat, but not totally, understand). He drinks a lot, he told me at least 10 litres of wine a week, and I could tell quite early on that alcohol was a catalyst of his other issues. He almost committed suicide while drunk after all, and he was making things worse by giving into his gay urges while alcohol was controlling his mind, in events he couldn't even remember until later that would fill him with immense guilt upon finding out. Obviously, I knew he needed to solve the alcohol problem before I could even think about focusing on his gay problem with him.

So, I tried my best to help. I know a little bit about addictions from my AP Psych class a couple years ago, plus lurking on the self-harm subreddit, which I initially joined when *I* was addicted to hurting myself. I know about withdrawal, I know about weaning, and I know about support groups. I tried giving him advice as best as I could. Whenever he told me he was going for another glass of wine, I told him no, and to instead drink a glass of water. I sent him the link to the AA website of his country, which I'm fairly certain he either never visited, or he gave up on after somebody he contacted tried to tell him the alcohol problem was more important than the gay problem at the moment (he said a new therapist told him that, and this was after I referred him to AA, so I think it might've been someone he got into contact with there. For the record, I agree with the therapist, that the alcohol is a bigger problem than being gay, and I told him this). Since his mom buys him his alcohol (he's the legal drinking age, but lives with his mom and alcoholic step-dad), I told him, to no avail, to try to wean off of alcohol by having his mom start buying him slightly less per week. Tonight, when he was telling me that he hadn't eaten all day and had only consumed alcohol *for the entire day,* I told him several times to go and eat something and to drink a glass of water, in an effort to get him away from alcohol for just a little bit. He didn't listen to me here either, no matter how many times I told him to eat or how hard I tried. Tonight, after he told me for probably the second or third time that he was getting another glass of wine, I decided to try something new. I told him that if he wasn't going to work to change himself, then I wasn't going to waste time helping, and that I'd leave him to destroy himself. I know it sounds harsh, but sometimes harshness is needed to give someone a cold wakeup to reality, and nothing else had been working at all so I had to try. I doubt this will work either, and he may not even message me anymore because of this.

I just don't know what to do. We only talk over Reddit and Discord, and he lives on the other side of the world, so I have no way to get anybody in his life to actually help him. I can tell he's absolutely controlled by alcohol, and I want to help him slowly free himself, but he simply does not have the willpower or motivation to attempt to work towards improvement. He says alcohol numbs him, and despite my arguments against that, he seems perfectly content to live a numb life of constant drunkenness. I just don't know what to do anymore, or if it's even possible for me to help him at all.",05Jul2020,1
109,"Hi, so just a short background; my gf and I met 5 years ago and we have been best friends for a long time and later we started dating. We are both very active and smart students with a lot of interests - she organises some big events, works in marketing, volunteers in tutoring... you get it. And all of that while studying.

In the past year or so, she started to feel burnt-out due to her numerous activities and responsibilities. As a solution to that, she quited the leading position and only participated in the activities she enjoyed.

Few months later, she started feeling ""not good enough"", ""useless"", and ""desperate to feel happy again"". I was there for her and I tried to make her feel better, which was somewhat working in the long run.

Now to recent stuff; her father commited a well-planned suicide the day she graduated high school a few weeks ago. Of course, she feels lost and sad, which is absolutely ok in my opinion. What I am more worried of is that she'll get stuck in the self-pity phase again for a long time. We have been moving to a flat recently, so there wasn't a lot of space to talk this  through.

As her boyfriend, I am here to give her the emotional support, but we always fought the self-pity with logical arguments and positive views, which I feel is not an option right now. So my question is; what role should I play in this situation? I feel like I can do so much more than just give her a shoulder to cry on.

122,"I just had my birthday a few days ago, they tried to throw me a surprise birthday party. When I knew about it, I refused to celebrate it because I just really didn't like it. My mum tried to guilt trip me into celebrating it by crying so I just went ahead and stand there while they sing me the song. After cutting the cake, I went back into my room pissed off because once again I'm forced to do something because it's for my mum.

But after thinking for a while, I've come to realisation that maybe I'm the problem here. I'm not like your typical male in his early 20s where you don't give a fuck on what others say. Everyone seems to enjoy the company of others that are family at times like this but I don't, I'd rather be left alone. I used to be those that always have a positive mind for everything because I've always think that everything should be looked at from different perspectives. But now, I can only look at stuff negatively, even things that are good looks bad for me. All of this is just getting me a step closer to stop thinking for good.

Im 17F and have usually been a very emotional person.  All through high school I would be the first person to cry during a movie, and I’d always empathize with others. Then, 2020 hit. My mental health began to crumble and I was diagnosed with Pure O OCD. My OCD obsession is that I fully believe that I might be a sociopath. I‘ve had good weeks and bad weeks since January, but this obsession has stemmed from my recent lack of emotion. For some reason, I feel like my emotions have turned themselves off. I don’t feel sad. I don’t feel happy. I don’t feel empathy for others. Hell, I don’t even feel fear anymore. 

My therapist attributes this feeling to depression, which I disagree with. I have been depressed before, and this is not how I experienced it in the past. I dont experience the typical symptoms of depression like loss of appetite (although food has lost its taste now) and trouble sleeping. I feel myself pulling away from friends, though. 

Today was really hard. I went to my best friends house for a fourth of July party after spending the day with my baby cousins and family, and we were all watching the fireworks. I looked around and thought about my friends and family and the beautiful fireworks and just how great my life is. I come from a great family in a fairly well off neighborhood, have great friends, and am really smart. Even with all of these great things, I felt nothing. I was so empty and alone.

I guess my question is how do I bring up lost emotions again? Could I have turned into a sociopath? Everyone Ive asked for reassurance from says no, but I don’t know what caused this complete shut off of emotion. Thanks for any and all advice, and Im happy to answer more questions.",05Jul2020,1

128,"Roughest time of my life. Difficult situation with my son spiraled out of control over the year, the panic and frustration consumed my entire self. I fell in love, hard, with a man I had liked for a very long time but insecurity and my impending melt down quickly made sure that failed too. It all came to an explosive crescendo about 6 weeks ago. I had a full on breakdown, for the first time in my 40 years alive. I've always been able to keep everything together and just make things work but the more I held on to trying to keep my son and my life together the harder it fell apart. But! I cried it all out and surrendered to it all then... I got up. Admitted to needing some help. Got some help. Reassessed my priorities. Shut out the noise. Went away. Searched my soul for me. Got outside. Did things that relaxed me. Remembered I loved to laugh... so I laughed, at all sorts of things, mostly the irony of myself. Lost some weight. Got a tan. Liked what I saw in the mirror again and I'm on my way to climbing out of that hole. Never ever would I have imagined that absolutely falling apart would have made the load so much lighter.

129,"I just want to preface this by saying I’m not gonna kill myself anytime soon. I just really really want to.

One of my problems is that I have a really hard time opening up to anyone about any of my problems, especially family. I just know that if I tell them any problem I’m having that’s what they’re gonna think of anytime they think of me. I just keep up an image of a guy who really doesn’t care about anything and is always looking on the bright side, even though that couldn’t be further from the truth. 

I’m 16, so I still live at home with my parents, which means I have to go through them to get any mental health services. Earlier this year, things finally got so bad that I asked my parents to see a therapist, by saying it was because of stress at school. I already could barely stand telling my parents this, but then it got so much worse. I made the mistake of telling my therapist I was cutting, and then he told my parents. And now they know I’m a cutter, and now I know they think of me as a cutter. After they found out, I could barely talk to them anymore and I because a lot more withdrawn. I couldn’t stand being around them, because I knew what they were thinking. 

It got bad enough that I told my therapist I might try to kill myself, and he sent me to a psych ward. It was absolute hell. Now my parents think of me as a psych patient. And now I know every time my parents see me they see a psych patient. Each time they visited me I could barely talk to them, it hurt like red hot fire. When I got discharged I guess they realized I really didn’t want to talk about this anymore so they didn’t bring it up. But I know they’re still thinking about it. I know every time I see them. I’ve managed to keep up the charade of being happy, playing it off as a miraculous recovery and I’m 100% fine now for sure. But I know they know that’s not the case. I know they’re still thinking of me like that. I know they know I’m lying.

But now my birthday is coming up, and our family has a tradition of talking about everything going on in the past year. I’m dreading this, because even if they don’t mention it, I know for sure they’re going to be thinking about what happened to me. And I know it’s gonna be absolute hell to me. And I can’t tell them that I can’t do it this year, because then they’re gonna need a reason. And I can’t give them a reason because that’s even worse. I just wish I never had to see them or anyone who knows anything about me ever again. I wish I could just die. But I can’t. I don’t know what to do. Every option hurts too much. I’ve stuck bandaid over bandaid on all my problems and they’re so dangerously close to bursting off. What do I do? 

I don’t know why I care about this stuff so much, but I do. Anyone I’m close to knowing any problem I’m having quite literally worse than death. I just hate it so much, and it’s preventing me from doing so much. What do I do?",05Jul2020,1
130,Personally idk what I have best diagnosis I’ve had is drug induced psychosis and they didn’t know half the shit I was going through all I really want to know does anyone else think there life is a video game when I guess whatever you’d call it starts acting up doesn’t happen anymore and would only happen when I did drugs mostly weed but when I use to smoke it’d turn my life into a giant video game where people would either be against you pushing you farther into hell or people who wanted to help you who would try to tell you what you had to do all hidden messages but they’d always switch up and I’d think my family was vampires that would be killing my soul when this happened my vision would turn green this might be a bit everywhere but if anyone’s had anything like this mostly life’s a big video game which has no end might I add no matter how close you got to completing it you’d always have to do something else I know this post is probably everywhere like I was saying but if anyone can relate lmk,05Jul2020,1
131,For a couple months or so I’ve been feeling weird. I feel incredibly sad sometimes and I feel like my body is in so much pain. I feel scared and lonely. I feel like I’m doing this alone. I have loving friends and family but I feel like I can’t talk to anyone. It’s 3am and I just finished crying in the bathroom. I have small thoughts of suicide but it’s something I’ll never do even if I really want to. But if there’d be a way to erase myself from existence without hurting anybody I would. Sometimes I start breathing really fast and my face and limbs go numb and I get dizzy. But I don’t get why I feel sad sometimes. It’s just sometimes I feel so happy. Especially when I’m listening to music or being with my family. Today we all watched the fireworks from our window and it was pretty cool. I’m an extrovert and I love being with people.

133,"I’m having a hard time working out what to do with my life. Today I spent most of the day feeling down thinking about how my degree in psychology is practically useless where I live because I chose it with the dream of going into research which is just not practical given I live in a very small country town with no research facilities. My partners sister rang her and was talking about how she was thinking about changing careers to a job I always thought might be a backup for me and she’s in no way qualified or experienced but still talking to them and may well do a short course and get a job and it made me realise that I’m putting all my energy into academia not only because I do genuinely enjoy learning but because I can do it from home and my anxiety is so bad I have been unable to hold down a job for over two years now. 

This is confounded by the fact that I’m in the process of being diagnosed with epilepsy and haven’t been allowed to drive and also that I’ve been recovering from anorexia (after ten years) but honestly it’s not these things that really hold me back it’s my anxiety and it’s so bad that I can’t be around people too long, I can’t sleep at someone else’s house and I can’t have anyone sleep at ours, I can’t catch up with people without my partner and when we do I am highly anxious and the activities have to be short, not involve food, and have a way for me to quickly get away. 

Antidepressants have never worked for me. I buy the self help books, see my psych, do meditations, buy anxiety apps, try to exercise more etc etc. 
I’m still afraid of life. I don’t know how to fix it. My life would be substantially better if I wasn’t so anxious and could socialise and connect with people, leave the house to pursue hobbies without a safe person (I love photography and videography), and work a job that would allow me to feel like a functioning contributing member of society (literally any job). 
My partner tries to reassure me that I do very well at uni but none of that means anything. At the rate I’m going I just see myself being someone with a lot of knowledge with no ability to apply it in any meaningful way.

I’ve tried to seek help both professionally and personally, and unfortunately I haven’t had a breakthrough.

As a black woman, I find it rather discouraging to talk about mental health because those around me are consumed with the idea that black people aren’t mentally ill and that it’s a “white trait” and I think everyone on this thread white, black, or other etc. can attest that’s not true. 

Every time I mention mental health and depression, I get met with “it’s all in your head,” or “toughen up,
life sucks”, or the most famous line as well as obnoxious “just pray about it”. It’s extremely agonizing to hear those responses and they have no clue about your suicide attempts, sleepless nights, self-harm episodes, or how a boy almost twice your age, groomed you into a victim because he knew no one would listen.

142,"I'm a 21F and I have a tough time trying to keep friends. I won't go into too much detail since that would take to long (unless you want to know). But, growing up I had very few genuine friends. In elementary school, I had a friend who was jealous of me, she would talk about me behind my back and even gaslighted my best friend about me and another one who would put me down constantly. Middle school, I had a falling out with a close friend every year because of bs or because they betrayed my trust or me as a person. The worst year was 7th grade. Before I moved, I was friends with a group of boys and I started dating one of them and one of the guys started bullying me relentlessly until I moved. Then that summer when I made friends at my new school, one of my friends let my other friend who I had a falling out with go off on me via text. 9th grade, two of my friends became closer with each other and ultimately pushed me out of the group (I believe it was unintentionally though because I don't have ill feelings about them) and another friend started ignoring me out of nowhere. The rest of high school was me having school friends except for maybe three. I'm still friends with them, but casually. 

I'm 21 now, and I'm scared to make new friends and get close to people because I'm afraid they're gonna either a) get sick of me eventually b) abandon me or 3) tell people personal things about me like my old friends. I know it's silly, but it's a legit fear I have. My childhood friends broke my heart and I don't want to go through that again. But I so desperately want a best friend again. And honestly, its even affected me trying to date. I do want a boyfriend, but intimacy freaks me out. My mom always talks about me not having any friends or not dating and it hurts me because I want friends, but I'm afraid to make friends and I don't think I could talk to my parents about it because we're black and black people are kind of dismissive when it comes to mental health.

144,"*DISCLAIMER*: I have no actual degree or any formal education in psychology, only a personal enjoyment for learning about it and mental health. I do not claim to have self diagnosed and I will be bringing it up with my medical professional.

I am 24, female, I've grown up having to deal with emotional neglect and abuse, divorced parents, one alcoholic parent and one workaholic. I've dealt with depression, both my own and my mums, I've looked after myself from teenage years and I've been looking for answers my whole life as to why I am the way that I am.

For the last (I wanna say) 8 or so years, whilst doing reading into the mental world, and talking with friends and others that have a diagnosis or experience in the area. I have long found a connection with the disorder of BPD (now called EUPD). All of the criteria seemed to make so much sense to me and I have since used that to explain my 'symptoms' to doctors.

So life happened blah blah blah, cut to a couple weeks ago when my ex-now-friend (who only recently received his own bpd diagnosis) informed me that he has also now been classified as autistic as well. Now firstly this is hilarious because all through our relationship he would joke that he thought I was the autistic one. He isn't the first person to think this either, a couple others have asked me if I have been checked for autism. 

Now, I have done minimum research on the subject in the past, I guess I didn't want to think about him and the others being right. However after my ex telling me this, I had that feeling in my mind and my gut that there was something here that struck a cord in me. 

The fucker was right after all. I've spent an hour going through different medical sites building a solid list of signs for autistic girls and i went into shutdown mode because it freaked me out at how fucking accurate it is!!!

I very likely have autism and it makes so much sense.

But I now think that no one will believe me because I've been so intent on finding an answer, I know people are gonna think that its just my new obsession for the week or whatever (thats an exaggeration, I'm not that bad)

147,"I'm not really sure how else to put it, but as of late every single day I get out of bed my judgement feels more clouded and I feel like I can't focus on what's important around me, like family and friends and it's gotten to the point I have no idea what to do. 
The reason I feel like I'm at such a loss is because I was totally miserable my entire senior year, and after a lot of talking it out and through some perseverance I finally left what was the darkest place I've ever been in, lost 25kg, got accepted into University, made a bit of money with my investments, but ever since I just feel like I can't get as good of a mental handle on things like I used to.
Not to sound conceited but I've always had naturally good reflexes and a knack for being quick on the uptake and I've noticed that I'm not just slower, but I'm straight up not reacting to things anymore, from simple things like catching an item that I'd dropped, to way more severe things like not reacting at all to the fact my car hydroplaned and I crashed off the road with my best friend in the car (Both OK luckily,[minor crash](http://imgur.com/a/NMOkH2N), write off sadly). And it f*cked me up, half a cars length away from killing either myself or my best mate and that's when this shitty cloudy, dissociative feeling started setting in worse each day.
And it's just starting to make me feel like something broke in me and there's a serious underlying issue. I'm not even sure how I'd approach a professional on this either, I just feel defeated and really dont want to get stuck in the spiral again but the more I feel like I've dissociated the worse I feel, it's like I'm losing touch with myself. It feels like I get through every day on muscle memory alone and that I haven't thought/been consciously aware of a single thing I've done all day.
I'm sorry if this isn't very cohesive or detailed, I've come up with nothing over the last few weeks of thinking about this and figured it might help to have someone else understand or even know what might be going on, because Headspace doesn't seem to know nor be able to help.",05Jul2020,1

If I was a lazy ass hole would I have graduated with a 1st? If I was a lazy ass hole would I be working all the hours I can get to fund my post grad next year? If I was a lazy ass hole would I have chosen a creative degree knowing the amount of passion and effort I would have to have in order to be successful in that career?


People see what they want to see, they see a graduate working in a ""lowly"" job and they are happy because it makes them feel less insecure about their own failures.

And that pursuit doesn't end after graduating, most people don't just walk into grad jobs even with a high grade degree. There's voluntary work, internships and post grad study and years of working in ""lowly"" jobs in order to fund these next steps.

Alright, let's get started.

As I am writing this things are coming to mind so my writing may deteriorate, but I will try my best to explain how I feel, think, and act on a daily basis.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many things I think about, how my mind works and how I act. But there isn't any other trait so common in my mind: A lack of understanding one's emotions, actions or thoughts. And to an extreme, I see people who cannot process what I say or how I think as completely beneath me. I see these people as nothing but inferior, likes ants to a giant. I cannot understand why so many people commit vile acts, or what I perceive as ""not normal."" or ""contradictory."" I believe that nobody can be trusted, that everything is a game to people.

Another trait that I see in myself is seeking validity (of course, that becomes rather apparent with my post) but it's in my way a cry to be noticed, to be accepted and looked as someone of worth. I don't seek attention, I seek to be noticed.

Ithink I will stop this here, there are many other traits about me that I would like to share but I don't want to give a heartfelt written wall of text only to be ignored due to it's length.

Hello, 

So the past week or so hasn't been great at all. But I'm doing a bit better now. I woke up last Tuesday with this strange feeling in my left arm and a ton of anxiety. It has this persistant feeling of weakness, pain that comes and goes, and this very odd sensation that it feels foreign? I also feel a small part of the foreign feeling in my left leg. The intensity of the symptoms changes with my anxiety and over the course of the day but that foreigness still seems to be persistant and annoying. I know logically it's mine but it doesn't have the same 'correct' feeling that my other arm does.

Of course as I keep getting older, I'm collecting more-and-more letters after my name. GAD, OCD, DPDR. And I have an odd feeling that I'll be collecting 'FND' after mine as well. I've talked to my Therapist about it, and she said to rule out any physical injuries that might be manifesting anxiety first and to go from there. Thankfully if it is FND, it's treatable, but I do have an MRI coming up that'll decide which path I'll take for treatment.

I just wanted any one else's input on what's going on.

Thanks,",05Jul2020,1
165,"Hello, I've been mentally ill for more than 10 years and got a few different diagnosis from psychiatrists which made me question what I really suffer from. When I first saw a specialist, I was surrounded by people who told me not to take medication, that I didn't need them etc. I listened to that advice and stayed away from them until almost 3 years ago now. In hindsight I wish I started immediatly.I'm now on Sertraline (morning) and Trazodone (at night), and it has helped me quite a bit. Things are still far from perfect though, and a few secondary effects of the drugs are very tough sometimes.The thing I noticed since I take the drugs is a 'cycle' in my energy. I realized this is happening ever since I started suffering from mental illness, it's just more clear now. I will feel ok to good for around week sometimes more and all of sudden I'll have insomnia and no energy during the day. I will feel very depressed with apparently no reason for a few days then my energy will pick up again. Until the next drop... .Does that mean I suffer from bipolar disorder?I'd like to maybe try another treatment but I'm not sure I wanna trust another psychiatrist from my area since their diagnosis differ so much and I've been prescribed different drugs aswell ...

I'm trying to remove the habit of negative emotions. This has nothing to do with being in a bad mood. It's a skill to decipher which negative emotions are a result of my current situation, alerting me to take action, and what negative emotions are a result of addiction to feeling negative. 

Resources I have are, I'm in a community of over a hundred people, and my job has about a thousand people. I am naturally very high on the social hierarchy. So I receive allot of subconscious feedback that I'm valuable. 

The main discipline is in evoking a meditative transe of not thinking while I work. I'm working 70hrs a week and my job doesn't require any complex intellectual analyzation. I'm putting chickens on an assembly line in a factory.

It pays more than anything else I can do right now and I just need to shut my brain down and sleep walk while I save money. 

This is a habit that I'm focusing on intensely for the next six months. Not as a permanent habitual state, but as an exercise to gain ability. 

By new years I'll have a job on customer service and I'll be going out most nights, so I won't even need this ability as it's own coping mechanism. 

Allot of the discipline is that, in six months my life will be awesome; however, whatever my emotional base is now, will be my emotional base in six months. If I'm always in a negative mood because I feel my life isn't fair, then in six months, when my life is awesome, it won't matter because I'll still have a negative perception in life. 

I need to adopt the attitude that will create abundance then, now. And I need to shut down all feelings of despair, victimhood, tragedy, and self pity. Cause in the scheme of things, I'm really in good shape. 

Three concepts I steal from religion (as I'm atheist) are the ability to surrender to a universe that is beyond my control (Christianity), acceptance that what ever fortune or tragedy I might experience in life, there will always be loneliness and suffering because that's just life (Buddhism) and that I need to trust my natural instinct as my best judgment, free of the limiting beliefs created my trauma I've experienced (Taoism). 

Anyways, that's my focus and my six month goal of daily discipline. No one is ever in control of my emotions. That is something I chose. And before I can reep the rewards of my abundance in life, my emotional state must be based internally as a reflection of who I am, and not a result of temporary situations that I might be in that I have no control over.",05Jul2020,1
172,"Hi. I just need to vent as I can’t in to see my psychologist as it’s the middle of the night and I can’t talk to my family. 

So, tonight at around 9:30, I was on my way to dropping a friend home when we came across a car that had hopped a round a bout and two cars with hazard lights on. I being a trained first aid personnel pulled over to check if everything was okay. Lucky I did because no one else on scene was first aid trained. Unfortunately the driver who had jumped the curb had apparently not remembered doing this and their head was hurting quite bad. I remained calm and I communicated with the people on site, told her to not move or get out of her car as there was no sign of danger, and called the ambos. 

I relayed all the information to them while having someone keep her calm. We were close to the police stations anyway, a one minute drive, so a cop turned up in about three minutes after the call. The ambos then arrived with two more cop cars. We gave them all the information we knew and was told by the ambos and coppas that I did everything exactly to how it should be done, that my first aid training had paid off and I executed it perfectly. 

I dropped my friend off, and talked to her parents about what had happened and why we were late. I told her and her parents to watch herself for the next few days and to talk to someone if they need to. After dropping my friend off, the shock of everything started to hit me. I called my young adults pastor and just told him what had happened (as we had just left from a young adults event) and that we both were safe. 

Now that I am home, I can’t stop thinking about the accident. I know I did everything correctly, but I feel terrible still, like I’m guilty somehow. I’m all fidgety, anxious, been having spouts of panic, small crying episodes, dizzy, faint when standing, and my movements are all jerky. I keep seeing the flashing lights of blue and red cop cars and ambulances. 

I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and RAD (reactive attachment disorder) in the past two months and my depression and anxiety had mostly cleared up with the help of therapy. But now I don’t know what to do. From tomorrow I will be living out of home and I’m supposed to be helping the rest of my family move out of the house tomorrow. I can’t sleep. I take melatonin for my sleep anyway but even though I feel tired I can’t sleep.

I know I'll meet a lot of coworkers like her, but I hate it so much. Other days I can work perfectly fine, but when she starts, it hurts so much. I don't know why, either.

Still do I find myself constantly checking up on that person by checking all of the photos, checking which photos this person has liked and so on...

I always was the invisible person , no matter what I say , or look like , I was never noticed to be even there ... I have a hobby that i wish i could do full time and I need an audience which I never had or could have .  
back in my school days , the class used to make events where for example in valentine everyone comes in red , and they announced it on the school group chat which no one added me to . For 2 full years . I was the only one who didn't come in red because I didn't know...  


I might be not charismatic , but I have never found one person willing to start a conversation with me .  
I am always starting the conversation , doing things , I attempt a lot of things and I even did wire sliding and stuff like that from high altitudes so I am really open to anything and  everyone and I don't really judge people , and give my opinion straight away .  


But when I do I am often ignored ... I am even registered as absent in some of the classes I attended ...  
and the DR. lost my test more than once , I have been very self conscious as to why I cannot be noticed...   
tbh I am more on the listening side socially but if there is something i am interested in I'll talk about it ...  
Recently in the lockdown I have been feeling a little lonely  , since I love interacting with people and I don't like that lingering feeling of loneliness , I started a YouTube channel about going around and talking to people in Vrchat , I absolutely love doing this , I  don't even feel like  recording and it helps me cope with my loneliness and the acquired feeling that I have deep inside me that I am unwanted .   


But , again , I failed to be noticed , I love to draw too and I have been trying to share my stuff with people and not having anyone to talk to about that specific thing I did a fanart of , and the videos viewed by 1 or 2 people , makes me lose my confidence , that my whole "" not being noticed thing "" doesn't require me being physically  there . It is online as well ...  


I also failed my last interview... Why ....? when I called back they forgot who I was and didn't even replied back till I called.   
Dark thoughts have been in my mind more and more recently as to why I always have to take the initiative and still remain invisible ...I am tired of being lonely  and unwanted .  
I don't want "" attention "" and "" all eyes on me "" I just want for anybody to think that I am worth being here , that I matter and that my hard work is not ignored ...

 About seven years ago, when I was 13, my brother had a severe mental breakdown. Out of nowhere, he threw a tantrum, got aggressive and attacked my mom. My dad tried to stop him and the fight got physical. But luckily nobody was hurt. I remember throwing up from being so terrified because I've never seen him like that. Things seemed to calm down for a while. Until that night he tried to attack mom again. Dad stopped him and mom told me to stay in my room. I couldn't sleep that night and was crying the whole time.

Over the next few months, my parents tried their best to get help. It was incredibly hard to get him to leave the house to visit the hospital. He was put on medication. But fights would happen from time to time. Every time, I would walk into the bedroom, close the door turn off the lights and sit there, waiting for it to end. I grew up introverted, but I never really had the habit of staying in a room all day. But after that incident, I barely left my room and preferred to stay inside for most of my time at home. We moved to our new house when I was 15 and I finally got my own upstairs bedroom. My brother was still not doing well and I would often hear him yelling and knocking things over from downstairs. I got used to it, to a point I would just ignore it. 

 However, when I was 17, my dad and brother were away for a month or so for his treatment. I was about to fall asleep when I heard my brother yelling. This caught my attention because I knew he wasn't home. I looked around the house just in case he was back home or something but he wasn't. I kept hearing things throughout the month and I still hear them, to this day.The only reason I noticed it at the time was because he wasn't home. It mostly happens at night or when it is silent. It was weird because my parents kept telling me that he was doing better and I wouldn't believe them because I could 'hear' him all the time. I doubt if all of the times, at least the majority of the times I heard things were just in my head. I used to have a lot of nightmares at the beginning but not much anymore.

On the bright side, my brother is doing a lot better. The outbursts are very less frequent now. Also, the amount of medication he has to take is slowly tapering. What worries me is that I still hear these things. They make me panic even though I'm completely aware that he is doing well. It's causing me difficulties to fall asleep because everytime I hear something, it forces me to think about the horrible times. I felt the need to ask this because yesterday, I heard what sounded like a commotion and jumped out of bed but the house was silent. I really don't know what to do about this. Should I seek help or will it just go away as my brother recovers?",05Jul2020,1

So, he had every right to come in.

However, ever since that incident, I have not been able to sleep well. I get 4-5 hours a day and have been for the past few months. Every morning, I wake up in terror and often get panic attacks terrified he's there. I'll hear the softest thud or sounds from my neighbour and think it's him and get extremely anxious.

It's what has taken those good qualities places anyway. I think I miss the old me... Biggest reason I came here was due to my overbearing father. I had escaped by moving away 1000km from the Prairies in hopes of a better life. It has been good. Been here for 7 years. It's been a good experience but it hasn't but so great lately. Looking back I was better growth wise... I've never been good at socializing so I've decided that geography doesn't change that after 7 years. I think I've just accepted this now.... Idk. Reason why I've spewed all this out is somehow this wraps back around to me wondering what I should be doing. My roomates aren't the growth type of people where as I am. They are simply social butterflies amongst parties. Nothing more... Financials play a massive role here in my conundrum.,05Jul2020,1
186,"I was diagnosed with depression and GAD about 4 months ago and at first I easily accepted it, like it explained a huge part of me and my personality. But now I'm having issues coming to terms with it. I know that they're pretty common and a lot of people have it, but I can't help but think that I'm messed up in the brains. I have to keep reminding myself that it's not something that happened overnight and I've been living with this for years, even before I was diagnosed when I thought I was ""normal."" The self that I thought was normal was me still with these problems but now whenever I have  anxiety attack or think about death I feel like it's something abnormal and external that's just not myself. On one hand I want to treat it like a disease, like diabetes, but on the other hand it's pretty much defined who I am and how I've been living life so far.",05Jul2020,2
187,"**TW for talk of suicidal ideation and self harm**  


Hi y'all. This is part vent, part plea for advice. I need to write everything down somewhere to clear my head a little, and I don't want to burden my friends with it any more. 

So, my partner is relapsing again. Sometimes this lasts a week or less, sometimes it lasts months. They've been depressed and on/off suicidal since they were a young teenager, and nobody they've sought help from in the past has ever really helped. Their family doesn't even attempt to understand, their doctor has refused them help because they're ""okay"" despite them going to him several times, years apart, and reporting the same problems each time, and they don't really have anyone else to turn to. 

We've made some progress together in that they have a counsellor now, and have an upcoming appointment to get assessed for adhd and/or asd, which I think would really help them get the support they need elsewhere - but they still don't have anyone close in their life that they trust other than me when it comes to the really personal stuff (me being 11,000 miles away. Yeah.) 

During these relapses they tend to post vents about how they should just kill themself, how they would if they weren't a 'coward', that nobody would notice and that nobody cares. They tend to go non-verbal during these periods, only communicating through typing. They usually manage to refrain from cutting or anything to that degree, but in substitute they hit themself repeatedly until they physically can't any more. 

I've been in a call with them since late January, either of us only leaving if we have to go somewhere - and even then, we usually message one another in between. This began because they had a relapse and got the closest they have to an actual attempt since I've been with them. I talked them down, and I didn't want them to be alone (part of me was also too scared to) so I just never hung up again after that. Don't get me wrong, it's not *constant*, they have times when they're doing really well too, where they get excitable and loud and in really good spirits, but it's only so long between minor events triggering them and sending them back into a downwards spiral.

I love them so, so much. They mean the world to me. We've planned out our entire future together, and they've told me before I'm the one person that's stopping them from identifying as aromantic, which they did for years before they met me. It tears me apart to see them this low, to have to hear them hitting themself, reading how they think nobody would notice if they died. I wish I could just make all of the badness go away and fix everything for them. But looking after them has been getting to me. 

I completely refuse to take time away from them - I'm *not* leaving them completely alone, especially when I know I'm one of the only things that comforts them - but lately I've been staying in bed all morning, staying quiet as if I was asleep, so they have the comfort of my presence but I don't risk saying something that could upset them. I've been taking as little time away from my room as I can in case they wake up in the night and need me, and I've been in floods of tears nearly every time I talk to them the past couple days. I want to support them, I want to be everything they need, but I can't, and even that's getting to me. I feel like I'm failing them, like everyone else has. I just feel so tired and so powerless and so isolated in that I can't just keep coming to people to vent about it, but it's really the only thing on my mind. They're my best friend and really my only friend that I feel close enough to that I can talk to them daily about anything and feel normal and comfortable with it, so when they're getting bad, especially when they're getting non-verbal, I can't help but feel completely alone.

We're seeking help, together. I promised them I'd make sure *someone* listens to them eventually. The problem is that I am not a professional, I am a barely-adult on the opposite side of the world from them who is also mentally ill. I know they don't expect me to take care of them in that way - sometimes they don't even *want* me to, because they feel like they're just bothering me and that it ""won't be worth it"" - but it just feels like my responsibility. Nobody else is going to do it, and they aren't well enough to do it for themselves yet.

I can't talk about this with them. At least, not when they're in this relapse. I know they'll get back to normal, and probably soon, but even then I don't like to bring up stuff about their emotional issues because talking about that could trigger them into another low. They also tend to avoid me if they feel like they're being a bother or a problem, hanging up and ghosting me for days at a time before caving after I beg them to come back because they're not any sort of problem and I want to keep them safe and provide them a sense of comfort. I'm just so, so tired. I know they are as well, and I feel selfish saying it about myself, but I feel far too deeply for my own good and it's emotionally exhausting to worry about them this much.

Just... what do I do? If anyone reading this (and it's way longer than I intended it to be, which I really apologise for, but thank you for reading all of it) has been in a position either like mine or like my partner's, I'd really, really appreciate some advice. What else I could do to help them, or what I can do to take care of myself. They're the love of my life, and I promised them we'll be so happy in our own little home together one day, but that's still quite a ways away, and I want to keep both of us relatively intact until we can actually get it done.",05Jul2020,1
188,"I'm fortunately mentally fine for the most part, but some problems with myself such as almost complete lack of confidence make me look up mental advice on google from time to time and it's all written to be encouraging and stuff, but for some reason I take it the other way around.

Could it be that I am trying to avoid the problem and that looking up advice is equal to facing the fear and then running away?",05Jul2020,1
189,"Hello all, 
  I want to keep this brief as possible. Me and my wife have been bad communicators for a while and so I had a lot to say about how her depression has impacted me but also how our lack of intimacy has impacted me. Well, In my poor judgment I took her lack of sexual desire to heart and I emotionally cheated. I did however admit this, put no blame on her for that specifically , while also still telling my story and admitting to my pains. So we talked after she read everything I had to say and I feel like we grew a little closer, but.... I also feel ... I don’t know . More stressed ? I can’t tell exactly . Maybe it’s me trying to process things , maybe it’s me trying to undo years of assuming things about her that I’m changing ? I can’t say for sure. I just know that I feel nearly consumed by it even though we worked out our issues I’d say in an adult manner and we talked about couples therapy.

I reached out to a support group I'm in and I was contacted by a therapist who's helping me for free. I just wanted to share this as it truly touched me as I didn't think I was going to get help.

It creeps me out that I can't see myself old. But I also never wanted to be old anyway so I guess thats ok. But idk how long I'll be able to last. I have bittersweet feelings about being alive because I sort of wanna die but also don't. I just hate living *this* existence, but nothing ever changes, no matter how much I change myself, because the world around me gets crazier, or stays the same. It fluctuates.

It got me upset thinking that maybe I'll die one day and be forgotten like everyone else. I wanted to at least be famous, so I'll be remembered and loved years later. But now I'm 14, and I'm honestly saying that I have a greater understanding of death and that I might not want to live forever. Not because, ""Oh well everyone you love will die before you!"" but because life is very tiring and hurtful and repetitive. I don't think I'm suicidal?

Whenever I put my playlist on it is never this loud, and it's songs that I already know every beat to. (I must add that when listening to a new song or album from an artist I already like I play it super soft at first, or it's annoying.) 

Her music is not something I dislike, we both have diverse tastes. Still, it seems to paralize me. Focusing is harder than usual and I tend to dissociate faster and for longer periods of time, even on meds. It's like my whole brain is covered in jelly and it even brings physical discomfort.

199,"I feel like there is a Jekyll and Hyde inside of me, if you asked me why I wanted to die yesterday I literally would not be able to explain it or understand myself, it’s only when I get into that mindset again that it all comes rushing back, and it works the opposite way so when I feel upset I don’t understand how I could have felt happy the day prior or any other day in my life. 

I get obsessed over small things until it tumbles out of control and becomes a big thing that consumes me for several days at least. I work myself into such a state until I get to a certain point, and then it’s like a switch has gone off and I suddenly don’t feel anything at all and when that happens I just feel this wall getting built thicker and thicker between me and living a healthy life. 

I feel negative emotions (jealousy, anger, sadness, irritation, guilt) so easily and so intensely and the good emotions don’t come half as much. It’s especially bad in my relationships, particularly romantic. Even now as I’ve finished writing it became hard to articulate why I started or what point I meant to make because I just feel nothing. 

I don’t know what to do, I want to reach out to a professional but I’m scared that if they catch me on a good day I wouldn’t even be able to explain how bad I can get and I’d just get dismissed and embarrass myself in the process. 

I don’t feel like I could tell my family if I got a diagnosis or spoke to someone, I’m not quite sure why I feel that way. I think it’s because they all have a host of mental illnesses and kind of gate-keep it whilst I’m meant to be the happy healthy one. 
I thought I had friends to talk to but they’re really my boyfriend’s group and I’m just a cling on (I found this out yesterday). I’m an army baby so moving posts every 2-3 years means I never learnt the ability to make solid long term friends.

We don’t really talk, this may seem dumb but it’s like we talk telepathically! I “talked” about how I was feeling to her and she said that I was a good person with a charming personality! It’s like having a therapist. She also watches me draw and says nice things about what I’m drawing.

i know i have self esteem issues, i find it almost impossible to accept compliments a lot of the time. don’t get me wrong. hearing someone compliment me makes me so happy. “they thought positively of me. f* yeah.” but in my heart and head i sincerely can’t accept the compliment. i don’t believe what they say at all. “thank you”s are easy for me to accept. it means i did something that made the other person happy. i’m ok with that. 

even if my close friend tells me i’m a good person, i laugh it off. i say “nah”. one of my close friends told me she actually looked up to me and i was really surprised. not even like pleasantly, i was just “what? lol why?” kind of. even when my bf told me i was cute, some part of me said, “he’s just saying that because he’s with you. don’t even think that he means 1% of what he just said”.

206,"I'm 22, since I was 17 I've worked with 8 counsellors/therapists, I only enjoyed working with one of them. After 16 weeks (16 hours) I was discharged, the company told me I'd have to get a new diagnosis to reapply and then would have to wait months and after that there would be a tiny chance I'd be able to work with the same therapist again. This was around a year ago, I haven't received any treatment since.

I don't even know what to say anymore, since my girlfriend left (almost 2 years ago), I've had nothing to live for. I was very mentally ill when I was with her, I can't imagine what I put her through, but she gave me a reason to get better, I was doing it for us. I don't really know how to do things for me. 

I've been suicidal since I was around 12, I first tried when I was 16. My life has been full of betrayal, infidelity, deception. Mum cheated on dad and both my girlfriends cheated on me. Once dad was single he would ALWAYS have \~7 girlfriends, none of which knew about eachother. 

I've spent the last 4 years living in a big city but I couldn't take being alone anymore, so I'm back with my mum, temporarily. But if anything, I feel worse. Now I have people around, and still I feel completely trapped in my own mind. 

Everytime I think about the next step I think about how useless doctors have been in the past, I need to REALLY know what's wrong with me. At different times I've been diagnosed with: Depression, bipolar disorder, GAD, SAD, OCD, anorexia and CPTSD, all within the past 3 years. I don't even know what I'm trying to make better, there's just no way there's that much shit wrong with me. I have some fucking deep rooted issues and the task of finding someone that genuinely wants to make that better is too much for me now, I've been letdown too many times, I'm afraid the next time will be the end. 

I have no friends I see in real life, because I have no personality. My personality has become a collection of my various possible mental illnesses and the various things I've learned about how to treat them, I just have nothing to offer. No passion, no desire, I definitely would NOT want to be friends with me, I'm not a bad guy, I'm just fucking boring. The things I really love are video games, maths and psychology/helping other people, but they're fading really quickly.

Byron (Reckful) gave me really a lot of inspiration and hope, I could relate a lot to him. The way he was trapped in his own mind, his requirement for constant reassurance, his unquenchable desire to be around people he loves all the time. His path to recovery lit a real fire in me, it made me really determined to also get better, to be in a place where I was healthy enough to acquire those people I love and that love me back, to live a life where I have a purpose, to not perform the unthinkable act.

And now, after hearing the way Byron's friends spoke about him, how all they could really do is delay his death, how there was nothing they could do to stop it, how they all knew but knowing was worthless. I'm struggling to see another path for my life, I almost feel empowered, I feel no pain writing this because I want nothing more than to leave this plane of existence, to join Byron is his Everland.

I'm really fucking suffering from a huge amount of suicide ideation, I don't even feel sad, I just feel like it's already over. I'm not exaggerating when I say the only thing stopping me is my parents and my couple of friends, because I know these people really fucking love me and I don't want them to go through what Byron's friends are going through. 

I really need some sort of divine fucking intervention because I'mma fucking die. And even if my life is worthless I know my death will be fucking tragic for the people whose lives I am a part of. 

Please do not link me helpline numbers, they are all objectively dogshit help resources for me. I want to go to A&amp;E again, but I'm not emotional enough for them to take me seriously, I'm dead inside. Last time I don't think they would've taken me seriously if I didn't have fresh cuts everywhere. I'm not really sure where to take myself anymore, my mum doesn't understand mental health and my dad is very far away, and has dealt with far too much of my shit for far too long.

212,"Was this Narcissism? Another ex lover story.

Long story alert 🚨 

Around 5 years ago I met my now ex boyfriend. We met through an app, and our relationship bloomed very quickly. He was charming, charismatic, made me feel important and wanted. I was young, around 23, and within a month or two I was in love. He was attentive, made me feel like I was important to him. He would consistently check in with me when we were apart, we would spend every moment we could together, and started planning a more concrete future together. After a long period of this amazing relationship, he quickly went cold and eventually broke up with me because it was “getting too serious” and “he couldn’t be in a relationship” because he wanted to go to law school away and couldn’t be tied down. I was crushed and confused. Became depressed, ect. Eventually I moved on and started dating again but he was always in the back of my mind and nobody made me feel like him. 

A few months passed and he contacted me, saying he made a mistake and wanted to try again. I was so excited, young and dumb and quickly jumped on the offer, thinking that now things would be right. 

We met up after work, where he greeted me with a picnic along the river. We had a magical evening, watched the sun set, had wonderful conversation and ended up going home and spending the night together. Nothing sexual happened, as I wanted to take it slow. He ended up spending the entire weekend with me. I recently moved into an apartment and didn’t have it fully furnished, so he took me to buy furniture and purchased it for me. I thought this must be a sign he really cared and wanted to invest in me, ect. Two weeks later he went cold again and said he couldn’t be in a relationship. I was crushed, again. 

Four years and a new apartment later, after no contact due to me blocking him on every social media/dating/possible contact point-my phone was stolen from me. I got a new phone, downloaded new apps and bam. He finds me and strikes up conversation. When I saw this contact, I was sick to my stomach and ready to throw up. 

He contacts me saying that he couldn’t believe that he found me, that he wanted to make amends. He invited me for coffee, to talk, my first reaction was to reject, but after much convincing, I met up with him. He was charming, told me that he’s changed, that he always loved me and thought about me. That he wanted to be with me, and build a life together. I was initially very closed off and callous to his words, but after 4 weekly walks along the river and after answering all my tough questions, I caved in and decided I wanted to be with him. After all, I never stopped loving him. And he seemed to feel the same way. 

The first 11 months of us being together were normally great. Amazing times together, traveling, sparks, very strong sexual attraction and understanding of each other. We met each other’s families. I grew to love his family and my family grew to love him. He said he wanted to marry me, have children together, grow old together. At this point we were spending almost every night together. On a trip to San Francisco, he fake proposed to me three times in Muir Woods, thinking each time was funnier and funnier, seeing my reaction. 

Then hell broke loose. The criticism of everything I did, the constant belittlement, the degradation followed by resolution and affirmation that he “wasn’t going anywhere ever” and that we could work through all problems. This would repeat itself almost weekly. One memorable event was as follows: I was doing his laundry late in the evening after he had gone to bed. I decided to wash his underwear and socks, since they were dirty and he didn’t bring another pair. Since it was late, I forgot to put them into the dryer after they had finished and I went to bed. The next morning, frantically, I jumped out of bed remembering they hadn’t been dried and threw them into the dryer and jumped in the shower. After about 10 mins, they were mainly dry and he had woken up, and immediately noticed they were not 100% dried and took huge issue with this. He became cold, told me he couldn’t rely on me, ect. I offered a pair of my underwear and socks (were both men, btw) but he refused. We went to work and I was torn apart all day, scared and also very upset as I thought the situation was out of control. I called him at lunch where I apologized and demanded he apologize for telling me what he did and for making me feel belittled. He would not, became silent and withheld any real contact or apology/affirmation. This happened on many occasions and eventually got worse. On some occasion, he called me the “lowest of the low.” Then we’d work it out, or at least move beyond.

My dog, who I loved dearly, passed away. While crying and morning her loss, he became physically and visibly aroused. This happened any time I cried.

On our anniversary he sent me bouquets of flowers to work for three days in a row. For our anniversary, I planned a night out for us to commemorate. Nothing crazy, dinner and a movie downtown. He expressed distaste for everything. I chose the movie, he didn’t like it. I chose the restaurant, a highly rated French restaurant, he didn’t like it. He told me he wasn’t excited for our year together and was more excited about his “Friend anniversary” with one of his friends. I felt crushed but ignored it. More belittlement followed. 

It got to a point where I demanded we go to therapy together. We went once before he discredited the therapist, saying he didn’t have a “therapy license” hanging on the wall of the office so it must not be legit. I then demanded we both see separate therapists. 

More belittlement happened. More make ups happened, rinse/repeat. This went on for 3 months, before we reached the breaking point. I loved him, couldn’t imagine life without him, but was completely broken. 

I decided I wanted space, and decided we would meet once weekly to try and sort this out. I was never apologized to, cried harder than I ever did in my life, and begged to get reasoning for all of this from him. He was mainly cold and not understanding, but at one point, through tears muttered “there’s something wrong”, referring to himself. 

Not long after, we called it quits. I had no more to give and felt as if I lost all dignity and self worth. Was crushed by losing him. Depressed for months. Now, 10 months later, I’m better but not completely healed. I never want him back, but the scar is still there and fading slowly.

213,"Hi! Id like to refer to myself as Misery, and Ive been having this question for quite a while now. So basically, when I think of myself, its not just „me“ theres 3 other people, they kinda influence my mood/behavior I guess? I seemed to have made them up a while ago. I don’t remember when. They kinda just started existing at some point and I went „aight so that exists now“ lol. Uh, its one girl and two boys. One of the boys is really mean towards me. He looks similar to me and seems to think emotions are a waste of time. That I should go numb, harm myself and starve. The others HATE him. They are kinda comfort characters I guess? I know I made them up but now I can’t seem to stop thinking about them. They have distinct personalities and when I see certain things I „react“ like I am one of them. I frequently talk to them in dreams too. I draw them. Have conversations with them in my head (although imagined, they cant talk.) BUT I did hear their voices before. Whenever I get too stressed I start hearing voices and there are 3 distinct ones, one girl and two boys. Im fairly sure its them. Has anyone else made up characters and they kinda just co exist with you now? That you know how they feel/react and that they seem to influence your behavior? I don’t think they are real tho.

214,"Sorry for this being so long, but I would appreciate it if you read it through.

I have a very bad fear of vomit. I get panic attacks every time I see/hear someone throw up, or when someone around me is sick, or just hearing ""I don't feel good"".  I'm also super scared of me vomiting, getting extreme anxiety when my stomach and/or head hurts. 

I've had this phobia since I was in second grade, when a kid threw up in class. That was the first time I experienced anxiety. Fast forward to sixth grade, I vomited in my house. I remember EVERYTHING from that day. The date (april 7th, 2017), what I played, what book I read, what I ate at school, what I saw on tv, what underwear I had, what I felt before throwing up, etc. I can tell you the whole day without missing any details.

Since the lockdown started my stomach started to hurt every day (not so bad, but enough to make me cry of fear somedays). I found out I have irritable bowel syndrome so I started to avoid dairy and spicy foods, but the pain is still there. I tell my parents, but they don't understand that this is a phobia I can't control. They tell me ""no one likes being sick"" ""why are you scared?"" ""just don't throw up"". (this sounds so edgy omg) They have no idea of the things I feel every day, but not because they are bad parents, but because they just don't understand. 

I've gone to a psychologist for two years (I stopped going since December I don't know why) and to a psychiatrist for depression issues (I don't have depression anymore. Yay!). But when I went to the psychiatrist a week ago she diagnosed me with anxiety. I described her my fear but she doesn't treat phobias. I looked up therapists in my city that do (the psychologist I used to go to also didn't treat phobias) and I found one that seemed to be very good.

But I was so afraid of telling my parents about her, so I just told them I wanted to go back to my old psychologist and they agreed. Maybe she could tell me about phobia therapists.

218,"Hello

I know this might not sound like a problem that i should get my hands on at all, or even where i should post this, but i was  having an anxiety attack prior to writing this, , but time is ticking. But i have emotionally connected to this girl and i can't let her to go back to her family. The details (I will refer to my friend as R, and her mom as M): My best friend started to date this girl from a different town (it ain't that far). Everything was fine and dandy he didn't really notice anything wrong with her, only that her delivery is a bit cold or may sound very passive aggressive, i most certainly noticed and just thought that she is just a bit rude. But as it turns out as many things it stems from her home, family and surroundings. Apparently, her mom is a full blown alcoholic and i say this without a shadow of a doubt a full blown sociopath. No i'm not saying this because it would make my story more dramatic, she bullseyes every single tick when i looked up the key factors to recognize a sociopath. I went to her home once, and me and her boyfriend were bombarded with rude remarks and i didn't fully understand was this some sort of joke i'm not in on yet, but when i started to notice the way she talked with R, full of curse words, calling her a bitch, slut basically any horrible thing you can say to your offspring. It was a really horrible expirience, but then i got some more details. Apparently M does not work anywhere, she survives off R and her sisters disability checks, constantly verbally abuses her (And i'm not sure but i think she told her boyfriend that she was physically abused by her aswell). M really hates R boyfriend, because he is not rich and doesn't buy her alcohol (R had an ex that was a drug dealer and was good friends with M, used to buy her alcohol and drink together. On topic of that M does not hide the fact that she incredibly cares only about herself, and even tried to convince R to get back with her ex even tho he was a complete fuckhead who didn't leave R alone and kept calling her for months after they broke up. Obviously because she will have someone to buy her alcohol.) I heard enough to understand that M is a sociopath, there are no social norms for her, she shows no remorse nor empathy, is fueled by only her own needs, does not think of consequences ( very obviously) is really aggressive (not physically but verbally: Shouts on R all the time when we were there, even angrily answering to our non important questions). I think i established that this is pretty f\*\*ked up, and i wouldn't believe it if i wasn't there. Anyways R is riddled with health complications, i think is autistic, but she is such a sweet girl, innocent and naive and not that bright. And my friend just admitted that he doesn't love her, and well it's because he felt like she would be a burden to him. I was quick to correct him that really he has the option to just end it, but he is really thinking only about himself, and well he admitted that the feelings have faded (not to bash on my friend, but i hate that so much) This weekend R was with her boyfriend at his place with his family and she seems to be shunned by his family for being riddled with complications and not ""bright"", but very politely as i understood ( that influenced his view about the whole thing for sure.)  So he is planning to tell her how he is feeling today or tomorrow, and because he has a job and that's not his property but his parents, he is gonna drive her home, while being in denial that she just hyperbolizes her problems for pity, but i'm sure this is serious and that's her best way of crying for help that she does not want to go back there. Ok, so i'm really heartbroken by this very very badly and i want do to whatever it takes to save her from that. because i live with my parents currently, i cannot decide anything and i don't work anywhere (yet.) i was planning to rent an flat and just live for as much as i could, i do have some money under my belt, but i'm not sure if i could secure my financial stability in upcoming months.

I'm really at a loss here, and i just need some ideas to help me either cope with this or to save her from bullshit.

233,"Hello. I (F26) want to set up an appointment with a therapist or counselor. I have gone to one in the past: first in undergrad due to panic attacks and stress, then in grad school due to stress revolving around my relationship, job, and school. However, when I went in grad school, I had some negative experiences with my service that make me question going again. 

Specifically, when I tried to make an appointment, I wad denied and told I did not meet the criteria for their services and to instead get help through a breathing technique app or a career coach. These do not help me. So, I petitioned several times and was able to start meeting with the psychiatrist. I found the sessions helpful, a great release of pressure and stress. But then one session he told me that there are patients who ""actually really need"" this service compared to me, suggesting that my situation wasn't that serious. I started feeling guilty for going- that I was wasting his time and others' time. In our last session, he told me he didn't know how to help me. I felt like our sessions were so helpful, I could finally get things off my chest and talk through my problems, but it seems that he saw no benefit in it. I felt real hopeless from that session and stopped going.

I haven't had a session since February, but I still feel overwhlemed and burdened to the point of exhaustion. I don't have panic attacks, self harm, or think about suicide. I just have no one to talk to, so I bottle up all this chaos until it breaks me. It makes me sick to my stomach or gives me headaches and once made me pass out. Stress is so high and constant that it is my normal.

Is it bad of me to seek mental health services if my situation isn't serious or life-threatening?

Is it bad of me to use mental health services as a space to talk rather than to get treatment (e.g. learn about breathing techniques)?

Does my situation warrant/justify going to mental health services?",05Jul2020,1

246,"Hey,

I’m a teenager, and I have a couple of problems.


So, first things first. Me and my mother don’t have a good relationship. We clash and she very, VERY obviously favours my younger sibling to me. She vents all of her stress into me and in return, this has started to take a toll on me. It’s not extreme abuse or anything, it’s just terrible wording and the constant complaining/nagging at me for minimalistic things, getting mad at me for making a glass of water but not my sister (even though she never asked for one), telling me I cannot be stressed and other things that I personally find quite harmful. I don’t even see her as a mother figure anymore, I feel much safer and much more comfortable around my grandmother. As far as I’m concerned? She’s my mother. 

Over the past year or so I think I’ve been getting worse. I very obviously have a stress issue (which my family denies by telling me I have nothing to be stressed about aka “get over it), the smallest things irritate me. I have breakdowns where I’ll sit and sob, particularly after my mother has gotten stressed/mad at me, but quickly get over them within 10 minutes or so. I struggle to sleep and I have what I can only describe as social anxiety (that might not be it but that’s the best way I can describe it). I’m extremely forgetful, I move backwards and forwards from my mothers place and my grandmothers and I keep leaving behind small things like chargers or wires (for my Xbox). This is another thing my mother gets stressed at me over and tells me that it’s my fault and I have to deal with it, despite my grandmother offering to bring it, she lives less than 5 minutes away. I also struggle to find motivation to get out of bed, do school work, ect. I also struggle to concentrate on multiple things and can only really focus on 2 things at once when I’m playing video games/listening to music (quite honestly the only escapes I have). 

I think I need help. A therapist or even a person at school to speak to. But as I’ve said before, I have what can only be described as social anxiety and I break down when trying to talk about any of this. I’ve also had a bad experience with therapists in the past (TW: slight self harm) related to me scratching my arms when I was frustrated which has lead to me not trusting them. I also can’t really talk about my actual feelings to my grandmother or mother, they’ve told me I can’t feel stress before and I’m afraid they’d either exaggerate it or simply push it aside. 

I’m struggling, and I’m only quite young. I don’t want this to get worse but I don’t want help. What do I do? And is there a name to what I’m currently experiencing (regarding my forgetfulness, stress and breakdowns)?

Here was a change in the status quo.

For the major portion of our session we explored my feelings on the news she had presented me with.

The ongoing discussion of multiple major traumas in my life along with my gut feeling of desiring to return to the unit to visit/walk through, after forty-five years. 

The unit at first was terrifying, yet soon enough I fell under it's spell.

A place where for the first time in my life I was able to breath.

After nine months of sanity, I was thrust back into a world that hadn't changed even thou I had.

Back to a family that came to visit me only twice during my stay and never once came to a family oriented therapy session.

Back to a school where my attackers had spread the “He's a faggot” rumor, only to be ostracized by the other students. 

No follow up program was offered or initiated.

Once again I was on my own, still trying to put the pieces of my life together.

I launched into that digression as a segue into my thoughts and questions. 

 As is true with any client therapist relationship there is a long period of gaining trust in your therapist and the willingness to open ones heart and mind.

The willingness to allow yourself to be vulnerable in the face of another.

How long does it take to know you are in a safe place?

At this time I am in the midst of an important juncture.

I have begun to see the tragedy my life has been.

While uncovering the suppressed/repressed parts of my memory that lay untouched for years.

While there is never a good time for a client to be faced with the reality that their therapy is to be put on hold or even canceled.

It is for me occurring at a time when I am beginning to see hope somewhere in the future. 

Are those hopes to be ignored, by the person I trusted to help see me through to the end?

We have not yet spoken of alternatives, that will come in future sessions.

It may well be that a “fresh pair of ears” will create new opportunities for discovery.

I for one am not looking forward to beginning anew with another person.

I had made great strides forward over the last year and had hoped for a long term relationship with my present therapist. 


Alas this is not fated to be.

Has anyone else feel like they have been abandoned by their therapist?

252,"I'm 22M, living with my mom, and this thing really makes my life harder.

When a person don't respond to me in 5 seconds, I automatically assume that they are intentionally ignoring me. When someone is looking at me for too long, I automatically assume that they are thinking I look bad. When I see an internet post, I often automatically except comments to be aggressive and negative, often even imagining the examples. Whe when I post or comment myself, I'm always being very afraid to read responses, to the point that I don't read them for hours, or sometimes even days.

And the worst part is how this poisons my interactions with my mom. When she talks loudly in another room, I automatically assume that she is yelling at me. I very often treat things she says to me (even the innocent ones) as personal accusations of me doing something wrong. And when she is nocking my room's door (or even when she is not, and it's done by the wind), my first thoughts is that she is angry and going to yell at me.

253," This is Kai, a Co-Host in an OSDD-1B system. The Ember System. 

 We decided to kick off the channel with whatever was of interest to us at the time: a peek behind the curtains. (Plus I have been SUPER anxious about  videoing so I just needed a launching point)  I'll be posting bi-weekly. Let me know if you have any video suggestions in the comments!:)  

Topics in Kai's video: The complexity of consciousness, be-ing, time, and even a little quantum mechanics theory! 

Topics in Kyle's Video: Dissociative Identity Disorder and Otherwise Specified Dissociative Disorder

These will lead to future videos on everything from studies of various Zen and Yogic traditions, philosophy and phenomenology, applications and inspiration for self-improvement/self-actualization/enlightenment. (These are usually more in the realm of Stone's interest - Stone is an alternate 'state' or 'part' in our Otherwise Specified Dissociative Dissorders - 1 B system) 

 We will also be sharing videos on polyvagal theory, structural dynamics, the fragmentary nature of the self, and how to start a path to working with head mates to create a flowing system of life that can realize the vast potential we each hold inherently.   

So, have any questions? Anything Confusing? Any topics you'd like to have elaborated on? Not sure what OSDD means and how it relates to DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)? Can a person with multiple parts work on enlightenment work even when not integrated and not pursuing integration? 

Or if ya just wanna say hi, leave a comment and I'll get back asap. Let me know. I love each of you, truly. I hope you are holding up through this crisis. Can't wait to chat:)

254,"Hello. So I've spent the past 4 years battling mental health issues including depression and anxiety. Now, I'm doing a lot better. I've learned to cope with a lot of my symptoms, but the core of my problems is still left untapped. I just hate myself. No matter how much self compassion I have, no matter how much care I give myself, at the end of the day, I hate myself. My self hatred feels like a solid wall at the core of my existence and like it's part of me. All of my life's decisions now are based on self hatred. I make decisions because I believe that I'm stupid or ugly or undeserving. I know that's wrong, and I try to fix that, but it still feels like I'm only learning how to cope with my self hatred. I cannot seem to tackle it and break it down.

I want this to stop but I don't even know where to start. I have been to therapy but we never got to the core of my problems and then I stopped being able to afford it due to the pandemic. I just don't know how to proceed on my own at this point. How can I break down such a big part of me and rebuild something better? I don't want it to take another 4 years. Does anyone have any advice?",05Jul2020,1

257,"So about five years ago, I dated this girl who I met online (which honestly hurt the situation from the start). She had some mental health issues that I will keep vague simply to respect her own privacy. To keep it simple, she had temperament issues that were so severe that my parents basically split us up and cut me off from her without me saying goodbye. They thought she was a psychopath and after a while I thought so too. To this day I've been taught to reject and hate people with those issues. They're bad news. Since then, my life got worse but eventually got better. In the past year and a half, I've fallen in love with my best friend. I honestly think she is the one. I've also warmed up to old and new friends and my social problems have (mostly) faded to the background. I learned how to love others and love myself and my family saw a new happier side of me that they never saw before. My life felt like it was finally going for a future I could see.  


Then COVID-19 happened, then the quarantine happened. The worst of myself came out. I was so fed up with the stupidity of the situation that I started threatening people on the internet, telling some to kill themselves, promoting violent action against and wishing death upon people who don't act responsible in this crisis, which even included some members of my own family (though I never confronted them directly).  


As you can see, I've already crossed a line. Not even the girl I dated in the past has done/would do that.  


I can see myself getting  more and more uncontrollable during the quarantine at the fear and the anger at the world for not being able to get the situation right. Other things just add onto it like police brutality, racism, conspiracy theories, climate change denial, anti-vaxxers, and so on.  


I don't know what's happening to me and I'm so afraid to get help because I don't want to be locked up or rejected by my friends and family because of what is happening in my head, but I also want to protect them and myself from what could happen if I keep going down this path. Today, I stared at a ceiling fan for a good hour debating whether or not to hang myself, which I haven't thought seriously about in a long time. Obviously I got control of myself because I'm here now asking for help. I'm so scared to get help because I feel like the world is going to reject me for my problems. I've gained so much in the past year and a half that I don't want to lose, but I also want to protect the ones I love from the person I might become. I already reject myself. I don't want to become a bad or dangerous person, but I just don't know how to fight this. What do I do?

265,"Hi,

With the increasing openness and destigmatization surrounding mental health, I have a question.

As a kid, I knew very few people with mental health issues, but now that I'm a little older, I think I know more people with than without. Within the last two years, suddenly 7/10 of my friends were diagnosed with depression, anxiety, or both, and it made me wonder: 

*If everyone (or such a huge number of people) has depression, then when does it become normal? Does it ever become just a normal thing that people go through, that isn't a ""condition""? (in the case of depression and anxiety, i don't know many other disorders, illnesses, etc, that are as common)*

The thought of pills have always been something that I feared and tried to avoid because I've known too many people who have OD'd (purposefully and accidentally).

So, if mental health struggles like depression and anxiety are becoming normal, do we still need to medicate people (who aren't a harm to themselves or others)?

I know that mental health isn't black and white, and one remedy may work for one person and not another. But I was wondering if we could ever normalize depression and anxiety (in non-extreme cases) and not have it classified as a disorder since it seems like more and more people are being diagnosed.",05Jul2020,1

271,"My friend shared a post that I happened to be kind of offended by. I felt it was misinformation about what exactly self harm is. I'm someone who used to cut myself, and punch myself till I was yellow; I was offended that these things could be considered equal to what I experienced. 

The post said: 

""Self-harm is more than inflicting pain on the physical body. It is also harming yourself emotionally, mentally, or spiritually""

This part I could agree with. However the image listed these behaviors as self harm: 


""This is self harm:
-pretending 

-sharing with people who can't support you

-not asking for what you need

-judging yourself harshly

-being inauthentic 

-thinking negatively about yourself

-preoccupying yourself with other people's lives 

-expecting things to be perfect

-Allowing fear to stop you

-choosing to remain silent

-complaining about changing what you can control""


I disagree with this. From my experience, a lot of these are behaviors I've developed too. Ive been told its a side effect or a defense mechanism the brain developed to cope with my life long emotional neglect. These things can be associated with trauma. 

However, in my honest opinion, self-harm is intentional. I chose to cut myself (for whatever dark reasons). These behaviors dont come about just because you want to. Theyre subconscious. Theyre things that take work to fix.

Theyre just not self harm in my book, but something different. 

My big fear is that people will start saying they ""self harm "" just because they experience a few of these behaviors.  Sure it warrents you to seek therapy, but its not the same as intentionally inflicting pain on your body.

272,"Recently I (17M) have been feeling down, and this is because I don't really know who I am anymore. I used to know what made me happy in life and I had goals that I would aim towards.

But now I don't know, the motivation I had isn't there anymore with the exception of occasional bursts that disappear as fast as they arrive

I want to be able to sit down and talk through my feelings, even if just to myself. But doing that feels impossible because I immediately get overwhelmed with emotions. As if just thinking about who I am results in my mind defending itself by scaring me into distracting myself and when I confronted those feelings recently they made me scared to go to sleep.

I don't know what to do, as I haven't had anything like this before but I have had these emotions for a few months now and probably started 2 years ago and have slowly grown

What I want to do is become motivated again into aiming toward goals but I don't even have goals anymore, not ones that feel in reach anyway

Recently I have also been feeling as if I am constantly battling two sides of myself. One side is happy and feels like it's without a care, and the other one is one that just wants to ruin myself, whether it be telling other people about my emotions or contemplating self harm.

273,"So pretty much what happened was a lot. It started in November 2019, I couldn't eat, and would throw up a lot, still don't know what was up with that, it went on until April 2020, it's just kinda been shrugged off as anxiety. It got really bad in January, I was down 12 pounds from already severely underweight and in and out of the hospital almost constantly. This caused me to have 59 attendence strikes 2nd semester, for a triple honors class kid going into concert season, it was really bad with low grades and missing work. But all of that was minute compared to February. 

On one of the last days in January my now ex asked me to meet him somewhere and I did, no big deal, we're dating, probably a pop date or something. Long story short I got raped. Or at least I think I did? He wanted to do sex and I did not. I told him no but he kept saying ""come on, don't you love me?"" ""Don't you trust me?"" And pushing me back against this one wall in the dugout we were in until I just kind of nodded. It wasn't vaginal penetration cause he simply couldn't find it, but it was anal and it hurt like a bitch. There was no pleasure and I wanted to stop after it first started but he said no, that we would be fine, that we were too far in to stop and that I should relax and enjoy it. I didn't even moan, there was simply no feeling. I just kinda let my mind go blank, like retreating into my head or go afk but in real life. I wish I had struggled more, but I didn't which is why I don't think it was rape, but on the other hand I was pressured into consent and when I tried to take it back I was denied. Either way it was statutory, he was a week past his 16th (age of consent in my state) and I was a week from my 15th, so still 14. 

A few hours after that a friend died of cancer, she was 16, her birthday was in April. A few hours after her one of my friends grandpa also passed away, all of my extended family lives pretty far away so he was like my grandpa as said friend was my ""cousin"" and most people assumed we were actually siblings. Three blows within 24 hours. As mentioned, my birthday was the next week, it was spent at both funerals. The following week was Valentine's day, supposed to be our 6 month. He broke up with me on February 12, and was dating one of my friends within the week. 

Right after I had gone through the shock of two deaths, the illness was getting way worse, I was at my lowest weight - 84. NOT healthy for a 5'4 15f. I genuinely felt I was going to die, if not throwing up, then chronic migraines and worrying fevers. Anyway, fast forward to February-July. Almost everytime I sleep I see one of the three events and wake up sweating and crying when it's really cold in my room and I sleep with no blankets. 

Whenever me and my boyfriend are talking and he makes a sexual innuendo as even a joke I get really bad flashbacks to that one night and other events like when he'd grope me on the bus when I'd tell him stop he'd just tell me to shush or cover my mouth. I know I was more of just a number to him, but it was nice to have some attention as my relationship prior to that was extremely physically abusive and I have lots of pictures of bruises from that one, and he also would sexually assault me, though I'd fight back and he'd threaten my little sister or smack me so I'd stop which is why I think I didn't fight the guy after him either. So yeah, the flashbacks can send me through whirls of sadness, anger, etc. And get triggered by sounds, scents, etc. Like they make it hard to breathe or move or anything and it's like I have to relive it every time and I just want it to stop. I just want everything to stop.

It feels a little better to kind of vent it all out though some of my friends say I should be over it by now. But I'm still not sure if it is PTSD or if it's normal or anything. Idk, answers or general support are much appreciated but definitely not required, I just need to be heard for once, I've felt for so long like my voice falls on deaf ears. Also, sorry this post is such a mess.",05Jul2020,1
274,"Hi,

So basically, I have always suffered with severe sickness due to my anxiety. Since primary school, I've had this problem where I am physically sick if I get anxious enough. If this was something that only happened in certain situations, I could maybe cope with it, but it literally effects everything in my day to day life. I am now 22, and since being old enough to drink, I have found that alcohol completely erases my sickness feeling, and makes it a lot easier to deal with. 
Obviously I am aware that using alcohol is not the answer, and I understand how harmful it can be if I were to use it a lot. But my question is, what is it that makes alcohol give me confidence and removes my sickness? I have read up about Dopamine but am still not certain about it. I was just wondering if there is a medication that works in a similar way to how alcohol works but without the negative effects or even just the drunkeness as I don't even need to be drunk for my anxiety to practically disappear. Surely, there must be something that can help me as my life is very difficult to deal with, especially as I've been trying everything I can to help for the last 12 years of my life and I really don't want to become dependant on alcohol. 

I hope this post is clear enough for anyone to understand my issue, but if it isn't, I am happy to answer any other questions that anybody has as I am desperate for help.

I really appreciate anyone that has any ideas or suggestions to help me out.

282,"Hi there I’m 22 years old and live with my friend in a small apartment ever since my girlfriend died a year ago I experienced major mental illness and depression it’s gotten so bad that the only time I feel happy is when I shoot heroin or pop a pill I know it’s bad but I do it anyway to give me some happiness.I had a mental break down yesterday I was laughing out of nowhere just simply laughing my friend tried to snap me out of it but I just kept on then I started hallucinating about my girlfriend and I started screaming really loud,I was yelling so loud we got noise complaints.this went on for about 30 minutes until I snapped out of it and then I cried.I cried for the longest I’ve ever cried I finally let it all out after a whole year.Today I decided to quit drugs I threw all my pills out all the heroin and I decided to seek out help for once I feel sorta happy I would love some support because the idea of moving on is scary to me for some reason and I know I’ll still have moments where I’m sad and I’ll want to do drugs again so any support helps guys.",05Jul2020,1
283,"I am feeling terribly anxious and depressed today. Last night, I took our 10 year old son outside on our front steps to watch the fireworks (you can see parts of the valley from where we live) and got eaten alive by skeeters. We ordered Chinese food at 10:00 at night and had a peaceful evening. I am struggling with self-harm impulses at the moment. I might just be PMSing...I wish my period would fuck off already. I am 49 and ready to end that part of my life--the childbearing part, that is.

285,"Does talking to oneself normal loudly or does it look like I have hallucinations? I do that a lot especially in the most toughest scenarios in life and also because I don’t talk to my family that much. So I don’t even know if this is normal or not and if not, should I seek professional help given that I’m in quarantine and still living with my parents? And also how because therapy in my country is expensive as fuck",05Jul2020,1
286,"How do I introduce more play into my life? More fun? 

I feel like I am afraid of fun, getting close to people, and disappointing others. I judge people based on the fact that they are selfish because they choose fun over what's right. And, that is my justification for not having as much fun in my life; doing what's right versus what seems desirable. It makes me quite awkward when I do try and be ""fun.""
