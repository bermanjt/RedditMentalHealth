0,"So a little bit of back story: I’ve been dealing with recurrent depression, anxiety, obsessive thoughts and ""drug abuse"". I started to smoke weed to stop my thoughts about over 1,5years ago, it got to the point where I felt it was an essential part of living and thought that without it I’d commit suicide and I grew more resistant to the high and it got too expensive. I had a fear of leaving my house, because of not knowing what could be out there, thinking if I took the bus without bringing my headphones I’d get an anxiety attack that I could break the windows just to get off. The fear of leaving my house was strengthened from the smoking, something I haven’t realized till recently. I realized I had to change a few things and start focusing on working on my problems instead of avoiding them. And during the past 6 months I’ve been without weed, started eating healthier, exercizing and writing down a positive perspective on things that I used to think negatively about (like instead of ""I couldn’t go to the grocery store until 21.00 in the evning"", I’d write ""you did good, you went to the grocery store today""), I went from having nothing except therapy once a week to now having a full week of meaningful things, like a practice jobb on tuesdays and thursdays, therapy on Fridays, reflection group on wednesdays and an being an assistant on a self mastery course that I was previously a part of in the pilot group of the course. I still have though times, I still overthink, but I’m still here and I’ve never felt more complete before. And now in the process I’m in I’ve made a poem to make me think back on the road I’ve taken and I wanted to share it.

(Sorry for the long read)

Poem (chains):

I used to think life was a bad thing,
Wanting to explore space,
yet I was to scared to leave my room.
Bound by chains forged by my own mind.

But I broke those chains, took control.
No more ""what if""s, more trying.
I were met with new beatiful faces and smiles, friends in places I never dared to look, a hand to hold me through hard times.

Now even if I’m still scarred by my chains, I think life is a beatiful thing, for now my troubles had become my servant and not my master, something that gives me wisdom, not doubt.

Now I can do what I want, now I can be free, my chains are no more.

1,"See I never feel depressed or manic,  or atleast I dont think so :/ like I never feel sad or want to cry or anything like that, maybe the only thing I do is lay in bed until the afternoon but that's mostly because i like dreaming and nothing really to do. also I haven't gone manic or felt manic since they said I was when I was hospitalized.  Like I'm pretty sure I just had psychosis from abusing my amphetamines and triazolam as well as smoking weed every day. As well as the fact I had a salvia trip that made me think gods showed me the answer to the universe and the meaning behind every thing and then that was taken way over the top when I tried to teach myself music theory and somehow figured that the arc of the covenant was a music box that had mind and matter controlling powers through waves and feqencys . Basically thought I was the second coming of jesus somehow all over the fact that everything seamed to be connected. And I'm an atheist.  Like gods and magic is the last thing i would think was real. Same as learning about nickola Tesla and thinking the pryamids were possibly power generators or entrance to hollow earth or possibly something else that could control the weather who knows but shit made me go insane pretty well because everything seamed to actully fit and everything I was learning was basically what I was shown In my salvia trip. And the salvia trip was basically me creating the universe with sacred geometry and music . Then i was a 5 dimensional book that could turn the pages of time forward or back but doing so felt like I was  being ripped and flipped very hard to describe.  

But ya I dont see how I'm bipoler if I never get depressed.  I just have existential depression that I might never know or there might not be an after life and when I die nothing happens or I won't get any  answers to anything.  That's the only thing I'm scared of . Just not knowing . 

I wish there was an actual test to see if I am bipoler not just them thinking I am because I acted out in the hospital. Like they said because I ran around and had a lot of confidence that I was in a manic episode basically.  And now psychedelics wont work because of the antipsychotic and antidepressant I'm on who knows if lithium interferes too. So now I cant even trip which is probably the worst thing about it .

So ya I just dont see how I'm bipoler. Crazy sure bipoler idk .",26Feb2020,1
2,"This has some kind of NSFW details. I don’t even know if this is the right sub but my mental health is definitely being affected lol.

Here is the backstory: a couple months ago I reconnected with this guy I went to school with. When I saw him again, I found him attractive. We messaged each other on social media and hung out together. It was a lot of fun and we got along with each other really well, and I was happy to reconnect with an old friend. 

One day we decided to get drunk and play video games together, we ended up cuddling each other, I performed oral on him briefly, I was okay with this and I do regret doing it but it was not a violation of consent. I don’t feel like I was taken advantage of in any way.

I am not a sexual person, and though I enjoy cuddling I do not feel sexual attraction or desire partnered sex. I’ve had sex many times just because I think it’s what I “should” do to please the other person, and I decided I should stop this unhealthy behavior. I brought all this up to him. He understood completely, said he had actually dated someone who was non-sexual before, and we agreed to not have sexual contact. Not once did he try to initiate sex after this.

We kept up the friends with cuddles relationship for a while. Then one night, I was spending time with some of my lifelong friends and I mentioned the guy, because my friends had also gone to the same school and knew him. They immediately said he was a creep, he had not changed since high school, and that he was manipulative and would act completely normal to gain people’s trust but would “switch” on them later on.

The guy was also moving out of his house since his two female roommates wanted him out. His version of the story was completely, totally different from my friends’ take on this. They knew the roommates and said that one girl claimed she’d hear her door open while she was sleeping, and saw him peeking into her bedroom. He would also lurk around the bathroom while she was showering? 

There was also a girl who he had fooled around with, he said that they were both drunk and that he had told her it was okay to say no and that they didn’t have to do anything, I’m not sure if anything sexual occurred. My friends said that he was NOT drunk but she was, and that he had tried to coerce her into having sex. So, yeah, I stopped messaging the guy and luckily he stopped messaging me though I’m not sure why. 

For some reason I’m still anxious about running into this dude. I’ve had anxiety dreams about running into him and him trying to take advantage of me. I don’t know why I’m so paranoid about this guy, because he never actually creeped me out or did anything that made me uncomfortable. I’m glad I got out of that situation as soon as I could because this guy clearly had a history of disturbing behavior towards women (and men as well). 

I’ve never experienced anxiety and paranoia over someone like this before. Sure these feelings would be normal at first, but I don’t know why they’re suddenly resurfacing long after I cut the guy off. I think it’s affecting me subconsciously and I’m starting to ruminate a bit. I served a customer that looked slightly like him earlier today, and it made me feel a bit uneasy. That is definitely not normal. 

Sorry this was a rant but my next therapy appointment until mid March, and I just needed a place where maybe someone could share some advice. Thank you for reading this.",26Feb2020,1
3,"I'm not sure if you can fake a stutter but I don't think I am? I mean it comes up when I'm nervous or talking to adults, ie: cashiers and the like. Today I was getting an injection and I'm not even sure why I'm nervous, it's not as if the pain bugged me? 

I could barely say anything, I mean the lady asked me my mothers name and I spent about one whole minute trying to say it but just said ""I-it's"". I've even started to stutter when speaking to the lunch ladies, which I didn't do before.

For other symptoms of anxiety I also;
^ramble a lot
^fiddle constantly
^have paranoid thoughts of worse outcomes (ie: I'll think of doing something that I'd never do in a social situation and worry that I'll do it for some reason; I also, like if I trip a bit or I'm going down the stairs see myself falling in the floor, cracking my head open)
^think everyone hates me
^have developed a nervous tick in my eye
^shake and hide behind someone else and hyperventilate if someone's shouting, even if it's not at me. Like shouting in anger though


Do you think it's anxiety or am I exaggerating or is it just normal? I mean I know a few people with anxiety and it just seems so different? Like my sister has anxiety (I'd never guess though, she's opinionative and confident af?? Like idk, shes still a bitch though :p) and so does my best friend, but she has very extreme anxiety (she's not diagnosed because her parents are douches). Another friend of mine has anxiety and she's way more quiter than me.

I'm not sure if I have it and if I think I do should I talk to my therapist about it? I'm not even sure if I want to he diagnosed or have medicine because my sister would just put me down because she thinks that I'm faking all my mental struggles and hates me,, or does she??

5,"Hi All,

I’m 27F living in NYC and have been struggling with Bipolar ll and anxiety since I was 7. Recently, my depressive episodes have been very bad. They are also accompanied by *super fun* daily panic attacks. 

I really need help adjusting my meds. I currently have a psychiatrist in NYC but he is out of network and I’m paying a whopping $355/session. This seems to be the norm in NYC, as most psychiatrists are out-of-network. I’m needing more appointments than usual to get my mental health back on track, but I just can’t afford $355/session anymore.

Does anyone have any recommendations on affordable psychiatrists in NYC or resources I can refer to to find one? There’s just so many out there and it’s very overwhelming on how to find one. For reference, my insurance is United Healthcare. Choice Plus. The max I’m willing to pay right now is $200-$250.

Apologies for the lengthy post, but really appreciate any support or recommendations. Thanks all.",26Feb2020,1
6,"So, long story short, I love rap. It's my life, and Eminem is my idol. I don't really rap myself or anything but I've learned Em's fastest raps such as the newest one in Godzilla (the song). I wanted to show my mom, but she said she didn't want to hear it because she already heard me practicing (when I barely knew and sucked) and thought that she didn't need to hear the finished version. Then, I wanted to show my dad but realized he heard me from my room when I was practicing and sounding bad (it was the unpolished version). He said, ""It's great"", with a pretending-to-be-proud smile. I knew it was the bad version. But he thought he had to pretend it was good and take pity on me. Then he said, ""And your mom's been sick all week. Give her a break."" Yk, because she didn't want to listen. I tried to explain, but all that could get through the horrid thoughts swarming in my head was ""I-"". I just sat there and stared at the floor. I tried to cover up the tears welling up in my eyes. After a bit he said ""The world doesn't care about or want to hear what I do, either"". I feel so broken. I'm almost a year depression free.

7,"Hey, guys, I have been feeling kinda down recently thinking about my own mortality and along with my parents. I am in high school but I love my parents so much I don't want them to die and I don't want my family to die. This makes me so sad because I love my family so much and it makes me want to cry. Anybody have any coping strategies to make me feel better? Its like we spend so much of our time on this Earth on stupid shit like school and work that we don't get to bond more with the ones we truly love. Sometimes what makes me feel better is that thin reality I can cure aging in the future or cryo-genecially freeze me and my families bodies when we die so that we have some chance of living in the future again. I come from a background of Islam, so I really want to believe Heaven is real, bc I really want it to be. As I am typing, I am feeling a little better as Im throwing my emotions out here that have been pent up for a long time. I want to be on this planet with my parents and siblings for a long time. Sometimes these thoughts make me cry myself to sleep because I don't want to forget the memories they are giving me. It's like I'm looking for some sort of way to justify that I will be able to prolong my life with my family. Being a boy, and always having the need to repress my emotions about these topics around my famiily is tough bc I love them all so much. Also my mind goes to bad places, as I looked up sad statistics of life, like by the time you graduate from high school, 90 percent of your time with your parents is done. I know I'm going on a tangent but I really want some coping techniques guyss please. Thanks you",26Feb2020,1

They live inside my head,
They terroize my mind, 
And fill my heart with dread.

And makes me sad and meek,
One makes me worry, 
And panic makes me weak, 
The last creates nightmares, 
And robs me of my sleep. 

I have these little monsters, 
They live inside my head, 
I don't know how much to take, 
Of all the things they've said. 

The pills are meant to quiet them, 
Or keep them all at bay, 
But the monsters keep on nagging me, 
Wheverever I stand or lay.

They live inside my head, 
I have these little monsters,

11,"Hello, I am 15 (f) and I need some help. Ever Since I started going through puberty or at least that’s when I remember it starting my mind is always changing. I’m probably the most indecisive person ever. And it’s honestly not healthy because I’ve been wasting money on by impulse buying. One Example I can tell you is earlier in this year I really really wanted a pet bird, I did all my research and bought everything for her. I just came up with this fantasy in my head that have a pet bird would be so great and now I feel like the idea did not live up to the expectation. Another thing I have done this year was movies my whole bed room down stairs for around a 2 weeks before realizing it was a mistake. It’s also really hard for me to stick to a hobby I tried to get really in to make up and bought a whole bunch and don’t even wear it. I also tried to get into witch craft but it didn’t work out.

12,"So, I've been experiencing this really unsettling feeling not feeling apart of reality or reality around me not feeling real. It's really hard to explain and it stresses me out a ton. I'm 16 and male.

I've noted down certain symptoms that are ongoing or seem to reoccur.

Ongoing:
- Reality around me doesn't feel real. This could be explained almost as there is glass or screen in front of my vision at all time that makes things seem unfocused or tunnel vision (I don't wear glasses or need them)
- I feel as I'm being control by another version myself. I have a quite bubbly and almost vain personality. But when this showed up, it felt almost as I'm always critically thinking or serious but it's still me. This feeling of being controlled usually affects my performation in social conversation.

- I feel nervous when moving from location to location. This is new quite new to me. Usually, when I go from my upstairs bedroom to my downstairs kitchen, there is no problem. With this new feeling however, I either try to convience my not to move or move as quick as possible as it stresses me out and makes me nervous. This also occurs in the school classroom.

Reoccuring:
- A sudden feeling of absolute dread and fear from existential thought that can't seem remember. When I go through this, my heart race, my vision feels extremely blurry and I feel the need to squeeze something close by to make sure im in touch with reality

13,"It was like 1am. I still have PTSD from a prior assault that also started with some stranger following me (out of a bar) and aggressively flirting with me in the middle of the night. So I was freaking the fuck out about it last night, and had even unfolded my knife inside my pocket. I was just worried that I needed to be ready to take it out, if necessary, because I hadn't been ready enough last time. 

And this is all after an especially bad week, during which my doctor refused to fill the meds that I need to treat my PTSD, anxiety, and traumatic brain injury. I've been having panic attacks almost every night, and haven't slept in 4 days. 

So his ridiculous proclamation that ""life can't be *that* bad"" sounded kinda like an ironic taunt.

I got to my car without further incident, *thankfully*, but idk why or how the hell he could possibly presume to know how bad my life is, or why he wouldn't realize that he'd actually just made things *much* worse. 

I guess this really just hasn't been my best week ever...though it's certainly not my worst. But I'm  *really* pissed that my doctor is refusing to fill my psych meds for no good reason, without even offering any alternative treatments. Not to mention that it just seems super fucking reckless to suddenly yank somebody off their psych meds when they're really, really not in a good place, even on a *good* day.

I mostly wish that I could sleep through the night without having a panic attack. I'm tired and anxious and paranoid and grumpy, and the people around me seem almost comically stupid right now.",26Feb2020,1
14,"So a little over a year ago I was in a mentally abusive relationship and didn't even realize. It was really only two months ago when I realized it was abusive. For so many months after the relationship was over, I kept asking myself why I kept thinking about her as much as I did, and why it brought me so much pain to think about her. So often when I am in crowds and see someone who slightly resembles her, it really brings down my mood and spikes my anxiety. 

I work at a fast-food restaurant, that has a lot of customers 24/7, and has a lot of employees. I was a cashier, and there was one other cashier working. We probably had about ten customers in line. When I looked at one of the customers on the line, she looked exactly like my abusive ex, with her hair dyed a different color. It was so scary how much it looked like my abusive ex, that I was convinced that she had dyed her hair and just by coincidence walked into the restaurant while I was working there. I immediately started having a panic attack at the thought of having to ring up my ex abuser. My heart was pounding, and my whole body was shaking. One of the managers saw that I wasn't helping customers for like 2 seconds and told me to start serving the customers. So I pushed through a panic attack and kept serving customers, just praying that she would go to the other cashier. I kept thinking about what I would do if it was actually her. Would I take her order and just pretend not to recognize her? Would I be able to make eye contact with her without crying? Would I look at her and immediately run to the back? I have this crippling fear that she will one day learn about how much she hurt me and feel good about it. It's like it's a game and if she finds out that I am hurt she wins and I lose. 

So she thankfully goes to the other cashier. THANK GOD. And then she speaks to him, and I realize that it wasn't her. This girl was a complete stranger. I was in the middle of a panic attack for nothing. And now I am embarrassing myself in front of customers because I am mixing up their sodas and trembling all over. 

I don't know how to deal with this. I have been out of an abusive relationship for over a year and I still think about her almost every day. I know I am safe and will never see her again, but I never feel safe. I'm always a little afraid of seeing her in public one day and having a mental breakdown over it. I just want to get her out of my head and never think of her for the rest of my life. I am afraid people don't take this issue as seriously as it is because I am a guy. I'm afraid I'm weak because of how much this affects me to this day.

15,"So my girlfriend is a diagnosed schizophrenic and her mom who is a psychiatrist is saying she is a sociopath but she isn’t 18 so she can’t get a diagnosis, I love her and she loves me too but I don’t know what steps I should take from here on out. I don’t want to leave her and especially in this tough time but the fact she’s probably a sociopath is scary. I already knew about the schizophrenia for a months before we dated but the sociopathic tendencies is something that I’m just starting to think is a concerning thing, I will still support her but I need to know whether she is a fit for a relationship or no.

17,"I have crap insurance so I've been on a waitlist for therapy for four months. I finally get a call from the office yesterday. I'm at work so I can't immediately pick it up. They don't leave a voicemail because my mailbox was full (I was unaware of this). When I call back the receptionist tells me she doesn't make the appointments, the therapists do and she has no way to look up who called me. Then she tells me that if I want therapy I should have had my mailbox clear because I'm on a waitlist. Cause obviously I should be up to date on everything while I'm already struggling or I don't deserve to not be struggling? She says she will try and figure out who called me and call me back. Ok. 

I have anxiety and abandonment issues. So, me being me, 24 hours pass and I call to check in since I haven't heard anything. The receptionist obviously recognized my number on caller ID because she picks up with ""I haven't called you yet have I?"" No. No she hasn't. But I'm just checking in. This all devolves into us going back and forth. Mainly I just want to know how I can make sure I'm still on the waitlist or get in contact with anyone who can help me. She just keeps telling me she will call me and until then Ill just have to deal with no further information. She again reiterates that if I wanted therapy I'd have been available for a voicemail. I ask for her supervisor and she hangs up on me. 

Why work here and treat people looking for help like trash? I just have anxiety and I've been going without therapy for a while now and will deal for a while longer. I can't imagine if I was suicidal or just even in a worse place mentally. This woman is actually a danger to have in this kind of position. 

I reported her to the main location of this practice. They were able to schedule me for an appointment. For August. But I can work back from there. The main location actually encouraged me to call here and there to check for cancellations if I wanted to.

20,"Hi. I am not diagnosed but I just found out it is common for schizophrenics and in general to think that if they see meaningful coincidences/synchronicities, it is a sign of their illness. I am on the spiritual path for 5 years now and I just feel like these mental health conditions are partly true and partly fictional. It's like the saying: The psychotic drowns in the same waters in which the mystic swims with delight. 

I think this because I saw this example where they said they found meaningful messages in things around them and they just think they are crazy and they get medicated like for example about their life through the radio, like the song was spot on about their life. Well... I have this so many times! I believe the inner and outer world are interconnected so, whenever you are in alignment, you automatically experience these things more. So, I really think it is dangerous spirituality is not considered in these psych wards. It is really not that special too even, I've had them for years, the craziest ones. I could have also been thinking I'm crazy... but how do you know you are crazy if you live in a world that is totally disconnected with spirit! I'm not saying don't take your symptoms seriously...

I can't say what I did, but I did it knowingly and on more than one occasion. I was young, angry, confused and everything else, but that's no excuse. I didn't kill or rape anyone, so there's no one I can really apologize to or make up to.

Its not the feeling of like “spacing out” in class and then someone snaps their fingers and you’re back, the only thing I can relate it to is when you get really really high (on weed). Like uncomfortably high, except this feeling is happening throughout 90% of my day. I hate this feeling, I have a little over a quarter of high school left and I wanna be able to experience it, but I get panic attacks every day because of the spacey feeling and just end up in the nurse’s office. I’m doing everything I can to stop the feeling, so any advice is helpful, honestly. 

To clarify, I am also on two anti-anxiety meds. One is Cymbalta at 60mg that has worked very well for me, and I got another, Buspirone, from my psychiatrist back in December, but I feel this has made it worse. After starting it I’ve felt even spacier and have had panic attacks every single day. I’m just so tired and don’t know what to do. Of course I’m diagnosed with clinical anxiety and depression, and all this anxiety has thrown me into a depression and I daily consider ending it all because of how tired I am.

What has made this worse is I keep trying to go in and see my psychiatrist again but he keeps pushing my fucking appointments back and won’t answer my calls or call me back. I’m looking at another 2 weeks before seeing him again and I don’t know what to do in the meantime. These panic attacks are so bad when I don’t feel real I can’t do anything, not school, work, hanging out with friends, anything. 

I’ve also been seeing my counselor at school to account for the fact that I can’t afford a therapist. She has told me to try “grounding techniques” like finding ultra sensory objects and focusing on them, but it doesn’t help, it just makes stuff work because my brain kinda thinks “well you wouldn’t be doing these grounding techniques if you weren’t having a panic attack.” 

I’m not trying to self-diagnose but when I look it up online everything points to “disassociative identity disorder,” and it freaks me out but would honestly make sense. I’ve heard that this can come on due to past trauma or PTSD, which I have none of. 

ANY advice will help, thank you so much.",26Feb2020,1
28,"It's a long story but I'm schizoaffective, when my brain isnt having paranoid delusions/hallucinations its fabricating emotional turmoil and conflicts with other people. 

I've had mixed results with drugs. Seroquel worked well but made me feel like I couldn't breethe.

My psychiatrist told me that I am beyond her help and that I need to see a specialist and/or in patient care. Only problem is that I cant find any psychosis/schizophrenia/schizoaffective specialists. A regular shrink alone has a 2 month wait.

Anyone know of where I can find help?",26Feb2020,1
29,"I have no stable access to therapy and no medications. No one but me and the people I tell know. My mom won't schedule a doctors appointment. I think of cutting myself anytime I see something that can become sharp or can cut including paper which I constantly see 24/7. When i go into an episode I have to fight urges to cut which are almost impossible. My only other way of talking to a ""therapist"" is using the suicide chat line wherw you don't call but it takes longer. Does anyone have any methods to help with this?",26Feb2020,1
30," I am Chinese who came to Britain at the age of 2. Previously we lived in Shanghai. My parents are both well off - they have worked as senior managers in finance. I had everything I needed as a kid - I went to private school etc, piano lessons, sport lessons etc, gameboy advance, ps3 etc..

I get on well with my parents, except between the ages of 14-16, where they attempted tiger parenting, and then relaxed completely after I became 17. They are quite reasonable to me and I can discuss most things with them.

However, my dad would often shout at my mum for long periods of time when she made a small mistake. This included a wide range of things like baking potatoes in the rice cooker, not buying the right groceries, eating some of his salted vegetables without permission, coming back a little bit late, not cooking peas with the fish and chips, not buying the right groceries, only cooking 1 plate of dinner ( it was big and tasted good), not cutting carrots the right way, oversleeping a little bit before making dumplings, making the soup too chunky etc, not cooking prawns the right way etc. Each time my mum would cry and make excuses for him ""he is tired from work"" etc.

When my mum got ill, my dad never spoke sympathetic words but instead blamed her on something she did.

For many years I mistakenly thought it was a cultural thing, as there was no other Chinese family I could compare to. I am now 29, and I am still unable to form attraction/intimate relationships with people in my own ethnic group.

Is this normal? Should I just live with it or seek counselling?",26Feb2020,1
31,"I have acute anxiety disorder and moderate depression and am going through a real rough patch right now. My husband has been a literal saint and has helped me every day try to overcome my depression, even when I feel suicidal. It takes me about an hour now just to get out of bed, and the littlest things throw me into ""shut down mode"".

 What makes me feel even worse about myself is not being able to support him emotionally. He is very anxious about an emergency surgery he is having (nothing major, but still very sudden). I have asked him what I can do to help but he says nothing. Because of my mental health he will not talk to me and immediately goes to his mother for support, which makes me feel like a horrible wife. 

 He has started exhibiting physical manifestations (like rapid foot tapping and other anxious body language). This sets me into ""shut down mode"" and I have to physically leave the room to collect myself or I'll begin to have a small panic attack. What can I do in his time of need to help support him when I am at my all time low?",26Feb2020,1
32,"I’m a teenager. Of course, as most do, I have mental illnesses. I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety way back, that’s never gone away. I’ve always feared that the other twin, depression, would come along one day. I think it’s happening now.

I’ve always been really self conscious. Ever since I was little. I’ve never really had much self confidence, although I have built some up a bit until recently. I was always “too pale” or had “too big a forehead” and the one that I still have a hard time with, “I’m too fat”. 

With depression, as you probably know, your diet habits change. Sometimes you eat more. Sometimes you eat less. I do both. I fast for around 16-20 hours, then eat for 4-8. I hate it, and I’ve been working on it. But I thought it was nothing. Then came the self loathing, but worse than before. I would stay up at night thinking about how ugly I am and all my flaws. I still do. Then came the irritability. I shrugged that off as a side effect for the chronic pain I had. Then finally, the hating myself. I find self loathing and hating myself different. Self loathing is about my appearance, while hating myself is about what I do, my life, my personality. 

This all peaked last week. Two girls who bullied me all through elementary had showed up. They weren’t mean or anything to me, but I remembered all they did. It was at a GSA meeting, something I love to go to. I wanted to leave early that day. My friend got angry at me. The next day I talked to her about it, and she said if I left it would ruin everything that day. Then she said it was a bulls**t reason to fight over. I cried in front of my friends for the first time ever, and boy did it feel terrible. Now I just can’t get happy again, no matter what I do.

I get a bit of a break at school when I’m with my friends. When I get home I try to do stuff to distract me. Baking always helps. At least, it did. Until when I baked a cake today for my school and it didn’t turn out perfectly. I cried. I still am a bit. This is when I realized I need help.

I know I need to go back to a therapist. I really do. The main hurdle is for me to ask my mom to go back, and to ask her not to go with me. I’m scared of all this, but I’m thinking I’ll do it soon. I’m going to try to talk to my friends about it, but I’m always the one there for them and I’m not sure how I feel about being the vulnerable one. I’m just so scared.",26Feb2020,1

34,"Something happened to me today that I don't think I've had happen before, at least not as strongly. I don't want a diagnosis or anything, I'm just not sure what that could have been and am pretty confused right now. 

So: Everything was pretty normal, nothing too stressful going on or something. 

However, suddenly, I got very nervous and angry. I was just putting some glasses away, and the sound of glass on glass made me so annoyed all of a sudden. I began to breathe more heavily and had this urge to choke myself to calm myself down. After a few seconds, it got too much and I had to rush outside, to somehow get away. I think I hyperventilated, my entire body was prickling, there were tears all of a sudden. It got better after a few minutes of controlled breathing.


But I wasn't really afraid of anything during this, I didn't feel like I was going crazy or dying or something similar - which, according to google, seems to be what panic attacks are.

So, what was that? A milder sort of panic attack? Or something else entirely? Should I even worry about this at all?

Thanks in advance",26Feb2020,1
35,"I feel like I've changed. I have always been a happy and outgoing kid, but things changed junior year of Highschool.  I started to feel so depressed. I snapped in and out of it sometimes I was in for months sometimes just a week. when I was out I was super happy and outgoing and even more so sometimes than before everything hit. I don't know why it started, it just did. During senior year when i fell in it would generally amount to an excruciating body contorting panic attack. this happened about every month.During the summer I was so happy and I was always surrounded by my great friends and wonderful girlfriend but  i  still couldn't kick the panic attacks. during college things have been bad. I am still super outgoing, im kind of known for it. but I can't remember the last time I've been happy for a month without going through at least a week of sadness. Another thing is that when i drop its getting more severe. I've had some pretty dark thoughts but have never done anything (except one time i ran until I passed out but I dont know if that counts). In all honesty I am still the outgoing passionate kid but i also feel like i am also this sad, empty lazy, unfocused person half the time. Before, I hated the other half the fallen in half, but now im not so sure about the passionate talkative half either.

for the record I run track and get plenty of excursive and sleep and my diet is good. I try to be a good person and am involved in volunteer work and am passionate about so much. Still, things just seem to get worse. THough I hate when people know about the other side as i try to keep it hidden best I can a couple peopple from home no but no one from college. I am lonely and I want to tell someone here about when I get sad, but I'm afraid they wont like that side. Who likes things like that I dont even like that side of me. 

I dont know whats wrong with me. I dont know if I am making this up, I dont know if this is just normal things that people go through and I am just being weak. I just want to feel happy about things  and I have no idea what to do or how to fix it.",26Feb2020,1
36,"So, I’m just gonna put it out there that I haven’t been officially diagnosed with any mental illness, I think I may have a slight anxiety problem seeing as I had frequent panic attacks as a child and still struggle with anxiety today. So I don’t know if this is the anxiety, or some other issue but I can’t really accept or believe the fact that my loved ones care about me. They reaffirm this often, and they show that they care, but I can’t help but think they all just pity me, and it’s all a lie. Usually thinking about this makes me spiral and it more or less ruins the next couple of days for me, and no one seems to notice or care which just makes it worse.

37,"Lately I have been feeling like I am worthless and that anything I do is just pointless because I'll never really get anywhere in life and that I should just die because it will make things easier for myself and the people around me. I know this isn't true, but it gets so hard to ignore waking up every morning and the only thing I can think is ""Why haven't I died yet?"". I don't plan on doing anything, but it does worry me because this is not the first time I've felt like this but before I actually had plans and it wasn't too hard to decide what I was going to do. 

I started college last September and my mental health spiraled out of control. I've become extremely anxious and depressed. Without meaning to, I lost 10 lbs in the first semester, which is a lot given that I wasn't overweight and I'm 5'1. I started controlling my food because it was the only thing I felt I could control. I hate eating in general, if I didn't have to to survive I don't think I ever would. I see myself as fat and unshapely, even though I know I'm not. My clothes from middle school almost fall off of me. 

There are times when I am just laying in bed, seemingly ok, and then my heart will start racing and I can't breathe and I feel like I'm going to pass out or just something bad in general is going to happen. Sometimes the feeling passes quickly, other times my whole day is shot because it lasts for hours. I can't ever risk getting bored because I become so extremely depressed that I can't even move in my bed and my brain feels like depressed, sad, mush and it also ruins my day or night. 

I don't really do much with friends given that all of my friends live on campus and I commute (I also hate being on campus). I try to find time to do things with my boyfriend but between work, class, and practice schedules, its almost impossible. I know he worries about me because over the years he's seen me go from decently happy and ok to the mess I am now, and I feel horrible that he worries. I don't want to cause him to feel the way I do. 

There's been a lot of things in my life that I feel have contributed to my mental health degrading; child abuse (mental, physical, and emotional), sexual assault, death in the family with horrible situations around it (threats of murder, pitting family members against each other, etc.), domestic violence, parental divorce, living with someone with mental illness, and several others. 

It's hard to tell others that I'm not ok because they see the achievements I've made, Dean's List first semester with 18+ credit hours, passing auditions with ease, and just appearing to manage college well. I also come from a family where, for almost my entire life, it wasn't ok to talk about how you feel or if you do you're punished and scrutinized, so I don't know how to deal with anything like this. 

I know I need help and I **want** to get help because I can't keep living my life like a zombie and just feeling so out of place everywhere I go. There's just something that is stopping me from reaching out to anyone. My college has free counseling services for students. I haven't been diagnosed with anything seeing as I have not gone to someone who can do it properly.  My mom is getting frustrated because I haven't gotten help yet, and makes comments like ""I'm not going to talk to you about anything like that because you refuse to make appointments."" and it honestly hurts. I do take birth control because my body can't regulate it's natural functions and I know that depression and anxiety are frequent side effects.  What are some things I can do to make myself want to *ACTUALLY* take the steps to get better?",26Feb2020,1
38,"Hey all.

Within the last 2 years, I lost someone very dear to me to suicide. I did as much as I could but still dont feel as though it was enough. I carry alot of guilt thinking i could have done more, even though I'm told by others I did as much as I could.

However, my friend had another friend who deals with depression / anxiety as well. And since their passing, will post quotes of things that say like ""no one cares about me"" ""people only care when theres drama"" etc.

This person is known to always have drama going. Always is the first to talk down to others. However I always try and go out of my way to see how they're doing. I always try to make plans and I'm constantly rejected. Now seeing these posts, I'm starting to get a bit pissed off. I feel as though it is drama hungry. This person constantly has others reaching out to them and when they do, he's rude as hell. And will never reach out to others or ask how they are.

I guess my question is: how do you deal with someone like this? Having lost someone I always worry and I think something's going to happen (suicide again). But it's like a constant scare and tbh I'm starting to get sick of being treated like shit when I try.

Do I stop reaching out? :(",26Feb2020,1

40,"I’m going to try and summarize this the best way possible. 

My ENTIRE. LIFE. I have struggled to see positivity. Literally as long as I can remember. I have been in and out of therapy. Numerous anxiety meds and was depressed as a teen. Went through some nice PPA/PPD recently. I don’t want to do self harm or anything like that. But holy shit do I struggle to see the light. 

Everything is so negative. Yadda yadda yadda life is not fair why me the whole deal is how I constantly feel. This entire year has been somewhat traumatic, I won’t go into detail but it’s just been various events and it’s like the hits do not stop coming. It’s a constant roll of getting hit in the face with bullshit. Some big things, but also a lot of little things and they just build up. Like power rangers when they say “it’s morphing time!” (I really try to find humor in anything). I know life has its ups and downs, but what if that’s all you ever feel? Literally the only positive I see in my life is my son. 

My husband and I have been fighting because he’s sick of my “negative ass mindset” and I am too. But I honestly do NOT know how to change it. I expect the worst out of everything, so when something good happens it’s like I hit the jackpot. It’s easier to not be let down or as upset when you just simply expect the worst. I know I need to do something but I don’t know what. I’m afraid it will eventually crumble my marriage because my husband is as optimistic as can be and I feel like an anchor. 

As a mom that works full time while my husband works an opposite shift, I don’t have time to go to therapy. Quite frankly I don’t have the money either, and honestly it never helped change my mindset probably because I couldn’t afford to keep going. Does anyone have anything they can contribute?

45,"Didn’t know where to post sorry if you guys don’t allow this here.

So i’ve had a really traumatic childhood, my mom was a suicidal addict which I was forced to care for (not even sure if this is related to it) and even shamed for while doing so by my entire family at a very young age (from around 9-14) and always would do this one thing: 

Every-time I heard my mother fall down (she would quite often, methadone was her DOC) I would say to myself “do this x amount of times and she won’t be dead and everything will be okay” these things included stuff like waiting x amount of seconds or not opening the door to go see her for x amount of seconds or even just really weird stuff like tapping a wall every second for 5 seconds or holding my breath for 3 seconds, just weird stuff.

I still sometimes do stuff like this and am not sure if it’s associated with the trauma or not. Something as simple as closing my eyes for 3 seconds and this won’t happen or having to watch a certain video I come across that I don’t even want to watch but I feel like if i don’t something I don’t want to happen will happen.

Anyone have any ideas what it could be? It feels like I have to do these things sometimes (usually not too often just sorta in stressful situations) or something just completely god awful will happen but still even if I do it I know it won’t change the outcome.

46,"As a child emotional guidance was never available to me. Neither my mother or father gave a flying shit about my emotional well-being, in their eyes as long as financial stability was met nothing else was of importance. My mother had BPD, her mind too busy to care about her own children. And my father who was an alcoholic, often out of anger he'd beat my older sister and I. My mother never tried to shield us from the abuse, the abuse was rarely directed towards her, as long as it wasn't happening to her, it was not a problem. Both my father and mother made sure to engage in verbal abuse, name-calling and shaming were not uncommon. Financial struggles made my father angrier, as a result, I hid avoiding any interactions with both parents. Spending endless nights alone, hidden. School didn't make things any easier, struggling to form friendships out of fear I remained alone. Teachers treated me like shit, classmates treated me like shit, my own family treated me like shit. I had formed an imaginary shield my head, ""Nobody can hurt you if you are alone."" Avoiding all sorts of emotional connection left me to deal with everything on my own from a young age.

I coped through self-harm and anorexia. Anytime somebody hurt me I'd cut harder, I'd starve more. All whilst maintaining an image of a studious straight-A student with a loving family. By High School, I promised myself to stop, and I did. Eventually, I dropped out and began doing online school. I could no longer deal with the lack of friends and being stepped on all over by teachers and classmates. I spent 3 years in solitude, zero friends, and barely any human interaction. Throughout those 3 years, the notion of self-reliance became stronger, I practiced healthy mental and physical activities. Exercising, eating healthy, meditating, and journaling nearly every day amongst having stellar academics. I was happier, my mother finally acknowledged her mental instability and acted upon it. My father found religion and quit alcohol, he left all of his abusive tendencies in the past. All of which have been amazing and it has been a slippery slope but one thing I have never had was emotional support, I have NEVER shown or told anyone about my self-harm scars or how I used to be anorexic or how my parents were domestically abusive or how I was treated like shit in school. I like to think I've overcome all of this, but I know frankly that is untrue. My current friends/relationships don't know about my past, I paint my past as what I wish it would've been.

47,"Firstly I want to introduce myself. 

I am a 22 year old college student. From the UK. I am extremely depressed and suicidal, I have Asperger's syndrome. I identify as a lesbian and I have an alcoholic father that I've cut off from my life for several years.

I will start from when my life started to go down hill. 
My first truamatic memory was when I was about 6 or 7 (I think), I saw my mother naked crying in the dark with a razor in her hand, there was blood dripping down her leg. The second truamatic memory was seeing my mother being physically hit violently by her now ex husband.

3rd truamatic memory was when my dad watched porn when I was sleeping Infront of me. 4th, my dad telling me my mum and uncle was raped by her father and that he is a pedophile (I remember as a child he'd take is top off and tell me to lay on him, but he didn't touch me sexually).

5th Hearing my dad and another woman have sex upstairs for hours extremely loud. (He would sleep with a lot of woman and cheat on them). 6th being threated by a drug addict mother and being around drug addicts as a child in a 22 floor high story flat. 

7th seeing my mother on drugs as a child, and her being aggressive to me even on the streets and no one did anything or said anything. 

8th I was neglected by food from my mother and father. 9th my scizophrinc Grandma being aggressive and constantly in a confused state talking to herself about messed up things. 


10th i used to take photos of myself naked at 14 years old for men online. But I never told a lot of  them my age.

11th at 15 I met a girl online who was a year older than me, he ended up verbally abusing me online. Making fun of my sexuality and disablity, I cut myself for the first time.


12th at 16 My first ex boyfriend threatened to kill himself because I didn't want to be in a relationship with him anymore. I ended up in A&amp;E.

13th I was homeless at 17-18, my mother would verbally and Phsycologically abuse me. I went to stay at a guy's flat that I just met online, his ex girlfriend who he lived with was jealous and angry at me constantly, I cut myself to relief the pain, she found out. I woke up to police officers around me asking me questions. As went to the A&amp;E.

14th later on a few years later at 18-19, him at the time being my boyfriend raped me. 

15th I tried to plan many suicide attempts, wrote suicide notes. I planned to jump a bridge twice. Thought about hanging myself from the door that had a window above the door to tie it around. 

16th at 20-21 I went into a relationship with a girl, she took advantage of my money. Was aggressive towards me. She broke up with me from Facebook messager while she was in Rome with her friends. 

17th I bought sustainable climbing rope online, looked around in a Forrest to see where the most quietest place was to do it and best tree. And looked up how to hang myself for real. There was a breathing technique that could make you pass out to achieve a partial hanging. I considered this.

I suppose college and getting back on my feet again helped.

18th I started using cocaine, I ended up mixing it with weed and I started hallcinating and needed go to hospital. My father (the alcoholic) showed up. I said I didn't want to see him and he left.

19th during college quite reccently last month, I was having a causal relationship with this girl from college in another class. She would emotionally manipulate me, and put me down about everything possible. She was toxic. As I was about to break it up she got raped. I ended up having to cut contact because she was making me stressed and anxious constantly being aggressive towards me.

20th my mother got into Christianity, she told me that being gay is a sin. I had a nervous breakdown in the toilets in my college, I told her I want to die. And I feel ashamed for being gay. She told me that's not what she meant, that for her it's a sin. But I put it into perspective for what it's like to be gay, having old men stare and get aroused by seeing young girls kiss, hold hands and hug etc. 


There has possibly been a lot more truamatic things that have happened that I have forgotten. My mood has always been unstable, I've been on medication since I was 14. I also used LSD, Shrooms, Adderall.

I am on my way to an art school undergrad degree, once I pass my next course for higher national certificate.. accidemically I am exceeding somehow.

I have so many bad patterns and habits that I wish would end but for the life of me I just can't stop. I'm in an episode right now, so everything is at its worst.

I've been with my husband for a bit over a year now and he means the world to me, but I'm so scared of my illnesses driving him away. I tend to push people away and shut them out when an episode starts. I know it hurts him, and I don't want to do it, but I still do. I hate myself for doing it. I don't feel like I deserve to be happy. My brain just tells me that I'm broken and not worth his time and energy. Anytime he makes me smile it hurts. I shouldn't be happy, but I want to be. I don't even know what happy is supposed to feel like anymore, it's been so long.

Not too long ago he joined the military. Lately I just feel angry. I feel like he left when I needed him the most. I had to finish my last semester of my associates degree alone, and have been trapped in my own head. Everything hurts and I don't have anyone to help me through it. I'm proud of him for everything he's accomplished, but I can't help but have some resentment for him leaving for so long. I love him so much, but being apart from him only makes things worse in my own head. I know his life would be so much easier if he was with someone who wasn't so broken. I don't feel like I deserve him and that he should be with someone else.",26Feb2020,1

Hard candy and stuff is fine but things like cake, brownies, pastries, sweet cereal(cap n crunch, frootloops, etc) ice cream, snacks like twinkies, muffins, ho ho’s, those chocolate-peanut butter wafers(nutty buddy’s?) Oreos, nutter butters, doughnuts, frosting, and other things of the sort. I don’t really know how to explain it but when I eat them my stomach will REALLY hurt for the rest of the day and the outsides of my upper arms like, around my shoulders feels idk... weird? Like tingly but not actually, almost like I’m imagining it but it’s still there. Sometimes if it’s really bad I’ll get a migraine (I already get those a lot, so idk it they’re directly correlated or they just tend to come on then) but people have always looked at me weird when I don’t get excited over them and I’m really tired of forcing myself to eat cake and other sweet things at party’s or at other people’s house to not seem ungrateful because the only excuse that I can offer is “i don’t like sweets” because I don’t wanna seem high maintenance. Does ANYONE know anything about what this is??? How I can fix it?? Maybe it’s psychological??? My friend suggested maybe it’s diabetes but I don’t know. It’s just a bit annoying cause while I don’t like some things like cake or twinkies, I do adore things like brownies or apple pie and vanilla ice cream but it kills me when I eat them. Literally ANY information you might know about this is welcome and wanted literally just plz help. I’m posting this to multiple subreddits but I’m also posting here cause maybe it’s just a psychological thing and you guys might know something about it?? All feedback appreciated plz and thx

53,"I struggle mainly with depression these days and it has a lot to due with my sexuality. Most of the things I struggle with boil down to me being gay or feeling undesirable as a gay man and I can't really talk with my family about this. I mainly say I'm feeling down due to issues with school, and while this is a part of it, a lot of what I struggle with I just don't tell them. They can tell I'm holding back and don't really communicate my feelings or when I'm feeling low with them properly. 

I feel like I'm slipping lately and am considering medication. My family of course doesn't take me seriously since they don't know the extent of my depression and suicidal thoughts. I've gone back and forth with them on why I feel they'r necessary, how I've researched the risks and am prepared to do the work meds can't do. They're still against it and it's making it hard for me to get them.

How should I talk to them without fully disclosing all my issues? Is there a healthy way to only share how you're feeling and working on your mental health without actually disclosing what it's about? How can I communicate my feelings with them better?

58,"Basically, I've been suffering from depression since I was about 15. When I would feel a depressive episode coming on, it wouldn't really affect my schoolwork as much; I went to an underfunded high school where the curriculum was a lot easier than it should've been, so making decent grades in school with minimal studying/work ethic was easy.

However, now that I'm in college and my classes are getting increasingly harder with every semester, I find that my former routine doesn't produce the same results (obviously). So nowadays, when I feel the depression starting to take over and my motivation and energy are beginning to slip away, I find it even more difficult to stay on top of schoolwork.

Does anyone have any advice or examples of what they do whenever they're in a similar situation but still have a lot of work to do? I have a midterm in 2 days that I haven't even begun studying for due to my current state, and the stress is actually pushing me further away from being productive rather than motivating me to start now.

I went on the minimum dose of Prozac three years ago in my freshman year of high school and felt fine for the entire time (granted, with some bad days). At the beginning of this school, I noticed a lot of the depression symptoms coming back, along with a lot of other things I hadn’t noticed before:

- Major anxiety and occasional panic attacks
- Constant worrying about suicidal thoughts I was having that were really inconsequential and not anything to be worried about from a logic perspective, because they never manifested themselves as a solid plan to end my life. Rather than giving me relief from my anxiety and depression, they just caused more panic.
- Having to repeatedly apologize when I did something wrong
- Having to have multiple people analyze situations for me to help determine whether I did something wrong
- Overanalyzing texts and emails, thinking that people were upset with me
- Obsessing about little details of things in my life

I'm emotionally and psychologically unstable (I've had two emotional breakdowns at my last job which wasn't even full-time), and experience fear in interacting with people outside my house except in very limited situations (work is not one of those).  
I know there are some types of work that people work from home through a computer or do freelance type projects or something similar. I was wondering if anyone with similar issues has experience with this type of work, even part-time would be fantastic and really be an encouragement.

64,"I'm not quite sure how to lay this all out there so sorry if this feels like a rant.

Looking back, 2019 was probably my worst year since my age hit double digits. I was working multiple jobs I hated while maintaining full time status as a college student, and at the tail end of the year my \~3 year long relationship with my girlfriend ended. In the moment none of it really seemed all too bad, the working multiple jobs &amp; dealing with school, but looking back I can see I was just too tired and stressed to really take a moment to examine where my life was at. After the breakup I tried therapy (I can no longer can afford it, but it helped a bit while it was there) and it helped with the initial shock of it all, but now I'm at a point where I'm no longer heartbroken and sad, I'm just... existing. 

A lot of the initial improvements I saw in my mental health after the breakup were motivated by a goal of self improvement in all the areas I saw that I had been lacking in the relationship. Now, as more and more time passes I feel like this motivation is running thin, and continuing to dwell on the relationship looking for areas to improve just makes me sad and I'd rather forgive &amp; forget for the most part. 

I'm trying to stay positive, but sources of enjoyment are far and few between. Things I used to enjoy like video games, exercise, cooking, or even browsing reddit/youtube are much less enjoyable than they used to be. Hanging out with friends is usually enjoyable, but life isn't so simple anymore and neither I nor my friends can afford to hang out enough to make me feel not like a ghost. Beyond that, I don't want my friends to feel as though they have to babysit me for fear that I won't be okay without them. I ***know*** that there is happiness to be found in my own company, doing things I love, but right now the energy to start/find what those things may be escapes me.

These days I'm still extremely busy. I'm working a job I admittedly enjoy, but it takes up nearly 30 hours a week spread unevenly across all 7 days, meaning I don't get any official days off. Even if the hours on any given day are minimal, I'm still spending at least to 3 hours + 1.5 hours commuting every day with work, and that's ignoring school obligations. I have a few close friends, and they're amazing. As an introvert, I've found it takes me a very very long time to open up to people, years even. Making new friends is really challenging because of this, not to mention the fact that I barely have any time to give to my current friends, so why would I waste the time? 

I just feel like everything I'm doing these days is because i'm *supposed* to be doing them, so its less about fun/peace and more about survival. Exercise? I do it so I have a reminder that I can't avoid eating like I tend to when I'm stressed. Cooking? Going out is too expensive, and again I have to have food available so I don't whither away. Work at a job I think I like? Welllll I'm mainly doing it because it will help my resume more than anything, and if I had the chance to quit I probably would. Where's the enjoyment in doing anything if you feel like you're forced to do it?

65,"not by choice, really. someone who cares about me made me email the school counselor i’ve seen before and tell her about how bad my depression has gotten within the past two or three months since i’ve seen her (and it was bad then - i don’t like therapy and i felt i had no other choices besides suicide) and about my eating disorder, which i hid from her when i saw her last.

she told me this was the worst she’s ever seen me, and almost started crying because of me. i barely spoke, i didn’t know what to say other than “i don’t want to feel like this anymore”. 

my significant other also had just told me he wants a break. for a good reason, to fix ourselves and our mental health, but he knew it was bad timing and didn’t think and it broke me.

she told me i most likely have ptsd.

and honestly, if that’s the case, it would take a huge weight off of my shoulders. i’ve been certain for so so many years i’m naturally just a fucked up and broken person. years of abuse led to me feeling like that, but i never even considered ptsd. i felt like you had to go through war, or a serious act of abuse. i guess i did, though.

she also wants me to go to an outpatient for disordered eating. he (my s.o., or i guess not s.o. anymore) is pushing me to as well.

my head is so full and i don’t know how many times i’ve broken down today. i’ve relapsed (both self harm and purging) today alone. there’s so much going on that i can’t even begin to make sense of in my head, but if that diagnosis really fits, at least it would give me that first stepping stone to making myself into the person i want to be mentally, for the first time in almost 8 years.",26Feb2020,1

My girlfriend was a very very insecure girl that just came out as bi and this person took her under her wing. 
It hurts me a lot that this pos has to this day a huge affect on my girlfriend. She is very insecure about herself. In addition to this, her past trauma caused a lot of tension in our relationship for ex, my girlfriend gets extremely upset about me talking to any female that she’s not familiar with. She even told me that she has absolutely no reason to not trust me but it’s the little voice in her head going off.

I have friends sure but I still still feel like I'm slowly going downhill until I one day cut everyone out of my life.  I have mild aspergers, enough that I'm not totally incapable of picking on social signals but more of so realise that hic-ups build up over time until one day you find yourself always the one to instigate the conversation and see what you've become.  It fucking hurts.

I started off University strong and part of me believed that I was actually able to change.  The thing about random people is that you can be whatever your Ideal version of yourself is and this gives you the opportunity to change.  

Slowly you realise that  the person you trying to change into isn't even possible. First year was great but now I can feel Im slowly starting to go down the same path. You can realise your sliding but there's nothing you can do to stop yourself.  The thing with Autism no matter how slight your always going to be fighting this uphill battle.  I always picture  in the future one day being happy but  slowly seems  like this goal is work of fiction.

74,"I don't know how to deal with these episodes. Things will seemingly be fine and out of nowhere she will become upset. They don't seem, to my untrained eye, to be caused by any particular moment.

It goes something like this:

Her and I will be having a nice time out drinking. It always involves alcohol. Things will be fine and many times she'll be very affectionate, kissing, hugging, etc. Then at some point when we're alone at home, a switch flips. She gets upset, frequently without me even saying anything beyond normal, mundane conversation. She then will get visibly upset and I'll naturally ask her what is bothering her. She will, without fail, scream that I should know what it is.

And then she gets violent. She'll punch me, claw, scratch, anything. My instincts tell me to hold her and tell her everything's ok, that she's safe. This rarely works.

For example, a couple nights ago this occurred. She repeatedly punched, scratched, and bit me until she finally told me she wanted to go home. I call her Mother to see if she can retrieve her. She finally calms down. Then tells me she's scared to go home and that she *NEEDS* me to go with her. I obliged, went with her and she held onto me that night as if her life depended on it.

She will sometimes recall the broad strokes of the moment. That she was upset or that I bothered her, but after NEVER remembers assaulting me. All I know about these events is that she seems to be so upset during them that she becomes completely unaware of the reality of her surroundings.

I am at a loss because I have been her best friend for years, we've been romantically involved most of that time, and I've never even raised a hand to her aside from attempting to deflect her punches from time to time. How can she become so distressed by my presence that this happens?",26Feb2020,1

Won’t get into details but at the same time, a very sad change happened in my life that I previously never would have been able to deal with. 

In any case, medication along with CBT and weekly psychology sessions (along with a lot of weed - not condoning this as a way to combat mental health issues, but it’s better then the other drugs that i use/used) have led to me feeling much better.

I’ve been on this planet for seventeen years and I haven’t figured out how to introduce myself to a stranger, I feel like a fucking disgrace to this species, when there’s so many out there who are suffering things so bad I can’t even imagine it, I have the audacity to be depressed and not go and live life, I have the gaul to be upset and not want to exist when I got to be the tiny bit of life in this universe. God I feel like shit, I just bother people with my issues, I fuck up every chance I have and I’m a waste of space, and a waste of people’s time. That’s all, I just wanted to vent for a bit, I feel a little better now. sorry about this being one mess of a post but I just needed to do something that wasn’t crying in bed",26Feb2020,1
81,"Growing up as a kid, even though my parents got divorced in my early childhood leaving my dad ""homeless"" to this day and my older sister picking on/bullying me and a bunch of other things, I was known by many as a bright, talented kid who was very social and outgoing. When I was about 13, I was brutally cyberbullied on a semi-popular game creating site that I still use to this day and am very popular on. When I was 15, I ended up losing my v-card at the wrong time to someone about 5 years older than me and that impacted me in a way, especially because of how young I was and unprepared of the emotions that I would deal with afterwards, and having to talk to law enforcement and authorities in front of my family. At the age of 17, I escaped from a toxic relationship with a smart girl and afterwards she ended up being dominant over me and bullied/threatened me to the point where I was sent to the principle's office for my suicidal thoughts at the time.  


Regardless of all of those scarring things in my life, I managed to keep everything under my belt throughout high school and graduated feeling proud and grateful of all of my accomplishments that I made, such as being around the top 50 in my class with a 4.3 GPA, being one of the school's greatest musicians in band/jazz band, earning my Eagle Scout, etc. I decided to go into on the of the top universities in my state, but was placed into a small campus in a bad city with an undeclared major. The first semester was great for me in terms of the social activity I had, but my grades weren't due to choosing terrible classes and professors who were uncaring about their students' performance. I was placed on academic probation which left me broken for a small period due to my below average performance.  


Since my campus is much smaller and has a small dorm community that is optional for people to sign up for (since they expect commuters to go here), people started leaving to the main campus or another campus, dropping out, or just attending school regularly and not living in the dorm. The annual parties that we had started to come to a close, and I started to lack the opportunity to connect and socialize with others more.

\_\_Even though I did much better in the next semester, my mental (and physical) health started declining at the fastest pace that I've ever seen it.\_\_ I placed myself into an English class that required public speaking on a daily basis, and on the first day, for some reason, I was just too anxious to speak. Every time I was required to speak, I started blanking for long periods, sometimes not even saying a single word because I was just too scared and feeling judged to speak. I started making noticeable gulping sounds and tried my best to hide it but couldn't. This all made me want to drop out, but regardless, I still kept pushing so I could get off of academic probation, despite all of the extreme embarrassment that I had to face every class. Sometimes I randomly look back on those ""extreme embarrassments"" and cringe and hate myself so much for it. In my last semester, I thankfully didn't have as much public speaking to do in any of my courses, but when I did, I still felt the same way and did the same anxious habits. I also ended up doing well that semester.  


I am now in a new semester. I have finally declared a major, which is American Studies, but unfortunately I still feel the same way. There are 2 classes that I'm in now that require public speaking, and it's like they'll choose on you if you do not raise your hand or say anything. The anxious person that I am, I end up blanking or saying little when I have things to say or get chosen to speak randomly. One particular class that I'm in is small with 7 other students in it. Every time that I have to attend this class, I feel very awkward and socially anxious, and the worst part is that it's about 3 hours long. In fact, this class happens every Wednesdays (today) so I'm already very anxious about attending it again. It is very obvious that I'm the most anxious person in this class and every time I am chosen to speak, I can't find anything to say and everyone just looks at me with a concerned face.  


Since I was taught to ""be a man"" growing up, I grew a habit of holding back my tears whenever I needed to cry. My anxieties that I faced in the beginning of this semester were so immense that I cried so hard for the first time since November 2018. I wanted to run away, I even wanted to hang myself on the spot because I just can't deal with this all anymore. I locked myself in the bathroom, roommates were not around fortunately and just bawled my eyes out on the toilet just hoping that I can one day overcome these anxieties that I can't help but show anymore.  


I'm in a small friend group here at my dorm in which we all get together every week to play some video games and it's like I feel more relaxed with them since I know them well. I don't do drugs because of my high reputation so I don't smoke weed, I don't drink, but they all do mostly on a weekly basis. I don't really feel left out because of that, but sometimes I also feel awkward and anxious when I'm with them.  


Last night we played again together, and a random wave of depression hit me after maybe about a month without feeling depressed in any way. I couldn't really play right because thoughts were clouding my mind and they kept making comments about that like ""you can only play one character"", ""you keep spamming the same moves"" and just grew really upset about it and fought back some tears. I was ready to just run back to my room at one point but I couldn't because I knew that I would start bawling my eyes out immediately and they would notice. They did kind of notice my behaviors and said things like ""What's wrong with you, \*\*Dan\*\*?"" (since that's my real name), and I just can't seem to fully explain it.   


Each day that goes by has started to traumatically impact me in some ways and has been making me more and more anxious and depressed as time goes by. Currently, I feel very depressed: there are noticeable bags under my eyes from not only the poor sleep that I have been having, but from all of the tears that I have also been holding back recently. I cannot really walk around as well as I was a few days ago. I feel ill and I have had lymph nodes swelling in different places, along with some shooting nerve pain in particular areas. I cough every day. This world really sucks sometimes, and it's just getting worse and worse. It doesn't even snow where I live anymore due to climate change, which is even more depressing because winter has always been my favorite season and my only chance to really motivate myself to workout and shovel. It's like I've permanently lost most of my confidence in everything and can't retrieve it, or fix it. I refuse/am scared to see a therapist or doctor, I refuse to go on medication if I'm diagnosed with anything serious/mental issues. I want to live in a world where depression and anxiety is non-existent and I can just be me again. I've even started to struggle speaking around my family. \*\*This sucks. I really, do not know what happened.\*\* I'll probably die from a weakened immune system, cancer, or even this new coronavirus that's been going around. I read a post on here that says ""Not everyone is supposed to live"". Oh, how much I can relate to that. As I said, it just gets worse and worse. I blame the obvious and vast carelessness that we've all evolved into.",26Feb2020,1

83,"I lately made a really good new friend who I have spent a lot of time and started to fall in love with, but I have problem that I just can't get it to my head that someone would actually purely enjoy and want to spend time with me and I keep getting scared that it will just disappear again because I'm being to pushy or needy. I'm stuck in mindset that I need reassuring from them that I'm worth spending time with... And I know it's not right to make someone else reassure you of your self worth. 

I also go too easily to speculation mode and I can only see negative outcomes of things and it can ruin my whole day and give me really bad anxiety.

Access to better mental health and their mental well-being are critical to keeping them safe from depression and anxiety. Depression is estimated to affect more women with disabilities, with estimates ranging from 30% to 59%. According to Healthy People 2010, women with disabilities were more likely to show feelings of sadness, unhappiness, or depression, which discouraged them from being active, compared to women without disabilities.

86,"Hey everyone. I’ve been dealing with severe/clinical depression for awhile now and have been taking Zoloft for about a year. I used to be in really good shape and over the past 5 years since my depression got really bad, I’ve probably gained over 100 pounds. 

I’m 24 years old, 5’7 and weight around 260 pounds. Depression and side effects from Zoloft make it so hard to motivate myself to workout let alone even having the energy to do so. 

I feel like I have anxiety around working out too and have always been self-conscious even when my health was at its best. I have been trying to get back into working out but I either have no energy or I just have a panic attack just thinking about getting back into it.

87,"Superheroes and their superpowers are really just one side of a coin, with the other side being all of the contemporary alleged mental disorders such as ADD, ADHD, and all forms of autism etc.

Why you ask, well what are superpowers? They are essentially handicaps... And what are mental disorders? They are also handicaps, and that superhero comics etc. arose during the first half of last century at about the same time as or a bit after modern psychology/psychiatry was getting started, is only further evidence of this likely intentional correlation that would have been designed for purposes of highly profitable media of all kinds as well as the contemporary pervasiveness and detrimental influence of the psychiatric profession, which would no doubt feed off of and bolster each other through this unforseen but fundamental link.

The superhero/mental handicap correlation is partiularly evident when you look at who is being cast as Bruce Wayne in the new Batman movie in development (hint: It ain't Jason David Frank), as if the throwback to the old 'nipplesuit' George Clooney films with the [metrosexual boofhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Affleck) Batman from the last two movies wasn't bad enough.",26Feb2020,1

I went through all the music and albums myself yet I still thanked the dude for getting me into the band. The thing that bothers me is that they didn't get me into the band and the fact that I thanked him makes me feel like I owe the guy for getting me into pantera. I dont know why it matters but I feel satisfaction in having music that I found myself. I have no Idea why it matters but whenever I listen to that band I think of the time the dude mentioned them.

My biggest conflicting mindset is I tend to think people offering me care ALWAYS have another person in their lives they will care more for, so I fear abandonment in a sense. I guess I abandon them before they have the chance to do that on me, avoiding potential emotional scarring.

I always destine myself to being alone because I am just completely blind to my self-worth, believing I am worthless regardless of the numerous people throughout my life time that suggested otherwise. And as a result I just end up suffering in silence because I have no one to talk to, kinda like a person suffering from quiet BPD.

I don't want to go into details but I just need to vent a few things and since I closed all my social media I don't have access to any support groups but the one's here in reddit, plus the anonymity makes me feel safer.
So far, only my mother, sister and one friend know, and I guess the girl who did it too. My family has been pressuring me to open up and go to therapy but I just don't feel ready yet, and everytime they begin to insist I just completely block and seek isolation, but they won't stop.
My mom even went as far as to schedule an appointment with my therapist without my concent, which made me really angry and I immediately told her to cancel it.
I have barely spoken more than a few words in days, this here is the most open I've been about it since it happened, and I have been feeling suicidal, anxious and empty. I can't stop thinking about it 24/7.

My biggest fear is catching HIV or AIDS, as this ""friend"" has a very active sexual life, and my city has the highest amount of HIV cases in the whole state.
In my colleague alone there have been 400 reported cases of HIV in the last 2 years.
I'm set on the idea that if I test postive I will kill myself, I have thought about it, and I don't want to live like that, I'd rather die.
I am very afraid, but I just can't open up to anyone in my life right now, I can't even let my own mother hug me. I used to be very affectionate and wouldn't go a day without hugging someone, now I don't think I can ever go back to that, I don't feel it in me anymore.

99,"A little bit of background: I have been diagnosed with bipolar 2 and ADHD for 7 years and have many struggles with that, but recently, things are a different kind of bad.

Objectively, I can look at my life and see things are improving. At age 25, I have $50000 saved and no debt, a wonderful, supportive fiance, a good support system of friends, and I've repaired my relationship with my parents and finally feel a sense of support from them. Despite that, I consistently feel worse every time I should feel better. 

I recently left my job. I hated the work and wasn't passionate about it (I was in management, while i am an introverted, analytical person). My mental health was deteriorating quickly at that job and my fiance helped me build up the courage to quit. Before that, I had already decided I was going back to school to pursue my masters in applied statistics starting fall 2020. This was as of December 6, 2019. Immediately after leaving, I went to see my psychiatrist for the first time in over a year, and have since been put on adderall and depakote.   Since then, I am always either sad or stressed.

I feel ashamed that I don't have a job, despite the fact I'm preparing for grad school, and my fiance encourages me to relax as we have savings and she makes enough to cover bills.

I feel stressed at the thought of taking Student loans, despite the real possibility of getting a scholarship or Assistantship, and the fact that my savings could cover all of the loans if I wanted to go that route 

I feel sad that I can't find the motivation to do anything most days, despite the time I have right now.

I'm frustrated I can't get myself to be reasonable and even try to see my situation for what it actually is.

Worst of all, I'm just so upset that I always live my life thinking I'm just a disappointment to everyone I care about.

I never really felt guilty about things I “did wrong” and I never really understood others emotions when it came to the morality of situations. I honestly think morality is a societal concept fabricated to keep us in line but that’s a whole other discussion i guess. The only time I did feel ashamed was when I was about 9 I strangled a cat with a rope I didn’t kill it though. I felt bad because I was always told doing something like that was wrong, I think the indoctrination to morality effected me more than the actual morality of the situation because I didn’t really feel empathy towards the cat, though I do recognize it was wrong and I never did it again.

•I dislike eye contact, I can make it, it just makes me uncomfortable I kind of have to just force myself, and if I do force myself I feel extremely nervous and I’m not sure why I think it’s because people since I was a young kid would always tell me how “big and pretty” my eyes were and I’m scared they’ll make someone attracted to me or something? I do it with everyone though even family and friends 
• I’m ashamed of my sexuality I think, not like that I’m bisexual but I think maybe because I was raised religious or something I’m just ashamed of anything sexual That has to do with me, I haven’t taken nudes in months and it was something I used to do all the time, I don’t even like the idea of having sex right now with anyone even people I’m attracted to and I don’t masturbate like at all or watch porn or anything anymore at all really I just kinda feel like a gross animal all the time if that makes sense even though I know it’s a natural thing and I wouldn’t really care about anyone else watching porn or anything so I’m not sure why I feel like that
•I go on long periods of either feeling sex repulsed (like for months sometimes) or the opposite but they’re usually a lot shorter lasting like just a couple weeks

108,"Hey all. 

Hope I’m doing this right but wanted to get some advice. I’m a healthy 24 year old with quite a successful job for my age and I’m fit and healthy. I suffer from a severe form of tinnitus that doesn’t go away or calm down (due to ear problems). This affects my sleep to the point I average on around 4 hours a night. 

I’d say maybe every other month I sink into a few day’s of what I can only assume is a depressive episode. My mood flips and I’m so low I don’t see the point in carrying on. My uncle and cousin both took their own lives so there’s definitely mental illness in the family.  

I went to the doctors and was brushed off and told ‘it’ll pass’. And that was about it. I guess I’m one of the lucky ones because the mood does pass but I just wondered if anyone had any advice and I’m feeling a bit useless and have no idea how to move past them. 

Thanks all

110,"I'm here because I need to vent and to be honestly I dont really know who else to talk to, hopefully this is the right place. Sorry this is a little all over the place. A little background, i have anxiety and depression (along with a few other health issues, the one relavant to the story being issues with my joints popping out of place, specifically my knee, but also several other non weight bearing joints. My otho, psyical therapist, and old primary care doctor narrowed it down to more likely than not being a connective tissue disorder, along with my skeletal structure being a little weird) and I've been on basically the same meds since I was 14, over time things have been added and the doses increased, but ive been on a fairly stable medication plan that at the very least keeps me functional. Its definatly not perfect and I still struggle to function sometimes but on my meds I can get out of bed, out of the house, and interact with other people. My insurance recently began requiring we use their in house medication service for meds or they wont cover it, which means I can't pick up my final 9 months of pills from my old doctor (I moved semi recently and never got around to finding someone to repercribe my anti depressants/anxiety meds.)

 I found a doctor who had an opening like 5 days after I called and was super close to my house. I was thrilled. I went into the appointment open to changing meds if I needed to, simply because I was still really struggling with symptoms of anxiety and depression. I get in do all the new patient stuff. I sit down with the doctor, he confirms my name, looks at my chart and says ""did you know zoloft causes weight gain?"" I wasnt particularly shocked by the sudden left turn of the conversation to weight,, (i am definatly overweight, and I'm working hard to get more exersize and eat better. It's something I'm very sensitive about and something that has kept me away from doctors for a long time, when I was in middle school I developed an eating disorder after my pediatrician refused to send me to physical therapy for my constantly dislocation knee until I lost weight, so that's what I did. I developed some very problematic eating habits. I got through that, after getting treatment, and joining a very demanding sport that required me to eat a better diet so I could function. I also wasnt to suprised that zoloft causes weight gain, although the initial prescribing doctor didnt tell me that (likely because I was 14 and at the time had recently been treated for an eating disorder)). So I simply said that I had suspected that, and that my weight was something I had struggled with, and was currently actively working to change. I tried to convey in that, that it wasnt something I was interested in discussing, but apparently I didnt do a very good job of that. 

He drops it and continues asking general questions about my mental health, and general health, he asks if I've ever had surgery, I say that yes, I've had two surgeries to correct a dislocating knee cap, figuring this isnt particularly relavant and we will move on. But no, he begins on a tangent about how I am far to young to have had two knee surgeries, and that the doctors were wrong to have done surgery on me. He then goes on to explain that his daughter had a dislocating knee cap too, and that the only thing that she needed to fix it was physical therapy and to loose weight, and that all the issues I have with my knee can be solved the same way. During the rant I manage to cut in and quickly explain that surgery had been decided after I had lost significant amounts of weight and done 6 years of physical therapy. He dismissed what I've said, tells me he knows women are sensitive about their weight and reiterates that all of my problems will be solved if loose weight. 

He continues, saying that hes going to cut my zoloft in half to help me loose weight, and double my dose of welbutrin. Now like I said in the begining, I went in open to changing my meds, but in the past zoloft has been the most impactful on helping with my depression and anxiety, and although a small dose of welbutrin is helpful for getting me motivated and doing things, when I was on a higher dose I found it made me very jittery and increased my anxiety. I tried to tell the doctor this, but he dismissed me saying that a higher dose of wellbutrin would probably help me loose weight, and give me some extra pep.  Honestly I just kind of quietly nodded and left. 

At this point I kind of feel like I'm being punished for being over weight, like I dont deserve the privilege of being mentally stable because of it. Part of me knows that's not what's happening, and I'm trying to believe that this guy knows what hes doing, and is trying to help. And who knows maybe the med switch will overall be a good thing, maybe hes right and this is what I need but I honestly have my doubts. The entire experience was pretty horrific. I know I need to find a new psychiatrist because this guy made me incredibly uncomfortable, but honestly the whole process was so overwhelming that part of me just is too exhausted to go through it again, I'm going to give the meds a chance, see what happens. I have a friend who I'm fairly sure sees the same psychiatrist so I'll probably talk to him and see if this is how he is, or if it was just a weird interaction. I think that regardless I need to find someone else, because I just didnt click with him, and part of me knows that it's important to find someone I am able to talk to and feel heard, but also the idea of calling the office and being like ""hey I didnt like the dr I saw, do you have anyone better"" is deeply uncomfortable to me. 

If you have advice I'm open to it (I live in the us) I just cant tell if I am being overly sensitive about it, or not, maybe I am over reacting. I cant tell anymore.",26Feb2020,1

113,"First thing I live in a third world country and there is very very less awareness about the mental heath issues. Even so that I actually don't have any therapist in the town that I live in right now and there are about 5-6 mental health clinics in the whole country all in the biggest city. 

Almost 3 years ago, I moved into a bigger city for my further studies. I was around 16 then, and that was my first experience living away from my parents. Until then I lived in a small town where we all knew each other and there was so much bonding with each other. I normally knew most of the people on my 10 min walk to the school. As you can guess I was not prepared for the dreaded lifestyle of the big cities and it very hard for me to adjust to the lifestyle. And also I really couldn't connect with anyone properly. And grew up to be socially awkward and introverted. I lived in a hostel and the first year was very tough. There were not many people who I could talk to and I only enjoyed my time at college where I had 2-3 friends. The rest of the time at hostel just felt so lonely and sad. I just tucked myself in a blanket and watched movies nonstop or studied. I usually went up days with not talking to anyone even my roommates.  I always felt tired and not well rested. 

And the people in the hostel were so keen on proving everyone that they were the supreme beings and everyone else was a lowlife. I never really got into that. So, I basically avoided them for a year. I turned from a happy and cheerful guy to a person filled with void and negative thoughts. It affected my studies and my health as well. I looked like I was sick for months. I did also start to hate myself for it and also hate everyone else.   
The next year I switched the hostel and found really amazing friends who did enjoy my presence and I did theirs too. I slowly started to heal myself and started to be a bit more positive. 

Now I look at myself and compare it to the one who was happy and cheerful. We are miles apart. But I am beginning to embrace myself. I have become a lot more introverted and calm. I do tend to overthink sometimes but I just talk to my friends or girlfriend. And I am not really sure how to look upon that time. I never met any therapist so I do not know if that was depression. And if it was not for that time would I be who I am today? And was it just so easy to recover from being in such a dark place? I do wonder about those things and find no answers?",26Feb2020,1

128,"important background:

i go to a university that offers free counseling services to its students. i have used their services 2times: once as an agreement with my high school therapist since she could not longer see me, and once to work through my anxiety post breakup. the first time i did intake sessions with 2 separate therapists (actual practicing therapists, not students) and they agreed that my needs exceeded what the center could provide and they referred me out. the schools center is adamant that they do not provide long term care. (pin this for below). the second time i went though a lot of bullshit 20 minute intake sessions with a psych student doing her (whatever the psych equivalent of a residency is) and she was so unhelpful, so robotic and rehearsed, and it was just a waste of my time. she even left for a long break after 4 sessions so i would have been given a NEW student to get acclimated to. so i stopped going. yes, i went in with a goal in mind and i was absolutely ready to put the work in and i was very open minded. it was objectively a shitty experience. 

current issue:

im pretty depressed, overwhelmed because i graduate in a few months, having troubles with my mom, and i think i’m bipolar. i really would love to talk to someone about even one of these things so i can stop constantly thinking about it - i need to talk it out. i’d also like insight on if i might actually have bipolar (ii) and if so, what are my next steps. my only option is the schools center bc i’m living paycheck to paycheck on crappy student wages part time. however...

based on my previous experiences i’m not even sure it’d be worth it. i see it going this way: i get paired with a student instead of a real therapist. they are as scripted and inexperienced as my last one. i waste my time with more intake sessions than should be necessary, especially since all my info is on file twice from me and twice from my old therapists. by the time i establish a relationship with my assigned therapist, i’m getting too busy to go with my senior project and i’m about to graduate. i feel like it’ll just discourage me. 

should i wait until i graduate and get a full time job so i can pay for a private practicing therapist? or should i go through the rigmarole of the free student services and hope i don’t get denied, immediately referred out, or i wait so long for a full session that i’m about to graduate and it was this whole lengthy process for nothing?",26Feb2020,1

This helped me see clearer into my own feelings,  but I feel I've only scratched the surface of who I am.

I know INFJs tend to be hard on themselves, to always seek perfection in their relationships, finding meaning in their lives in general, I've started to work on myself on these points, but still I can't seem to feel at happy with my life. The things that bring me  the most joy are my writing, which give me a sense of purpose, and  every activities that keeps my mind off of reality, such as music, video  games, reading, and in some way sports. Seeing my friends always makes  happy, thank god. When I'm doing these, I feel very happy most of the  time, but as soon as they stop, I feel all those negatives emotions  slowly coming back, like when clouds start to cover the sky and the air  feels heavy. I get sad again, feel like I don't belong anywhere, and  start questioning every single aspect of my life all over again. And  sometimes even if I do something to take my mind of things, the cloud is  still there in my head. Sometimes when I get stressed or anxious and I  manage to calm myself down, I feel these emotions again afterwards,  without any apparent reason.

I get and got this feeling in many others circumstances. I hate having to go  to work, because once there I'll start to overthink my life, despite  being focus on the task I'm performing. I hate having to find a job,  because many of them never make me fulfil or content. I hate going to  sleep, because sometimes when I'm trying to fall asleep, I overthink my  life again, daydream, and feel lonely. Even with my friends, I sometimes  feel I'm less than them, or that they wouldn't care if I stopped seeing  them.

There are good days though,  and time when I feel very happy and content, I cherish these moments  and periods of time, but overall I feel either neutral, sad, or  cloud-minded. This is annoying me and getting me down, because I can't  focus or understand what is wrong. Is it me? Is it my life style? Or  something else I need to change?

I'm  sorry if this post is too vague, but I tried my best to express myself. Does anyone relate to this feeling? What should I do in your opinion?",26Feb2020,1

139,"Had to make a throwaway account as ive never opened up about myself online before. Im currently 21, soon to be 22, studying in my masters year of uni in a course i know ill end up not using. I've had mental health issues from the age of 14, when i was younger i used to cut myself and carve words into my legs or places nobody saw. I had home issues, my parents would often fight and my dad would often take it out on me.     Ive had anxiety issues and battles on and off with depression since i was 14. I can remember exactly how i felt at that age, similar to how i feel now with so much anger and hatred for myself and people around me. As i got older i learned to control my feelings better and eventually started dating at around 16/17. I thought i had a good thing going but as relationships at that age go, it fizzled out before a year. When i went to university i thought this would make or break me, if i couldnt enjoy living in my own skin during what's meant to be the best time in your life then whats the point. I met a girl in my first year, we clicked immediately and started dating. She wasnt my first relationship but we quickly began dating and seeing each other 24/7. We fell in love and i realised for the first time how different a relationship can be when youre that bit older and have deep rooted feelings for someone. For the first time in my life,  i felt truly accepted and loved and cared for. We split up prematurely and it really broke me. For a year i would cry myself to sleep, often contemplating suicide at the thought of not seeing her again or feeling that loved again. Two and a half years have passed since then, and im still single. I've seen other people in that time and had a few one night stands but every girl i spend time with doesn't give me that same spark that i once felt. I have no feelings or lingering desire to see my ex during this time although i kept finding myself comparing people to the way i felt when i met her.

Last week my ex tragically died in a road accident. I hadn't thought about her for a while, but the news hit me harder than i ever thought it would. This whole week has been a real strain on me mentally. I'm expected to hand in essays next week but every time i wake up i think of our relationship and the person i loved in that car. Its so fucked and i know its not normal or healthy but its what i feel. It just reinforced to me how fragile everything is, in that anyone could die at any time.

I didn't really know how to end this or explain myself further but i just wanted to write about where i am mentally atm. I knew i couldnt get real support from my friend circle as they simply have never known me to have any underlying issues as i hide everyday. I think ive reached the point of having little to no self esteem, and find it hard to relate to my friends happiness which makes me feel even more broken and almost like a fraud trying to fit in.

142,"This is my first ever reddit post so may not be posting in the right section and This is going to be lengthy but will try to stay as concise as ever. 
I think I am a truly messed up human being as a result of others with selfish agendas. 
I really need to talk about my life somehow somewhere. 

Quick Flash I’m 26[M] and I’ve been facing the same personal life issues for so long now that I don’t know what my take on it is anymore. 
I was born in London, moved to America at the age of 6 left there at the age of 13( moved from state to state while there because of my stepdad ), moved to Africa and was there 5 years but spent each year in a different school thanks to my unruliness. Moved to England at 18 and went straight to boarding school, then straight to uni, dropped out after 3/4 years of not accomplishing anything but repeated years. Ran to NY for a year because someone offered me a better life, didnt work, under the mercy of my father to leave NY, got sent to Africa as a punishment and then eventually returned back to the UK. 

To start with my mother; 
My mother always put her relationships before me. Growing up, I was always moving from one continent to another and even while in one continent, constant moves were always made for various reasons. I say this because the start of my life was always on a temporary basis. I accepted in a way that all things , situations and all people were always going to be temporary. It came as a shock knowing that people actually grew up together or had memories of at least more than a year together. 
Now I’m going to emphasise here that in my current lifetime, the faintest memories I have being a child have held more golden to me than any moments being an adult and that’s just because I knew I was truly happy and didn’t know what was ahead of me. 
At age 13,  I left living with my mother to move to Africa to meet my biological father and his side of the family. The reason for this move was  because I had become so much of a nuisance in America and the African  culture was to Instil some discipline into me. 
This move again was the hardest for me because I was actually having to start life again but without my mother. 
Although I moved to Africa, my father resided in England with his wife so I was left at the mercy of my aunts, uncles and grandparents who all agreed for me to go straight into boarding school because I could influence their kids(my cousins). 

I found boarding school in Africa so hard because of the culture shock and bullying. Also being a less developed country I started to feel miserable remembering my old life. I eventually adapted learning a few bad subtle traits that have stuck with me till today. 
Not entirely knowing my father,I’d see him briefly whenever he’d travel back for a business trip or whatever so no real relationship in my opinion has ever been developed. I feel like he assumed the father role rather than actually trying  to become one to me. 

I would also like to say that my personality and character in the time, started to become less and less and less of me because I lost focus of who I was trying to make sense of my environment, trying to please those around me because I was dependent on them, trying to adapt to a culture that wasn’t known to me, trying to be liked and not bullied, trying to be a pleaser. I never felt good enough being myself.  
This did not play well for me when I realised I liked animals and had a passion for them. When I’d speak about it, I’d be told things like there’s no money in the animal industry, who wants to work with animals, you’ll never be rich, even my step mother (fathers wife) told me to research how to become a meat inspector when I didn’t get the grades for learning veterinary. This really broke me. Her vindictive,manipulative, uncaring, condescending, bitchy way/ of talking and treating me really got the best of me especially as my father couldn’t perceive her behaviour and I didn’t know any better than to try and keep pleasing her who would not accept me genuinely. This has really played an issue in my life because I can’t take someone’s opinions with open mind. I constantly compare myself to everyone and anything. Even if my girlfriend likes the lyrics of a song I’d take it personal  ‘just because’. 

Sorry for diverting there, I’m so sensitive about what I’ve been through. 

Moving on, after secondary school in Africa, I came to England with creating a relationship with my father at the back of my mind. 
I personally wanted to do my a levels living at home so I could be mentored but my step mother suggested looking at boarding schools and this became the ideal. 
So again I never got to develop a close relationship with him or anyone long term because again I was passed on. 

I also would like to say that my fathers side of the family is pretty well off financially as opposed to my mothers side which is quite mediocre in comparison. I say this so you understand my next point. 

After moving over to Africa to live under the influence of my paternal family, life did  really get better thanks to the wealth. I made a wrong decision to think I was entitled to such a lifestyle and got comfortable with not needing to do anything for myself but just be alive.  I really liked their lifestyle. It’s all they showed me. Go to boarding school, get money from us and just be alive. That’s how I was programmed. And being raised in Africa, I never got into routine of job seeking, exploring, thinking about my future, planning etc, I greatly lacked such skills and still do to today.  I am so lazy 

What is my character like now? 
At first glance and meet, you would take an instant liking to me. I am well spoken, articulate enough to give the impression you like the likes of me. I also give off the vibe I am going places, destined for greatness and talented. I am the perfect person to be questioned about myself because I can give perfect answers. 

But I am not that person. I am stoic in nature I am very weak inside. Believe very little in myself. Think about the thought of suicide but can never attempt. Always feeling like a victim, very defensive and almost jealous of progress that’s not mine. I want to be a great achiever I want peace of mind, genuineness happiness and to love. But I am completely damaged the light at my tunnel may be coming from the light of the end of another tunnel. Angry at the family I’ve been born into. Feel outcasted and unsought 

I guess after writing all of this, my main point is the kind of habits I have formed over two decades feel so irreversible. 
I have probably missed a lot out to inform you guys on but I hope you get the drift of my inner core at the minute. 

I want to change my life. I have always wanted to. I just don’t do it. I just don’t. And thinking positive being positive only lasts so long before I am back being so deep and negative inside.",26Feb2020,1

145,"So there is a dream I have. I want to be a doctor. And in my country there is this test which is very   competitive which you need to clear to get into a medical college. A little bit about me first. I have grown up in a city environment and my school was not very competitive. I was rather good at school. I got a 95 percent in my 10 grade and a 92 in my grade 12. However admission to medical college is not done via those examinations. There is a seperate exam. It was a month or so after my grade 12 exam. I cleared the cutoff however didn't get a college (that's because the acceptance ratio is very low because of the huge amount of students who sit for the exam and thus just clearing the cutoff is not enough to get a good college. You need a pretty high rank) I didn't perform very well there. So I decided to take a drop year. I was very motivated in the beginning and was getting good marks in the exams conducted by my coaching class. But recently (maybe a month or so) I am not able to study. I feel low. Burnout. Idk. I practically stopped studying. I just listen to music and lie down. Use my laptop from time to time. Try to study but I just fucking can't. Idk what happened. I was never pressurized by my parents or friends or school but there was a part of me that always thought I could get what I want. Since my school was not very competitive and thus I never saw how tough it actually was. I have pressurized myself. And this pressure is killing me. I have about 3 months for my second chance and I feel like I can't do it. There are students out there studying for 2-3 years for this and what I am doing. Procrastinating. Being lazy. Idk. Everything was so good in the beginning of this academic session and now I feel like this is the lowest point in my life. 
I have many great friends but society has made me believe that when you use social media and hangout and waste time you wount be able to crazk this exam and this I quit social media. I lost touch with all my friends. I do get calls from a few of them who are worried what happened to me. But now I don't even want to talk to them. I feel like a failure. I could have gone to an engineering college where I got admission but I convinced my parents to let me take a drop and study to become a doctor. But I feel that was the biggest mistake of the life. I should have settled with what I was getting. Most of them went off to collleges and at having a pretty good time while I am sitting in my room studying the same shit I studied in grade 11 and 12. 
After all this. After I took a drop. After all the pressure I put on myself. After all this expectations ppl had from me. I feel I will disappoint everyone around me. Myself included. And get into an engineering college after all. I feel like i have forgotten everything I have studied and with just about 2 months left idk what the fuck I will do. 
I don't even know what I wrote and if it made any sense. But I needed this. I don't want to talk to my mother about this because I know she will be very worried about me and I don't want that. Sorry for the long rant. And thanks to Reddit for giving me a place to rant. Thanks.",26Feb2020,1

[https://youtu.be/GE4hQN9ECe8](https://youtu.be/GE4hQN9ECe8)

In this video we will look at the age-old subject, what is the meaning of life? Where can we find happiness? Is meditation the key?

I was inspired to make this video following a Ted Talks conversation.

After watching a TED TALK about a Mars Mission I then commented and this started a short conversation about happiness and what is a meaningful action and what is it we can do to find meaning in our life.

If there were such things as Aliens, would they have the answer to our question: How Can We Be Happy? Maybe we already have the answer….

149,"Due to my financial constraints I cannot afford to see a therapist, however, I have been encouraged to do some visiting of my child self to do work on trauma from when I was young. 

To give some context, my father was a severe alcoholic (though never abusive) and my mum would often go away for work and I would take care of my younger brother. I would be 4-8 years old and my brother would be 1-4 years old around that time. Our father's work had us move around a lot and I don't think we lived in a house for longer than a couple years. I lacked a lot of stability and vividly remember making and selling items as a child, as my parents often borrowed my little savings for food, gas, etc. My dad is now sober but we still have a strained relationship. My mum and I are very close.

When I was approximately 4 years old, I had a near death experience. I grounded the stove and fridge together and had 220-v travel through my heart. My then pregnant mum managed to disconnect me from the current but she and my brother, were also electrocuted. I am realizing I still carry guilt over that and never really confronted it, over 20+ years later. 

Since this NDE, I have developed an intense fear of suddenly dying. It could be that we accidentally under cook food and there's a pathogen, that I would be diagnosed with a rare condition etc. I am aware that it is extremely unlikely but this thought pattern has totally disabled my logic and often ends in panic attacks. When I was 11, I had a friend that was suddenly diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia and died less than a week after her diagnosis. I remember hearing about her death really made my confront my own morality and experienced my first panic attack. 

By a recommendation of a few different mental health professionals, I have been encouraged to revisit my child during some of these traumatic events and offer a support role. To give myself love, stability and support when I felt I never had it as a child. But whenever I try to do this ""journey"" I am completely inconsolable and often am crying within minutes. I don't know if this is healthy or a part of my processing? Any thoughts are appreciated.

155,"Ill start by saying first. I'm depressed, Not suicidal

I can't continue to be the only person caring (physically and emotionally) for my mother who was diagnosed with breast cancer nearly 3 years ago.

I live at home with mother and father. I have an older sibling less that 20 minutes away in the next town over. dad expects everything to be done when he gets home from work and is the sole monetary provider outside of mom's meager disability checks. I'm responsible for getting meals made and making sure his coffee pot is ready for him in the morning, cleaning up around the house, doing dishes, taking care of the trash and getting it out to the curb Sunday evening for pickup. Dad comes home at 4:30-5 pm during the week and sits home all weekend  in his own world not doing anything meaningful or productive. Sibling is Understandably busy with a house of her own, a husband, and two young girls (2 years old) and the newest (around 5 months old) three. In her off time they go out and have ""grammie  and grampie"" babysit so they can have date nights on weekends a couple times a month. 

We love those girls to pieces and would do anything for them in the blink of an eye, But they are a lot more work and so physically demanding. mom doesn't have the strength to keep up with the older girl .

I do my best to help out around the house but its getting increasingly disorganized. I just don't KNOW what to do with stuff that comes in the mail, and my father refuses to be productive and help sort through anything that doesn't have his name on it, or doesn't interest him.

Back to sister for a moment. I reached out to her over the weekend to see if she would stop over here for a couple hours so Grammie could love on her girls and was ghosted until I sent her another message today. I Sarcastically thanked her for showing concern for the woman who brought us both into the world, and for ignoring me all weekend to which I got a rude response to the effect of, ""Now you know how it feels"". 

Okay I would say I understand that since I am notoriously slow to reply to anyone. But I don't reply late/slow because I want to be an asshole. Im busy making sure meds are being taken on time, food happens, dishes are clean and figuring out how the hell We can have a dinner made by 6:30 pm when there is not a single ingredient in the house to cook with.

We don't have a family history of mental illness But I personally have had a history with it. it isn't news to anyone in the family that I struggled for a long time from a young age( 6-7) to my early twenties. I never sought help in any form, Professional or other. Father had gotten therapy some years back to try and find the root of his nicotine addiction which really never panned out as he was resisting any and all advise. Mom had a few sessions not long after diagnosis, and Now Im hearing that Sister goes regularly. the single most mentally stable person in the family gets to take advantage of these sessions  while the one who would benefit the most by talking through issues,,, sits and rots in self pity and loathing with an easy to see hatred towards the world in general for what feels like no reason.

I sit here desperate for the kind of help she has in the past gloated about having at her disposal. I despise the system in place that hands out help to those who are in good positions emotionally and financially so seek this guidance privately, While the ones in real need are pushed aside and only taken notice of when they end up in the news for dealing with their torment in destructive ways that benefits no one.

156,"Background: I work at a small auto shop assisting other technicians. I've been here for about 4 months, going on 5. There's one technician who's always been a bit off but I don't intentionally try to bother him.

It seems that, whenever he asks me to do something (test drive, perform a certain service, etc) he usually says it towards me with hostility. It's been like this since day 1, and even on day 1 he mentioned ""I don't remember people's names till maybe a year, if you're around that long.""

It only kept getting worse really from there. I try to avoid him as much as I can because the guy makes me uneasy and fearful. Earlier today I was heading out to grab lunch and we almost hit each other, him from a test drive and me leaving the lot. Our lot isn't that big and MAYBE 2 cars can fit easily.

Regardless, I stop and he drives by. I think nothing of it and go about my business. I come back and clock in, and, in front of one of the managers he spouts ""If you almost hit me again, I'm going to murder you.""

160,"I'm 19 almost 20. I don't identify as a 'teenager' anymore and don't relate with younger teens either.

A lot of people associate depression, anxiety and avoiding people with the teenage years. A lot of teens do grow out of their depressed, socially anxious phase. That is not to say those problems aren't real and harmful, but many teens' mental health gets better by the time they're twenty-five. I know this through research and the experiences of those around me.

But me? I'm not going to change. I know the mentally unhealthy aspects of myself will not change much throughout the years. Because I have tried everything I can to change myself but failed. And I feel so so isolated. I can spot the socially anxious teen from a mile away, I've sadly seen self-harm scars on teenagers. But I've never seen those characteristics in someone over 20. 

I know about 3 very unwell people in my neighborhood, two with what looks to be schizophrenia, and one with possible chronic depression. Point is, you can spot that they are mentally unwell from a mile away.

But I've never seen anyone like me. I'm very socially anxious. I try as much as possible not to engage with people. I'm extremely annoyed by people and especially the culture of stranger chit-chat that we have. I don't make eye-contact with anyone. I just try to avoid people as much as possible. I'm sure people think I'm either rude or simple-minded.

167,"I need to fake enthusiasm for college/job applications.

I like teenagers and I absolutely *need* adequate yearly time off, so I’m going to be a high school teacher. 

The only thing I actually want to do is be a freelance novel writer and part time sub teacher, but until I sell a book ofc I need a full time job.

I’m convinced being a hs teacher is the best possible full time job for me, but the problem is that I really, really don’t want any full time job.

I’m bad at faking enthusiasm, so does anyone have any suggestions? I’d also appreciate help brainstorming socially acceptable reasons to become a teacher, because maybe one of you can help me find a reason I could *actually* be enthusiastic about other than “I want to be a teacher so that I’d get summers off.”

(The reason I like subbing is that I get to meet new students and teach a new class every day, which doesn’t apply to a full time position.)",26Feb2020,1
168,"Ok so, a smidge of background info in case it’s necessary. I’m currently 15, a boy, and go to a pretty good high-school. I have friends, my grades are normal, live in a stable household with nice parents, and everything’s overall pretty average.
The only issue is, whenever I do anything bad, intentional or not, it just REALLY fucks me up.
I dunno whether I’m a dumbass and this is normal or what, but whenever I get in trouble, especially by adults, I freak the fuck out.

On the outside, I just act calm and collected, all the usual stuff: apologise, go back to business. But on the inside I feel like the lowest piece of shit there is, sometimes I even start shaking from panic, but usually just when I’m alone.

For example, this one time on the schoolbus, my friends gave me a bottle of water and told me to squeeze it as hard as possible. Long story short it travelled all the way to the front of the bus and got the window wet.
The driver stopped and asked who did it. I froze for like, 5 minutes until everyone started telling me to get my ass up and deal with the consequences, which I did. He was actually really chill about it, saying “I won’t get mad this time, just don’t do that again or there’ll be consequences” in a really calm way. BUT when I got home, I was a wreck. Shuddering like it was sub-zero, not being able to sleep until hours after my usual schedule, really pathetic looking back on it, and I was around 13-14 at the time, hardly a little kid.

I always just reckoned everyone was like this, but now I’m not so sure. A lot of the other boys in my class get into trouble a lot, and they’re somehow able to just casually shrug everything off right after getting a yelling and never think about it again, which to me is bloody insane to observe.
I dunno, there’s a good chance this is normal and if it is then I’m sorry for posting a non-issue on this subreddit, but it’s just getting really horrid to have to deal with. Cheers.",26Feb2020,1

I started using CBD and it has done a little to curb my paranoia but not a lot. Everywhere I go I feel like people are watching me for a specific reason, when I know people are actually staring at me usually wondering why I look so tired and stressed. I don’t think I would go as far to kill myself but I am torn between not wanting to be alive anymore and being afraid to die all the time, especially when I have these feelings that someone is going to end my life for me.

 I’m not far behind!!) .. does this mean I have to stay for an hour and not 30 minutes which I was told it would take? Does this mean I have to go every Thursday after school for an hour? I don’t wanna have to be at school for an extra hour.. it’s hard enough getting myself out of bed on a morning and as soon as school is over I’m out those doors and going home to “relax”.

I had a female allergist tell me my allergic reaction to animals was in my head. There were more but I don't feel like listing them all.

175,"My university has an on call counselor with a phone number labled crisis “hotline.” The first time I called, they said there were no counselors b/c they were all on lunch break. When I called back, they said I had to come to the crisis center, in person. They do not council over the phone.

First of all, I have class in 20 minutes so no time to go to the center. I am in a crisis but missing my class won’t make things any better. I assume that their reasoning is that “if they are really in a crisis they will stop everything and come over.” But surprise, I am the instructor. It is my class that I am teaching. I can’t just not go...I have to pay rent. I can’t avoid suicide but end up evicted. 

Second of all, I’m not stupid. If I show up, in person, they could easily hospitalize me or send me to an emergency room.

Friend number 1 told me late last night she's going through a lot of stuff, she really needs to talk to someone about it, but she doesn't trust anyone. We're best friends and she normally tells me everything but she said she can't tell me. She just can't bring herself. She doesn't want me to help her because she feels like she's using me, and she thinks she can get through it on her own, but I can see she's really struggling and it destroys me to see. I see her walking off in school all the time because she just wants to be alone or somethings gotten to her or somethings on her mind and I just want to chase after her and hug her and let her know everything going to be okay and she can work through this but she tells me not to follow her, if she wants me to come with her she'll tell me.  

Friend number 2, told me this morning that she lost her best friend last month to suicide. She said I'm the 3rd person besides family that she's told, she was the first person there, and went in to depth about it and I just wanted to cry. I just couldn't imagine what it would be like for anyone to go through something as horrible as that. And so obviously she's been struggling so so much over the last month and I had no idea and I feel awful that I've not been there more, and that I've just been a spectator on the sideline.   

Friend number 3. This came just after friend number 2 told me the whole dead with her best friend simply because she thought the same had happened to Friend 3 two nights ago. He's been going through alot, he's been pushing people away and whenever me and his friends have tried to talk with him, he clams up, and pushes you away further so it's hard to understand really what's going on. Anyway at the weekend he told her that he just wanted it to all go away and he wanted the pain to end and he felt the only way that was going to happen was if he was to just go to sleep and never wake up. Then he didn't respond to her for half and hour and she was fucking terrified, but he said he was just with friends and he was drinking and taking pills and he's on antis as it is so he's just doing more damage. She showed me their chat which lasted for hours and she sort of talked him down from the whole going to sleep and not waking up thing but again the same as the other two, I just feel so helpless.

181,"So, I've been in this whole rut for months now and it's getting to the point where I feel myself about to break...

I graduated college in May of 2019 and moved into my boyfriends parents house with him. We figured this would be our best options due to me having so much debt (50k$)and we hadn't found jobs yet. Well, I have a job now but I get paid 9.65 an hour and I get roughly 1,000-1,200$ a month. I'm determined to pay my loans off sooner and so my payments are around 400$ monthly but I pay more each month to speed the process up a bit, so around 700-800$. That leaves me with a few hundred left for the entire month and I have other small bills to pay for. Basically, I'm left with around 100$ in spare money. I'm in the process of looking for better work but I live around 45-60mins away from anything within my field and the kicker? I don't have a car because I can't afford one. I'm about to get my license but what's that good for if I can't afford a car?
I'm getting annoyed with my boyfriends parent. His mom works and his dad doesn't. So on my off days, I'm stuck at home (which is fine cause laundry and other stuff need to be done) with his dad and no privacy. I want to blare music, walk around in my underwear and be weird but he's like in his 60s and sits around. His mom is getting on my nerves how she seems to do things that she knows I do not like. I'm trying to use products that can be used over and over again like tubberware and containers for beans/grains. She's a ""germaphobe"" and always puts leftovers in plastic bags which she knows I hate. She rarely hand washed dishes anyways, so why does it matter if leftovers in reusable containers get gross, you ain't washing them?
Our ideals are also very different. But I won't get into that. Too much political crap that I literally can't do anything about.


So basically, all of this is causing my mental health to deteriorate. I don't zero independence. My job is terrible. My housing is crappy (I am grateful to have a roof over my head though). My location sucks - middle of bumfuck nowhere. My finances suck. Just everything sucks right now. I want to move so badly but my boyfriend and I can't afford it right now.

183,"So ive been struggling w depression and self esteem lately. I happened to be online tooling around and i took the “lifetrap test” on IDr Labs based off of the book Reinventing Your Life. I feel like i’ve been read but i don’t know what to do w the info and why i feel this way... this is what it said: 

“Defectiveness Lifetrap
The emotion most recurring in you is shame. Shame is what you feel when your defects are exposed. You will do almost anything to avoid this shame. Consequently you go to great lengths to keep your defectiveness hidden. You feel that your defectiveness is inside you and not immediately observable. You feel like you have to pretend to be someone you are not to be accepted. You hide your true self to fit in, but that also means that many people in your life will never know the real you.
At your core you feel completely unworthy of love. It is possible that you struggle with feelings of depression – a kind of low-level depression always lurking in the background. You may be drawn to partners who are critical of you and put you down. They generate high chemistry, but reinforce your feelings of defectiveness.
It is likely that you spend a lot of time comparing yourself unfavorably to others and feel inadequate as a result. You feel like an impostor when you are successful. You are anxious that you cannot maintain your success. Your sense of well-being is fragile, and even small setbacks or failures may be enough to make you nervous and stressed. To feel humiliated and inadequate, as if the whole world is about to catch sight of your defectiveness.”

This hit the nail on the head but my problem was this. . More articles also went on to say these “lifetraps” were all based off of childhood wounds. It says parents were too critical and possibly abusive and made me feel unlovable. This feels very wrong to me. I actually had a great childhood. I never struggled with these feelings until late adolescence. 

My freshman year of college (TW)
I was sexually violated in my own room by a “friend” who broke in drunk. This was before i had even had sex. It wasn’t rape, so i am in no way comparing myself to rape victims, but i kind of was fucked from that. I confided in a best friend (let’s call her O) and she basically told me I was being a prude and should have “laughed it off” or “had fun with it.”
Along with that, she constantly made fun of me for my really bad fear of intimacy, being really underweight from being prescribed anxiety meds, and my face. She would literally tell me not to get in pictures with her, and told my best friend (let’s cal her B) that I was so ugly even the best plastic surgery procedures couldn’t fix me. She also said my anxiety was the reason I was so “weird” and wouldn’t have sex.
I finally cut her off and she made me feel so awful about it. She said okay she talked shit but B and everyone says worse about me and no one really liked me.
Next year (sophomore year) I had sex, meaning I lost my virginity rather late the week before I turned 19. It was rather bad and painful and I noticed it was abnormal and he didn’t finish. I brushed it off but we’ll come back to this. Anyway the stuff with O really fucked me up and I spiraled into depression, a completely new diagnosis. I barely ate but the meds made me gain 20lbs. I absolutely hated myself and the weight made me feel worse. I really hit rock bottom. My grades plummeted. 
I worked my way back up with the help of some new clubs and actually genuine friends. I was ready for emotional and physical intimacy. It all seemed great. But then again I had a new sexual partner and couldn’t perform again. This worsened my self loathing and I avoided dating and sex altogether.
I got checked out at a gyno (at 21. LATE) and she diagnosed me with nerve pain. Chronic. i basically have to go to PT if I ever want a normal sex life.
(TW)
I felt so awful about it and myself, and I self harmed once this year which i’m ashamed of.
I had a bad depressive episode around Jan-Feb 2020 and it’s better ish now but I just feel trapped. When it’s good im fine but when it’s bad it’s real bad.

186,"- This friendly reminder and advice, is especially for whom can relate to this in one way or another. Otherwise this is just a personal way of thinking on going about thoughts, emotions and such.

I was once angry at everything and everyone.
I once portrayed an image of most often not giving a fuck.
I was once that person that always found a reason to put the blame onto someone else, 
when I didn’t want to own up to that ownership when I should have, despite whatever reason.

I once lived in numbness, 
nothingness,
which was due to how I chose to suppress and/or self medicate my feelings associated with stress or traumas.
With pills, alcohol and marijuana.
Choosing not to talk about my issues, problems, causes of pain.

I felt of sense of weakness that I did not like, if I did choose to talk of these things and/or feel those hurtful emotions.
I didn’t want to tell people that stuff anymore,
because I got too attached.
In some cases I got hurt real bad from those attachments,
from people that knew my deep problems and such.
They either left me or turned my issues against me.

Which led to those feelings of numbness and such,
as time went on. 
I didn’t feel as I could trust anyone.
In fear of getting hurt or left again.
That’s what led to that dependence of substances.

I want to remind you...
That this pain and way of life, you cannot ignore it forever.
You don’t have to live this way.
I couldn’t. 
As I endured overdoses and hospitalizations from suicidal thoughts from the roots of my pains.
It’s not weakness to cry, have feelings of sadness, and/or have regrets.

I want to suggest that you try to,
take a lot of personal time.
Get rid of unnecessary distractions such as,
social media, 
or whatever you usually distract yourself with, 
that prohibits this personal time.

It would be of great help to take this time in sobriety.
substances can impair and influence how some may think.

During this time, 
I want you to start by ask yourself,
“Am I happy living this way?”

Then take the needed and necessary amount of time to reflect on that question to answer it.

You may start to understand the who’s, why’s, how’s, when’s, where’s and what’s.
In a way to understand why you are who you are now, or were at a past time.

You can start to understand what parts of your environment, whilst growing up, has influenced you to be who you are now.
Don’t try and justify or excuse yourself because of this.
Rather to just simply see an understanding of what factors have played a development into yourself.

Those regrets, you do not have to hate yourself for them.
Allow yourself to hurt from those regrets.
Allow these negative feelings to be there. Let them sit.
In which you can allow yourself to heal in a healthy way.

If it gets bad enough to where you have suicidal thoughts and/or self harm or to harm others... 
Please seek immediate help in that case.
You will be okay in the long run.

Then know you can choose to look at these regrets with a way of, 
how you can be learning and growing from them.
If you already have done this, 
then give yourself a reminder of pride or being proud of who you are and how’ve you positively grown from these things.

I do this, as I am so proud of who I am now.
When I could’ve found or used every excuse to have been such a worse person.

I’m not actually not lazy because there’s lots of things I do own my own which require lots of time like reading philosophy or writing music, but I just cannot have long term goals in life. What could be the problem? (I’ve struggled with anxiety in the past)",26Feb2020,1
191,"In 2014 I was a sophomore at a large state school. At the beginning of the fall semester, I had a full-on mental break down. I was severely depressed, could barely get out of bed, and essentially stopped going to class. The worst part about this was I was really good at hiding it and was in complete denial. There were circumstances in my home life that contributed to the issue and essentially I didn’t see taking a leave of absence or withdrawing as an option because that would mean moving back in with my family, which I think would have made things worse.

No one really noticed and I didn’t tell anyone. My parents called me to tell me they would not pay for school anymore because of my grades (I failed all my courses after having a 3.6 the previous semester), but they never asked me if something was wrong or if I was ok. At the time, I felt defensive and angry with them for only caring about money so I said that I would take out loans by myself—a totally stupid decision that I now regret immensely (again I was mentally ill). They let me do it and I never heard a word about school again from them after that. My mental health continued to decline and this went on for two more semesters until finally, the university told me they would kick me out if I had another bad semester.

Only then when presented with an ultimatum did I leave. After hitting rock bottom, I finally got help and started seeing a therapist and they honestly saved my life. I started working and got my own apartment and took classes at community college. After three years of rebuilding myself and healing, finally getting a diagnosis and getting myself medicated, I felt ready to reenroll at my university. This past fall was my first full-time semester back and I finished it with a 4.0. I am on track for the same thing this semester.

My issue is this—because of those previous semesters, my GPA was a 1.4 when I came back. At this point, even if I get 4.0s for six more semesters, the best I’ll have is around a 3.0 and while that’s not necessarily a terrible GPA, it’s just not a reflection of my academic performance.

When I am healthy, I am highly ambitious and being ineligible for honors programs and scholarships for academic achievement feels incredibly unfair. I absolutely plan to apply for law school or grad school. If I were planning to work straight after graduation, then I would accept the idea that “my GPA doesn’t matter”. My GPA as it is reflects the fact that I had an undiagnosed mental illness and little to no support system. The university policy allows for you to appeal for one semester. When I asked why I could not appeal all three, they said: “if we let everyone do that it wouldn’t be fair.” I’m having a hard time accepting that my situation could ever apply to “everyone”. This feels incredibly unfair and like am being punished for having a mental illness.

Am I wrong for feeling like this is unfair? I don’t want to come off as entitled, but the point of a GPA is to reflect academic performance and the point of honors programs and scholarships is to reward high achieving students for their hard work—not to mention applicant pools are highly competitive and anything that shows what kind of student you are, helps.

I’ve been really discouraged by this and it’s affecting my motivation. If anyone has experience with a similar situation, or suggestions of ways to manage something like this I would be very grateful.

Thank you in advance, this is a long one so if you read this far I appreciate you!",26Feb2020,1

193,"Personally, I cringe when I hear this word. Toxic should be used to refer to a poison, a ‘toxin’ that poses a threat or danger. It was a word used seldom unless the situation was dire. When someone warned you that something was toxic you took their warning seriously. Now we use it casually to refer to both food and people as if they were the same.

There’s no definition of a toxic person. It is not a psychological diagnosis. There are no physical indicators of a person being toxic. One cannot visit their doctor and submit to tests to determine if they are indeed a toxic person, nor can they seek a cure. In a culture that is evolving and becoming more sensitive to labels applied with regard to race, gender, and sexuality it seems we’ve simply created new methods of labeling people through our use of the term toxic. People who engage in behavior which we do not approve of, people who we feel have slighted us in some fashion, people we feel are overly negative we label as toxic and quickly take steps to cut them from our lives.

We talk about how smart we are, how much healthier a person we are because we have taken the difficult step of pushing a toxic person from our lives. There’s an air of superiority, a belief of righteousness we imagine attached to us when we choose to label another human as toxic. We feel justified. We made a conscious decision to label someone as broken and dangerous. We label the person as a hazard that should be avoided. We choose to pull away from these people after we label them, and in the end we shun them, we feel like we are being positive often at the same time that we praise ourselves for eliminating toxic relationships from our lives.

Self-help books, and online gurus encourage us to dismiss the parts of our life that bring us down. We’re encouraged to be strong and not allow ourselves to be abused by anyone. That’s solid advice. However, the solution all too often is to apply a label of toxicity to the elements in our life that are letting us down, be they vegetable, mineral...or human.

There are no toxic people in the world. There are definitely some assholes in the world, a number of douchebags, and definitely some individuals with very negative behaviors. You might even argue that the behaviors of these assholes and douchebags are toxic, meaning they are potentially harmful to you or to your relationship with that person. Labeling a BEHAVIOR as toxic and dangerous is not the same thing as labeling a PERSON as such.

We know that human behavior is born from many elements, and that our external environment and experiences plays an important role in the person we become. Many behaviors deemed toxic are the result of learned patterns and behavior due to negative experiences or trauma. It doesn’t excuse the behavior, and an individual shouldn’t be forced to put up with it in a relationship simply because someone has experienced trauma. However, what labeling people as toxic does is it allows us to not have to take any responsibility for our relationships. We give up our right to express empathy. When we label someone as toxic we are essentially saying that the other person bears the sole responsibility for what went wrong ; we’re publicly saying that none of the fault lies with us. The term toxic becomes an easy label to hide behind and it perpetuates the idea of an ongoing victim mentality.",26Feb2020,1

195,"Hi, im an almost 18 years old male. Since i can remember i had trouble waking up to go to school or to do any other productive activities. I've been skipping school only to lay in bed all day regretting it like crazy, skipping important exams to which i studied for the night before, overall literally disappointing everyone around me that care.
The thing is, i get literally no support from any of my friends or family, I've tried explaining but the usual answers are ""go to sleep earlier"" or ""just get up it's not that hard"". I don't blame them, most of them just think im lazy and i dont care about good grades or school overall and I don't blame you if you think the same. The routine is, i usually wake up, my bell ringing, but i cant seem to get up. I'm like a totally different person in the morning that has no motivation and self control. I've tried it all, putting my phone away from my reach, asking my family to get me out of bed, but none of that seems to be working.
I'm on the brink of just accepting the fact that I'm just a lazy disappointment and will end up letting down everyone that expects anything from me. My parents have literally no things left to take away from me because it's obvious for them that the reason I'm not going to school is that I stay up too late, and trust me, I tried going to sleep at a lot different times of the day and the more I sleep the harder it gets to wake up. I'm searching for help here, im too ashamed to talk about it to anyone because I've never been taken seriously. Has anyone had any similar issues and knows how to resolve them or at least make it any better? Thank you",26Feb2020,1
196,"This is my first post using reddit and this is something very personal, but I felt like I had to share what’s going on with me because I feel like I’m going crazy or schizophrenic, and I’m hoping in anyway if you could help me out or have had something similar. I’ve been seeing numbers for about the past 3 years of my life. It would come and go. I would see the numbers 333, 420, 666, and 911. I kept seeing this number on the clocks, license plates, etc. I used to shrug them off thinking it’s just coincidental. I would see each number for a course about 3 months and then it would change. But NOW I’m seeing the number 69 everywhere... and this is not a joke, because I’m suffering from it. I first starting seeing it back in the beginning of January last year (2019). In March I went with my friend to Rosarito, Mexico for the weekend and I kept seeing that number again everywhere. On my phone percentage, the price of an item on the television, everywhere. I got curious the first night we got to our AirBnb and I Googled, “Why do I keep seeing 69?” It told me that the number 69 was telling me to be close to my family because something drastic was going to change the whole course of my life to where I’ll need to spend more time with them. It also told me that when you see it, it’s because something is affecting you in a negative way. I shrugged it off like I kinda usually did hoping I wasn’t crazy. When I came home I saw my Dad had a black eye. I asked him if he had gotten hit, but he said they just started to appear on his body. We found out it was Leukemia. My dad went to the Vietnam War so he contracted the Agent Orange Chemical they used (he’s 71). I was speechless and felt sick to my stomach when my Dad told me. I lost it mentally after a few months. There was a dark moment last year where I kept doing LSD. I did it once the first time and 3 months later I did it about 3-4 times in a week. And then once or twice a month for 2 months. I had a strong feeling that LSD had messed up my brain, but the thing that drives me crazy is that I feel like LSD had nothing to do with it because when I was with my friends and family members I would see the number 69 when I’d be with them, and they’d see it too when I’d point it out. And what’s worse is that it happens coincidentally before we even see it. We’ll be talking about it and it turns out to be my 69 phone percentage or the back of a license plate number. At one point my cousin told me to stop talking about it because it was getting him scared and uncomfortable. It always happens coincidentally or when I’m thinking about something negative or I feel like I’m doing something negative (like not going to work for a day because I feel lazy or sluggishly tired). I see it everywhere. When I’m driving in my car and the last 2 numbers of the license plate in front of me are 69. I see it when I’m at a restaurant and I stare at the screen and see the score of a sports game go from 69 to 70  right when I stare at the screen for the first time. I see it when I’m playing a video game and my score is 69. When I’m on Instagram and there’s a post with 69 likes or 69 comments. When something is being advertised and the price is 69.99 (this one doesn’t get me much but it’s still there and bothers me because of all this). 

Today my dad is still battling for his life. The Leukemia has gone away, but now he’s fighting for his life because he’s to weak from everything. He can’t swallow, his body isn’t making any blood, he can’t go to the bathroom, and I feel like I’m losing him everyday. And what’s worse is that he’s 45 minutes away from our house and I drive back and forth reflecting on everything that I feel is going wrong and how much I miss him because he’s been gone for 2 1/2 months now in the hospital. And almost every time I drive to see him I coincidentally see the number 69 on a license plate of a car that cuts me off on the free way almost making me crash. He’s on a oxygen machine with a tube in his mouth. And all I see is this stupid F****** number driving me insane to the brink of me killing myself if he doesn’t make it. I feel like I’m letting go of reality. 

If there’s anybody out there experiencing the same thing I am or has an explanation please help me I beg you. I don’t know how much more I can take of this...",26Feb2020,1

Maybe I'm just being dramatic. I probably am.

I kept my struggle with my sexuality to myself because nobody wants to hear about it, even the queer kids hate people like us.

202,"Am I a pathological liar?

First of all I don’t know how long this is going to be but I can imagine it’s gonna be a long one.
I’ve been with my girlfriend for near enough two years, I love her so so much and I would do anything for her, I seen her a long time before I actually first messaged her because I was so scared of her not liking me, so when we first started talking I put on a front of a typical boy (sex obsessed etc) when in reality that is the complete opposite of what I am, I just thought that’s what you needed to be to get somebody to like you, I resent myself for this and I know that it was not the correct thing to do and lying is never ever right.

Since then we have been told each other everything about each other, like, really really personal shit that we’ve never told anyone, she has known me and loved me for about a year now, and things have been great, she has the occasional slip up of doubt which is completely okay because I know it’s my fault, in this time she has cheated on me twice but I have understood her reasons and forgiven her, she is the most amazing person on the planet and while I know what I’ve just written seems bad it makes sense.

I would like to clarify I have not cheated in any way and that is not what I’m suggesting, but for instance I have told her I haven’t liked a girls picture from a year or so before we got together and then it turned out I had, I also used to say I watched porn and masturbated when in reality I have never actually “watched” porn (nudity/sex) and I look away whenever there is nudity on my tv screen etc. I don’t know what I can do because I haven’t been following any girls on Instagram/twitter/snapchat for a while now and although I did this for my own reasons I don’t know how else I can ease her doubts. 

Right now we’re arguing because she went on my Instagram and seen that apparently I’ve voted on girls Instagram polls back in 2018, I have no memory of this and I’m certain that my votes have been bought because some of the accounts are in massive blocks in the same minute and also at time when I knew I’d been asleep. This has resulted in her calling me a freak and telling me that I need therapy because I’m a pathological liar, I really don’t want to lose her but obviously I’m too fucked up to be what she deserves, everything I do just hurts her and I feel like such a failure.

I don’t know what to do. Help.

I also have very low self esteem, revolving around feeling inadequate and incompetent. 

I'm a recent university graduate and am beginning my journey into the professional workforce, only I can't stomach doing work outside of my comfort zone as I am immediately overcome with anxiety and feel incapable of doing even the simplest things.

Living here for the past two years has changed me so much I honestly feel like a different person on some days, but others I remember how I used to behave or I remember something from my past and can have a variety of adverse reactions because of it. I don’t have goals (besides passing high school) or I am overly ambitious and take on more then I can chew. Since softmore year started, everything is either extremely up, down, or numb. I have so many things to get off of my chest, and I try to with my family, but I either am told, “ You’re just being overdramatic! Everyone has those thoughts. Quit worrying so much about your emotions!” Or they try to “give advice” on how to fix what I am feeling. It can make me shut down or isolate myself, and I have trouble having any motivation to do anything but stay on my YouTube, stare at the ceiling, stuff my face, or sleep. I have thought about suicide and have gotten really close to doing so but I remember everyone is hurt and just can’t. I’m stuck in a limbo of hating myself to making myself purposely/unintentionally forget my pain I carry to get on with it. I’ve asked about the topic of therapy this past summer and immediately got told “ They just want money and to stuff pills down your throat. Just get on with life like everyone else. You don’t need it.” I’m scared to explain my reasons and feelings cause I feel I’m just gonna be ignored or it’ll come out wrong as per usual. I know they care and see I’m in pain, but they view it as me torturing myself because I want to. How do I tell them I just want someone to talk to about this and how to better cope with my mixed feelings?",26Feb2020,1
222,"First post here, so I'm sorry if I break any of the rules. I'm trying my best to read and follow them.  

I'm a U.S.-based first-year grad student who was admitted to my first-choice program.  I've only been here a couple of months, but each day I feel my sense of belonging and community diminishing into nothing.  This has had a horrible effect on my mental health, as I feel like no one loves me, I'm not supported, and that everyone around me would be better off without me.  

I worked so hard to be admitted to this program, and I can't tell if I'm truly unhappy or just adjusting.  I feel like I never say the right things, or get the right information from my class's readings, or that anybody likes me.  I want nothing more to feel loved and supported.

The breaking point was today in class, when I tried to make a lighthearted comment which was misheard, and construed by some as inappropriate until they realized what I had actually said.  I'm not sure if the professor heard the correction, and on my walk home I felt more horrible and isolated, to the point where I figured I was a horrible embarrassment who was admitted by mistake.  

These feelings are the culmination of many months of criticism and isolation, where I feel like the nature of my personality simply does not fit with academia.  I've never been more critical of my personality than I am at the moment, and my self-confidence is shattered.  I just want to love myself again, but I feel like ""myself"" is shameful, embarrassing, and unwanted.  

Has anyone been in a similar situation, and finally adjusted once they found a community?  I am currently in therapy (meeting every 2 weeks) but I don't know how to talk to my therapist about these feelings without being hospitalized for suicide ideation.  I've been in adjustment periods before, but this one feels so much worse since the light at the end of the tunnel is 5+ years away, only to be thrust into more academia.  Does anyone have any ways to reassure myself?  I'm open to any help.",26Feb2020,1
223,"I finally plucked up the courage, after 8 long months of silently suffering every day, to tell my mum that I need to speak to someone about my mental health and that I think I’m depressed. She’s making me an appointment tomorrow so...step one complete :)",26Feb2020,1
224,I am 19 now but when I was younger I didn’t get conversation at all. I would say random things that didn’t relate to the conversation. Also a lot of the time my ‘mates’ would call me out for being weird and being spaced. I would just do a little laugh every time someone would say anything to me or about me. Now I know conversation but am still bad at it and say things that barely relate to the conversation and won’t keep it going. I only just recently (the past year or two) have realised this about me. Looking back at anything in my past I was strange and the people around me would make it pretty clear. But I wouldn’t know because I was clueless. What is wrong with me.,26Feb2020,1
225,I just need someone to talk to right now.. If you want to chat just private message me.,26Feb2020,1
226,"So my doc today recommended I seek a sex therapist because she thinks my sporadic erectile problems may be resolved by unwinding some insecurities and anxieties. 

My question is, how much improvement is there in seeking a sex therapist to relieve psychological problems and anxieties causing bedroom troubles? I just want to be able to maintain an erection on the regular and not have any more anxieties with partners that are holding me back",26Feb2020,1
