0,"So I’ve noticed this thing about me where if I’m in the middle of something and I’m so close (and I mean SO FUCKING CLOSE) to the end and get interrupted somehow I get really pissed and irritated. Like as a kid when I would watch a movie and my parents came in to talk to me when there was literally 10 minutes left I would yell at them. Or if I read a book and I’m 2 pages from the end but then someone decided to talk to me. It didn’t happen a lot but it happens occasionally and I’m wondering if there is a specific term for it. I wouldn’t classify myself as OCD because I don’t have any specific compulsions, these are just average things I do in my life like reading, watching movies, focusing on any task. It might be a weird form of wanting closure or focus or something idk, this is also why texting while driving is a problem for me cause if I start a text while at a red light and don’t finish it by the time the green comes I feel really frustrated.",20Feb2020,1
1,"This is no trick or scam. I'm not asking for money. All I'm getting out of this is experience and helping others. I'm an advocate for Mental Health and pursuing a career in Councelling and volunteering to do this. 

Who wants to discuss openly their mental health troubles with an unbiased person with a different perspective, that are stopping you from your goals and are open to try new things?

Experts say this only works if you are open to change (which can include things you may or may not be doing). You can't adjust the whole world but you can adjust yourself right?",20Feb2020,1
2,"I’m a 16M who’s not feeling the same anymore... my brother says I used to be so cocky and arrogant and he used to love arguing with me, but ever since I got a girlfriend he said I’ve been becoming so soft, I even notice how I don’t have any energy for anything and all I do is think about her...

I also have a major problem where I can’t stop telling lies for fun, that’s all I do, tell lies for fun and I can’t stop... I almost lost my girlfriend after I was caught in one of them lying about her... I’ve always lied but ever since I started dating her I’ve got worse and started lying even more... I love her and I really don’t wanna end things but I’m afraid she will... 

I don’t eat anymore despite being a hungry boy my whole life and all I do is think about her and how much stuff I regret... I get sick twisted fun out of making fun of people and roasting people in big groups of friends and I can’t stop no matter how much I’m asked... I started seeing ants on the wall but when I go closer or touch them they disappear, and smelling/ tasting stuff that I haven’t seen in ages. 

I don’t know what’s wrong with me but I hope some of you do",20Feb2020,1

4,"I am not happy, nor am I sad. I'm indifferent with pretty much everything I do and accomplish these days and it irritates me since I have no idea why I feel like this.
I have a wonderful, loving girlfriend who's awaiting our first child, a supporting family and friends, a high-status job with almost limitless opportunities, which makes me pretty much economically independent for the rest of my life but still, I'm indifferent with these things.  
Me and my girlfriend travel, eating out, go on small adventures and such, but when the initial excitement cools down, I just feel like I'm tired of the things, and just want to do something else, but I have no idea what or why.  
I don't even care anything about soon being a dad or that my girlfriend is having a baby in her belly. I don't feel anything at all about it.
A couple of weeks ago, I found out that one of my friends was in fact, not the person who he said he was. He has been lying to me for the last almost two years, but still I don't feel like I'm angry, surprised, disappointed or anything. I just feel empty of feelings, as if I don't have energy to care about it.  
Sometimes I feel like I only do the things that people around me expect me to do, like a robot, and not the things I want to do. The problem is that I have no idea what I really want to do.",20Feb2020,1
5,"Hello.

I don't really know why i'm writing this, I guess I just need to talk and maybe someone to explain why I am feeling what I'm feeling. In my day life I pretend to be okay, it's not just pretending though, I actually believe it. Sometime I fall on this song on YouTube and its like the gate of a dam has been opened. For some reason all my emotions spill out, my head feels like its about to explode, and I just cry and cry. There's almost nothing I don't understand normaly, but this is something I don't. I just don't know why this happens. When I listen to the song i'm powerless and all that comes into my mind is how alone I am, how much I hate myself, and so on. I know logically that I'm not though, there are people around me. I just don't know. I don't want this to happen. I feel like my entire existence is made of pain, it hurts so bad, I don't want to exist.

6,"After hearing about BPD online I noticed that it's symptoms closely aligned with my thoughts and actions. I have taken a few 5-minute quizzes online but I know of course that being told by one of those you have BPD hardly means anything. I would like to elaborate on why exactly it is I believe that I have BPD so that some of you can share your opinion.

I tend to become hopelessly attached to one person and I get very stressed out if they even hint that they may not be interested in speaking to me. I think it's important to note that I have NEVER developed any physical or romantic attraction to anyone, my relationships with them have been purely platonic and I've never wished that it were otherwise. But when I meet someone I think is cool, I'll idolize them and I'll convince themselves that they're perfect.

I have a terribly short temper. I also find myself feeling empty and just lying in bed for hours on end. I've never wanted to kill myself but I've felt for a long time that I don't want to be alive. If that makes any sense.

I really doubt that I have BPD, but if one of you good people think I may need to seek the opinion of a professional, then I of course will.",20Feb2020,1
7,"Hi, im 14 y.o girl, i was bullied in primary (for the us its like elementary to middle school), it was really difficult and i kind of disconnected. Fast forward many years and in secondary( high school for US folk) and i never had a stable good friendship, i have a boyfriend but its not the same. Lately i started getting a supportive voice in my head. Either repeating my name, asking if im okay, or 2 days ago it told me to calm down in my mother tongue. I used to be scared, but now i feel less lonely. I just don't want it to split off from me. I often lose touch with reality and faze out, i have also a side of me which some times persists for weeks of severe depression, self harm and suicidal thoughts, after i get better,  i dont connect with them memories or emotions i felt, its like i was someone else. Also, sometimes when i write my emotions or start to think slightly delusional-y, i fear someone will do something, if i write it down, i ended up ripped several diary entries out. My therapist says my mental state is bad, so guess thats a thing. I feel bad for my parents sometimes. Right now, im quite positive, might leave school and learn at home. Also, if i concentrate i can kind of spark the voice to come back.

I dont know, ask questions or state your thoughts/opinions.

8,"This past year has been crazy, I(28m) have been coping/battling with depression/anxiety for close to 5 years now. My mental health renders me tired, irritable and sometimes depending on vices and extreme methods of escapism. I was physically and mentally abused as a child. And I've slowly come to peace with that period of my life being a big cause of alot of what I would call my problems.  I had tried unhealthy methods of medicating myself (cannabis, alcohol, cocaine) which to no surprise caused a huge increase in my horrible moods. I also tried help through the NHS but they also just wanted to medicate me ( I was given zoloft, which was great for switching the feelings off but honestly made me feel like i had lost my true self) The turning point for me was a relationship with a girl 2 years ago which was essentially meeting a person who was me in female form with a few extras, the relationship was toxic to say the least. We took drugs together, we fought alot, we argued alot. And even one time while drunk I had been struck by a partner. Now for someone who grew up with constant day in and day out physical beatings from my father to feel it from an outside source it hit home that i was wasting my life away. Chasing relationships that my mental health couldn't (and shouldnt) be in. So I removed myself from everything, removed all temptation, cut alcohol to ""special occasions"" and ""celebrations"" only (barring a few relapses). I invested heavily in myself (audiobooks, self care, self improvement) I took a look at the problems in my life and tackled them bit by bit, day by day. Before I continue I am in no way claiming that I am anywhere near where I want to be, infact just christmas past I relapsed horribly, drank an entire bottle of whiskey and picked a fight with my father on christmas eve and was kicked out of my family home, but in terms of what the fight was about I think I needed to say what I said.. the alcohol just didnt help how I presented the argument.. but in comparison to a year ago I am almost a new man.. I guess what message I'm trying to convey is, yes.. you will have your off days, you will have days where you wake up and you just want to tell the world to F*** off and pull your sheets over your head. But take it all day by day. Find things you want to be better at, make peace with your past, take the good with you and get rid of the bad and change what you can. There are countless books, videos, and people out there who can make each day easier. Mental health in my country (Northern Ireland) has now gotten to the point where more people have died from suicide since the troubles (essentially a civil war) than were murdered during that period of time (30+ years) which is crazy because it's still just not talked about here. But I've gained a lot of self respect and confidence through learning by myself and grinding it out. 

The phrase ""a day at a time, a step at a time"" was coined to me by an elderly gentleman at my place of work, he (70+) lived his life for his family, caring for his sick mother and father and due to this never married, never had kids, never had a family of his own. So in every right he had his dark days, burying every member of his immediate family before the age of 50. But he said to me on a day I was struggling and couldn't hide it... "" you know what my favorite thing in the world is... waking up first thing in the morning and saying ""Happy days, I've got another day of being me, let's go see what the world has for me today... and that's it.. just take it one day at a time... one step at a time and things will get better.. and I promise you that young man"" 

So have your bad days,
Have your good days, 
But do it all for you,
And be true to how you feel,
Grow where you can, 
And learn where you can.
Keep moving forward,
Be strong,
Be kind,
Be loved,
Be whatever you need to be
One day at a time,
One step at a time.",20Feb2020,1
9,"so I've been depressed for a while, I was having thoughts of not wanting to live anymore at 8, and I'm 17 years old now. I do go to therapy and take meds but I'm not sure how much that helps. I also workout 1-2 times a week (since I found whenever I did a little each day or a few days a week I only ended up having motivation to workout 1-2 times a week so instead now I workout really hard on those days, i have noticeable muscle) which is probably a large contributor to why I haven't committed  suicide yet. Anyways, something that has been depressing me is the though of moving out and having to take care of myself, I don't think I can really do it. I've worked in the past, during that time was the closest I've come to suicide (i did overdose on pills) even though it was just 2 weeks cause normally I do constantly distract myself and I had nothing to distract myself with at work. How do other depressed people do it, like function in life and make a living? I wish things could stop moving so fast so I could take a break and focus on my mental health then focus on getting my life in order, but I guess that's not how things work. I'm expecting to be on my own in about 7 months, no friends, no job, no car, no money.",20Feb2020,1
10,"Hello there,

I am in a desperate suitation so what better than to come on Reddit. I am 20 years old living in the UK and my mother suffers from Mental health. She is my only family and I have no other family members with me, it’s just me and her. She is 40 years old and throughout my life it’s been a complete struggle. I’m mostly here for my mother and rather just go on about her as now I have stayed away from living at my home and now at a friends for a couple weeks, I have a clearer head. I am very knowledgeable about mental health however I feel like the support system for it isn’t GREAT, especially when you believe my mother doesn’t acknowledge her problems a greater deal than I do, and doesn’t want help, however you can tell, all my friends can tell that well she isn’t all there most days. For now I just want to copy and paste some of my thoughts on her mental health and what traits she has and if anyone could help me in any way especially in the UK on what I should do and what other under lying mental health issues she portrays I’m missing out or should consider to know please let me know. The GP is no help I’ve been there I will go again soon they say she has to come to us asking for help, I can’t just get someone sectioned like that, housing Association are aware of her living conditions and I do remember to think about my life too however I think my mother is so kind hearted below and I do love her, I wouldn’t want to live a life where I didn’t try my best first with her seeing if I could help her mental health out. 

Here are some of my 12am notes I’ve written down about her traits:

Severe depression to the point sometimes she can’t brush her hair or teeth. Been a ongoing thing for YEARS

Suffers somewhat anxiety to get out the car or acts quietly sometimes in public. Not extremely bad though really. 

Has extreme obsessions going on for years from constant messaging a famous guy saying she would very much like to meet him and she likes him very much to the point there she thinks there is a relationship with this man, looking into abortions constantly when not in need of one I think this is related to her past trauma but still goes on 20 years later, asks repetitive questions.

Also she speaks to herself at home or whilst driving. A lot of these conversations are from instagram.

Gets lost in her own thoughts whilst driving - having a scenario in her head and her speaking verbally out which then also affects her driving on main roads as she gets distracted.

She has extreme hoardering/clutter in her home so inability to look after herself or home fails to acknowledge the strain on her relationships and the impact it has due to this. Basically lives in safey and living hazard.

Sometimes forgets routes to common destinations she has driven to many times.

Her mood switches and gets bipolar one minute happy then a couple hours later get angry at nothing or suddenly cry.

When living with her gets extreme moments of anger and constant referrals to her ex husband even though there was a divorce 15 years ago.

Always changes subject when something needs to be addressed as if nothing was said in regards to the issue brought up calmly.

Has said previous counselling never has helped or will help and her life is just damaged/ruined.

Does not take her medication regularly at all, for many years. Only takes Prozac when her low mood gets extremely extremely low for a period then drifts/doesn’t care to take them.

So yeah I’m trying my luck here, I have a great support system of friends but I’m at the point I need guidance on what to do and how to help her she is only 40 and has all these mental illnesses i had to grow up with and had severe depression myself stages in my life from a young age as well.

Thank u for reading :)",20Feb2020,1

12,"I’m getting diagnosed with things/have been diagnosed with stuff. Starting a medication in a couple days to hopefully help one of them. 

But there’s one thing I have been afraid to talk about with my psychiatrist or psychologist. Partially because I don’t know what the hell it is or how to really explain it. 

But I shall try my best right now.

Basically, at certain points in time, my brain just disconnects from reality. It can last from a few minutes to an hour. 

- It feels like I’m watching a TV show instead of it being my vision. 

- All my senses are muffled (especially hearing). 

- I can’t recognize people that I know. 

- If I look in a mirror I don’t recognize the person staring back at me. 

- If I look at a body part, my hand for example, it doesn’t feel like mine. Like it doesn’t belong to me.

- I can’t remember almost anything while it’s happening and it’s hard to recall what happened after the fact

- I can’t remember who I am.

And I guess I’m wondering if I should tell my psychiatrist about this? The psychologist? Should I just let it happen? What even is this?",20Feb2020,1
13,"Hi, so I suppose I should introduce myself. I'm an 18 year old college student in the UK and I never had much freedom in my life.

My current situation is that I'm living with my mum, and basically being a parent to my half brother. My daily routine involves me going to college, coming back home and taking care of my younger brother and then getting maybe an hour to myself before I go to bed. Then the cycle repeats. I baby sit my half sibling on Saturday but I did manage to get Sundays off to myself. However all I really do on Sunday is my school work as that's the only day where I get to catch up.

I can only leave the house on Sunday but there is nothing and nowhere for me to go then. Every place is closed and it's not like I have any friends. I don't find any enjoyment in going anywhere nowadays. I also don't enjoy staying in. Overall I just don't enjoy my life in general. I haven't had a conversation with anyone in a really long time and I have issues that hold me back in life.

The obvious thing do to would be for me to move out. Like come on, I'm 18 but I don't feel like I'm allowed to do that. The only way for me to move out would be for me to quit college as I would need to work enough to support myself financially. But then I would fall into the trap of living a day to day life with little potential for the future. 

I'm in college, working towards getting a good grade so that I can go to university but I don't know what I want to do. I wish I was studying different subjects but I can't change them at this point. I like those subjects but what I want to do is to tell stories through art. What I'm studying won't be completely pointless as I am learning a lot about society and other such things but I wish I could be doing something more creative.

At time point I really don't know what is wrong with me and what I want. I think I been lying to myself because I'm scared but I don't want to admit that. I feel like I live my life by following a set of rules that I didn't set up. It's like a set of rules that I just have to obey. The thought of breaking them scares me. If I'm ill and don't go to college, I feel anxious. 

I wish that I could rebel, do the things I'm not supposed to do. Be myself. I have to lie so much about who I am in real life. I really don't really take care of myself. And now that I think about it, I think it may be because I am not being me and haven't been me ever. 

I been thinking a lot today and came to a realisation today. I'm scared of breaking those rules and it's really holding me back. I suppose in a way I'm basically fitting into a norm that I'm supposed to fit into and I'm denying that I'm not like that, that I'm a bit different, that I'm weak and that I need help. But I am so scared. Lots of things make me anxious but a lot of those things are the things I enjoy. I'm scared of making any changed to myself or doing anything different.",20Feb2020,1
14,"Mkay so. The other day, something weird happened. I texted my friend that sometimes i want to k*ll myself, backwards. Idk why I did it I guess I just wanted help. But I regretted it immediately. I wanted to kill myself for a solid ten minutes, then was okay. Then a little later, the weird stuff happened. I was convinced that I would fall through the floor and die. I was clawing at the floor, and walls. It was terrifying. I also had a weird urge to roll my eyes back in my head and collapse (yes I know how freaky this sounds I’m sorry) and then a little later, I was convinced my dad would kill me with his car keys. I think I knew how ridiculous I was being. I was scared of myself. I still am. I struggle with suicidal thoughts every now and then, and when that was happening, I felt like I would lose control and do it. I really don’t know what happened, or what to do.

Let me start by saying that getting this job was a long process, while I was sludging through that process my new boss made it clear that he wanted me to start working as soon as possible because I am needed. Which is funny because I've felt like the complete opposite since I started, I'm cleaning up after the workers but in the most minimal ways, I feel like he just creates work for me to do most of the time.

17,"After going through a really tough adjustment period working in social work with people that have experienced the same traumas that I have, and talking to my boss about how it’s been affecting my anxiety, I started seeing a therapist through the employee assistance program. It feels so relieving to just be able to put it all out there and link everything together. She praised me for the comparison I made to re-experiencing trauma through work like this:

Everything I’ve been through has been broken down into like a 5,000 piece puzzle. Some of the pieces are right side up, some are upside down. As I go through my life and start to experience some healing, it’s like putting together the right side up pieces to finish the puzzle. Working with kids and remembering bits and pieces about my trauma  is like turning over pieces of the puzzle and realizing that some of the pieces I’ve already put in don’t actually go in that spot so it’s frustrating and causes me anxiety but it’s manageable. But then something chaotic happens and that’s like somebody messing up the puzzle and taking it apart, so I have to start over from whatever is left connected. 

She recommended we look into me being put on anxiety meds for the first time and continuing with some long term trauma response therapy to help me get better at my job. I’m excited to keep going and put the puzzle of healing together.",20Feb2020,1

19,"I’ve been on 10mg lexapro for about six weeks for anxiety. 

Came out of a breakup that really flared up all my mental health struggles but have been actively working towards getting better because I believe a lot of what I struggle with is rooted in my thinking. So have been in therapy, doing my own CBT, reading, watching videos, lots of reflection and therapy, learning to self soothe and self love. 

I feel I made a decision after my break up. I was on a path of self destruction through drinking heavily and steering towards self harm again and really hating myself, chain smoking and not being able to function, and then I made a decision. Do I want to keep feeling this pain, or do I want to feel better? I decided I want to feel better. I want to be happy. And so I started the process. 

I don’t feel anywhere near as anxious anymore, but it’s hard to tell if that’s the lexapro or the shift in my thinking. 

After starting the medication though I have been SO tired. I struggle to sleep at night (which I have basically my whole life) but I used to still be able to wake up at a decent time. Now on lexapro, if I stay up late my body will not let me wake up until I’ve slept at least 10 hours. I actually think it’s made me lazier. I feel so cosy and content I don’t see the point in getting up. I’m basically in bed until 1pm in the afternoon. I just sleep and sleep and sleep. And then by late afternoon I’ll nap again for a few hours. I never used to be able to nap unless I was super tired.

I feel I actually used to have way more energy. Mentally I feel clear but physically I’m just tired all the damn time. If I go for a 30 min walk to try to energise and get exercise, I’m zonked out after. 

Went back to my doc about this and he said to start taking it at night to see if that helps the tiredness. It has a little, but now I get horrible night sweats and I spend all night having vivid dreams and nightmares and sweating through all my clothes and my bed. 

Anyway, what’s your experience with lexapro? I think I’m keen to go back to my docs to get off meds entirely.",20Feb2020,1

22,"For reference I am a 15 year old male. 

I definitely wouldn’t nearly describe myself as depressed, because I do my best in school, even if I cheat half the time, I get out of bed every morning, etc.

But I know I’m definitely not alright either.

I know I have some sort of mental illness or at least a very bad mental state because... nothing excites me anymore. Or at least, it does, for a second. Like when I went to San Juan, Puerto Rico for a trip, I was looking forward to going there all my life but when I got there everything was just so... underwhelming. There are few things I get excited by, and if I get excited by it, it lasts for like 5 seconds then I’m like, meh. 

I’m also lost in my own thoughts 24/7, and I sometimes feel “disconnected”, and have to touch something and feel myself to get reassurance that I know I am real.

I also get very annoyed with parents, I don’t have any “true” friends, just social, and no one in this entire world knows what’s going on inside me, which is why I like my own company and will get drunk and high on any drug when I get a chance.

Which also leads into the next, which is I only feel happy and curious and bubbly about the world only when I’m intoxicated on substances, never have I once felt genuine happiness while not sober. 

Anyway, that’s just a main jhist of my mental health. I could very well just be overthinking normal things, which I have a habit of doing, I even have mild social anxiety.

Unusually, the only thing it doesn’t really affect is sleep. Is there a way to focus it? I have tried, with a good degree of dedication, meditating, playing soothing music, reading, etc. and to no avail. It always has something to say about something.

26,"So I'm 13 year old boy. I am part of a ""faction"" on a video game platform. I am really invested in it, I feel that its partly due to the fun involved, but we also win money. I wanted to also mention that I'm one of the founders, and I find myself not obligated, but wanting to be able to participate due to it. I feel that if I dont participate I'm letting others down.

Since I was about 11, I get anxious and nervous about alot of things. For example in the video game we can get ""raided"" by enemy factions and I'm usually up until 11pm trying to see if they succeed or not. 

I also get nervous about other stuff, such as normal teenager stuff, school assignments etc. When I do feel this anxiety I feel empty in a sense. I feel no emotions other than nervousness. When I say empty I mean nothing els, just this anxiety for whatever it is I'm focused on.

Now I'm wondering how I can be more calm, and hopefully not have anxiety. I dont want to let the game down, because I enjoy it, but I need to find a way to make it not become so ""real"". Would meditation help, anything els? 

Thanks",20Feb2020,1
27,"I’m having one of those surreal nights again. I don’t know how many of you know the type, when you just want to feel something, so all your physical senses are dialled to 11, because mentally/emotionally you are completely numb. I can see things in a whole different way that I can’t explain, and feeling textures and temperatures is far more prominent. I want to cry, I want to sob until there’s no water left in my body, but I can’t. I know the whole “I’m alive but not living” saying is cliché, but it’s terrifying when you realise to what degree it reigns true in your own life. I walk this planet each day, perform different activities, interact with friends and family, go to school, but it’s not for myself anymore. It’s not because I want to or have the will power or energy to. It’s just because I have to.

I’m alive, because I have to be. That’s all I have to say for myself.

I would say “I’m nearly 16, I should be out spending lots of time with my friends savouring it while I can having the time of my life” but it shouldn’t matter what age you are. No one should just be living because they *have* to, it’s torture. They should be living because they enjoy it and they *want* to.

I’ve been on this planet for 1 and a 1/2 decades; lots of people my age enjoy being here - but all I have left to show for myself is insomnia, a constant state of depression, these nights of sensory overload, and when I’m lucky, the odd glimmer of joy. Like, I had a surgery today, and though I was crying through the pain of the anaesthetic needle going into my foot, I couldn’t help but be relieved that I was feeling something real. I don’t want to live my life like this anymore, but no matter what I do I can’t seem to fix it.",20Feb2020,1
28,"FUCK FUCK FUCK

I feel like I’m going fucking INSANE. I can’t stop moving. I feel like my head is filling to the brim and I can’t stop it. My GOD this is fucking TERRIBLE. HOW DO I STOP THIS?!?!?

Someone. Please. Anyone. Help me slow my mind and my body. I don’t know how much longer I can take this.",20Feb2020,1
29,"Introduction 

Psychopathy is a mental/personality disorder under the category of ASPD (Anti-social personality disorder). Psychopathy is a large array of complex psychological and behavioral symptoms. Psychopathy as associated with the term, crazy, you often see the stigma from time to time that psychopaths are future serial killers and they will start killing animals to slowly progress to murdering their own kind like the case of Jeffery Dahmer. Some of the symptoms of psychopathy and sociopathy, maybe a sort of cousin to psychopathy as they are under the umbrella of ASPD, symptoms to get started in this; (Psychological symptoms) a impaired ability to empathize with others, a sense of grandeur and a bold person, lack of guilt or remorse and a impulse of dishonesty. (Behavioral) Pathological lying, superficial charm, juvenile delinquency, is conning and manipulative and a possible promiscuous sexual life and behavior (This may not be in all cases though). 

Phase 1, 

Currently I am mentally ill in the head with a psychological illness my psychiatrist proscribed anti-depressants for. 

The social experiment is on going and the psychological examinations on the effects, the symptoms and the sights of psychopathy gives to a person's psyche. The way I conduct these testings as I keep the experiment a secret sense everyone involved is my psychological Guinea pigs and if my secret goes out, the whole thing will be shattered like pieces of glass under the pressure of a baseball bat. The experiment is a total success and is quite fun in my opinion and I know I am doing it right because I take extensive notes on the reactions I get or don't get in order to keep everything aligned and straight forward. What it all goes down to is putting a special mask over my true self and portraying myself as a mentally ill person who has, (1) Psychopathy, (2) Multiple personalities in one mind, (3) Schizophrenia. I'd be psychotic one moment pissed off and acting like a psychotic freak, beginning to choke that person, lightly but hard enough it hurts, Then I'd tell them I am sorry and start crying and hugging them, I snap from one personality to another in a snap of a finger. My experiment caused lots of fears against me and I am outcasted and shunned in the fear of classmates that lurks in the thick and dark fog, the haze of utter fear and blackness. 

Sometimes I will walk around with scissors in my hands and vaguely stalk and chase my ""Pray"" They run and scream like cattle as I relive devilish eyes that are so plain it is inhuman so I always get the response I need for my psychology notebook journal.

The way I do things is followed down at a memorized list of actions to portray mental illness, scare off people and list them in sections by reactions marked down by stars and crossed in my notebook pages confidential in my office box and now I shall share it with the internet to share my findings and discoveries of psychology. using psychopathy to filter a reaction from someone and continue the process everyday and every week of the month. 

 \-The behavioral acts- 

  \*The words I use are spoken in a monotone and plain voice that insights chills down the spines of my guinea pigs. 

  \*Give off vibes of ultimatums to people but really just bluffing. I got some girls address on a note and the girl said to me in a melancholic voice, a smile of nervousness on her face, ""P-Please do not come to my house, if you do, I won't answer the door."" after I said to her, ""I will be paying you a visit."" 

  \*Use dark humor as the main humor and say you don't care when you offend someone, I feel really bad saying this but I still said it though it was screwed up hard, I said it anyways because the black humor is my escape goat, 

   \*Use weapons to scare away people like scissors, prod around with it with taunting actions and don't be afraid to get your hands dirty. Kids moved across the classroom to stay away from me which lead to me getting a red card on valentines day that had a green heart at the corner saying, ""To my psychotic bestie."" In it it read in black marker, ""Hi CDL I just want to say thank you for being my psychotic best friend and being my bestie and thanks for all the great laughs. Happy day bestie, sincerely your bestie."" I am doing a good job. 

   \*Talk proudly about murder and about psychos like Ed Gein, Jeffrey Dahmer, the zodiac killer and have deep conversations on suicide which kids aren't to fond of. 

   \*Always carry a smile and create deep plans that are so complicated that it will take days to prepare. Someone hired me as their hit-man and told them to follow me on TOR and we will talk about it via private email. She knew I was knowledgeable about killing so she asked me to kill student C so over the weekend I spent all night looking for Student C's email account so I can arrange things in secret. The girl wanted me to kill student C, so I will contact student C and talk about it and stage herself tied in a chair and me wearing a wicker mask with a black fedora and slitting her throat but it is acting we both negotiated in secret. Student C doesn't show up for class, tell her to take a mental health day off so it seems I actual killed her when I show the girl who requested the killing the video and see what she'll do or say. 

Actions and responses 

The students always give off a nervous smile when ever I vaguely imply I am going to erase them off the face of the earth. Sometimes they would just stare nervously at me and I can see through the hellfire that is my eyes that they are scared, scared to the bone and just for extra character to seal the deal, I pull out a pare of barber scissors and raise it to my neck with clasped hands, student D who sits behind me, says, ""I do not trust you around that."" 

   ""Oh why not, Why not?"" I creak my head to the side so far that my sideburns graze the ends of my shoulders and the disks in my neck creak, snap and pop. 

   ""Is it because I am scaring you? WHY AM I SCARING YOU, GIRL?"" I  get up from my desk and drop the blade to the floor with a metal crash, then silence as I put my hand on her chin and get in her face, white beating eyes staring deep into her. 

   ""Come on, don't be shy."" Everyone in the rows scoots their desks back and watch in shock with some even walking away and across the classroom for safety. 

   A lot of the time I natural do these things and act creepy on accident as my experiment is slowly interfering with my life. So indeed this is the answer to what the response of younger generation society responds to a person with raging anti-social personality disorder is resentment of upper classmates, fear and nervousness, intimidation that ruptures deeply in your peers but this may just be the beginning of my social experiment, I will find out what I will find out for stage two and three, or will there even be one at all at this point in time? They fear me now like the cattle against the sound of guns busting smoke and bullets into their peers, they resent and flee, resist and run. 

  I think that the next month I will create a false sense of security and at friendly and nice and see what happens when I turn devilish.

30,"Recently in my country, there has been cases of people getting into trouble with the law because of their mental health conditions (ASD, OCD, trauama). Whenever I pass by such threads and see the comments of laypeople calling for people with mental health issues to be hospitalised, remanded in prisons, or simply isolated from the rest of the world ""until they are fixed"", I cannot help it but jump in to advocate about the perspective and struggles of both clients and therapists working together to cope with mental health issues.

Over time, repeated arguments of non-existent risks that simply manifested from their lack of understanding of mental health issues becomes a draining fight, while getting downvoted for every single request to be more understanding and empathising towards inability to meet social norms becomes suffocating.

How do you guys keep going with the fight? Would love to have some positivity to keep my morale up.",20Feb2020,1
31,"this is more of a vent however   


in my country when ever a major case of domestic violence comes across headlines the same exact thing inevitably happens the conversation turns to all men are abusive all men deserve to die should all men be monitored men deserve harsher punishments for anything they do all men will commit rape men men men men men  


honestly i am so mentally fucking exhausted of this because and i'm sorry if this offends anyone but women simply cannot know what it is like to be a man who has been raped and physically abused you honestly cant because you are not taken seriously and when ever you try to say ""hey i was abused domestic violence happens to men too"" you are just dismissed as ""oh well hes an MRA don't pay attention to him""   


i get laughed at told i deserved it (usually in the context of well a woman just got her own back) told i'm making it up i am so fucking sick of it  my mother beat me i was in two abusive relationships one was manipulative the other one was was violent and actually drugged me once when i had flu and didn't want to have sex   


i am sick of being told daily that i am this born asshole who deserves everything bad that ever happens to me because of whats between my legs i can't actually date anymore for fuck sake i have a phobia of women showing interest in me now i get panic attacks i need to carry around beta blockers    


i tried getting this but was told its still a taboo subject and that they don't have resources for things like this so they instead focused on my combat PTSD thinking it would fix the romance phobia but it never did   


i don't know how to end this but just every time this kind of thing happens in the media the resulting conversations cuts me down and each time it gets worse and worse and i feel like at some point there's going to be a stage that i cannot mentally handle it anymore",20Feb2020,1
32,"I have been paranoid for a very long time. Im terrified people are after me and trying to kill me. I'm not going to get too much into my history but I use to also suffer with severe depression and anxiety but my depression is mostly gone with the help of therapy. I am 21f living for the first time on my own for university and I struggled a little bit last semester but this semester has been relatively smooth and with just adopting my dog, I really felt I could comfortably live in our family vacation home by myself. I stopped triple and quadruple checking the locks, I didn't always lock my bedroom door, I opened 2 blinds from the windows and even turned the kitchen light off at night. But last night I woke up and it sounded like someone was in my house. My heart was pounding out of my chest and I texted my mom over 200 miles away to call the police because "" what if they heard me? They would sure kill me then!"" The police showed up at 4am not more than 5 minutes after I had texted my mom and they couldn't get inside because well the doors were locked. How is there supposedto be an intruderinmy home if the cops cant get inside. I left my room to open the back door which is less than a foot away to let them in. They searched my house and got nothing but were reassuring me that's this is okay and that I can call at any time. I feel ridiculous that I thought someone was in my house and that I heard voices inside. I feel like I hallucinated the voices and my paranoia because they didn't find anything to justify that I heard voices. I barricaded my door before laying in bed tonight. I'm so scared that even though no one was in my house yesterday. They're going to come back today. I feel like I haven't progressed at all. I feel like I lost all that progress and I need someone to live with me again.

33,"I’ve recently been through a bad time and was prescribed fluoxetine 20mg - took it for 6 days but by day 4 the side effects became unbearable so I stopped the meds with doctors advice and took some daily doses of diazapam to help me relax and sleep (anywhere between 2mg-6mg a day) after about 2/3 days of this this stopped working and I would wake up in the night randomly anxious and covered in sweat. Since then I’ve been to see a psychiatrist and he prescribed me quetapine starting at 50mg.
I took it for one night and one night only - it helped me sleep more but still my sleep was disturbed. Does anyone know if it’s okay to just stop taking quetapine after just one dose? I’ve tried looking online and can’t find any information. It’s 2.40am hère, i went to sleep around 11 and woke up at 1am keep averaging 2 - 4 hours (if I’m lucky) sleep a night and it’s becoming excruciating! Anyone have any advice? Thank you :)",20Feb2020,1
34,"I was looking into getting some consultations and such, but there are not a lot of great (or affordable) resources locally where I am. Has anyone had any luck or experience with Lemonaid? I was looking at that or Brightside, but I can't find much information about it online. I live in Colorado in the US.",20Feb2020,1
35,"Hi guys, this has probably been answered before but I just haven't found the post. 

I'm feeling motivated to finally start therapy as I've been on the fence about it for about a year. I'm just so intimidated by the process. Where do I even begin? Do I need a referral from a doctor? I'm scared to call places and ask because I don't want to come off stupid (I'm sure they won't see that way but I have a really hard time asking for help - one of the many reasons why I'm seeking therapy along with childhood traumas that are bubbling to the surface more and more each passing day) 

I don't know anyone that has gone to therapy - or maybe I do know someone but they just haven't shared - so I don't know who to ask for advice. Any time I bring it up to my mom she suggests ""holistic"" coaches and basically people who aren't trained to deal with what I'm dealing with. To give you more of an idea of what's going on in case that can get me some more specific answers, I'm feeling very depressed. I have for a while. But it's gotten to an almost debilitating state and I feel so directionless and hopeless that I can't make a move at all in any area of my life. Any articles I find just feel like fluff pieces that don't actually offer a step by step on how to get an appointment. They tell me to ""start calling places!"" but for someone like me that's hard. What places do I call? What do I tell them? Ugh... Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you in advance.",20Feb2020,1
36,"I’m at a loss. I’ve had depression and anxiety for 11 years now. I’ve been on and off every type of medication with little to no help. As I’ve gotten older, I would say my anxiety has ramped up more (thank you adulthood) and I have been able to manage my depression to an acceptable level. Right now I’m not on any medications. The last couple of weeks at my job have been pretty stressful- we are short staffed, and I took on a project that I originally thought wouldn’t be as difficult as it has turned out to be. I’ve now (for the first time in 11 years) been experiencing what I’m assuming to be physical symptoms of anxiety (heart racing, heart feeling like it’s pounding out of my chest, can’t catch my breath, nausea) for the last couple of weeks. My supervisor took me aside  today and brought up that she has been receiving news that I’ve been negative lately and it’s bringing down everyone at my job and they are worried about me. It took me by surprise because I think I’ve always been pretty good at my job with not being extremely negative because I know how annoying those people can be. I voice when I’m stressed but I typically make a joke out of it and people never reciprocated negatively. I’m just confused and disappointed in myself. I made a doctors appointment for myself in 2 days to make sure everything with my heart is okay and it’s just anxiety and then to discuss going on anxiety meds (again, for the 15th time). I’m trying to think positively about it but I’ve tried SO many different anxiety medications and none have helped. I’m not good at faking being happy so I’m pretty worried about what might happen if these medications don’t help. I wish I didn’t have to work and I could take a couple of weeks off. If you’ve read this far, thanks for listening to me vent, and if you’ve been in a similar situation I would love to hear your story. Mental illness sucks.",20Feb2020,1

39,"I just need someone

Hi my name is Maxx and I’m 18 and a male. I’m in high school right now and well it’s been easier for me. School isnt a problem for me, I actually do quite well and don’t tend to need help with anything. It’s just that a lot has been happening in my life lately and I don’t know what to do and figured someone here might be able to help. Now to what is wrong, I used to live in Florida and I was doing good out there and was fairly happy had doing well mentally out there, but I had to move from Florida back to Illinois, where I was raised. I lived with my mom and she got sick and we lost our house and a lot of stuff happened and I had to move back to Illinois. When I moved back I was 17 and I’ve been having mental health problems since. I even tried to kill myself once by cutting my vein, but I guess I didn’t cut deep enough and I happened to be in my car so I was driving on the highway and drove into a ditch going 120mph and didn’t have a seatbelt on. I though that would kill me but I ended up just braking my back and was fine otherwise. I convinced my family the large cut on my arm was from the glass from the window. I’ve had no prior mental health history so they believed me and besides I hadn’t talked to them often when I lived in Florida so no one knew if I had problems. They made me see a therapist once to make sure and I lied about it all and said it was just an accident. Recently my sister and stepmom got into a fight and my stepmom left for a week and I was worried we lose our house like I did in Florida and I stressed out quite a lot from that. She didn’t tell us where she was and really I didn’t care because she is a bitch as is, but she finally came home. A lot else has happened too but all this is just the recent things. My grandma had also went to the hospital at the same time and I was worried for her and I had to watch her house while she was in the hospital. She is fine now it was just stressful then. I live in a lower-middle class house hold and I work to get money for myself and to pay my medical bills from my car crash. The bills add up to over $5k and I’m only 18 and I’ve been paying them since it’s happened. The problem is my boss hates me for whatever reason. It’s not like I’m a bad worker or I have a bad attitude towards her, I work in retail and do my job (in my opinion) well. I recently was sick, as it’s that time of year, and it was around the holidays and I still went to work for 4 days in a row while still attending school. My other managers I was working will all said I was really sick and should take a day off and I did. My manager got mad at me and cut my hours down to 4 hours a week. Then the other week i had a few drinks because I was stressed and sprained my foot like an idiot. It happened on a Thursday and I had work Friday and Saturday. I called off Friday because I couldn’t walk and I gave plenty of time to find someone else to work and even went in on Saturday. My job we aren’t allowed to sit down unless we are on break so it’s a lot of walking and I worked open to close Saturday. My boss has taken me off the schedule for 3 weeks since it’s happened and I’ve been looking for another job and the stress has just kept on pilling up. Then this morning came around and I’ve been having problems with my stomach lately and was violently getting sick at 4 in the morning. My dad didn’t believe me and just told me to go to school and ignored the rest I had to say. Then my grandma came to take me to school and I said I was sick and wasn’t going. I’ve been sick for a couple weeks and haven’t been able to keep down food unless I smoke thc before eating. My dad is fine with me smoking and it helps with my stress and my back, along with my stomach. So my grandma and I started to argue and I felt bad because she got out of the hospital a couple days ago. I just didn’t want to go to school and I said some things about my dad and him not caring, because he hasn’t shown it or even acted like it at all. I understand he is stressed too but I mean he just doesn’t ever listen and if he does he just yells at me. He is a good father, don’t get me wrong, but lately he’s only been making it harder for me and hasn’t even seemed to care the least about me. My moms family had disowned me when I moved to Florida with her, except for a few people, it’s a large family. I just want help and I hate talking to therapists because I was forced to see one when my parents got a divorce and I just don’t like them. I’ve seen 4 different ones for various reasons, none really related to any of my problems, and I just don’t like them. I don’t like telling them about my problems. So I came here.

I lost my former potential job during the hiring process due to substance issues. Now, I’m currently employed the ONLY other mental health agency I can work for here. The company I had applied to and didn’t work for is falling to pieces, and the two people (one would have been my supervisor, one my coworker) will now be working by my side, again because there is nowhere else to even apply to work. The individual that would have been my coworker actually evaluated me at our local hospital (post meeting me during my interview there) when I was a mess at the time. It was a huge mistake, I’ve been sober since, and literally no one else knows. Less than 10 people work in my current company, and I’ll be alone with them most of the time so I can’t imagine avoiding the topic. I do trust their abilities as therapists, for example regarding confidentiality.

I have a beautiful girlfriend who’s incredibly sweet and caring but I honestly don’t seem to feel much from the relationship which is upsetting to me. I havent been doing much outside of school besides a little bit of video games, YouTube, music. I haven’t always been like this in fact I used to really enjoy high school and spend more time with friends but I just don’t really care anymore. I’m not really depressed necessarily, I get out of the house just fine I don’t really feel sad so much as just frustrated as to why nothing is really bringing me joy.

49,"Well, it’ll be more like seeing a psychiatrist of my own free will. I was hospitalized and diagnosed with MDD a little over a year ago after a suicide attempt. 

Though, I’m not convinced that their diagnoses were very accurate. Their questions just made it seem like they were saying “you either have depression, anxiety, both, or neither” and those were the only options. I still feel like there’s something wrong with me that isn’t being addressed. 

I currently experience symptoms of social anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, and body dysmorphia and don’t know where to begin in talking about them to a doctor. 

Would it be ignorant/unhelpful for me to speculate disorders I may have based on my symptoms or should I only share what I’m experiencing that makes me feel this way without mentioning any diagnoses?",20Feb2020,1

I used to think that it was just because I wasn’t getting enough sleep, but no matter what I do the paranoia never ends. I am incredibly uneasy about certain things that just stay and click, for example I will be fully convinced that someone will be following me everywhere and every time i turn around they have already been studying my every move, therefore they already know where to hide. Undistinguishable chatter like loud talking around me; knowing that people are talking but unable to fully distinguish what they are saying really freaks me out. I get very offended very quickly and when i hear that chatter i always hear them talking about me. I start to feel uncomfortable about my posture and hand and feet placement and always end up feeling very very uneasy. I always feel them making fun of me. I feel like my friends do the same when I can’t hear them properly, but seem like i can hear them. The days I do not get much sleep I’ll hear whispers, sometimes identifiable sounds and voices and i’ll ask the people around me and they wont hear anything, I always tell myself that it’s not real and that I am just tired, but it’s always very difficult for me to decipher what is reality and what is in my head. Not only that, but I will have these dreams while I am asleep about certain real life people that I have only seen never communicated with, and become extremely uncomfortable with them in person because I feel like all that in my dream also happened in reality, but I tell myself that I can’t be uncomfortable by something like that but I can’t help it. I feel in a way that I am special, and that some how everything is a sign meant for me and that everyone really is taking and looking at me.

I'm living with some family friends right now because my dad lost his apartment about a year ago and didn't have the means to take care of me. I have a job and I'm not really getting very many hours, I'm 17 right now but my birthday is next week and I am very excited to be an adult. When I turn 18 I'm planning on reapplying to a grocery store that's near me and hopefully that will be full time, and I'm going to be taking a high school exit exam in March.

All this is to say that I've been forced to grow up very quickly, I used to take care of my younger brother when our mother would go out drinking and come back and hit me. Admittedly, I've seen a lot in my life so far and I'm very antsy to get out of my city. I know I can't do it right now but I feel so antsy living where I am and I've lived in the same county my whole life and I just want to get out of here.

I have no savings and no job lined up where I'm moving and I haven't even ever been to Portland, but my uncle thinks that I would love it up there so I'm giving it a shot.

Ever since that statement today I’ve been in a funk. I went to therapy today and my therapist said you are in a better mood and I’m glad your not crying but if you need to feel free.

I have been biting my lips and my cheeks for as long as I can remember. my old therapist proposed that it’s just anxiety, but I pinch and bite pretty much all day every day, especially when my mind is on fire (usually if I have to concentrate my attention on something, like reading or listening to someone talk). is this maybe add or something?

My response to her was that I’m human and we are over loaded with work. My response should have been to just say okay and tell her I’d fix it.  She got more pissed off at me. I went to my office and the tears started coming down so I went to close the door so that no one would see me.  She took that as me slamming the door (my door shuts hard on its own) and called me back to her office to give me a write up.  She wrote that I have issues with making mistakes then went to list any mistake I’ve ever made in the past year, how I lost control and slammed the door, talk back and the list goes on and on. 

I tried to explain to her that I didn’t slam the door but she yelled at me more and told me that I’m not there to talk to her. I was there to read the write up and sign in.  She also said that I don’t need to act like a 5 year old.  That I should grow up.  I ended up writing my reasoning on the page and she walked away smirking.

64,"Working with the public has got to be the worst.  I've worked off and on with over a decade now with the public.  On top of general animalistic issues with people, there are personal domestic issues.  Some people have come to my work, threatened or insulted me.  I have come a long way from losing my self control.  I have never attacked anyone in cold blood, I've only lost control and started raging in the past.  It's been years and I'm quite proud, it still gets hard.

This is my job, I can't afford to lose right now do to financial obligations.  I have to get the hell out of this Demonic infested village though.  It's a university town, I've mentioned in the past, there are cults here.  There are cults in many towns, in Universities there are several cults.  This isn't something typically discussed, you know of some of those big cults, many are still under the radar.  I have no idea what branch or relation these local cults have with bigger ones (Involving the Gods)? 

I was targeted years ago and only idle threats and irregular incidents of harassment have transpired.  There had been some incidents of hostility over the years, nothing I'm not game for.  Then people turned the shit around on me for not leaving.  Like, I'm obliged to go to battle with these people, then people got mad at me. I don't do anything, I stay in, told the cops everything.  I've mentioned how difficult the situation is and I'm just encouraged to leave town.

 It's funny fucking world we live in where a criminal mob of idiots get to screw people. The Authorities are obligated to dissolve the one person to control the situation.  So I keep my head down, I really don't do anything, this had been going on years.  I didn't mean to be here this long and now it's been 6 years and I'm burdened to stay 1 more at least to get finances together.  I had been piss poor for years, just found a moment and decent paying job to try and relax and enjoy some novelty before resuming destitution.

I get all psyched out when these people come around.  Nothing ever seems to happen.  They would come to my apartment, shout and threaten me, drive off.  I never give in to chase them, I'm certain I'm the one that will get fucked by the police.

It's exciting at times.  I've been out of the military 10 years.  It's the only action I get is these local G's.  

It's screwing up my life though, I was alienated and also kind of alienated myself with my behavior.  I had also joked about being schizophrenic at times and I'm really not.  It's not a situation I can get out of, it's just fucked.  However, I was alienated as delusional before I started joking about it.  I don't even care, perhaps I can redeem myself in time and actions.  I had some issues in the past, those had been remedied, and I came clean about drug and alcohol use.  I composed myself and with therapy and guidance had really come to realize it's a phase most people go through.

When all this started I co-operated with police to the best of my abilities.  Nothing amounted to shit as these people exploited the cops multiple times.  Calling them never helps as they show up and I am assless with no evidence.  I had tried to acquire evidence, license plates, frequent establishments, finger prints, addresses, pictures, video, witness testimony.  These people are really good at exploiting the law.  

These cults, human trafficking, slavery, came into question.  I was told to keep my wits about me before I got kidnapped, and sold off to some people that were going to wear my little asshole out, torture and murder me.

This weird 'mental thing' ( I have no vocabulary to name this) no longer happens, I'm in my 40s, but happened a lot as a child and faded in my twenties. I never made a big deal of it because when it happened it was just ""normal"". I found myself thinking lately as to why this no longer happens, which then leads my thinking into why this even occurred in the first place.
I'll try to explain. 
From as long ago as I can remember, my 'thoughts' sort of faded into the back of my head and other thoughts not my own would come forward.... Sometimes it was random sounds or talking I couldn't understand.  I could feel this coming on and would just think ""ok here it goes"". Nothing frightening but I could 'feel' a change happening. My own mind just waited in the background until the episode was over.... Usually a few minutes.... Then it faded. I could function as I still had control and was fully aware of what was happening. 
It really is hard to explain.  
There was not anything specific that would happen before it occurred. It was always completely random and occurred frequently. This happened, as far as I can remember, into my twenties. I basically just ignored when it happened and kept doing what I was doing until it went away.

81,"So, I've been wondering if I'm just very sensitive or mentally ill. Im 14 btw.
A week ago we watched a movie called ""they shall not grow old"" about the WW1. We know alot about wars and how many they were, when they were and so on. But It seemed kinda normal to me when I talked about them or told people about them.
But what I never realized is how terrifying they actually are. This movie really showed me reality. I never would've thought they would be that bad even though I knew so many people died under bad circumstances to say the least.
I feel bad for never realizing. So, now the important part. 
As the movie went on and the people actually started fighting, I was utterly terrified and shocked. All the noise together with the screaming made me tear up and I tried to hold it in because I didn't want to embarrass myself infront of my friends.
I was so shocked. Not even because of all the dead bodies, I mean they were really disgusting, but that wasn't what made me tear up.
I just felt so incredibly bad for the people that had to fight, I almost started crying like a baby. It felt so wrong and I had a weird feeling in my stomach. 
We had only 45 minutes to watch a part of the movie so we would watch 45 the next time. When the teacher closed the pc and we were packing our stuff for the next class I was still so in shock. But what made me question that It was ""normal"" for me to feel that way is that everyone was laughing again and playing it off. I just couldn't understand how you could possibly laugh after seeing something like that?
I thought to myself ""Am I the only one that was so shocked and almost had to cry?""
At home I told my sister about the movie and as I started explaining about the movie I started tearing up again and this time I cried for literal hours. I don't know what's wrong with me tbh.
The next part made me tear up again and then again. I was either very sensitive or just kinda ill because the other kids couldn't give less of a shit and the only thing they said was ""eww the dead bodies are so gross"" and started laughing.
I don't understand?!

I won’t plan to do it, if I do it it will be spontaneous. I can’t really stop it *or* force myself to do it. Why tf am I like this???? I know I need to go back to a psychiatrist.

94,"Ok, I just want to vent about my life at the moment, It's not like its permanent. I probably won't write much but I'm in the hardest part of my life yet and venting is the only way I can make it through this. I'm a 15-year-old guy in High School. Throughout all of my early education, I was told I had trouble ""focusing"" and never listened to teachers. I missed a ton of school and my grandparents (guardians) took me to shrinks and just thought I was a spoiled rotten brat. I began having bouts of early anxiety attacks at ages 8 or even 7. I had thoughts about the fear of our existence is limited and nihilistic fears. I was able to go through my life but I'd have these horrible attacks where all I could think about is how we're going to die and nothing is worth it and how horrible it is I was punished by being put on the Earth. very intense stuff for a child. I would cry all night. They all went away though, no idea why. My life got better and better and I was doing increasingly good in school. In 6th grade, I was doing horrible with the new environment and could never do homework. I went to transfer to an online school and never ended up signing up so I was stuck in limbo without school. The next year I had to repeat 6th grade I did alright because there was barely any homework because I was placed in the ""dumb"" classes. I did so well in those classes I skipped 7th grade and went back on track to 8th and passed with soaring scores. I got into high school with college and AP classes with a 3.2 GPA right off the bat. I had a ton of homework. I still had the habit of missing school from all my life. It became a go-to thing. I started missing some school and the work overtook me. I had so much work to do and I was too scared to say anything to my teachers. Whenever I'd have the work in front of me I'd get distracted by hobbies. Hours and hours on YouTube and calls with friends. I just had fun and forgot about school. My school self and real self completely split. I noticed I was having more fun not focusing on the schoolwork that I just sat there and stressed on and never completed. I started prioritizing having fun and forgot about all my work. My grades are almost all F's. this is hitting me hard though, Everyone around me thinks I'm stupid. My grandma hates me for driving her nuts every morning arguing about going to school. The county is going to ban me from getting a driver's license until I'm 18 for missing school. I could even get arrested. At this rate, I'm going to drop out of high school. I don't want to work because I don't even know If I believe in having fun while working anymore. When I was a child I always thought I'd be able to go to Stanford and work at some super cool game company where I can work on cool games all day. Now that just seems out of reach. My stress is immeasurably large. I have assignments due today that I haven't done. It's so horrible seeing me be a letdown to everyone including myself. I feel like garbage and I feel dumb. I was always told I was incredibly gifted knowing several coding languages at only 8. I was always so smart but now I'm just looked down on. I tried getting into relationships but It seems nothing worked out there either. My grandpa has dementia too so I have to deal with him. He can be incredibly annoying and it almost seems like he purposefully annoys me. My grandma has had enough of him too and that brings the entire mood of the house down. She was very skeptical when I said I think I have ADHD. I just know it. I see how other people live and how easy it is for them to take out their binders or notebooks and start working. But here I am writing a Reddit post at 4:58 AM staying up all night when I have an assignment due at 7 AM. All of this has brought back those anxiety attacks from earlier. I now have these nihilistic out of body experiences every once and a while because of the stress. I've even started balding due to stress. Stress is just overtaking my life. Its all work work work money money money happy happy happy but I am not getting anything out of this. I'm struggling. I don't know what to do and I don't want suicide I just want to wish I were never put into this society and world. It honestly feels like I don't fit into this working class. I don't want to go to school because I see no point in it. It just brings my mind to my missed grades and assignments. Everyone around me with their cheeky smiles and wonderful grades complaining about C's is killing me. I have 20s and 10s as grades. I miss weeks on end. What would medication solve? Would It really help me focus on my work? Do I have depression because I've lost care for life? I honestly just might drop out of high school and run away to NYC and live out my dreams like Casey Neistat. be some unoriginal youtube guy. No idea what I'll do with my life and that's what scares me. These decisions shouldn't have to be made by a kid who was 13 and carried up until now. Is there even hope for my education? I just want answers to my life and if what I'm doing is truly going to end me up homeless and sad akin to how the world portrays. How do I handle my grandma? How do I make her love me even though I'm a failure?

I used to selfharm and have suicidal thoughts. But I've been clean for about a year now. Only recently I talked about it with my best friends and girlfriend who all suffer from depression and have selfharmed before.
The urge to selfharm has come back and I've started thinking about the thoughts I had back then. I don't know if that means the suicidal thoughts have come back or are coming back. 

I've been thinking about the plans I made on how I'd kill myself a lot recently. Not necessarily making plans, just remembering the thoughts I had back then. 

I also have lots of trouble with social situations.
I don't know if it's only because of my speech disorder or If it could be social anxiety.
I can't order in restaurants, make phone calls, talk to the cashier, etc. Without becoming extremely nervous, shaking hands or crying.
It's especially bad with things like talking in front of people. I will start shaking and sometimes I can barely breath.

I've decided to talk with my therapist about it. 
I'm afraid he won't take me seriously or that It is not really something important.

Also, his problem might be drugs-related, but I take no drugs, even no alcohol. As I am growing older (I am 32) I am noticing that it is getting more serious. It is specially annoying when I ride a plane, go to the movies or just share my bed with someone, because people usually think I am being obnoxious with me just not sitting still. When I notice that others noticed, I get more self-conscious and I do it even more. It is also more serious when I am wearing formal clothes like a suit or something tighter. If I am at home in my pajamas I can sort of manage it.

I have never been able to sleep cuddling with a woman, because as soon as they place their head on my chest/shoulders I get incredibly uncomfortable and I feel the urge to move and adjust my position.

116," 

Hi.. I need some help before this problem gets out of control, but this is very personal and maybe even a trigger for some people.

I don't remember much about my life growing up, but there are memories I don't think will ever leave me. I was molested by my own uncle when I was only 4, and I was raped at my ex-best friends house when I was 7 years old. I was in court for what felt like my entire childhood. Other sexual attempts were made that I remember bits and pieces of.. I just remember trying to survive through all of this and feeling so tired. I missed out on so much school from that and defending myself from bullies...I felt like the whole world was leaving me behind. I was depressed and suicidal by 10, but I never told anyone.

What saved me, is what I hate and love the most. Somewhere along the line, I created a man that I can't get over... when I think he's gone out of my head, he comes back, no matter what I do, no matter how happy I think I am, no matter how much I think I don't need him anymore, he comes back, for long periods of time until he disappears from me again. I've gone to lengths searching for anyone that could even remotely be him, and end up in a world of pain when I realize I will never find him in real life. So now... what once saved me is killing me. I have dreams, fantasies, a specific look. Black hair, blue eyes, a name, a voice, a style to match. I've fallen in love with someone who isn't real. A part of me doesn't want it to stop, but I know that I need it to.

I'm 23 years old now, and I've been in recovery for suicidal ideation for awhile. I've gone to professional help and have been diagnosed with many things, but I was told that this part of my situation is normal, that it's just a phase. But it is a phase that is hurting me deeply, almost to a point where it's dangerous.

I need advice, on how to get him to go away.",20Feb2020,1

I wanted to say things but at the same time my mind was thinking ”do not cry”. The therapist noticed and said that it was okay to cry in here and show your emotions. The only answers I could get out were ”I don’t know”, ”I can’t describe”, or just a sound of confirmation like mhm or yeah.

120,"So, well, I've been in depression and anxiety treatment for almost three years now. It's been very long because I did quit the first try and the second was with a different doc. 

I used to be very skeptical about what my issue was. Indeed I did avoided drugs and put all my efforts on psychology and self care. It didn't work. I waited perhaps 5 years to visit my first psychiatrist. 
I've been thru maybe 5-6 antidepressants, several hypnotics, antipsychotics and anxiolytics. Failed a suicide attempt last year and really had a very awful depression and anxiety time. Every night very vivid nightmares, mania by days and feeling constantly like about to crash myself. 

Anyhow, as my question says, I'm just tired of people trying to persuade me everything is psychological alone. It's fine I think if they think I'm a ""weak"" mind or as many have told me ""you haven't tried hard enough"". I don't have to convince no one about what's my problem and why I chose this solution but it's getting really tedious to keep my comments for me and not explode to people with this type of unsolicited comments/opinions. 

I'm finally in the last part of my treatment. Might be out in maybe three or two more months.

121,"When people are feeling anxious, sad, lonely, etc. it can often feel as if they are trapped in a dark tunnel with no idea of how to get to the end. Sometimes it can feel so dark that they don’t want to find their way out because the thought of facing that tunnel is terrifying, and it seems pointless even trying because they know they’ll just be wandering around aimlessly in the dark.

Now think of every kind word, every smile, every hug.. as a candle. That one flame may not be enough to get them through that tunnel, but it makes it a little less dark than before. Every positive gesture, no matter how big or small, makes that journey through the tunnel seem a bit more bearable, and the more candles that are lit, the brighter the tunnel becomes. 

Unfortunately it also works the other way around, and these days it seems far too ‘normal’ for people to blow each others candles out. I’m sure we have all been guilty of it, and it may not always be intentional, but every cruel word, every snigger, every rumour etc. can make someone’s tunnel even darker. We all really need to remember that actions have consequences and words can have a tragic impact. There is no way of knowing how many candles anybody has lit, and just one nasty comment could leave somebody feeling alone in the dark. 

Remember that you never truly know what someone is going through, you never know how dark their tunnel is and it costs absolutely nothing to be nice. It can be so simple to ignite a little flame inside of someone to try and ease some of their pain, and if you can’t manage that, at least make a conscious effort not to blow any candles out. 
If everybody stopped contributing to the darkness, it would make it a bit easier to reach the light at the end of the tunnel.

123,"I have struggled with this most of my life without knowing why. 

Recently I have been dating this guy for almost two months and at the same time been going some personal issues where I have been quite depressed and negative for the longest I can remember. My mood has been at rock bottom for so long that each day brings some kind of misery and dissatisfaction 

I’m angry about how I’m acting and even more angry about how I project it onto others. I have been violent towards my cats and get very very angry when they do things they’re not suppose to do. Many times I’ll toss them away or hit them and the guilt that comes from seeing them run away in fear and look at me like “Why would you do that to us?” just frustrates me more. I love animals and my intent is never to hurt any of them but they at times are the outset for my anger and the depression I’ve been experiencing.

In order to cover up my feelings especially for a romantic relationship like the one I’m in, I make playful insults to them, am very sarcastic, and also play fight. Many times I’m not aware of how annoying this can be to someone or I have this compelling desire to do that with no ill intent. 

He told me this yesterday and it just made me cry because I feel like I’m just ruining what we have together because I repress my emotions so much. 

Getting lovey dovey with someone especially in public makes me uncomfortable but I want to do it. I was so of disgusted my kissing until I was doing it with someone I genuinely care about.

I feel like a terrible, bitter person and I don’t mean to be. But my head is not in a good space right now and I have no beings of letting it out.

I’m seeing a therapist so that suggestion is out. However I’m also going to be seeing a psychiatrist for the first time next Friday and I’m excited because I feel like only then I will get the answers I need. I just want someone to analyze me and dig into me because I’m tired of feeling like this for years and seeing it manifest in such a negative way and feeling like I’m getting nowhere.

I have sex to forget how I feel not really cause I enjoy it, smoke marijuana, drink alcohol, shop, overindulge, write screenplays and books of how I wish my life was like and just a lot of things to try to not deal with the way I’m feeling.

To start, I’m sixteen, male and have a history of frequent weed use, meaning I have some decent points towards schizophrenia. I am very irritable, my memories are distorted, I keep hearing my name from voices I shouldn’t be able to hear (old family friends, dead people I knew, etc).

To explain the distorted memories, my family has pointed out several (I’m not exaggerating when I say tens to hundreds) holes in my memory, where I don’t remember entire conversations or in a few instances, the full day. 

Time also feels distorted for me, to the point that I didn’t even notice I had been working for six months (I thought it had been one month).

I’ve always had a rather...antisocial personality but it’s been worse recently. I was shocked to discover that people DONT try to actively manipulate the other side of a conversation, and it is in fact NOT normal to enjoy seeing others in distress.

Idk maybe I’m making something of nothing but all these things can’t be coincidences right??",20Feb2020,1
129,"Background summery

before 2019:

So before 2019 I was overweight, had no confidence, didn't have luck maintaining friendships, felt defeated (felt like everyone was against me), bad mental health, etc. Basically I considered myself a textbook loser. My mental health just seemed to get worse the more I socialized and put myself out there. I was also a financial mess, working a minimum wage job to make debt payments so I can attend a school to get a degree that wont guarantee a job.  

After 2019: 

At the beginning of 2019, I stopped trying to maintain friendships, I started going to the gym, changed my perspective - stopped beating myself up, consider my own opinion of myself before I consider others, became more focused, more productive, have since quit university, etc. 

Present day 2020: 

So at this point, I have bettered my mental health immensely, I have a completely different perspective on life, I have lost 70-80 lbs and now im looking into a trade program that's free and leads to a paid placement. But even with this transformation, I feel like socially nothing as changed with other people. Its like I keep running into people who still think we are in hs and engage in this extremely cliquey behavior. Like if I don't check their boxes, I'm automatic trash, judgemental af, etc. I find this behavior extremely toxic and I personally don't think it reflects mature adulthood. What bothers me even more about these types of people is sometimes they are in a worse situation than you and me.... Like personally as an adult, I try to be social with all different types of people, I dont limit myself to a select group 🙄. So basically what I'm getting at here, is I bettered my situation by self improving my physical, mental health and personal finances without having to rely on girls or the social clique for moral support. But at what age do these people grow up? Seriously? I guess it goes with living in a small community. No word of a lie, I have had to work with this one girl who was over 40 but acted like she was a 16 year old. 

Conclusion: 

In my opinion, these types of people are best avoided if you are trying to better yourself and your mental health situation. As I've proven in my post, there is nothing wrong with me. Being my own leader has done more for my mental health than anti depressants. You don't need friends, friends need you. Be respectful and build someone up who you have an interest in and continue to engage if the feelings are mutual. Move on to the next person of theyre not. I have found this perspective has helped guide me towards the right kind of people, helping build friendships and intimate relationships. I hope this post helps people who are surrounded by negative forces improve their situation and help conquer the next day. You are what you want to be; if you want to be a winner then be a winner! Have a nice day everyone. 🙂",20Feb2020,1

131,"Long story short, I have a ""book"" I have been writing on and off since 2012 on wattpad and in real life notepads. I dropped it for a couple years then picked it up after I got into a relationship with a girl who actually showed interest in it, so I moved it over to wattpad and wrote a lot more . We broke up in 2016 and ever since, whenever I write. As little as a chapter or just proofreading to fix the grammar of the old chapters: I get overwhelmed by a sad, gloomy and defeat feeling. It can be as bad as ending the day right there and going to sleep no matter the time or to even have a sleep paralysis episode. Which in and out of itself does give me great ideas to write stuff but I can't without it happening again obviouslly.

I’ve been told I may be bipolar or have some spectrum of schizophrenia. I’ve had especially bad problems with relationships and I’ve been in a ton of them. It’s very rare that my relationships last longer than a few months and I’ve never had one last longer than a year. When I’m single I can manage symptoms really easy but I’m very lonely and feel empty at times. When I get into a relationship at first I notice my symptoms are greatly reduced I even feel good. I know I love people to hard as I’ve been lonely my whole life and most people run away or abandon me and I have psychotic breaks and months of recovery afterwards. All that said, I’ve recently fallen for my coworker and we proceeded to have a relationship of sorts but not officially. She’s had a really fucked up life and also has a ton of mental disorders but she’s treated me better and has been more understanding than anyone else. One day she sat me down and said she wasn’t tossing me about but we had to back things off until she figured her self out. But we continued to talk all day every day and occasionally go out together. After that talk happened I became a mess and my symptoms have been overwhelming. Very recently I realized I just needed to leave her alone but that’s hard to do when we work together. I just acted very distant and she continually asked if I was okay. Later that day I found out my area manager was coming in and he is aware that me and her have something going on and we both got talked to about it before but denied everything. He came in that day and I left before anything could happen with me. He pulled a few people including my girl into the office and talked with them. I noticed she left me on delivered longer than usual and panicked and called her. She said everything was fine and they didn’t talk about anything that had to do with us. But she has not texted me back in almost 24 hours and never does this. I’m sitting here about to go into work not knowing what’s about to happen. My symptoms are extreme panic, nausea, shortness of breath ,extreme feelings of despair, suicidal thoughts, my body feels like it’s tingly numb and vibrating and it’s especially bad in both arms were they feel like there’s electricity.

But l went to check the other guy fb and saw that he went to africa to volunteer and then studied abroad and I thought wow and I'm here still in the same college where we met ect

137,"I have been using tobacco for about 4 years since I have turned 18, and I have noticed it improving my life in ways that I did not expect, however, I am thinking this is not normal and might have had some strange mental problems. 

So, one of the first things I noticed with tobacco is that it gave me a lot of motivation to do things I did not like doing. I was no longer super annoyed about having to do yard work or homework. Before tobacco, I was a much lazier person, but maybe that could also be attributed to me being less mature or more depressed (I will address that later).

I also noticed that tobacco made math much easier to learn. In high school, I was making D's in Algebra II, and I was ready to go into a job like graphic design that did not require much math. Once, I got to college where I could puffed on a cigar before class, I noticed I was better able to focus on paying attention, and started making A's. I kept going with math and now I'm in Calculus III, where I thought I'd never reach. 

Tobacco has mostly cured me of my depression. When I was in public school, possibly starting in elementary school, I got depressed. Most of my childhood sucked. It wasn't that I was abused or anything. It's just that I didn't expirience much overwhelming happiness by having a lot of friends. This occured up through high school, so I don't know if having a huge lack of dopamine really screwed me up. High school is where I got to my lowest point. In my senior year, when I starting using tobacco, I suddenly felt super comfortable talking to people and was able to think more clearly and have better abilities with social skills. 

Did tobacco just treat my depression, or did it treat some other mental problem I'm not aware of?",20Feb2020,1

I know I should get help, but talking about my feelings has always been stressful and uncomfortable for me.

Plus my mom is pretty emotionally abusive… Just this morning she called me and my sister p*ssies because we didn't talk back to her while she was yelling at us. And whenever I cry in front of her she'll hit me or in one case, call me a b*tch. (Which is where I'm pretty sure my discomfort about discussing my feelings comes from.) Even a few months ago she said to all of us that the only reason she doesn't beat me and my two sisters is because our dad is against that kind of parenting.

- over analyse everything that someone else said and what It meant they thought about me

- time where I thought I couldn't trust any of my own thoughts

- scared that people in my family would die and I couldn't cope with them dying

- feeling guilty for happiness when others aren't or that I don't deserve it

163,"It's been 10 months now. 10 months of hell. My anxiety and depression has risen to an unbearable level. I have tried with the different therapists and all of them were greedy and not helpful at all. None of the medicines have worked, even though they reduce the level of my anxiety attacks. I'm 16 years old and my illness is mainly related to my school stress. I am extremely anti social. Even my parents don't know what to do anymore. I was always good in studies and that was the only thing I liked about myself, I have no other hobbies or interests, I used to play sports and was in the soccer team but my knee got badly injured and I haven't been able to play ever since. I was very fat and I reduced my weight and became extremely fit but now again I have gained 16 kgs in the last 10 months. Nothing makes sense to me. I don't like anything.

164,"So I know this post would be more appropriate to post on the Bipolar subreddit, but it takes 30 takes to get approved and without approval your post is queued until a moderator can review it. I joined this subreddit a while back so I thought I’d post here.

Since I was around middle-school-aged I’ve been depressed or anxious or both the majority of the time. I’m in my early-20s now. Currently I’m diagnosed with 
Unspecified mood [affective] disorder, unspecified anxiety disorder, and ADHD predominately inattentive type. There are a lot of overlapping symptoms so I try to focus on treating my symptoms, and not focusing on a diagnosis. 

Over the past two or three weeks I’ve felt really good. Definitely one of the longest sustained periods of feeling good I’ve had in my life. It didn’t hit me until today that perhaps it could be hypomania. But it could always just be that I haven’t been depressed or anxious and what I’m feeling is just a normal mood.

I study psychology at university so I’m aware of the hypomania criteria, and I seem to be exhibiting some of the symptoms associated with hypomania rather strongly. Namely, decreased need for sleep and an increase in goal-oriented activity. 

My sleep has never been great, whether it’s sleeping too much or not sleeping enough, but the past few weeks I haven’t been sleeping a lot at all and I don’t feel like I need it. I’ve pulled all-nighters and felt great the following day. 

I’ve always had an interest in filmmaking and stand-up comedy, but the past few weeks I’ve been doing extensive research on the craft and execution of filmmaking, to the point of the working on multiple screenplays. It’s like I can’t get enough information on the subject. As for stand-up, I’ve been writing jokes consistently for the first time in a long time, and it seems like everything I write is golden. I really just feel like I have one good idea after another, and I stay up late writing because when I lay my head on my pillow I keep thinking of ideas. I feel like for the first time I’m pursuing my goals in a meaningful way, after desperately wanting to for years, and floundering time after time. 

Also, I’m usually a really quiet person. Even if I have something that I feel can contribute to a discussion in class substantially, I don’t speak up. If there’s a person that I think looks interesting and I’d like to initiate a conversation, I find any reason to pass up the opportunity. But lately I’ve been a lot more engaged in my classes and different social settings. Answering questions, cracking jokes, initiating conversations. 

I haven’t worked in over a year. I’ve learned going to school full-time and working is too much for me to handle. I become an anxious mess and rescind into a child-like state of dependency. But in the past week alone, I’ve applied to a half a dozen jobs.

So what’re y’all’s thoughts? Is this what it feels like to not be depressed, or am I experiencing hypomania and it’s just a matter of time before I crash?

I understand y’all aren’t medical professionals. I just want to know if you have any experience distinguishing between hypomania and a good/normal mood. I see a therapist weekly and I see my psychiatrist rather frequently as well. However, I just saw my therapist yesterday and I didn’t make the connection until this morning.

I should also mention that I’m medicated. I take Celexa and Lamictal. I understand Lamictal is a common treatment for Bipolar II, and it’s also been shown to be effective in treating treatment-resistant depression. That being said, I’m not too worried about my symptoms progressing to full mania, I’d just like to have some guidance on how vigilant I should be.",20Feb2020,1
165,"Hi guys new member here usually lurking and not posting tbh! Where to start hmm I'm a 22 year old male who has suffered from depression ever since I graduated from high school. Im diagnosed bipolar 1 although lately I do no agree with the diagnosis Let's talk about my drug use I guess. I've been smoking flower since the age of 13. I've basically experimented with every drug except heroin and crack I've done drugs cut with meth a couple times. At this moment in time I do adderall regularly and smoke weed maybe 2. Or 3 times a week. In the summer of 2015 I took acid by myself and hung out with my friend then made the stupid decision to drive somewhere. On the road I started freaking out and eventually the cops were called. I then had a massive seizure and apparently It took 8 people to restrain me I was on life support and in the hospital for two weeks. I was on lithium at the time and did not do my research. I took a year off after graduating hs. Fast forward a year I'm in school at DePaul in Chicago I decided to trip CID again at a concert. Thinking I was safe cause I had not been on lithium for like 6 months at that point the same dam thing happened. At the end of the semester I needed to come home because I was suicidal at that point. A broken heart, 2 weeks in the hospital and getting jumped and stabbed in the head all within that short semester took a toll on me. Those experiences fucked me up and continue to fuck me up. For the past few years I've been in and out of the local community college here in Pittsburgh. I can never just the do work. I developed a gambling problem like 5 months ago and went to rehab for it( technically it was for weed). I got out of rehab like 2 months ago and I had an incredibly hard time readjusting. I'm still madly in love with my ex who I haven't dated In two years, we talk occasionally (mainly when her and her bf are having problems) I hate that I still love her. I hate that i still think about her constantly. I've been with several women since trying to fill the void she left in me and nothing has worked. I know though that even if we got back together it wouldn't be the same. Yet I still lament on the times we were together, it's pretty fucking sad. I sleep alot to cope. I'm not working rn as well. I have no motivation at all to find a job. I have no hope for myself whatsoever. I've given up on taking care of myself. I'm not living life at this point I'm merely existing. Life doesn't seem real at this point. I go through the motions but I'm not really experiencing life whatsoever. Please guys give me some advice. I'm seeing my shrink today, hopefully he can help me out. I just want to be happy and live a productive and fulfilling life. The only thing holding me back from taking my life right now is the strain it would put on my family who I love very much even though I don't show it. Thanks if you read this whole thing and take the time to respond.",20Feb2020,1

I’ve just turned 18 (birthday was yesterday) I’m female and I was made homeless when I was 17. I spent a few weeks in homeless sheltered accommodation but was given a flat quicker than most due to mental health circumstances and letters from my psychologist. I suffer with severe social anxiety and borderline personality disorder so have days where I feel alright but equally, days where I completely crash and hit an all time low. I’ve made my flat feel homely, but I can’t stand my life. It’s one massive routine. Wake up. Feed my cat. Go to college. Come home. I recently adopted a homeless cat to make myself feel better, and although I look after it I can’t feel love towards it because I find my life so boring. I do meet friends and socialise but I never enjoy it. I feel like a middle aged woman and I’ve literally only just turned 18. Im really suicidal and don’t know how much longer I can keep this going. I’m about to crack. The only thing I take pride in is how I look but recently I’ve been letting that slip and am starting to get into debt and I’m only fucking 18. 

This is life. Starting off with a poor family, having an unfair disadvantage in life, and I’ll be growing up to have a mediocre job after graduating college and looking after cats lmaoo. How exiting",20Feb2020,2

I graduated w my bachelor's recently in psychology but have no desire to go to grad school quite yet. I have a terrible mindset where I feel like I'm letting clients down, therapists down bc such high demand for services and we are a small business and can only provide so much.

When looking for higher paying jobs in related fields that don't require a masters, it's been hard bc I feel like no matter what, I'm gonna be stuck with something I don't like. I start paying student loans soon and know my current salary will eventually be too low if I wanna move out of my parents.

175,"I’m having one of those surreal nights again. I don’t know how many of you know the type, when you just want to feel something, so all your physical senses are dialled to 11, because mentally/emotionally you are completely numb. I can see things in a whole different way that I can’t explain, and feeling textures and temperatures is far more prominent. I want to cry, I want to sob until there’s no water left in my body, but I can’t. I know the whole “I’m alive but not living” saying is cliché, but it’s terrifying when you realise to what degree it reigns true in your own life. I walk this planet each day, perform different activities, interact with friends and family, go to school, but it’s not for myself anymore. It’s not because I want to or have the will power or energy to. It’s just because I have to.

I’m alive, because I have to be. That’s all I have to say for myself.

I would say “I’m nearly 16, I should be out spending lots of time with my friends savouring it while I can having the time of my life” but it shouldn’t matter what age you are. No one should just be living because they *have* to, it’s torture. They should be living because they enjoy it and they *want* to.

I’ve been on this planet for 1 and a 1/2 decades; lots of people my age enjoy being here - but all I have left to show for myself is insomnia, a constant state of depression, these nights of sensory overload, and when I’m lucky, the odd glimmer of joy. Like, I had a surgery today, and though I was crying through the pain of the anaesthetic needle going into my foot, I couldn’t help but be relieved that I was feeling something real. I don’t want to live my life like this anymore, but no matter what I do I can’t seem to fix it.",20Feb2020,3
177,"Not sure if this is the right sub, but here goes: I was wondering if anybody had a tendency to get irrationally irritated with people (often those they spend most time with) to the point that one feels anger towards them? I'm an introvert and have found this often occurs when somebody spoils my alone time. 

I'm becoming cognizant of how unhealthy it is, from both mine and the person-I'm-irritated-by's perspective and its something I'd like to work on. 

Quick example: I'm reading my book on the sofa in the evening when my housemate - and best friend - comes home from work. He's always cheery to be home and asks me about my day, etc. but there are certain days when I will be tremendously short and rude and probably mean to him in response.

178,"Does anyone else here have any experience (directly or indirectly) with Impulse Control Disorder? I feel so uneasy here because 99.999% of the posts are Depression ... Anxiety ... Suicidal (I can at least relate to this one) ... Other things that I have no answers or comfort for the person, beyond the superficial ""I'm so sorry..."" because I can't relate in the slightest.

This really fucking sucks because I am getting discouraged and (keeping it 💯) and angry because I just don't feel...completely heard? I feel like people don't really relate to what I'm going through, though it is VERY similar to what a person who is withdrawing from drugs or alcohol goes through, but without some of those physical symptoms like nausea and extreme shaking, etc. I get horribly anxious, as I've described already in other posts, and fidgety, and quite bitchy when I can't set a fire. I did set a small and controlled fire today at the bus stop (the bus took forever to come today...gotta love public transit!), which was just a piece of tissue that I had in my pocket. There was another guy at the bus stop with me but I couldn't hold it in...I had to relieve the pressure and angst or I would have literally screamed, then thrown myself in front of a car (that would have been great a couple days ago when I WANTED to die, but for now that feeling has dulled a bit)...I couldn't stop myself. I cried as I did it (inside not outwardly) because again I was helpless to control my Animal, who has been absolutely out of control since I was released from prison. She was not too bad at first, but she has gotten stronger and wilder, especially in the past week. I can't control her. I already told my Mental Health Case Manager and she wants me to call my Probation Officer, who has a strong Mental Health education (a Masters Degree in Psychology), and let her know that I am out of control so IF something happens, she would already be informed. Ugh my Case Manager thinks I'm going to go off the rails (she was just speaking honestly) and it takes every bit of my self-control (funny, that is the song I am listening to--""Self Control"" by Laura Branigan) to keep myself from torching another Dumpster, or worse, a house.

This is long enough. Just needed to get my thoughts out. I am not suicidal as much now, as I'd said already, but I am anxious to the point of a panic attack and frustrated and angry. All it will take to send me into a panic attack is a loud noise or someone walking too close to me. Ugh. Has anyone ever experienced that?

So... Is anyone here like me and can't control their impulses or know someone like me!?

My ""therapist"" (I have her as a contact if I need to talk) just asked me why I'm not talking to her anymore. 🥺 Yeah, that wasn't awkward at all. Then she said, ""Struggling, huh?"" and I was thinking ""Wow--great observation Captain Obvious..."" but I can't tell her just how much I am struggling. It is like I'm fighting for my sanity, and my life.

180,"I over talk sometimes. I have issues with anxiety and stage phobia. It's affecting my academic performance and making me depressed. I also feel embarrassed very easily. I have nightmares of someone tricking me into sexual acts. Many times I'm a pre teen or younger. I was molested by my bus driver for months so that could be it.


I don't have friends I feel comfortable being totally honest with I guess. I have amazing friends. They're supportive and fun. Very non judgemental. But this is my last year of high school and I guess I'm aware that we're going to drift apart. So I just don't bother opening up.


I haven't even come out as bisexual although I have a feeling they already know. I've provided them with emotional support. *I just can't get over this fear*. I can't talk to my parents either. I just don't feel like it's necessary to involve them. I'm also scared of their overreaction.



Bottling up all this for years has had side effects besides depressing episodes. I'm good at writing speeches and all. I haven't delivered one in 7 years. It didn't effect me much till I was 10-11. That's when my breast was groped while I was going to my tutor's. I remember never walking through that alley again. I was in shock, never told anyone. Just went and studied like I was in a zone. When I was walking back home, I almost got myself run over. Still have a scar on my thigh where some metal stabbed my leg.



 
I just couldn't tell. Don't know why. That's when I realized what that driver had done when I was 5. I became pretty much suicidal. I remember writing up a plan: I'll finish this school year with good grades, I'll stop getting into fights, loose weight, I'll jump off my building on my 12th birthday.



Guess I never did that but as I said, I have an overtalking problem. Just don't talk to people in close to. So I told a bunch of neighbors. Neighbors told my father. My father was furious. I never followed the plan. Kept postponing. I remember even going to rooftop on my 13th. Somehow didn't do it.



It slowly left me like some phase. I felt really better when I befriended my now best friends. I got an interest in politics. Intellectual debates and watching cricket were my favourite pass times.



I've been feeling very depressed last few months. So sad and can't study for my life. It was one of the things that helped me with depression. It's one of the signs that I'm very much more depressed than usual. I want to study. I need to. I have exams from Monday. The results will decide my future. One that I haven't been able to force myself to care bout.

I was diagnosed with bipolar a few years back, and things are usually fine.   
However, I still experience these ""episodes"" or ""meltdowns"" from time to time, but I have no idea what it is, or what it is called. I don't think it's an anxiety attack, but more like a depression attack? This is what happens to me:

\- Severely depressed very suddenly  
\- Hyper-ventilating  
\- Crying so hard that I'm unable to speak   
\- Wanting to die/hurt myself etc.  
\- Collapsing on the floor, bawling. 

It's like what you see in movies when people see a loved one die. It's brutal, and it is emotionally extremely painful. 

It literally feels like someone just told me that my boyfriend is dead. It is intense and I can't see any way out other than actually dying. I want to scream and die.  Then after a while, my body gets exhausted and I usually cry myself to sleep.

189,"I’ve always had trouble at work. I’m a teacher and I’ve never really had the confidence that I was any good at my job despite test scores and evaluations. I seem to ruin every job I’ve had by complaining to coworkers who then go and tell administration. I recently was transferred to a new school position after my old principal discriminated against me on recording. He insisted it was because he was tired of my negativity so I ended up with a directive not to spread negativity. I have borderline personality disorder, pervasive depression and anxiety. I was told my disorder didn’t matter, that they weren’t expected to make any sort of accommodation that would help me in venting my frustrations or with emotional outbursts. There are several ADA accommodations I do have that have been ignored. I’m supposed to have a duty-free 30 minute lunch and they do not give me one on Friday I have back to back classes. I recently confided some colleagues about my frustrations with not getting a lunch, the large class sizes of 45 to 50 kids, a teacher’s complaint that I was having a hard time with the large class sizes and behavior management, and the fact I found out I was being transferred again at the end of the year and never had a chance to earn my spot at this new school. I shouldn’t have vented to them. I barely know them, part of my disorder makes me think friendships are closer than they are. I was called in by my principal and accused of calling a teacher a bitch several times by many people and accused of pushing a colleague when they didn’t agree with me. I absolutely did not push anyone and I never swear at school. He said that people overheard because my office is in an open area. He said he couldn’t prove it it happened but that from talking to me he didn’t believe it didn’t. He had also pulled up the directive from HR that had all of the allegations from my old principal on it so he had pretty much made up his mind against me before even talking to me I think. He wanted to place me on leave but I think HR told him to let me finish the year. He told me if I was found to have been negative or retaliate against anyone he would immediately fire me. I kind of just want to isolate myself because I do have emotional outbursts, I cry when I’m upset, uncontrollably. I’m on medicine and going to therapy but it’s a long process.

I feel bad after having these fantasies and I always go back to imagining the perfect world with her. This can be a difficult, time consuming task...as I have to imagine a perfect, but *believable* world. I can't just lay down in bed imagining some unrealistic dialogue. It needs to feel real, and this often leads me to feeling worse.

I was wondering if anybody on here knows any advice that has worked for people with BPD (or whatever what I just described might be. Does it sound like anything with a name to anyone here? Not looking for a diagnosis here, just looking for things that might help me in my conversation with a psychologist.) I need a way to cope with this, because it's making me feel miserable. This clouds my mind 24/7. I've even had a nightmare the other night. It's not like she doesn't give me good reasons to believe she likes me, but my mind requires proof like every 5 minutes.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",20Feb2020,1

194,"\*Trigger Warning\*

This is purely a cry for help and validation. I am in a more calm state right this second. Reading through the posts and commenting on this thread helped. I have been having intrusive self harm thoughts more frequently as of the last few weeks. I want to stab my forearm and bash my head into something. 2 days ago I was literally thinking that suicide might be a better alternative than showing up to work the next day. At 30 years old I am finally recognizing and accepting I may have depression or some real MI. I made a doctors appointment to evaluate. I have had a hard time accepting it because it feels like every time I try to express to someone that I feel depressed, they brush me off with ""well everyone is depressed"" or give me an attitude that makes me feel like I am playing victim. That usually makes is so much worse and I feel like, ""Who am I to have the right to feel these feelings when others have it so much worse?"" I've had panic attacks that started in junior high. I believe I have a hard time expressing myself because when I was growing up, I was always the one who was ""put together"" when everyone else was falling apart. I felt pressure to keep up that facade when I was with my family. I have always prided myself on being a strong motivated person. It's weird because I can objectively tell myself that I am a badass, but then also have that voice that says, ""you're such a piece of shit hypocrite."" I also read something that was helpful on here just a few minutes ago, [https://www.dazeddigital.com](https://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/31195/1/what-life-is-like-when-you-don-t-feel-real) I have often felt this feeling, but didn't know there was a word for it specifically.

196,"⚠️Trigger warning for suicidal ideation and self harm⚠️The last week has been hell for me. I have been very depressed for a while but I hit a low I haven't felt in a couple of years. I'm very suicidal and have been self harming daily which is something I haven't done in several years.
  I've reached out to a friend and my mom last week after almost attempting twice. My mom doesn't know I've attempted or that I have been self harming but my friend does cause she's been the one I've called. I came to the conclusion that I need to get help by getting back on meds and checking myself into a hospital because I don't feel safe. Every day has been a struggle for me and I haven't felt genuine happiness or a will to live. i really don't want to go to inpatient at this point but I know I need to be in a place where I can be safe. I have to spend a majority of the day sleeping or pacing around and getting rid of things I can use to kill myself so I don't but I'm getting so sick of that.  I don't have health insurance but my county has a program where you can be provided services like meds, therapy and hospitalization with little to no cost. I'm an adult but, I'm currently unemployed and unable to drive. So, I'm relying on my mom to get me there because I live in a rural area. It just seems like she doesn't care because I told her last week and I'm still sitting here losing it and it's frustrating and it only makes me feel shittier. I'm trying to hold on but it feels like I'm on the verge of breaking. I'm just upset at the moment because I wish I hadn't told anyone and that I'd already be dead because it seems like no one cares.

197,"Hi all, I (24F) started going to therapy last year around August to finally talk to someone about all that I feel and why. Since I was a teenager I kinda had an inkling that something was wrong with me. Well long story short I was diagnosed with anxiety &amp; depression. Now almost 8 months later I feel good, but I never actually feel “great.” I have just as many good days as I have bad ones. So I’m wondering for those of you who have been treated for years, does it ever really go away or is it just a matter of managing it? Sorry if this is a silly question, but this is all still new to me mainly because of the fact that my family doesn’t believe in either so after years of suppressing I’m learning more about it everyday.

205,"This is my first reddit post so sorry for mistakes.

So imma give you a backstory so you could better understand what I'm going through. This briefly mentions a few sensitive topics (alcohol, mental health and attachment issues) but I'm not gonna make it graphic or anything. Skip a few paragraphs down if you don't wanna read the backstory and also I'm not in any danger as I now live at my dad's. 

So I was a happy kid, all my worries were as a kid was convincing my mom to buy me the next DS game to begging for a hamster. So pretty much what every average kid worries about. I always had loads of friends and I was always good and doing well in school despite of few issues at home.

However, this all changed as I got older (about 8 or 9 years old) my parents spilt up. To be honest I don't remember it being that impactful on me because as a kid I didn't really know what they meant. At first I handled it okay, but I started to be a little more sad than usual. Nothing serious but just the equivalent of me not getting a chocolate bar from the shop kinda sad. So I got referred to my primary school counsellor (obviously they couldn't really do much because I was only 9 turning 10 at this point and I was still in primary school.) and being honest I think it kinda helped.

Ever since I was young I've always had attachment issues, but as a kid it was pretty normal as most children were attached to their parents. But as I got older it didn't really seem to go away. Looking back though I can definitely see why.

My mom was and still is an alcoholic who refuses to admit she's wrong. As a child I was always sent up to my room when we had guests over and I was always 'protected' by her in a sense that meant I knew barely anything about the outside world. Growing up I was only taught the minimum basic needs (washing, bathing and manners) but I was never taught how to cook food or anything that was considered 'dangerous' in her books and whenever I would try to explore new things she would tell me they're dangerous and that I don't need them In my life. And still til this day I still don't know a few things. (yes I now  know how to take care of my needs if you were wondering) my mom's always believed that she knows what's best for me, even though it was clearly not. My mom's always been manipulative and has always made out to me that I'm a liar, b**ch you name it, she's said it. She would also use me as a way to get to my dad. She would constantly withhold me from seeing my dad and she would fill my head up with so many lies about him because of her jealously, she even gave me graphic details about his supposed 'affair' when I was 11 and as a child it didn't make me think highly of my dad. 

Every child no matter what age or gender needs their parents. Sure they will be able to grow to live without them but it takes a long time to do that. As I said before, as I got older my attachment never seemed to go away. I was attached to my mom despite her being an abusive alcoholic and I still love her. But my mom's emotionally abused me since she split up from my dad, through name calling, screaming and raging at me, punishing me with extreme punishments even though I did absolutely nothing, isolating me from the outside world and she's also physically abused me in the past. Which still scares me to this day. 

When you have an extreme attachment to someone your whole life revolves around them whether you like it or not. Every good interaction with that person makes you feel like you're on top of the world but every negative interaction makes you feel so low its unexplainable. The emotional pain truly turns into physical pain. As a kid my mom neglected me emotionally and I only saw my dad for 2 days a week and sometimes even less than that so I'm still getting there with my dad relationship and trust wise. 


 So I've always had that empty hole that's never been fulfilled. This is where I started to get extremely attached to the point where it was unhealthy. Specifically to one of my teachers. This teacher is honestly the nicest, positive teacher I've ever come across. She's always been welcoming and made me feel really happy with myself. She made me see that I am worth it and for a little while, I guess I could say I believed it. But once I'm attached I can't let go. I constantly re-think the whole conversation we had on the day and I always find something that I said wrong or something that I should've said. It's so hard because I think she's starting to catch onto it and I genuinely think she's weirded out by it. And I can't help but cry over it. Because my attachment is so extreme I can't even handle the fact that'll I'll be leaving school in a few years and that I'll never see her again. The pain is so painful it feels like a storm inside me. Getting stronger and more intense the more I think about it. Being honest I genuinely don't wanna be attached to her because if I had a student attached to me I would be slightly uncomfortable, so I see my side and hers. I have told her pretty much everything (apart from some of the extreme things that i haven't told anyone) and I cannot thank her enough for being there for me and listening. All she's ever been is nice to me, but my sensitive self always thinks that she hates me because of one of her actions, tone of voice or even the time when she told me that it's her work time. I get it. I honestly do. I understand it so much, I get that seeing me all the time is exhausting but I feel like I have no one left in a sense. I only wanna talk to her about my problems but then again she has her own problems like I have mine. Obviously. I just wish I could tell her how i truly feel, without her being weirded out or pushing me away. (pushing me away and neglecting me is honestly the worst pain for me so my mind constantly thinks about the past and makes up things that 'are gonna happen In the future' When they're obviously not going to.) 

I also get loads of nightmares about my mom and this teacher. The ones about my teacher mainly are about her neglecting me and telling me she doesn't wanna talk to me. Which hasn't happened but I still think now that it's going to. Even though she's the nicest person. 

Does anyone have any advice? It would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",20Feb2020,1
206,"My story

I am young mid teens and I started DRDP after trying weed. Something that I was peer pressured to do by my own cousins. I hated it and remember vividly going into the high feelings horrible. Horrible as a person because I am this straight A student who is religious and never likes going against their parents. (Keep in mind my parents are great, they dont force me to be perfect but I have high standard for myself). At first it was so hard. It started 2019 summer after experiencing 2 traumas. And since my parents dont really know much about mental health they said it would leave. But they did not and they decided to take me to city for a vacation to clear my head. (Horrible moment of my life: DR like crazy). And as I kept going I struggled and struggled. Went through another trauma a few months later and the feelings while were consistently lessening it surely didnt help. 

My experience is a bit weird. I liked to think a lot before DR and after the high which I regret to this day and weighs a burden I noticed the patterns yet I struggle to see the process. For me I wake up very good. Very normal ready to start my day no DRDP symptoms. However as the day goes on it becomes to worsen and worsen. By the end of the day I feel so tired and frustrated. And the cycle repeats. My thoughts are strange I sometimes just forget i am a human with limbs and can do stuff. I forget the people around me and question if they are real. When I 100% know they are and that I am fine. My mind most of the time is blank when no one is talking to me. And its so annoying That i never feel like agile and have fast reaction time. I dont know what to do. I am hopeful and look forward to getting physically healthier. But I dont know what to keep doing. I read stories of people who have been like this for their lives and unlike most I want to fight. I want to return to my life. So I turn to reddit. What can I do? Meditation?

For a bit of background on me I am a thirteen year old female, in Australia, who has fairly good grades so far and horrible friendships.


My father is adopted so I don’t know much about his family history. But I do know that he suffers from a hereditary mental illness that makes him easily lose his temper. I do t know what the illness is as my family refuses to tell me but I have been told several times that I show symptoms of the mental illness.


I’ve done my share of research on hereditary mental illness to attempt to determine what is wrong with me but I’m at a loss and my mom avoids taking me to a therapist and likes to say I’m faking everything for attention if I try to explain to her why I suddenly lost my temper.


I’ll explain it best I can but I’m not great at words or explanations really.
It’s like I can be fine one second and content and then suddenly I’ll think about how I dropped something this morning and then my temper just explodes. Surprisingly I’m pretty good at hiding my emotions so no one has any clue that I’m mad.



Then there are times like this. This happens more often so than the sudden anger. I’ll be talking with my friends or just doing anything then something just comes over me and I feel giddy. Then I’ll do things like insult my friends or in general just say or do things that go too far, and internally I’m completely aware of what I’m doing but it’s like I’m just watching myself with no control over what I’m saying and doing even though inside I feel completely guilty and just want myself to shut up.

Since elementary school I always had a friend group that I talked to, but usually after less than a year I meet someone and they seem really cool. I start unconsciously hanging out with them more and more and then I almost completely abandon my ""old friends"". It is not my intent and in my younger years in elementary school I did not even realize it was happening. I realized it was happening over and over again when I was 13 (I'm freshly 16 now). I wanted to do something about it and it was working out for about a year and a half, but then I got into a big fight with them and couldn't hang out with them so I decided to hang out with some other people I kind of knew and It happened again in the matter of weeks. Now I rarely talk to my old friend group and talk more with the friends I abandoned my old friend group for. I can tell I am not as happy being with them compared to when I was with my old friend group again, but I don't wanna make the same mistake again and I am afraid I am going to. Now most of my old friends realize that I abandoned them and I get a lot of shit from them like about how I abandoned them, eventually abandon everyone and that I do not care about anyone. This week two people told me pretty much that and they do not even know each other. I think it is true even though I do not want it to be but I do not know how to fix it.

Another thing is the thing about how I do not care about anything and I think that might be also true. A few months back my dad accidentally ran over our dog when he was parking. When I got home and everyone was crying and burying our dog I was kind of just there. I do not think I felt anything. I thought I cared about him a lot but him dying was not really sad for me. I just kind of accepted it and moved on with my life pretty much instantly. I think I cared about him as much as I care about my friends, but if I did would I care If I lost my friends. I've always been in the mindset that I do not need anyone else but me. In a way it made me stronger but I think maybe I Isolated myself from everyone .

I am just very confused and do not know what to do. I do not want to talk about this with anyone, because I think I might be just a big crybaby and I do not want to bother people with my stupid problems. I just wanted to get this out of me somewhere anonymously and this seemed just like the right place.

213,"Hello! I live in the US and I’m seeking advice for a family situation that’s come to light. I have PTSD from an incident with my older cousin who lives in Spain and a month ago (after some incriminating sexual comments at a family reunion) we decided to tell my extended family too. We’ve had trouble convincing some family members of him and it occurred to me that some of his traits fit the profile of a psychopath. However looking online, I can’t quite figure out if he is a psychopath or sociopath.

He is a very sexually promiscuous guy age 20. Most of his conversations are about sex and if not they lead to the topic. He is obsessed with his looks (to what degree I don’t know). He lies constantly and when he can’t get away with flat out lying then he is augmenting the story to paint himself in a better light. He carries himself intelligently but he did poorly in high school and doesn’t go to college (Everyone goes to college in my family). He works as a waiter right now. He is irresponsible and has had minor run ins in the law like vandalism or weed but I don’t think has ever been actually charged with anything. He is very charming which is what makes me think he has some of my family members fooled but there are little things that give away that it’s an act. Like he calls his girlfriend a throwaway fuckbuddy or he tells everyone his dad is a fuck up slob. 

I’m not asking for any official diagnosis but does this sound like the traits of a psychopath or a sociopath? Does this even sound like it could be either?",20Feb2020,1

For every great picture I have 50 pointless sketches that look mediocre at best and poor at worst. This is causing me to feel like my only talent isn't worth it,and it's making me feel like I would be better off dying...I'm having so many self worth issues and my art,something I've always held as the one talent I have is coming back to the source of these thoughts.

I hate them so much and now they're acting all sweet, like nothing happened and they've always been there for me.

But they weren't. 

Wanna say to them ""if you wanna do something, then fuck off"" and I'll probably snap and say it

Also, my grandmother knows about it as my mother told her. She didn't tell me that directly, but she called me, while we don't speak to each other as she told my sister to drop out of school and take care of pigs. And she had audacity to scold me while I was venting to her about my parents.

She asked me to come and I stupidly agreed

And when she knows, everyone knows, seriously

This weekend gonna be crazy and I don't think I'll get trough.


Either I'll kill myself or I'll wait 4 more years to run away

Guess what's on my mind



I need to learn to tell people to fuck off, no matter who they are. The actions speak for people and I should not give milion chances



Just fuck off

Is there a special name for someone who makes themself puke and then drinks wine to cover the taste? 

You know how you can take a couple shots sitting down and not feel the effects so much until you stand up? That’s how bloating works sometimes too

Washes over you
Like a wave
Knocks you from your feet
Gets you to your knees
Leaves you begging Please
Go away, don’t let my belly swell
Compress my outer shell

Stop

Where is this coming from
The root of the feeling
Won’t eat enough during the day and binge after everyone’s in bed
Why this time
Panic on Monday?
But why even did that happen
Feel out of control? 
Just hate my job?

Feel out of control because I hate my job and can’t leave it 

Feel out of control because (husbands) family is moving here? 
But I want them to move here, I’m excited for it

Feel out of control because 
Why

Do I even feel out of control? 
Is it something else?
Could it be just the having my weight measured last month
Has it been silently eating at me
Chipping away my resolve
My confidence that I’ve evolved 

What do I do now

Money’s the issue 
Counseling but can’t

Exercise is the affordablesooution
Can I do it

Why 
 
Can I force myself to get over it

I have to 
A) Get over
B) Face it with counseling 
C) Face it with exercise and eating at meal times
D) pretend nothings wrong",20Feb2020,1

However, I hear about people who are depressed and are working so hard to get out of it and are stuck. I feel as though I should not be happy when so many people are struggling.

219,"To keep it as short as I can, and to give the best insight based on substance misuse, suppressed feelings, and a traumatic event... I will go event by event pretty much that explains these thoughts and fearful almost beliefs (as I can come to reality with my anxiety getting the best of me most of the time, which I remind myself of frequently).

I grew up in a well environment. The traumatic experience I’ve endured, is the loss of my younger brother, whilst I was in elementary school years. He was diagnosed with cancer as I was in 1st grade, and passed away when I was in 5th grade. I had believed and held firmly in hopes that he was going to live. My parents then had my younger sisters and I into counseling to then prepare us for his invulnerable death. 

The PTSD I suffer from this is catastrophic thoughts. I suffer from fearing the worst in many situations. For example, as I grew up, I would be so worried at medical appointments, especially the typical check up. I feared and worried heavily on whether they had checked my body, heart, lungs or blood pressure, that something was going to be wrong. 

When I say “wrong” I meant that something was going to come up as something fatal or serious. Although clearly that is a realistic thought, but very unlikely given I never had experienced any symptoms or abnormal issues prior to the visits.

- This past me I am about to be describing is essential to know these thoughts stem from a person I had used to be. 

I am absolutely a much better person today. To continue, I fear as if these people know something about my past self, based on 1 sided stories or just had seen the way I have acted back at a time.  

To keep it short. In the past I was careless, rude, inconsiderate and relative like words to mostly girls in the past. 

These few girls I had always known personally. I hardly ever initiated an issue with them, however when they had started an argument with me, and initiated an always verbal issue, I most definitely pressed that issue to lengths of it being inappropriate/and unnecessary. 

I never have ever threatened a girl, told them to end their life somehow, physically harmed them or got other people to harass them either. 

I really just called them terrible names and sometimes brought in personal matters if they had done so. This type of behavior was portrayed from 8th to a little part of 10th grade, as most people knew to just not fuck with me wrong. I was never a general bully though, I guess you could say my behavior was verbal bullying to those personal to me. 

As you know, word about someone who is well known can quickly travel, especially in high school. I had been for how strong I was known to be physically in size/pound for pound and also for the rude persona I had. I was also a very likable person too. I was and still am always there for friends or people in need of talking or sometimes small favors. Though bystanders mostly never see the good in those portrayed as a bad person by their friends.

I had preferred to suppress my feelings or not talk of them throughout most of my life up until a year ago, a bit after halfway through Junior year is when I really started to talk more openly. 

This form of how I suppressed myself is probably partially, may explain these angry verbal outbursts of inconsiderate word play. I controlled my physical actions very well.

Really though I had resorted to self medication with my parents Ambien. This habit that no longer continues, had begun sometime from the summer into 8th grade, up until my accidental overdose in the very beginning of my Junior year. 

I also smoked marijuana throughout most of high school. I started using it the summer into sophomore year, and the frequency of my use had became even more as time went on. 

During the middle of Junior year. I was on the wrestling team, and when I got injured. I couldn’t participate which heavily depressed me. As it made me feel worthless, a failure, and such. I couldn’t lift weights which was also a passion of mine to. I could only deadlift. 

Due to my prolonged suppression of feelings and irrational behavior, I would literally (very sad to admit) take the bar, and deadlift to scrape the living fuck out of my shins in the school weight room. Like this was so unnecessary. I was bleed so bad, but at that time, I didn’t care. I would then sometimes walk around after that class to another, in public where people could most certainly see, with the blood still up and down my shins. I literally did this for the stupidest reasons. To scare people into avoiding any negative interaction with me, to show people not to fuck with me. Although in reality I was self mutilating myself as someone would do with cutting. In reality this was just my mental illness starting to unfold in the minds of those who knew what mental illness could look like. 

These actions had obviously spread in rumors and talk, as I would idiotically fucking show off my shin scrapes from dead lift sessions to the media (instagram story or snap story). Boy did people have reasonable concerns. 

I committed these actions too with a bad coping mechanism with suppressive feelings, and the serious misuse of marijuana where the marijuana literally altered my mind.

Needless to say, shortly after these events, I was admitted into an inpatient hospital twice within a one month span. I firmly believe that these psychotic behaviors were heavily due to the heavy marijuana misuse, and I will put a link at the end of this.

To keep it short, again. The last hospitalization had changed my meds from Cymbalta (50mg) for depression, to Venlafaxine, which then caused a manic high to low switch. Which led to a bipolar diagnosis from a psychologist, a month later. 

After the last hospitalization, I became very passive. Avoided any negative interactions. Felt ashamed, embarrassed, and full of hatred towards my past wrongdoings. I did the only thing I could, I changed for myself, my family and friends. 

I do not think I am bipolar at all at all. Before the hospitalizations, I never endured any highs, lows, mania or psychosis. I guess you could consider the small timely events that led up to the initial hospitalization can be perceived as a low. The only manic state I have ever experienced was induced from the medication that discharged me with, that I had stopped shortly after. After I stopped the medication, the high went into a very bad low with much anxiety and moderate depression. 

This manic state went down during the summer, in June of 2019. When that was the last time I touched any substance aside from nicotine. 

When I quit smoking in June, due to the depression yet again becoming major from it whilst causing anorexia. 

I had became very hostile, angry, agitative for almost 2 months, then became to my opinion of the normal I have became today. The “normal” in August 2019 when those bad emotions from the withdrawal of THC had become very minimal, up until now where I feel to be the best I had ever been. 

- Maybe I’m having catastrophic like thinking as to I may fear having a form of paranoid schizophrenia, with reasoning in this case. Is this maybe as simple as that I just need some professional help with to become more in control with these thoughts/fears?

- I wouldn’t call these fears delusional beliefs. They almost a belief, although I also have the other 1/5 of my mind knowing that I am just not even considering that this people could be from somewhere else / don’t even know me / or any other logical consideration that could be better than what I partially assume.

- As today, I proudly haven’t used any substances in almost a year. I cope very well and have a great time talking about my feelings with a good friend of mine. I also relieve stress through music, driving and the gym.

- Here is what I experience on a daily basis, as you mostly know the essential now, for where these reasons stem from to these thoughts:

- At 17 years old, about to be 18 and graduated. I struggle with these catastrophic and intuitively emotionally/or logically based thoughts daily. 

-Some days are worse than others. Really I have fears and almost beliefs that people (usually around my age and especially women) are judging me or do not like me from who I was.

- This is especially at work. I work at the local Walmart in this larger town I have always lived in. I work in the fruits and veggies area, so always around other shoppers. 

- I fear and feel as if these people around my age (again especially girls), just know me from my past somehow. I feel this way when they just see me. Walk the other direction. Sometimes I even here them talking, not exactly what they are saying. Sometimes I may here a key word and then think, are they talking about me? 

- In traffic, I feel as if the person next or across to me, may know me somehow from my past. I also have catastrophic thought that the person behind me driving may be following me. I don’t assume this, as I’m more alert to if they follow me. Sometimes I’ll turn into other streets and such, on my way home to see if they are or if I’m just too much on edge.

- As time goes on, I do talk to myself or others about how I am really just overthinking and honestly this past month these thoughts have slowly began to become less frequent lately. 

- As this month I started to realize this is all my anxiety based on reasonable thoughts, however that’s some good news.

- This is mostly in public places, obviously. I really just genuinely fear the judgement and more so a misperception of who I am today compared to who I was honestly. I have changed so much and I hate to know that some people don’t believe that. 

— Thanks for reading and for any insightful input. I also do see a therapist too as of this month.

Some background info about me: 15, sex=female, gender=male, autistic, homeschooled, the youngest of two older siblings. Right, now that we have that outta the way... one of my parents was arrested and is now RUI (released under investigation) on suspicion of CP (if you know what this is, then you know). My other parents is looking after me and one of my siblings, the other lives on their own. Sometimes we'll go back up to my arrested parents house when he's not there, just so that we get our rooms back for a bit - the problem with this is that my room was right next to his, and my mind wont stop racing with disgusting and frankly terrifying scenarios. I've slept on the floor in my siblings room every time we've gone back up. When I try going to bed in my own room I have a panic attack and a really crazy urge to SH. He was an emotionally and sometimes physically abusive parent anyway, but this is the line for me. My mother recently got me men's cologne for the first time (hence why I mentioned being trans) but as soon as I put it on, I realised it smelt like my dad and I had to breathe through it for about 10 minutes. My imagination is heavily vivid at the best of times, but holy shit... I've seen things in my head that you wouldn't think could be made up. I'll hear the daydreams too, but they're like nightmares.

However, this does not mean that I won't consider their feelings. The opposite, I'd hate to do something that would hurt someone else's feelings. If a friend would tell me they needed me at 3am, I'd be there in an instant. I just do not feel empathy for whatever thing it is that they need me for in that moment.

I have a sleep disorder called paradoxical insomnia. It's the extreme version where I never feel as if I'm sleeping and I never feel tired. My body is basically asleep while my brain is awake. I started talking to a psychiatrist about that and so far no sleep meds or antipsychotics have helped me.

I've read one or two case reports about a woman's paradoxical insomnia going away after a few ECT treatments. I asked my psychiatrist if she would consider ECT and she said that she couldn't until I tried another antidepressant first. I got prozac and I'm about a week in and I really don't want to take it. I don't feel depressed currently and I've been having anhedonia and a complete loss the ability to climax. I'm worried I have developed sexual dysfunction from or that I WILL if I continue to take it, it's called PSSD syndrome.

**Does it seem I REALLY need to be taking an SSRI? Can't I get ECT without being on one?**

Even when I would experience feelings of depression, my depression would always make me EXTREMELY tired. And on top of that I'm not feeling depressed currently. I really don't want to take an SSRI, I'd rather just get ECT all alone.

&amp;#x200B;

\****Side Note\* I know the risks of getting ECT, I've thought long and hard about this, so please don't come at me with stigma. I know that people can experience mild to severe memory loss, but you have not experienced the disorder that I have. It is awful and I am willing to risk that in ECT therapy.
