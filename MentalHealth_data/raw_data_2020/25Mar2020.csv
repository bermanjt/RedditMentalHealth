1,"Ok so a bit of backstory, I'm a 19 year old Male in california and tbh my life hasn't been the most happy or fun. I grew up privileged and have money but I never had many friends, never dated a girl, for past 5 years AWFUL mental health, depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, poor health, confidence and self esteem. I came to the realization earlier this year that if nothing changes I will DEFINITELY kill myself sooner rather than later. So I finally got off my ass and started to improve myself. Got my liscense started going to the gym and starting getting my resume ready for some part time jobs. Was also finally looking forward to actually trying to date people.Things were looking better I was finally actually feeling slight glimpses of genuine happiness. I only saw it going up from that point but..... literally in what felt like a couple days the entire world shut down. Now my school, gym, dating, finding a real hobby or passion, and possibility of applying for a job are OUTA HERE. I am already feeling bits of my depression coming back and it will only get worse from here. I feel so angry and screwed over like I am sure many people are. Finally I am fixing my life and out of nowhere a mass pandemic says FUCK YOU and stay inside for HOWEVER LONG WEEKS!?!? MONTHS!?!??! realistically Ik it's the right decision to stay inside and not do anything but this makes me feel like I should just kill myself. Things wont get better for a while and all my goals have been shut down. I don't know what to do or think.",25Mar2020,1
2,"So I am 22 year old female and I've noticed a pattern in my life. I always go through stages of being really high (without the use of drugs of course), sometimes scared because I anticipate the fall, and when I fall I fall hard. Real highs include= Being happy, healthy, going to the gym regularly, flirting with other people, having amazing friends, making amazing memories, going to college, and making a lot of money. I even had a relationship for two and a half years with who I thought was an amazing partner. She was going to school for counseling, and it seemed like she accepted me with all my antics &amp; flaws. 

Being really high comes the occasional lows. I lost my mother back in 2016 unexpectedly and really never grieved her death. When I drank a lot, these emotions would come pouring out of me like a damaged fire hydrant spewing water. Although I never meant for my partner to be my therapist, she was there for me as much as she could, but I could tell it was a bit over-bearing to her. She forced me to look at therapists in the area, in which I wasn't completely ready. Yes I was aware of my depression and PTSD and drinking problems, but it was hard for me to trust a stranger with all the issues that I've been having, even though they're professionals. 

 The start to 2019 was a relatively nice year, I went to study abroad in Florence, Italy studying Organized Crime (Mafia). Half way into my studies I learned that my brother's youngest Siberian husky died due to being ran over, and oh boy that really hurt my heart. This was the beginning of all my trials and tribulations of last year. 

A couple of months pass and my brother's other Siberian Husky, Caiden (Who was my favorite), got into a little trouble. He would frequently run away and either my brother or me were the ones to chase  him. One day he found himself in a farm land, and for fun he likes to bite a lot. He ended up nibbling a goat pretty badly, and we had to go to court for the dog to live. 

On another note, this is approximately when my ex-girlfriend and I tied the knot to actually start being a couple. We had dated for at least a year and a half beforehand. I was so happy to start a new chapter in my life, unknowing to the heart break that will eventually come. (We'll get there) 

Caiden ended up living to see another day. But a couple of months later he ended up leaving the premises again, and ended up biting a dog, and then he was court ordered to be put down. I was so heart-broken I still remember breaking down in my ex- girlfriend's arms. I was just so devastated. 

Couple of months go by and things were quite normal, I learned how to carry the baggage very well. It was my first relationship, so I did have some expectations for my ex, and we would bicker sometimes. What really bothered me though is the fact that she was struggling letting go of her ex-boyfriend. Her ex-boyfriend of 3 years had stalked her, harassed her, emotionally abused her, gas-lighted her, cheated on her, multiple times, honestly anything you can imagine except for physical abuse he did. There were times where we as friends would go out and have a bite to eat at Chili's or Friday's, and she would stay in her car arguing with this man for an hour. 

Her and her boyfriend shared a dog together, and she was emotionally attached to this dog. Meanwhile me dealing with my trauma I had to endure her and her ex trying to be friends, failing, her coming home and yelling at me and taking out her frustrations on me. I told her to block him because he was just ruining her mental state and didn't bring any positivity in her life, so why would she keep him around? 

We worked together at this wedding catering company and honestly that's where we spent most of our time together, which was great. I helped her, she helped me, we helped each other. 

She ended up being bullied at our job due to her not taking my advice. Long story short she was a server at the head-table at this wedding and this raunchy, loud mouth girl was her wine and water. She went on break and told her wine &amp; water to tend to her tables, and when she came back, her table was a mess. She asked me what to do and I told her to just confront her about it, and instead the raunchy girl ended up overhearing my ex-girlfriend talking badly about her to another co-worker.. Smooth. 

So it was a war between both the raunchy girl and my ex-girlfriend and me being not so confrontational I didn't want any part of it. They ended up having a war and my ex-girlfriend was so uncomfortable going to work she ended up talking to the GM which sided with the raunchy girl, and then my ex quit her job of seven years. This threw her into an emotional mental state that even my efforts of taking her out everywhere, buying her gifts, showing her off to the world, she was angry with me. I started to spiral because of this as well. 

Oh and her ex? Well although she wasn't arguing with me about her ex, at this point in time she was arguing with me (yelling at me) PUBLICLY about her dog and how she wants her dog back, and how she's defending her dog. I almost broke up with her at that point and honestly looking back I wish I did. 

My mental state at this point was literally 5%. In one year I lost two dogs, my young cousin to lupus, I lost the ability work with my partner, (which is where we mostly hung out.. Having the same schedule is key in a relationship) and I was still struggling with the death of my mom, and now, my girl-friend was just purely agitated with me through and through. 

I ended up pushing it to the back of my mental, until Halloween happened. My ex-partner's friends invited her to a club an hour away and I worked a full shift of my catering job. I went, and when we arrived to the house we were staying my partner was downing shots of Jameson and forcing me too.. Im not really good at shots and once we arrived to the bar I was super drunk. I kept drinking and drinking and drinking and at one point I guess I blacked out and went to the bathroom with my ex. It wasn't my most gracious moment but I threw the drink i had in my hand in her general direction. I started to break down over my mother's death and she remembers me screaming and crying and everything. The next morning I felt so ashamed and humiliated. Now my mental health was 0%. 

I tried to push this back again, she forgave me for the actions that happened that night, but she encouraged me to seek professional help, in which I did. It took me awhile to secure an appointment, but I was happy that I was going to seek help. That day that I went in was, what I thought, a turning point in my life. 

We ended up breaking up a week later. Over sex. My mental health being in the negative now, I just started to act angry, I started to act pretty much crazy. I pushed her away to the point where I told myself okay, I can go no-contact and work on myself. 

Remember that ex I was talking about for two years she never let go and let him harass her? You guessed right. Right when I left the picture, he was welcomed back. I implemented the no contact rule around January 25th of this year, and two weeks later they fucked. And now whenever I hang out with her, he calls and texts her multiple times (oh but they're still friends, yeah right). She says that he's the bottom of her list of priorities, but yet they text all the time. And he can call her whenever he wants no problem. She's told me that they've fucked multiple times, and she's happy and content cause now she has what she wanted all along. Someone to fill the empty void in her heart, and her fucking dog. 

I was just so low, to the point of being suicidal. I omitted some parts due to sensitivity, but basically again I spiraled got beaten up, got drunk and lost my phone, wallet, and jacket, and I was alone on the street. I ended up walking to my ex's house. I told my ex what happened and she minimized everything. Mental health -40%. I slept over her house and the next day she kept yelling at me telling me how she's always cleaning up my mess and that she didn't sign up to help me at all.. I was just so heart broken all over again.. I went on her laptop to use facebook to message bars on the whereabouts of my items, and to my surprise my ex was calling me crazy, mentally unstable, making fun of my appearance, and making fun of the fact that she almost invited her ex over that night.. I spiraled even more.. To think, she wants to be a counselor? 

She had the audacity to come to my house and smoke and drink on my birthday, and he calls her phone because he can do whatever he wants no punishments, like how disrespectful is that?????????

She then has the audacity to tell me that she's not done with me yet and keep the hope alive that one day we can rekindle and stupid me agreed to being friends with her because of the hope she put in my lap. Writing this just makes me so mad I can't even fucking handle it. 

I know killing yourself for over a bitch who doesn't want you isn't the answer but I just feel so attacked, so betrayed, so used, so heart-broken, and so drained. Especially now since this Corona-Virus is in full effect. Fuck my life dude I wish that I could slap the living shit out of 19 year old me and tell me to not pursue her. I was so happy with life, yes I was still grieving but I was making it work I was on the path to greatness. Never had sex before in my life, wanted to keep romance till marriage, now look at me. Crying over some bitch. 

So now my mental health is -50% because of everything that has happened 

I just wanted to vent I guess sorry for the long post I am just Stuck In A Rut",25Mar2020,1
3,"Yo, new to this subreddit but I just needed a place to talk. Late last year I got dumped by the one person who really made me feel happy with myself. Since then I’ve been trying to better myself and managed to land a job that should be starting soon. Hit a difficult spike last week when I found out my ex who I still love is now with someone else. On top of that, because of Coronavirus I’m now not allowed to move to my new job and so I’m stuck inside with nowhere to go and no one to talk to. I know this is a difficult time for everyone so I wanted to spread some love and let people know that even though it may feel like everything’s crashing down, at least there’s others out there feeling the same way.",25Mar2020,1
4,"I know not being true to your true self, personality, dreams, and desires is generally frowned upon, but i have very conflicting views with my family which I haven't disclosed to them as they wouldn't take them very well. This has resulted in me not opening up to them about anything and generally being very distant, even about regular matters for fear of slipping up. This has gone on for all my life, not being able to express myself as fully as I would have liked. I was wondering if it's okay to start conforming to their idea of a perfect person until it's actually me and let go of the things that conflict with their views. I know you may see me as weak but I need to do this in order to protect my sanity and feel free, as ironic as that sounds. Please don't tell me to follow my dreams and be myself around them, I can't. I have to conform. Please someone tell me it's okay to give up.",25Mar2020,1

6,"5 years ago I had a close best friend for like 1-2 years and I really admired him while he kinda slightly abused me and wasn't really interested in me (he is also a confirmed narcissist and on SSRIs). Since 3 years our contact started to fade. We still talk like every half of a year for some hours. We both have changed enormously. I actually don't want to have contact with him and after every conversation I find that we have become very different. While I looked up at him earlier, after every new conversation I notice that he is not superior to me and isn't interested in the same things as I am. But then after some weeks I still check his social media feeds almost daily and get a higher heart rate if he writes me a DM - only to find out afterwards in a conversation that I don't want to have anything to do with him. This cycle repeats itself.

**Its like I'm hardwired to react to him like 5 years ago when I was projecting some sort of almost godly character on him.**

I've tried so many things, for example I've been tracking my habits for weeks to not check his social media. But after 2.5 months of hard abstinence, I was at the same level as before within 2 days. I don't want anything from him, I actually kind of hate him. I have often reflected on what it could be, a underlying thing I appreciate about him, but there is nothing. It's just hardwired from the past, nothing else.

Sorry for my potentially bad english.",25Mar2020,1
7,"I just am really proud of myself today.

Yesterday, I've had one of my worst day, feeling alone and having really bad intrusive thoughts. I've had one of my worst breakdown ever. When I have those intrusive thoughts I feel like everyone is out to get me or I have no friends. This lead me to have a fight with my close friend. I said some horrible things and normally shes the one I go to during such a state. I got really mad. We both were.

Even tho I was mad after what she told me, I put aside those feelings and knew my friendship was a lot more important than my pride. I I knew she also didn't mean any of it. Today, I apologized to her. I'm proud that a found the courage to admit my wrong doings by apologizing. She also apologized to me and I feel like I mature from this experience. 

We've talked about it and we have become closer due to it.",25Mar2020,1

13,"Hello. This is my first time posting here and I'm still kinda hesitant about this. Anyways, I'm a 18F who's struggling with her mental health. I have a tendency of invalidating what I feel because I think they're fake or something like that, tho some of my old friends have been telling me that I shouldn't. It's just hard. I don't know what to do. No, I haven't been diagnosed or been to psychiatrist because my family is not really open with this kind of things. I've tried telling them more than once but it always doesn't end well— making me feel more bad about myself. These past few weeks, I think starting from the last week of February, I've noticed that I've becoming more worse. I usually vent out to the same old friends mentioned earlier, my former classmates from my senior years in high school, about this when they're available or if it's okay to them, but I can't do that right now. They're kinda busy with their life now, considering we're in college now, and I understand that. And besides, they're not obligated to do that so yep. They're the first set of friends that I actually considered as well- um friends, because ever since I entered high school, I kinda got bullied. I don't know. We got separated from each other due to our career choices, so there's that. I met a few people in my university which I now hang out with, but they're not really... I don't know. One even said that they kinda get pissed off every time I go panicky, which become more worse since I entered collge. Just like my old classmates, I know they're not also obligated to keep with me and shenanigans but I can't help but to feel hurt? Now I don't know what to do. I tried telling them about it but they just brushed it off so I never opened up to them again. I just don't know what to do or what's happening inside my brain. I want to get help so badly but I can't. I'm sorry if this is kinda inconclusive or it doesn't make any sense, I just wrote down what's going on inside my mind these past few days and I haven't been getting my sleep because of it. I don't know what to do. I feel worthless and toxic.",25Mar2020,1

I’ve never had a friendship last more than 2 years and I struggle to make friends with anyone because I’m scared if I get too close to someone they’ll use anything personal I tell them against me. I have a really hard time trusting anyone but I can’t help it. This all just ends up making me feel worse and I feel so alone.

16,"TW// homophobia, mentions of eating disorders.

I’m 17F, growing up in a pretty religious household. I feel like I should add that i’m homeschooled, and have been since I was in kindergarten. I think this has some attributes to my recent thoughts and mental health.

My parents are relatively strict, though they have a lot of trust in me as i’m the “good child”. They’ve been my entire life and they think so highly of me, i think this is why one of my biggest fears is letting them down.
I’m attracted to women. I knew this from a young age, probably around 6. I grew up “knowing” that being gay was bad, though. Their homophobia is subtle in ways that you wouldn’t first notice it, but growing up around it it’s very apparent.
My dad stops watching TV shows when gay couples come in, or closed his eyes when a commercial of a gay couple comes on. he’s very vocal, asking why they insist on rubbing it in our faces. My mother is similar, but she handles it better. She studied psychology so she’s knows they can’t help it, but she still disapproves of it.

I think my parents have had their suspicions of my sexuality for a while, because I’ve never shown interests in boys. To be fair, Im a very private person as well as I don’t know many people.
My mother asked me if I found some boy in a TV show cute, and I said no. I remember her words very clearly, “No? You never like any boys. I sure hope you don’t like girls.” I hoped I didn’t either.
My thoughts towards my sexuality have grown worse as I start to open myself up to it more, and I think the reason I still fight it so much is because I know I also like men. This realization just came on much later than me liking girls did. I think Im so closed off to this idea because of my family, because I don’t want them to be disgusted by me or throw me away for liking girls or wanting to be with one.

My mom was having a conversation with our pastors wife, talking about how one of their kids (pastor and his wife) is gay. My mom said that if one of her kids was gay, it would wreck my father. And her.

I feel suffocated when I see a pretty girl and not in a good way. When I fantasize about women I get nauseous, which is new. I dreamt about kissing one of my sisters friends, who I used to have a crush on, and woke up in the middle of the night extremely ill.
I’m beginning to hate myself, and I fear that this throwing up trick will grow into something such as an eating disorder, as it does cause me to feel better. Like the thoughts and stress are gone when I throw up. I don’t eat in public anymore, and I try to avoid it. My “friend” makes subtle comments around my parents about my sexuality and it has more than once sent me into a panic attack even though I know they didn’t catch on.

I find hope in going to college and getting away from my family, but I never want them to find out. My biggest fear is causing a future relationship damage because of this.

I’d like to point out that even as a kid, I never had an issue with two boys or two girls being together. Even if I was taught that it was against God, I never minded it. Every TV show with a gay couple, they seemed happy. I thought it couldn’t be that bad if no one was getting hurt and they loved each other. So why can’t i feel the same way about myself? Is it because my parents are going to get hurt? I feel resentment towards them, because if homophobia is really taught how come I’m fine with it, even if I grew up in an environment that was against it?
I just needed to get this off my chest. Thank you for listening.

Hopelessness, mentally facing the cold floor but looking up at the stars every night to see no sight of heaven.

27,"I’m just going to admit it: I am an alcoholic. I am wholly addicted to getting drunk. 

So for some background, I’m currently a sophomore at a well respected American university. I am currently stuck in my apartment near my school. 

I started drinking beginning of freshman year. I drank all throughout freshman year. I’d get absolutely wasted on the weekends with friends, but I would drink a solid about by myself too occasionally on weeknights. 

I did not drink at all during the summer and started again once the school year started. For the first few weeks of sophomore year, I drank often during the week, and a lot on the weekends. 

Well the problem is now because of all the quarantine measures, I’ve become extremely lonely and bored. Most of my friends have gone home, but I’m staying in my apartment. I just finished an extended spring break that was 7 days longer. During those extended 7 days, I drank 10 bottles of wine just because I was bored and it was a fun way to pass the time. This week, online classes have started and I’ve been going to class, finishing all of my work and other responsibilities, and then just drinking a bottle. 

I mean yeah I know I am addicted, but is there anything necessarily wrong with this? I plan on cutting back down to mostly weekends and the occasional weekday once school becomes normal again in the fall. 

Several of my friends have told me that I drink to much, and my liquor dealer did too actually. But I don’t see the problem. 

My gpa is 3.8+ and I’ll likely hit 3.9 after this semester, and I have been doing well in terms of career/professional development. 

So is this actually a problem if I’m doing fine in life otherwise? I know I’d be characterized as a high functioning alcoholic but I’ve never understood what’s wrong with that. If I can have all the benefits of alcohol without the downsides, then what’s the problem?

I guess the only *slight* problem I face is that I occasionally do feel really compelled to intake alcohol, hence I said “addicted,” but it’s really not that bad. 

Any advice is appreciated. 

Thank You.",25Mar2020,1
28,"I mean I might have Corona because I'm coughing, but I'm just so tired because living is so overwhelming, but she thinks I'm tired because of Corona. It's like I'm suffocating, im too much of a pussy to tell her I need help so I just keep repeating that I dont have Corona but she asks more and more if I do. The sadness hurts so much. I can feel my pulse, every beat gets louder. Everything feels slower down, I physically feel like I'm sinking or being sucked up by something. I could barely get out of bed, I got up to eat and I had to pretend everything was okay. When I'm distracted I feel my cuts again or I'm reminded of my crush who hasnt responded to me in a week and it all comes back. I cant watch Netflix, I cant look at memes, I cant watch YouTube, I cant enjoy anything because nothing can distract me long enough.",25Mar2020,1
29,"I am 15m and I have felt nothing but despair and sadness for the past few years, I was going through my first year of highschool before this quarantine stuff happened and I cant Express how much highschool just exacerbated my feelings, I feel as though I cant do anything to change or help the world around me. I am part of the speech and debate team at my school so I read the news often and keep up with world events and the more i see happening the more I feel as though the earth and the people on it are just on a downward spiral and because I genuinely care about all of the people and animals on earth, it fills me with absolute dread and despair that I cant do anything to stop it, it feels as though with every passing day I lose more and more hope for the future as I have very big aspirations to help the world around me but it terrorizes me to no end that I might not live long enough to help people, seeing the terrible things going on around me like Homophobia and racism and how people just refuse to accept eachother hurts so much and it hurts so much more knowing I cant do anything about it. I just cant shake the feeling of absolute dread and pain whenever I see anything terrible happening, I feel like the void is slowly eating me up as my last shred of hope for the human race is slowly being squashed as I just see the way people treat eachother and how those in power are reacting to major problems like global warming. So like I said in the title I have absolutely no hope for the future and it is eating me up inside

30,"Homophobia is taught and my worst fear is my parents disapproval.

TW// homophobia, mentions of eating disorders.

I’m 17F, growing up in a pretty religious household. I feel like I should add that i’m homeschooled, and have been since I was in kindergarten. I think this has some attributes to my recent thoughts and mental health.

My parents are relatively strict, though they have a lot of trust in me as i’m the “good child”. They’ve been my entire life and they think so highly of me, i think this is why one of my biggest fears is letting them down.
I’m attracted to women. I knew this from a young age, probably around 6. I grew up “knowing” that being gay was bad, though. Their homophobia is subtle in ways that you wouldn’t first notice it, but growing up around it it’s very apparent.
My dad stops watching TV shows when gay couples come in, or closed his eyes when a commercial of a gay couple comes on. he’s very vocal, asking why they insist on rubbing it in our faces. My mother is similar, but she handles it better. She studied psychology so she’s knows they can’t help it, but she still disapproves of it.

I’d like to point out that even as a kid, I never had an issue with two boys or two girls being together. Even if I was taught that it was against God, I never minded it. Every TV show with a gay couple, they seemed happy. I thought it couldn’t be that bad if no one was getting hurt and they loved each other. So why can’t i feel the same way about myself? Is it because my parents are going to get hurt? I feel resentment towards them, because if homophobia is really taught how come I’m fine with it, even if I grew up in an environment that was against it?

I think my parents have had their suspicions of my sexuality for a while, because I’ve never shown interests in boys. To be fair, Im a very private person as well as I don’t know many people to show interests in.
My mother asked me if I found some boy in a TV show cute, and I said no. I remember her words very clearly, “No? You never like any boys. I sure hope you don’t like girls.” I hoped I didn’t either.
My thoughts towards my sexuality have grown worse as I start to open myself up to it more, and I think the reason I still fight it so much is because I know I also like men. This realization just came on much later than me liking girls did. I think Im so closed off to this idea because of my family, because I don’t want them to be disgusted by me or throw me away for liking girls or wanting to be with one.

My mom was having a conversation with our pastors wife, talking about how one of their kids (pastor and his wife) is gay. My mom said that if one of her kids was gay, it would wreck my father. And her.

I feel suffocated when I see a pretty girl and not in a good way. When I fantasize about women I get nauseous, which is new. I dreamt about kissing one of my sisters friends, who I used to have a crush on, and woke up in the middle of the night extremely ill. This extremely new, within the last month or so. Before this it was just intense close mindedness towards myself and privacy issues. 
I’m beginning to hate myself, and I fear that this throwing up trick will grow into something such as an eating disorder, as it does cause me to feel better. Like the thoughts and stress are gone when I throw up. I don’t eat in public anymore, and I try to avoid it. My “friend” makes subtle comments around my parents about my sexuality and it has more than once sent me into a panic attack even though I know they didn’t catch on.

I find hope in going to college and getting away from my family, but I never want them to find out. My biggest fear is causing a future relationship damage and trouble because of this. I don’t want to cause a possible future girlfriend or boyfriend pain because of my issues and issues with my family. 

I just needed to get this off my chest. Thank you for listening.

31,"Whenever I do one of those dumb personality test, and even the more serious psychological ones, for most of the questions I could see myself putting any of the options as an answer. Whether it's like do you talk a lot or so you talk very little or of you are a nervous person or a hold person I feel that either and neither could describe me. Which makes it really hard to know if I have any disorders or anything because I can imagine myself as having the symptoms and I can imagine myself having none of them too. I've been diagnosed with depression and adhd-pi and I have meds for them, but when I go for a yearly doctor appointment and they ask me if I feel that my meds are working, I just say yes because it's easier, and I don't actually know if they are doing anything to me at all. It could be making me feel better, it could be doing nothing at all. I can't tell, I'm not paying close enough attention to how they affect me, I don't know. It's like if I went to the doctor and they started asking me what the economic situation of Luxembourg is. I just have no idea, I haven't been looking into it. My emotional state and my existence as a self are not subjects that I know a lot about. Just some vague ideas and guesses that I hope are right.",25Mar2020,1

YOURE NOT HAVING A PANIC ATTACK, GO TO YOUR ROOM!!"" and I immediately realized it all was my fault.

34,"I have, in the past, had a habit of self-destructing when things were going well. Looking for issues where there are none, creating conflicts to try to get information. Etc etc etc. Now the issue is I have a really great boyfriend and things have been really great for over 3 years with no issues. My ex was abusive so this has been a wonderful change of pace. We don’t fight, he doesn’t gaslight me when I’m upset, he is wonderfully patient with my anxiety and depression. He is loving, respectful, and has taken my son as his own. He doesn’t do anything sketchy, he doesn’t “work late” or spend excessive time out if the house. His phone is always available, be put my fingerprint in so I can unlock it. I have all his passwords and log in info. He hides nothing from me. The last couple weeks my anxiety has been higher than usual because of the current events in the world. Maybe that’s the real cause. But for whatever reason, I’ve had a weird feeling that something is going on. I’m looking for evidence that is just not there. Nothing has changed, I am 99.99999% sure there is nothing going on. But I cannot get rid of this feeling.",25Mar2020,1

I won’t lie, my meds have been spotty lately. I’m running low and my medical card is giving me the run around so I’m stretching them out as best as I can. 


I still feel vaguely normal, but the sense of absolute dread set in a couple nights ago.... like I had a total meltdown. Despite the MDDand the others, I’m super extroverted, and I NEED people. My job is suspended till further notice, I can’t work from home or leave really. Not to mention the CV19 panic in general. I’m not one to normally freak out about these things but I can’t help it. 


I feel like missing a day of 2 meds every other day for a week on it’s own wouldn’t send me spiraling into the depression I felt before I started taking them. It feels like a weird seasonal depression of sorts. 


Am I crazy? Feel free to let me know if this doesn’t fit here.

vomited and kept repeating myself and like idk she was awesome and generally is an amazing professor but it made me feel weird afterwards that i told her and i was looking forward to the class where we talk about ED’s bc i almost wanted to like “redeem” myself from my awkwardness and just be confident and be able to express myself and my thoughts more clearly and also provide the class with more insight into ED’s bc the textbook does a terrible job (btw almost any ED section in any textbook ive ever read does a really shitty job at actually teaching people what ED’s are really about and in my opinion, i think textbook descriptions and paragraphs can sometimes even play into/reinforce stereotypes but that’s a whole other issue). so yeah idk basically im just ranting bc im sad that we wont be able to have that discussion and i hate how the textbook describes and talks about ED’s and i just wanna educate ppl and talk about them on a less superficial/stereotypical level and i also now feel this weird like unfinished/awkward end to the relationship with my professor and her knowing about my ED but me not really being able to have the rest of the semester to kinda have things seem normal again idk",25Mar2020,1

41,"I don't really do things like this but I don't know what to do anymore. My moms boyfriend is in a veteran motorcycle club and in this club there is an ""Ole Lady"" who hired my girlfriend on to work at her coffee shop. Obviously I was happy for her she had never really had an actual job before and she was in an environment where she could be comfortable and not have to worry about people making her too anxious. I was all for it until one day I was told I wasn't allowed to come up to the coffee shop or this specific persons house. I was confused and a little aggravated as I literally helped renovate the building she made into a coffee shop for FREE just because I liked them. Eventually I find out later from the actual building owner that I was allowed up there and that everything she had said was pretty much bullshit. So I go up there. She doesnt say anything to me until I say hi and I got an awkward hello back and that was it yet everyone else who was with me got hugs and kisses and all that. I've found out recently on 3 different occasions that she has been saying shady things to my girlfriend amongst the lines of ""You should get you a man in the club"" and other things that pretty much hint that I'm a shitty person. I have never done anything to her to deserve this treatment. I know that she's not cheating on me but I respected this ""Ole Lady"" and bent over backwards to help with anything and now shes trying to turn my own girlfriend against me.

43,"All I want right now are suggestions for how I can mitigate my problems until I can get professional help. I have extremely rapid mood swings, going from feeling numb to pure rage and ready to hurt someone, or from being really depressed to being excited and euphoric. I haven’t observed anything external that seems to cause it, these swings seem to just happen out of nowhere. It is because of these swings that I feel anxious and paranoid so often. My anxiety makes me really sick and have severe pains in my chest. My paranoia often leads me to believing that imaginary people are out to hurt me in some way. It also affects how much I trust real people. When I have this paranoia, I often have thoughts that don’t seem to come directly from me, as if another entity exists within my body, the thoughts are mostly just negative statements, either about myself or about what may happen to me in terms of who or what is after me. I dissociate often as well, sometimes it gets bad enough to where I actually cannot make the distinction between what’s reality and what isn’t.

I usually just spend these phases sitting in bed or at the kitchen table trying to do school work alone. 

This happens every now and then, but I don’t always feel like this. I’ll go a month feeling great and super excited about everything I do and then for the next few weeks just feel super empty and kind bored?

46,Hi I’m new to this subreddit but I am really confused and looking for answers. This all started about a month ago when I was completing an IP for my class that I fail. My mother every 2-3 days would call my teacher or tell me to get a note from him to check my progress. She began to get on my case more which wasn’t a new thing because she would do this randomly every year at school and at points harass teachers for not constantly updating her on what seems to be my every move. At some moments it got to the point where she would lie about my teachers emailing and calling to try to get me to confess to doing wrong. Sorry back to the point. So one day I was in class and this day was especially bad because she didn’t want a note but for me to call her with my teacher. She wanted a “plan” for how I will make up my grade but when I told her my original plan about how the IP was the plan I got a beating. That day the time hit 2:09 I remember the next 25 minutes vividly. 2:09 my ears start to get warm which only continued from then on 2:15 my ears are burning to the point I am starting to get worried as the area around my ears are heating up to. 2:20 my whole head is burning and I feel like my heart is going to beat out of my chest. 2:23 I start silently crying and get out of the class to get water. 2:25 the clock seems to slow down taking almost twice as long to go by. 2:27 my breathing starts to quicken and I feel like I am loosing air and can barely breath 2:30 I get back to class and ask the teacher to call my mom and he does after I explain the situation. He then says that he will be there in the mornings and that that will be what he tells my mom and he will have it open if I need. I was able to catch my bus and calm down but I still get a more minor version of that whenever my mom needs anything from my teachers. I don’t know what is going on and I really need some help.

51,"I’m 24, and while grade school was pretty bad, everything has really been worse ever since. Just isolation, which started from a severe fear of driving and living in a rural area, with parents who refused to drive me into town. I got over most of the fear of driving more recently (and have been in a much more urban area), but still haven’t gotten my full unrestricted license, and honestly don’t really WANT to drive.

I have convenient access to Uber and Lyft, but that gets expensive and it gets old having to wait for the driver to arrive, and you never know who you're getting in a car with. And where I live, it's still considered the norm to drive, it's not a metropolis, there's a bus system, but it only drives from here to downtown, not throughout the area.

I am very insecure about this, and it has led to further self-isolation, and for a few years, the threat of parents moving away again, forcing me to either choose going back into physical isolation, or ending up homeless in civilization. They recently BOUGHT a house in the area, so it's very unlikely they would choose to move anytime soon, maybe in 5 years, which I think is ridiculous when you choose BUYING over renting.

I'm also sick of not being able to fully make my own choices. I don't even try to make friends, and getting a girlfriend or just getting laid, I don't dare even try and make a fool out of myself, my family would make it so much worse, and what girlfriend does not expect to meet your family (and vice versa). One of my fantasies for the longest time was to move far away to a major city (New York, Chicago, Seattle, Philadelphia, Portland, etc.) and have my own life, and not have my family involved (I know that sounds awful, I don't mean to cutoff completely, but, get a good amount of distance, yeah).

I do not have good social skills. I'm unsure if it's from brain altering from years of medication, the years of physical isolation, the years of bullying in school (and was that due to being different due to medication altering my mind?), the way my family has treated me, or a combination.

I recently learned how much SSRIs can change your personality, neurology, and other things in your body that are unknown, but obvious that SOMETHING as changed.

I'm a virgin, never even had a girlfriend, but I was SEVERELY looking forward to trying to get into that at some point, hopefully before I enter my 30s....

But I suffer from these goddamn side effects, and a recently added medication being temporarily doubled in dosed awoken me, and led me down the rabbit hole of PSSD (Post SSRI Sexual Dysfunction), and other nonsexual effects that can be long-term, even potentially lifelong in some people. Losing sexual ability is terrible on it's own, but it can get so much worse, losing the ability to experience ANY KIND OF PLEASURE, impaired cognitive thinking, lack of empathy, loss of emotions, and I already experience extents of all of these things, I fear withdrawing from my medications (even if I can do a super slow taper) will increase my symptoms and cement them in, and even going back on the meds would not fix them. You can even lose the ability for your brain to react to ANYTHING, which would also mean that I could never try psychedelics, and I really wanted to try that one day, it's one of my top bucket list activities besides sex and love. I definitely can't trip while on SSRIs.

But more importantly, I could lose the ability to experience, and/or enjoy sex, before I've even had the opportunity to do so (hopefully not having to resort to paying a prostitute). Even be unable to jerk myself off.

I already have orgasms that are pretty underwhelming.

I've been taking Oxcarbazepine (aka Trileptal) 600 MG twice a day, and Sertraline (aka Zoloft) 200 MG once a day for at least 10 years, starting when I was 14, before I could even go through puberty (which I already started later than most) and I suspect this has something to do with it, as well as having a high pitched voice as a 24 year old male.

I was recently put on Bupropion SR (aka Wellbutrin) 100 MG once a day for my rage outbursts that were without a doubt most likely going to get me in prison eventually, and this actually took care of it, I haven't had an outburst since, my anger is severely suppressed, and in regards to that, I am very relieved and satisfied. It wasn't just getting mad, I literally couldn't control it, I'd yell at the top of my lungs and threaten to kill, and my body would physically shake, my voice got really rough, it was like some psychopathic murderous demon possessed me (I've had episodes more like that, just fear but not anger, but that seemed to be related to another medication I took before I was put on the ones I'm on now).

I remember when the rage outbursts started, it was literally overnight, after a series of vivid and disturbing dreams, but Bupropion SR put a lid on my rage.

My doctor got trigger happy and doubled my dosage (telling me to take 2 a day) just because I answered yes to ""Are you still experiencing any anger, anxiety, or depression?"" Of course I am, I'm a fucking human being, aren't I? I sure don't feel like one, though, like maybe my human DNA was even literally altered by these fucking drugs.

After experiencing anxiety and worse sexual side effects (the first being a completely numb penis, which weirdly only lasted for one day), he told me I could cut back to one a day, and after a week or two, my libido seemed to restore, mostly (I care for the sake of meeting someone in the future). I didn't tell my doctor about the sexual side effects, just the anxiety.

I've experienced INTENSELY STRONG ORGASMS, even once or twice after going back to 100 MG of Bupropion, but STILL not much actual pleasure from it. Like, the entire bottom half of my body violently shaking, even MOANING (as a male!) but not feeling much from the ejaculation/orgasm.

I ironically wished to lose my sexuality and emotions the day before I was effected by the doubled dose of Bupropion, and instantly regretted wishing that, for the sake of being able to be happy in the future, and at least being able to pleasure myself for now.

Antidepressants have even been shown to block the ability to feel love, I can't speak much on that, but I still feel attraction and imagine having a girlfriend, and even cuddle my pillow sometimes, and I get really emotional.

I was put on these pills for severe OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) and it did decrease the symptoms to not be completely life interfering, but that's all they do, put a band-aid over the symptoms, not actually address the root, and I haven't gone to actual therapy, not properly at least. My OCD is back up actually, not like pre-med, of course, but enough to be bothersome. But it also feels like I’m doing things at a natural pace, and just don’t know how else to. Like I’ll literally take a shower, at what feels like a natural pace to me, and find that an hour has passed when I get out (the only reason the water bill isn’t in the triple digits is probably because I only shower every 2-3 days). The CoronaVirus pandemic isn’t helping me, in fact it’s pretty much making EVERYBODY OCD.

I'm constantly reminded how in less than 2 years, the government won't even allow my parents to keep me on their health insurance, even if they wanted to keep me on. My medications are EXPENSIVE, they may be available on GoodRX (an app that somehow lets you get them for cheaper) but I still have to visit the doctor to get refills approved, and that's $100-$200 a visit, and there's not an app to discount that.

I'm afraid that I am already damaged beyond repair, like I'm literally not even human anymore. I remember being really energetic as a small child, I wonder what that kid would have been like if he was able to grow up instead of being drugged to death and replaced with the mutated experiment that I am. Maybe he would have grown up to be an extrovert with a lot of friends who could get a girlfriend, even drive, and just FUNCTION, like a normal person.

I know the brain constantly changes, but these drugs cause damage that would not naturally occur.

I feel so apathetic.

I just don't feel happy for other people, never. For as long as I can remember. I don't get any emotion, my reaction is so artificial. I uses to be able to fake it whenni was younger, but now I just can't. I can't fake anything anymore

I don't know how to phrase it right, but I'm loosing my ""love"" for other people. I used to be able to look at my mom, my brother, my best friends, and feel happy when I saw them. Now I just look at them, see them, and feel nothing. I know I should feel, but I can't. The last time I felt any emotion for how much I loved somone, was about a year and a half ago. 

I can't fall in love with people anymore. I just feel no such emotion towards people.

I feel like I unconsciously look at people as ""tools"". I only feel like I like somone when they do somthing for me (but not love). And that feeling is only for a short burst of time. I just never give, I'm always taking, taking. I know I'm doing it, I lothe myself for it, but I do it anyway. God, I hate it so much. I dont want to be the person that just uses people for self gain.

I only feel sad when I'm feeling self pity, or guilt. Never for anyone else. 

I have lost all enthusism for things I know I should be excited for. My friend is going to take me to another country for a month and a half. Who wouldn't be excited for that? I know I should be, I want to be, but I don't feel a fucking thing.

I'm the asshole friend, who makes people the butt of the joke. I can say, I can laugh at myself, but I laugh at others way too much.

It feels like all I can feel is anger, self pity, guilt, and humor. I feel like a stale peice of bread, gross and bland. An over self indulgent stale peice of bread.

I've felt this way off and on for quite some time. Maybe my whole life, its hard saying. But for a year and a half, its all ive felt. And its gotten worse in this year and a half time frame. 

I want to look at my mother, and feel love. I want to do somthing out of the kindness of my heart and feel it, not because I'll get somthing out of it, but because I care. I want to care that my friend is getting good grades. 
I don't want my mind to have to tell and want me to feel somthing as a substitute, I want to actually feel it.

59,"Throughout high school, college, and my career so far I have struggled with a presumptive attention deficit disorder. I have always been afraid to get a formal diagnosis. My method of combatance for awhile was nicotine in the form of gum, which is known to increase focus, memory, and cognitive function. I hate the dependency, waking up feeling like garbage, and the rage/depression that washes over me when I run out.

I have never been able to listen to people speak to completion. I have never been able to learn anything in a class in college or high school. I can stay ""hyper-focused"" only when there is an anxiety inducing deadline in front of me. Even then I need to pound the caffeine and nicotine, put on my noise cancelling headphones, turn phones off, and tune out the entire world.

Ok so where do I start, um soo I’m dating a girl we have been dating for like an year and couple months. We also had this issue in our relationship. She is very insecure about her body imagine and anything having to do with her appearance. She finds herself very ugly compared to people online, people we go to school with, etc.... 

I just haven’t found how to get her to see her worth and it does suck and does take a toll on any improvement on her side. She isn’t close to being ugly or anything. However she doesn’t see it.

It also gotten to the point where she feel insecure about the things she likes such as Kpop and being that quirky girl I know. When we are alone she is super quirky like singing out loud and being herself but once out in the world she holds back such as telling people her favorite band and being herself. I see like more of a serious person, she holds back a lot of happiness you can kinda see the strain. She had said that’s she doesn’t even try to think about holding back but it’s in her back of head constantly worrying about people’s thoughts on her or giving her validation. 

She has mentioned that she feel insecure about the people I’ve dated before I got with her. She feels that she isn’t as pretty as them. 

This has a lot contributed to her depression and she constantly feels this deep sadness when it comes to life or any events we have to attend together or even by herself.

Didn't know where to post this but needed to vent. It's been two weeks in isolation. I'm a very extroverted person and need lively social events to stay mentally well. This isolation spiraled into depression and anxiety, one that I hadn't felt in years. Knowing it's not my first time, I immediately got some medication to help with the anxiety. 

I'm feeling a little better now, but not knowing when this shit will end is really stressing me out. I feel so disconnected, and disconnection is very closely linked to depression for me. On top of that, I don't really have a steady job now, so nothing to fill my days with, and no opportunity to create something new as I can't really meet new people.

I read that regarding stimulation, what's too much for introverts is perfect for extroverts, and what fits introverts is way too little for extroverts. Extroverts feel starved for stimulation they require in situations where introverts would thrive.

80,"I have been spending the past few months researching Low Dose Naltrexone and have been seriously considering trying it.

From what I understand, some people suffer from depression/anxiety because they are deficient in endorphins (the feel-good chemical in your body). I read that if someone goes through a period of their life when they are under intense stress, endorphin production decreases, and it never recovers, even when that stressful time is over, you're body's endorphin production does not recover.

I find this fascinating. And it means that you have to work extra hard to keep your endorphins up, so you feel good. One important way to do this is through exercise.

Low Dose Naltrexone has been shown to increase endorphin levels by up to 300%, so it can be extremely effective in helping people whose anxiety/depression is caused by endorphin deficiencies.

According to a study by renowned researchers Norman Brown and Jaak Panskepp:

“Since LDN can upregulate endogenous opioid activity, it may also have a role in promoting stress resilience, emotional well-being, as well as amelioration of psychiatric problems such as depression. It is proposed that LDN can be used effectively as a buffer for a large variety of bodily and mental ailments through its ability to beneficially modulate both the immune system and the brain neurochemistries that regulate positive affect.” (full text can be found [here](https://vdocuments.net/ldn-for-disease-prevention-quality-of-life.html))

The LDN Book, has an entire chapter dedicated to this topic.

I highly recommend reading this [article](https://medium.com/@hablerannie/breaking-the-stigma-of-depression-with-ldn-7c5a7ba8ba0e) and checking this out through the [LDN Research Trust](https://www.ldnresearchtrust.org/video-categories/depression).

I was wondering if anyone has any advice for this situation I'm having. 
A very close friend of mine lives in the USA right now while I'm in the UK. She helped me a lot through the worst of times and I want to do the same for her but I can't be there for her due to geography. 

She's currently suffering from a combination of general anxiety (diagnosed and treated with various drugs) as well as fibromyalgia that just makes everything a little bit harder for her. 

She doesn't have much local support beyond overly expensive doctors she can barely afford and is too anxious to take steps out of her comfort zone as advised but she's growing increasingly distressed by her own inability to do so. 

I've been trying to save up for holidays for us both like the Olympics but that obviously fell through and the current pandemic is just making her even more nervous and reclusive. 

I'm honestly feeling really stuck in what to do. I'm not sure there is anything I even can do but I even considered going so far as buying a house for her to be able to move in near me. (At least when the lockdown is done. She can move to the UK but I wouldn't qualify for US residence.)

An acquaintance of mine messaged me yesterday and asked if I could pick up medication for her very immunosuppressed mother. I'd offered, after all, so I said yes and drove into town. There was a queue outside the pharmacy because they were only letting in two at a time.

I was about 2m away from some old guy - the wind was blowing pretty much from him to me, same angle. The man coughed, no sleeve or hand to cover it, and the wind blew. Because of this incident I'm really worried that guy has given me the virus. The guy had a persistent cough, I don't know if it was new or not but I'm terrified. Not touching your face doesn't do much good if someone's cough droplets land on you.

I had my MRI reports in my phone, but it had died. 

It was a traumatic, and scary experience.

This fucking feeling is just becoming too much for me to handle. I feel like I’m loosing my grip on reality.

I can’t tell if I’m angry or sad half the time. Those are literallly my only 2 emotions right now. I feel as if there’s one or two people I could vent my feelings to right now but they probably think I’m annoying.

86,I’m a diagnosed sociopath and I’ve hidden it pretty well until my oldest friend bluntly asked if I was a psychopath. I asked why he would ask that. He told me he saw nothing in my eyes and his hair stands up when I smile. I decided to test his loyalty so I told him I wasn’t a psychopath I was a sociopath knowing no one would believe him (he is a well known liar in our town) and I’m an active member in the community. He took it well he nodded his head and said it made sense and that was that. Do I tell others or do I just continue on with my life? He told me he’d keep it secret because I’ve done things for him other people wouldn’t have and he said I earned his loyalty and jokingly said as long as I don’t go crazy on him.,25Mar2020,1
87,"I was diagnosed with clinical depression 2 years ago and 7 months ago with PTSD because of abuse that happened to me (won't go into details).

Info: female, 21.

I am wondering if this trauma ill talk about now could be the cause of PTSD or is it just a bad memory and that abuse is the only reason I have PTSD?...

I was in hospital 1 year and 2 months ago for anorexia. I was still going to collage at that time and it was just really stressful to be stuck in hospital and feeling like a failure.

About 1 week into the hospitalization one kid (I couldn't tell if it was a boy or a girl) arrives to my room and the nurse says that I'll share my room with them because there is no rooms at their department. I honestly did not care at all and I just wanted to go back to college and move away. The kid looked sick, overweight, short, hair cut short in a weird way and they looked kind of scary by the way he/she talked. I can't forget the smell of sweat and dirt from them. I felt so sorry for him/her and I kind of wanted to make their day so I said that TV is all theirs. They gave me a scary sideways look and I just looked away while passing her/him the TV remote.


*I had IV fluids and heart/breathing monitors hooked up to me so I could NOT leave my room without nurses assistance*


I remember that night like it's still happening. I fell asleep around 11 PM with my headphones and music on. I wake up hearing some screams and talking while my music was going. I look and see its midnight and when I turn around to make sure I'm not crazy I see them standing at the window screaming at the who knows what. I asked her to lay down and to be honest I was a little rude but I was still in my sleep and scared so yea...I said "" what the fuck are you doing? Lay down!""  She/he looked at me and started talking about her ""baby""(?) and kept saying how she has a baby who needs her. I just said 'okay' in a concerned way and turned around and put my music on. 

I couldn't fell asleep and I kept checking her (I'll refere to them as a 'she') every once in a while. She was just sitting on her bed and stared at me. I was half a sleep and decided to turn around...when I did she was laying on floor crying and screaming ""babies,BABIES"". 


Next day I told my nurse about that while she was talking my blood out in exam room and she just said ""I don't know his situation so just push it through"" I guess they didn't inform everyone about him/her from the department...


Next night she tried to get into my bed while I was sleeping. I was a very light sleeper back then so I woke up immediately and screamed at her ""I'll call the police if you don't leave"" I have no idea why did I say that but its the first that came up to my mind then. 

She. Did. Not. Leave. and I couldn't either because I was hooked up to 2 monitors and IV. I didn't to hit her so I just kept yelling and she layed down in my bed (which was not allowed in hospitals) and wanted to put her hand around me. She smelled so bad and I pushed her off. I was discharged from the hospital the day after she went back to her department. Since that day I can't stop thinking about it. I am having mixed emotions between feeling sorry and disgusted. 

I have dreams about her just sitting there and touching me. I keep seeing her face on other people which is the reason why I have social phobia and didn't talk to anyone for past year. 9 months ago something horrible happened again and 2-3 months later I was diagnosed with PTSD because of that abuse but I never mentioned that what happened in hospital to anyone.

I keep feeling like she is here or like I am living trough this again. I can't sleep with my windows opened because I feel like she will be there and scream trough the window. Its so real. I had a dream about her last night and she was bleeding. I had to take pills to calm down. Thankfully I live alone but I don't know what could this be.",25Mar2020,1
88,"I am very prone to severe panic attacks and self harm. It goes to the point where all i see is black and i can't control my hands and all i can think of it how to cut myself. I've have a past which includes a lot of things that have made me the way i am. Abuse, grief, loss. I came out of my clinical depression over a year ago when i met my current boyfriend. And let me tell you I've never been this happy before. But due to a lot of dumb and naive things that i did in past or was still doing, him and i had a lot of ups and downs. Everytime we fought, I'd always end up having my episodes again and then cut myself and he'd always blame himself for it. It hurt me to see him that way. All these fights and attacks started because of my immature actions yet he was the one who ended up taking the blame. After a while things got better i guess. A lot better. We had our small occasional reminders of past which led to small fights but we always figured a way out of things. But because of all the fights and things I've done and how I've been, he had become a little possessive. Nothing out of hand or serious. Just small stuff which i could handle and see why he felt that way. But recently something happened, like something he said which i felt was wrong and I didn't want to accept that as ""casual possessiveness"" this time. We ended up fighting again. It was a bad one. His reasoning was he became this way because of his past and because of all the things that I had done to him (no not cheating nowhere near that but some dumb and bad stuff). I felt bad that he was still hurting from all that but i was hurt too. I didn't like the way he behaved certain times and ""all the things I've done"" should not justify or give anyone the right to do wrong too. He knew what he did or how he behaved was wrong but i guess we both were too heated to talk straight. I was having attacks already. In the end of a long text fight, he apologized. He said he's sorry for hurting me and making me feel this way, and then he said bye. We didn't text after that. It's been 3 days since we talked. That's the longest we've been away from each other since we met. Everytime i think of calling or texting him, i get reminded of what he did and everything i did and i start having attacks again. It's kind of a loop which i don't know how to come out of. So i waited and hoped he'd call. But he didn't. No sign of him. Maybe he's hurting just like i am. I'm starting to have really bad thoughts again. You know what kind. Everytime I'm in a bad state of mind, i end up this way. No matter how small the reason is. I have no friends that i can talk to except for one who's my and his only real friend. We three are like a bff circle. She knows about everything. She texted me yesterday and today. I didn't reply. I saw my boyfriend had posted a story of him on a video call with his boys. I felt bad. I don't wanna jump to conclusions here but, he can talk to them but not me. Not me. I just felt bad and i deleted the app. I couldn't bring myself to talk to my friend or anyone. Or him. I don't know if he's fine or what he's doing. But i feel worse every passing second and i don't want to end up doing something to myself again or anything worse than that. I don't know what to do. I feel alone even when i have so many people around. I just don't know what to do and i felt like venting somewhere or else i couldn't have taken it anymore. I'm sorry this is so long. I just want to ask you to not judge him or me or anyone here. This was just a summary. He is the most forgiving and loving person I've met in my sorry sad life so far. Even though we both have our differences, we love each other more than we are aware of. And i know he'll come back and everything will be ok again. I just hope the wait doesn't end up in anything bad. Sorry again for the long vent. Thank you for reading.",25Mar2020,1
89,"I’m 23 in one week. I’ve dealt with severe anxiety the past 8ish years. Among my anxiety issues include OCD tendencies (I’ve never officially been diagnosed but I FOR SURE exude  obsessive-compulsive behavior) trauma from the past, self-esteem issues, and an extreme fear of aging. Because of my constant obsessions and inability to concentrate on things, the past 8 years have been hell. At the moment I’m barely taking one online college class and working part-time. I’ve failed so many community college classes in the past because I was too stressed to go to class. I still don’t know how to drive. I wake up devastated by my thoughts every morning and barely make it through the day. Last year was when my self-esteem issues and desire to live came crumbling down- losing a lot of my thick hair (idk why that happened??) and seeing aging signs on my face have drove me mad and make me want to smash the bathroom mirror. Anyways, long rant short, I hate having to deal with life but wish me some fucking luck. Maybe once this quarantine business subsides and the world starts getting back on track, I’ll chop off my hair, study for a driver’s test, switch up my style. I need something to to bring me to the light, because whatever I got going on right now is only bringing me further into this dark hole I call my mind.

91,"Some background for a bit, I'm a 23 year old male with a history of physical and emotional and whatever else abuse during my childhood by my father. I mean only recently, like a year or two ago, I started to think of it as a serious issue and how it impacted my adulthood...now back on topic  


..I guess I already know the answer to that question, that these are unwanted thoughts but no matter how hard I try to ""escape"" them I just seem to make them come back at a later time and come back stronger than the last time. I can get lost in these thoughts for hours at a time, thinking about suicide, thinking about my past, opening up old bottled up memories and emotions, thinking about self-harm //clean for 5 days// and even if I am distracted by something else, like talking to someone or playing a video game, or watching a movie, those thoughts are still there, muffled but still there.  


I find it very hard to talk to people about what actually I am feeling and thinking, I find myself just starting to tear up and cry just at the thought of telling someone about it. I have that fear that I wont be taken seriously and that I'll just be pushed aside. I do not even understand or better yet what I am exactly feeling to be honest, its been going on for so long that i got simply used to it. Sometimes it gets harder to keep it together, sometimes its easier but its always a constant. This empty, hopeless, cold feeling in my mind, more often than not I cant even focus on my job enough to do it properly because I get distracted by these thoughts. Thoughts that no matter what I do things wont change, that no matter what I will end up old and alone, and honestly that is where I draw my suicidal thoughts from. I am afraid to be alone, to end up alone for the rest of my life, but terrified to let someone in and let someone get too close.  


I did meet someone, and I've been talking to them daily for a few months now and that person makes things a bit easier to handle since I trust them, they know it all. But that person can only help so much, we are too far apart.  
I guess the one thing that scares me the most is waking up one day and being fed u, doing something on impulse which I was close to doing many times before but never went through with it. I know I should seek professional help, but fuck me if it is not hard asking for help, I am not used to that, I always dealt with my issues on my own, even if its a really fucked up and bad uhm solution, it was my solution.

100,"It’s 7:07 AM, lights are on in my room, haven’t slept. All night I dealt with fear and anxiety. It wasn’t over the COVID-19 situation, though that is on my mind a lot; More and more lately I feel I have a paranoia-based obsessive compulsion. This morning kind of solidifies it. I couldn’t sleep. Couldn’t. Kept turning my phone’s flash on to make sure the room that I KNEW was empty, was truly empty. And again. And again. And again. Then it’s lights on permanently.

Bruised my fingers getting my sliding door’s shoddy lock to lock properly. Because oh, what if someone climbed up on my balcony? Better check. Is there someone under my bed? In my closet? In the attic entrance in my closet? In the vents? Are the cats inside? Better check.

I know it’s irrational, but I’m compelled to check. And again, and again. It’s frustrating, it’s draining. It happens at home, it happens when I’m alone. Housesitting is a nightmare alone, especially at night. It’s not as severe in the daytime, but it’s still present. I don’t hear voices or anything, but I FEEL this presence of fear. Which I personally believe is an evil getting at me (now y’all really think I’m crazy, huh,) possibly in the form of a mental illness, but I don’t know, and I don’t know if I want to know. I just want to not be afraid or anxious.

Normally I’m very conscious of when fear is settling in, and I take the necessary steps to get myself out of that state of mind. I’m proud of my ability to do so in a way, but then there are nights like these that set me back. I feel so vulnerable and paranoid and afraid. It’s as if logic and reason go out the door, and there will magically be someone or something in the room with me, because I wasn’t there watching to make sure, and I can’t rest until I know that it’s not the case. 

I know I should speak with my doctor about this, but I just don’t feel comfortable doing that yet. She and I have seen each other twice in the last couple of years. I don’t feel I can open up to this person, and I wouldn’t know what to say.",25Mar2020,1

I felt embarrassed and anxious about the smallest of things (like people looking at me or just certain words could just send me on a downwards spiral). And I just lacked empahy for others (I never would say anything but never would feel like bad for them or like I wanted to help them) like when my mother was feeling pain was just 'oh, okay' (and it still is??). I don't felt embarrassment for most things anymore and I don't feel that thick tar feeling, so is that good?

103,"Let me just start off by saying how I’ve been going to a counsellor once every few months for my self-esteem issues. While I still have pretty bad self-esteem issues, I am definitely more comfortable with where I am now than just a few years back. 

I don’t think I am depressed. While I’ve had the occasional periods of really bad sadness, I’ve never wanted to kill myself. Sure, the occasional thought of suicide do come to mind, but they are never prolonged. In fact, the reason why I went to find the school counsellor was precisely because of the occasional suicidal thoughts. While I was down most of the time, I never actually wanted to end my life.

I am in a University pursuing something I really have no passion or talent in. In fact, I absolutely hate it. I’m only in it because of my parents, and also because of the future prospects with regards to career options. My GPA is horrible but the scary thing is, I don’t care. I have zero motivation to do anything well in school. In fact, I have zero motivation to do anything at all. Even things that i enjoy(ed) doing. I’m in this vicious cycle of low motivation and I’m doing nothing productive with my life. The only time I actually do work is when I’m in a group project, or if I’m responsible for other people’s grades. I don’t care if I do badly. Just not other people.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I feel like a lot of the symptoms of depression apply to me, EXCEPT the suicide part. I don’t know if I do have anxiety, but I get panic attacks from time to time. Sometimes I get crippled when doing school work. I get socially exhausted pretty quick. Maybe I should go to my counsellor again for these issues but every time I go into his office, I am not in that depressed state of mind to say what I feel when I’m in that state. In fact I can’t really recall how it feels like to be like this when I go to see him. As a result I cannot convey to him this feeling of loss and hopelessness to him.

I have recently shifted countries and I am on the lookout for jobs in the Euro region. I am away from my family and having a lot of relationship problems with my wife. Also the work from home makes it terrible for me since I cannot go out and venture out / do any activities. I think I am mildly depressed - I have been taking tests to see whether I am actually depressed or not and the results are not that positive to be honest. I just try to keep myself as busy as I can. But with the added restrictions of not going out to do anything, it makes me sick mentally. What are you guys doing to cope that ?

111,"ive struggled with very bad body dysmorphia and eating disorder habits for years (i have been and currently am going to therapy), i also have exercise induced asthma so working out can be hard for me. everyone always says working it so beneficial on your mental health and wellbeing but when i do it, i become so obsessed with it that its all i ever think about and i never feel satisified with the workout i did. afterwards i just feel like i didint do enough and like no difference is being made. my only goal when working out is “lose fat on my stomach, hips, thighs, arms, get rid of hip dips” and the list goes on. all my friends are so petite, when im with them i think “i want to look like her, i need to workout”. i struggle to eat healthy, because i always feel like im eating too much food (i dont calorie count as my therapist advised me not to). a lot of peoples goals when working out is to better their wellbeing and have more energy etc.. mine is literally : look like *insert name* . im not overweight and im aware of that, but i hate the way my body looks. i have chunky thighs, hip dips, a pudgy belly, bat wings on my arms, back fat, a double chin. ive cancelled plans a couple times because id think “i need time to workout” and if i got a lot of homework when i was in school i would become very stressed with trying to balance time. scratch that! i cant balance time. working out just takes over my schedule, its like “if i dont workout, my whole days and week will fall apart” 

should i stop working out completely or am i maybe jumping into it too quickly? how can i ease myself into it when i have panic attacks over feeling i havent done enough? it makes me very depressed.. i also emotionally eat so when i feel like crap i binge then feel even worse.",25Mar2020,1

during quarantine/social distancing, many of us will experience anxiety, loneliness, and existential crisis (more intense than ever). this causes our mental health to become weak, which can result in us succumbing to our insecurities and self-esteem issues.

if you ever look in the mirror and feel ugly, try doing your make up. i know it’s pointless to do your make up when you’re just staying home + nobody’s going to see you, however, the purpose of this is to do it for yourself.

i can’t speak for others, but personally, when i stay home for too long (in my pjs and barefaced), i start noticing my flaws more. make-up is fun for me. it enhances my beauty, raising my self-confidence.

133,"I’m not sure myself if this vent should be here, but given that this subreddit involves perfectionism (it does have a toll on mental health after all), I’ve chosen to post it here. If it does not belong here, I sincerely apologize.

I’m 14 and an honors student, currently in 9th grade doing well (95+ overall average) and as the subject says, I’m suffering from some serious perfectionism and perhaps other mental health issues as a result (inferiority complexes, Imposter Syndrome and possibly even Depression). 

Ever since Middle school, teachers have praised me for my intelligence and how brilliant of a student I was. It felt great and I was greatly motivated throughout middle school, but I feel like that’s come back to bite me right in the butt. Ever since last month (February 2020), I’ve been feeling the opposite of what my teachers, parents and counselors said about me. Meltdowns (I happen to have High Functioning Autism) over the smallest mistakes. My first meltdown over a mistake lasted 6 hours over being wrong when correcting the teacher (Tried to correct her over the pronunciation and use of the Latin word “Deus”). Following that meltdown, I had similar experiences when I made mistakes or just couldn’t understand material fast enough. I even considered self-harm and drugs/alcohol (don’t worry, I didn’t do it and still won’t, but I remembered imagining myself smoking my problems away once).

Every mistake I made or expectation I had that wasn't met would place me into an inferiority complex riddled with paranoia and overall pessimism. I overthink as I keep asking myself: Am I good enough? Do my classmates and teachers hate me? Are they making fun of me for getting that question wrong? Will my parents abandon me? (I actually thought they would do that when I failed a World History Exam, but I can assure you that my parents are not abusive and are in fact amazing people and love me dearly. They really do) Why am I like this? Why am I so hard on myself? Will I succeed in life, making a mistake like getting a 99/100 on a quiz? (It’s happened a few times to small degrees, with scores like 90 and 95).

Then, it eventually came. Comparisons. Unhealthy comparisons, might I add. Despite being 14 and still trying to make my way into society, I’ve been comparing myself to people who have already succeeded (Oversimplification: 14 year old kid compares himself to Bill Gates). I’m aware that I’m only 14 and am not an adult just yet, but I really can’t help myself. 

I used to think that I really was brilliant, like my teachers said, but now I’m just an emotional wreck and feel like I’m behind everyone else. My mom said that I can be skilled in something, but there will always be someone better than me (I find this to be true and fair), but now I feel like everyone is better than me. I feel like all this time, I really am the worst. I feel so inadequate despite my grades and have even contemplated suicide multiple times (like self-harm and drugs/alcohol, there’s no way in heck I’m getting close to that approach).

I’m just beyond lost. I know that these mental blockades of Perfectionism will not help me when I grow up into an adult and I want to stop, but I just can’t. How can I learn to accept mistakes? How can I stop overthinking? How can I stop comparing myself to others? Just how the hell can I get myself out of this predicament?",25Mar2020,1

136,"Hi,

Please move this to the relevant subreddit if this is not it.

\---------------------------------------

Ten years ago my mum's mum died and this had a huge negative impact on her.   
Over the last ten years, her short term memory has gotten worse and worse.  
Imagine Dory from the finding Nemo film level of bad.  
She constantly losses things because she moves them around and then forgets where she puts them, then constantly stresses about not knowing where particular things are.  
Conversations from just a few minutes ago are repeated over and over and over.

The doctors say it's not dementia and is a form of MPD.  
And as is always the case, they treat the symptoms instead of the cause.  
So I checked the medication that she has to take daily (but always forgets or overdoses because she's forgot that she took it) and it's nothing but multivitamins, fish oils and anti-depressants.

Over the next three weeks she's staying with me while the UK is in lockdown due to the coronavirus.  
I want to use this time to try and improve her short term memory so that her life and everyone around her's life is much better.

Here's what I've been doing so far during the first two days she's been here:

. Made sure she's taking her ""medication"" every day.

. Give her tasks to do like helping me paint the garden fence.

. 1g of lion's mane mushroom capsule a day.

. Three 30 minutes sessions of brain training on the Nintendo switch.

. Make her do/find things instead of just doing it for her.

. One 30 minutes walk with me while I'm walking the dog.

. Consistent bed time.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything else I can do? Anything that's proven to improve her short term memory?

It's tearing my family apart and it just breaks my heart to see her struggle all the time.  
I just want my mum back.",25Mar2020,1
137,"But I thought it might help to write about this.  Obviously the world is burning down right now (obviously, right?), but I mean that's not really what's bothering me.  Yeah, I'm probably free associating.  That's just like me.  I'm going to have to spitball this until it comes out I guess.  I'm asthmatic, so that has my nerves in a bunch.  Me being a so-called ""essential"" doesn't help, but you know that's all just a backdrop.  What I mean is that because the whole world is falling in, I've given into some vices.  I hooked up with my old girlfriend.  We had a lot of fun.  The next day I had a panic attack and made her late to work.  We've been working on forming  a friendship in spite of a lot of things.  Let me back up.  We had a complicated burst of micro-relationships.  We split up around the time we would have had sex and went off with different people.  It's a blur of regret, insecurity and confusion.  I lost my virginity, if I had to phrase it that way, in a one-hour stand that cost me a valuable friendship.  But I don't like words like ""virginity.""  Anyway, hers was a scumbag rapist, I think we both agree.  Sex is complicated for me.  Like I said it makes me spiral down down far.  I group it in with loss and a lot of hurt.  She used to overshare very hurtful things about him when we inevitably got back together.  Things that cast a long shadow over my feelings of self and sexual worth, and things she's said countless times that she didn't know what she was talking about or doesn't remember well enough anyway, but I shouldn't need that.  I guess I'm typing to reframe something for myself.  I have PTSD.  See I can say that here because no one's gonna give me shit, at least I hope.  That's what I got diagnosed with when I was hospitalized.  Anyway, I worry about things like measuring up.  I fucking shouldn't.  My poor mental health holds me back sexually.  I know this because I do great when I'm tired or high or just not guarded.  I've just never been at the top of my so-called game because I'm always under a kind of nerve arrest.  I know that, I know I could be better, but also, I'm just not a very sexual person most times because of it.  And that should be okay by me.  I think what I mean is no one is sexually perfect and these swirls of insecurity are the least of my problems but they're the backbone.  I know no one is perfect sexually, and everyone has severe problems performing.  At least I know mine.  At least I know once I'm comfortable, I have the compassion to be an outstanding sexual partner.  My only problem is my nerves.  At least I know it to work on it.  Nevermind anyway, it's humiliating, but I needed to be able to walk myself to that point.  Sex is a brutal trigger for me.  Thanks for listening.

I asked my sister to take some things to the shed for me while I was sorting the paper work as she had already said she couldn’t do the paperwork. Our shed is just in our garden so it’s not far at all. She said she didn’t want to do my mum said she doesn’t have to and if I want stuff put in the shed I should do it myself.

I'm new to reddit and also new to the situation I'm facing in my life. I'm 28 years old, and got married in March of 2019. It's only been a little over a year since I've been married and I'm already considering divorce. My husband has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.

He's seeking counseling for his BPD and I am as well to figure out how to cope, but he's so rude to me every single day.

144,"I (F19) had a best friend (M18) we knew each other for 10+ years we literally were through thick and thin in high school and now we don't talk anymore because of a stupid kiss.

I was mentally in a dark place last year and when I had a mental breakdown I called him and told him I feel bad. He then got out of a party he was attending and drove to my flat at midnight because he wanted to cheer me up and stay with me.

Everything went well till we both kissed each other and made out a little. We tried to have a relationship but it felt wrong and we both decided that it's not a good idea after a couple of days of being ""together"".

Now we don't talk anymore. I miss him. I want him here with me. I miss his stupid jokes. I miss our stupid arguments. I miss everything about him but he's not here with me anymore.

We don't talk anymore to each other. I sent him a message today and told him to he safe because of the COVID-19 virus, naively thinking that he'll reply because we both got over the situation but he left me on read. Probably because he is confused or because he can't see me as only a friend anymore. I thought we can be friends despite the fact that we kissed but apparently not. I guess it is better that way but I miss him. I miss him a lot and the fact that he doesn't respond and doesn't try to keep in touch hurts.

I wish I could rewind time and undo what we did because I destroyed the best friendship I ever had. He was the only man I ever trusted in my entire life and I fucked it up. He was the only man in my life that made me feel safe. God this is a nightmare. 

I wish I could cope with it. I wish these painful memories could heal but they don't. I just hope one day I can move on like he did. I think it's best for both of us to never talk to each other again especially since he had an on and off crush on me since 6th grade. I feel so stupid and wrong for loosing a friend like him.

TRIGGER WARNING: Abuse, molestation, suicidal discussion

Dear Ex- Best friend,                  

You have taken enough years out of my life. I feel like if I never met you, I may not have suffered as much as I did. God, I know I wouldn’t have.  Twelve years you took from me. Twelve fucking years.                  We met when we both were in first grade, you were one year older than me, and a little different. I know now that you have a form of autism, never officially diagnosed, but it is obvious. So, I understand you do the things you do unknowingly, however, I do know you are smart enough to understand quite a bit of what you do. It was fun riding on the school bus with you and playing with you at recess, even if you ended up breaking my arm. We had a lot of fun together. The older we got the more I understood something was different with us. I think I had a small crush on you and thought so highly of you and I believe it was the same for you. I still like girls, but I didn’t act on that crush back then because it weirdly enough seemed wrong. I knew your crush grew to love and that you loved me for 11 years and for that I am sorry.                  

The problems first started to rise when I was 14 and got in my first relationship. You seemed to stop talking to me altogether, even when I texted first and tried to get responses out of you, I tried to do stuff with you, but you wanted nothing to do with me and I don’t know why. You got angry saying I loved my boyfriend more and that is quite obviously true, but I understand now you were jealous. For a long time, I thought it was just because you were used to just you and me and getting all my attention. You even started to hang out with a girl that was clearly a bad person. She started rumors about me sleeping around because she was mad, I was friends with her boyfriend. She lied about being raped multiple times. You were friends with her, then you weren’t because you were molested, and it hurt to see someone lie about something you went through. I hated you stopped talking to me because of her and only talked to me when she wasn’t around. I was no one’s replacement.

I understand you have a bad home life, abusive father, drug-addicted mother, and your brother. Your brother who molested you and me. That is my biggest regret not telling someone sooner and getting you help. You were homeless and beat so many times. I am so sorry about that; I must remind myself that I too was a kid, but it doesn’t stop the guilt. I feel like by the time I did try to help it was too late. You were diagnosed with so many mental health problems PTSD, depression, anxiety, bipolar, and more I can’t even remember. I remember you telling me you hurt yourself and I was just too young to understand what was going on. Even though you were older I felt like your mother and I just feel like this is too much responsibility for a 16-year-old, at the time.                

  I remember when you started dating “him” a drug-addicted delinquent with a track record a mile long and currently still on probation. I and your older sister both agree you were never the same after that. He used you for sex, I know he did, forced you to watch porn, you couldn’t eat unless it was in front of him, he wouldn’t let you come over to see me, and all the adults forcing you to go on birth control without even asking you about it. That just seems so wrong. Next thing I know you are in a mental hospital again. You asked me what I thought about him and I told you it was moving too fast and when you told me about the abusive behavior, I tried to get you to leave so many times. I know you had nowhere else to go, but god knows any other place would be better than with him. It is even weirder that your brother married that boy’s mother.                  

Speaking of your brother. I don’t think I ever told you that he hurt me too. I wonder if I should or if that will end up making you sadder. For a long time, I didn’t understand what happened to me, but I now do, and I am struggling to cope with it. I thought that it wasn’t a big deal and that I was over it and wasn’t very affected, but I was. Five years later I struggle with it. I thought of him as an older brother and I can’t imagine how it must be and feel when it really is your own brother. I am sorry he did that; you didn’t deserve that at all. He may have wounded me, but he broke you.

I am sorry if I caused more problems when I finally told an adult about the situation when you had started to put suicidal content on Facebook on a secret account, but I was scared for you and your health. This was the 3rd time you dropped out of school and I was just so worried you would hurt yourself. I remember the councilor saying there wasn’t much they could do since you were now an adult and had dropped out of school. I was scared your parents weren’t getting your medication for you again. I know you needed it, but you wouldn’t ever get it, but I also know it’s because you don’t have the mental capacity to know how to. I remember the councilor calling and your mom picking up and you blocking me right after because you have been caught and you knew it was me. I was just scared for you.                

  For six months I didn’t hear from you, six months where I couldn’t contact anyone and didn’t know if you were alive or not. I gave up hope to ever see you again, make sure you were ok. You eventually contacted me again we decided to spend the night at my house. On the way to Walmart to get stuff to make cookies, you finally said what we all knew but never addressed. You said that you loved me. I knew it everyone knew it, but we all didn’t address it because it was never spoken out loud. The crazy thing is you expected there would be a chance. A chance to leave the man I had been with since I was 14. It doesn’t help the fact that it is your cousin. I didn’t know if I should take you home or continue with the “sleepover”, but I didn’t want you to feel bad for confessing, so I tried to continue like normal. We eventually stopped talking again, but I am not sure of the reason why. I think it was when you moved two states away to live with some people you met on the internet.                

  I saw your mom and sister at Walmart a few months after that and I got to finally get in contact with you both. I know you both only contact people through social media and so I was glad to finally find a way to contact you both and so I downloaded Instagram. You were dating a 15-year-old boy when you were 19 and I still don’t know how to feel about that. You also cheated on him constantly, that poor kid. You also developed a taste for alcohol and drugs. I don’t believe you do that anymore. We decided to go eat somewhere and catch up for old time's sake. I picked you up and we went out to eat. It was the worst experience of my life, honestly. You changed so much. I remember you telling me that your dad didn’t want you to spend time with me because I was the “bad influence” when really it was you. I don’t know what you told your parents, but it wasn’t me. It was never me. I thought maybe you were over me, but the conversation where you were telling me about what you have done sexually makes me think otherwise.                

  Now you believe that you are not bisexual, but a lesbian, which is great I have no problem with it. You begin to start dating women. You met a 17-year-old girl on the internet. A girl from Canada. You are off and on with this girl so much. One moment you are in love, next the girl is talking crap to you, to back to being in love. Frankly, if someone loves you, you don’t talk bad about them. She made you feel like such crap. Recently you were back together with her and planning to move to Michigan with her and her drug-addicted mother. You never worked a day in your life, no driver’s license, and I thought that the last time you ran away to live in a different state not working out would be enough to make you not do it again. Well, once again you aren’t with her anymore. I am sad that you can’t find the one, but also relieved it happened before you tried to move to a state thousands and thousands of miles away.

Recently I have been the only one to text first and half the time you leave me on read. I feel like I am the only one trying. You seem like you want nothing to do with me and when I ask this you always say you want to be in my life, but feel like “I am too adult for you” if that’s the case why do I tell you time and time again that I want to talk to you. I do not think I want the same relationship that we used to have, but I want to be at least acquaintances. I am tired of being in the dark and trying when it seems like you don’t care. I told you to tell me if you want me to leave you alone and I will, but I need that closure I feel like I at least need that in my life. I feel like I deserve that much from you. Frankly though, as I got older, I realize how bad you are as a person. You used to grope me and constantly try to get me to undress in front of you and you only ever wanted anything to do with me if you could get something out of me, but we have been connected for over a decade. It is hard to let go of someone who you have loved and cared about for years. It doesn’t help that I am friends with your sister still. She has gotten so much better after she moved out of that house. I am also worried since you and your parents could potentially move into the same complex as me and my husband. We are technically family at this point since I married into the family. That is something all on its own.               

   I just wish the best for you, even if you didn’t feel the same about me. I love you, but you are so toxic. I wonder to myself why I do this to myself, whether it is guilt or love, I don’t know. I think I just need closure. Closure from you and what this has done to both of us. I put in the effort for nothing, in vain. Whatever happens, just know I love you and I will always worry and care for you. At this point, it comes naturally. I don’t know if this is a goodbye quite yet or not, I guess it will happen when I am emotionally ready to detach from you. None the less I wish the best for you.

160,"I don’t really consider myself some gothic edge-lord who loves wallowing in his own misery, but I do think that I am pretty morbid at times with my interests. Often, I find myself attracted to dark and disturbing pieces of media and art, not for any sort of coping mechanism, but just because I find it intriguing. For context, I am a 16 year old male. I feel like my interest in the morbid started with my love of horror. 

When I was 6-10 years old I was a fan of the *Goosebumps* books, as many kids that age were. My favorite film was *The Monster Squad*, a fun 80s adventure romp. So far nothing peculiar. Though I did watch *A Nightmare On Elm Street* when I was about 7, that was a bit much for that age.

Ages 11-13 I got into more adult things. I enjoyed zombie films, read Max Brooks’ *World War Z*, enjoyed it. In middle school I began to read Lovecraft and King, and also got into existential philosophy in the 6th grade, though I didn’t know at the time that that was what it was called, it was just when I thought too much sometimes and cried.

14-16, now I find myself attracted to morbid things. I believe life has no meaning, yet that doesn’t mean that we should die (Absurdism). I have purchased *The Conspiracy Against The Human Race* by Thomas Ligotti, a collection of essays which form an argument against life and human existence. I have 7 novels by Cormac McCarthy, an author who is famous for being disturbed and depraved in his storytelling. I find myself staring at paintings by artists with dementia and depression because I find the visualization of their pain interesting to look at. I’m subscribed to r/morbidreality, yeah.

Most recently, I have started listening to the album *Everywhere at the End of Time* by The Caretaker. It is supposed to make you feel how it feels to have dementia and have your mind slowly wither away. It is strangely beautiful.

My question is if all of my hobbies are going to harm me in the long run. I feel depressed, but it just seems that I’m bored with life. I’m just sad constantly. I finish one of these hobbies and I don’t feel sad. Just curious.",25Mar2020,1
161,"I cannot believe I’m writing this, because I seriously though I was better. Apparently not.

In the past I’ve struggled with various eating disorders, but predominantly anorexia and binge eating for different reasons. I’ve been getting so much better and honestly I’d almost forgotten that it ever used to be an issue.

Obviously with the whole coronavirus lockdown people’s daily routines are going to be dramatically changed, and that’s something I thought I could cope with as I’m relatively introverted anyway. Clearly, I’d forgotten that one short walk per day is not the same thing as three hours of dance every week, and my brain spiralled right back down into that darkness.

Being home almost 24/7 for the foreseeable future, with a ton of food and no one to help me regulate my intake (I live with my mother but she seriously doesn’t care), how am I going to stop myself drastically over- or more likely under-eating?? I’m a completely healthy weight now, and in good shape, but I know even the slightest gain will make me panic and shut down.

If anyone has any advice I would love to hear it, because right now I have no way out of this. I’m really scared, and I don’t know what to do.",25Mar2020,1
162,"I’ve had a mild anxiety disorder for about two years now, but recently it’s taken a different turn. I’ve had an eating disorder for almost 2 years as well, and have been in recovery for about 4 months. Recently every time I eat or even think about food I get physically nauseous, but I can usually ward it off and get through it. Within the past week, every time I see anything dirty such as dishes, old laundry, or anything of the sort, I’ll get physically sick and start panicking. It feels like my veins start to heat up in my arms and I start sweating and hyperventilating. The initial panic will wear off within a minute or so, but I’ll have an underlying anxiety for about 20-45min afterwards. If an entire room is dirty or if I eat a lot of food, it’s this same thing but 10x the power. I don’t know if this is just a symptom of my anxiety, or if I have a mild case of OCD. My therapists in the past have said that I have symptoms of OCD, but I was never diagnosed. Any suggestions or tips will be greatly appreciated",25Mar2020,1
163,"I'm an idiot. I thought that even if I adopted all the behaviors, intentionally made every choice, that it wouldn't *really* be disordered eating, since I was self-aware. I'm too old for it, I thought, and too fat. I didn't notice the habits had taken hold for months, it still felt new every time I finished logging calories under 500. I celebrated the realization I need to take hot showers to warm my body up, I welcomed the dizzy spells, because that meant it was working. I would sit there and cry if I accidentally ate as much as 1000 calories. It's become a fun secret: everyone just sees success. People ask me how I've lost so much, and I can finally fit in with someone besides the fat crowd. It's okay that I'm losing weight like this because I'm not *really* doing anything dangerous, just playing at it. People starve themselves to cope and control their lives, but if I'm genuinely just being vain, I guess it can't happen. Instead, it's given my entire life a new structure I didn't even know I was missing, and now I'm realizing I can't turn it off.

I got scared today. I was reorganizing my bookshelf, stood up, and felt the dizziness coming. It's nothing new, but it's been getting notably worse and more frequent. I literally stopped processing anything but the sound of my heartbeat. I started falling, so I staggered to my bed and laid there for at least a couple minutes. When I started thinking again, I started wondering if it was the fat that had caught up to me, that maybe I was having a heart attack, or if maybe I'd accidentally doubled my adderall.

I probably would've told my therapist at least partially last week, but my college shut down, and that's gone now. Weirdly enough, for the first time ever, I was feeling much better about my body because of her. That should've told me this had already grown into something else. My roommates were starting to ask things, too, about how long I was going between shopping trips or if it was okay to lose weight so fast. I won't see them for months either.

Even when I was at a 39 BMI, I had very severe vitamin deficiencies. I'm allergic to fucking everything and picky on top of that. The only difference between then and now is that I don't eat 3000 calories of cheez-its for dinner. I really feel like dogshit, but I felt awful when I was fatter too.

I would say I'm asking for advice, but I already know what I'm going to do. Any dialogue someone could start with me is something I've had a million times in my head. I've already decided this is the solution for it all-- my loneliness (nobody wants a fat girl), my insecurity, everything. Maybe I'll finally convince myself it's okay to exist, I'll stop feeling guilty for every move my body makes. I want my footsteps and the creak of my mattress to be quieter, I want to look like I can be snapped. This laces every action I do with the promise of progress. I don't feel sick when I look at myself in the mirror anymore.

I know that I'm still well before the point of no return, too. If I turned back, I could forget about this. I know I won't, though, because my before picture has become my definition of failure.",25Mar2020,1
164,"So for the past few weeks I've been feeling sick and not being able to eat. I'd eat a little bit and feel like I'm going to throw up. Everything else about me is healthy. I'm otherwise eating well, getting enough sleep and exercise. But I can't fucking eat anything. I haven't eaten in almost 3 days and I don't know what to think of it. I can drink tea and water but that's about it. Anyone know what could be going on?",25Mar2020,1
165,"So, I've got a serious question. I know the mechanics of ""putting yourself out there"" but how do you overcome the social anxiety? I'm a hopeful artist but only really perform at open mics. I went to school for music and business, so I understand the steps which need to be taken. Yet because of my schizotypal personality disorder, I constantly keep coming up to a line I can't seem to cross. Right now is the perfect time for personal growth and refinement.

So please Reddit, how do I stop being such a bitch?",25Mar2020,1
166,"I'm kinda mentally exhausted at the moment but I am going to try and keep this concise. I suffer from some pretty severe anxiety. I constantly have thoughts running through my head every day saying ""You're a bad person. You deserve death. You don't deserve anything good. No one likes you."" I almost daily feel like the world doesn't like me or wouldn't like me if they knew me. I become terrified at this thought. I tell myself over and over that I am a pretty good person and that no one is talking about you and most people wouldn't hate you but it's like this noise that just won't go away. I can barely partake in any activity without it popping up. It distracts me from almost everything in my life.   


I can't tell you exactly when this feeling started but after a bad falling out with friends a couple of years ago, my anxiety got worse. Basically I wanted to improve my life and that meant leaving some people behind, which in turn, hurt them pretty bad. I feel like since then, I've had more isolation and more introspective and now that I have some time to think, I've realized how bad I think of myself. How bad my self-esteem is and how insecure I really am.

I live alone, having lost both of my parents within the past year. I work from home and of course, during this pandemic, I can't really go out so as far human contact, that's not an option. I have some friends I talk to every day through messaging but I feel like my thinking is completely out of whack. I'll have these brief moments of clarity where it feels like everything is okay and back to normal, and then in an instant, it's all gone. I'm desperate to fix this and get back to living normally.  


I can't honestly say if any of this makes any sense but I kinda just wanted to pour everything out and see what happens.
