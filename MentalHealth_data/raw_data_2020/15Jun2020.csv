0,"is it just me

i have to confess, i have this weird wish. the wish is where every human being is gone on the planet, and its just me. in my experience, every human being ive met as hurt me, even my closest friends. especially because of corona, they started texting less and less, until it was like they forgot about me. For me, it would be so much better if everyone was gone because it's just easier that way. Nature has never hurt me and neither has animals either, in fact theyre the only reason im still here. without people, i wouldnt have to worry about envying people who actually have friends who want to hang out and text, and people who are social. There's always been something so weird about me, like i can just tell from anyone's body language their emotion. idk if it's just a thinking error or something like that. That's what my therapist said. And there was one time where I actually succeeded in getting rid of this. but then i lost myself. I didn't know how i was anymore. Please, anyone help. I'm tired of living but afraid to die. can someone explain this... i can say this pain of loneliness and depression and feeling like im so different from everyone else i wish i was just never born is just unexplainable, unimaginable pain that clings to you and won't let go. Therapy makes me lose a part of myself, and im not comfortable with that, so maybe i should just stick with this pain that apparently is now a part of me. there's people that say to be stronger because the old generation had to go through the great war and great depression i guess, but they don't understand that my war is spiritual and emotional, and im losing. i cant describe how painful it is, just please someone help. thanks for reading if u read the whole thing.",15Jun2020,2
2,Having a dad that hates you and a broken family that don’t get along and considering I’m the most hated child being 16 everyone judges me and calls me shit I feel depressed every single day of my life.

3,"Of recent I've saw some traumatic violent stuff that I can't take off my mind. This would be fine as I'm used to seeing blood and violence but this particular time hit me hard. Everytime I close my eyes I see this image I'm having terrible sweats, paranoia and every time I look in a remotely dark corner I feel afraid. This has been going on for almost a month now, is there something wrong with me? Please help Reddit I don't know what to do.",15Jun2020,1
4,"ERP is really hard. I kind of feel imprisoned. I feel trapped. They won’t let me talk to my outpatient therapist which is understandable but I really want outside insight. I feel like I’m trapped in a cage and I’m not even committed, I’m just a telehealth patient. 

I keep relapsing, and because of that I’ll likely have to stay longer. I feel trapped in a cage, stuck, unable to escape. ERP is making me feel more depressed than I ever have in my life. My obsessions feel so real that I feel there’s no way they could possibly be false even though I’ve had these same obsessions before. These past two weeks have probably been the worst in my life: depression, crying, meltdowns, sadness, all of it. I just can’t do this anymore. I wanna pull out so bad. I even feel like my relationship ships are suffering because of this. This is is just too hard for me to handle. I’m going to keep going so I can be well treated but I’m so scared that I’ll have to stay longer. I know it gets worse before it gets better but nothing is getting better yet and I’m just so sad. 

I don’t like this feeling. I hate it so much.

My HOCD just feels so real and I feel like ERP turned me gay- which was my fear. I’m having a hard time drying yet I cry so easily and I can’t let it all out. I feel like I’m calling out for help but my cries aren’t heard. I feel like I’m drowning with no one to save me. I feel like there’s no escape. I think I probably should text the crisis line, maybe they can help.

I just need some support. ERP is supposed to free me but I feel more trapped than I ever have in my life. Please help.",15Jun2020,1
5,"To give some background I'm 19m in California and have always been shy and introverted growing up. I never had many friends and never dated which led me to a suicidal depression from age 14-19.

Around February this year I decided I wanted to finally be happy, I started going to the gym and got my resume ready. And was ready to take more college classes in order to meet and make friends. As we all know around that time the lockdown began worldwide. 

I have tried my best to be positive and do my best during these forced stay at home orders. Stuff like home workouts and online class but I'm fucking sick of this. 

I want to go outside to the gym again with more equipment, I want to apply for a job, I want to go to class and learn in person. Online classes fucking blow donkey shit, I want to meet people and make friends, I want to start dating, I want to pursue more hobbies,  but this lockdown has literally stopped all of that. 

And for those saying to make friends and date online, my entire social interaction has been online my entire life I'm sick of it. I want to live my life especially when its during a time of self improvement and my youth. 

Is it selfish to want to open things up for my own benefit? Absolutely it is but you know what else is selfish? Forcing millions to stay home with 30 million unemployed unable to pay bills, forcing millions with a forced garbage online education, causing suicide, mental illness, abuse, divorce, rates to skyrocket all because of some virus which was blown out of proportion in terms of deadlines.

Both choices have massive costs but imo staying in lockdown is going to do allot more harm than good. I feel like bashing my head against a fucking wall every day this gets prolonged. I just want my life to resume so I can finally move towards being happy.

How are you all holding up? Thoughts and opinions are welcomed and appreciated.",15Jun2020,1
6,"Before I transferred into a big university, I was a a good student in my community college. Good grades etc, and I kinda got forced into transferring early by my parents. They agreed to pay for it and I tried my best. I have been depressed but it feels like things have been getting worse. I transferred in Fall of 2019. My grades were borderline passing, but once COVID hit, I felt like I could try to handle it, but my grades started suffering. I thought that maybe I'm just being lazy. I did all my work and studied but still did bad on tests. I...I think I'm too much of a failure. I want to die. My parents tried hard for me, and I let them down. My dad is the angry type and calls me a lazy piece of crap. I've been having trouble getting out of bed, and even made an attempt. I don't know. I feel like I'm running out of time. I also live in LA, so I was here when the protests and Riots happened. And now, I just feel....numb honestly. And I want everything to stop.",15Jun2020,1
8,"I am in a new city, alone, and need to find a therapist and psychiatrist. People with complex mental health history I need your advice on a couple things. (BTW I'm in America so health systems may be different if you live in a different part of the world)

1. Do I find a therapist first and wait for her to tell me to go to a psychiatrist or do I schedule that on my own? I've been getting Prozac from my old PCP but I never took it because I knew I'd be moving and wouldn't be able to take it consistently and didn't want to risk getting serotonin syndrome. I've never seen a psychiatrist before-- I don't know how it works. (BTW I know my health insurance doesn't require mental health approvals, I can seek these services on my own-- I just don't know if it makes sense for me to find my own psychiatrist.)
2. How do you tell your psychiatrist your history? I have a LONG mental health history-- do I just take the first few sessions to tell my therapist my history or disclose it in bits and pieces as we start to talk?

If it helps my previous diagnoses are: Anxiety (if you couldn't tell by my anxiously worded questions), Depression, OCD, PTSD, Anorexia (but I am not seeking mental health services for this-- I'm not ready to address it.)",15Jun2020,1
9,"This happens with anyone in a romantic context or friends, but especially with my family.

I'll be hit with this high mood where I feel like I have so much love for a person and need to spend time with them, and have long and interesting conversations with them, then I'll feel guilty, like I did something wrong (even though nothing I said or did was regrettable), and I'll either have to distance myself or start an argument with them to go back to normal.

I realize this is probably a fairly normal thing to experience, but still, I don't like how toxic this makes me and how much it ruins my day. Any advice is welcome",15Jun2020,1
11,"I’m terrible at life. I always manage to fck-up everything in the last second. I don’t think anyone likes me, and the one person that did realized her mistake very quickly.

This year, I already managed to mess up a relationship with a girl that I opened up to and told about my feelings. She told me she also likes me but right now has too many issues to deal with and is too worried about being too emotionally unavailable and messing up the concept of normal relationships for me so she decided to get over it.

I trust her 100% on this and don’t think any of this is a lie, as she’s never lied to me and wouldn’t even consider that. So, basically, I’m so trash that I can’t even get a relationship to work that both sides are interested in because I’m apparently so fragile that I can’t even get into a relationship because it might make me unable to have relationships. That basically amounts to the ultimate irony. Can’t get a relationship because I’d be unable to have relationships. Love you too, universe

Anyway, I don’t know what exactly I’m expecting from posting this but I just have to tell someone about this bullshit. I hate myself for ruining everything, especially with her as she’s the only person I’ve ever felt comfortable opening up to. She knows me better than anyone else, including the psychologist I used to have… who also never managed to make me feel like being able to open up

I’ve fallen for a lot of women over the years (none of which ever worked out in the end, of course, this is me after all), but I’ve never trusted anyone else that much and never felt worse about fucking everything up… I genuinely think this was a once in a lifetime opportunity and that I’ll never find anyone else again who’s so understanding and trustworthy

The best thing is that there was a realistic chance that it’s gonna work out, and then life throws a fkin pandemic between us. She went  back to her family on a different continent to support them as they need her help quite a lot. She quit her job in my country which was the main reason she travelled here a lot. It’s unclear when and if she’ll ever come back to my country. All of this is just pissing me off so much. It’s like I finally managed to have a normal life, I even managed to go to the gym twice a week… until this virus fckd everything. Because, you know, it’s impossible for me to be happy, so much so that there’s coincidentally the biggest pandemic since the plague just to stop me from even considering to have a chance at life

Now I’m stuck at home again, lazy, alone, demotivated, sad, you get the point

Sorry for the long and incoherent rant, I just hate everything right now",15Jun2020,3
12,"I have been doing well part time working with children for about to school years. Last school year was cut short by coronavirus and about a month before that I accidentally (anxiously/impulsively)  self-disclosed my diagnosis. At the school I work at I only have about 11 co-workers and I told my assistant supervisor because she was poking around at why I'm on disability. I know I shouldn't have told her but I felt comfortable, falsely, because I talk to this woman every other day and she was being really nice. She's always pretty nice to me. anyway, sorry... I told my assistant supervisor that I have bipolar. I didn't go into details and she didn't give me a crazy expression or anything and honestly, I think work went on as usual for the next month before Corona. Now I've had a few months to think about it, ruminate and I don't even know if I feel comfortable going back to work there. It's difficult for me to get another job though as I didn't finish college due to mental health issues and my anxiety is so bad I can't do simple things like cashier or barista. I'm totally stable now and have been for a few years except for the anxiety. What would you do? or do you try to find a new job or would you just pretend it never happened?

15,"At the beginning of quarantine I was diagnosed with depression and since then it got better, but recently it came back in full force and all I’ve been doing is sleeping and I even started smoking weed, this helped for a while but now even while high nothing seems to make me smile.

16,"I feel how my attention span is getting worse, and how I check my social media accounts all few minutes. It is getting ridiculous, and at this point it is a habit, that I do almost automatically

Even worse, I am very empathetic, and all I hear/see all day long is everything that is wrong with this world. it started to affect my mental health a lot. I'm stressed out whenever I'm online, but also start to get anxious when I'm not.

Another problem is: I listen to music on my phone pretty much all day long. It helps my anxiety. Now I would love to just turn my phone off and throw it aside, but then I can't listen to music either, and I don't want to stop that. It's also very tempting to just go online when you're skipping through the music on the phone, since it's just a click away.


I thought about deleting all online/social media apps, but this is kinda drastic, and I might regret it later.

17,"I'm 23 now and I've kind of repressed all of this so this is my first time writing it down/talking about it. To be honest, I've pushed it down so hard that I totally forgot that all of this even happened until recently. Keep in mind that I am the oldest child and my mom only did this with me.

When I was younger (mainly elementary school and middle school) my mom was very harsh on me. She has a lot of anxiety and definitely took it out on me. She also was not very affectionate towards me. Every time I did something wrong she would chase me around the house and hit me/spit on me etc. These would cause me to have anxiety attacks and start hyperventilating. She was also very emotionally/verbally abusive towards me. A big issue was that I had a problem with wetting the bed and she would make fun of me for it/hit me because of it. Some specifically traumatic times would be when she'd come to my room to wake me up at night to use the bathroom and she'd notice that I already wet the bed so she would wake me up and start screaming at me.

On top of this, she was very strict. If I ever got in trouble (I was a really smart and athletic kid so never anything major) she would ground me with no explanation on how long it would last or her reasoning. Also, absolutely no sleepovers. And if I had hung out with friends one day, that meant I definitely couldn't hang out with friends the next day. That kind of thing.

I was very emotionally closed-off because of this. I had trouble hugging family/telling them I love you/ showing them any type of emotion (whether positive or negative). I always had a huge need to please my parents and be extremely perfect so I put on a huge front. I was extremely scared to ask my parents for things. I remember I would often ask my sibling to ask my parents if I could go have a play date for me because I was too scared to ask them myself.

This all randomly subsided when I was like 16-17 and ever since I went to college, I've become much closer to my mom. We do a lot of traveling together now and stuff like that. She sometimes acknowledges the fact that she treated me badly when I was young and she always apologizes for it. I usually just brush it off because I don't want to make her feel bad. It has definitely had a huge affect on me though, I'm a very anxious perfectionist type of person. I work very hard and have a huge need to please others. I have history of eating disorder as well as the tendency to abuse drugs/alcohol. I also get pretty dependent on my SO when I am in a relationship.

All of these memories just randomly came back to me and I definitely think I need to address them with a therapist. I don't really know what the point of this post was but it felt good to write it out. Thinking about a 10 year old me being treated like this makes me so upset. Thanks for reading &lt;3

Edit: I have no bad feelings towards my mom btw. I understand that her anxiety/depression probably played a factor in how she treated me. She is also an immigrant from a country where hitting your child is pretty normal.",15Jun2020,2

20,"I am 23, I suffer from PTSD, Manic Depression, recovered alcoholism, past drug use,and past parental abuse. I am not the best at grammar so I am sorry if I irritate you in any way. 

Hello, I am going to be asking lots of questions, and explaining why I am here. As a young child, my father would yell at me, has slapped me several times, and was I believe Bipolar 2. To explain the reasons he has done so I will make it quick, and as simple as I can. He was beaten at a young age, he would wake up getting punched by his second stepfather, he would get slapped for spilling things on accident, he was held outside of a window by his collar from 3 stories. He acted out of course, I guess he had a plan to kill his oldest little brother, and my grandmother, and then blame it on his youngest brother. He was sent into a mental institution, came out even skinner, and fell into speed, and shot up as well. Though as he reached 19 he impregnated my mother with me,  giving him some type of purpose to continue living. When I was born, like a majority of fathers, he changed his ways, he was a neo-nazi, covered his tattoos and worked on becoming A+ certified, as I am currently doing. He was deeply troubled, and would snap into rage fits I called ""Caveman Anger"" saying demeaning things, and just so...angry at me. When Super Mario Sunshine came out, I walked quickly in front of the TV screen, causing him to die, and he freaked out, yelling at me, and throwing a the TV remote so fast and hard I heard the speed of it brushed past my ear hitting the sofa. My parents had been seperated since I was young, maybe 2 or 3. My mother was married to my first Step father who was a black man, anyways, I started crying of course, since he was in a severe anger stage, he took me home, driving irratically through my city of 70,000+ people, dropping me off at my mothers as I screamed for her, wanting love in a moment of fear, a sincere knowing of protection, and care. My father was in IT and was incredibly smart, he shut a whole computer company down cause they were doing something he didnt agree with causing him to, you guessed it, flip out, He had a family friend take all of his hard drives, and bury them. The FBI couldn't find anything against him, he lost his job, and any chance of being in IT field again I guess idk I was too young, and too focused on video games and books to escape. He became the guy that lived in his mothers basement, especially so after I told him to download the 14-day free trial of WoW, he withdrew from society, and my life. Stopped talking to me, though I went to my grandmothers every other weekend, but hung out with my grandparents, who would take me to KC to go out to eat, and we would go to Barnes and Nobles for them to get me a new book I would quickly digest in a matter of a day or two maybe 3. As I reached 12 I was raped by a man who told me there was an awesome fort in the woods, I of course eager to see it told him to prove it to me, I do not remember much of the incident, besides pushing him off of me with such insane strength as I was a skinny white boy, that looked like I hadnt eaten in days, but I ate alot lol. Anyways, I had ran to a friends to tell him that, I ran so hard and so fast, I never looked back, I didnt care too. I was hanging out with the older teens, some my age would go and hang out with this 19 year old who would watch WWE matches, he was an awesome guy along with my 3 other friends. My 3 other friends took me to the office as I lived in an aprtement complex. The walk to there was long, as I was crying, and it was hot, my 19 year old friend was so angry he was taking a bat to all his possessions, ultra rare WWE figures in the box, in mint condition. They had to leave as I told the office lady what had happened, I was in a state of shock, of disbelief, it was a hazey dream I remember too well of everything else but the incident, which bothered me, it must have been so traumatic that I guess I couldn't truly process the event correctly shutting me down into a lifeless husk of a human, as I probably laid there motionless. I continued to act like nothing much had happened to me, I guess my father was trying to not kill the man, and I had uncles and family members who almost got past the cops arresting him and killed him. One of my older cousins who was like an older brother gave me my first real pocket knife, as I held it in my hand, I wanted to just stab my throat over and over, brushing off the thought, I mentally retreated into a new mental hole, becoming the lifeless husk of my former self that was outgoing. I went on autopilot, waking up sometimes screaming and kicking, and a bed full of sweat as my mother rushes to my room crying and holding me saying she was so sorry she couldnt be there to protect me. I was guessing that my father who still was not talking to me was thinking, he comepletley gave up on life. I went to catholic school, and I do not want to cause any religious arguments, but I had lost any faith I had in any religion, solely focusing on escapism through video games, and now a new form of entertainment, drugs. Weed was okay for me I guess, I skated and found friends outside of the catholic school full of stuck up rich kids, I was the poor kid of course, I got kciked out of catholic school, placing me in a public school. After my 7th grade year, I stayed a cousins houses, venturing out into the nights to escape my life. It was august, I believe, I was in my cousins room downstairs in his basement, playing call of duty black ops 1, I got called up, it was my uncle from my fathers side of the family, he told me to come take a walk with him, anxiety filled me, I was walking with him, and he was trying so hard not to cry for some reason,  I could see that something was bothering him, and I asked him what was wrong but he told me that my grandma wanted to talk to me. We reached my grandmas house, as my aunts, her 7 other sisters,stood outside crying, she ran to me saying that my father had shot himself, I was 14, yet again going through another traumatic event, I again, in disbelief as any child would be. I sat in the room I would stay in on the weekends and cried with her, I ran out the back door, seeing my two uncles, his brothers, cry, I had to get away, I had to run, just like how I ran from ""That Man"", I ran from in the forest. I ran back to my uncles house who only lived a block away who was my fathers best friend back in the day, who gave the blessing of my father to date my mother. I balled into his arms, and him freaking out asking me what was going on I told him that my dad killed himself, he called my mother, my mother came and got me yet again to embrace me into protection, and comfort, but I was still in autopilot lifeless husk mode in some way shape or form though I felt emotions. It was after that I truly felt alone, and defeated, even after the abuse the yelling and demeaning name callings I loved my father, I just wanted to sit on his lap again and play PC games like Quake, and half life. I wanted to hear his deep voice, though I thought it was a prank of some kind an evil prank, that he was going to walk in through my bedroom door at my mothers house and call my name as he would in his deep voice. He would share songs with me such as Joy Division, The Cure, Ministry, White Zombie, punk, techno such as Crystal Castles etc. The Cure is what stuck with me the most because before he passed he would always put them on, and I never thought to actually understand that he was communicating through music. though he told me he loved me, he couldnt show it , cause as a kid, he wasnt shown. As an adult I didnt get a job until I was 19 at a local Taco Bell, then I retreated to my grandmothers on my fathers side, and became a hermit, only going out to get cigarettes, and hang out with friends that had weed, though I dont consider weed to be a hard drug, or a gateway drug, I fell in love with speed, it gave me happiness as the drug does, an overload of seratonin to make me go go go, and be happy happy happy. I did pills, drank though I was a lightweight when it came to alcohol id still push myself to keep drinking, and Id even throw up and continue drinking until I blacked out. Through the years of my teenage past life, I had attempted to take my life several times with ibuprofen, but would just wake up the next day feeling sick, I was almsot unable to die, to scared to slice my wrists, or my throat, I wanted to pass away in my sleep,I just couldnt die. As I hit 21 I was working at a Bar and Grill, and I would get a triple shot of jager in a to go cup filled with energy drink (a vegas bomb or jager bomb)  Id drink a few of those, and I would be so drunk but so wired I could feel my heart pounding out of my chest yet I am wasted. As time went by I finally bought my own car at 22, and took forever to get my liscence. I promised my family I wouldnt drink and drive, yet I did, I got off work from a Texas Roadhouse, which was always busy everyday, mentally, and pyschically demanding, hot and tired I worked almost everyday. I never got a raise though I would help as many people as I could, anyways, I went to the Bar and Grill I last worked at to get that sweet, sweet liquor in me. Still a lightweight, I drank, I didnt eat at all that day, and drove home to be balcked out rolled my car on a parkway, totalled hit, yet I didnt hit anyone, I dont even hardly remember what happened I was so wasted. that was over a year ago, I feel disguested with myself each and everyday, I could've killed someone, I could had taken a precious babies life, or a fellow citizens life. I wanted to die again, I betrayed the promises I once made to my family, and to myself. I never condone anyone to drink and drive, though its still illegal for some dumb reason, just walk fucking home, or call a cab. I still havent forgiven myself for it yet I should because I didnt hurt anyone, or myself. Yet I have flashbacks of the anxiety of coming to, and being in jail. I continued workin at the Texas Roadhouse, and promised myself I wouldnt ever drink, yet I lied to myself again, and my family. Family being mad at you isnt the worst thing, it is when they say they are dissapointed in you, and your actions. I gotten 3 grand from my car, I blew it on more video games, blow, booze, shrooms, and shit load of good weed. I went to a friends bday party last august, and blacked out, waking up on my grandparents' house on their front lawn, I was filled with anxiety, of what happened, I rushed to the bathroom to throwup, only to throw up blood, my grandmother being a nurse, had had enough of this and booked me to a rehab which was 1,200 miles away, a two day drive, it was all so fast to make the decision yet i said yes only to get there and it be some kind of christian cult rehab where the only way to progress is to accept jesus as your master, your lord, and saviour. I demanded my grandparents to pick me up and take me home, they didnt speak to me for the two day drive back home which was the longest drive of my life. I had had a therapist, and was on two different medications after my DWI, and my therapist before my DWI. Idk how much longer I can type anymore, but I have images of myself shooting myself, of some distorted figure screaming at me in my face, as I day dream about it. The final moments of my own life transforming into my fathers stand off with the police in a hotel in his final moment to shoot himself. I think about the sweet release of death, to take me from this world that had defeated me, yet I stay strong, do my breathing excersises, and walk outsideif needed though i still reside inside, to play my bass guitar, to listen to Black Metal bands the only bands that I truly care about Leviathan, and Xasthur. To sit and face those thoughts head on, though some times they consume my thoughts. I do not want to take my life, nor harm others in any way. I just sit in misery though I act happy, ashamed of my DWI, ashamed of being raped, ashamed of being me. Being defeated, I too have gave up on life, but I still want to drag myself along to someday finally grasp my meaning of life, other than sitting in my room day dreaming of being in a band, or what comes after my death in the eternal void of nothingness. To finally not be able to feel even numb. Again I do not want to die, though it may seem life I am trying to convince myself, it is true. Do you have images of your distorted figured self screaming at you as you day dream? Why do I imagine that? Why do I always become a hermit of my room? Why? I dont know if ill ever return to this post for fear of embarssment. But I want to assure you dear reader, that i am in fact not going to take my life, I guess I just maybe needed to type this out  idk. Maybe this will make someone else, another dear reader, not feel so alone, becuase youre not either.",15Jun2020,1
23,"At the end of the first semester of my freshman year of college, I started struggling with depression and anxiety a lot because of feeling lonely from not making as many friends as other people, living alone, and feeling lost about my future. It also may be the fact that I don’t trust myself to make good decisions for my life on my own, maybe because I’m not used to it.

The 2nd year rolled around and I found roommates that I really liked and spent a lot of time with. They eventually became my main group of friends. I still struggled a lot with anxiety and feeling lost.

The 2nd year just ended and I still can’t shake the feeling of loneliness and feeling lost, even though I’ve made my mind up on a major and made a few friends. I even have a boyfriend now, and go to therapy, but I don’t know why I feel this way still. I’m hoping that it’s just a phase I’m going through in struggling to adjust to college, but I feel kind of hopeless still.",15Jun2020,1
24,"Starting off I will say that I am a junior in college with a 4.0 gpa (I work very hard) and I plan on applying to med school when I graduate.

My question is pertaining to a feeling I constantly have about not really understanding a lot about life (and medicine in general). It seems to me that the more I try to find answers, the more I end up running into questions that I am inclined to find answers to. I also understand that this is literally how learning is done and it may be a good habit to have; however, this way of thinking constantly gives me anxiety and is extremely tiring (it is an OCD like way of thinking).

I want to ask those of you in this community who have moved on from their college years if this analytical way of thinking is just a result of constantly dealing with the stress from college or if it is just a specific way of thinking in some people?

To clarify: Is this way of thinking permanent or does the way you think / approach life in general continue to change as you continue to grow older?",15Jun2020,1

I don’t talk about my mental health  and no one really knows about what I’m going through, I have this facade of this happy-go-lucky attitude. Today an actor committed suicide and I see a lot of people (famous and people I personally know) posting on social media of saying how people should “reach out if you’re struggling and don’t feel alone, etc”. Honestly it’s just BS. Because you fail to do this to people in YOUR life. No one is to blame for suicide of course. However, I cannot hear these false pretence of people caring about mental health when someone dies. Why is this talked about ONLY when someone dies. Honestly, my heart dropped today and I just can’t stop thinking about this. The people that have “urged” others to reach out are the ones that have never paid attention to me in real life and then they go and say how much they care about others. I’m not blaming anything for anything but I can’t help but think it’s bullshit.",15Jun2020,1
26,"Lately I’ve just felt so crappy and down. I feel worthless at this point. My girlfriend had changed severely since the whole lockdown started from COVID and when I finally pulled her up about it we argued for about 12 hours on and off over snapchat until she finally came out and told me she had schizophrenia. She’d been lying to me about it for 3 whole years of me knowing her and falling in love with her. Turns out that the voice internally communicating with her is what has made her basically take 0 interest in me for the best part of 3 months. Finding this out has crushed me and I don’t know what to trust is true from her anymore. I have been sat here sobbing on my bedroom floor for hours trying to figure out what to do. I’m starting to have really really dark thoughts I feel worthless and better off dead.

For example, In one of them, me and some guy were robbing a bank, and the guy ended up getting shot in front of me.

Could this maybe be because of past trauma? I had some traumatic things happen to me as a child, but nothing related to physical violence.

32,"Let me start with this: all my therapy is (thankfully) covered by Medi-Cal. I have reported and compained about the two bad therapists discussed below.

My first therapist lasted for 4 months and we mutually agreed I wasn't getting any better and I saw someone new. She refused to diagnose me the whole tome though.

After 10 minutes, the new one said ""I cant help you. You're too complicated. I'm ending this"" and quit the Zoom session. I reported her and complained.

One week later, the new guy YELLED AT ME and said ""I have helped people much worse than you but you can't be helped"". I also reported and complained.

Now I'm 3 sessions in with another new guy and I like him but it isn't going anywhere at all. 3 weeks and he hasn't given a single bit of advice or homework or anything. He's gathering information but it's taking too long. 

He did diagnose me with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder in the first session, at least.

I have been on meds for 5 months and it hasn't helped at all and my psychiatrist just says ""it takes time"". He also refuses a diagnoses, only ""unspecified mood disorder"" sayingn diagnoses take time as well.

I have been depressed for 7 years. Since then I've only gotten worse: suicidal ideation, paranoia.

I also did therapy a couple years ago for a year and it didn't help (and that cost 15 bucks a session and wasn't fully covered like it is now).

I just want to die now.

She spent almost a month in the hospital before our daughter was born and every single night I was there I slept there hell outside of work I lived at the hospital. It wasn’t too bad they had a couch that converted to a bed and I’m an infantryman so I’ve lived off less. My wife was hospitalized 4 days ago for gallbladder problems. They’re most likely going to have to do surgery it’s just a matter of when. And they’ve discovered other issues since she’s been there. They’ve even talked about keeping her until our baby boy gets here. In the past I had no issue living in the hospital but now it’s different we have a child already I can’t stay at the hospital with her especially with everything going on in the world and I work in law enforcement now so I’m having to put in a lot of hours (that’s a different topic don’t hate me I’m a person just like you) I’m lucky enough that my family helps me and I’ve been able to go and see her for at least an hour a day but I don’t sleep I feel worthless because I can’t help her I can barely manage my own daughter without her.

Bipolar: I sometimes lose my cool and have outbursts of pure rage and anger. I also occasionally can unintentionally be a straight dick head. I wish I could control this. I’ve lost friends over that stuff.
Depression: sadness, suicidal thoughts, self hate, and a range of other shit.

51,"
Honestly, I’m just a bit sad. Growing up, my parents were emotionally abusive. Called me names, gaslighted me, and when I wanted to open up emotionally, they just didn’t care, or shamed me for it. I also wasn’t given much attention or was shown that I was loved. I experienced some physical abuse too. Just a generally toxic environment. 

But that’s all besides the point. I’m afraid I have issues because of this. I never thought I’d be saying this, but I’m kinda sensitive. Sometimes I feel as if my friends/family don’t care. And when I feel this way, it saddens me and upsets me, so I kinda get rude. Which isn’t good, and I always feel guilty later or apologize. I don’t ever want to be a horrible person, ever.

Sometimes I just get really angry. Like when my parents are yelling at me or badgering me, and it makes me want to lash out. But I just hold it in. I’ve pinched myself and stuff before, so I don’t punch anything. Sometimes I just hide my emotions. Never show them. Like inside I could be boiling, but never say anything. There’s times where I’m mad about something for a long time. I never like talking about my feelings, and I have severe trust issues. 

I don’t have many friends, or close ones. I’ve been improving with that, though. It’s hard since I have Asperger’s, but I haven’t let it hold me back, and I’m trying to improve. So, I have no one to talk to this stuff about. And sometimes if I make a mistake, I dwell on it for a long time, and blame myself depending on what it is. And I overthink everything, and am always worried about something. It’s not good

52,"i apologize in advance if i sound ridiculous or annoying. i keep these thoughts completely internal 98% of the time. also i didn't know what mental forum this has to do with specifically, so i'll just post it here. i know nobody here is a doctor, but just let me know if you have a similar experience. obviously i'll talk to my doctor about this, but first i just wanted to see if other people have similar problems and what causes it for them. basically i take almost everything the wrong way. my brain immediately makes me think that everyone has bad intentions or that they HATE me. for example, someone could DM me on social media and my brain automatically assumes that they have ill intentions even if it was a completely normal DM ( in the moment i don't see these interactions as ""normal"" but looking back on it, i can see that i was being overly paranoid). i could order a coffee from a shop and if the person working there didn't seem to like me, i'll assume they did something to my drink. i don't know if i was imagining it or if it actually happened, but i was ordering a smoothie one time and i was convinced i saw the girl put something from the trashcan in my drink (i didn't say anything of course) and my bf at the time had to drink it to prove to me that it was fine. still wasn't convinced.  at my job (i work in food service), i fear that if i have a bad experience with an overly angry customer, that they'll come back and harm me. one time i thought this girl was trying to hack my phone all because she was facetiming me (which she never does), turns out she just wanted to ask if i wanted to go to the beach.  obviously i can occasionally rationalize with myself in the moment and realize that i'm digging too deeply into things, but it just gets so exhausting being this way. they say ""listen to your gut"" but i can't even trust my own gut feeling. there were long periods of time when i genuinely was concerned that a few people were gonna kill me, even though looking back on it there was absolutely no valid reason to be thinking that way. i'll assume a car is following me when it turns out they're just going the same way, or if i'm walking my dog i feel like someone's constantly behind me. as a child i was convinced there were secret cameras hidden in my stuffed plushies, so i'd occasionally open them and then stitch them back up just to make sure (this problem went away as i got older of course).  i know i sound self-aware but in the moment it is so hard to not be so scared. most of the time, while the thoughts are happening, i don't realize that i was thinking wrongly and irrationally until i look back on it once my brain is ""normal"" again. i just always feel like everyone in my life knows something i don't and the interactions are fake. there's a lot more i can't think of right now, but this is the gist of it. i keep most of this internal, and i have friends and i'm still able to have healthy relationships and hold a job and get through classes, but my brain just makes me so tired sometimes, like i can't trust my own view of the world",15Jun2020,1
53,"I currently take Prozac, but I still have a major problem with absolutely no motivation at all. I'm almost 30 and i just feel like it's absolutely ruining my life. I mainly take Prozac for anxiety as it never did much for depression. Antipsychotics  have been the only drugs that help with that in my case. That being said I stopped my antipsychotic over a month ago and seem to be doing fine mood wise. I stopped because I thought it was affecting my motivation and energy. It appears I was wrong, or there is at least more going on. Since I'm not feeling depressed at the moment I'm not going to bother go back to it. I realize all SSRIs for the most part are super similar, but i thought maybe the effects might vary. Are SNRIs better at helping the motivation aspect of depression? Or is it likely I need to look at a totally different class of meds?   


I have a doctors appointment tomorrow, and unfortunately it's only via the phone because of COVID, so I dont feel like I'll have as much of a chance to elaborate on how I feel, and in the past my doctor has been totally fine with me doing research online and then asking him what his thoughts are on certain meds. More often than not he's been willing to let me try things I ask about.  


The only suggestion I'm not looking for is Adderall. I already take Dexedrine for school, but I'm already on the max dosage and I only like to take it when I need to really focus on my studying. It's literally a silver bullet, but I don't like the thought of taking it daily, especially at the maximum dose which seems to be the only effective dosage for me, and I dont want my tolerance to go up. So if there is some none amphetamine that helps improve motivation/drive, that's what I'm looking for. I realize it wont be as much of a silver bullet as an amphetamine, but that's fine. I just want to not be stuck behind anymore. I'm trying to study to get into a program so that I can get my life ahead. I actually took about 3 months off of Dexedrine to see how much I could do on my own compared to taking the medication, and the amount I've accomplished in these 3 months is honestly probably less than 1 week taking Dexedrine. Not only was this disheartening cuz I don't want to rely on an amphetamine where my brain expects to almost have like an 'on switch' just to be productive, but I lost about 3 months worth of studying which means i'm probably not going to get into the program when I wanted to.",15Jun2020,2

Never had a girlfriend, never held a girls hand, never kissed a girl, never had sex, never even flirted or gone on a date. When I say I have no friends, I'm serious. I have never had a friend, never had someone over to my house, never shot the shit over lunch, nada. All of this isn't for a lack of trying. I'm quite smart, relatively attractive, I have hobbies, play sports and instruments. I'm anxious socially but push myself to talk to people. People seem to like me, but never want to be a friend. I'm finished high school my graduation is next week, online, socially distanced. I don't even get to say bye to my teachers. The people around me have girlfriends and they go out to parties, go surfing and skiing together. I would be lying if I said I wasn't jealous. I don't want sex I just want someone to love, someone to hold and just talk with. Before you say the people in my high school are probably just drunk teenage assholes, they aren't. The vast majority of people in my grade are great, cool, talented people. I don't know where I went wrong. When I was a sophomore I told myself it was about how I looked so I cleaned up, got a new wardrobe and got super fit. I used to be insecure about my height even though I'm 5'11"". I've grown out of that stage and I understand that it's about how you act more than how you look. Thing is I act well. I'm kind and empathetic to everyone. When there are group projects I pull my own, but I am not bossy. We did a French class where we described everyone in the class in french anonymously, people said I was funny and sweet. I just don't get it. I feel like I have missed out on high school, and before you say highschool is lame and not worth anything, it sure feels like it matters right now. I'm 18 in a couple of hours, don't have anybody to spend it with. I don't have a party, not that I want one. I was supposed to go to university next year, and I thought it would be a fresh start. Turns out engineering will be fully online. I don't get to go to the campus, I won't be able to live in dorms won't get that experience either.

58,"Today when I was at work, out of nowhere i started having delusions. I’m a cashier at a discount retail store (summer job while i’m in college) and today a customer started putting their stuff down and i immediately had a bad feeling. The items seemed to have some liquid on them, and there was a weird (not bad, just weird) smell, which i think was real but now i don’t know. when they went to pay, in addition to their change they gave me a round, penny sized sticky thing, which i thought was some sort of drug that would seep into my skin. These thoughts made everything about my mind completely different for a bit, and my chest felt weird and i felt dizzy and lightheaded. After only 5 or so minutes, the thoughts about being drugged went away, but this was by no means over. (My lifelong friend had a couple psychotic episodes the other month, and had to spend a week in the hospital twice. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He was not the same person anymore for a while, he has recently started to become himself again but not fully because he is on medication.) For the next 25 minutes or so, i was just incredibly worried about this happening to me. My initial thoughts went away, but the general anxiety, panic and physical feelings in my chest and head did not. For the rest of the day since then, I’ve been doing pretty well, just occasionally worrying about the instance. I have not found anything anywhere on the internet about a psychosis episode that only lasts 30 minutes, so i am genuinely confused about what happened earlier. Maybe it was just some sort of panic attack, i’m not sure. If anyone has any idea and can let me know, please do. Thank you.",15Jun2020,1

he also extremely hates certain words/ ways of pronouncing words and refuses to say them. When we say the words /pronounce them normally he gets angry and throws a tantrum, often crying and getting a bit violent.

He forces my parents to do crap for him that he should be doing by himself, like eating with utensils.

a few examples of the sounds he hates are the words ""tongue"" or ""sorry"" and if we pronounce bottom like ""boddom"" (he gets really mad at that one).

Tw animal death?

I’m sorry if this has been answered before or has an obvious answer. 

When I was 11 I watched my dog die who was my best and closest friend. Before this I was a pretty happy kid and lived life pretty intensely and presently.

After that though things changed, I got severely depressed etc. But one thing I’m wondering about is a thought pattern I picked up where I felt like I was operating a character and not living. 

Like I never felt completely present in any of my life for a long time. Like I have watched horrible things happen in front of me since then and not reacted then had to remind myself to react because I’m real and this is real. Sometimes I just don’t feel anything and I can watch bad things happen completely passively, which I feel very guilty about because it’s allowed people in my life to be hurt or bullied without me stepping up. 

For a long time I didn’t really internalize a lot of what was happening in my life. I have moments where I’ll watch a bad thing happen, it vaguely bothers me like it would if I saw it on TV and then I remind myself to feel present and that this is real and I feel it the more intense and appropriate amount then. I have felt like I was a character kinda. It’s hard to describe exactly how it feels. Like I am watching through someone else’s eyes and it’s not completely real, like a tv show.

64,"I’m (18F) from the USA, and while there hasn’t been a true lockdown, I have been self quarantining to the best of my ability. The only person I’ve seen for the most part is my boyfriend (18M) of seven months.

Before this, I was thriving. I had a nice group of friends, was always occupied with school, extracurriculars, and social stuffs, and I genuinely was enjoying life. Two to three years ago my mental health was horrible- for over a year, I felt hopeless and lonely and had plans to kill myself, but I got better. I never wanted to slip back into my old habits again, but that’s what’s been happening. I think it might be the monotony or the relative social isolation or not always being occupied. I had trouble with everything from the start of it around 3 months about, but it got really bad about three/four weeks ago when I had a panic attack that kept me up all night. Ever since then, I’ve physically felt myself deteriorate to the point where I can’t hold it in anymore. 

I’ve been getting so anxious that I shake multiple times a day, and I’ve been crying almost every night. Sometimes I start overthinking over something small and I spiral out of control, and sometimes I don’t even know why I’m freaking out. I’ve been upsetting my boyfriend because I keep asking if he still likes me/ if he still cares about me/ if he still wants to date me, and I don’t want to keep doing it but it’s like I can’t help it. I know he loves me, I just need reassurance constantly. He said he doesn’t know how to help and he’s tired of seeing me cry every time we hang out. He also said that he’s not going to break up with me, but I’m scared I’m going to make him resent me. I feel so guilty. I feel like I’m putting so much strain on our relationship right now and I’m so so so worried about losing it, both because I love him dearly and because I don’t know if I could handle having no one right now. 

Ive reached out to my 3 friends, but I’ve been feeling very disconnected from them. One practically disappeared, while the other two have been talking to me on occasion. I opened up to one of them about how I’m feeling a few times, and it makes me feel better in the moment but it doesn’t fix me. 

I set up an appointment with a cognitive behavioral therapist for a few days from now, and I genuinely want to get better. I’m scared and I’m worried that it’s not going to work. I can’t handle being like this again, I feel like I’m breaking. Can anyone give me some advice on things to do to get me back to normal? How to make the most of therapy, and what to expect? How to stop worrying about my relationship, and how to stop ruining it with my irrational worrying? 

I really really just wish things were normal right now; I’m sorry to all of those impacted by the events in the world right now. I know I have it relatively easy compared to some people, but I still really feel messed up. 

TLDR; social isolation and lack of constant stimulation in my life have caused my mental health to decline. I’m meeting with a therapist soon, but I’m scared and don’t know what to do to make myself better again.",15Jun2020,2
65,"8th going to 9th grader here. Depression started in 7th grade of loneliness, but I kinda just ignored it and got by it at the end of 7th grade. It came back in 8th grade, especially now at home; I get the usual major depression symptoms in ""episodes"", which usually last like 3 hours. During the episodes, I also babble a lot; my words are coherent, but I just repeat them over and over. Also, if an episode is really intense or depressive for me, I start to scream loudly and wheeze. There is about a 2 or 3 day gap when another depressive episode starts again, and I can almost predict when I'm about to have another feeling of depression again. The cause of each episode is just something minor, and from what I can tell it seems to be atypical depression (correct me if I'm wrong). Please tell me if this depression or if this is just a part of growing up. Also tell me if I need to really ask my parents to take me to counseling; I tried telling them about what I felt and they just said that it was a part of ""growing up"". I've read some experiences about the growing up phases, but all of mine seem to be more intense, more lonely, and more hopeless than those described online.

P.S. I'm also the type of person who's really bad at hiding my emotions i.e. I cry a lot or I get visibly frustrated quite easily. Doesn't happen with anger though. I've been trying to separate my conscience from my emotions to the point where I seem like an emotionless robot since that's what seems most ideal to me. Also I've been the subject of a lot of bullying; not physical, but mainly being ostracized by the school and people treating me as a social pariah. Also I'm the nerd in school.

P.P.S - Coping mechanisms: Cooking, especially baking pastry, bread, and making confectioneries help me calm down but by parents always don't let me do it since apparently I clean it up too slow (I clean my mess up in a day, maybe two if some things need to soak). Also, I've thrown all of the more dangerous coping methods out of considerations, and I'm not depressed to the point of suicide yet.

By ""major depression symptoms"" I mean a lack of interest in anything, hopelessness, loneliness, not general sadness.'

I also read something called functional depression that is similar to my case I think?

I just graduated and at this point I’ve been starting to feel better than I ever have. My school was super cliquey and not always welcoming. I managed to make a couple of “friends” but I don’t even know if I’d call them that. Anyway I started a new job and the people I work with are pretty great. I work with people of varying ages and I get along with all of them. They are welcoming and helpful. I feel comfortable and am starting to gain some more confidence. I feel free to ask questions without being judged. Im able to talk and have a bit of fun with these people. The thought of going to college has me anxious. I feel like I’ll do well but the whole social part is what makes me nervous. I actually look forward to my work and coworkers now but I could never say the same for school. I feel like I’d just get excluded and be lonely again. I don’t want to be a loner for four more years. I really would like to make friends but it’s harder for me. I do struggle to make the first move sometimes. I’m someone who has never had much self confidence due to my history at my school.

For a long period of time (around last spring to now) I’ve barely been able to feel happy. I just seem to find the worst in myself and I feel like I’m helpless and alone. And I feel extremely shitty because I know a few people care and if I was gone they would miss me. But I really hate life. I feel like I’m losing my mind and I can split apart any second. It feels like an endless cycle where I lose my mind and break down then I feel like I’m better until I break down again. A lot of new things are happening this summer for me and I’m not going into detail but I’m scared I will be judged and I feel like the pressure of the world is collapsing in on me. I hardly find the will to sleep because I know my dreams will just be filled with dread. Everyday I wake up in agony because I can’t sleep because I stay up thinking about how awful of a person I am too. I can’t seem to find anything that I can do properly and I feel like I’m losing everything and am descending further into an abyss of madness. All of this and I can’t find joy that lasts a long period of time. I can be happy but it never lasts. I forgot how it feels to not be in pain. I just want to wake up knowing I will have a good day and people care and I won’t be judged on everything I hate about myself. I want help but I’m too scared to reach out and no one would believe me anyway and I think they don’t care even if I told them. I feel like whenever I try to bring it up with someone I’m close to I mess something up and I’ve been in a cycle of just ruining everything that I’m close to and I’m scared it will reach the people I’m closest to and I’ll push the away even I care a lot. I feel like I’m a burden on them and I cant help that. It just adds the cycle of self hatred and I look out more only to feel less like I can get something to help me. I’m just so scared of everything and I want to leave forever but I’m so scared. I’ve been on the edge of it so many times but I am too scared to do it. Because in the end I think I’m weak. And that’s what hurts the most. Knowing I don’t have the courage to do anything . I just want it to end and I want help but I’m not going to reach out because I’m too scared.

However when someone’s is around I can control it more or I’m more aware so I’ll stop myself. Idk y. So like I thought as long as no one else notices it’s ok? But I’m just not sure if it is.

I have also developed fears of losing my teeth and hair. I keep checking if have bald spots it freaks me out.

We intentionally / unintentionally do hurt people around us. It may not affect some but it does affect people without you even knowing how or why or when. Tbh I myself do not know how to get rid of depression , it fucks with the head in many ways. But we, being the fighters we are do try to fake a smile and lead on our normal lives thinking it was nothing/stupid . But before you even know it grows , weeks/months/years later it shows. And by then it would be really tough for you to continue normal lives. Mental illness is a real thing and I have always stressed about its importance . I am not a survivor but still suffering; with the help of a few friends I have done better and owe it out to them.

I’ve watched my sister and a close friend struggle with depression and self harm. Most of my life I was just the average guy I played some sports but mostly stayed in playing games. I moved states for about a year and did 11th grade in a completely different state across the country and I think that’s when it started. I had a hard time making friends and was generally alone most of the time. I eventually got sick of living with my mom and moved back to where I grew up with my dad. I went back to high school and got really into smoking weed, heavy drinking, dropping acid every weekend, whippets, and just being fucked up all the time. I went from the average guy to the one that was only know for his drug use which didn’t do well with the ladies. About half way through senior year I was kind of hooking up with my best friend but it was a little more but not dating. I over did with the drugs and I was traveling every week to go to a trade school 2 hours away. We ended that on a bad note and I lost all my friends because of it. I landed a job at a construction company and was making really good money. I didn’t have bills and was alone all the time. I started drinking heavier than I ever had. About a gallon of rum a week and this went on for 3 months then I got laid off and spent the winter unemployed. My dad was something else too he was always yelling at my and on my ass for stupid shit. I wasn’t the guy fucking either I was doing my best but it wasn’t good enough ever. That took a big toll on my mental health as drank myself to almost suicide. I put a loaded gun in my mouth multiple times just wanting to end it all and have the nightmare be over. I would also get drunk and cut my self too. I still have the scars all over my arm and chest and leg. Then my best friend who just got back from boot camp came back home and asked me if I wanted to move so we moved about 3 hours away.

And this thing gets to work when you are making a decision. Should I really do it? What if it goes wrong? Maybe it’s the right choice but your brain will trick into thinking of all kinds of negative things around that decision.

Thoughts are the base point for the “depression” that is going on in the world right now. When you keep thinking about all the negativity around one thing and it gets worse and worse. You try to think positive but the brain doesn’t let you.

But thoughts are not that bad. When you are excited about something and motivated, thoughts will boost that motivation but tricking you into thinking all the great things that might come.

76,"So, context:  (Sorry for text-wall)  


 About 2 years ago I got with someone, I'll just call them ""Ex"". Relationship was fine for a while, I had pretty big problems with insecurity, always sorta poking at my own image and looking for self validation. Both of us weren't perfect, but I'm sorta resigned into the fact the breakup was my fault. I never cursed or yelled at my ex, never directly insulted them or anything like that, but I feel like I was being a dick without really attempting to? I got called an evil, abusive, gas-lighting - mindtwister by the end of it by my ex, (Secondhand to one of my friends, not directly to me), and I know someone wouldn't say that just to be a dick, something is obviously wrong on my part. I was devastated by the breakup, and only THEN did I realize all of the stupid tiny little things I was doing wrong that all added up into pissing off my ex, and I begged them and pleaded, spamming their Pintrest and their friends to try and get in contact, I was crying whenever I thought about them, to the point of extreme excessiveness ( We had to see eachother daily in school ) But this isn't a post about trying to get an ex back.   


(End Context)  


It's been a year, I think, or maybe a little past that, since our breakup. It took me almost 365 days to actually throw away my ex's stuff, I kept telling myself no matter how bad it got, they would come back eventually if I was sad enough. I was suicidal in the first few months, but I was too scared to really commit to anything. In any case, My life is always going completely fine, and then suddenly I'll remember my ex? Like- I'll be doing random shit, and then all of a sudden my brain is like-  


""Remember your ex? You fucked that up. They were PERFECT, yeah they did some stuff to you but YOU were the one who ruined it. You will never find another one of them again. They were your soul-mate. It's your fault. Can't get with them again. Remember that instagram post you saw of them going to other countries? Having fun? Posting amazing selfies? That could've been YOUR life. But no, you're sitting here on your computer doing nothing, no wonder they left you. You haven't changed for shit.""  


I've read online up to six months for a breakup, varying levels of anxiety are normal, but it's been a year and even the mention of my ex's name makes my stomach twist into all kinds of knots. My friends are really agitated by it now and they always tell me to just ""not care"" or ""let go"", but I can't and I have no idea why. I've already pretended like I don't care for eons now, especially when I had to see them in school, but my heart refuses to actually stop caring. I'm not in contact with my ex every day anymore, but even the slightest mention makes me anxious to the point of vomiting or excluding myself from social activities just to try and get rid of the crippling guilt and anxiety I feel in my stomach. It's a mix inbetween feeling insecure about my own image, and a desperate longing to try and get back with them when I know 100% that it is \*OVER\*. My brain even tries to make me cry about it just by thinking it, even though I don't want to cry.  


This anxiety has practically taken over my life, I know I just need to let go, but I swear for the life of me I don't know how. I have another person I'm in a relationship with, and they love the hell out of me, but they also \*HATE\* my ex and talk about them constantly. I thought that would be amazing and give me self validation but it just makes me feel even more anxious, I can't even get in the mood when we're in bed unless I imagine my ex or people that look like them and I haven't told my partner yet.

There’s a lot of trauma that I don’t know how to deal with healthily and nothing that my therapist has said helps me and I’m beginning to feel hopeless and that I won’t be able to get over it. All through high school so about 2012-2016 I was told to kill myself everyday and called ugly and i didn’t get help until 2018 where I was diagnosed with mdd and mild anxiety. I just made this account because I can’t rely on anyone anymore even close friends and family. I don’t know who to turn to anymore. Please anyone,15Jun2020,1
82,"My sister was diagnosed with Lyme last spring after losing some sensation in her nerves or feeling some sort of nervous system discomfort in her limbs, and spent dozens of thousands of dollars treating her Lyme over the span of 2-3 months at expensive Lyme-specific centers here in the U.S. She returned home feeling worse. One doctor thought it could be CIDP and prescribed IV treatment for it. She discontinued it after the first few treatments, when her symptoms didn’t immediately go away and insisted it was Lyme. A few months later, tests from Stanford showed that while she has Lyme in her system, it’s inactive and not causing any ailment, and was still likely CIDP.  
  
She refused all treatment until a few months ago and tried the IVIG infusions again for 4 of 5 infusions in the week before giving up on it again. The doctor prescribed medication to help alleviate the symptoms, but she refused to take them for more than a day because it didn’t immediately help her. She would occasionally take one dose a day, instead of the three as prescribed, which obviously wasn’t doing anything for her except enforce her beliefs that hope was lost. The doctor said that her severe depression over this is what’s causing the most harm to her and she needs to get that treated. She's beautiful, successful, and vain, and feels that her near perfect life is lost forever. She's refused any sort of therapy or psychiatrist/psychologist. She’s been in bed for the majority of a year, and attributes her difficulty walking and weight loss, which seems to be normal for bed rest, to her illness.  
  
She has attempted suicide by hanging herself, fortunately she was found soon after her attempt and admitted to the hospital, but not psych ward. She was admitted to a psych ward a few weeks later, only when she sent goodbye texts to her family, snuck into her car, and drove away. She came back home after about 10 minutes, but the police had to take her to the hospital to make sure she wasn’t a danger to herself or others. I was told she wasn’t forced to take medication or see a psychologist or get any real help from the psych ward. From what I understood, the best they can do is make sure people don’t kill themselves. She occasionally threatens that she’ll try again, and last week she tried to starve herself but failed after a couple days. We don’t know what to do. She’s so negative and pessimistic and refuses to take medication as prescribed or try another treatment which might help her. Her daughter (22) has put her life on hold and been taking care of her for close to a year now. I’ve done the same, along with our mother, to support my niece for about 6 months now. My sister has had friends and family visit her and spend much of their time with her to try to get her to change her mentality to no avail.  
  
I feel that she might attempt suicide again soon/eventually, and even be successful. She says she would rather have cancer or aids, because at least that would kill her quicker. Or that she wished she would have died when she hung herself. Is our only option to call the police to admit her to a hospital every time she threatens suicide? She’s refusing any help for an illness that the doctor is optimistic about successfully treating. What can we do?",15Jun2020,1
83,"Hey, how are you all doing, hope you’re all safe and taking care of yourselves and your loved ones. So my question: is there anyone diagnosed with GAD might have a lot of questions related to their mental illness because i have many questions too that i want to relate with others but when i see no questions about GAD-related then i don’t know if here is the right sub to ask. Don’t perceive it from a way that only people diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder can only understand me, i know most of us might relate with things that are common not only people diagnosed with GAD. My point is, can i ask questions about GAD in this sub. Hope i didn’t cause any hate after reading this post. Have a great day everyone 🙌🌅.",15Jun2020,1
84,"Hi, I am fairly new to this subreddit, but I see a lot of people with more or less my issues so I am giving this a go. 

I am survivor. I had just turned sixteen when someone forced me to give up my dignity and most precious thing I had about myself. I never told anyone about it, it took me 12years to finally confess to my mother and brother, but weirdly enough that's not even the biggest culprit in my mental health. I sort of got over it in my own way, even if it means flinching when a male touches me, or carrying pepper spray in my backpack. I will also be undertaking therapy that will cover that part of my past pretty soon. But.

It's my most recent relationship, where I was promised mountains, given engagement ring six months into dating, urged to finish studies asap, and then basically shipped out of home to foreign country. He promised my parents, my brother and me that he'd take care of me, and he sort of did at the start of us living together, but as the time passed and he realised I don't really have anywhere to run, I am stuck with him at his mercy things changed very rapidly. 
I am not without blame, because once he stopped showing me any attention whatsoever, or any interest in spending time with me - I started looking for that outside our ""relationship"", and although it never got any further than a few, filled with genuine care and concern messages between me and another person I was immediately tagged as cheater, wasn't given any chance to explain myself and upon any argument it would be thrown in my face and used as final argument to defeat me. It completely took away my confidence, self-esteem and dignity. I started seeing myself as the monster he painted me as because that's all I ever heard. Like I said, I don't think I am without blame, but maybe if he had given me a chance to explain myself he'd understand that I didn't do it to hurt him, I was simply hurt myself by the lack of everything he showed me while I was still so far from his grip.

 I retreated from any social life, my social interactions were reduced to 12hours at work, I stopped asking if I can tag along when he goes out, I stopped asking if we could go somewhere in general, I basically completely withdrew from my life. I was reduced to cleaning/cooking, and if something wasn't done because I was tired after X amount of shifts in a row at work (used to work in healthcare for privately owned care home) I would be blamed for it straight away. I was forced to walk to and from work almost every time, whether it was snowing, raining or windy, I was always asked to do the shopping even though he was at home hours before me and drove a car. I didn't have any savings of my own because I was always paying for most of things, I wasn't allowed to question anything - he could stay up.on his.pc until 3-4am, but if I stayed up on my pc for half an hour longer after he had gone to bed, he'd be snooping on my laptop to.see what I am doing. I wasn't allowed password on my phone or tablet, I wasn't allowed to talk to anyone he didn't previously approve or was friends with. He had tremendous anger issues, to a point where he'd be screaming at me for the tiniest thing, punching walls and doors, which led to a very unfortunate event where weight lifting bar bounced off the door he smacked with his fist, flew right at me and cut my thigh. He was very apologetic but I already knew then that this will only get worse, so I started looking for a way out. Towards the end of this ""relationship"" it became his usual behaviour to scream at me, ignore me, show interest in me only if I had too much fun playing games with other people that he approved, it also became normal for him to throw in my face ""if I ever find out you're with someone else - I will find you and kill you both"" with a grin on his face. 
When I left I was blamed for every psychological issue he has now, I don't know what he told his family, but in my frantic escape I left quite a few sentimental items behind that I did not.manage to retrieve and probably never will, given most of his family lives in the same town and all of them use threats as jokes, and display anger issues on multiple occasions I think it would be very risky move to come over and try to retrieve my things. I did ask quite a few times, sent courier that was paid for the take my things but every time it was refused. He demanded that I come and take them myself. I knew immediately it's a trap and never agreed. It's been two and a half years since I left, and I still experience panic attacks that leave me lying in my bed until morning, convinced that he is standing behind my door, waiting for me to open so that he can keep up his promise. The amount of abuse I had gone through unknowingly is actively destroying my current relationship despite going through therapies. 
I don't know what I can do to help myself, I try and tell myself that he'd never do that, that it's very silly to think that, but I don't know what he is capable of, he was very unpredictable and unstable, last I heard he started smoking pot again and is accusing me of cutting himself, as well as dating another girl rather than looking for psychological help. I just hope for his own sake that he won't turn out to be that same person to her that he was toward me.

I am so sorry for how messy this post is but even writing this makes me incredibly anxious that he might find me this way. I just genuinely don't know what to do or how to free myself from his seemingly endless clutch over my emotional health. It's ruining my current relationship with someone who is so incredibly patient and understanding, someone who I genuinely think I can have good life with. Maybe I just wanted to vent, I don't know. Any advice or word of comfort is appreciated. And once again sorry for how messy this is - writing from my.phone while fighting anxiety attack.",15Jun2020,1

91,"Reddit community, please help. I stopped taking Lexapro abruptly and yes, I know that's a bad thing. I am just not able to figure out if I am going through a relapse or if what I'm experiencing is drug withdrawal symptoms. It has been only around 2 months since I started taking it again (previously I had taken Lexapro for 6 months last year and went cold turkey on it but never really experienced negative emotions) I have zero energy and motivation to do anything, I'm always tired and I overthink about everything. I get panicky thinking everyone else is being super productive these days and are getting ahead of me but still find it impossible to get up and do some work. I just end up binge-watching movies on Netflix ( I feel like it's just an escape mechanism) I tend to wake up and sometimes feel the need to cry for no reason. I feel the need to scream about what's bothering me and making me soo sad but then I realize I don't really have a particular reason as to why I feel that way and it becomes overwhelming sometimes. Oh, and my stomach is always upset these days. If there is anyone out there who went through a similar experience please help. What has been done is done. Is there any way I can manage these symptoms and ease the withdrawal on my own? I really do not want to go back on medications since I felt like they didn't work that well this time around (which is why I stopped taking it) And since my country is under lockdown I cannot see my psychiatrist in person and I did not find it satisfactory to converse with him over a phone call.

My dad said he is pleasantly surprised at how different I seem and that I seem more focused and more relaxed. I feel slightly less sedated/clumsy than I did before, but it's too early to tell if the difference is significant.

The street my house was on is steep and curves. She let me drive down the street, and all I can remember is her looking at her phone. This, in combination with me being always careful and antsy, caused me to scream at her to take the wheel. The thing is, she *completely* ignored me. I brought this up a while later and my mom gave me a confused face and told me that I wasn’t telling the truth, or something like that. See, my mom would never do something like that, but the memory was so vivid. This definitely wasn’t a dream. It is one of the questions I always have.

96,"I don't know if this should be posted here.

Recently I have been getting obsessive thoughts about being switched at birth, and that my parents are not the real ones. I know that I look like my brothers in some way, but sometimes I focus on the differences and tend to think the opposite. One thing for sure, the only way to determine 100% this didn't happen is to make a DNA test, otherwise there will always be a tiny possibility I was switched. I know the possibility is very, very small, but just imagining it could happen and that people make mistakes is disturbing.

Some of you would say that hospitals have procedures and that mothers will not commit a mistake like that, once they see you after delivery they will imprint your image in their mind and they won't mistake you for another baby. But just the fact it happened to others whom you can read about in the news, means it can theoretically happen to anyone.

100,"tl;dr Never had a meaningful connection, which made me a socially aloof adult. Don't know how to function due to mental health. 

Ever since I (m, 20) was a kid, I've always had the idea that other people have it worse than me. It was emphasized by the problems my sisters had with my parents. This kind of made me detached, keeping to myself as to not trouble them and generally being the ""good kid"" that avoided getting into trouble so I won't be in the limelight of gossip within my extended family. 

That caused me to be emotionally aloof and have a hard time communicating with people since I always handled things on my own due to the fear of being ridiculed for not being able to do a basic task. I haven't had experience with professional help since my country (Ph) has a terrible track record with these sort of stuff.

I had friends and relationships before, and have tried reaching out to them. But I always felt like they didn't really understand or got tired of it. Eventually the communication got distant and I feel bad since I feel like I inconvenienced them more than connecting. I also feel like a burden due to my painfully boring lifestyle and plain stoic personality. I'm afraid that it will always be like this and I'll be missing out in my life, and might also ruin my career in the future.

105,"I'll keep it as brief as I can.. I seem to be experiencing the same problems and thoughts all the time that are basically ruining my life. I literally can't enjoy anything anymore and it's more than depression and anxiety. In a nutshell here's how I would summarise it

1) I'm obsessed with trying to get laid. Like literally obsessed. I have a gf but all I think about 24/7 is trying to get with other women, travelling to get other women, running businesses to get women.  But the mad thing is, when i do have sex it's not as good as what you build it up to be in your head. I have no idea where this obsession comes from and it's there even when I'm getting laid. 

2) I'm from England and I have no interest in English women. Like zero interest. I only want foreign. What's the problem with this? Well, I only want foreign girls if I'm abroad. If I bang a foreign girl in London, I just don't enjoy it and I don't know why

3) I cannot stand normal life. Everything seems like absolute bollocks. I don't care about jobs, houses, material crap, but then I don't enjoy the little things either 

4) I'm obsessed with becoming famous or leaving a legacy. It literally drives everything I do. I think it comes from a huge fear of death and not achieving anything. 

Anyone have any ideas as to what my actual problem is? This is all completely ruining my life as my head is not in the here and now. I'm always dreaming about the future or making plans and schemes for mad stuff to do.

111,"Hello everyone. I know mental health can be a very difficult topic to discuss, but I wanted to share my experience with PTSD. I never thought I would be diagnosed with it, let alone experience the symptoms. My father is an alcoholic, and growing up he would go into fits of rage, show up to extracurricular activities drunk, or not show up at all. I never realized how much it affected me until after I graduated high school and started working. I constantly felt like I was going to be yelled at when I had done nothing wrong. There was a coworker who reminded me of my father, so when I was put in the same area as him I had almost unbearable anxiety. I isolated a lot and minimized human contact at work until I felt I was no longer human. I finally broke down when I woke up when it was still dark out, and thought I was in the bunk bed I slept in as a kid. I could see the bars of the top bunk over my head, even though they were no longer there. I completely lost track of where I was and laid frozen in terror until the sun peeked through my window, and I realized I was not where I thought I was. I also began having vivid nightmares, not about any particular experience, just vivid and horrific events that never took place. Sometimes I felt like I was in a dream at work, my surroundings only seemed like an illusion. Convinced I was losing my mind, I got the help I needed and am still trying to heal.

112,"I have very unstable relationships with my family and friends and it's making my life hell.

My family want nothing to do with me because I'm just horrible to be around. I get explosively angry at the smallest, most random things. I'm so easily set off and blow up from 0 to 100. My mum says she feels like she's walking on eggshells around me, terrified that she's going to set me off. It makes life so hard for my family, and for me as I'm constantly self-destructing by ruining my family relationships. 

With friendships I'm able to keep up a facade of being ok. I can control my anger around them, but it all builds up inside. I get deeply resentful of any small thing my friends do to upset me. Sometimes I love them, sometimes I hate them. I'm a very jealous friend. For example, I've voted against new members at clubs at school to avoid my friends in the club getting closer to new members. I've not had birthday parties because I'm afraid to invite friends from different areas of my life (e.g. school friends, outside of school friends, etc.) and have them mingle and meet each other. I can grow very bitter very quickly. 

Today was a horrible day. A few days ago my close friend had his 18th birthday party, and I wasn't invited. He invited 20 people (COVID restrictions), and I didn't make the cut. Of course, I was devastated. However, other people who didn't get invited were able to manage their anger/disappointment/sadness. Me though? I could not handle it. Broke down, called the friend out on our group chat with mutual friends, and just snapped. Then at school today I called out another friend for not being there for me. I feel like I have a tendency to sabotage relationships.

Could anybody enlighten me on maybe why I'm acting like this, what it could be indicative of, or ways I could fix this behaviour?",15Jun2020,1
113,"Hey reddit.

I'm a 19 year old in India. Although I am technically undiagnosed, I have suffered a lot of trauma in the past. My dad is an alcoholic who abuses my mum a lot when he's drunk. She's not perfect but has done nothing to deserve this abuse. The words he calls her are quite hard to listen to. He has called me a lot of shit in the past as well, and we have had bouts once or twice.

Whenever he has an episode, I am deeply impacted by what's happened but as soon as his episode is over, I am somewhat normal again. I do not know if I was dealing with the trauma or just suppressing it. All this has made me contemplate suicide in the past (a couple of times) but have never truly acted on it because I want to get her out of this mess.

None of the people I know are on reddit so that is why I am able to post this here. I do not know what to do. It's getting harder to deal with each time this hapens. I have had breakdowns as well.

He drinks everyday and is a bit abusive but every 2 months or so, he goes all out. Drinking for weeks straight. All day. We have tried stopping him, getting him in rehab, attending AA meetings as well.

My mum cannot get a divorce or have a separation because of societal constraints. Also, our family business is also partially dependent on him. I have enrolled in courses which statistically lead to high paying jobs so that I can get out of this. But every single exam of mine has an episode just before this. I need to study at least 10 hrs a day but am unable to do so rn.

The last time he came back from rehab, I told him that I couldn't live like this and told him I was feeling suicidal because of him. He told me he couldn't stop drinking, alcoholism is a disease and that I should support him. I have tried my best but I can't do this any longer. I can't live like this. 


Please tell me-what do I do?? I have lost my faith in God as well, have tried everything, words like ""it will get easier"" / ""everything will be alright"" seem fake and false reassurance. Rehab doesn't work, I cannot escape this. I can't even go out for a drive without risking my life.",15Jun2020,1
114,"I'm writing this from the comfort of my own bed as in trying to process the revelation I've had yesterday. 

For about 4 months now, everything in my life seems to be falling apart - upon closer inspection the biggest cause seems to be my recently developed short temper. 

I have had depression in my teens for which I have taken anti depressants, but for years I've been fortunate enough to have gained confidence, I was sure of myself, outgoing and had a ton of hobbies. However my mental health has been on a steep decline and upon closer investigation I seem to have all the symptoms pointing at the scary depression: 

Feeling helpless, loss of interest in hobbies, insomnia, huge anger and irritability, loss of energy, fatigue, self-loathing, reckless behaviour, loss of libido, concentration problems etc.

I have been extremely distracted. Losing track of conversations, zoning out, missing things like not realising my car is still in reverse instead of gear 1 (even though I just looked at a big fat R on the screen). Forgetting conversations, names, titles. I'm insanely distracted. 

I have always loved me time and tending to all of my hobbies. These past few weeks I havent touched a book or piano or even a video game. Just dreaded the idea. Instead I've begun doing stuff that distracted me from my thoughts, as I dreaded having only myself for company (I used to love love this) so since lockdown was lifted I've been going out where I can way, way more. However even now I have started to withdraw as my insecurities are beginning to fill the cracks. I feel like I'm no fun to be around, like my friends are around because they're somehow sorry for me. Like I cant make a joke. So I am starting to avoid going out to spare them the trouble. I havent felt like this in years. I know its irrational thinking, but it feels so so real to me right now. 

I have been extremely irritable. My relationship with my parents has suffered, whom I always got on great with. Now I get frustrated with every comment. 

And biggest of all - my long term relationship is beginning to crack because of this irritability. I have begun to nitpick on pretty much everything he does. Everything frustrates me. I take things the wrong way, I lose trust when we argue. It has taken a toll on both of us and I'm so tired of being this way. I love him so much and yet I cant get over this frustration. He seems to bouncing off me now and is starting to take things the wrong way too. We both want to save this relationship so badly, but I dont know what to do. My inability to concentrate for long bursts isn't helping either, because as he goes back to conversations weve had few days ago - I cant remember the details. 

I've been eating like shit, stopped exercising and have had surges in anxiety + very mild panick attacks. I have started to disassociate for a few minutes when I feel anxious - for those who dont know what this is - feeling detached, distanced from reality and emotions. All you're left with is mild anxiety about the state of disassociation you're in. It is a stress response to limit the negative triggers. Doesnt sound all that helpful to easing stress though, does it? 

Recent unemployment due to Covid is likely adding to the stress, as my savings ran out too. 

So as you can see I have a lot on my plate right now. I just dont know where to start fixing this. Therapy isnt an option right now, with offices closed due to covid restrictions and my ass being utterly broke. I dont want to go on anti depressants either. I guess I'm looking for people who are also struggling so I feel a bit less alone in all of this - and suggestions on what to do which have helped people in the past. I feel so insanely alone in this, I am surrounded by amazing people but I feel like they cant relate or give constructive advice on a topic they havent experienced.",15Jun2020,1
115,"This is a therapeutic post to help me get some thoughts straight and to reach out to anyone interested in commenting. Thank you if you read and thank you if you comment, but this is more just to get my head and heart on the same page. It's long and a little convoluted. But here it is.

I ran away from home at 23.

I didn't realize it at first, but yea that's almost exactly what I did. Just not from my parents home, but from my hometown. I thought I was running towards a solution by moving 15 hours drive from anyone or anywhere I'd ever known. I thought I could find a solution to my addiction to alcohol and anything that got me high. I thought I'd finally solve all my big problems. I sort of did.

Before the move I'd lay in bed after a day/night of drinking and smoking, torturing myself to sleep. 

In my mind I would place my childhood self in a corner and begin to loom over myself. I would make myself like those shadows I used to see in my bedroom corner as a child. Paralyzed with fear and helplessness. I tried to do to myself what those shadows did to me. Threatening myself with pain and death; murdering every scrap of love and joy inside of me because I didn't deserve it. I would call myself the weakest, dumbest, most gullible, least capable, least liked, most annoying person in existence. It goes without saying that there were plenty of thoughts of suicide and self abuse. One night in particular, when I got the closest, I had gotten in my car to drive to the Memphis-Arkansas bridge and jump. I gave myself a scar on my hip to remind myself of that night.

The things that stop me are sobering guilt and learning from others who have already ended their lives. They leave a trail of Destruction in the wake of their suicide and Destruction is a very close relative to whatever it is that made me this way. Destruction had become a habit I was very familiar with and I developed a skill in it through constant thought and daily practice upon myself. 

But I am a lover, not a fighter. You can see the problem when the way I was living was full of hatred. That's where the alcohol helped because it helped me slowly let go of my heartache with my parents and extended family. I had a nice life, but even my mom admitted to not really being able to love me. Alcohol helped me forgive and forget. But now that I have, it's time to move on.

This coalesced into one very big and very swift decision: moving to Tennessee. I moved 15 hours away from my hometown to live in Memphis, TN in what seemed like a week, but was actually about a month or so. I was so lost in a haze of weed, alcohol, and acid that I didn't really realize what was going on... I just said, yes I'll move to Memphis with you (my friend) and then boom there I was.

I was leaving everything behind. Trying to do better than I was. And 6 years later I am still unpacking that crazy mess.

I feel I may have failed my friends and family when I moved and of course because I developed a bad habit and a polluted heart. 

I choose to fight like hell to gain ground in being free from anxiety and fear; the control they have over my actions and the pain it so clearly causes in my friends and family who seem to take it personally. And I don't blame them. My parents deserve it. They didn't show me how to love but how to hate and to fear. But for all of their decisions during my younger years they are merely human mortals and deserving of forgiveness in all things. 

As a kid and teenager, my friends were loving enough to listen to my endless goings on about my sadness, even when it was completely irrelevant or untrue. I became addicted to the emotional release of talking about my problems. But now? Now I'm far away, not being loud, crazy, and energetic. Not being a comedian to my friends. Not lovingly encouraging and gently pushing them towards their greater growth. Nope. Just slowly losing life in a city that's only barely home.

I'm having a mid life crisis and I'm not even 30 yet. I guess it can happen at any time.

There's a short list of important things that have happened to me. At the top are my friends and my girlfriend. She saved me. She fought for me. She sacrificed more for me than she'll ever admit to. I love her like a sister and a mother. I love her like a friend and a partner. I couldn't have changed in the ways that I needed to without her. 

But, I am afraid that I am avoiding my future by staying in Memphis. She says when she gets a better position at work we'll move back to my hometown with me so it would be easy to find a good paying job. But, that's 2-3 more years. Can I wait that long? Maybe. Could be a good time to continue saving. Or, a waste of time not connecting to important people from my past, face to face.

I want to farm. I want land and crops and animals. I want mud and dirt and loud noises. I want wiry muscles from years of hard labor. I want to be a life time learner and a life time grower. I want to give more than I get. I want to be on my own, but I want a community. I want achy knees and a favorite walking cane. I want to work for myself but have some help to keep me from being subject to my own idiotic decisions. I want to work with like minded hippy business men and women and buy abandoned plots in cities and repurpose them to encourage social change: healthy families, financial and legal aid, courses on how to handle children, money, heartache and stress, understanding yourself and others. I want to make enough money to focus on humanitarian goals and self sufficient lifestyles. I want to change my tiny piece of the world to encourage others to live with love on the forefront of their conscious thoughts through all of their most difficult choices. I want to encourage wisdom and togetherness.

I'm afraid of running from Memphis because I might just be repeating the failure I think I committed when I ran from home.

I want to believe that if I ran back home I could start over, acquire some land, get to work, and make my dream real. That way I'd be close to the ones I think of all the time and they would share in my joy. 

But I do not trust myself. I constantly think things and then my brother, friend, or gf talks to me and helps me see how what I'm thinking is off base.

I blame the alcohol and drugs. They've made me slow and crippled by decisions. 

I don't know how to end this. I'm just glad to get it out there in the world and not stuck in my brain. Today I'm going to try to make it my best. I'm finally coming out of my shell and I'm actually hanging out with some people today. I read today that many successful people think in terms of decades and not individual years, so that's what I'm going to contemplate today. 

Thanks",15Jun2020,1
116,"I have a very close friend even though we have only know each other for 1/2 a year really they were the first person I told I was self harming and thinking about killing myself. They themselves have been though a lot and have self harmed they want to take me to get help but now they are really busy and don’t have the time. I thought they wanted me to get help so I have been trying to get help by myself but every time I start walking there I shake, literally vomit and cry ect I want to ask them to take me I just don’t have the guts I don’t like self harming and blood I do it because I deserve it. I don’t want more people to know that I’m self harming bc I’m normally the friend people come to for advice and help I just don’t want people to know that I’m hurting bc I have always been the stable friend in the friend group.

117,"I'm the introspective and analytic guy so, sometimes, I like to do my job alone, without the interference of others, and sometimes, when I interact with people, at the end of the day I feel exausted.

I work in a digital agency for a little more than three years. In the last year, before became de leader of my team, I've been the employee who worked a shift of 12 hours long, but I loved of what I was doing, taking care of 12 clients and my job was mostly hands on, without so many meetings. Recently I became the coordinator of my team, so I have to take care of 7 people, plus over 50 clients. And since the begining of the year all I'm doing now is doing meetings with current and new clients, leaving my team aside. I feel responsible for a lot of mistakes they've been doing, since I can't take a closer look at them because of all these meetings. Sometimes these meetings start at 9 a.m. and end 9 p.m., one after another, lunch in front of the PC was really commom (or not eating at all). Besides that, I've been disliking the way the company is being managed, since a new COO is in charge.

My worst breakdown came when I was talking with my new employee, showing to him a few things about the company, and seeing the messages in my whastapp, skype and e-mail coming up all at once, feeling really overwhelmed. When I finished speaking with this new employee, I called to a fried of mine and started to cry a lot.

Besides all that the coronavirus situation makes me feel bad too. I've been fearful that I contract this and let my parents sick too (both 70+). So I'm really concerned with them, while them don't believe in anything of what's happening.

For the past 30 days I'm having a breakdown, so working is being really difficult. For these past days I'm feeling:

* heavy chest
* couldn't sleep (or sleeping really late so I could enjoy more time away from work)
* I woke a lot of times feeling down and wanting to cry
* crying easily
* questioning about my work and myself
* isolating myself
* easily forgeting any information

I asked for a vacation so I could rest a little, hoping that I could feel better. I even disabled any notifications from my whatsapp so I could rest and don't think about them. But I'm in the last day of my vacation and can’t see an end to feeling this way. I've been thinking about changing carrers too, so I don't have to speak with clients.

I tried to speak with the CEO and the COO about that, but all they did was opening an excel table, write down a few solutions and asking if I have a solution too. There was no empathy to my feelings.

I don't know what this feeling is (burnout maybe?) and I don't know what to do. Should I quit my job and rest for a while?

Recently I started getting a psychological support, but still this feeling doesn't go away.

Ps: Sorry for my english, it's not my first language.

TL;DR: I'm really introspective and I think because of my job as a team coordinator, having to talk to alot of clients, going through a lot of stressful situations (like averting cancellations). Now I'm feeling really down about my work and myself latelly, and I don't know what to do or how make this feeling go away.",15Jun2020,1
118,"I come from a very small city, everyone knows everyone, you know the drill. I've been bullied for being fat since middle school and all through highschool (im a 17y/o female) so as you might imagine, I have practically no friends in my hometown. Everyone knows me as the fat lesbian chick (not a lesbian but hey, sure, whatever you say). Recently I've lost the only person that I considered a friend here. Now this person got all her new, better friends to create a shit tone of instagram accounts and anonymously harass me(call me names, threaten me etc.) I'm constantly anxious. I feel like I have no one to talk to during this quarantine, for almost a 100 days Ive been sitting in my room, scared to go outside. If I wanted to go for a walk I'd see at least one/two of my past bullies and have to relive all these memories again.

Today I feel... weird. I can't put my finger on it, and was wondering if there's a word for it?

127,"I'm a 28 year old girl.I've always been insecure about many things,but one thing that made me feel better was that,in my head,I was smarter than most people.I could easily see through people,their weaknesses and soft spots. Pretty much everyone seemed weak and beneath me.
When I was a kid I realised I didn't really get along with others,I couldn't really get how social skills work,or humour.When I got into uni I realised that my whole life I had a pattern when I chose my friends at school.I would always target the kid that was intellectually weak and had no friends,so they would depend on me and do what I wanted.I had also found some interesting ways to get out of trouble and I ve been very careful about how and when I used them.
For example,when I was 8 I beat up a kid and immediately ran to find my teacher, crying and saying how awful I felt about what I did.All lies.When the kid went to the teacher to tell on me,he was yelled at and I was praised for my courage.

I've done much worse since then of course,but what ""worries"" me is how early it started and how natural this was for me.
Kids never liked me,but teachers and principals did.Today,all my friends at work are managers.I talked my way out of jail when I was arrested for cocaine possession.I ve tricked so many people into thinking I possess specific skills when in reality I don't.I've been cruel,very cruel and emotionally abusive.
Empathy is not my strongest aspect.The only reason I probably wouldn't kill someone is because I don't want to end up in jail,although most of the time I see this as the fastest and most effective way to get someone out of the way.

I never really cared to see these things until now.Being an adult can really be a slap in the face,and my recent experiences made me redefine what I saw as ""being smart"".I don't think I'm that smart anymore.Im not dumb either,just mediocre.The only thing I'm good at is making people see what i want them to see in me.
But this made me realise that there is nothing else there.I'm just a con artist.I don't know what I want to do with my life,as I don't like anything or anyone deep down.I don't really have opinions.The only times I felt something strong for anyone were just toxic and psychotic feelings.

I'm not gonna lie,I don't really feel bad about the things I've done.For some reason I can't.But i know something is wrong and I want to know what it is.I'm tired of wasting my life feeling like an empty shell, detached from everything.Ive considered therapy but I cannot afford it at this moment.Has anyone experienced anything similar?Any suggestions on what could help?",15Jun2020,1

I hate it but sometimes I wish I could escape what I feel somehow. It's awful to think this way but sometimes it feels like my mind is sick but also really strong because I haven't cracked yet. I should be thankful for that but sometimes I wish it would all just stop. And sometimes I question if I'm really as depressed as doctors and professionals say I am.

I experienced some physical abuse too. Just a generally toxic environment. 

But that’s all besides the point. I’m afraid I have issues because of this. I never thought I’d be saying this, but I’m kinda sensitive. Sometimes I feel as if my friends/family don’t care. And when I feel this way, it saddens me and upsets me, so I kinda get rude. Which isn’t good, and I always feel guilty later or apologize. I don’t ever want to be a horrible person, ever.

Sometimes I just get really angry. Like when my parents are yelling at me or badgering me, and it makes me want to lash out. But I just hold it in. I’ve pinched myself and stuff before, so I don’t punch anything. Sometimes I just hide my emotions. Never show them. Like inside I could be boiling, but never say anything. There’s times where I’m mad about something for a long time. I never like talking about my feelings, and I have severe trust issues. 

I don’t have many friends, or close ones. I’ve been improving with that, though. It’s hard since I have Asperger’s, but I haven’t let it hold me back, and I’m trying to improve. So, I have no one to talk to this stuff about. And sometimes if I make a mistake, I dwell on it for a long time, and blame myself depending on what it is.

136,"So I’m in the middle of my teenage years, and I’ve recently felt like I could possibly suffer from depression, anxiety, bipolar, and self destructive habits.

Lately I can also literally never fall asleep and I longer enjoy many of the things I used to enjoy. I also don’t enjoy things like chips or cookies, and doing things like playing video games just feels like a routinely thing I don’t really enjoy much anymore, and I can only do things for an hour at a time before I lose interest.

I also randomly decide that I’m gonna quit bad habits, go outside, excercise everyday, and eat healthier, and then I forget about it all in like an hour or two.

In the meantime, I'm writing a detailed account of my mental health background and current situation with the plan of sending that to my counselor right off the bat. In my experience with in-person therapy, the most frustrating thing about starting with a new therapist is that it can take a few sessions to get them up to speed on the basics, and only after that do the sessions become helpful. They have you fill out a detailed questionnaire which helps with that, but there is no similarly detailed questionnaire on Betterhelp. So I'm already halfway through typing out basically an essay on the relavant details of my background and current situation to send to my counselor once I get Betterhelp up and running. I figure this is a good way to take advantage of the textual format to get my counselor up to speed quickly. However, I want to make sure my counselor gets compensated as fairly as possible for their time. If sending this wall of text instead of having a back and forth would negatively affect their pay, I don't want to do it. Does anyone know if that is the case? Or is there any other reason this is a bad idea?",15Jun2020,1

144,"Hello everyone!  
I am 27 years old and have the following problems: I got my master's degree in Sociology 2 years ago. Since then I have changed 2 jobs (in the profession) - I was a replacement for both jobs. I don't have a job at the moment, which is my biggest problem because I strive for success and business achievement, and due to various circumstances (but also myself), it is very difficult for me to achieve at the moment. In a month I am getting married and I feel like this is the worst period of my life. The boyfriend (future husband) is full of understanding and support for my daily mood swings. Mood swings had happened before, but to a lesser extent (probably because I had a job then, so it wasn’t some source of trouble). I’ve always been a bit introverted, so I guess that has something to do with the aforementioned problem as well. Also, a year ago I became a Ph.D. student in Sociology, which made me very happy at the time - but now I don't have the will for anything.    
Sometimes I feel completely incapable of everything and wonder who I am. As if I don’t recognize myself and as if I don’t have my real desires. I'm not sure how to explain it - but it's like I haven't found myself completely yet.  
 I am intensively looking for a job and trying to dedicate myself more to my doctoral dissertation, however, I find it very difficult to focus and concentrate, I am haunted by black thoughts (and sometimes even suicide) and I am very tired of these mood swings. There is also a big problem with the lack of self-confidence. I am happiest when I am with my few best friends, drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes.  
Do you think I should seek professional help or is this just a product of unemployment, wedding stress, etc.? Thank you in advance.",15Jun2020,1
145,"Hi - to keep short I’m going to brief and bullet point.

24, Female, lovely partner and family, ok friends, good salary (crap job), ED from 13 - 18 ish. Depression since 14 - now. (Sertraline since 18 - 24 200mg).

I am spiralling so bad right now.

- obsessed with my weight and how fat I am but just keep eating it’s all I talk about. (I’m 11st 3 5’6) so technically not overweight but I look it. 
- work is full of pressure following loads of furloughs and covering all their work
- constantly thinking my partner doesn’t want to be with me/thinks I’m fat/is going to leave me 
- constantly thinking I’m annoying my friends, partner and family because I voice the above 
- random hyper happy moments that I wish I could keep but I go rock bottom straight away
- 0 motivation
- slight suicidal thoughts, I want to be out my head
- thoughts of car crashes and fast deaths 
- dreams of death 

With all these things I’m pushing everyone away, yet I don’t want to be alone and my thoughts are so horrible all the time. Is this normal?? I haven’t spiralled like this as far as I remember.

147,"As a kid I used to look at security guards in malls and airports and often wonder, why do they even bother to look - they never seem to find anything. Their entire work-day consists of frisking people and their baggage. Perhaps they even secretly wish they'd find something dangerous one day - just to have one exciting day at work for a change, and more importantly to feel that their job has a point. But the reality is that it's a million to one shot, and for most frisking guards, every day is more or less similar.

I overlooked a small detail back then. If for one day, or even one hour, there is no guard at the mall or airport, hundreds of lives would instantly be at risk. 

There are a great many important things in life we do everyday that may not seem glamorous or exciting, but save lives. This is the essence of mental health as well.

We are all like those security guards for people we care about. Instead of frisking, we ask them how they feel. Instead of asking them to throw away their bad feelings, we embrace them in spite of these feelings, and this acceptance helps these people accept themselves.

This is not a one-day job, nor is it a spy-thriller. It is mundane, like that of a security guard. About not liking their job. A person they like but doesn't like them back. Feeling lonely. It all may sound familiar to the one who is listening, and maybe sometimes a bit frustrating. But it means the world to the one who is sharing. Because you created what the security guards, our unsung heroes, create everyday.

148,"This sounds contradictory I know, but read further before answering, should you choose to reply.

I have been diagnosed as bipolar and high-functioning ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) since my freshman year of highschool (13-14 years old for those not familiar with United States education system). During my manic episodes, I am energetic, comedic, and try my hardest to make everyone around me laugh, as I enjoy the fun atmosphere of people having a good time. However, when I am having a depressive mood, I tend to withdraw, sometimes ignoring my phone and isolating myself from conversation and/or interaction. When isolation is not possible, I become extremely irate, and regrettably, provocatively combative.

I find certain topics will push me into a worse mood while experiencing a depressive episode, hence my distance. These topics will cause my mind to race ahead in conversation, predicting (at least, in my head) how the sensitive topic can cause an argument to erupt. Discussions are one thing, but raised voices and accusations are not a discussion.

Due to recent events, the topic of racism makes a frequent appearance. It infuriates me that in 2020, this needless bias is still present. What's worse is that this one topic can instantly switch me from manic to depressive. I try to change the topic, not to avoid the issue, but to keep myself and my behavior pleasant. I am vehemently against biases based on unavoidable conditions (race, gender, orientation, etc.), but when I try to change the conversation, I'm accused of being silent towards the cause, and by proxy, an uncaring privelaged white guy.

This is not the case at all.

So here is my compound question, as there are many parts:

1. Am I being selfish by avoiding the discussion, when it so often gets too heated?

2. How can I diffuse the situation without coming across as uncaring (as I care GREATLY about eliminating bias)?

3. How can I balance a triggering topic with my mental health/conditions?

I want to help, but in the CORRECT way. I want to change the opposition's mind, but not through bullying and oppression, as that is the cause we are fighting against.",15Jun2020,1

I've found myself with that ""mentally at the bottom of the barrel"" feeling, so I started watching videos to find some clue as to what's going on. Apparently my brain is tired of thinking so it does the only thing it knows to do: Think. In fact in response to the agony of thinking, it starts thinking so hard that I can't focus my attention on anything.

Usually whenever I do something that doesn't involve Reddit or gaming, my mind will simply take over and essentially spam me with an endless playlist of thoughts. Often it's imaginary conversations that I actually get caught up in - maybe I'm being accused of something, or maybe I'm explaining why I'm doing something the way I'm doing it (like, washing the dishes).

162,"I've been going through a lot lately and it's getting to the point where I can't handle it anymore.  I started leaving many online communities because of stress, and the addiction of technology.  Several years ago I even went back to using my Nokia phone (thank goodness it still has service!) and shelfed the smart phone, because it was getting pretty bad.  Since doing that, when outside the house my mental health was a lot better.  Not being compelled to check something, just living the life in front of me.  But when home it wasn't working because I'm at a computer, like right now.  Thing is, I'm not happy.  


I'm stressed, I have heart disease and heart failure and the stress is getting to the point where I really feel it (heart palpitations are harder and more severe).  


Thing is, it's also hard for me to ""let go"".  For example, when I switched to the Nokia again, I actually got harassed and picked on in public for using a 22 year old phone.  It didn't matter to them it was for my mental health, and it got to the point where I was embarrassed about it, and almost put my SIM back in the smart phone.  I resisted that and I'm glad.  But on the computer when home, it's just so hard not to sit in bed with a laptop.  So my idea was ""delete my accounts, then I can't use the service"".  But then we're back to the phase of 'hard to let go'.  I'm now feeling distance, and that I don't belong in this time frame.  It's 2020 and here I am getting off of technology, rather than going on it.  


Don't worry, I'm not suicidal.  While I wish I would just pass away in my sleep like my grandmother last week, I do want to live.  I want to improve, but I'm actually scared to do it, in fear of what others and my friends/family will think of *me*.

I just want to write down what I‘m feeling and I thought this place might be a good one since I‘m afraid of being judged from people I know if I told them, I just really want to tell someone...

Basically, I don‘t know what to do with my life anymore. I feel like I‘ve lost control and I find myself thinking I have anger issues. I‘m writing this post because I can‘t bring myself to really talk to anyone I know about what I‘m going through, my mother tends to unintentionally do something that aggrevates me and I tend to then just explode with emotions that mostly result in me being a real piece of shit towards her. It‘s gotten a lot worse lately as I‘ve physically attacked her twice in the past month (nothing real bad, a light kick against her shin or a slap against her arm because I just couldn’t do anything else and was really really frustrated). I don‘t know why I am like this and I really don‘t want to be, but in situations where I get frustrated I can‘t control my emotions/anger. I really don‘t want to be such an asshole but I can‘t help myself and afterwards I always cry in my room/sometimes harm myself... I tried to talk with my mother about all that stuff but she never accepts an apology and really often provokes me and laughs at me when all I want from her is to take me seriously (which then resolves in frustration on my side and it all starts over again...) 
This has been going on for years but has gotten especially bad lately and I think I know some of the reasons/things that may made me like this:

In the past year my mother has ‚bombarded‘ me with revelations about our family life. for example that I have an (half?)uncle I never knew about, that he has children who my grandpa seems to love a lot more than me (it‘s all really complicated but my grandpa‘s always been a hero to me since my parents divorced really early on and I just always felt unconditional love from him). She only recently told me that my father‘s bipolar (diagnosed) and that he used to threaten her a lot (with a gun once - our gun laws are pretty strict where I live), that the first words he said when I was born were ‚I hope she won‘t turn out like her brother‘, that my cat has cancer (she told me that a few days ago but has known it for weeks)... basically she always waited to tell me things and it‘s just been a LOT to process in a short amount of time. I think she now tells me these things because I turned 18 earlier this year. It‘s just a lot and I‘m kind of upset because she never told me these things that seem like pretty important information to me.

I‘ve also always struggled with my weight/confidence (I was pretty skinny until ~half a year ago but always felt fat) and it doesn‘t help that my mother tells me I can‘t wear shorts in summer and that I shouldn‘t wear bikinis, that I need to lose weight etc... I‘ve gained a lot of weight while being in my first relationship which ended about 2 weeks ago and I‘ve already lost a few pounds... (I broke up with my s/o because I felt like I wasn‘t mentally stable enough to be in a relationship that needed a lot of time and that I need to focus on improving my own life)

I‘ve been crying a lot. Isolating myself in a way... I also developed a really bad fear of/in the dark and I can‘t sleep through the night.

I feel like I really should go see a therapist but I can‘t bring myself to do it. This might sound pretty stupid, but I don‘t want to have it ‚validated‘ that my problems are my own fault and that I have to change in order to make other people‘s lives with me easier. The thought of me being the way I am being the problem really frustrates me and I can‘t accept that to be honest...

I’m trying to end it for good. For all my life, I’ve been always haunted by too much of it.

   I often find myself judging my worth based off of the difficulties that I have experienced in my life, the trials and tribulations I have been through, or just how shitty my life has been in general. I feel oddly validated by negative experiences, like they make me more of a person, regardless of if I handled them well or not.

   At the same time, I frequently write off the experiences I have had as not being 'bad' enough, or myself off as not having 'suffered' enough to really matter. As this is (for some reason) tied to myself worth, it becomes a way to tear myself down. An example of this thought process might be, 
   ""Oh, getting assaulted at a young age didn't really effect me/wasn't that bad. I haven't really suffered enough to matter. My life has been too easy.""

   I am not writing this as an attempt to invalidate anyone's experiences, or create a narrative in which I am the pinnacle of human suffering, obviously other people have had comparatively worse lives than me with less privileges. I'm just trying to express that I often feel validated by my negative experiences while simultaneously trying to invalidate those instances in my head or find a reason for why they are just my fault.

   My question is, does anyone experience something akin to this? And is there an easy word or descriptor for these feelings, like there is for anxiety?

173,"Im in a situation where my employer knew i had mental problems and i disclosed that i was Bi-Polar,  ADHD, General Anxiety and General Depressive...  they also knew that i was on probation for losing it during manic episode and busting a large window downtown.

long story short they cut me off unemployment for not going back to work during the pandemic that had me in a constant state of fear and anxiety.   for me and my family's health and safety.   then i went broke and it got much worse but i endured until post lock-down and had no choice but to return to employment..

worked 3 days but was a wreck and there was an array of disputes over pay and the company still dumping 100s of gallons of chemical waste water into waterways which i complained about for months.  caustic hazardous chemical degreaser and grease water.

i did the math based on how many trucks they have and they probably dump about 750,000 to 1,000,000 gallons a year.

eventually i begged to be terminated and allowed to collect unemployment and didn't want to continue being forced to do illegal things.   but they just responded with pressure for me to resign

i was bullied for a year by my lead tech because im passive and have no middle ground..  either calm or explode.   so i did half his work..  the bullying and there was widespread discrimination, tokenism and favoritism.  white people were favorite followed by blacks and most hated was this small trans boy who the bigot production manager would assign the hardest, lowest paying work and constantly demoted..   anybody who worked with this person shared in his pain so it was the elephant in the room.

when i worked with him the manager harassed me on a daily basis and was angry about any little thing he could find because thats how much he hated this trans boy.

i raised all of these issues and just wanted a financial cushion to transition to next employer.

they tried to force me to resign by gas-lighting me, railroading me, steamrolling me,  ignoring my complaints and even resorted to lying in the termination letter.

eventually this 2 day battle sent me into a manic episode and ultimately i lost it on co worker who bullied me and production manager and told them off and stood up to them for bullying me and a trans boy thats cool af and less than half their size and told them if they didnt like what i had to say id meet them half way and i was fired 5 minutes later.

i lost all claim to unemployment, wrongful termination, everything.

do i have any recourse for discrimination against mentally ill?

i have none in discrimination retaliation because my termination overrules i think?or whisleblower retaliation.

i blew it...

they are monsters.

its not right and if i have to be the victim then so be it.

if all legal recourse is lost and all i got is my story then im going to tell my story.

and if i have to write petitions and go after their major accounts publicly one by one from the top down then so be it.

they can sue me if they want they made sure i have nothing to take and they made sure of that.

m not doing to good right now but **FIRST** when i have the **ENERGY** im going to write petitions **FIRST** then talk to different groups about contacting them directly

Civil rights activists, eco-activists, bullying awareness, mental health awareness, anti-discrimination.  and just about everyone else who isn't a piece of shit could be a potential signature/person who would take the time to write.

is it a lost cause or should i stand up to these people for myself and all the others they have screwed over?

they exploited my mental illness to pressure me into actions that they could fire me for and im not doing too well.  just isn't right.

they bully trans boys and hold black people back from promotions/raises.   they only hire enough minorities to not look like the racists they are.   i even saw a guy try to fight a trans boy 1/3 of his size!!!

im not doing too good right now and spiraling and probably heading into the hospital ive somehow managed to stay out of up to this point.

175,"hi. this is going to be some venting. 

 i feel stressed and stuck on what to do. my mother has said things like ""peace when i stop breathing,"" ""god please take my life,"" and directly telling me that if she were dying to not give her medication or to save her life but to let her go so she wouldn't be a burden. 

im stressed. i know she needs help but i dont know how to talk to her. ive never really talked about things mental health wise because its hard for me to open up to my family or parents that way. idk why but i fear our relationship might change negatively afterwards for some reason. hence why they dont know about how i actually feel on the inside. 

there was some commotion today, which resulted me in smashing some piece of glass on the floor and stomping out of the house as i had a mental breakdown. i needed space and privacy as i have none of that at home (i dont have my own room or anything.) ive had suicidal ideation for a very long time, though I somehow managed it. but today i completely broke and now im thinking strongly of it. for a second there i finally considered confessing how i felt to my family but then i ultimately turned it down. 

my mother texted me, begging me to come back home and that her worry will cause problems for her heart (she has heart problems) which made me feel even worse. i dont want to lose my mom ever. 

she isn't a perfect mom. she's done things that i feel like have caused some type of trauma to me growing up, but shes gotten better over the years (altho she can still be a bit harsh at times) and shes provided a lot im grateful for. but i feel like because of the way i grew up, it makes it very hard to actually talk to her and be close. 

i just turned 18 this year and i was excited for college and all of that but i feel like letting go of all my dreams and everything. and with everything going on in the world, its harder to look at the bright side of things too. 

sorry this is long. but if you could provide any advice, i would greatly appreciate it.",15Jun2020,1

178,"I’ve been not okay for a long time now. I am in grade 12 and these last 2 years had a huge toll on my mental health. Till grade 10 I was always the “funny guy” of my class. I was popular I had a lot of friends. When i got into grade 11, I changed schools. I went to a school in which attendance isn’t mandatory so I could attend coaching classes(Its normal in my country). 

There, everyone was so different than I am (I’d rather not go into details but most of them didnt even speak english) I never could connect with anyone  so I felt lonely....I went to my old friends for comfort and I realised *people had expectations that I’d make them laugh* and joke around being the “fun guy”. All they want is me to keep them happy and they don’t like it when I’m down. For company sake I still hung out with them pretending to be the same funny guy but I felt it was forced earlier it was natural. 

Now, I have noone not even my parents to just listen ti how much internal pain I am in. I cry in the shower, alone on the terrace at night knowing noone cares. The girl whose life I basically saved after her nudes got leaked stopped answering my texts after I told her I am not okay mentally. 

Theres this void in my heart i just wanna fill. Whether it be by opening to a confidant or with a knife. I dont think I can go on living like this anymore....and the sad part is I have noone to tell this to. Please someone help me I cant feel like this anymore.",15Jun2020,2

My depression is relatively new, my partner sort of knows what kind of depressive symptoms I have, but not all of it.

Recently I started getting suicidal thoughts. My therapist knows and I discuss this with her, and I also know which hotlines to call if I ever need to. However I'm not sure if I should share these thoughts with my partner. On the one hand I feel like I want to share it, but on the other hand I'm worried that it will cause him too much (unneccesary) distress.

181,"A stranger had non consensual sex with me while I was drinking. I was 19 and he was 30. He took me off the streets, brought me back to his place, and did this:
Bit me
Photographed me
Suffocated me
Held me in the room with him for hours
Continued to have sex with me after I was bleeding 
Forced me to sing for him
Screamed at me when I tried to leave 
Smirked and looked smug the whole time
Forced me to say things to him during the sexual parts
This was my first time having sex 

I managed to get away by waiting until he fell asleep and ran to the door. 
I showered and cried. 
I dropped out of college after this and developed PTSD.

184,"So angry. I’ve been really sick the past few months. Doctors are looking at a possible neurologic disorder. 

Last month, I went to urgent care because I was really exhausted and weak. They took one look at me and sent me to the ER. The ER doc took one look at my meds (mainly basic stuff like high blood pressure meds, etc...and two antidepressants). Immediately he started running tests for drug overdoses. I also got a chest X-ray for some unknown reason. He never once asked about my symptoms. Never had a conversation with me. He actually didn’t say a word to me except to tell me his name. I was basically just laying on the gurney with my eyes closed, too exhausted to do much more than say yes or no. 

Suddenly he popped his head in the room, told my husband I was fine and should take “vitamins and supplements,” and that we could go. The nurse handed us a few papers, and they hurried us out the the door. 

As we drove away, I looked at the paperwork. You know what his diagnosis was? A bipolar mixed episode. I don’t even have bipolar disorder!

I submitted a formal complaint and just got the response back—that even though the doctor couldn’t find evidence of a psychiatric condition, he felt strongly that my chronic psychiatric history (i.e., depression and PTSD) caused my fatigue. 

And now I’m in a wheelchair. Maybe if that doctor had done his job and looked for something beyond a psych issue I would be walking now.",15Jun2020,2

that being said, she is worsening my health every day
my mom is the kimd of person that is morlstly fpcused om herself. she doesnr care what others think of her and doesnt care much for others feelings.
lately, sinxe avout last september, things have been hard for her at work. she is angry and stressed and takes it out on me. she yells at me at least once every day, always nitpicks on everything, and she always finds something that i did wrong and yells at me for it for hours. then, shes passive aggressive amd doesnt want to talk to me. then, she comes to me and doesnt even apolpgise, just says 'i dont wanna yell at you, bit things are hard for me, you have to understand' and leaves. she calls me a disappointment, and says im ungrateful and says things like 'well do you pay me for taking care of you?, and makes me feel guilty about evem existing in her presence and living in her home, even yho im 17 and cant move out, even tho i want to. she dpes this evwryday, 24/7, unless im at my fiances, whete she doesnt have control over me, thankfully. she threatens me, for example once she said shes tnrow put my cats if i fifnt do what she said. shes very hypocritical, she doesnt do much at home and wants me and dad to do everything, and her only excise is 'im tired from work', when my dad has even more wprk and has severe back issues. she treats us like trash and then wonders why i dont want to be around her. she makes herself put to be the victim, and o cant talk back because she would be even angrier. at this point, im worried she might start getting physical.
i am diagnosed with clinical depressipn, an anxiety disorder and possibly ptsd (ive been to a doctor with it and i have a therapist, but i havent been diagnosed yet or anything, but i have been through a very traumatic even at the age of 11) so this isnt helping me at all, plus i have a very bad immune system and when i feel terriblr and depressed, i take worse care of myself, so therefore i am more sick, and therefpre she is angry again.
i feel the need to avoif her at all costs. its so hard to please her. every time i ipen my mouth, its wrong. so i avoid her as much as possible, which means i stay out of the hpuse a lot and stay at my fiances, so i dont see my dad much either unfortunately, but he is great anf i love him dearly
i hate her, but i love her. i am absolutely tereified of her at this point, and just thinking about being around her makes me tear up

My mom is 2 times cancer survivor and she was diagnosed with cancer again in Dec 2019. I wasn't here for here very much for previous two times as I was in college, but I suspect my problems began at that time. My mom and my dad don't get along. They have completely different ideologies and just refuse to agree. Both of them confide in me and my sister for problems they have with each other, but my mom does it more than my dad.

Its very difficult for me to explain them that the other one doesn't mean anything bad of whatever they said. This new cancer has been especially problematic because some medicine induced depression in my mom, and now she's having depression and anxiety attacks, and she's very bitter about my dad and it's very exhausting for me to handle. 4 days ago she was tested positive for COVID-19, and my dad wants her to be in complete isolation for 2 weeks, but as she was tested randomly and doesn't have any symptoms, she, my sister and and I are convinced that she doesn't need to be completely isolated etc. now again she and my dad are fighting and she ends up crying and there's no one except me to give her some support. my sister seems to have sort of given up and doesn't take her too seriously now a days.

I've noticed that now I have continuous anxiety whenever things are not ""happy"" between everyone in my family, and I take it upon myself to rectify them, but they seem out of my hands at times and I keep feeling bad for it. I don't know, maybe I feel some guilt, maybe I feel its my responsibility to keep my family happy, its weird. I try to never get angry, but whenever I do, there's no one I can go to, my family doesn't provide me any emotional support when am sad or angry, instead they get angry at me for not understanding. I just feel so crappy all the time and afraid that things might go wrong any moment if my parents talk and my delicate balance which I just established will break.

I'm always jealous of my friends, who can be carefree and focus on their passions and careers, while I focus only on my family. 

My professional life is suffering too. I used to be above average in office at my tasks, but I've lately been just mediocre.

Those going for counselling services are usually for individuals who are already at their breaking point and have serious issues that are clearly visible and are at a high risk of physical harm. Hence, anyone going for these types of services are usually shun on by most people.

Currently, I am at a dilemma. I have been incredibly demotivated lately to the point where when I close my eyes, all I see is darkness. I can’t even picture how I want my future to be like. I’m about to graduate from university and I can’t imagine how my career would be like. I can’t comprehend having to move on from being single to (potentially) having to spend the rest of my life with someone who’s a complete stranger to me. These are some of the many thoughts circulating in my head but basically, I’ve felt numb and blank to have the drive to do anything anymore. 

So, my question is, would it be appropriate for me to seek counselling services?

Few years back I wanted to be in a relationship with a girl. She didn't want to be in realtionship with me stating she didn't want to be in a realtionship then, I think I was being a fool n thought she might change her mind later n MIGHT be in a realtionship with me. She stayed a friend, I lost touch for a while bt later when i could talk to her i stayed in touch with her regularly in hopes she might accept me. We used to chat frequently, she made it look like she's also an introvert like me and i was the only one whos in regular contact with her n told i was a grt friend to her. Obviously this made my feelings for her more strong. But after few mre months like this with regular chatting etc. she showed less interest to talk with me, initially i thought she was busy but after repeated incidents like this i wanted to get some closure. All this time i was losing contact with the world around me n became more n more introverted. When asked would she be in relationship with me she told she dint want to yet or she never might, after this it looked like shes started avoiding me one fine day i told i cant be a friend like this. She won't be in a realtionship with me and shes not even treating me as a good friend like she claimed. That hurted more than she saying she dint want to be in relationship. It's been few months since i stoppped talking to her but yet every now n then I think of situations where she's with me, how i could handle things differently where she mightve accepted to be with me. 

I know there's no fault of her, but it looked like a toxic friendship. I was giving her way too much attention and affection n getting nothing in return. I know its better to stay away from her for me but I am in denial. I still think everything might get better if I try or she might only patch things. 

I don't even know what to expect from others from then, I feel hollow without feeling any connection with people trying to minimize social contact with minimal friends.

I am trying to get out of this denial and improve myself. These constant thoughts are filling me up with emotion i cant handle. It's hurting n I choking me. I have lost interest in parties, shopping etc. I feel like I don't know myself. I don't know what I'll get from you guys but i wanted to share these feelings n let some burden of off me which is choking me constantly increasing with thoughts i am having. I've never let anyone close to me like I let her n now I dont have anyone to share these things with.

This might look silly to many of you but all these things with her were very serious to me. I don't even know if my problem is a serious thing to be considered bt I am letting this out, hoping to get better.

TIA for any suggestions u might give, its even okay if there r no suggestions just reading my problem is more than enough.",15Jun2020,1
210,"I'm 19. I barely have a job. I'm pretty introverted lonely person. I'm stuck doing drugs to at least numb the fact that I have hit rock bottom. I'm still living in my parent's house. The coronavirus makes it hard to go outside. I am a very anxious person nowadays. I can't even work without wanting to lose my shit.

I rarely talk to people as well. I'm becoming more asocial. Sometimes, I don't even want to socialize even with family. I feel like they don't get my sense of anything. I feel like i'm ok being a little lonely but at the same time I don't want to be more isolated. The isolation kills me, it gets me more paranoid. As I sometimes hear chatters through walls or thinking that my parents are up to something evil. So unsure with people at times. I get delusional. I don't wanna talk. You are part of something malicious. You are going to conspire something against me. Punk! I watch the news and sometimes I feel like I can predict what's going to happen next sometimes. I think of something and boom it happens. I mix other celebrities death to predict something severe to happen. IT has happened! It's crazy! Words are useless, fuck communication. I can read your thoughts. I can read them. I can hear your weird shit. The weird chatters, the dysfunctional reality. I can see all of it.    

I just dropped out of this technical college because i'm stupid like that. I don't like to be near people anymore. I get paranoid that I smell bad and I shower almost everyday. Any day. I also don't like asking for help for some reason. I'm becoming even more lazy. 

I hate playing this game of duck,duck, therapist. I keep having to go find another one after the one I had didn't help at all. The usual bullshit question, ""did you take your medication."" I just wanted to reply with, ""Yes, Ms. Ratched. I take my medication."" Blah, blah, blah. I spill my guts and they are just shocked. She would usually reply with, ""wow, that's sad"" or just something you would hear if you told some random stranger. So, I was like fuck this. Just drop this. I need another therapist.

I have been drinking lately, daytime too. My only friend asks why I drink during daytime. I just replied with, ""because fuck it."" My intrusive thoughts are just gone when i'm drinking and that's not a good thing because it promotes alcoholism, which i'm probably prone to due to the fact that I had uncles who were severe alcoholics. My dad wasn't, thankfully. Not only that, I will use any drug to escape at this point. I'm thinking codeine tonight. The intrusive thoughts murder me every time, feeling all guilty as hell thinking fucked up shit. But when I just drink, boom. It's all gone. But it's all wrong. Alcohol is bad for me. I have been also gaming and binge watching Youtube videos for the past week. It's just not worth it anymore. At this point, it's just to get by the days. Medication just seems like a way to numb everything. Literally everything. My feelings are just gone at this point. The only thing I shit out is a normal sedation feel. I was on antipsychotics but it made me boring. I would also drink during those times. Bad idea. First week of withdrawals were fucking hell. Nausea like a motherfucker. Hot flashes every day. 

I daydream a lot. I like to live in a fantasy land. I don't even talk when i'm in those thoughts. I dissociate severely almost to the point of not even moving at all. I just ignore everything around me, just deeply concentrating in these thoughts. I went camping 2 weeks ago and I rarely talked. I was too busy in my own world. I did however had fun, I went through puddles with my sister and cousin while driving a 4 wheeler. I just really need to stop being so deep inside a reality that seems to be distracting my actual place I am living in.

I wanna work at a better job, I have been applying but no one's wants to hire me. Interview, after interview. 

I still have a little bit of optimism. I feel like I can still get the fuck out of this numbing place. Fuck this feeling of depression bullfuck. It's retarded. I hate depression, I hate it. It makes me feel like a little bitch. I just want to kill myself in the Walmart bathroom. I'd do it with a big ass shotgun too. Blast my brains in the wall. But I don't wanna do that. I wanna be a crazy guy with crazy muscles! I wanna work out and shit. It can sure as hell make me look good! Fuck it though. I'm a skinny bastard. I can a fit body! Maybe have a girlfriend. Nah. I'd be fine just being alone. I don't want intimacy anymore. I think it's a waste of time now. I like being alone and I don't have to worry to be fair. I'm already a broken human being. That's why all the women I had a ""thing"" with always end up gone and honestly it's probably for the best. I also hope to get a good paying job to, so I can get out of my parent's house. I'm also hoping to be productive as well. I have been a lazy fucker lately. I need to get out more too or maybe not.",15Jun2020,1

212,"We have a million thoughts that make us feel we're not okay. 
There are times we want to say so much but we can't. 
There are a lot of struggles behind those smiles you see everyday. 
There are a lot of times we wish our own thoughts made sense to us. 
There are times we wish someone would listen, not judge.
There are times all we want is a shoulder to lean on, to cry and scream.

214,"TL; DR: Describe your current environment in great detail for me. Do not describe anything with good or bad labels or whether you like/dislike it. You may describe feelings and levels of comfort/your demeanor and clothing. What are you sitting on/standing near? What sounds are around you? What is the lighting like? Are there any other people in the space? What color are the walls? Etc... 

I occasionally send this exercise to friends asking out of curiosity being honest that it’s a simple thought exercise and most of them find no one asks them things like this especially with 0 pressure to seem put together or “productive.” 

I usually offer mine first so they can see there’s no judgment. It can be as long or as short as you observe. I’m curious to read about your real time stimuli processing. 

————————————

My real-time example if you’re interested: 

I am alone at the moment and my nose whistles quietly every time I breathe in. 
I’m wearing pajamas and I feel comfortable in them. I have several journals sprawled around a red fainting couch. They all serve different purposes and I am scribbling my racing thoughts/ideas in them periodically. 

The walls vibrate when a truck drives past and I can feel the ground shake. The lighting is warm, coming from sconces on the walls. Sometimes I can hear the building creak. This building is old. The walls are cream colored and the wood trim is dark oak. There are cracks running from floor to ceiling. The window is open so I can feel a cool breeze coming in and I hear birds singing “chicka deedeedee”. A lot of the trees around here have those seed pods we call “Helicopters” that spin to the ground much to the delight of squirrels who catch them and run off to bury their treasures. 

I am in my bedroom. I separated my clean laundry and it’s on the floor waiting to be put away. I’m drinking cold coffee that was warm around 40 minutes ago. My hair is pulled into the messiest bun imaginable and my right eyebrow is itchy. My toes are kind of cold and I feel like I’m about to fall asleep. Speaking of falling asleep, my right arm is about to go numb from leaning on it for so long and I’ve begun to slouch. My shoulders ache because I just realized I’ve been tensing them up. On that note I’ve also been clenching my jaw, so I relax them. 
I’m curled up with my legs tucked in on the aforementioned red fainting couch. It has flowers and paisley patterns weaved into the fabric (subtle). Here and there a melody will pop into my head and I’ll find myself humming a tune aloud. 

Occasionally I can hear my partner in the other room crack their wrists or move about.

—————————
Final notes: 

As someone with cptsd I am eager to capture these moments of objective reality and not put so many expectations on myself. I’ve had a pretty serious journaling habit for a few years now. I felt silly at first but then I realized just how much it would make me smile looking back if I was completely honest with myself and didn’t only write about the negatives. I oftentimes live inside my head so I have been practicing grounding myself in the real world as often as I can.",15Jun2020,1
215,"Hi, 

I'm sharing my story with the hopes that someone will read it and offer some help. I cannot afford therapy but I really need to vent somewhere.

I grew up with 2 older siblings in a dysfunctionnal family. My parents had me quite late, my mum is 72, my dad 66 and I am 25. 

Both my parents were authoritarian and old-school in their way of raising us. Mum was staying at home raising the kids, Dad provided for the family. My older brother, the eldest, was not expected to help with housekeeping, but me and my sister were. My older brother's interest in sciences was encouraged and he taught by my dad how to fix things while my mum forced me and my sister to cross stitch and read books. 

They've always demanded the utmost respect for themselves and for the education they were providing us. As kids, we had to keep silent while sat at the dining table or while playing. To this day they have many rules in the house that we need to respect when visiting especially us daughters. Many of these are hypocritical such as not interrupting, when they interrupt us constantly. I am left handed, they forced me to write with my right hand but were unsuccessful.

Since very young I remember my dad getting into insane outbursts of anger where he would smash absolutely everything and everyone standing on his way. Home was normally very quiet with  few visitors, my parents having nearly no friends, so it was a huge contrast. To this day my heart starts beating really fast if I hear something accidentally break or a loud noise at my parent's house. Loudness always meant bad things were coming. My dad's rage was not directed at us kids for misbehaving, but we definitely avoided making him angry. Although he would beat us for the smallest thing, for example I remember one day being held upside down by one leg when I was 8. I'd always pee myself if he was approaching me when angry.

My mum was actually worse, but it took me many years to come to the realisation. She'd beat us not just to discipline us but also when she was in a bad mood. My brother took a lot less beatings than me and my sister. She broke objects on our heads, pull us throughout the corridor by our hair. She would not accept that we show sadness or anger. I once asked her when I was 6 and she was beating us to have mercy and stop, she made fun of me and kept going harder. She once nearly strangled my sister out of frustration about an event exterior to our home. 

We grew up thinking we were horrible kids, that we were tormenting our mum, so we constantly walked on eggshells and tried anything to please her. And she took this to her advantage. We were still very young when she was telling us all about her problems and how horrible Dad was to her, how dared he hit her, her step-family being mean to her. So we sided with her and we started disliking Dad, on my side at least I was hating him as a child and teenager because I thought he was a monster. Dad is also quite introverted and never shows affection, so alongside the education we were receiving it was easy to think so. My mum always denied knowing why my Dad would get angry, I know guess she must have been ""responsible"" but was in total denial.

Asking for help to other adults was nearly impossible as we relied on our parents, we were scared to think that they were not perfect. I once vented at the school's infirmary when I was 13, who then called my mum to talk about it. My mum got mad and chopped off my hair to a hideous, way too short bob. At that point I felt so humiliated and down that I seriously considered suicide.

My mum insisted to have an African grey parrot when I was still small. But she had zero empathy or patience with him when these parrots actually need a lot of work and care. Having an african grey is pretty much like having a 3 year old who never grows up. So she'd beat him with a spoon or yell at him almost every day for his ""bad behaviour""

The worst part is that to this day they still believe that they were right and that this upbringing was the best thing they could do for us. I can understand that they are repeating what they were taught but it is difficult for me to forgive them. I have so many issues today in my adult life that stem from this education.

It's hard especially because my mum NEVER admits her wrongs. Which is why I have to bend to her will as trying to calmly argue makes her go mad. She is very good at playing the victim instead of taking responsibility for something. She is also incredibly immature. I have spent now 8 years away from home, coming back twice a year, and have grown into a young and mature adult (for the most part). 

And I am shocked to realise how immature my mum is. She pouts, gives the silent treatment, get upset for the smallest thing like a door not shut or the cat meowing. If that happens you'll hear her yell from the other side of the house and that gives me and my sister so much anxiety and worry. She criticises everyone but herself on a constant basis. My Dad gives in to her behaviour, and she manipulates him and makes sure her views become the family truth. To this day she singles my sister out as the lazy, fat and unintelligent kid (when none of this is true or justified) and coopts me and my brother. My mum manipulates everyone to revolve the attention around her. She has always made my sister feel ""less than"". My sister is able to see the truth but does not want to talk about it. She craves love from my parents and wants them in her life.

My brother is a replica of my parents. He adopted the same authoriarian behaviour and it is impossible to have a normal discussion with him. He is in total denial of your feelings or thoughts if they do not ressemble his. My parents enable his behaviour and allow him to hit me or my sister or call us foul names, and to this day have a preference for him despite his constant gross behaviour.

Sometimes I feel like going crazy because my sister tries to forget as much as she can and my brother never experienced the same childhood. I have no one to talk to about it. I cannot afford therapy and this is a really heavy story to tell friends. I'm not sure what relationship to have with my parents as unlike my sister I am more rebellious. I cannot fake it around people I dislike. For the last 5 years I have tried everything I could to please my parents with my own time, money and energy but they have not changed. The family has stayed the same and is still just as dysfunctional no matter how much we pretend otherwise.",15Jun2020,1

Hi,
I’ve been scrolling this sub and I think I relate to many things. I’m 25 M. 
Here are the things I noticed about myself:

1- I started going to gym to build up my body but left after 2 months or so. And this happened multiple times. I have joined the gym maybe 5-6 times and left after a month or two.

2- I started learning python(computer coding language) but lost interest after 2-3 lectures. Left it. Started it again some time ago but left it again after 2-3 lectures again.

3 started learning guitar in university was able to play some basic tunes. And it was like learn a tune leave for a month and then again learn a tune and leave for a month. Can’t build a routine to learn it.

4- Half assed my way through university but passed with a average GPA.

5- I have small bursts of energy that make me want to start a blog, learn about cars, learn about electronics but it fades away quickly when I get into it.

6- I have never been consistent in anything in all my life. I scored above average marks till university but then dropped to a average student.


7- Read a total of 1 book(non-curricular )in my life. Struggling to read another. Started a book maybe 3 months ago still haven’t finished it, today I started reading it again and I know if anything else comes up I will leave it too and maybe pick it up again after months when I have that burst of motivation.

I don’t know about this post and I think its structurally weak because I may have half assed it too.

218,"At the start of last year (2019), I was put on Antidepressants to treat my anxiety. Never did I imagine myself having to be put on medication for my mental health. It took me a while to figure out what ultimately led me to that point. 

Looking back, it was likely a culmination of factors. Being away from my family, a new living environment, stress, lack of sleep, self-consciousness, and maybe a bit of genetics. The thought of being tethered to the medication for the rest of my life really bothered me. I had this feeling that as long as I kept taking it, I would never feel or be myself, or I would be perceived by others as weak, or emotionally unstable. 

But after some time to really assess my circumstances, I was able to shift from the perspective of “why is this happening to me,” to “how can I use this to my advantage.” 

I introduced myself to a variety of things like reading, journaling, podcasts, supplementation, and eating a healthy diet. And more recently, I’ve discovered the amazing benefits of meditation and cold water immersion. 

After months of commitment to these practices, I’ve been able to come off the medication, and can confidently say, I’ve never felt better! 

I really wish you guys all the strength to get through whatever mental health struggles you may be going through❤️ let me know if you are in the same boat, and maybe I can assist you in someway.🙏🏽

growing up i was never taught how to cope. i was sexually abused at 6 and my family thought they were helping me by pretending it didn’t happen so from a young age i was taught very unhealthy ways to self soothe. i excessively smoke weed, i used to have a major adderall addiction and even turn to drinking sometimes to make myself feel better (this is very rare but still used to cope).

I have a girlfriend now, but things aren’t well. I’m going to college only 40 minutes away, and I’m dorming because my family situation isn’t always healthy, she isn’t for the semester because money. And I have tons of financial aid so I can. And it’s upsetting her because she thinks I’m going to move on. And I am not good looking, skinny, and I’m a ball of depression inside. So her giving up hope (we’ve been dating for about a year and a half) is just sending my mental all over the place and landing on suicidal thoughts. 

And she has every right to not have hope, I haven’t treated her as well as I should in the past, but I feel like I have explained my situation and want to get away from my family enough for her to understand.

227,"I just finished a yelling match basically that went on for multiple hours and all my dad has to say is that I'm a disrespectful child, and that I need to worry about my own health before I fix anyone else, that I'm broken and messed up and have no business trying to fix anyone other than myself. He's so mean and cruel he yelled at me like I wasn't even his daughter. I cried and spoke through the tears and nothing. It's like I was talking to a wall. 

I know how bad it is to try to advocate for sensitive issues, especially family issues, but I'm so tired of us just tolerating each other that I almost don't care what happens to me. My dad can lash out all he wants and say terrible things but I told myself that it'd be okay as long as it got through to him. But I was wrong and I don't know what to do. I'm panicking because it's all so much and I honestly want to just end it all right now but I know that'd only be the easy way out for me. But then I think that maybe I deserve to be selfish and just escape however I can. 

They say the best revenge is to make it (he said I'm just like my mother and 50 years from now I'll be screwed up) but I'm just so tired. I don't want to make it anymore. I'm sure I'll get replies about how I walked into that but I really want us to get better. It's too toxic.

I crave control and want to know what will happen before it happens. I’ve resorted to tarot cards and coincidences to tell me the future since I can’t predict it myself. I know I need therapy, I rehearse what id say in my head every time I’m sad. But every time I get a chance to go, I tell myself I’m fine and don’t need to talk. If I just get more medication all my problems will fix themselves. I can’t reach out to my friends, I’m too annoying, they’ll reach out to me.

230,"Hello! I’m a 17 year old looking for some advice. I don’t know what wrong with me. I’ve been to therapy and everything. Even to the mental hospital but no one can pinpoint what is wrong. My mom doesn’t believe anything is wrong with me, and she tells my doctors and therapists this, so they have already dismissed me when I walk through the door. Here are some of the things I deal with and my concerns in list form for convenience. If anyone has ANY input, I would be more than thankful.

1. I can’t remember anything from my childhood. Or what happened 3 seconds ago. Everything feels like a dream and like I’m watching myself from far away.

2. I have gaps in my memory sometimes. Where everything is just black, or I know I did something but can’t remember doing it fully.

3. I dissociate REALLY bad and have been for months. I haven’t felt at the front of my head since last September. It had completely destroyed my grades and relationships with people. Whenever I think about what’s wrong with me (like rn) I get super dissociated and go into autopilot. It’s hard to type. This also happens when something stressful happens or someone talks to me. I have to actively fight to stay in the present and not get pushed back.

4. I hear voices sometimes. About once a month. I started writing them down while in the mental hospital. Keep in mind, these aren’t like thoughts. They are loud. They are obviously coming from my head, so I’m not hearing them, but my brain processes them like I’m hearing them if that makes sense. Here are my notes 

  *females voice, calm but disappointed tone* *in left ear mostly kinda surround sound* “everything is failing”

*whisper female voice, about my age, soothing and deeper than mine. Right next to my right ear* “hey”

*call of duty guy voice* *intercom noise* ——- inbound! Get down! 

*while I was laughing my ass off* *deep mans voice whispering* “what..the fuck”

*female voice open mouth gasp* (right ear)

5. I panic and go into delusions sometimes. My mom wasn’t home one time when I woke up. I spam called her and my sister and neither answered. I started panicking and thinking they were both dead and had been dead, but I just imagined them being alive and my neighbors were watching me panic feeling bad for me bc they knew I was delusional and lost my mom. My mom and sister were fine. 

6. Sometimes I’ll wake up in the middle of the night and be really unfamiliar with my surroundings, even though I’ve lived here for quite some time. This also sometimes happens in places I’m familiar with.


I’m sure there are some things I’ve missed. I just want someone’s input to maybe name of the of these things if they have names, or maybe having someone say they deal with the same thing and know what it is. I just want some insight. I’m not necessarily looking for a diagnosis on reddit, but if this sounds like anything you know of I would love that hear it and look into it. It might help me find what I need. I just feel helpless and stuck.
And if anyone is curious, I have been diagnosed with ADHD, C-PTSD, GAD, and MDD by the mental hospital I was in. I was tested for none of these and I was only there 2 weeks.",15Jun2020,1
231,"For the past two months or so, I have just been feeling like I'm in a downward spiral. I've been having such ups and downs lately that I feel like I'm going insane.

My boyfriend doesn't understand what mental illness is like so he gets frustrated and when I talk to him about it he says ""I just don't know how to fix it"" and he says that's why he gets frustrated. I'm on medication for Bipolar and Anxiety, taking Lamotrigine and Hydrxyxine. It just doesn't feel like anything is working or helping. I try so hard to have a good mindset but it just demolishes itself throughout the day. I feel like no one understands at all what I'm going through and that everyone just thinks that I'm lazy and don't want to do anything. When I get anxiety episodes it's like I snap at my mom or my brother and they are the only ones that see that side of me directed to them. I hate myself for what I've become and I don't know what to do anymore. I cry almost every day about anything and everything and I get so angry about nothing.

236,"**throwaway account ***

I’m obsessed with a girl I’ve never met or talked to. So, last year this girl was in my college class, she was always the one the professor would call on, and she would always know the answer. I really didn’t notice her until half way through the semester. But I believe her intelligence is what made me notice/become obsessed with her. She is also very pretty. 

Being an introvert I never made an attempt to talk to her or anything like that. I have only seen her one other time (last semester), but for some reason I can’t get over her. I obviously know this is very bad, but I can’t stop thinking about her. Maybe I regret not talking to her?  Or maybe I need a therapist. I do have bad anxiety which doesn’t help anything. So, I guess what I am wondering is what should I do to get over this obsession? 

I’ve read some other posts and many of them state that the person needs a hobby. But really with any free time I have outside of school work I work on coding and building electronic projects. So I honestly believe that I’m busy enough not to be obsessing over a thing. 
But I’m open to any and every suggestion.

241,"Sorry if I ramble, I'm just going to outline the bad shit that happened to me and then the effects. I think I should contact my doctor, but I want your guys' opinion. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mum was a drug addict and an alcoholic who suffers from more than a few psychiatric disorders including bipolar. When we were children she emotionally and physically abused myself and my five sisters. She later allowed men to abuse us sexually. 

&amp;#x200B;

We were all taken into foster care. I was cared for by two emotionally abusive elderly people who made me terrified of the world. I was heavily bullied in school. My anxiety levels have been through the roof daily for over 10 years on an almost continual basis. 

&amp;#x200B;

These days I am finding it hard to function. My anxiety got to such an unmanageable level that I had to drop out of University and, just this past year, had to resign my position at work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went four months without showering before, and I urinate in bottles in my bedroom and hoard them. This only makes my anxiety 10x worse in case my landlord discovers this. But I can't overcome some mental block, and consequently spend upwards of 12 hours per-day simply lying on my bed. These periods of lethargy are punctuated by fits of anger and sorrow, wherein I will smash up my stuff, knock all of my books over or cry for a long time alone.

&amp;#x200B;

There are other problems, too. I'm unable to connect with people. I knowingly, but unconsciously (hard to explain) act in a certain way around people: over-the-top, funny, dramatic, sarcastic. What's funny is that hardly anyone I've met has apparently seen through the act, and I can function well around people if I have to, but it only provokes a greater sense of anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

I attended counselling after I tried to arrange to have myself murdered by a guy in London, but I chickened out. The counselling didn't work. As well-intentioned as my counsellor was (she recommended mindfulness), I couldn't overcome the thought of, ""None of this is going to fix me."" - Thereafter, though, I just lied to her and told her I felt better so that I didn't have to attend.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how much of this I should tell my doctor. Please let me know what you guys think. I'm reaching a point of extremis.",15Jun2020,1
242," So first things first, medic said i might be on initial stage schizophrenia, before the meds when i was going to travess the avenue near my home, something on the back of my head always said to me that i should jump infront of the cars that were passing by, after the avenue there is a bridge, there my mind told me to toss my bag with phone and everything at the river, also i was way more hatefull before the meds, angry all the time. these days with the meds im better but still i have emotional flattening, i dont care about most people these days to be honest, i use to feel empathy but it just vanished, one thing that still buggers me is that i was with the doctor and a suicide survivor, she told me her story, but i didnt feel anything, no pitty, no empathy, nothing. sometimes, even with the meds when i see a sharp object or tool, i imagine myself hitting the nearest person to me, like my sister was fixing something in her home and she was below me and i imagined myself hiting her with the screwdriver in the head, the thing going all the way in and she dropping. i know its messed up but still i gotta tell someone. and these violent impulses makes me wanna stab people on the street, anyone that give me a funny look or laugh near me. since i was bullied a lot i think i got a chip on my shoulder and this makes things way worse for me.

245,"So I have been with my girlfriend for about 2 and a half years now, things were okay for the majority of it but about a year ago her brother came back to her house and she started to have really bad, well, let's call it ""episodes"" I am by no means am expert and all the information I know comes from her and research I've done on my own, she tells me she dissasociates, in simple words she literally stops talking and curls into a ball and hides in a corner. 

But anyway, apparently her brother has a long story of substance abuse and has caused her a lot of issues, to the point that she's quite literally scared of him, she hides in her room a refuses to leave (to go as  far as not going to the restroom for days) 

I've talked to her parents and they told me how mental illness ""runs in the family"" and that they have tried literally everything but even when I'm therapy she refuses to talk. And don't get me wrong, she's a sweet, funny and talkative girl but now it feels like at even the slightest inconvenient or when someone disagrees with her she just has an episode. I feel like I can't communicate or disagree with her. however when these episodes happen I never leave her side (I try to talk to her or get close to her) but then she accuses me of trying to ""guilt her out of it"". 

And on top of that she has a very bad food intolerance that took a long time to pinpoint (when she was younger) and as a result she's always weak and sleeps 10-22h every day. She's been cutting her arm and the best explanation I've gotten from her is that she wants people to see she's not okau. Oh and she has a very bad case of anxiety (she can't order at drive thrus and has to cover her ears whenever I do)

Since she's so physically weak and she needs to do things, I pretty much do everything (cleaning, driving, cooking) and recently she's started to do some of these things on her own, and I thought it was a good thing but now while I'm at work she texts me about how miserable she is and how's she's planing on suicide because she's gross and weak and how she sometimes hallucinates while vacuuming because she's so weak (she also purposely goes more than 24h without eating) because, well, I don't know, I don't have an explanation for that. I offer her my help but she refuses to take it while also complaing so much when I don't help. I don't know what to do, I work 10h every day and I have to sleep early every night and she always has something to feel bad about or cries till late at night and if I don't console her she accuses me of ""getting tired of her"" 
I'm making an inhuman effort to keep myself from collapsing, I am getting tired and I don't know how much longer I can take. I tried to confront her and her solution was just repeatedly telling me to leave her and how horrible of a human being she is and how maybe if she's by herself she can die in peace. She refuses to come to therapy with me because she says she has tried. I don't want to leave her, I really want to help her and see her get better. Does anybody know what I can do to help her?

249,"TW: self harm.




Hi, everyone. So a few years ago, I’d had a really bad relapse after getting into a big fight with my mum and sister. Our family environment has always been incredibly toxic and my mental health was never as bad as when I was living with them (luckily I’ve been living alone for a long while now and they don’t stay on the same continent as me). 

About 3-4 years ago I was really going through it, it’s all a blur but those years were really really bad. I’d recently gone through a bad breakup, the relationship ended because of my mental health. I was going through my BA and it was really tough. On top of that, my family was being overwhelming af and they fight... a lot. Everything became a fight, and if end up involved whether it was about me or not, they’d drag me into it. 

I don’t remember much of the build up, but I remember wanting to disappear, wanting them to just shut the fuck up for once, make my own thoughts slow down, just make every single thing in and around me stop. I blanked and at the end of it I’d popped my head open because I kept hitting it. I wear a lot of rings so it was pretty bad... 

i don’t remember much of what happened immediately after but I remember hearing my mum yelling my name, my sister started screaming at my mum saying it was her fault , and then I was somehow at the hospital. My mum made me lie to the ER doctor and say that “I got dizzy because of my period and I fell.”  She kept asking me if I got the story straight. 

I know where she was coming from: it would be on my record somewhere if I got institutionalised and might have been difficult for me to get a job in the future. Also, her reputation. I don’t agree with it, it’s why I brought it up years later. Looking back, I really needed professional help. I was incredibly suicidal and had been severely self harming for years. I’d stopped for a few months but this episode threw me right back into the thick of it. I should have told the doctor truth, and if the doctors wanted me institutionalised, I honestly think it would have been a good thing. I needed help... it took me so so long to recover from those episodes on my own and now, years later, I have severe recurring chronic migraines and have an MRI scheduled cause I never got the mental or physical treatment I needed because I kept being coerced into lying to doctors. 

She did apologise and admitted that it probably would have been for the best but she was just “trying to protect me”. I don’t buy it. I believe she believed she was trying to protect me but in reality she was protecting herself and her reputation. I’m just glad I can look back on it now and see where it went all wrong when I was actually getting better. It makes me really sad cause it was clearly a cry for help. I just wanted all the pain and noise to stop... 

I’m a lot better now and have started therapy, of my own accord. It’s good to have control over my own life. It’s taken many many years but I no longer have to feel shamed of my mental health. I can say I need help and not be scared of someone stopping me. I’m sorry this is long, but I just wanted to get it off my chest.",15Jun2020,1

Heyy so I just figured talking about it could help me process a wee bit and someone might relate or have some advice

Im currently medicated for anxiety and depression, however these past couple months have been really difficult in a way I had never felt before. I’m not suicidal at all or fantasise about it anymore, not because i am happy existing but because i have kinda just wanna try new things and hit rock bottom instead. Like the worse I am, the freer? If that makes any sense

My anxiety is way better than when I first saw the doctor, but every day is just the same shit over and over, and I have kinda come to terms with it. I’ve been trying things to take my mind out of it, including overdosing (which i know was irresponsible and won’t do again), cbd (didn’t work for me), then ended up with self harming. I like seeing blood and it calms me down—although now I’m always worrying if the cuts are showing.

To make things extra awkward, last time i talked to my doctor i just basically said everything was fine and now I’m not sure how to go about this, or even what to tell/not tell him. I have self-harmed before but uhm never really opened much about it and am afraid of how he might react",15Jun2020,1

Sometimes it takes me hours to fall asleep, sometimes I wake up and have to catch my breath as if I've stopped breathing at night, sometimes I'm just tossing and turning all night and can't stay asleep at all. 

My psychiatrist recommended Seroquel, but I've read some pretty terrible things about it. I've been working out for the past 7 months really trying to lose some weight, but I gain weight easily and it's not easy for me to lose it. This is my main concern with Seroquel, the weight gain side effect.

So basically I wanna rant a bit cause now whenever I'm in my room it feels like everything is contaminated and like ants are crawling all over me and it makes me wanna curl into a ball and peel off my skin.

255,"Hi. I tried posting to r/relationshipadvice, but have to wait for approval to post. I made a throwaway account because I am paranoid, but I really need urgent help.

Last night I (29M) ended up having a huge fight with my partner (28F) of 4 years. I feel I have to tell you a bit about us, before sharing what happened last night. This is probably going to be long, bear with me please. I need your help.

I have been struggling with my mental health for about 13 years after my brother was in a car crash. He survived, but sustained heavy damage to his brain and has been handicapped and basically had his quality of life torn to shreds. He cant do anything on his own, bound to a wheel chair and assistants 24/7. His short term memory is sort of a groundhog day scenario in which it just resets every other day. His long term memory sort of works, but its a strange one. We grew up in a very small town and the health services are very poor, so it was up to my mom and dad to take care of him. It really fucked up our family. I had already moved out to go to high school in a different town (age 16 at the time). I havent really worked through the trauma, and thats all on me, but nevertheless I have managed to lead a good enough (but quite nihilistic) life. I love learning so I have spent the years educating myself, getting 2 bachelor degrees and trying to find myself and friends along the way.

I met my girlfriend in college. We started the same degree in 2014, became very close friends and soon after lovers. Moved in together in the last year of our education in 2017. Since then I have been freelancing and trying to make it as a creative writer while also working on my mental health. She is a very successfull and sought after script writer/director in our city. She is very ambitious and extremely driven. I admire and love her deeply. I have never been envious of her success, it only makes me soar with pride. But theres no doubt that I have developed quite a inferiority complex in the last years (our close friends from college share her strong characteristics of what it takes to make it in the business, so there are a lot of successfull people in my social group). She and all of my friends are very supportive of me, and have always admired me and my writing because I have some sort of ability to pierce the veil between sincerity and irony. Unfortunately i both hate and doubt myself too much to be able to actually write what i want. I can help others with the same fears and problems, but never apply it to myself.

And as I am writing this I'm starting to notice something familiar. This whole text is starting to become about me. My girlfriend is often accusing me of being narcissistic (which my former therapist also told me is a trait I score above average on). I know this, and I know I'm not always able to see it coming, but I am trying to get better. My girlfriend has always done what has to be done in her life. She is the embodiment of a strong independent woman, and never gotten anything for free. Besides that she has lived a very comfortable and priveliged life, both emotionally and economically. This is where we are very different. And these differences are often the root cause of why our normal fights end up in me screaming my lungs off. When my brothers accident turned my life upside down, and the initial sadness was all cried out, I replaced sadness with anger and rage. Against the universe. This is a huge problem, because when I get sad, I actually just get angry, and in the worst moments I cant control what I am saying.

So: Last night, we had a fight. She has been struggling with a career choice for a couple of months, and I have been supporting her the absolute best way I could have done. Encouraging her to continue down the path she wants to go, encouraging her to trust her driven and ambitious nature (and basically fuck the eventual haters, doubters, and hypothetical scenarios she spins up about this decision). I have told her time and again what she needs to hear. She has issues about opening up and being vulnerable to our friends, because her shell is very hard. It has always been like this, because she needs herself to be strong and invulnerable to reach her goals. I have been telling her that she HAS to open up and share with our friends, as well as talking to a professional if she wants to continue growing. And last night she shared her concerns with some of our friends, with me by her side. They told her word for word, in the exact same tone, what I have been telling her for weeks and months.

She was relieved. She listened. After we got home she told me how great it was that ""someone finally told her the right things. Exactly what she needed to hear"". And I told her ""yeah, isn't it strange how things sound different when it comes from someone else?"". I wasn't actually trying to say that she isn't listening to me. But we have had fights before about how I feel she doesnt take me seriously any more, or even respects me to some extent. She knows Im not living up to my potential, and has started to kind of resenting me for it. She has told me how she has started to get annoyed by me being home every day she comes home from work, how my mood and aura infests our home (when I am feeling down, but also on a regular basis, which hurts me a lot). She pounced on me immediately, and when I realized this was going to be a fight, I couldnt stop myself (we were very drunk as well, by the way). I started yelling at her how this is just another example of her not respecting me anymore, that she doesn't take me seriously. Then it was a lot of back and forth about how I am exactly the same to her. How I am a narcissist and everything has to be about me all the time. Then I just completely lost it, and stepped over her boundaries. I was in a rage and screamed at her that she has no clue about real struggles, that she spins up childish irrelevant scenarios that arent real issues. That all she has ever struggled with is the realization that every human being has to die at some point (this was her ""existential crisis"" during her early 20s). I basically belittled her for not having endured any ""real"" pain in her life. She started crying. I knew I was way out of line, but I had no control, and felt no desire to stop. I wanted to hurt her feelings. So I kept going until I could see how much I hurt her.

My mind and physical health has been deteriorating and spiraling downwards for a while. I have been unemployed for a long time, and my inferiority complex has been growing a lot. Last night it just crumbled into insanity. I was actively sabotaging the best thing in my whole life. After we stopped yelling I went out in the living room and punched my fist into the wall until it nearly broke. Sat down, staring out the window for an hour, drunk, shamefull, a sorry piece of shit contemplating how horrible I just had been to the love of my life. And how small she also makes me feel. Then I fell asleep on the couch. I woke up, she went to work, I went to my doctor who contacted my previous therapist trying to get me back in their service (public service, so theres a wait list and certain requirements need to be met to get their help).

When I got home I just slept until my girlfriend came home. I had bought her flowers on the way home, and prepared my apology. I told her how sorry I was – I was way out of line. I crossed a border I understand might be too far, I never want to do this again to you, but understand if this was the last chance. She told me she never wants to confine anything to me ever again, she doesn't trust me anymore.

I understand that. I really do. I know I might have fucked up to the point where we are done. And I dont blame her if this is the end of us. I love her more than anything else in my life. She is unreasonable and makes me frustrated, but that is nothing compared to the love we have for eachother. How much she has supported me, how long she has stood by me in sickness and health. I'm afraid I've driven her away for the last time. I have told her how sorry I really am. I don't know what else to do now.

Can you help me? What can I do? How do I get her trust back? How do I even suggest she can trust me again? Words aren't enough, I need to show her how much I love her, and how sorry I am. I just dont know how. Please help me.",15Jun2020,1

I called them later begging them not to cut me out completely, since we had been friends for 11 years at that point, and their only answer was ""Why?"" as in 'Why would I keep in touch?'

I don't really understand why injuring my leg could have brought this on when I didn't injure it falling down stairs, I never thought about falling before I injured myself.

I'd really appreciate if someone could shine some light on why this might have happened and if there's anything I can do to stop myself thinking about it so much.",15Jun2020,1

264,I have been replaced at my old job but now applying for more places I finally heard back from one. My mom is making me get a job just graduating high school and so I applied places. I got word back from McDonald’s and my options are to go in for an interview which I do not really want to do because if I start working I will be trapped in the way that I hated my last job mom would not let me quit until other job secured threatened turning my phone off for good which is the only real thing that makes me happy because I am able to talk to friends family etc. anyways I have some mental health struggles with very bad OCD and compulsive issues along with horrible paranoia and I do not know if I could take the stress that fast food jobs put people through so I have heard. I do not know what to do because my mom wants to know if I hear back from anywhere and I am enjoying the time I have not working because I can relax talk to friends talk to my girlfriend etc. but I do not know what to do. Please leave some advice.,15Jun2020,1
