0,"When I was 12 I was sexually assaulted/molested. I didn’t tell anyone until I was 18 or 19. That same 12 year old girl got sent to run a bunch of test. Turns out I had a learning disability. 
Throughout elementary, high school, and college I was bullied. 
I was not doing good academically, had no friends, and was bullied physically and mentally. 


When I was 19 I had to witness my own father become mentally ill. Was in and out of the hospital visiting him. That same year I  sent my own sibling to the hospital because she became mentally unstable. Witnessed my own eyes with her attempting suicide. She even hated me at one point for saving her.

When I was 20 I was in and out of hospital taking care of my grandparents, aunt, and sister. 

When I was 21 I found a man that I thought would be the love of my life but in the end I lost myself trying to build him up. 

At 22 I was diagnosed with depression 

I COULD have let my past trauma ruin my future relationships with men. I could have failed in school. I could have physically fought back with my bullies. I could have ended my life a few months back. 

But in my life. My story. I choose to let people in. I choose to give love. I choose to be kind to people even when they don’t deserve it. I choose to succeed in life and now I work in the hospital saving lives. I choose to survive and get help to be the best version of me. 

The moral of me writing this is to tell you that It may be a bad chapter but it’s not your entire story. 

You are not a victim. 

You are a survivor.

3,"I’m not even sure where to start with this really, all I know is that it will be a long post but I’ll try and keep it short, please help me. 

I won’t talk about my own life but I also suffer with mental health issues (recently been diagnosed with cptsd and ocd) including depression and anxiety myself. We have a 2 year old son together (or he will be in 3 days!) and live together in a flat. I’m 21 and he is 22. 
He suffers depression (diagnosed) and (undiagnosed) anxiety. His dad is out of the picture and has been since he was young - he beat and raped my MIL, my partner was only little at the time so doesn’t remember any of it. However, he has been having nightmares and panic attacks (especially recently) about seeing his dad beating his mum and last night especially, raping his mum. He says it happens at her house and at our home also, he is there but physically can’t touch them to stop him or get away he’s just stuck watching. 
Anyway, he has also struggled with our son and being a father (although he is a great dad) but some days he can be quite horrible to the point I’m trying to keep our son away from him. He will stay in the bedroom playing his PC or PS4 till god knows what time and will moan or get pissed off if our son goes in to see him or see what he’s doing (as intrigued toddlers do) and start shouting at him for even playing or little things and it’s like WOAH calm down, you know? I’m no where near a perfect parent, I get irritated with our son too but when he’s doing nothing wrong or even playing he’s being told off and it just breaks my heart. He doesn’t really play with our son or interact with him often unless it’s on the odd occasion and it’s just heartbreaking and I just feel like a single mum most days. I have my own struggles too, I bathe with our son because otherwise I don’t have time to bath on my own. I do all of the housework and cook 99% of the meals. I have NO alone or breathing time/space. I get our son to sleep, I get up with him during the night and I get up with him in the mornings so I’m also extremely tired and tbh just drained. He will stay in bed till 12-2pm and I’m actually going to stay with my parents tomorrow for two nights because “he needs some alone time” but doesn’t understand that I need some alone time too? Or when I ask them to leave me alone for a while he gets all pissy.. which annoys me even more until I just breakdown. I’m struggling and I don’t know what to do.  He doesn’t talk to me at all. I’ve seen him cry (or show any sort of emotion) once which was when our son was born. He never tells me anything because “it makes him feel worse” or when he does he says “at least you feel better. One of us has too” or something like that. There’s no communication there at all, for instance I tried to give him a kiss earlier whilst he was playing PC before I left the room and he just swerved and tutted at me so o said okay sorry I only wanted a kiss and then he had a go at me for being moody all the time...? 

Half of me is saying just be patient he’ll get better soon and get back to his normal self (whatever that may be now) and the other half of me is saying to just call it a day because I’m slowly starting to give up I really don’t know how much more I can take. I love him I really do but he’s not helping himself at all. 

Every time I say to him about phoning the GP about asking for some antidepressants even if it’s just temporary he tells me to stop so I really don’t know what to do anymore. Please can someone help me because I don’t know how much more I can take.",13Jun2020,1
4,"I’m 99.9% sure I won’t kill myself, to start. A part of me still has hope things will get better and that part always outweighs the others. But I really, truly do not want to be here anymore. The only thing I feel is misery. I just bring everyone else down with me, too. I hate myself, I hate my life, all of it. I hate living. It’s too much and every day when I wake up I’m just bombarded by self-hatred and depression. I have no idea what to do. I haven’t felt this awful in such a long time. If anyone can help in any way I would appreciate it.",13Jun2020,0
6,"I had a really scary dream last night and I was wondering if anyone had ever experienced something like this, I fell asleep on my back which usually causes me to have nightmares but this one was different. It was one of those dreams where it felt super real, at the side of my bed was a black figure with white eyes staring at me, which isn’t uncommon for me to have nightmares about I watch a lot of horror movies but it really scared me and I actually woke up and jumped out of my bed and started saying “Waite Waite Waite” and slammed into the wall next to my door.when I realized I was awake i turned on my lights and didn’t go back to sleep until it was night out. I’m a pretty still sleeper even with nightmares I usually just wake myself up and fall right back asleep. It was just really weird and scary and I don’t know if it has to do with stress cause I had an anxiety attack a few hours earlier. Just wondering if anyone else has had nightmares like that.",13Jun2020,1
7,"I can be in a good mood and then try to enter a discussion or just be in casual conversation with my friends and someone says something somewhat degrading or hit one of my insecurities and my mood completely switches. Idk, it doesnt even have to be mean but when someone calls me out or is negative to  me i just dont want to be part of the group anymore. i hope that made sense",13Jun2020,14
8,"Obviously a throwaway account

So I’ve had a friend for most my life who I’m just starting to notice may have some mental health issues. He thinks he has mystic powers, and will do things like speak in tongues or do really unsettling motions that he’s told me are “rituals” or “meditations”. Don’t get me wrong, I believe that meditation is good for the body, but he believes specific meditations do things like boost speed or ward off stuff. He also has delusions of grandeur, often stating how he could break through metal if he wanted, or “take on” a bunch of people if he wanted. 

Another issue is how he constantly acts like everyone has been against him in life. He takes the isolated path believing it was “destined” for him, yet every time people reach out and help, he pushes them away and will complain that he’s never got any help. He doesn’t believe he’ll find love or happiness in life too. 

Along with all of this, he flinches when touched (I know him very well, and he has never been abused by family or anyone for that matter). He also has no sense of boundaries, he’ll poke people in their stomachs and butts thinking it’s funny. To top it off, he’ll punch and hurt people when he’s excited, or sometimes hit for no reason at all. 

I’m also very worried because he thinks his way of doing things is the only way, and will reject most other approaches to a situation. 

My final piece to say is that he used to cut part of skin (not to try and kill himself) as a way to “focus”. He acts super mature and wise but any problem and he acts a bit childish, I.e. throws stuff away, hits bed, etc. 


He’s frankly sad to watch because I feel like no one can help, and I don’t want him to harm himself in the long run. He’s practically an adult, and it’s scary to watch. Please, if you have any suggestions for me to talk to him I need them.",13Jun2020,1

10,"Hi, im new in this subreddit, im from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Okay, my problem is that now i cant listen to Taylor´s music. I listened to Lover, reputation (best album in my opinion), RED and Speak Now, but a week ago, i watched reputation stadium tour, and that was the moment that i fell in love with Taylor. Before that moment i listened to Taylor only because her music is so good, now i know that she is more that only music, she is a very good artist, sooooooooo perfect and beautiful❤️❤️

coming back with what i said, after seeing that ""movie"", on the night of that day, I began to rave with a relationship with Taylor, everything i would say to her, etc etc.

But at the same time i was so sad because all that delirium was impossible, and now i cant listen to Taylor because i fell so sad.

I want to talk to a psychologist but in the current situation due to coronavirus and quarantine, I cant.  
happened to someone? what did you do? I don't know if I'm brain sick or not but I wanted to know your opinions, i wait your answers.

11,"Hello Reddit! 

For the interest of being discret, I'm M, 28M, Scotland. 

During the year of 2014-2019, I was in a very unhappy relationship that resulted in me missing out on my prime 20s. I went from an immature young man to an authorative step dad figure in a few months. It made me miserable.

In September 2018, en route home fron Self Defense training. I contemplated if people would give a shit if I was to commit suicide. I got a huge fright and opened up to my partner and close friends. I also sought help from NHS Psychology and was placed on a 18 month waiting list (shocking, I know!). I sought help from my GP, who prescribed me minimal dosage Serotonin and they helped balance my mood.

December 2019, I broke up with my partner and moved out. Best move I ever made and I felt that I regained control of my life. I found meditation and mindfulness helped a lot. 

March 2020 - Got my first Psychology appointment which was basically an ice breaker session with my psychologist. But sadly, I don't know if you guys heard, but somebody in China ate an animal riddled with COVID 19 and caused a global pandemic resulting in Psychology being shut until the forseeable future. Story of my life lol.

I met a girl who I fell for hard and we began seeing each other. It didn't work out and I felt like shit again. It's been on the back of my mind ever since.

I try and market myself as this guy who has his shit together. But underneath I'm crumbling, all I want is to regain control of my life and be happy again. But with the current circumstances it just isn't happening. I genuinely feel like I'm frauding everyone, depicting something that I am not and it's making me feel like shit because I feel that I cannot be honest with people.

I wanted to get all of this off my chest and seek help from you guys. What can I do?",13Jun2020,1

13,"I’m a 33 y.o. male in the UK. I’ve been furloughed from my job since March and have been at home all day nearly every day (I go for a walk a couple of times a week). 

For the most part, I’ve managed ok during lockdown. I live with my mum, so I’m not alone and I keep in touch with friends. In addition, I’ve been keeping myself busy; online courses, exercise, reading etc. 

However, over the past week or so, my mood and motivation to do things has decreased. I find myself in the same monotonous routine. While all the anger, hate, arguing and emotion I see in the news and on social media has effected me as well.

To be honest I’m not sure why I’m writing on here. I guess I just wanted somewhere that I think I can trust to share how I’m feeling right now.",13Jun2020,4

I trust you are well.   
Not really sure how to do this, so I’ll post this to get started 🙂   
I want to help people AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE   
My Backstory:   


* i was diagnosed with Schizophrenia over a decade ago 
* I went fully public with this on Social Media 4 days ago 
* I’m on Social Media (facebook) @ Kevin M Walker and kevinwalker.life (a LEADERSHIP blog) 

The problem I want to solve:   


* I think we should talk more about MENTAL ILLNESS and make sure people know that you can still function highly with it 
* Understand psychosis - especially the fact that you can have DEEPLY MEANINGFUL life experiences through it,.. i know i have! I will be releasing these stories ..like talking to aliens for example..on my Social media 

How am I operating?   


* I want to public speak on mental illness 
* I want to keep the narrative positive and focus on ABILITY over DISABILITY 
* I want us all to practice more COMPASSION 

If you have ANY advice or know-how on going forward with such a venture I would LOVE to hear your FEEDBACK   
Let’s see where all this goes!!   
Kind regards,

16,"So I'm currently in the process of being diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder. I've given my alters names and I've written about the personalities of my alters and as someone new to this, I could really do with some advice on coping with switching and trying to understand what goes on in my head. ♥️

Meghan (the real me, my birth name) 

Meghan is broken, feels the need to wear the mask of other personas to stop herself getting hurt yet causes physical pain to release the wrath and emotional turmoil of the damage dealt to other personas. Very much into 90s acoustic. Very much a singer.

Missy (my main alter, I'm Missy every day pretty much) 

Missy is sensible, smart, kind, loving, caring, and very much an outgoing and open, honest hopeless romantic. Positive emotions. Loves pop and anything in the charts. She will go out of her way to make other people happy but never puts herself first. 

Luna (my crazy alter, my guilty pleasure of a favourite) 

Bonkers, funny as fuck yet impulsive, self destructive to social groups at times but is very much the comedian of the bunch. Delusional and doesn't have a very good sense of reality. She lives with her head in the clouds, like a day dream. The metal head of the crowd and the musician. 

Mairead (my Irish alter. Irish for Meghan) 

Missy, but Irish. A lot more negative emotions involved. Feels pain from things. Half Missy, half Meghan in a way. She's more of a hybrid but gone wrong in a way. There's more rapid emotional swings. Mairead doesn't get angry, she just gets upset. 

Pandora ""Dora"" (the bitch, you will want to run!) 

Dora is the worst of the worst. She can be totally unpredictable, unprecedented and unstoppable when it comes to seeking revenge. Very much armageddon. She's very hostile towards others, and can become angry very quickly and rather snappy. 

Please tell me if this is okay? 
I'm new to all this as since 2015 I've only had a BPD diagnosis. 

Thank you ♥️",13Jun2020,6

19,"Keep in mind that english is not my first language...

 I was in a toxic friendship for 4 years. We met in school, she was the most popular and beautiful girl on our town, and i was a weirdo who had small circle of other freaks. I wasn’t even interested in her, to be honest i didn’t care about her at all, everyone talked about her, everyone followed her on instagram and wanted to look like her, wanted to have „life” like her...even my friends. And one day she just sat next to me on our math class, she didn’t say anything neither did i, i thought that maybe she wants to make fun of me or something, maybe it was a bet idk...it started to happen all the time, she started to sit with me on every lesson. My friends noticed that she was staring at me all the time, they were right...Our first two lessons got cancelled, and just the two of us didn’t know about it, so we came to school as usual...we sat together in silence and then she asked me If i want to go somewhere and i said yes...We were so alike that it was almost impossible, we were like long lost twins, like clons...i couldn’t believe it i finally met someone who understood me, we liked the same things, everything....Then after a year of being just school friends with strange unspoken bond, she started texting me...i was very surprised idk....But you see...im gonna stop right there because this story is very very very long, and i have a lot to say anyway so. I recently lost my bestfriend for 12 years(she was a dangerous psycho)and started to be friends with X i knew that it was not ok...i wasn’t ready after what happened...but i let her in. When we started our friendship i was in a very bad mental condition, i wanted to kill myself everyday, i hated everything about myself, i just wanted to die....I live in pathological family, what bonded me and X was exactly that,yes the most popular girl in school had hell in her home just like me. She was the first and last person to know about my family, about what is happening there, i let her in, i let her to my house, she was the first and last person to met my parents. It was the same for me. We found understanding in each other, it gave us the peace that we both needed.  It was like a movie, i felt like i was in the movie all the time....i was really happy with her maybe we even loved each other more than just sisters? Idk...After some time things have changed...she started psychically abusing me, as i said i was very mentally weak, wanted to kill myself everyday...she took advantage of that. She was manipulating me, telling me that im ugly, worthless,crazy....I believed her....then after a year of being treated like shit, someone came back to our town....she was a close friend of X so naturally i would became her friend too, friends of X are my friends, and my friends don’t exist because X is telling me that my friends are just some ugly losers and i have to leave them(i did). Y was very different from X she was very nice, calm and idk she was just a very good person, she wasn’t judging anyone just because in her eyes they were ugly (like X did). X noticed that Y and i are very similar, she started to manipulate me into hating Y i almost fell for it, im glad i didn’t. I couldn’t leave Y she didn’t deserve that, she was just a nice person who genuinely liked me, and i liked her too.And there was a lot going on,but lets go to the time that i started medical treatment. I started taking pills (not for mental ilness) i started to see things as they really were. I started to notice how X was treating me...how i meant nothing to her, i was just because i was. She didn’t care about me at all. Y stopped being friends with X because of how she treated me(i didn’t know that i was the reason)but soon i found out. Y helped me realize that i don’t deserve it, X made me believe that i am no one without her(i still kinda believe in it) that i will be ruined without her....And so we had a fight with X for 14 hours, the reason was very random but it evolved into fight about everything...she told me that our friendship means nothing to her, i was nothing to her...it never meant anything to her. It was over to me, i have had enough it wasn’t our first fight...but it was her who ended it, i just accepted it. Now? Its been a week since we ended our friendship..lets say that she destroyed my reputation (told lies about me to all our „friends”) at this moment i have just 3 people? Because they were only mine friends not ours. I am back to being a ,,loser”. No one understands me only she did, no one will ever understand me and i accept it, im not even looking for understanding anymore, i don’t want a bestfriend anymore. She was the last one ever will have, i have had enough of this bullshit, it always ends the same. It would be better for me to not have a bestfriend in my life again, and well...the bond that we had (still do) happens once in a lifetime. She was and always will be my soulmate, but she’s sick, she’s toxic and narcissist i tried i really tried...but im tired...i want to live my life not as her shadow but as me. Im very glad for Y, she is there for me and to be honest i don’t even know why. Why me and not X? I don’t know. No one would ever be X...even after everything that she done to me...i am not angry at her i cant hate her. I would never hate her, she is my soulmate. I just want to say, even If you love someone its not enough to stay with this person. If its toxic you have to run away and nothing else matters...save yourself...",13Jun2020,1
20,"This is just gonna be a short rant just so i can try to get a little bit off my chest

So long story short as much as i hate saying it I have been through a-lot and as a result struggle with alot of trauma

Within the past few weeks memories of sexual abuse i have never came to terms with or even accepted, still dont even full accept, or acknowledge have came to surface and I still live with my abuser

im 16, cps is not an option for a multitude of reasons.

Since i was ten i have had no one i could completely open up to

My mom is in another state or relationship seems like it is okay but i will never be able to talk to her because i dont want to further pressure her mental illness in case it still bothers her. She told me (while on drugs) that i made her want to kill herself and she said she was leaving to do so but i stopped her. As a kid after my dad left for some time she would choke and beat me. She betrayed my trust for years while on drugs and manipulated me. I raised my sibling for two years. But within the past fee months she’s got her life together but honestly the damage is done.

My dad is the one that sexually abused me as a kid and has told me awful things like to kill myself and that im worthless. He’s punched me in the face too and won’t acknowledge anything. Lately he’s been good and recovering from being an alcoholic. However two days ago he was being hurtful and started yelling at my older brother screaming he doesn’t believe in mental illness. Since my mental health has tanked lately i thought about asking for a therapist. This definetly made me change my mind.

My boyfriend is the sweetest person in the whole world but he’s got his own struggles and I don’t need to exhaust him further with mine. I already tell him enough I shouldn’t tell him more and I can’t anyways because im scared he would overreact.

Lately i have been dealing with panic attacks again, feeling completely emotionless, overreacting to everything, and having motivation for nothing. I’m at a point in my life where I genuinely hate myself and believe that at least my parents would be better off without me

I honestly would just kill myself if I didn’t have responsibilities like my younger brother and boyfriend i would be leaving behind. I wish I could go without hurting them. I couldn’t kill myself knowing I’d be severely hurting the two people who have ever shown me love and kindness however a six year long streak of depression and hitting new lows every other year gets so tiring. Im so tired. I hate faking every single emotion i am feeling while I constantly just fantasize about killing myself and making the pain go away. 

No one ever validates or truly cares when i tell them what ive been through and honestly for most of them it isn’t their fault. 

I wish i could be angry about so many things but all I do is make (valid mostly) excuses for all of them. 

Fuck my mom for not ever checking on me even ONCE when i told her i was severely depressed. Fuck her for beating me even though she was hurt and on drugs fuck her for making me her counselor and her punching bag even though i was just a little kid

Fuck my dad for never believing in my illness and for always making everything my fault. Fuck him for touching me. Fuck him for lying, fuck him for abandoning me and his kids fuck him for taking advantage of me and manipulating me fuck him for NEVER taking responsibility fuck him for hurting people i love and neglecting his children

Fuck my aunt for being jealous of me because my mom only got two years in jail not a life sentence. Fuck her for ignoring me begging for help  from a man who at the time was grabbing my ass constantly when all i wanted was for her to help me understand that it was wrong and it was only the beginning FUCK her for manipulating me and acting like she loved me just to get me to come over and babysit her out of control children she neglects and so i can clean her disgusting roach infested house 

Fuck my best friend who i let confide in me for years and once i did the same with him he used all my issues against me and tried to make me feel like shit and played it off like it was an accident so its magically okay, 

Fuck everybody who told me my problems weren’t valid because they had it worse

Fuck the people in my family who hate me for no godamn reason other than the fact that hey! I didnt get put in the system! My life must’ve been so great living with a lifeless junkie who probably didnt even give a shit about me at the time! I must be soooo lucky living in a financially stable home with a dad (WHO SEXUALLY ABUSED ME AND HAS EMOTIONALLY HURT ME SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID) GOD I AM SOOOO FUCKING LUCKY HOW CAN I NOT SEE HOW BLESSED I AM TO HAVE A MOM AND DAD RIGHT?

It ended for the most part when I became 21. But now I hate myself for what I said to them. We all get along but I feel awful whenever I think about my past behavior.

26,"I know this is probably weird but I don’t want to talk about this with anyone I know, so I’m posting it here. I’m 17, I’m a guy, I’ve never been in a relationship, and one of the reasons for that is because I have a terrible fear of being cheated on. I don’t know why but I just feel like it’s bound to happen to me, no matter what I do. I get anxious about it now and then and I get pissed off thinking about it. (ok now it gets a bit strange) I’ve even thought of cheating on my partner (if ever even get one) as a “preventive measure” so that when they cheat on me it’s not as nearly as humiliating. If I ever get cheated on I feel like the only way of getting rid of that burden is to commit suicide or isolate myself from society. I really don’t understand why I’m so afraid of this, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with me, physically or psychologically, I think that I’m fairly attractive (at least I like to believe that) and I have a normal social life.

I've looked on the internet for advice but couldn't find anything related to my question. I feel a bit lost in what I can do. I'd rather not go, but I would rather not be admited there involuntarily.

31,"\-I've spaced out the lines so my essay here isn't entirely horrible to read.

So, I'm 16. I think I have depression(I don't know if it's just how I am or something, but it's the only

thing I could think of). I had a heart to heart with myself yesterday and I pretty much found out that

I'm at a constant stalemate with myself about what I want to do and what I actually need to do. I know

I'm never going to be able to make myself tell anything I write here to my friends or family(especially

family); I don't know why but I hate showing negative emotion at all to anyone I have a long-standing

relationship with except myself. I'm working on getting my physical body together because we all

know that 6ft/250lb is more than just a little overweight; I'm starting to make a list of meals that are

both healthy, decent-tasting at least, and easy to make. I'm also committing myself to 20-30 minutes

of cardio a day(the hard part) and weight lifting in between(the easy part, I enjoy it). If I could, I would

build a relationship with someone who I could vent to and stuff like that, but I don't know how or

where to do that. I'm also pretty introverted in general, so I'm not good at starting conversations(not

that I'm averse to them, I just can't find it in myself to actually go up and talk to some random person).

So, my question is: What should I do? I've put on this face of never being hurt so much that I'm too scared to tell anyone of my problems, especially those closest to me(not many, and my relationships with my family is not very personal in general even though I see them every day). I'm scared that the people I tell will see me in a different light.

\-

Edit: Forgot to mention. I'm pretty sure the reason I can't get myself to tell people my problems is because I don't want to waste their time or bother them, because I know I wouldn't want to be bothered by someone else. At least, that's what I think the reason is.

Edit 2: Also forgot to mention, whenever I hype myself up and say ""hell yeah, I'm committing to learning/doing this!(barring social excursions and stuff like that because people would probably start asking questions\[barring work because I want money and at this point in my life it's basically just free cash\])"" I always find some way to get out of it or forget about it.

I attempted to OD last night obviously it didn’t work but it caused me to completely miss a day of work on accident. It was a dumb impulsive mistake idk what my goal was. I forgot to refill my prescription and I have to wait till Monday to get it refilled and it’s making me act very irrationally. I was supposed to work from 11-4 but I woke up at 8pm. I was on my final warning and I’m definitely going to get fired I don’t know what to do. I work at Target if that means anything. This is my first job :( Do I be honest and tell them what happened in the hope they’ll understand and won’t fire me or will they call the police? Or will it just not matter? The last thing I need is to be hospitalized, last time I was caused severe trauma and did more harm than good. I would really appreciate some advice or anything, I’m really scared about what’s going to happen tomorrow when I go up there :(",13Jun2020,1

36,"Ive hated myself since the beginning of middle school, where I started to realize how worthless I truly am as a person. Ive changed a lot since then, Im 18 now but I still dont think theres a single person out there who would love me. Im not really the kind of person most people would actively hate, just someone who doesnt really bring any kind of value to the life of others. I have friends but no best friend and Im incapable of even considering the possibility of a relationship. I had/have a bad crush on a girl and was never able to even mention these feelings after getting to know her a little because I feel like it would imply that I think there could be any chance of her liking me back. Also doesnt help that Im incredibly unattractive to the point of me actively hating every moment I spend outside my house where people can see me. I just want to cut my entire face skin off and throw it away. I have also had pretty bad social anxiety for a long time and Im afraid that will be the last nail in the coffin for me to be completely alone for the rest of my life.

One of the worst things about me might be how my life has been so incredibly easy. I constantly read posts from people who have suffered immensely from terrible parents, bullying, abuse, mental health disorders, loss of loved ones, etc. and yet I cant get over my useless feelings. Ive been threading to even make a post like this because it feels very selfish but I want to at least have some kind of outlet to gather my thoughts. Im not even properly depressed, I feel happy on a daily basis when I do things I enjoy. Its just that in the evenings when Im alone in my room, I cant escape the reality of who I am and especially after hanging out with friends, I feel like none of them really like me. I have thoughts about self harm every single day but Im pretty sure none of it is serious. Although, I seriously doubt many people would miss me if I were to disappear.",13Jun2020,2
37,"I began taking Celexa in March for my extreme anxiety disorder. I have had anxiety my entire life but instead of treating it I just let it fester and turn into a panic disorder. Fast forward to 23 years of chronic anxiety and panic and I have a heart condition that has to be treated. Anyway....

I have felt the best I have ever felt in my life for the last 3 weeks. I have lived anxiety free and it has been amazing. I wish I hadn't missed out on this. 2 weeks ago I found out my husband cheated on me. I was angry and upset, but it's like I could not show emotion. All of my emotions about it felt forced because I felt like that was how I should feel. I did not shed one tear over it. The whole time I kept thinking it is very odd, but thought the Celexa must be a MIRACLE drug. Fast forward to about 10 days after he cheated on me. Anxiety that is unexplained (with no cause or trigger) has come back with vengeance. At first it was a small nag in my belly and now it's just utter misery again. 

Are Delayed Emotional Reactions common on Celexa? My husband and I have already talked through our problem and are currently dealing with them. I am not upset ir angry and I'm satisfied with our decision to reconcile/seek counsel.

40,"I'm not sure if anyone else has experienced this but here's the deal: I went through my work's Employee Assistance Program and was referred to a counselor . I saw her about 5 times last year, and I found the experience worse than useless. 

On paper, she had all the qualifications but holy crap she was bad. Not unethical, but just completely useless. I was there in the beginning of a mental health crisis. I felt trapped in a job that was making me depressed and anxious, I was having frequent thoughts of suicide, I was also unhappy in my personal life. I was in desperate need of help. 

So what did she do? She let me vent about how much I hated my life for about 90% of the session time, and the rest was some questionable advice about what to do. This advice included gems like ""oh you should try getting some exercise in your day"", ""being happy takes work"" and ""have you considered the military? They're always looking for people"".

The advice she gave was either laughably obvious or completely inappropriate. Even though I only saw her 5 times, I feel angry at having wasted that amount of time. I got the distinct impression that she didn't know what to do with me and was glad to get rid of me. She never made any referrals or treatment plan.

Like I'm SO bad to be around that I just infect everyone with my negativity. I've pulled away more and more. I feel so sorry for my boyfriend and kids. Being around me lately is like being around an animated corpse. I rarely speak or react and when I do it's so much raw emotion that it's hard for anyone to handle. I'm so afraid of myself and my emotions coming out that I'd rather just stay away from everyone. I need help.

46,"I’m not sure if there’s something wrong with me. Does what I feel represent anything in mental health or what? 

I just feel so done. Just absolutely exhausted and done with everything. I cannot be arsed to carry on anymore (and I don’t mean that In a suicidal way). I’m just feeling so fed up and want to be alone, yet I’m so isolated, and I suppose lonely. However I don’t like being with/around people or friends. I don’t really have any friends anymore. 

I’m not sure why but I’m feeling like this but I do. I feel as if I just want to disappear. I’m so tired but I think it’s more of a mental tiredness rather than physical. 

The best way of describing it is literally done. I am just done with this world, you know? I just want to go away, leave and disappear.

When I close my eyes I just see myself as being calm and walking into the ocean and just floating there, with no care in the world. With no energy being used. Just floating away, peacefully. Just ending up gone.

Im also feeling anxious. I’m getting these sudden bursts of anxiety, and it’s horrible. It’s that feeling when your heart drops. That exact moment your heart drops, that one singular feeling, but it’s continuous. I’m not sure why I’m feeling this anxiety but I do. I’m just sitting here and it comes and I’m just not sure.

I also feel as if I’m going to break. It’s like I have so much stuff built up inside of me, and it’s just been building and building and building, but now I’m so full I’m about to burst and just break down, but the thing is I never get to that point! 

The best way I can explain it is like this; a pot on the stove, full of water that’s starting to boil. The waters getting hotter and hotter, so hot that it starts to rise. It gets closer to the rim of the pot, but just as you think it’s about to boil over, it doesn’t! It just stays there at the rim of the pot boiling away, but not boiling over, and that’s a little like how I feel. I’m close to breaking but I just don’t.

I just feel like I’ve conditioned myself so much not to cry, not to let the natural workings of my emotions to happen, that it’s cut off that breaking point. I’m not crying and I’m not reaching that breaking point and so all of what I’m feeling can’t come out. I can’t break and so everything stays in. 

What’s weird though is that I feel like this at various times. I can go periods without feeling like this. Then out of nowhere I have a period of feeling this. I can feel it before I go to bed and then wake up feeling fine.

It’s because of this inconsistency that I’m not sure whether what I’m feeling is something to be concerned about and something I should look at getting help for or whether it’s just some natural feelings that just comes and goes.

I’m not sure what to do. Why am I feeling like this? What do these feelings mean? What are they linked to? 

Can anyone offer any advice?",13Jun2020,3

49,"Quick note: My current plan is to seek treatment, in about 18 months.

I know I have a problem. I show symptoms for multiple eating disorders. I’ll go through months of starving myself, weeks of extreme binge eating, usually followed by months of binging and purging. It’s usually in that order.

I know that treatment is a good thing, and I want to do it, but my family isn’t going to know about this if I have anything to say about this. Because I’m a minor, if I seek treatment now, they’ll legally have to inform my guardians.

Why can’t they know?

Because they’re going through enough shit with my anxiety, depression, and self harm. I’m not tacking on a fucking eating disorder. My mom is already hypervigilant about my arms, and that triggers my anxiety a lot, which then causes a depressive episode. If she started doing that with food then I’d lose it. Not to mention, I just don’t want to put them through that.

So my current plan is to cut down on vomiting as much as possible. Between binging and starving, I likely won’t reach a point of being underweight, but I’ve heard of perfectly healthy teenagers dying of heart attacks because of bulimia, so I’m just going to focus on lessening the throwing up as much as I can.

So basically my plan is to delay treatment or seeking help at all until after I’m 18, and until then to just stop vomiting. Is this a good idea?",13Jun2020,1

I could be bipolar too, but I find it unlikely since the ""manic"" phases are extremely short and fleeting.

Tbh I don't even wanna get better rn, I was just wondering if there was anyone that wanted to complain about life regularly with me. I can send you a message talking shit about my life, you be like ""damn, that sucks"", and sometimes you can send me a message talking shit about your life and I can do the same.

51,"So someone in my life recently discovered he had childhood depression growing up and realized just how much it affected how he grew up and interacted with other kids. He never got the proper socialization a lot of kids get due to it, and now struggles with severe social anxiety from having so little positive interactions with anyone but his family as a kid. 

Thing is, he's an adult now and only just realized that childhood depression is a likely source to a lot of his current issues, but understanding this is only half the battle. He still has depression too but it was finally caught in his adolescence and he has a much better handle on it from therapy and medication.

 We've looked far and wide, but there really doesn't seem to be a whole lot of resources for adults who had undiagnosed childhood depression and now having to cope with that in retrospect, other than a handful of articles saying that childhood depression can cause the problems he's having.

52,"Hi there!

I (18F) am still on my parents' health insurance plan and I get really, really nervous about going into the doctor because I know that even with insurance it's going to cost them money. Fortunately, they can afford it, but I always feel really guilty about it.

Recently, I have noticed the following:

I get in these moods where I'm sad or I feel bad about myself or I hate myself for some reason. It's not all consuming, but it's enough where it's kind of in the back of my mind all the time, even when I am with people and genuinely having a good time.
I also seem to be more forgetful than usual and spacy. Like, I have these random times when I will just zone out even if I have somewhere to be and I'm thinking to myself about how I need to zone back in and get to where I need to be, but I just can't. I zone out a lot in class (which I know is a completely different problem), but in a completely different way. Usually, in class I'll think about something other than that class, but when I zone out randomly, I always think about how I need to zone back in.

I feel like I have been losing interest in the things I care about too. I used to love knitting and reading and going for walks, but now it just feels like a chore and I do them, but I can only focus on them for short periods of time before taking a break or I get no pleasure out of them.

I also am more irritable and short with my family and I always feel bad about it and apologize for it afterwards. With that, I have been also having mood swings, especially at work and around family where one moment I'll be fine and the next I'm just super irritable and mad without anyone actually doing anything to cause it.

Occasionally, I feel like I lack sympathy for others too. Like, my mom doesn't like her current job, but is getting a new one soon, but she comes home and complains about it and gets really upset about it and I just don't care about what happened or that she's upset. And I feel bad about not caring, but then I'll see something sad on the news and it brings me to tears.

I am such an awkward person and I don't know what to say a lot of the time. So a lot of what I say comes out wrong and I find myself constantly thinking about it and obsessing over it afterwards. It got to the point where I would have my parents order for me in restaurants because I was scared of saying the wrong thing, but it probably just made me look weirder. Anyways, then sometimes, I get these passing thoughts saying ""I want to die"" or ""I should just kill myself"" (and this happens with some of the other stuff listed too), but I don't really want to die and I don't think I could ever kill myself. I just want to wake up and just be a happier, healthier, more confident person.

Finally, I just feel kind of lonely. I feel like I want to go out with friends, but I don't have many friends and they're all usually busy with their other friends and I don't like to bother them much because I'm afraid that they'll think I am annoying and clingy or that they just want to hang out with me because they feel bad for me.

I have had these things happen all throughout high school, but kind of brushed it off as hormones, but recently I feel like it's been happening more and more and it makes me really worried.

Is it just being a hormonal teen or is there some underlying issue?

For the past several months, he’s been waking up randomly in the middle of the night with nightmares. He said that he always has these dreams where he’s chained or drowning and similar things. In general, he hasn’t slept a full night without waking up a single time for any reason in a very *very* long time. 

Past that, he never wants to talk about it. We both just graduated college, and when we met, he was incredibly ambitious, but it caused a lot of stress for him as well. He achieved most of his goals but I don’t think that’s done anything to calm him down. 

Not really. Personally, I’ve noticed that this all started in September after he had some sort of “what now” crisis.

He spent all of his freshman through junior year recruiting for internships and that kind of thing. Once he got a full time job offer, he had what I can only describe as a panic attack about how he had nothing left to do. That’s around when all this started.

He says he’s fine, but clearly he’s not right?

56,"So long story short, I studied for 4-5 months straight for 8-10 hours everyday, with no breals, no exercise, no ""fun"" activities. My most days were just: wake up, study, eat,take,shit,sleep and so on although I never compromised on sleep. I slept pretty much for 7-9 hours every night.

Basically I neglected my healthy lifestyle for studying, and now my brain is pretty much fried: headaches, fatigue, sleepiness, exhaustion (no matter how much sleep I get), lack of concentration, you get the idea.

61,"I don’t really know where to start off with this plus I’m still new to this whole reddit stuff. I don’t know where to turn to and I’m hoping to maybe get some answers through here. 

I have this problem where I’m constantly making up these scenarios in my head. These scenarios can range from something so random like me dropping a grape on the ground, running 2 miles and then accidentally stepping on a stick, family member dying, to me harming myself in many ways. The scenarios play out like movies scenes in my head, sometimes they are really short and other times they stay in my head replaying for a good 5 hours. Sometimes these scenarios turn out to be just memories as well and I’ll play them in my head continuously till I feel tired of that memory. Anyways, the reason why these scenarios really affect me is that sometimes I get sucked into them. For example, I’ll have a random scenario about me talking to a friend at school, that friend asks me how I’m doing and I respond with “I’m doing pretty good”. While that scenario is playing in my head, I’m not mentally aware of my surroundings and I forget what I’m doing. I will also start saying out loud what I said in that scenario and not notice at all, sometimes I even do whatever movements I’m doing in that scenario in real life and not notice it till later. I’m sorry if this doesn’t make much sense, I’m not good at explaining. This is scaring me because I’ve notice that I’ve been getting sucked into these scenarios even while driving or at public places. I’ve had to step on the brakes so many times already because I didn’t know where I was at after the scenario played through my head. I just don’t understand, I want to know why this happens to me and what it could be. This has been happening to me since I was little, so at least a good 10 years. Is this something I should take to a professional? I just want help. I need answers please.",13Jun2020,1

64," 

i keep reading about productivity posts and how it’s hard for people to accomplish things these days. i just wanna say that it’s completely fine to be stuck in a rut for days, weeks, etc. just as long as you take little steps each day to take care of yourself.

in my experience, i got used to comparing myself with other people’s achievements that i tend to invalidate my own progress. i learned it the hard way that everyone of us has our own pace. if it takes you a longer time to recover, that’s okay. remember: healing is not linear. it is a process. discipline is a must but cut yourself some slack sometimes.

it is okay to:

1. have a 5-minute shower than having NONE at all.
2. eat late than COMPLETELY skipping meals.
3. brush your teeth for 30 seconds than NOT brushing it at all.

this goes for other things and other dimensions in life as well. if your life has been turned upside down bc of the current crisis, know that it is ok and this is not a productivity competition. if you get to master skills and wake up early everyday, good for you. if you can’t, that’s okay.

you can encounter setbacks and relapses every single day, but what matters is how you respond to it. you don’t necessarily have to suppress your emotions, you can just learn how to acknowledge and control it so it doesn’t control you. :)

it’s hard. i’m sure it is. i know you can do it. hang in there, please. if you can, try to preoccupy yourself with healthy distractions. stimulate your mind by reading books, listening to podcasts, watching documentaries, etc.

70,"Exams is in quotation marks because instead of exams this year they gave us giant fucking assignments bc corona. 

Basically, I have been doing utterly horribly since quarantine started, but even more these past weeks. 

I started quarantine strong, always handing in stuff on time, with work that I felt was good enough to maintain my *stellar* grades. I worked extremely hard the previous semester, and finished it with a 94 average, which is the best I've managed in my life. It was gruelling but worth it. My parents were extremely proud of me, but they don't know how hard it actually was.

Essentially,  I was gifted as a kid, but crossed into average territory by the time I got to 8th grade. In order to keep pleasing my parents with good grades, I started taking caffeine pills to keep myself chemically awake in order to put together super elaborate and detailed projects and assignments. I would only take one pill at most, and only during hell week. 

As quarantine went on, shit got worse and worse and worse. I started getting super suicidal, but didn't want to tell anyone, because I didn't want to endanger my family by making them go to the hospital and possibly get covid. I felt like shit. I pretended to do homework for two weeks, when I was really browsing reddit and doing shit all, and got super behind (though I eventually caught up).

For our ""exams"" we had two weeks to do our final assignments, and I wasted the first one being lazy as shit and unmotivated and generally just mentally ill and unwell. I now have one week left  to complete them, and I managed to get one done by working literal entire nights. I would take a caffeine pill whenever I started getting tired to keep going, and then I would take them throughout the day to stay awake and fool my parents. 

But, I just can't do it anymore. I just can't. My body is giving up on me, the caffeine doesn't even work that well anymore, I have to take such a ridiculous amount to feel awake that I'm scared I'll legitimately overdose. My brain is also just fucked. Can't even think at a normal speed, can't come up with any creative ideas. 

I know I got just fudge them/not hand them in, but my parents will be so disappointed in my marks going down. I need to get my exams *waived*. I have some leeway with the school administration because they know I'm mentally ill. My options are basically: badly attempt suicide, stab myself in the leg with scissors, or throw myself down the stairs and hope I break a bone. It's manipulative but it's my only way out.

77,"This post is just a ramble on something that I find interesting about myself and would like to see if anyone relates. 

Something that I find myself being proud of is how hyper-aware I can be, but more often than not it simply ruins things for me, or at least does so in the moment. 
So far, being observant has caused me to have social anxiety, bully those close to me, have a big mouth, and of course overthink... like, all the time. 

There’s definitely people that balance me out— they can deal with my tendencies, and make me feel heard even when I think no one’s listening to me after a minute. I hold them dear to my heart. 

I’m curious though if anyone has the same trouble when it comes to these things...? Or does no one give a f*** about anything and simply live their day to day life unaffected?

I’ve learned so far that plenty is better left unsaid, my intuition and I are not always right (but we have a damn good percentage rate), and that being ignorant is also very much possible for someone like me. The biggest thing I need to remind myself is to care less. And that mind/matter is a serious deal. Btw, I continue to frequently re-learn mistakes that I make and I’m unsure of how. It takes at least 3x of the same inner-cringe moment to happen to me until I get a hint and note it. It’s almost like I notice everything around me except for myself. 

Being hyper-aware or more observant than the person next to me hasn’t really gotten me anywhere other than impressing some people and making my head twirl. 

I’m working on it every day, and by “it” I mean being more aware of how the things around me affect me as well as affect how I interact with others. I’m a very social and relationship-based person, so when my mind messes with me, it messes with my interactions and quiet honestly makes me feel like a shit person.

83,"I'm struggling to get over how a roommate that I thought was a friend treated me a year ago right before I moved out. I was in a big city with stressful new job and lived with this guy for nearly two years. I helped him out a lot and even gave him rides from work from his own job and paid for some meals of his before he found work since he was saving money. He seemed friendly enough and we played a lot of League of Legends on my PC while I lived with them.

As time was going on and I was getting more and more stressed out from my job he acted more and more disrespectful and dismissive of me. When the time finally came about a year ago that I quit the job and told him I was gonna move back home, he acted like a complete dick for no reason, he horsed around with me a little bit, called me stupid, placed his hand on my shoulder and just gave me this smug look.

I didn't react at the time because I just wanted to pack my stuff and drive home but looking back at how he acted to me that last day has left me angry and bitter, not just at him but towards myself. I regret not distancing myself from him when he started to show signs of being disrespectful but I was stressed out and did't want to believe he was using me for my gaming PC and giving him rides home from work. Now though, I constantly fantasize about bashing his face in when he put his hand on my shoulder.

I just feel like such a doormat still. It's hard to respect myself knowing I just let that asshole act that way towards me. I'm not the confrontational type and he probably sensed that and pushed me around to stroke his own ego. Every day since then there will be a few times throughout the day where I'll involuntarily replay how he acted in my head and my mind just shuts down due to anger and resentment.

I found out he had molested a young girl under the age of 7 within the past few years. I couldn’t believe I fell for every lie he told me about himself and other things regarding me and old friends who he happened to work with. He had been working with minors which was in violation of rules of the sex offender registry. I knew for a fact an old friend of mine trusted him and confided in him so i did reach out and sent her the links of casenet and sex offender registry list with his photo and name. over 24 charges mostly criminal (cooking meth, stalking, abuse, stealing over $5000 multiple accounts and the 10 year sentence wouldnt even say what it was for but was sentenced to prison multiple times but let out early on probation over and over) She could not believe this man had been lying to her and i felt the same way. I wanted to warn her to be careful and he ended up getting fired because he found out she knew and someone addressed him about it and he became angry so the owner fired him for a no call no show the next day when he missed his shift.

91,"Recently I have been wondering if I have a disorder of some kind. I am seeing a therapist, and she often mentions the possibility of certain things, and mentions that I could ""see a psychologist"" or ""get tested for X."" I had actually not realized that she was not the type of therapist that can diagnose you with anything (I see her as an extension of a family member's treatment, so I hadn't looked into it)... but I am actually kind of relieved. Hear me out.

I have always had a clean bill of health. My medical history is all related to fun sports. It's really convenient to just say ""none"" when asked about medical history. I was a paramedic, and I have read countless medical histories... and each one makes you feel some type of way. You get a little snippet into the life of that person. It's totally necessary to treat them effectively. However, I often thought that knowing about the patient's mental health had no effect on my treatment, and it felt a little intrusive to just be on display on their chart like that. I am completely against the stigma against mental health, and yet even in MYSELF I can feel it stirring. I didn't put it there on purpose, I actively do NOT want it there, and yet there it is. It is something we all must fight within ourselves, and it doesn't help anything. The stigma is the reason why people hide their depression. The stigma pushes people to suicide.

And yet... I don't want to give up this snippet into my life. I don't want my mental health on display in some chart that will follow me around for life. My friend recently started menopause and starting having a very strange decline in physical health... and her first doctor literally just asked her, ""What are you doing to treat your depression?"" ... when she isn't even depressed! That was pretty much the entire outcome from that appointment. The doctor assumed that she was depressed because she has symptoms of lethargy. It was ridiculous, but it really made me think.... what kinds of things will doctors assume about a person going forward when they actually DO have a confirmed depression diagnosis? If I have muscle aches and lethargy, I want to be treated for muscle aches and lethargy! This woman doctor literally blew her off because she assumed she had depression.

Of course, there are good doctors and bad doctors everywhere. I just feel really uncomfortable getting a diagnosis, and it's hard to decide that it is worth facing this stigma just to test out the waters for additional treatment options.

So, I'm just doing the best I can with what I got.

Back when she could still visit we just knew we had to go to the same restaurant always, if we changed that we knew she'd get so anxious that she'll get sick (tried and tested, and no she has no clue about this herself).

96,"Hi, so let me start out this post by saying I have anxiety, slight/on and off depression, and are on the autism spectrum. I’ve also had minor cases of anorexia in the past before and it’s slightly on and off. I’ve always been a minor strange case, as when I was a child I tore off ladybug wings and heads for no reason or for fun/because I was bored. In 2019, I am pretty sure I was feeling normal one day and my cat was being annoying, and my hands started to grasp into fists and went to my cat’s neck area. It was as if I was in a trance, and like two seconds later I stopped. In seventh grade, I had a friend who came back from a mental hospital and she described it as being a fun place, and I was kinda curious about what it was like so I started to mimic her behavior a bit so I can go to one. However, it was also a mix of real suicidal thoughts and feelings as my life sucked at the time and I hated it. I think I may have even tricked myself into believing it. Long story short, I’ve been on Zoloft since all of that went down, and I rarely have suicidal thoughts anymore. I didn’t end up going to a mental hospital because I got the help I needed. However, I still think something is up with me, as I sometimes get thoughts of murdering people but fortunately, they vanish. I sometimes think about how if I become friends with someone, how I can use them for my benefits and vice versa. I enjoy horror stuff and blood and gore don’t really phase me unless it’s super intense and genuine or on animals. I also sometimes fantasize about being raped by someone cute or getting kidnapped and/or raped by them. What does all of this mean about my mental health/state? Am I a sociopath?",13Jun2020,1
97,"I've honestly started to feel like my mental health has just become an added burden on those I thought were close enough to me to not make me feel this way perhaps... However here I am, and I can honestly say for the past few weeks I haven't feel this lost or lonely is quite while. Crazy thing is (fingers crossed) I'll be getting married in a few weeks and so being so involved in prep and just all that overwhelming stress to deal with, like I don't think I should be feeling this way, however being in a high stress situation hasn't been good for me at all especially when I can't exactly take time away for myself. Now when I try to share my stress I'm practically adding it to others and being made aware of it (rightfully so), but that's just instilled this increased amount of guilt with me. Going from someone who bottled up to someone who opened up my can of worms, I honestly feel like atleast when I bottled , it didn't affect anyone. It was fine. I may have not been, but everyone else was. I never felt like I was stepping on toes now here I am wanting to speak and even if I do, instantly regretting opening my mouth. I'm not too sure what to do about this feeling but with so much going on internally im having a huge issue in terms of processing my emotions (am I being selfish by saying my emotions?) This has also caused an extreme feeling of relapsing physically and mentally, between lack of sleep and certain habits I thought I had overcome over the past few years ... Just want to feel like actually better without worrying so much.",13Jun2020,1
98,"When I was younger, I use to hit myself when I did poorly in a video game. I could not release my frustrations. This got worse as I grew older. When I made a mistake on a test, I would hid my head over the counter for every mistake I got wrong. My parents, naturally, got me to a counselor. For years I stopped. 

Then suddenly, since the quarantine started, it got worse. I wouldn’t stop crying for a week straight. I stapled my pinky. I hit my thighs with a steel rod. I have a good life, but I go to happy to depressed in seconds. I throw up over small mistakes. 

Here, take a post that I just posted to r/advice:

~~~

I posted a joke post on Reddit, people took it seriously and now I’m scared that my entire future could be at stake.

About five hours ago I posted to r/amitheasshole (wait for it), the backstory of Snape from Harry Potter. I made him a science teacher and everything. In this post, I said that I yelled and perhaps even slapped a child.

People didn’t see it, and were probably rightfully calling me a terrible person. I messaged ever commenter back saying that it was a joke.

But what if one of them called the police? I could get a criminal record, and never achieve my lifelong dream of becoming an actual teacher myself.

I haven’t been able to sleep. I threw up from the sheer fear half an hour ago. When I do fall asleep I have nightmares and wake up. I’m terrified.

I’ve always thought myself as a good person, I was just trolling a bit, having fun. I’m debating on deleting my Reddit account.

Thanks

Edit: I just threw up again. I need someone to answer, please. I don’t know if you think this is serious or not, but my mental health is not in the best place right now.

My parents think it’s something to just get over. I don’t know, but I suspect I must be bipolar or something.

Oh, and if anyone could help me with my advice post, I would love that.

I can’t go to counseling in quarantine. I can’t function, I haven’t slept in over 40 hours really. Everytime I do, I weak up in a cold sweat with an urge to throw up.

102,"So today I was diagnosed with social anxiety and a few other things but this one is a huge one for me. I’m like crying uncontrollably. I’m doing my apprenticeship in hairdressing so obviously my work has always been hard for me. 
Like I sweat ALOT or I twist my hands. I need to be pushing myself forward and jumping on more things but I can’t. I’m an underachiever and I think it’s okay until I get home and than I kick myself. 
I’ve left myself to myself for so long it’s pretty severe. I no longer leave the house at all unless it’s for work my boyfriend does shopping solo. I don’t have any friends and that’s because I can’t message first or even if they do I don’t reply, I get scared to open them because I think everyone is mad at me all the damn time. 
I sometimes stay up all night and turn up HOURS before work even starts because I think I forgot to turn something off or I’ve left a mess somewhere and if my manager sees I will lose my job. 
I go in every single day thinking I’m on my last straw.
 I don’t want to lose this, hair is my life long dream and I’m letting myself down 
It’s  so bad, My boyfriend tries to help but it’s not his responsibility. 
I don’t want to try feel better about this because at the moment I need to just be sad and let all this sink in it’s nice knowing I have an answer now and I’m going to get help where I can (I work across 2 salons I really genuinely don’t have a lot of time)  
I just needed to let it out to people that don’t know me because I’m not sure how to tell people and I’m not sure if I want to tbh. I’m meant to be a hairdresser I don’t want to bother my workplace and make them feel like they have to adjust for me or even just straight up fire me because I can’t do some services already simply because I shake so bad and it’s obviously uncontrollable.",13Jun2020,2

106,"Hi 
I have a couple of questions about this topic.
Tale a quick look at these articles:

[Article 1](https://www.wealthfit.net.au/latest-articles/top-7-foods-that-boost-serotonin)

[And two](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nutritionprovisions.com/blog/2019/10/7/growing-wild-black-walnuts-a-rich-source-of-serotonin%3fformat=amp)

Q1: So I’ve heard you need to consume “tryptophan” or “5-htp” rich foods, and these chimicals will later convert to serotonin in your body. 

So are they wrong for writing (for example) “ The serotonin concentration of black walnuts is ........ “ (and they meant for tryptophan or 5htp) or they really mean that serotonin come straight up from these foods ?

Q2: I’ve searched a lot over the internet for foods with the highest  concentration of serotonin and almost every website tells a different answers. 
What food really contains the highest amount ?",13Jun2020,1
107,"Short version at the bottom:

I haven’t fully come to terms with what happened to me yet but because of the person who did it I know 100% it’s not normal/okay.... I hate what happened to me every single time I think about it and for some reason i call myself a liar and make it hard to believe myself when i know I would never lie about such a thing.... I remember the feel I remember the disgust I remember the shock afterwards the fear feeling dirty all the time and so many other little things... but... when it happened, ( I fucking hate saying this) i think I physically enjoyed it? Emotionally I hated it and it scared me it was wrong. In fact I live with the person who did it... does what happened to me though no longer happened because I physically enjoyed it?

Short version: I was sexually abused by a family member as a kid and it feels awful. However I physically enjoyed it... does what happened to me no longer matter and is it suddenly okay?",13Jun2020,1
108,"the first time i had depression and suicidal thoughts was when i was 15 (i'm 18 now). after that even though i still had the ocassional suicidal thought, i've mostly been fine up until recently. 

life's been giving me L after L and i used to handle them pretty well by turning to my friends but now with quarantine i can't talk to anyone face to face. i've been getting anxiety attacks that eat me up inside and suicidal thoughts keep coming to my head and it's really distracting me from school and my family. i threw my computer away last year to focus on the books so i can't play games with my friends, and with the courts closed i can't shoot hoops with them either. the only thing i can turn to right now is music and even that gets frustrating sometimes.

im not sure how much more of this i can take because it's my final year of high school and these grades are important and i don't wanna do stupid things like self harm or suicide. but i'm also hesitant on seeing a professional because:
1) i'm hoping that once quarantine is over i'll be back to normal
2) i've never seen a professional before and i don't want to be reliant on such help

109,My mental health has been declining rapidly lately. I'm scared I'll be admitted to a mental hospital. I NEED to know what it's like. I'm living in fear. Please please please help me.,13Jun2020,1
110,"It's weird how so much time can pass without it feeling like it's gone by that quickly. 2020 started out a bit bad but February 2nd was the real beginning of the downward spiral for me, everything else that happened around me just seemed to add to the fact that 2020 is the worst year I've experianced.  


Now...unlike some people here who have serious issues and reasons for posting I don't really think my situation is all that bad. I don't have suicidal thoughts, I don't self harm, and I haven't lost hope/faith. Most of my fears though have been confirmed true and getting over that truth hasn't been easy.  


Even before this new year started I had trouble involving my friends on Discord...I played DnD with a specific group some of which I'd known for almost 3 years while the others I'd known for about 1. Most of what happened is foggy as my memory normally isn't great with details but the gist was a number of them were tired/fed up with me as a DM and a few didn't like me as a person...but a few of them were hypocrites about things even if those things were true.   


I got emotional and I make stupid choices when I'm emotional and I left our main servers...a day or two later I asked to come back since I wasn't thinking straight and well...I was told no and that I should take some time away from the group so things could calm down. About a week later they brought me back in but at the time I didn't know that it was out of pity which I say is on them. Be honest and just tell me that you need more time, don't pity me and cause more issues by letting me back early.  


Anyways the entire time leading up to feburary was riddled with anxiety, insecurity, and a lot of deceit/lies. I agreed to better myself even if I didn't think I needed bettering and three people promised to help. Every time I'd ask if I was making progress I'd get a ""Yeah you're doing fine, no issues."" then when I finally pressed a friend of mine he admitted that yes there was a problem and he didn't wan't to say cause he only did it to get me to stop complaining (which was the issue he had) and that should have given me the idea that others were lying as well.  


Jump to the day things went to shit and well it was superbowl day, I had nothing to do, and I messaged my friends asking if they wanted to play a game together. All said they were busy/had other plans or they had to go into town. Later I learn from one of my friends that they were playing a game that I was never told about or invited to. Not being invited wasn't the issue as I understood why, DM wanted a minimal number of players.  


But not straight up telling me that you already had something planned made me feel super insecure, as if they didn't want me knowing or something. So I talked with someone I thought I could confide in and turns out she'd been sharing everything we'd talked about to them which eventually caused the DM to end the game and confront me despite my wishes to wait till my emotions weren't all over the place.  


We had a long discussion in private with the other people and they said I had made no progress on being better despite telling me multiple times when I asked that I had. Another person said they honestly never liked me and only pretended to be my friend so as not to hurt my feelings, and a bunch of other stuff.  


In the end they decided a temporary separation was needed and that I could come back possibly when things died down. Thing is...after a month I asked a friend if they thought I'd ever be able to come back and they side that it was likely not going to happen.  


Soon after learning this my GF at the time comes and tells me she wants a break and later she admits it was a lie to see if I'd notice she was serious about leaving. We finally broke up and are now trying to rework a friendship but...I can't help but miss her and I have trouble thinking of ever being with someone else.  


All of this while going to college and then going into quarantine. I lost all those close to me and had only 1 person to keep me company during all this. Things were rough, emotions were strange, and I just...idk couldn't cope. I desperately miss everyone while also feeling wronged due to the lies.  


Now it's 5 months later and I'm doing much better but I recently learned my friend, the DM of the group I got kicked from, is going to run a new game soon and I asked to join. But unless 1-2 players decide to not join that game I cant play. I'm completely restricted from spending time and playing games with my closest friends because a few people don't like me...I can't be wrong in thinking I got the short end of the stick right?  


Other than that I just find myself thinking about my ex and my old friends...what does one do after losing what equates to a 1 in a million group of friends and girlfriend? Sometimes I'm at a loss for what to do or how to move forward.  


Somehow after getting over most of the pain it's even harder now. So how does one move forward? I tried making amends with everyone but that didn't work the first time and now this second time they really have no reason to respond/talk to me again. With my Ex she's just content with her life being work, home, eat, sleep, then work again with GED school on the horizon...but I can't forget her or try to put my feelings aside when talking to her. Sadly I have no real experience to work from with these situations so I have no idea how to handle them without forgetting/ignoring the feelings.  


So yeah...thats my 5 month update. have a wonderful Saturday everyone and remember the Keep Moving Forwards.",13Jun2020,1

112,"(16F, any advice is really appreciated I seriously need it)

I would never in my life make something like this up. I also know myself and that I have a problem acknowledging trauma and things that happened to me because I create excuses and justify the behavior to make it okay.

Some things I know have happened. 
1) He frequently has full on grabbed my ass from a young age and continued through my teenage years despite the times I told him to stop and it made me uncomfortable. He would go out of his way to grab it even would rush across the house if i was bending over to put away a plate to grab it. He would walk next to me to do it too. He would even wait where he thinks he could get away with this. He only stopped grabbing my ass when my older brother moved back in. I just realized the last thing and that really bothers me

2) He’s wrestled with me alone in the pool when I was 14. My memory of this is a bit blurry but I remember being uncomfortable and weirded out afterwards. I think he may have purposefully grabbed my chest or something.

3) He has often complimented me by calling me hot. I also catch him staring at my chest and my butt.

4) He has had many instances where he was mad at me and tried to make me feel like i was out of line and “being a bitch” when he would try to come in my room while i was naked and changing and screaming at him to get out. He said I was a bitch and screamed at me because he was “just trying to tell me something super fast”

5) He’s made jokes about me masturbating because it was relevant to something said on the radio. Why would he joke about that? It genuinely disturbed me for one because thats gross and out of line, and two, because It was true and i did it in the shower but i was veryyyy very quiet about it I highly doubt it was obvious.

6) last spring break he took us to six flags, he grabbed my ass throughout the trip and would say WHAT? all confused when I would say stop it. He would rest his hand there and move it on along with me. Can’t believe nobody said anything. At the hotel pool in order to shove me past people he pushed me by my ass into the elevator and kept his hand their.

7) for a whole year he woke me up in the morning by grabbing my ass when i slept on my side and shaking it roughly

8) Theres just been some questionable activity all around and i dont know if some things I haven’t said are innocent mistakes or actual weird things. Part of me thinks I believe its weird because i worry about it due to other stuff.

Now here is where i have a-lot of issues...

Recently I’ve been in a bad mental spot and relieved a lot of old trauma, being beaten as a little kid, having my dad threaten to kill me and my mom, my dad being a horrible alcoholic, my mom being a hardcore drug addict and telling me I was the reason she was going to kill herself... just a lot of ugly things. It’s taken time but lately I’ve been reflecting on life and realizing my mom is an abuser too but that is irrelevant, this about my dad and POTENTIAL sexual abuse.

While I was reflecting I began to recount old things listed here and immediately got grossed/creeped out about my dad and his questionable activity. I thought about certain things and they made me question if he hurt me as a young child and I had just forgotten about this until now... 

It started by recounting childhood behavior, me and my dad were never close he was a ghost for the whole ten years where things went “right” (pre divorce) I remembered alot of times where he discreetly grabbed my ass without my mom seeing and him catching me masturbating and staying in my room, looking outside to see if his work people were home from my bedroom (he always had to check through my window) he looked at me, then i think walked out nonchalantly. Idk why i feel that it’s weird he caught me masturbating but the fact he stayed so long cause it took me a sec to realize he was their is what kinda weirds me out. 

Next is that I was a very hypersexual kid from the age of like 7. I did stuff alot.

My dad always gave me weird vibes when I lived with him, he always creeped me out but i could never place why.

He was always obsessed with my physical image and I remember him pushing me into a mirror when i was about 8 telling me no boy was ever gonna love me if i got fat. He told me I needed to start losing weight if i wanted to be loved later in life.

In elementary school I remember waking up and having some kind of “fluid” in my pants and I remember even as a kid worrying if it was mine and how it happened. 

I can remember a lot of things in my childhood with great detail but some spots are just very very blurry with vague memories of him. 

For some reason i have a bath memory, i have no idea how young I was of him and my mom talking about me holding my breath under water because my dad really wanted me to learn and begin swim practice and since my mom had a fear he wanted to show me it was okay. And I remember after she left and he stayed. Honestly thats not weird idk why im sharing just Im surprised I remember being young enough to where it was acceptable my dad saw me naked in a bathtub. For some reason i have weird thoughts of him doing stuff to me after but i feel like im lying to myself

For some reason i have weird other memories where i think im lying to myself about him hurting me. The only reason i think i am maybe lying to myself is because i only “remembered” these things once I got stressed about thinking he maybe hurt me as a kid.

I have multiple “memories” 

One of him touching me privately in the car.

One of him grabbing me down below during that time at the pool

That time in the bathtub as a kid

And one i am very very unsure about in my room at night 

I think once he maybe made me touch his dick.

Some of these memories feel more real than others yet all are pretty blurry and strange. Some i can remember vividly from the touch and the disgust during and after and i can remember feeling constantly dirty and disgusted by myself from a young age. I have never felt completely clean and it feels wrong any time i touch myself. I also struggle with saying no in consensual sexual events. I’ve also had reoccurring dreams about being touched innapopriatly the other day even being my dad himself doing what was in a “memory”. 

Despite the reasons i listed above i still feel like im lying to myself about the REAL sexual abuse like fingering. I know for sure he gropped me and felt me up but i dont know about that one and it is what truly disturbs me. I haven’t felt the same since I’ve had nightmares and remembered these things. I feel though like im only thinking or making this up for myself because i worried about it so much. 

So my main question is this.... Am i making this up? Why would I? Is this some form of repressed trauma coming out? Is it normal to lie about these things to yourself and they never happened?

Thank you for reading this post if you did, advice would be really appreciated because im only sixteen and I don’t have anybody i can talk to. Thank you again.",13Jun2020,1
113,"Yesterday I experienced a feel that I haven't experienced in a while. It was a day full of stressful events therefore I was already really stressed and tired, my mind was desperately looking for a moment full of peace and relax.

But after my partner started an argument, I really felt devastated and like I was mentally tortured. I immediately came to a point I didn't have the strength to discuss or event maintain a conversation, and I continued to regularly look into the distance in a sort of apathetic state for hours. It's like  my mind couldn't handle anything, and until I went home I didn't talk with my partner and even one simple question was too much for me.

When I just came back home, and I was alone, I started to feel a lot of anger but I felt so tired that I could just curse randomly about all the annoying things that happened, and I felt totally worn out until I went  to bed.

Today I still feel mentally tired and when I think about yesterday my stomach hurts, my heart beats faster and I feel even more exhausted.

But how is this feeling called? It's obviously something related to excessive stress but is there a specific name for this?",13Jun2020,1

115,"1. I worry a lot. Worry the things I say will hurt/offended someone. Worry that things I do create a bad impression on me. When I have issue with someone (work/relationship), I don't dare to voice out because it &amp; the problems will keep getting worst due to unfairness or stuff like that.  


2. I have heavy dreams every single night and remember them when I wake up. I usually wake up unrested and exhausted. The dream is very vivid, sometimes I can control what I do in the dream and the shittiest part is, the conversation inside the dream is sometimes very loud. Not screaming type of loud but as if the voice is inside my ear.  


3. Most of the day &amp; night, my brain goes into autopilot thinking/conversation mode. Even before sleep. My head inner voice won't stop talking. It's usually a conversation with myself/someone else trying to solve a problem/situation. That might or will not even happen. A lot ""what if"" scenario keep playing inside my head.   


Most of the times, situation that has something to do with ""unfairness"", will trigger the whole never-ending thought process. Whether it be unfairness at work, relationship or third party.  


4. I'm always tired because of my brain activity which affects my work. Making me sitting/standing up straight require extreme effort.  


5. When I'm reading/typing something, my inner head voice that's reading it makes me really exhausted. Like when I'm typing out this right now.

6. I used to have constant sleeping paralysis back in college time due to extreme stress but it rarely happens now eventhough when I'm stress.  


There are a lot more but these are just some that really gets me most of the time. I've been having these issue for 10 years+ but it's getting more serious and affecting my work physically &amp; mentally.  


I tried very simple meditation (maybe I'm doing it wrong) and my mind instantly stray away to it's usual 'infinite thinking'

I just want my inner voice to shut up and let me rest in peace. For many years, I keep telling myself I'm just stress and everybody have anxiety. I never bring up to anyone or classified myself to have anxiety because I'm afraid that it will be an excuse for myself to not solve my problems.

119,"I had a best friend for a little over three  years who I lived with for a year, and then again for 4 months when we got accepted into the same school. We became inseparable and she was like the sister I never had. I told her everything. She never made me feel ashamed of myself. I could be whoever I wanted to be when I was with her. And she was always there for me.

6 months ago, I found out that she had been saying horrible things about me throughout our entire friendship. Things about my family, finances, where I come from, my home, my fiancé, and my intelligence. It was awful and broke my heart. I confronted her and she moved out without an apology. Haven't spoke in 6 months.

I wonder how she is doing or if she misses me, because I really did care for her. It hurts my heart every single day that she said such terrible things about me. And it hurts my heart more that she never apologized. I know an apology won't even help anything. It's not like we could be repaired now.

But in my dream, we were. Then it ended again. She moved all of her things out and this time criticized me for caring so much. She was sweeter and apologized in the dream too. Idk, it just makes me really sad. still. 6 months later. I fucking miss my friend. We used to listen to the same music everyday and get so excited to show each other new music. We went to three concerts in 4 months of living together. It was so fun. We celebrated her birthday like crazy and we celebrated my engagement. We went to every class together. And we were just crazy and fun and best friends. And I miss it.

How do I get over this? Why does it even hurt so much?",13Jun2020,1
120,"I’ve been in therapy since kindergarten, I  struggled with my mental health for as long as I can remember, and I have five different diagnoses. Point is: I’ve struggled a lot. My parents were never a source of comfort. My dad is emotionally absent and my mom has always been a tough love kind of person. But years ago one of my therapists told my mother something that would make their lack of empathy even worse: don’t let her wallow in situations. Which my parents took to mean, do not listen to her, do not tell her what I crave to hear the most, “everything is gonna be okay,”, do not talk her through anything. I had a mental breakdown this fall and ended up hospitalized, I told my mom that more than anything I just wanted her to love me and comfort me. Just give me a hug without me having to ask and rub my back. And she say that was coddling. Just now I almost relapsed due to a lack of sleep and not taking my pills last night and outside world stressors. I came out of my room sobbing and telling them how I felt and then they said well you did this to yourself (which I can agree with) and I need to deal with it myself. I told them that I wanted them to love me and comfort me and I told them exactly what I wanted. And my mom just said well I can’t give that to you. I went back in my room and bad thoughts filled my head and I heard my mom say that I’m un fucking believable. I screamed at her saying I just want a hug (I know not smart) and started to have an anxiety attack. While I was freaking out my dad came downstairs to tell me that I was incredibly rude. I couldn’t take it anymore and yelled for him to take some stuff so I don’t do anything.

122,My SO suffers from depression and anxiety. Something I knew from the beginning. He’s done ok managing it and I’ve been there to try and help him whatever way I can. I do a lot for him to try and make things as easy as I can. But then some days his anxiety and depression gets so bad. I think covid has affected him a lot with everything being different and closed. His anxiety and depression have been really bad since it started. I try and be understanding but it just gets on my nerves sometimes. I try and understand but I just can’t and it annoys me. Idk if I’m annoyed more with myself for feeling like sometimes I just want to leave him and be free. But then I feel bad and tell myself it’ll pass. I really do love him.

124,"I’ve always felt like there was something wrong, but I REALLY want to believe the things I’m experiencing are normal. 

1. I never seem to have the same level of confidence each day. And this isn’t a result of anything really. It just changes. One day I feel really confident, then I’ll wake up the next day feeling like a shy 13 year old who cant talk to anyone.
2. This links into the first point. My voice is never the same. One day it’s deep and strong, the next day it’s broken and soft, and I can barely get words out without my voice croaking and breaking mid sentence. When it’s in a ‘weak state’, I avoid talking altogether because its just embarrassing hearing my voice sound so strained.
3. My mood changes dramatically randomly. I can be really positive for a week or two, then out of nowhere I’ll have a few days of feeling dead. For no reason. Staring at nothing. Zoning out. Not wanting to be doing anything. And then when it goes away its a sort of ‘oh hey, I’m back. What was that all about lol’.
4. I’m generally really bitter and annoyed most of the time, but in the moment I’m completely aware of it. I just cant get out of it. Like ‘why am i so angry right now? What’s going on?’ Yet I cant change it. 
5. Sometimes I switch into this dream state where I feel like nothing matters and that this is all fake. It’s a borderline out of body experience and it’s pretty scary whenever it happens. 

I think I might be bipolar, but I’ve talked to a doctor and he said it’s probably stress or depression. I’m going to a psychologist soon, but the problem is I always feel different. So I could very well see someone and talk it all down like its nothing, only to realise the next day that I essentially lied. Right now I’m in a state where I can acknowledge my issues and share them online. Any help is appreciated.",13Jun2020,1

I chose unhappiness, I've been going through a stressful period and I needed to let it out. I let all the sadness inside completely tale over. And then I sat and looked at everyone. I could tell my expression was hard to read for them and a few seconds later, I started getting the urge to laugh. A lot of them were smiling too and I genuinely started laughing. At some point, their faces got more serious again and I was the only one left laughing. Out of the blue, my face and mood started dropping faster than I thought was possible and I nearly started crying. It startled me and I snapped out of it, in some state between laughing and crying. What could this mean? Why did a feeling of sadness provoke honest laughter in me? Or did I just pick up the energy from others?",13Jun2020,1
128,"I (M, 19) have been diagnosed with ADHD, Asperger's, and autism, although I am *very* low on the spectrum. I can handle things for myself, etc. But that's not what this is about. I think it might have something to do with my ADHD.

So for all my life I've shown small bits of ADHD to myself and others (I've been professionally diagnosed for years). I would do the simple things like maybe counting how many steps are on a set of stairs in my head, that sort of thing. Over the years I feel it's gotten a bit worse.

Every now and then I would have issues where I sort of ""want things to be equal"", to put it somewhat simply. It would happen only every now and then, but it seems to have been almost taking me over this past month, happening pretty much every day.

Let me give an example of ""being equal"". Sometimes I'd, say, take a step with my left foot with a certain amount of pressure. I'd then take one with my right, but with less pressure than the other. Immediately my mind goes to: ""Oh no, you didn't use the same amount of pressure in that foot! Let's try again."" So then subconsciously I take a second step with that foot, trying to match the pressure. But then I'd do ""too much"" or stack it with the other pressure. Then my brain goes ""No, no, no! You have to now take another step with your LEFT foot to balance it out!!""

I think you can see where this is going. It even happens to me when playing video games; I turn 360 degrees to the left, but then feel I have to do another 360 to the right, and etc., etc.

I take medicine for my ADHD and it's helped me all these years, but this sudden spike has just come out of nowhere. I feel like it's ruining me. Whenever it happens, my body just feels... ""incomplete"" to say the least of I don't balance anything properly. Does anyone know what might be happening to me? Is this a normal thing for people with ADHD? Is there any sort of mind exercises that I can do to help with this?

Thank you in advance, and I hope I explained this well enough.",13Jun2020,5
130,"Just last month, we were begging people to show empathy towards us and others but that has since been forgotten. NOW I go on Social Media platforms and I see nothing but attacks towards people ""for the greater good."" 

Let it be noted that these attacks are targeted towards individuals who struggle with mental health issues. Anxiety attacks, Panic attacks, mental break downs on a regular basis, social anxiety disorder, depression and the list goes on. And that negativity still affects those who aren't directly targeted.

Covid-19 has already put a toll on people's lives especially those who struggle with their mental health. We've all had a disgusting year so far. A possible war happening, fires, a deadly virus, numerous notable deaths and now protests across the world to bring systematic change. This novel coronavirus has been sparking an increase in mental health issues for individuals across the world and pushing people who have had preexisting conditions to go over the edge. That is why it is extremely important to possess empathy for the people around us no matter the situation we are in.

But that has been thrown out the window. We've created a toxic world where the only way you've truly shown your support to any cause is through social media. It's as if people forget that there are other reasons why an individual would not get political even outside of business reasons, especially on those platforms. Not informed enough, fear of being attacked by people who oppose them,  don't want to post about something they've done to give this idea that they did it under false altruism or simply, they don't want to get into politics because of how detrimental that may be towards their mental health. But yet we attack people online. Celebrities, influencers, notable people or ANYONE who haven't posted anything simply because of the aforementioned. 

We assume that they've chosen to be neutral and assist the oppressor simply because they refused to put up the trendy hashtag or ""ruin their aesthetic."" When in fact, they're probably trying to get educated and assist the cause in REAL life. 

""But publicity helps,"" one would surely argue. That's true but not everyone is cut out to enter  things that are political. Politics contributes to a lot of emotions but happiness is surely not one of them. 

The thing that pisses me off the most is the fact that a lot of these self righteous ""I care about people"" hypocrites go after teenagers with mental health issues who are still figuring out their life because they have millions of followers. Emma Chamberlain is a notable example. An individual who has shown signs of underlying mental problems directly or indirectly but most importantly is quite young and is being bullied on social media for not getting political during a mentally daunting pandemic. We see the numbers but we forget the human and We most importantly forget who we were in the past and who we are in other situations. 

And not everything is false altruism. Brad Leone was basically accused of that recently when he said he would try his best to create a better environment for his POC colleagues and numerous people came to attack. ""It's not about you Brad."" He knows that. He's trying to acknowledge the problem and assist. 

A toxic mentality I've seen recently amongst those that are part of this community is the fact that they are a benchmark. ""I have social anxiety and I don't behave like that."" ""I have OCD and I don't act like that."" Crap like that pisses me off.

WE ARE NOT PERFECT , I AM NOT PERFECT AND THOSE PEOPLE YOU PUT UP ON A MANTLE AND WORSHIP AREN'T EITHER.  THE ONLY THING ANYONE TRULY HAS IN COMMON IS HYPOCRISY. 

Context matters, Objectivity matters, Black Lives Matter (because too many of them have died for absolutely no reason) but let's not start attacking people because we ASSUMED they didn't do anything or did something for false altruism or because they do not want to get into politics for their well-being. That type of behaviour is illogical, lacks empathy and must stop. We must remember that there is a human behind that profile picture and we must treat them like we would've treated them in real life if the same topic and situation came up. Educating, contradicting, encouraging and empathizing peacefully would've surely been used then. 

Thanks to the few that read. I was obsessing over this and needed to vent to get it out. Sign those petitions, make sure those schools get funded and be empathetic as much as possible. Peace.",13Jun2020,1

141,"Ive been thinking lately that im not normal. I wanna know if im just thinking too much or perhaps im just an edgelord.

Warning: long read

I was abused a lot when i was younger, no sexual abuse, just beatings from my parents, they intimidated me a lot, most of the times they beat me for what i did wrong but i dont remember anything anymore, i only remember they beat me a lot and i was constantly terrified by it and i was a nice kid, i studied hard and got top in my school every year, im quiet and dont cause any troubles at school. But i was so shy that i didnt like the thought of letting a stranger/teacher see me speak, so i never actually spoke in front of a teacher.

Anyway, i got beatings here and then, sometimes my parents would get into arguments and my mom would cry, it was chaotic. Then i witnessed my mom fight her sister, i think they threw some glass stuff at each other, her sister banged her own head til blood came out so that when the police arrived shed look like the victim. I witnessed all those as a child. 

Up til 11 or 12 years old im getting suicidal thoughts from the abuse and how much better they treated my younger brother. i also harmed myself a few times, at 12 i had an incident where my friend sent me porn and we got caught by the discipline mistress, she told our parents and told many of my teachers, all my innocent, quiet boy image was gone. Ive never felt so ashamed in my life before, i wasnt even addicted to it, it was just a joke kind of thing. The experience made me unable to eat or have energy for a few days, i didnt even feel like participating in my favourite lesson. Anyway i did many bad stuff when i was 12, i destroyed school property, i was obsessed with fire, i tore up little insects legs, i burnt ant nests. Up til now i sometimes get random flashbacks of that incident and i wanna skin and torture the discipline mistress.

Around the age of 14, i started to lose my empathy and happiness, im not sentimental anymore. i feel really really angry about stuff and i lose my temper, i have to say it is very unlike me. From young til 14, i was self controlled, the calmest person youve ever seen and i had empathy for others, i was a nice guy with emotions and morals. But when i was turning 15 it slowly changed. I wasnt having empathy, i didnt care whatever happened to my friends, i started having 0 moral sense. I basically have no morals now. I lied to a girl who confessed to me that i liked her too, just so i can get advantage. It was all normal and good, i was having friends and all and my lack of empathy doesnt affect anything, to others im just a normal guy. Slowly, lately, ive been having angry thoughts, i feel like hurting people(not specifically someone), but i will never do it because i dont want to go to jail. 

However the abusing stopped when i was around 13-14. But they still continue to intimidate me if they feel impatient/ angry because of what ive said or done.(until recently i talked them into not being such impatient compulsive parents) but things were not the same anymore, i will never see them differently and i dont like my family.

Some side stuff thats been bothering me: ive always had difficulty sleeping as a kid, im slightly paranoid about many things, like whether if someone is genuinely nice or not, i think up of why people are doing something nice. I dont trust them. And also eye contact is devastating for me, now im improving on it but i feel uneasy. 

Ive been thinking this may be a psychological defense mechanism for me to cope with my life, am i in any way mentally sane and normal? Is it just a developing brain?
Do i need to seek help? But actually i cant seek help, my family is tight on finances.",13Jun2020,1

143,"After talking to a friend about d.i.d. (wich was a wonderful conversation) I started thinking. There are some cases of people who lie compulsively. Some even lie about their past or who they are.

If a person were to 'invent' a whole diffrent personality while talking to a stranger online, for example a person with a diffrent name, age, gender, sexuality, personality or a mixture of any of those. Would we still just talk about pathological lying or do you consider it something more?

The interesting part of it for me is how they lie. Because they are fully aware of the fact they are lying (example given, they say they are taking a walk but are laying in bed) or they are fully aware that they aren't another gender or age. While in a lot of other disorders its specified that they don't know.
Another example could be that they are afraid of their abusive father while they never were abused.

147,"Hey there. I wasn't quite sure where to post it so I'll give it a try here. I'd appreciate you suggesting me more appropriate subs for it.

According to my psychologist, I may have had ED as a teenager. I thought it was gone for good but I started dieting and old behaviours came back - starving, bingeing, purging, excessive workouts and such.

However, neither then nor now, it wasn't purely about being thinner. Especially now; I don't want to be extremely skinny, healthy weight would be fine. But I use a scale as a tangible proof of my self worth. I feel ecstatic when I lose weight and depressed when I gain it back. 

I'm a perfectionist. Gaining weight despite my efforts to lose it feels like the greatest failure. My stepfather's snarky remarks (""haha you're a cruiserweight"" for example) make me feel even more inferior and insecure. 

I don't really want to go down this way again. It's extremely hard because my psychologist's office is closed due to lockdown. However, I have a psychiatrist appointment in a few days and maybe I should tell her.

It'll probably take some time before I'm professionally diagnosed so I'd be grateful for your perspective for now.",13Jun2020,20

I studied but in my dad's eyes he feels like everything that I do is not enough, and sadly if I work on getting myself better it does not show up, or something gets in the way like for example, I wanted to leave the country because there is no hopes here where I live, and I wanted to continue my major outside in Germany, but Germany wants the German language to be learned at a B level, so I said to my self that I will study it in an institution, but I showed up late, and they told me to wait 3 months to put my name on the list, but then in these 3 months a revolution started in my country and they did not accept any new students, after that the virus came and they completely shut down the program. sadly there are no other options and my dad thinks that I was the one late for not coming up to them earlier.   
and now, being a 2nd-semester mechanical engineer, trying to pursue my passion for cars, my dad is constantly pushing me to ""change my major"" because my GPA is not in the 3.5+ I have an average of 2.8.  
this really kills any motivation I have. and I don't think I will be able to continue like that. I am not the best and I know it, but at the same time, I cannot pretend to be something I am not. I love engineering, I love cars. but I hate how I've been treated.

156,"I cant quite describe it, but I feel there is a problem. I'm not suicidal, so don't worry about that, but something is going wrong in my head. I have been extremely irritable and when drinking I have strange delusions. I don't remember any of it, but I end up contacting family or friends and telling them about it and it is absolutely insane. It is like I am having visions or something. Some of my friends are getting worried. I know I shouldn't be drinking if this sort of thing is happening, but it just started happening. I feel like there is just something wrong and it's pushing to the edge, but I can't describe it. There is just a problem.

It seems to be a result of the COVID-19 lockdown because this has never happened before and I am almost 30. I live in a small apartment in NYC and have been extremely isolated.

158,"I had a situation where I fell out with a cousin a year ago after I hurt her and she completely stabbed me in the back. I was living with her at the time and she said she wanted for me to be honest with her about my job and I was, but she was upset because she didn’t like the legal job that I had was degrading. I owned up to and apologized to her for hurting her and I completely understand that she would be mad and have things to say. But she used her anger to bring up every private and personal thing that I’ve ever told her and tell me about how I was using the emotional abuse that I’ve went through as a child as an excuse to be lazy. At the time of the fallout, I was working a full time and the job that we fell out about would’ve been a second job . I also have clinical depression and anxiety that was diagnosed by a psychologist. 
I felt triggered because there have been times in the past where people have told me to be completely honest with them and I was and I’ve been stabbed in the back in the exact same ways. She also lied to me while I was living at her house about her husband intentionally not paying on his car so it could get repossessed because they couldn’t afford the payments. They used my car for free (they did occasionally give gas money) while he had a suspended license and I never found out until the cops came to the house regarding the issue. But I never got an apology for that. It’s also triggering because I come from A narcissistic family and have always been made to feel guilty in almost every bad situation that I’ve had with my older family members (that whole “Your mother/grandmother Will always be right and deserving of respect because they’re older than you ,even if they disrespected you”). It’s also hard because I couldn’t speak up for myself while I was living at her house and I don’t wanna go off on my cousin because she seems like the type of person who would bring up every private thing that I’ve ever told her to family members.
At the time that all this was going on, I was living with her for 5 months in a city 12 hours away from my narcissistic mother, both of my grandfathers passed within a week of each other a week before this, and I found out that my father had stage III cancer. I’m waiting until things open up to see a therapist ,but for now I’m trying to meditate and eat right and do everything positive to keep my mind off of the situation. Everyday I think about what happened to me and I’m just tired of it and I want to let go. I know and understand why the situation was extremely triggering to me and I’m trying to work on those things ,but I still cannot get over it. Even if I’m with my friends or out doing something and have a good day it still comes across my mind. My cousin already ran her mouth to my family pretty much saying that she “doesn’t know why I never contact her anymore” and lied saying that I ignored her calls and text even though she hasn’t reached out to me.

159,"My girlfriend and I can't find out anywhere what's wrong with her. I woke her up last night after she had slept for about thirty minutes, but when she woke up she said she couldn't feel anything or move at all. 

She can move her body now, but she says she still can't feel anything. She can feel it if I poke her or grab her, but she can't feel anything she does to herself. 
We went to the ER and they said she just woke up badly or something, but I wake her up like that all the time. 

We went home, and she finally fell back asleep for the night, but she's awake again and still feels exactly the same. She says she can't describe what's happening to her and neither of us can figure out what to do. Is it dissociation or something like that? It's been going on for about 10 hours now.

160,"A little background info.
I have suffered with anxiety and depression in the past, I used to take medication for this in my early teens but stopped after going off to university, I figured this was mainly due to my age/lifestyle pre-university.

So, yesterday I got a sudden burst of sadness that I haven’t been able to shake off? 

I (22 Male) have been single now for a little over a year (roughly when I fully broke off my first real relationship).

The relationshup was a little messy and confusing towards the end/after breaking up, not really knowing what I wanted whether that be for us to stay friends, etc.

I Ended up going travelling and deleting her off everything for the last time after a few times of deleting/re-adding each-other - I decided this was the best move as it made me uncomfortable even seeing her, out of sight out of mind right?

This worked for me over time, like for the last 6 months, I’ve hardly thought about her/the situation and have been feeling great and really happy with my life.

So anyway, fast forward to the last couple of days, almost a year on, I’m in the best place I’ve probably ever been mentally, I have a decent graduate job, my own place (not living with my parents), a good income, I’m working out frequently and eating healthily, becoming more fit, pretty much achieving everything I wanted for myself after university.

The only two factors which have changed recently is that:

- I’ve started seeing somebody new, who actually seems like a good fit for me, I’ve been with other girls since my first relationship but nothing came from them or I didn’t see anything coming from them atleast just a fling if anything/casual sex.

- I’ve had to cancel all of my plans for travelling, I think subconsciously I had these to look forward to, and even though I didn’t think I was that bothered, maybe I am and that’s knocked me as there’s nothing to ‘look forwards to’

Any suggestions as to where/why this has suddenly made me feel really sad? It’s only really been since yesterday so could go away tomorrow. Any ideas?",13Jun2020,1

I searched for things that could be related to these issues i have, and suddenly I found out about Agitated Depression. It hit me as soon as i read about it. The psychomotor agitation, i always clink or grind my teeth together, shake my foot, walk around aimlessly, shimmy in my chair, turn over a lot at night. The irritability; angry outbursts which i immediately feel regret for, as if i didn't want it to happen but my body did it. The phychic agitation, it's basically impossible for my brain to shut off, i have racing thoughts a lot, and i experience frequent and severe insomnia.

171,"I’m about to be a junior in high school and this entire quarantine situation has eviscerated my mental health. I used to be happy everyday when I woke up for school, I would see a bunch of people I love, random acquaintances, good friends, hang out with people after school and would just have a good time in general. Not seeing people and having daily normal interaction has destroyed this. I’m stuck at home everyday with my mother and younger brother who are amazing people but I think I make them uncomfortable as of late with how socially inept I have become which only leads to more insecurities and anxieties towards being around them which only serves to make things worse. 

i attended a normal elementary school up until the end of second grade when it was shut down along with a bunch of other schools. Instead of just sending me to the local public school, my mom opted for a private school that was also nearby. This school was filled with people that have been friends since pre-k and have only know eachother in a school setting. i have obviously had incredible trouble fitting since I didn’t have the advantage of knowing them for years, practicing the same religion as them, (or any religion at all for that matter) and being an already pretty nervous and anxiety riddled kid who had trouble opening up to people since my father had overdosed and died the summer leading up to the third grade. This had lead me to sort of become “the man of the house” taking care of my brother, cleaning and just doing chores all around the house inside and out. I think this lead to me maturing or at least acting more mature than my age which created a rift between me and most people my age. I never hung out with a single one of them outside of school and i maybe had one or two good friends in this private school but like I said, they didn’t invite me to parties or hangouts or anything like that. On top of this I was borderline bullied by the teachers for not practicing christianity, or knowing anything about it, having trouble paying attention (I have ADD) and was once threatened with expulsion and told “I don’t belong here” by teachers, for doing the sign of the cross with my left hand on accident. By fifth grade I ceased to care what any of these people thought of me and would just do anything I could to piss off teachers in order to find some sort of connection with other students who found me funny. I would throw their limited supply of chalkboard erasers out the window as they told me not to do it, make absurdly loud noises in class, unplug all the mice in the computer lab before class started, and pretty much anything to disrupt class and distract everyone and bring the attention toward me. I believe I did this at the time because it was around when my brother was growing up which required more attention from my mother who was already giving most of the attention to him and without a second parent left me to sit alone in my room and play video games. At the beginning of fifth grade I met a group of guys at a gymnastics place I went to every week who wanted to play playstation together and were excited for an upcoming game called Destiny. We all shared our information and became very good friends over playstation, playing and talking essentially every single day together. However, this group of guys lived quite a ways away from me and made it really hard to hang out because of parents not wanting to drive that far and not wanting to do it often. I ended up hanging out with them once in the time span of fifth to eighth grade. 

In seventh grade I had finally found a small group I liked at school and pretty much only hung out with them inside school and continued to mostly be alone outside of school aside from my best friend Owen who I met in pre-k and we became best friends almost immediately, however due to living in different locations of the city we never attended the same school again. We hung out outside of school whenever we could since we both had hard home and family lives. Anyway in my fourth month of seventh grade I made a school shooting joke and was expelled pretty much immediately. I lost my small group of friends from there and not a single person attempted to stay in touch with me. I was moved to my grandparents house for the rest of the school year where I did cyber school on a shitty macbook every single day. My short attention span and already lack of real motivation or care in school because of the teachers I had experienced at catholic school led me to simply cheat and copy and paste everything basically that entire year. So I learned next to nothing for that entire school year. In eighth grade my only option for school, which was a previously a high school, was SV. 

SV was a new school that was just opening that year to middle schoolers since the building was previously a high school and was opened because of all of the other schools closing around the area. This brought in huge groups of people who already knew eachother before moving to SV. SV was also not on the best side of town and was probably one of the worst public schools in my area you could go to at the time. So i was once again reset in a new school with hundreds of kids i had never met before. I made friends with a few people in my class and in specials but that wasn’t until late in the year. At the beginning I could barely speak. Seeing no one for 9 months had brought out social anxiety in me and it was bad. I could barely muster a “sorry” when I knocked someone’s papers off their desks. Some of these people were incredibly nice to me though and made me feel more welcome. My closest friends I met their were on the bus ride home where people fought frequently, smashed actual glass bottles, whipped food around for fun, and just did whatever they want. I looked forward to the bus ride home everyday, it was my favorite part. I could disregard whatever the bus driver said and do whatever I wanted with my three friends who would just cause chaos on the bus. It started out very hard but by the end I had a pretty good eighth grade and passed with straight Bs and As. And then I had to reset again. 

I enrolled in a particularly difficult high school to get into that I’ll call CA. I lost all my friends once again, save for a few that made it into CA, but I was once again starting at a new school, alone, without friends. But these people are wonderful, they welcomed me and gave me a place almost instantaneously. It felt great, I made friends fast, both freshmen and sophomores, got a girlfriend, who i regret dating now, and was passing all my classes relatively easily with no hiccups academically. That summer was great, I hung out with my playstation friends much more often now and even with a few people from school. It was amazing. I went to camp one week out of that summer where I had the best week of my entire life and met a group of people that changed my entire outlook on life. As soon as I got back from camp I broke up with my girlfriend and things only got better. In sophomore year i met so many new people in all grades and made friends with everyone. At the sophomore dance I met a girl, we started dating and she has been amazing and has helped keep me happy up to this point. 

When the quarantine started, things went on as usual and i hung out with my friends pretty frequently like nothing has changed but after about a week their parents would not allow them to leave the house. At this point in school i hung out with no one from my grade outside of school. My closest friends have and will probably always be older than me. So my oldest and closest friends have I think forgotten about me at this point. They haven’t asked me to hang out in months now and don’t reach out. I have tried to reach out but they ignore me or just apologize without changing anything leaving me afraid to talk to them again because I don’t want to seem annoying. My social anxiety has also returned at this point, having been alone for so long, leaving it very difficult to talk to anyone or leave the house. I’m now stuck with my oldest friends ignoring me, being afraid to hang out with my newer friends because of my social anxiety and just not knowing them that well, and everyone of my friends who is the same age as me also not contacting me in months, and I have tried to reach out to them as well. My girlfriend is the only person I feel I have left. I feel completely and utterly alone. Afraid to speak to anyone and unable to see my friends. I’m gonna try to get a job soon and hopefully that brings some normalcy back to my life but I have a feeling I will be spending most of this summer by myself. 

Sorry about length but I just wanted to know if anyone out there had anything to say to offer as help or advice. Thank you",13Jun2020,2
172,"Hello!


I'm a 23 year old autistic women, and unfortunately there is incredible little on autism in women on the internet. 

After 10 years of running around and getting misdiagnosed, I only got diagnosed last year by sheer dumb luck, because my little brother's 16-year old friend asked if I'm on the spectrum and I started to look into it. 

As it later turned out, he was right. Still not sure why, because unlike the countless therapists I've met up with, he did not study psychology or anything remotely similar...


Either way, could we perhaps gather tips, tricks advice and help on this post in the comments?

I felt horrible kept doing it. Then when I tried to stop it was to late. Porn got in the mix. Now orgasms feel like nothing. I fap avg about 4 times a week. Sometimes more. Been good at removing the porn part but damage already done. I now have sick sexual thoughts. And random sick thoughts intruding on me and ruining my day or nice conversation because of this “addiction” I feel like a horrible person.

181,"
I used to be described as one of the most chill people. Someone who never cared and was cool with anything and never bothered. I'm an introvert and hate talking to people that aren't my close friend group. My whole life has been insecurities and constant anxiety. I didn't even know I had anxiety problems until I learned more about it just over a year ago and I just rethought what I knew about life and myself. While very very young, I had anxiety issues with using the toilet and this went much later that it should have into my childhood. This led to problems in school with anxiety and constantly thinking what everyone is thinking about me. I have memories from kindergarten and even headstart of fears of what kids thought of me. I was told by a kid I stunk once and it's burned into my memory. So growing up, I didn't know I had problems. I thought the crazy thoughts and worries constantly going through my head were 100% normal, although I didn't think about others experiencing this, never was a thought. I hardcore kept to myself, my perspective on life seems unique when I think of it now that I know Im not ""normal."" Also my whole life, I was asscheeks at socializing. I hated every second of it. I would do everything to avoid talking to even close family outside of my house, I never wanted to go to family events or birthday parties, and hated when my birthday was around because family would come. I was just labeled as shy and that's all I knew about myself with not liking social situations. 
 
Over a year ago, I started feeling ""off."" I didn't know what I really meant and I still don't know how to describe it. I wrote it down somewhere and it even has a date and more written, but doesn't matter. Then I started helping this girl out with her breakup with my bestfriend. It was messy and she was fucked up from a long list of toxic people already. I was apparently the only person to even care about her at all. I was quickly considered her best friend although I barely liked her even as a friend. I hung out occasionally just because I didn't want to be rude and turn it down, but I never enjoyed being around her because of hating social shit. I was always open to text her and talk though, and I even enjoyed it. I started helping her more and more and just being there. I eventually learned she had a huge crush on me and I didn't like that at the time. Over some months I started getting feelings for her too now. I really enjoyed helping her and it just started making us closer and closer. I started having more mental health issues and it's fuzzy and hard to remember why, but we tried to help each other. We we're full on in love and had a secret relationship (my anxiety issues). She wasn't well at helping me, and often hurt me in her attempts at helping. Any time I tried to talk about myself getting hurt from her, an argument would pursue. All she knew from her previous relationships were arguing and the way I talked seems like an attack in her head. (Oh and she's bipolar, and it's getting muuuch better with time, especially present day). It became more and more common. She just wouldn't understand or listen and always argued. I would be crying my eyes out texting her, begging her that I just want to help us, I'm just trying to help and be healthy. Nothing ever worked. She would begin to recognize it sometimes and after the argument/breakdown thing she would apologize and listen a little more. More problems always come. Things like now that my pains and traumas are stressing her out and making her break down more. Which is 100% true but she wouldn't understand that my traumas are coming from her original toxic behavior. I always made sure to mention that it's also my past as well and my issues, I never left that out. There's so much I can't type in that's so important to fully understand the context and perspective, like all the individual things that have caused problems and the ways we address them. I can't put into perspective how we both are just trying, both are hurt from one another, how I feel it's genuine love despite all the toxic shit. I don't think I'm in a manipulative kind of trap. I've ignored so many red flags from pre-relationship to throughout it, I always want to help them. I never wanted to give up and I gave the relationship everything I had in me. Now the relationship is almost 1 year. (Oh shit I forgot to mention that's the official relationship, the secret lasted a few months maybe, so really we have been together for much over a year.) For a few months now I've been drained, I barely feel like I care anymore. Shes mostly aware of how I feel. I don't trust her anymore and I'm so lost. She always did things I couldn't trust, things that were red flags. The first major trust issue was when she went behind my back and told my mom about my issues and. This isn't a very big deal but I am absolutely not okay with it. She was very aware that she and only she was trusted with my secrets. Now more recently, maybe a month or so ago, she went behind my back and read my notes on my phone. She also knew this wouldn't be okay. My notes is a place I go to cope. I write down my thoughts, especially the things I can't share with my girlfriend. Which is why she went in. I could go on for a very long time on my situation but I'm going to stop soon unless asked. A little more that's important: I'm very suicidal now, you can see the progression in my notes, from when I was just thinking of it but didn't want to, to how I am now. I have constant breakdowns and panic attacks. Almost all of them originate to direct things my girlfriend does, or from the traumas of the past things with her. I have so many more toxic traits now and I hate it. I hate life and I want to give up so bad. I'm in pain every day and I just don't know what to do, the feelings and thoughts constantly going on are so overwhelming. I've been wanting to just explain or talk somewhere so this is what I'm doing, I can't trust my notes anymore. I don't understand every issue going on in my head. I don't understand my thoughts. I've never been diagnosed with any mental health issues and I've never talked to any sort of professional in my life. I'm falling apart and I'm scared. I know there isn't much hope for me. I won't accept help. I've been more and more likely to refuse help over time and the only help I was okay with to begin with was from my girlfriend. Ive been alive many months longer than I thought I would be by now, I've lost count of the amount of times I decided I was going to finally do it, and it's almost always a result of a breakdown. It gets to the point of needing to kill myself to escape the pain that's much worse during a breakdown. It's getting exhausting being stuck in this pain and waiting for the end. I feel like a big attention whore so ignore me and that's okay",13Jun2020,1

183,"Most people seem to say that time heals all, and I understand the concept, it definitely has truth to it. But in the mean time as I wait for things to hopefully get better, does anyone have anything that usually helps the hard times become a little more bearable? 

Lately my life hasn’t been the best, and I’m in position where I can’t get help due to financial issues, and I don’t want to bother the people within my family because I feel like a burden, and in all honesty a little embarrassed about asking for help, and I’m not sure why. There is also already an extensive history of mental illness in our family, so I feel as if I’m just adding to my family’s issues If I say I’m feeling down or not necessarily “here”. 

I’ve just kind of not been connected to my own existence it feels like, and usually I can be positive, but I’m losing myself relatively quickly, and I just lost one of the only people I feel close with and its pushing me over the edge.

So for a few weeks my mom has been telling me to look up reviews on good juicers and what to buy. I didn't really find much and she bought one today anyway. So we fired it up and we all fell stupidly victim to the marketing material with oranges being pressed through with skin. Then we tasted it and then it hit us, that you're not supposed to do that. I am supposed to be the ""intelligent"" one, who does think beforehand. But I didn't. Only *after the fact*, and this is a recurring theme, did I look up in the manual and the internet that it's not recommended. And that a juicer is actually not really simplifying we/I couldn't think of either. Never thought before beforehand ""hmm, let's google actually if you can do that with oranges"". And now we're 150 bucks lighter and don't know if we can return it.

So the problem is: I don't think beforehand on many things, only *after the fact* I really do. It happens so much with stuff I buy online, I try to do my best effort to research things thoroughly beforehand but for some reason my head only really starts working after I did the big action, be it buying something or other big decisions (and I struggle with those enough already, and then also regretting them because I properly consider things *after the fact*). I only ever think afterwards, my head doesn't allow me to think before. This resulted in many bad purchases over the span of several years. I clearly didn't improve, i didn't learn from my mistakes, i keep doing them over and over again. I feel like I'm literally the Greek mythology figure Epimetheus at times, the ""afterthinker"", who doesn't think before but like me afterwards.
And to think that I'm gonna attempt engineering this fall, where you're supposed to use your head smart and common sense. Laughable, really.

186,"Trying to help a loved one located in Hawaii who does not want help.  He appears to be in a manic state but no past diagnosis.  About a week ago he started acting very strange and not like himself.  We reached out to his close friends and they all said they were going to call us as they noticed the same.  I was going to fly from east coast USA but then realized the travel ban would tie my hands from being able to provide help, leave his house etc.  His friends were able to get him into an ambulance and to the hospital where nothing was identified medically.  An eval was performed over something like face time with a mental health professional on the mainland and they were ok with releasing him.  He was agitated with us but still communicating.  

Everything has escalated now where he verbally abused his sister on the phone so we let him know that we loved him and would communicate with him again after he contacted a local mental health expert that we both know he has refused and now is really escalated by contacting our kids and via voice mail and texts saying very vindictive and nasty things that he would never have said in the past.  

We have the non-local police number for emergency that is local to him.

I'm just wondering if anyone can relate or give advice on the vicious circle I have been in for years.

In the morning I take diazepam for anxiety (I know I know everything... I'm trying to get off it for a long time), then it makes me sleepy and I drink coffee to wake up but then I get anxious and because I don't want to take diazepam I drink alcohol. Then because I've been drinking on an empty stomach and I'm tipsy I eat a lot of crappy food until I'm sick to my stomach. I then feel bad phisicallh and mentally and I throw up because I'm a fat idiot. Go to sleep and do it all over again. Like what the fuck is wrong with me? I mean I know what's wrong with me and I know that anxiety is one of my worse problems and this is how I deal with it and I know it's very unhealthy. I just have to say, when I eat properly and do exercise and meditation, it's better for my anxiety, but I have to say - I get BORED with that. 
I know it's kind of a privilege to be bored with being healthy, but that's kind of a curse as well. It's like I want to get myself into trouble by behaving badly towards myself. But why? It's not like I don't have any interests, I can do things and make things and do my hobbies... It's just a lot more fun when I'm either anxious from coffee (I know, I just said being anxious is fun! Whaaat? But it's not fun when it's in a public space, just at home and when it's not a full blown panic attack) or tipsyf from the alcohol. Everything in between is just trying to get there. 
What is my problem? How do I stop being... me?",13Jun2020,1
190,"I would say I’ve ‘wanted to die’ for about 3 years now and although I feel bad for saying ‘wanting to die’ because I know that I’ll probably never do it I still just don’t want to be here, maybe just disappear for a very long time or into a different life for a while. But anyway, I’ve always thought that the reason I haven’t actually committed suicide is probably because I’m too scared, I’m too scared and obviously there is a part of me that doesn’t want to die which sometimes strives right through me and shines a lot stronger than these thoughts for a little while every so often, and most likely the fact that maybe a permanent disappearance just completely out of existence just isn’t what I want at all but just a temporary one to which I’d return when I felt happier. However I’ve been doing a lot of thinking and I think another main reason why I haven’t killed myself is because of how much I overthink everything, it doesn’t matter what it is it could be from a tiny joke, a bit of sarcasm which I take just fine but it does stick in my head for days and days after or to how every action that I do or don’t make will have as a consequence on me. Writing this I do feel like although overthinking does hold me back in so many ways and allows me to exclude myself from opportunities for myself I think this is the one situation where I can be grateful because it gives me so many reasons why I shouldn’t kill myself. 

I don’t even know what the reason for this was I just wanted to share 100% truth with atleast something. 

I’m really trying my hardest to believe that there is a point in life and that there is gonna be better time’s but sometimes I’m just so overwhelmed and I take that out in myself because I self harm and have for a long time, the amounts of times I’ve tried to stop is just unbelievable but it is what it is, today is the day where I truly believe I will never self half again because I want to pick myself up and if you get the chance to read this I want you to pick yourself up and know that there will be better time’s and we will get to experience them. 

At the minute life really isn’t great and I feel like I’ve given up on it and the people around me and I don’t think I will start caring about them again any time soon, but I’m still gonna be hopeful and try and give it time. 

I have an overwhelming desire to be loved by someone so I can give all of my love and affection to them and make them feel the bestest and happiest they ever have with anyone, I want to feel needed. 

I’m not even going to re read this post but just post it anyway it’s such a rollercoaster of negative and lil bit of positive lol but that’s alright.",13Jun2020,1
191,"So, this is kind of a long story short situation, but here goes:

I live with the person I've been in love with for 5 years. Early on, we had a physical relationship, but that was spelt out as being as far as things between us would progress, despite developing a severe co-dependent bond at the same time and at one point actually asking me out in a way that came across as accusing me of catching feelings. Eventually the sex died down, and they entered into an actual relationship. I did everything I could to like and accept their new partner, but my world came crashing down as the realization that I was hopelessly in love with them hit me. For two years I watched as their partner cheated, abused their trust, and failed them at every turn. During their fights, the comment was even thrown around, ""I should have just dated TypicalVariety0!""

Now they've broken up, and the love of my life, who suffers from bipolar and BPD, has had their heart broken. I know what the symptoms of their disease are, and have already made clear I am willing to endure it to be there for them. They feel no distinct attachment to their ex, nor any other person, and wants nothing to do with the way we used to live. They are well aware of my feelings, with it even having led to fights regularly between us. At the same time, they also regularly flaunt their naked body at me and flirt. During and after all of these experiences, I'm left with the horrible knowledge that I will never be enough for them. I already struggle with severe untreated ADD, depression, and suicidal tendencies, and over the past 6 months it has increased 10-fold, with 4 suicide attempts and countless breakdowns and panic attacks. Many days I can't even leave my bed, because at least then it won't get worse. I've begun ignoring my family and friends, and coupled with Covid restrictions this has become almost 100% isolation.

Things got even worse after I made the horribly toxic decision to look in their messaging app and saw texts between them and the now ex, trashing me and talking about sending me videos of them fucking just to cause me pain, because I ""deserve that"" for having feelings for them. I was emotionally numbed. I knew my feelings were inappropriate, but I honestly have been trying to work through them as much as possible. This felt like a final straw, so I began packing all of my belongings to move back with my parents. I tried to leave, and they broke down, begging me to stay, claiming it was all because they were trying get laid and that they saw how horrible it was, regardless of my shady way of finding out.

Now it's been almost a week, and next to nothing has changed. We've talked about it twice, and I've made clear how difficult our situation is for me. Other than that, our main topic has been ALL OF THE OTHER PEOPLE CHASING AFTER THEM AND HOW BADLY THEY WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH THOSE PEOPLE. They keep getting mad about my moodiness too, especially because it usually comes about after those discussions. They realize one of the main reasons I'm depressed is because I want them so badly, and they get angry at how guilty they feel seeing me fall apart, while also unwavering on the decision that they don't want to be with me. They claim to literally need me in their life and even say they can't picture coming home to a house without me in it, but that bears no weight on the decision.

I'm fuckin dyin here. I want to take care of them and don't want to go anywhere. I don't want to manipulate them into a relationship. I recognize the only way I'll ever really get past all this is distance and extensive therapy. I want to be with them, but I know that I probably never will be.

I don't know what advice I'm really looking for here, maybe I just felt like venting. Idk. It's a fresh nightmare daily, but they are also the most beautiful thing in the world to me.

Tl;Dr: I'm hopelessly in love with my best friend. We're both unwell. I'm either being toxic or being told I'm toxic daily. Tried to leave and they stopped me. Been a week and IDK what to do.

I will purge minimum 4 times a day and always have laxatives on hand for when I think I haven’t done I a good enough job. I will make myself sick anywhere as I have just got so desensitised to it. Family’s, friends house, restaurants, cinema and shopping centre.

197,"I feel like I always live in my head, I find it hard to focus on the outer world. I do often day dream constantly, I could be walking down a hallway and not really be aware of it fully but just lost in my head. I find school work in general much harder than others and when it comes to life I'm pretty lazy, when left to my own devices I'll probably get to sleep at 3 in the morning, everything get's messy etc. and I find it hard to stop; sometimes I sit down to work and I'm just in a blur, that's what it feels like and is a good way of putting it, I'm constantly in a blur.

I know there's something different about me compared to other individuals, when it comes to academia it's always the case that it's everyone else and then there is me. I'm always the one that didn't get the message it's non-uniform day in a week, it's always me that forgot to hand in homework etc. It could literally be 200 other students that got it and I didn't, it's very clear I am different in a way from everyone else but find it hard to describe. I thought it may be just that I have a low IQ or something. Also, my dad is the exact same as me; whatever that element is of us.

I'm not hyperactive and it used to be called ADD what I'm talking about and after looking up symptoms it actually describes me perfectly for the most part. It's like if attention was a scale, my natural place on it would be much more adverse compared to the average person, there is another person like me in my school who is like this. We're both sort of labelled as ""retarded"" by our friends, not literally but in a joking way.

There is something different to me, it isn't a manifestation or just a habit I've got. It's something that has always been the case for as long as I can remember, and now it's come to post secondary education whatever it is has just become much more of a juxtaposition between me and everyone else.

198,"Howdy to all y’all.  Been a lurker for a month or so now but I felt I was about out of resources so I figured I’d turn to y’all.  

“Burner account for obvious reasons” blah blah blah... “Sorry I’m on mobile” yea ok get on with it.  “Apologies in advance, it may get lengthy” seriously dude shut up and speak...

TL/DR at the bottom 

Man... where to begin... So, I recently married the love of my life (actually had a crush on her when we were in middle/high school age but she ghosted me... oh how the turn tables).  After high school we both took different educational paths but reconnected back in 2017.  We’ve been together for a total of about 2.5-3.5 years now and for the majority of our time together it’s been fantastic.  That being said, however, she has been upfront and honest about her struggles with depression and anxiety (mental health woes that she has since “came out of” or experiences them to a much lesser degree) as well as a diagnosis of OCPD.  When she told me about her diagnosis I really didn’t know what that meant and, for the most part, it didn’t really have a significant effect on our relationship.  Or so I thought at that time. 

So, now that we’re married, we’ve been having  issues regarding communication.  She’s always been a touch on the controlling side but I just chalked that up to stereotypical female behavior in the relationship (I mean this somewhat jokingly), but I’ve noticed that it’s begun to kind of... ramp up recently.   Roughly two months ago I began seeking therapy related to my own dealings with anxiety and depression and, one thing the therapist pointed out early on was how the issues that I initially presented really weren’t so much my issues (though I’m still responsible for the action nonetheless), but more so it was her who had the issue with my behavior.  I sought counsel from a few close friends (friends that I knew would be unbiased and objective) who were somewhat privy to the situation and they all came to the same consensus; that she was the one that had the issue regarding my actions.  This isn’t to vindicate me from any wrongdoing, however; it definitely wasn’t my best moment(s).  
*if more detail is needed here I’ll be more than happy to respond in the comments* 

If I’m being honest, I always remembered her diagnosis, but it was something that I thought had been treated and resolved... this no longer seems to be the case.  Anytime I don’t follow through with something she asks me to do, be it I took too long to start/finish the task or didn’t do it the way she wanted me to, she gets upset with me and tells me she’s tired of me not listening and how this is an “every day thing.”  The problem, though, is that any time I say, “okay, let’s talk about it and discuss how we both contributed to the argument and how we need to just work on our communication/how we understand each other’s words, this statement is usually met with, “i don’t want to talk about it... I just wish you didn’t question/respond-to every thing I tell you to do... etc”.  The most concerning thing she’s said recently is, “I just wish you would do what I want and just say yes...”. Usually, I just drop it rather than pressing further.

To be fair, she’s recently been under *immense* stress at work as well as experienced many other, I’d be pressed to say, mild to moderate traumatic experiences, so counseling would be beneficial to help her process through some of the events, but now I’m feeling she needs to seek therapy, not just for that, but also for her OCPD.  I’ve mentioned it once or twice, about how she should probably reach out to someone (not necessarily a counselor but at least a confidant) but this was met with a “no, I don’t see why I need to, I’m fine,” and I haven’t even mentioned anything about therapy/treatment for her disorder, just for help processing recent life changes. 

As I progress through my own counseling, and even before I started really, I had a feeling that couples counseling might be beneficial for the two of us.  Bringing this proposition up also seemed to irritate her because, as I feel I’ve laid out previously, it seems from her perspective all the issues rest with me and *I’m* the one who needs help.  

I don’t really know what I’m posting for; maybe to vent, see if I’m the only one dealing with this, glean any advice, etc.  I don’t really know, but if y’all have any advice, comfort, wise words, or other recommendations please feel free to comment or message.  

TL/DR: Recently married to a wife who’s diagnosed with OCPD and the symptoms seem to be worsening.  I wish for her to peruse therapy, whether couples or solo, to help her because I’m struggling to stay afloat in what seems like a one-sided relationship.",13Jun2020,2

So basically last night and today I ran shifts at my job and both shifts were AWFUL. Then at the end of this one more shit hit the fan and I could feel tears coming on and frustration but I was able to hold it back and told myself, ""Just wait until you get to your car then you can cry.""

But then something else happened and then as I was getting all my shit together to put away I went into a room where my boyfriend was (he also is a shift lead) and I saw that he was basically told to run the night shift differently than how we normally do by our boss. And it basically felt like an insult to me and the fact that last night went awfully and my boss witnessed it. Then just like that I kind of like shut down stood up, and the tears came right away and I couldn't stop them so I ran to the bathroom to calm down.

When I did that I went back and my boyfriend knew something was wrong because he saw my face turn red and then could see that my eyes were red when I came back to finish what I had started. He told me to close the door, and I did and then he reassured me that the changes had nothing to do with me and was more about accountability and tracking stuff.

But for some reason the more he talked the more I felt suffocated, and I abruptly stopped him and said I was going to head out and bye. I quickly rushed out and when I got into my car, I realized I couldn't breathe and I was crying and breathing rapidly and basically panicking. I know panic &amp; anxiety attacks are usually pretty severe but I wasn't sure if it was just me crying and freaking out or if it was something more.

Edit: Basically everything from last night and this morning all hit at once, I felt awful like it was all my fault and that despite me working my ass off to help my shifts out it never goes well. And NOW management is changing things after my shift-when others who don't help on their shifts always seem to get easy and good shifts that end on time. I'm basically super upset with myself and feel worthless, and having all of that hit me at once was too much. ",13Jun2020,5

My best friend is really pretty (hourglass figure, little nose, symmetrical face) whereas I’m tall, skinny, big nose &amp; no boobs or ass which I’m currently working on. So as you can tell, she gets a lot of male attention, I’m pretty much the designated ugly friend lmfao. I don’t blame her because she’s a lovely person and we’ve been friends for years and she’s the best friend i’ve ever had, it just really sucks that i’m constantly comparing myself to her all the time.

214,"I’m 22, younger brother is 18. He met this girl about a year ago. Prior to this, he had always been a really quiet kid at school. Didn’t have too many friends, was into anime and had full sized anime pillows and stuff as well as posters on his wall so that didn’t exactly do wonders for his social life to put it bluntly... 

He had a few self esteem issues relating to loneliness and people not wanting to be friends with him, but it was never too bad, he then met this girl last year and everything went downhill at 100mph. She is on 200mg of antidepressants (which I understand for a 17 year old is a substantial dose) and has previously attempted suicide. Before he met her, he was lonely and struggled with confidence but he had never suffered like this with mental health. 

Since getting into a relationship with her, he has completely isolated himself from the very, very few friends he had, and us as a family. He started self harming when they were first ‘talking’ etc, but stopped as soon as they got together and seemed really happy about life. 

Our family isn’t keen on the girlfriend as he spends ALL of his time up at his house. My mum asked him to spend Christmas Day with us, or at least the meal, and he said it would be a waste of his time when he could be spending it with her. So it’s safe to say my mum is really not a fan of her. He has an unhealthy obsession with her. 

They broke up at the start of COVID-19 and he began self harming regularly again. But now he’s threatening to kill himself. He finished work today and his now ex girlfriend messaged my mum (quite alarming initially considering they hate each other) saying she was concerned for my brother and believed he is hiding another pair of scissors in the house and he is also threatening to kill himself. I went in his room, found the scissors in a draw as well as a serious of really grotesque handwritten love-letters, things like suicide pacts with her. He is genuinely obsessed with her

After he finished work today he didn’t come home and we were quite worried. Mum called the police - turns out my brother had actually called the police himself asking for help and threatening to harm himself. 

So the police have now detained him under the mental health act and he is being looked after at a mental health unit nearby, although the police officer said the reality is he will probably be released in the morning if they think it’s safe enough. 

If he is back in the morning - I don’t know how to act. We don’t want to smother him as it will just stress him unnecessarily, but we are also really, really concerned about leaving him alone because we worry he may harm himself. Also - we don’t know what to do on the girlfriend front. She doesn’t want anything to do with him, but I imagine she feels pretty trapped and pressured to keep in contact else he will hurt himself. Similarly, she herself is the worst possible influence for him. He didn’t start self harming until he met her. He didn’t talk about suicide until he met her. Part of me thinks this started as something he thinks will make him seem relatable to her, but he’s now gotten too far into it that he believes it all himself. He did have preexisting self esteem issues, but he never had mental health issues like this. So we don’t really want him to have any contact with her as she seems like a toxic example/influence, but I worry that if we try to discourage him from seeing her in whatever ways possible then this will take away the only thing he’s clinging on to. 

Any advice at all would be really appreciated, I’m pretty ignorant when it comes to mental health issues so would really welcome some recommendations",13Jun2020,1

217,"For most of my life I haven't had many friends, but around when I started middle school I've been trying my best to open up to people. My social skills were unsurprisingly pretty crap, and around this time I switched schools. I had a really hard time fitting in and still feel like I quite don't. That all kind of got mixed in with my depression, suicidal thoughts, the huge workload at the new school ( bc it's a specialized program at an elite school), so it was pretty traumatizing to say the least. (this was around 7th-8th grade)

Thankfully it's a dark place I've pulled myself out of, but it's left me with a really bad fear of rejection and feeling of uncertainty when it comes to people. It happens with friends, family, classmates, even complete strangers on the street. When I don't constantly receive validation from a person, my mind tends to take on the idea that that person dislikes me.

I'm a pretty timid guy who has a hard time approaching people in large groups, so when the anxiety and fear of rejection kick in school can be very mentally draining. Thing is, most of classmates are really friendly towards me, I get compliments often, I've never experienced any direct bullying, I have a few friends. This has brought a lot of guilt, because I feel like such a terrible human being for thinking these things about people who objectively are very kind and considerate.

I've gotten better at identifying these delusions when they kick in, but I'm fearful that unthinkingly I might lash out at people and say something I'd regret later. It hasn't happened yet, if it gets worse, I'll start seeing my therapist again, but for now I'd like to know if you guys have any tips for how I could help myself un-learn this very toxic kind of thinking.

Thanks for taking your time, really appreciate it!",13Jun2020,1
219,"Hi all, I've had these strange symptoms since I was around 18 and wondered if anyone else has felt anything similar. I've been to psychiatrists and neurologists but nobody has uncovered a cause or given me a firm diagnosis.

I have episodes of this feeling of physical separation from my body. Specifically from my sense of touch. I can bring this on just by thinking about the feeling, so am certain it is psychological in origin. I start to notice it at my mouth first. My tongue and lips start to feel ""numb"", almost like pins and needles. This spreads to my whole body and I lose the ability to sense coordination, e.g. I couldn't tell you if my arm is raised or lowered without looking to check. It's much much harder to move effectively, once or twice I've had to pull over if I've been driving and once I even collapsed and couldn't hold a standing position. It's not ""pins and needles"" where I feel tingly but more like a feeling that my sense of touch is operating in stop motion or having oscillating delays. 
I also get tinnitus and visual snow at the same time so it feels like there is interference on all of my senses.

This feeling used to terrify me and I felt like i was ""fading out"" of existence or dying, so i used to think they were panic attacks. Now I'm used to the episodes, my mental state doesn't change throughout and I'm able to calmly explore what is happening without feelings of panic. It usually lasts for about 5 minutes but comes in clusters, so I can go months without an episode but then have 4 or 5 in the same day.

Side note - I also have diagnosis for Aspergers, ADHD and temporal lobe epilepsy (seizure free since I was around 9). I've had an EEG to check if the episodes are related to the epilepsy but it came back normal.

It could be related to my mild Aspergers, which I was diagnosed with when I was a kid but probably no longer meet the diagnostic criteria. It could be migraine aura, but I don't suffer migraines and that wouldn't explain why I can bring them on at will. Any ideas?",13Jun2020,1

221," I went up to visit my aunt and uncle to get a break from all the news and just spend quality family time but since I got hear my aunt and dad and uncle talk about nothing but the news and BLM.

 My cousin is fine, she is in 7th grade but I almost can't watch anything even pg13 sometimes because it may have the word shit in it. My cousin wanted to watch a horror movie for the first time last night and halfway through the middle of the movie she almost sent her upstairs because it was to inappropriate and I said that if she wants to stay and watch it she can because at some point she is gonna watch one without you knowing.

This came at the dismay of my dad and uncle. She won't even let me put on spongebob even though she is in 7th grade because it will teach her bad behaviors. Even if we manage to get to watch an R rated movie because my uncle says we can my aunt makes loud noises anytime the F word comes up because my cousin is down stairs but she has headphones one watching her iwn Tv shows.

Anytime I even try to like say anything in terms of advice on how to handle things or try to give my cousin a voice or a say in the matter my dad tries to silence me. And I am turning 18 in a few weeks and I'm treated like I wouldn't know anything better than my cousin in 7th grade. 

My cousin has major problems in school to the point where they are worried she wont be able to make it to freshman year if highschool amd struggles with addition and often shuts down when confronted a hard math problem and is very insecure and socially awkward. I try to give some advice as I used to be like that but they shelter her from everything. My dad defends them by using the same argument of shes an only child but just because she is doesn't justify sheltering her from any obstacle.

I want to see the best for my cousin. Im not saying I am a better parent hell im not evem saying I would be a good parent but it doesn't hurt to take advice. My uncle is fine and often has to keep my aunt in check some to with her protectivness. I love my aunt and she is a good parent but she shelters my cousin to much and it pisses me off whenever I am rejected for pointing it out and offering good alternatives of doing things.",13Jun2020,2
222,"Hi! I suffer from bipolar II disorder (which entails depression), anxiety, and ADHD. These have all been diagnosed by a professional when I was a teenager. But being the rebellious teen I was I stopped going to the doctor, and stopped taking my meds around the age of 17. (What a dummy I was). 

Around the age of 25 I started desperately wanting to see a psychologist, and psychiatrist again but I couldn't afford it because I was at that terrible income bracket where I didn't qualify for cheap insurance but I also made to little to even be able to afford even crappy insurance, let alone be able to afford to pay out-of-pocket.

Well my financial situation has very recently changed. And after a major mental breakdown last Tuesday I decided enough was enough, I'm tired of living like this and with the help of a friend I made a longterm and short term plan to take back control of my life. One of those things In my plan was, mental health help. So I picked up some pretty damn good insurance, and scheduled my first appointment in years to see a psychologist next month. 

However, this is where I need advice. How do I approach my new psychiatrist without looking like a drug seeker. I'll be honest I kinda look like a junkie (thanks terrible self hygiene from depression) even though I don't do drugs outside of occasionally drinking every other weekend, and smoking cigarettes daily. 

I worry because about 4-5 years ago I had an unexpected panic attack that got so bad I started thinking I was having a stroke, (I psyched myself out into showing physical symptoms) and went to thre hospital. After I was admitted and explained to the nurse I thought I was having a stroke the doctor who came into see me, looked at me and before even introducing himself or asking ne any questions, he told me straight out, that he's not giving me any drugs. He says he has junkies on the daily coming in to him looking for drugs. I was in shock. It was so unexpected, I was there because I thought I was having a fucking stroke, not drugs... It turns out it was just a panic attack inducing physical symptoms. 

Now the thing is.. I worry this could happen with my psychiatrist. Like I said I have been diagnosed with these things before and have been treated in the past. So I know what I need, I need a mood stabilizer, coinciding with an anti-depressant as not to induce a manic episode because of my bipolar disorder, ADHD medication such as an amphetamine, and anti-anxiety medication such as a sedative. 

Now.. I know doctors don't like it when patients tell them these things, I also know that doctors don't like patients that are knowledgeable on things like this either, because it can arouse suspicion that they are looking for something in particular to feed their drug habit. 

But I can't help it that I know these things. Ive researched these things heavily over the years because without being able to afford treatment I needed to learn and find ways to manage my disorders myself. Not to mention it just interest me, if I could I'd go to school for neurology, and psychology. These two topics have always interested me. 

But ofcourse the doctors don't know that, and I'm scared I could be profiled, and judged and classified prematurely as a drug seeker. 

So the other option is to play stupid, but I can't do that either because.. truthfully both my ego, AND morals won't allow that. 

Plus there's the problem that playing stupid will delay treatment because than the doctor will have to re-diagnose me which will take time, prolonging the time it will take me to get treatment for something which I already know I have. 

There's also the problem that I don't think I will be able to provide him with my previous medical records regarding my BPD because the neurologist who originally diagnosed me when I was 15 abruptly moved to another state many years ago to help with disaster relief from a natural disaster, and he never came back. And I don't know how to contact him. He will have access to my hospital records and the records from my pediatrician from when I was a kid to support my diagnosis. 

I honestly don't know if I'm just being paranoid about this whole thing. 

All I know is I desperately NEED treatment and this is the only psychiatrist in-network in my area for my insurance and I don't want to f*** this up.",13Jun2020,1

228,"I am seriously trying to decide whether or not to just delete my account here since it seems like no matter what I post nobody replies...or cares...and I understand TOTALLY about people being in their own headspaces and needing to focus on themselves. I do it too. Now I am being just totally honest, and I hope no one takes this the wrong way, but I seem to post nice things to people some of the time (some days I am more active than others, again, depending on how I feel that day) but then I post and I don't get any replies at all. Not even a ""well, I can't help but I heard you"" kind of reply. I would love to see THAT even. I know my problem is hard to understand and it seems like I might be bragging about it sometimes, but that is part of it...I know I have this burning desire in me (ugh sorry for that pun hahah) but I am also so passionate about it that I want to share how beautiful it is through my eyes...not realizing that it can be destructive and bad if it isn't handled carefully. I understand a lot of people don't know HOW to reply to something like this because it is so odd...Damn. I'm an odd duck for sure. Quack.  


I don't know. I just don't want to be here anymore if no one is going to listen. I don't feel supported. I don't feel loved...I just don't feel like I belong here.  


So, by either tonight (later) or tomorrow I will determine if I will stay here or just fuck off like some people seem to want me to do. It's fine. I am quite used to being alone and I am okay with that. In fact, I made a whole ""career"" out of being alone when I was in prison. I prefer just staying to myself rather than trying to reach out and being ignored, disrespected, and shit on.

So this may just be the end. There is a lot more to it, like a supposed ""friend"" who won't reply to my posts because the person doesn't want to ""get sucked into drama""...which I can understand sort of, but it is still a fucking shitty thing to say because I know if this person were hurting and posting, I wouldn't give a shit about the other morons who might post hurtful things to the person. I would defend the person no matter what. The only thing I can understand is that this person said it would not be good for (the person's) mental health right now...so that makes me unable to be upset with the person.  


Sorry if that was just hard to read, but I don't want to give away the details.  


Bye guys. I am leaning towards deletion, so I am saying my goodbyes now with real tears in my eyes. I can't take the hurt I feel when I come here now. See ya and please help yourselves by getting help and trying to be the best you that you can be.

But also, mainly since COVID hit the U.S., I haven’t had the motivation to do much of anything other than play Animal Crossing and watch YouTube. I don’t know if I’m just in a lazy slump, or if I just don’t have it in me to do things I really want to do. I made a few “art” projects for my boyfriend for Christmas, got through the school year alright, and worked on my physical health (a decent amount), all of which took effort on my part and are things I still want to do (minus the schoolwork). I just can’t really find the motivation or drive to do these things. Maybe it’s because I don’t have the people from my school—teachers, friends—to communicate with as easily, I’m not sure. It just feels a lot like everything has been *even harder* to do than usual lately.

I can’t focus until he messages me and even until then all i can think about is when he’ll be replying. By evening i was super unstable I confronted him for not replying, and topic turns to worse and we ended up talking about how i cant make him happy. i asked if it was about the distance, he said yes. i asked if he wanted me to go there, he said no. and then he said he is holding himself back, he proceeded to tell me this is getting too much and then went to sleep. I am so unstable because I always get overly attached to people who shows even the slightest kindness to me. I always base my happiness on those people and end up hurting myself when I get too much and they leave me. I am unstable because i dont think ill ever be worthy enough for them to choose me. i dont think ill ever be pretty enough for them to even consider me. if only i was prettier, maybe then he would have reconsidered. all those guys i attached myself into mightve reconsidered.
