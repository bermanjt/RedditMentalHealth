0,"I'm a 21 year old female living in the US, I'm currently gong to college but I'm really dealing with something right now and I can't tell what it is. 

I've been generally depressed and had anxiety for most of my life but I think that stuff is pretty livable for me. But over the past couple of years I've dealt with these random spurts of anger and lashing out. It usually happens with my significant others  or close friends. Usually things go really well and I think I'm a very nice and helpful friend/SO to them. But for some reason little things will set me off for no reason and everything they say or do will upset me even if it's just the littlest thing. For example, me and my friends play video games together online and if the game doesn't go well I'm usually fine and just laugh it off, but I will randomly just choose a time and completely freak out for no reason and overreact and escalate things. I even blocked 2 of my best friends for no reason just to make a statement, like it's a cry for attention and I'm aware of this I just don't know why I do it or how to stop it.

 Idk if this is even the right place to put this or if anyone can even help I just wanted to know if anyone knew anything about this. (Also sorry if this isn't a lot of information you can ask questions if you need/want to)",24Feb2020,1

Football was more than a sport for me, my counselor suggested I play football because I have a lot of anger. So I did and it helped but now it's all over. I feel like this is a new low, im moving to a alternative school that doesn't have a football program. I don't know what to do im devastated...",24Feb2020,1
2,"Hi, I just graduated in December as a electrical engineer. I feel as if I am not good enough and will never get a job. Now I can’t even go to job websites and apply. I get anxious when I am applying or looking for jobs or even when I am trying to up-skill to become a better candidate. I also wake up in the middle of the night at 3am everyday. I started taking antidepressants but it seems to me that they are making my condition worse.",24Feb2020,1

This time two years ago I was motivated, actively tried to better myself, found time for the important things/people and seized every opportunity I could. 

Fast forward to today. I don't know how to be happy anymore. I'm good at hiding the cracks but they're there and they're getting worse. I have someone I can talk to and do talk to regularly but it is very short term relief. 

I hate my place of work. I work in a creative role that my managers have erected a box around. There is no scope to be creative in a role that desperately needs it, my concepts and ideas are constantly thrown out and I get things thrown back at me when other companies are doing things better than we are. We can blow every company similar to us out of the water but I've been put in this little beige box and the key has been thrown away. 6 months ago I was taken out of the communal office and put on my own. I hate it, I'm isolated. I've been trying to get out for a year and my job rejection rate is a solid 100%. The worst part is I'm not missing out by much. No matter how much preparation work I do, I simply can not land a job

My second job brings me some joy but I can't live off it. It's an On-Call based job. I live the job, I love my colleagues, they are closer to a second family than colleagues. But the calls are few and far between. Being On-Call isolates me from doing anything more than 4 minutes from my house, booking off-call and missing a call makes me feel worse and I'm now stuck in a loop with nowhere to go.

I moved out this week. I had to move back in with my parents for a while and now I'm finally back out of their box room and in my own space. I though this would help, their house is crowded at the best of times, but it hasn't. All its achieved is cementing a constant reminder that I'm very much alone every time I walk through in door. I'd love a dog but it's against my contract. My friends have moved away or work odd shifts and don't normally make time for me unless I instigate it. They're busy with families and lives, I get forgotten about quite easily.

My last relationship was 4 years ago to someone who one day never spoke to me again and moved on. I've only had one serious relationship and that was as a teenager. I don't know how to meet people, I've been ghosted by all but one person who I've met on dating apps. After my first and only date I was told there was no connection and we ended it there amicably.im.actively looking but every time I get rejected I feel more and more like that person isn't out there. I just miss having that person to relax with, to be myself with.

I'm crap with money but I'm working on that. I've cut down my spending massively and focussed on building up my savings. It's going to take a while but I have a plan.

I am not sure why I've come here, wether it be to just get it all out anonymously or wether I'm looking for answers I'm not quite sure. Sleep seems to be the only relief from this never ending circle of crappiness. I just exist, I'm not a whole person anymore and I'm definately not me. I lost myself at some point over the last two years and I'm desperate to find myself again.",24Feb2020,1

Dear Reddit,

I am sick. No, I do not mean cancerous sick, or flu sick. I mean mentally sick. It's debatable whether or not I chose to be this way or not. Ironically, I am not making this for your sympathy. I believe for awareness, probably. I'm not entirely sure but I am tired of keeping this inside of me. I am fully prepared for any backlash I will receive. Maybe now, we'll see.

I am a liar. A pathological liar. I lie for sympathy. Sympathy from others. Not for money or things of the like. But because I want it. I want it deeply. Every choice I have made for the past five years of my life has been based on this craving of sympathy. I lie to my friends and to people I care about. Sometimes strangers, but I mostly do it around people I am close to. Not because I have to and that makes it worse.

If you asked me, I would tell you that I have depression. To be quite frank, I have never been fully sure if this is 100% true or not. Maybe to some extent. But that truth is, I *want* to be depressed so someone can ask me what's wrong and I can reply with the cliche ""I'm fine."" I want people to be worried about me.

If I take my medication, I want people to ask me why and then I can be embarrassed and say for ""personal reasons.""

If I cut myself, I want people to see the marks and tell me to stop.

I don't necessarily make it obvious or say ""here, look at me!"" but when I do it, I have a sick sense of wanting someone to see the marks.

I had an incident when I was younger that led to me almost being molested. And even though I knew that it had not gone that far, I recently told a friend that I had been. I almost felt satisfaction when I told him. Excitement.

I told the same friend that before I knew him, I had a suicide attempt by overdose. Not true.

I told another friend that when I was younger, I didn't eat for five days because I was anorexic. Not true.

When I get anxious, sometimes I play it up to make it seem like I get anxiety attacks regularly. Not true.

I am not fully sure what caused this. Maybe I am a psychopath. But I do not believe so. I have feelings. I still cry, or get scared, or become happy or angry. 

Yes, I've had unfortunate things happen to me. But no more than anyone else. But I am so self-entitled that I believe my problems need to be bigger to gain sympathetic looks.

I personally believe that this began partially because of fanfictions online. This began when I was fairly young. The fact that someone as young as I was at the time, had access to thousands of romanticized mental disorder stories is absolutely ludicrous.

I have read thousands of stories where the protagonist is an abused, self-harming, suicidal, anorexic person and someone else (98% of the time, a celebrity or fictional character) swoops in to save the day. These types of stories, I feel have aided me in who I am today.

Not to say it is all their faults, as it was I who clicked the stories and decided to read them. But think about it. At the time, I was going through some things. And imagine the impression that a romanticized mental health story such as those can have on someone who is suffering from one, who has no idea what they truly are or how to get help.

It confuses them. It lies, telling them they need someone else to save them. That having a mental disorder looks like how they portray them when it is really not. They are lying.

It is almost like an addiction. Reading those stories. I've wasted countless hours of my life in bed reading them. And the sad part is, I have no plans to stop.

This is the harsh truth. We are all liars. Just some people are more comfortable with it than others. I just fall towards the more comfortable side.

I've said what I needed to say. Thank you, if you've stuck around to the end.

But I've recently started on actual medications and I've been far more expressive and more open about things. But I've wonder does anyone else ever feeling like that? Just bottled it all up for unfounded paranoia?",24Feb2020,1

So recently I’ve been battling depression, bipolar, social anxiety, and mild schizophrenia and I feel like there is nothing to be happy about in my life and i am on a horrible path which my mental health could deteriorate more and more as I get older.

Forgive my rambling and hard to understand words, but here i go.

Basically, at school I don’t really have any friends, and I say not really because I do have one friend but he just constantly belittles me and calls me lazy when I haven’t done my homework. Sometimes he will say to others that I am ‘like a puppy’ because I follow him around. But we had known each other for a while and he does ask me to play overwatch sometimes.
In my neighbourhood there are some really annoying people my age who hang around in groups. Yesterday they kicked both my shins and took my money when I went to the shops, but I probably shouldn’t have gone round the back of the Tesco to the front. So nobody noticed because it was behind the shop.
At lunchtime I’m completely isolated, wondering around the school by myself and sometimes for no reason just emptying my water just to buy another one for something to do.
At home things aren’t great either because my parents are abusing me emotionally (insults, ruining confidence, controlling). I could go much deeper but want to keep it brief because nobody wants to read a giant post.

So for a couple months now I’ve been experiencing delusions which is a symptom of schizophrenia that I still believe even writing this post, even though they are not real. I know that seems hard to understand but that’s just how it is. I think I’m being punished by some godly being and being talked to through other people, almost like they have been possessed. It’s hard for me to trust people because I think this being is manipulating what they say and think to intentionally hurt me. I also have been experiencing audio hallucinations, people talking about me even though they have never spoken to me and are in the upper years (grades for us).

I have tried my best to take action. I have this incredible friendship with a music teacher who is really cool and meets with me on a Thursday lunchtime to talk about how I’m feeling. It’s nice for someone to treat me like a human being. He has spoken to staff upper in the school who arranged me to see the school nurse. I have been going but it’s not helping. I told her my problems but usually after there is a long period of silence until I talk more. If I don’t talk more she will just recommend getting a job or volunteering but when I ask her where I would find a job or something she doesn’t know where. 
She did tell me to go see the doctor. I was referred to CAHMS (UK Child mental health service) but when I mentioned to him about my schizophrenia he didn’t put it on my referral because he didn’t understand it. I haven’t self harmed, even though I do feel the impulse of it daily. And sometimes I do have scary thoughts of ending my life, even though I’m way too scared to act on them, and still believe there is a bit of hope for the future. 

Couple days later after my doctor appointment my mum got a letter from cahms. They said the first part of my ‘intervention’ would be to go to this place that is a charity and offers free counselling. But the counsellors are volunteers, and counselling is only a drop in on a Monday. I don’t think that would help much though.

My mum reading this letter thinks I don’t need it. I have nothing else to do but agree even though in my head I disagree. Not only is taking to my mum about my problems hard, but sometimes I feel like i should ignore my depression and maybe one day it will disappear. But this will never happen.

So now I feel hopeless and not sure what to do. This is simply ruining my life. School, social life (non existent) and at home. And my emotions, because I’ve felt numb for months now because of emotional repression.
God I feel like I’m being tortured

I know that most people in this subreddit are not mental health professionals but it would be nice to hear another perspective on my situation and maybe any coping methods. I know my problems are nothing compared to how much worse other people in this world are feeling, but I can’t do this anymore. Also having low self esteem and confidence isn’t nice.

Thanks for reading. Have a nice day.",24Feb2020,1
8,"Every couple of months I have a drastic elevated mood. My self-confidence goes through the roof, I feel like a queen who rules the world. I feel like I'm the prettiest, smartest and best person out there and that I can accomplish anything. In the last couple of years though, when these periods occur, I get incredibly anxious because I know that I'm going to crash HARD once this euphoria wears off.  I always get depressed for months after getting a week of bliss. I do everything in my power to try to extend this happiness but nothing makes it last. Its always accompanied by sadness no matter what I do. The worst part is whenever I'm in this happy stage, something deep down tells me ""this is going to be forever this time. You are going to be happy forever. You have finally reached self-love"". And then I syke myself up so much for this happiness lasting forever but it never ever does. I just feel so powerless and I feel like a slave to my emotions and mood and it just sucks that I can only be happy once every couple of months :( My last post was about how I was so thrilled to finally be content with my height (I'm a freakishly tall girl), but now I'm back to hating myself again. I was so excited to be happy forever. I actually thought it was going to last this time because this period lasted two weeks instead of my usual couple of days to one week. I feel like a fool. You know when you think things are going well with someone you like and you convince yourself that it's going to lead to a relationship but then it turns out it was just a fantasy and you made it up in your head? Well, that's how I feel every time this happiness wears off. I feel like I convinced myself that this time it was going to be different and that I truly love myself, but nope. It was all a fantasy. I don't love myself and I doubt I ever will. But I want to so bad. That's all I want in life is to love myself, something just won't let me.",24Feb2020,1

12,"As a child my step dad would snap me with a towel, flick me in the forehead, pick on me, make fun of me, and constantly yell at me. 

One time that I can remember he had me in a corner and was kicking me (but not hard enough to leave marks). He always wanted to make sure I felt small and insignificant. He used to tell me that if I ever thought I could beat him up that we could go to the back yard and I could try. He laughed at and mocked me so much. 

My sister recalls a time when he was hitting my head into a wall but I don’t remember that happening. 

Now (34yo) I have severe anxiety and suffer from an inferiority complex. I have trouble looking people in the eyes and I apologize a lot. I can’t access my emotions because when I did as a child I was told “stop crying or I’ll give you something to cry about” and if I kept crying he WOULD give me something to cry about. 

I don’t know who I am. I can’t find my strength.. and I really need some validation.

13,"Maybe this belongs more to r/art, r/gaming or r/writing, because this sensation feels linked to my storytelling knowledge in some twisted way.

Instead of just acting i first think ""how would Nicolás Serrano confront this issue?"" and then act like my persona would do. It's creepy and unnerving at times, and it just feels like my whole life is just a cinematic and I am still waiting for the game to give me control over my character. Alcohol was a great tool to deal with my mh issues, but each time i drink i become less affected by it, like i am in some constant state of drunkency (that's not even a word but who cares).

15,"i started antidepressants almost a month ago. the first week or two were incredibly difficult, but now i feel much better than before i started medication and the first week. i’ve been able to be a lot more optimistic and happier in general. i’ve only had one panic attack, as well (a huge improvement). i’m in high school, and my grades have always been very important to me even if the class doesn’t matter in the long run. overall, i’ve been more productive in everyday life and i have the motivation to leave bed, exercise and socialize- but i cannot seem to do any of my school work. i know i have to do it, but i just don’t. it doesn’t make sense to me because i used to always do my homework, i would stay up all night if i had to.

16,"Hello everybody, I want to share my experience with my first time smoking weed and how it has impacted me since. Even typing this is fairly difficult, so bare with me. Im 19 and on January 15th I smoked weed for the first time and I’ve haven’t been the same since. I thought smoking weed would relieve my anxiety that has been built up over the years but it did the exact opposite. 5 minutes into taking 3 big hits, it immediately hit me. My consciousness shifted totally. My whole body was extremely tight and I couldn’t feel anything. I felt as I was in a whole other universe and I felt like I was dying. My cousins rushed me to the emergency room and on the way there I shouted random things that came to my mind, even if they were inappropriate. I couldn’t even walk and they had to push me in a wheel chair. 

It felt like I was in literal hell and I didn’t even want to fall asleep because I thought I would never wake up again. I was extremely restless and they had to restrain me because of how I was acting. I can’t even recall what happened after that. The next morning I went home and still could barely walk. I went to sleep again and woke up with hospital equipment attached to me. I thought that was all a dream but it wasn’t, to this day I’m still hoping this is all a dream. When I got up to use the bathroom even touching the toilet felt extremely weird, as my senses changed. My mind felt completely empty, my sex drive was depleted, and I felt like a stranger in my own home. I was alarmed because this didn’t feel like normal  anxiety. As of this moment I have improved a little bit, but in some ways it has gotten worse. I’ve developed eye floaters and have been seeing flashes of lights. My body feels lethargic and slow. I don’t feel as sharp as I used to. My ears sometimes ring and I get sweaty hands and feet. The worst of all is my memory, as they feel scattered and my connections to them is off. The thing is I don’t have any delusions but it has still been the worst times of my life. I was able to handle normal anxiety and depression, but this is getting very hard.

I keep on hoping for the best and that over time I will return to normal, but it feels as i’ve fallen too hard. For the first time in my life I don’t like being alone and feel as I need constant attention. I have been having suicidal thoughts and really need some help. I hope I didn’t trigger schizophrenia but as I look up the symptoms everyday they match up to what I’m feeling. I’m seeing a neuro psychologist soon but I’m just wondering if anybody else has experienced something like this. Off of 3 hits of a joint my entire life has been fucked. Please if anybody has comments or know if I will recover words of encouragement please let me know because I really need them, thanks.",24Feb2020,1

19,"I’m 20 years old almost 21 in less then 2 weeks. I have trichotillomania, (irresistible urge to pull my hair). I’ve had it since 7th grade. I have an intake with a therapist in about 3 weeks but I’m at a loss. My social life has been completely ruined in terms of self esteem and anxiety I’m a mess. I can’t stand going into public areas where my hair is exposed. Hats are my safe haven and when I can’t where them I get really bad social anxiety, I don’t like when people look at me. If someone looks at my hair I freak out. Depending on the situation I sometimes almost have panic attacks. I won’t go swimming. I won’t go get my hair done. I have a hard time finding a job because I specifically look for a job where I can wear a hat to hide when I go through really bad relapses. At times I’m doing great others not so much and when I relapse it’s the worst getting on my feet is so difficult due to me getting depressed and having anxiety being around people I quit my job because I’m embarrassed about what others say and I don’t like when people tell me things about my hair “ why do I look bald” “ your hair is kinda messy today” I spend hours crying in the bathroom before work because I can’t figure out a way to style my hair where I won’t look bald. This eventually leads me to quitting my job (usually at this stage it’s so badly noticeable) going to job interviews is hard because I can’t cover my head and look professional or atleast I haven’t figured out a way to do so. It’s been years I feel so defeated I’ve tried so many things to try to stop the pulling but I can’t stop. I don’t want to do this to myself. It’s cost me so many opportunities it’s made me so depressed. I cut my hair 2 years ago hoping that maybe if I went cold turkey and cut my hair short enough to where I can’t grab it .... boy did I fuck up with that one. If anything it made my pulling worse. It went good for 297 days the longest I’ve EVER gone without pulling since 7th grade. After that total catastrophe damage I didn’t do to my hair in 7 years of having trich was now happening in days. I get anxiety I pull, I get stressed I pull sometimes I don’t even know I’m doing it. Sometimes I’m so stressed out I tell myself what’s the point it’s not like I can stop anyway. So here I am again I tried everything but I think I have to go cold turkey again. Going cold turkey for me is buzzing all my hair off but it breaks my heart because I hate having short hair! Everytime I cut my hair I can’t even look myself in the mirror. I can see everything all the damage I’ve done. My favorite pulling areas. I look like I have alopecia which some people actually confuse it with that. I’m depressed back at square one and what scares me the most is that my hair will only grow back so many times before I cause permanent hair damage so fuck my life!",24Feb2020,1
20,"So idek where to start off, it all started when I was around 12-13, it didn’t help that I had no friends and all I had was a phone, I got obsessed w a celebrity to the point where I convinced myself I did have a relationship w them, not even that I had this whole other world in my head, it wasn’t just fantasization either it was like those emotions were real that world was real and it felt so real to me, it was all I thought about all day and right before I went to bed, not only that I would go bizerk if I found out who his next girl (slept around a lot) was, I had this whole account “exposing” him and his girls and how he cheats on one of them but I y’all stemmed from jealousy, not even jealousy it felt like I was being cheated on almost, I harassed a lot of people and did a lot of fucked up shit and I didn’t even expose him Bc I hated him, I was hurt. This continued for years and I ended up convincing myself at one point I did have a relationship w him (I guess to validate my feelings idek at all). It stopped but not really, you see it’s continued but it’s continued to person to person, Ik that sounds weird but let me explain, it only “stops” when I find someone else to get obsessed with and I’ll do it all over again, it’s never stopped for a long period of time, around 14-15 I started having real relationships so it would transfer boyfriend to boyfriend, after we broke up I would do the same thing (even continue imagining and convincing myself we were together and those emotions in my head were real). On top of all this my paranoia has all’s been bad and has been progressively worse, I don’t just feel like people are talking behind my back I’ve convinced myself they ARE and can’t think otherwise, and I obsess over it too almost all day everyday. I’ve been told all the advice in the book and none of it works, “don’t think ab it” “don’t care ab shitty people you’re better” “replace a negative though w a positive” “you just don’t need to care and feed into them” over and over and over again for a couple years and it doesn’t work, it just goes straight through my head, doctors tell me nothings wrong and its just anxiety but I haven’t told them ab the other world in my head stuff Bc I’m scared of judgment (always Have been ab every little thing) and it’s like I feel fucking crazy and when someone tells you everything’s not that bad it makes

22,"I have been suffering from depression and anxiety my entire life, with my formal diagnoses happening during elementary school. I grew up in a dominantly Asian-American community, and my family, peers, and friends largely had severe misunderstandings regarding depression and mental health. I also had a very difficult childhood. Without getting into too much detail, I was an ""accident,"" abandoned by both parents (who were never married or in a serious relationship), and raised by my very poor, very weak grandparents; such an upbringing filled me with a lot of guilt, a lot of self-doubt, and occasional envy (I was VERY poor compared to many of my peers).

I reached out to a few friends, and opened up to a few exes, for support regarding my mental health, but, to be honest, most did not take me seriously. At first, most of them dismissed me as wanting attention or just being crazy. When I figured things out and found some better friends, a lot were supportive, but none I can think of really truly understood what I was going through.

Then I met my current boyfriend. He does not have depression or anxiety, nor did he have a tough childhood. However, he is very empathetic and VERY intelligent, which I think enhances his empathetic abilities. I feel like he truly gets me and is supportive of me. We have been together for over a year, and for the most part, things have been great. HOWEVER, he is a very sexual person, and has expressed a few times that he would like to have sex more often. About me: I have an extremely low libido. I do not watch any porn and do not masturbate. I've tried both maybe a couple of times in my early teens, and absolutely never did again. I have never liked or craved sex. I can have it once in a while when my anxiety, depression, and stress are affecting me at low levels, but otherwise can't without it feeling like a chore, regardless of how much I love the person. I told him this every time he brought up having sex more often. However, he has expressed that it is a big deal to him, and not having sex makes him feel undesired and frustrated. Each time he has brought it up, I become more anxious regarding sex and felt more pressure such that sex had become even less desirable. 

This situation incites several feelings, which I would like some advice on managing: 1) I feel very stressed because the one person who I feel like understands me also has this issue with a fundamental part of me: my low libido. 2) It adds to my serious doubts on my self-worth: he is not the first person I have dated who voiced concerns regarding sexual frequency. Even if my boyfriend and I were to break up (which isn't what I want), I feel 100% sure that I would encounter this issue with any other person I date after. I just feel too flawed as a person to live a normal life, which I desperately want. 3) The last feeling is anger. I feel like in this aspect, my boyfriend simply does not respect or understand the effects the depression has on me. I know this might enrage a few, but I have wished, at multiple points of my life, that I had a physical illness instead of a mental illness. If I were physically debilitated, I can't imagine any partner getting upset at my inability to have sex. However, such isn't the case with mental illness. There are of course other abilities that have been compromised due to my depression, which adds to this anger.

23,"24F depression and hypersomnia, I struggle with cognitive impairments like memory loss, inability to concentrate, racing thoughts, brain fog, trouble retaining things. 
From what I understand these are all common symptoms of my disorders. 

My psychologist however recommended I get neuropathological testing done- a full set of tests including memory, personality.. she says she wants to rule everything out, get a better understanding of what’s going on. 

The test is $2400. I’m scheduled to do it this Friday. I don’t know what to do because I’m supposed to trust my therapist but also I’m convinced this is a waste of money. The tests won’t change anything and I already know what’s causing the symptoms. 

Any advice? Is this testing common and/or helpful?

24,"A bit of an odd query indeed and I’m not even sure if this is the right place to put it, but the point is I struggle deeply with sexual arousal.

I don’t mean that I can’t achieve it, it’s the exact opposite. When I am aroused it’s almost like I’m a different person. All of my reasoning and morals just disappear from me, and the only thing I want to do is just fuck. Obviously that’s the whole point of being sexually aroused, but for me it can get so strong that I am unable to resist temptations, and it has led me to do some very regrettable things before. I don’t want these things to happen again.

25,"I feel like I have dual personalities. So most of the time I am quite normal and I feel every emotion. But at times I have this phase where I'm very cold blooded, just no feeling at all, completely opposite of what I am normally. This phase usually comes during some negative environment like a funeral or witnessing a crime or accident. Sometimes I tend to purposely bring out this phase.

I feel loved and love my inner circle, laugh, cry, get angry at times etc. Now I've cried and cried a lot when my dog passed away but I've also witnessed a man getting his head crushed under an 18 wheeler and I just walked it off like nothing, I wasn't shocked, I just didn't have any reaction and I was like welp R.I.P. while I saw others shouting, crying and just everyone around me was traumatized.

26,"So idek where to start off, it all started when I was around 12-13, it didn’t help that I had no friends and all I had was a phone, I got obsessed w a celebrity to the point where I convinced myself I did have a relationship w them, not even that I had this whole other world in my head, it wasn’t just fantasization either it was like those emotions were real that world was real and it felt so real to me, it was all I thought about all day and right before I went to bed, not only that I would go bizerk if I found out who his next girl (slept around a lot) was, I had this whole account “exposing” him and his girls and how he cheats on one of them but I y’all stemmed from jealousy, not even jealousy it felt like I was being cheated on almost, I harassed a lot of people and did a lot of fucked up shit and I didn’t even expose him Bc I hated him, I was hurt. This continued for years and I ended up convincing myself at one point I did have a relationship w him (I guess to validate my feelings idek at all). It stopped but not really, you see it’s continued but it’s continued to person to person, Ik that sounds weird but let me explain, it only “stops” when I find someone else to get obsessed with and I’ll do it all over again, it’s never stopped for a long period of time, around 14-15 I started having real relationships so it would transfer boyfriend to boyfriend, after we broke up I would do the same thing (even continue imagining and convincing myself we were together and those emotions in my head were real). On top of all this my paranoia has all’s been bad and has been progressively worse, I don’t just feel like people are talking behind my back I’ve convinced myself they ARE and can’t think otherwise, and I obsess over it too almost all day everyday. I’ve been told all the advice in the book and none of it works, “don’t think ab it” “don’t care ab shitty people you’re better” “replace a negative though w a positive” “you just don’t need to care and feed into them” over and over and over again for a couple years and it doesn’t work, it just goes straight through my head, doctors tell me nothings wrong and its just anxiety but I haven’t told them ab the other world in my head stuff Bc I’m scared of judgment (always Have been ab every little thing) and it’s like I feel fucking crazy and when someone tells you everything’s not that bad it makes
Me feel like it’s just me. I’m so frustrated idk what it’s is or if it’s just me I’m going insane, someone please help. EDIT: also I have huge outbursts when it comes to this stuff (or anything that makes me mad most of the time) like I almost black out but not really (irl how to explain) and go crazy, a couple minutes afterwards (sometimes seconds) I’m completely normal and making a joke, it’s even been pointed out by people EDIT: yes I’ve told the doctors to an extent about obsessing over ex’s but not about the obsessive lurking and caring and believing I’m with them in my head and I’m on meds and I’ve been through so many and they don’t fucking work",24Feb2020,1

I wrote this when I had a revelation about myself. I knew I've been depressed my whole life. I knew I had severe anxiety and I hated myself more than words can explain. But I thought it was completely my fault - that I was a broken person. I thought I would never heal. I thought nobody would ever understand me. I just recently realized that my childhood abuse has completely shaped who I am as an adult. I never before made the connection between my childhood abuse and who I am today. It wasn't simply just a ""chemical imbalance; end of story"". You may not have experienced anything even remotely similar to what I have, but I hope after reading this some of you will start thinking and start seeing connections to your inner abused child that is still suffering from what happened to you in the past. 
(Please google CPTSD if you haven't already heard of it.)

.
.
.

I'm gonna vent about this because I know I'm not the only one. This is something that I just recently realized and it takes a lot of weight off my shoulders to finally know why I am the way I am. This was really an eye opener for me. This is my story. *TW*

The worst part about child abuse is for a lot of us, we are too young to understand that we're even being abused. Especially in terms of emotional abuse. We don't know any different. We grew up being treated like this, and we know something doesn't feel right, but we decide it must be a problem with us. ""We accept the love we think we deserve."" 
Thankfully I did know that the physical abuse I was receiving was not okay, but honestly it took me 24 years to fully realize that I was emotionally abused as a child. 24 YEARS.

I was emotionally and physically abused by my parents and other family members (mostly my mother) starting as a very very young child, possibly infant. Of course as a child you are incapable of understanding that you are not to blame. Because of this, I believed that I was broken, horrible, and stupid. I thought something was wrong with me. Why else would my parents not love me? In my own eyes I had to be at fault. Something was wrong with me. Even as a preschooler and kindergartener I have memories of thinking ""why do I have to be me?"" and ""what's wrong with me?"". My self esteem was non-existent. 

I remember going to my pediatric doctor due to a skin infection I had as a kindergartener. I had to see this doctor weekly, and because she was so kind to me (as a doctor should be, or any adult honestly) I started to see her as a parent figure. She made me feel loved and safe when my own mother did not. I remember I brought her a picture of me that we got from school picture day. She told my parents that I must have asperger's because of how socially awkward I was and how I acting around her (the doctor.) This later proved to be false, but again added to my feeling that I was broken and bad. We stopped seeing that doctor and my parents were furious at me. Why was it not clear to this doctor that I was insecurely attached?

My self esteem and hatred towards myself only got worse as time went on, and by 4th grade I was having full on almost passing out panic attacks. Started as hypochondria, but quickly became social anxiety. I could NOT function in school because I felt so uncomfortable in my own skin. Nobody wanted to be my friend. Nobody cared about me. The teachers HATED me. And then at home, nobody loved me. When people would look at me I wanted to just disappear. I made myself believe that I was incapable of making friends or being likable which in turn basically made me be unlikable. Ironic. Nobody wanted to be around me because my anxiety made me very awkward. I viewed myself as lesser than everyone else which would follow me into adulthood. Eventually I could not talk in front of the class. If I even knew I had to say a single word in front of the class or have everyone look at me I would literally run out of the room. Complete full on flight mode. Instead of being diagnosed with ANXIETY, I was diagnosed with ADHD. I couldn't focus because I was probably always disassociating. School was not the most important thing in my mind because at both at home and at school I was trying to survive. Why on earth would school be the first thing on my mind? 

Of course I fell behind in school and struggled to keep up with assignments which in turn made me feel even more stupid. When they had psychologists coming in to my classroom to study me, it only worsened my hatred towards myself. ""They're only watching me and studying me because there's something wrong with me."" I started seeing the school psychologist, therapist and social worker weekly. I was put into remedial classes and on an IEP. I was placed in some classes with children with severe behavioral and intellectual disabilities. I was forced to take IQ tests. In 6th grade I was literally forced to STACK BLOCKS while a psychologist watched. I'll never forget seeing the notes the psychologist wrote after that. ""Lots of nervous laughter."" No shit. I'm 12 and you're having me stack 5 blocks in a specific pattern. This is after they found out I had an average IQ, mind you. Everything that they did, whether they were trying to help or not, made me feel worse about myself. ""Why can't I be like the regular kids?"" is all that went through my brain. Every single thing that happened to me only solidified the belief in my head that something was wrong with me.

I was embarrassed of my own existence.

When I'd go home and try to explain that I would shake and be so scared that I couldn't even think straight in school my parents would just scream at me. I remember getting punched in the stomach and told to suck it up after just trying to explain what was going on. I had no one to turn to. 

By 7th grade I could not go to school. If I knew I'd have to work with other students or even be looked at in front of the class I would skip school. And honestly, it wasn't that school itself was a problem. I liked school itself. I couldn't function with my low self esteem and hatred towards myself. I constantly felt singled out. I felt bad that other people even had to look at me. I was too young to put this into words, and all I was able to say to anyone about what was going on was that talking in front of the class makes me scared and shakey. 

After I started getting in trouble for missing so much school (after the school social worker and principal drove to my house to talk to my parents and do a wellness check on my family), I went with extreme measures. Even running away from home and hiding which ended up with the police looking for me. All because I didn't want to have to panic. I tried to explain my anxiety in the best way a child can without even understanding what anxiety is. I was treated like a delinquent child instead.
Ended up in court after missing hundreds of days of school and had to do weeks of community service. AT 12 YEARS OLD.

I was showing so many signs of an abused child and I had definitely brought up my family physical abuse multiple times to adults at school and nobody heard me. Nobody. I was not a delinquent. I was suffering so noticeably yet somehow nobody noticed. 

By high school I refused to wear my glasses so I wouldn't have to see people looking at me in the hallway. I was still in remedial classes all those years later, which were mostly for kids with behavioral issues.  Kids that would kick, fight, scream, do drugs, you name it - this was not me at all.  I think I gave up trying to speak out because I tried so many times and I couldn't get anyone to hear me. I ended up dropping out of high school.

Fast forward to three years ago when I was going to pursue my dream of studying and then hopefully teaching abroad in Japan. Saved up for three years for my student visa and relearned everything from the ground up to get my GED. Did both things, got accepted and started my Japanese school in Tokyo. Never in my life had I been so proud of myself. I didn't even believe I was capable of accomplishing anything in my life. The moment that plane landed I cried my first ever happy tears.

Two weeks into language school, we were going around the table of probably 20 other students learning verbs at a very fast pace. I remember time slowing down while I was waiting for it to be my turn, then I blacked out. When I came to I ran out of the classroom. I left school and walked around Tokyo sobbing. I had gotten that far and somehow completely forgot how bad my self esteem and anxiety are. My dreams completely clouded out the truth. I knew I couldn't continue with school so I dropped out, then impulsively blew all of my tuition money that I saved for years on bullshit. After coming home I hit rock bottom and was hospitalized. Once again, the belief that I was broken was renewed in my mind.

At the hospital I was told ""you're not severe enough for inpatient treatment"". The doctor spent a total of maybe 4 minutes with me. Asked me a couple questions, checked me for head injuries, and left. I went to the hospital because I knew that if I went back home I was going to end my life. I was so used to stuffing my emotions down into myself at this point in my life that even if I was on the edge of ending it all - I looked calm. I even explained to them this. After waiting 6 hours after seeing the doctor, they sent me to a place thats only purpose was to keep you from harming yourself. Great, but when I went back home I learned nothing. No coping skills, didn't talk to a single mental health professional, nothing. I was back at square one. I reached out for help for the first time as an adult and was again, failed.

Inside my head was still the once tiny little girl wondering, ""what is wrong with me?""

Memories of my childhood were again, flashing back. I sat in my room for months. I couldn't leave the house. I had no desire to exist. I ripped up every baby photo I had with my mother in them. I honestly thought I wouldn't live another year. I was going to end up killing myself. I lost all of my hope.

Now, a couple years after that I'm finally now just getting the real help I need. I had to be the one to keep reaching out. It was very hard, but I am so glad I did. I'm so glad that I chose to fight for my life. I searched for a long time for a good psychiatrist and therapist. I finally found someone who heard me. I have even been able to forgive people who abused me. Of course I still and always will have scars, but now I am able to cope with them. 
I now know I am not broken. I am a survivor and I have been and was just trying to survive. People are shocked when I tell them I have ""social anxiety."" Eventually I will go back to Japan when I am actually ready. Learning about CPTSD and realizing WHY I am the way I am has been extremely important to me. Just like I'm finally connecting the dots. I'm finally starting to love myself. The little girl that once felt so unloved is finally healing.

I encourage all of you to learn how your trauma affects you, and know that you can also heal from it. 💕 I hope this inspired someone out there that is in an awful place like I once was. 

Please remember: You're not broken. You're surviving.

The cycle of abuse ends with us!",24Feb2020,1
32,"  

Hey guys, I apologize for the length of this post, but I’d like to go into detail and I would appreciate if some are able to read this! I sustained an injury back in June 2019, and I haven’t felt the same both physically and mentally, yet doctors have not been able to find what’s wrong with me. I’ll explain my story 

In early June 2019, I jumped off a train (I live right by a train yard) going around 15 – 20 mph. Yes, I know I’m an idiot but there’s nothing I can do now about it besides learn from my severely stupid mistake. I landed on the right side of my body and rolled around a couple times. Fortunately, I do not believe I hit my head, I definitely sustained whiplash though. A couple days after the fall, I started experiencing severe back and neck pain. The pain was all along my spine; cervical, thoracic, and lumbar. I decided to see my primary care doctor mid-July and explained I fell out of a tree. Very silly on my part but I was too embarrassed to explain the actual scenario. He decided to send me to Physical Therapy, but there was a major issue coming.

Physical Therapy helped but then I had an insurance layover for the month of August. Additionally, around the last day of PT, I started feeling this pain on the side of my neck, it was both on the right side of my neck and also toward the front. I could not seek any medical help for the whole month under coverage, everything would have to be out of pocket. This was the WORST month of my life. The pain I was experiencing was still terrible, and I convinced myself that I had some sort of nerve issue or herniated disc. I would wake up every night with pain and the thought that I may not be able to move my legs if this goes untreated. This is where my anxiety started kicking in badly, the thought of a severe issue with my back/neck but not being able to afford an MRI without health insurance. To add onto this, I used to smoke marijuana frequently prior to the fall but now, a couple of the times I was high I would get this pain in my throat/front of the neck that made me worry that this could have been caused by the fall, very similar to the area of which I started experiencing side neck pain on the last day of Physical Therapy. I would think that my throat was closing which terrified me, I stopped smoking weed until further notice. At work, I would also freak out at least once a day, thinking that my throat was closing or that my back was going to snap. I started getting a bit lightheaded as well.

Luckily, I made it to September and decided to see another doctor. Still being too embarrassed about telling the truth, I figured if I was able to make a good enough lie up I would be able to still get MRI’s on my spine.  My philosophy was: Radiologists don’t take how they fell into consideration, an injury is an injury, and an injury will pop up in an MRI.

Between October and November, I received four MRI’s: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and of my brain. My mom has MS so they wanted to take an MRI of my brain to make sure none of my symptoms were caused from that. Luckily, all MRI’s came back negative.

Around this time, I also started feeling some tingling in my chest. I went to the hospital for an EKG and the EKG also came back negative. 

Physical Therapy carried on (ended in late December) and I felt a lot better physically. I am now back to working out and running pretty regularly but I STILL have some back and neck pain along my spine, I’m satisfied knowing that my pain is only musculoskeletal though. I wouldn’t be surprised if my back and neck pain came from sitting at an office 40 hours a week. Please note that the pain/stiffness near my throat (front right side of my neck) and the whole right side of my neck has not gone away yet. I wish I knew why, but I don’t.

Pertaining to my throat closing sensation and stiff on the right side of my neck, I decided to get this further checked out to see where the throat tightness could be coming from. I have gotten a thyroid blood test, thyroid ultrasound, and a throat specialist to look down my throat to see if anything was stuck, and all problems have come back negative. I also started noticing my heartbeat for about 2-3 weeks out of my left ear, but eventually that went away.

While in December, I began to notice two bumps on the right side of my neck. Heading back to the neck doctor, he ordered for me to have a CDC blood test to make sure I didn’t have any serious diseases like lymphoma. The CDC came back with normal results besides high cholesterol and low vitamin D (I now take Vitamin D supplements and have been watching what I eat). The bumps are apparently just lymph nodes, and they have not grown in size since December. 

Fast forward to present day, and like I said earlier, I’m back to working out and running with some slight pain in my back and neck. The stiffness on the right side of my neck and near my throat has not gone away yet, but these are only physical issues. Mentally, I still feel completely off. Sometimes during work, I will be walking and feel off balance. In addition, I am constantly lightheaded, sometimes feel faint, fatigued, and have anxiety and memory issues. The worst part of this is the feeling that I am not myself, like derealization/depersonalization. All my imaging and exams have come back negative, and doctors are just playing this off as anxiety and me being traumatized from my fall and the stress following it, but I don’t know why I can’t get back to being the confident person I used to be. I still feel like something is wrong with me. It has completely affected my social life; all I want to do is be home where I feel safe incase something bad happened to me like my throat closed or I fainted. I’ve began thinking that maybe I’m not getting enough oxygen in me, but I believe during the EKG I was given one of those devices that clip onto your thumb to check your oxygen levels. My fingertips are also not blue like I’ve read in low-oxygen symptoms. Even in present day, I can’t smoke weed otherwise I’ll think my throat is closing, and it seems like I have throat pain. 

I decided to see a psychologist, so I first saw one a week ago and we both agreed it would be a good idea to tell a doctor the truth. So I did, I told a spinal doctor and had him look at the MRI’s knowing that I fell out of a train, still nothing found. While I feel more relaxed about that, I still have the same lightheaded, fatigued, faint, anxiety and depersonalization feelings that I’ve had for months now.

My question to anyone who took the time to read this, has anyone felt like this before? Did you keep looking for doctors and eventually something was found or diagnosed? If not, have you found a way to combat your mental feelings? Has your situation improved since your experience?

Any feedback from my story would be greatly appreciated, and please feel free to share your story too. I truly thank anyone who has taken the time to read this.",24Feb2020,1

38,"I married my wife young. I love her. She's the light of my life. But over the years I've fought an identity crisis. I still do on the daily. Most recently she found out I'd been cutting myself and asked me what was so horrible about my life that I felt the need to cut. I finally broke down into a panic attack and told her it's been so heavy on my mind that I feel the need to transition...but she assumed that life with her is so bad that I need to change it. That's not it at all and I wish she would see things my way. I'm dead inside, I cant look at myself in mirrors, I cant look down at my chest hair or hear my own voice or stand being called handsome anymore. I hate these stupid clothes and this stupid face. But more than anything I hate my stupid self for getting into this mess. I hope she never reads this but I know one day she will. I won't move on into the life I dreamed of because I love you. But I'm going to regret my life every day. I regret putting on these clothes to go to work to be called my name and be one of the guys. Regret that I didnt hide the cut marks better so you wouldn't hide the sharp object from me. Regret that I ruined your life by trapping you in this marriage. You brighten my life up with your smile and your compassion and your ambitions. But I've arrived in Hell and I dont see a way out. Only a way to slip deeper down every day.

They've named themselves and it comforts me to know who's talking when they're talking, a lot of them sound different but there's a few that sound like me.

# Addiction- Fight The Battle Just For One Day

 

Anyone actively battling an addiction will tell you that if you cut the battle down from forever to just one day at a time, it is achievable.

Everyone who’s engaged in addictive behavior will experience uncomfortable cravings at one point or another during recovery. One day or one year into the journey, it can happen. As an addict it is always good to be aware of your feeling. One’s behaviors can change on a dime when cravings are creeping in.

&amp;#x200B;

**SOME GENERAL BEHAVIORS TO BE AWARE OF**

* Preoccupying thoughts about the substance of choice
* A desire to return to old using spots or see old using friends.
* Wanting to use drugs or alcohol when something reminds you of them.
* Buying substance-related paraphernalia.

As mentioned in previous blogs I am grateful to be a sober alcoholic today, just one day at at time and only one day at a time. If I keep that mind set and realize that if I am having a day where I am thinking back to when the drinking was fun, I try to stop the dangerous thinking and tell myself that the thoughts will pass, and eventually they always do.

**I have a difficult time being positive**, despite the happy face people see everyday. An addictive personality and being bipolar can be challenging obstacles, but I know that the more I try to be positive the better I become at it. And in turn I have had less and less cravings as the years pass. Make no mistake, I feel that cravings may be a battle I will always face, but if I can get through them they have never lasted more than a day, and I know if I ride out the storm tomorrow is a new day.

The hard truth is that the odds are stacked against us addicts with regards to relapse. According to the **National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism**, up to 90% of alcoholics will have at least one relapse during the first four years after they get sober. However, the way a recovering alcoholic handles a relapse is key to their long-term sobriety. **This is why I feel that positive thinking is everything.**

&amp;#x200B;

I have stumbled many times along my journey of recovery, it is the guilt and shame that had always been my road block to my recovery. I still live with the guilt and shame everyday of my life, but I also try to realize that my past does not define who I am.

An old timer with more years of sobriety than years I had been alive once told me after I had relapsed, **“pick yourself up, dust yourself off and remember tomorrow is a new day.”** I wanted to tell him off, until the following day, when I woke up. He was right. the sun rose and life went on. It was up to me to accept this fresh start as a gift. I was sober and it was day one. I have had several day ones in my life, but I picked up tools and lessons from every one of these hard experiences.",24Feb2020,1
41,"I've been diagnosed with mild depression for about 2 months, and ADHD since I was 8. But ever since September of 2019, shit has been going downhill for me. 

Static electricity seems to hurt more, and is happening more frequently. I get up from leather couch? Painful shock. I get out of my car? Painful shock when I touch the metal door.
Put my airpods in? Shock in my ears. Touch my computer? An arc forms between my PC and my hand. This might just be me worrying but it's alot more frequent
Ringing in my ears is getting progressively worse, my jaw pops and grinds. That might be tinnitus and the ringing comes in waves. Along with a rumbling ring??
I'm incredibly paranoid, if my parents walk downstairs, I won't notice them, even if they make noise, it's only until they come into close vacinity that I notice them, and it almost always scares me. I had my first sleep paralysis incident in October, and haven't had any since. I see running figures in the corners of my eye, and hear taps on the ceiling and floor. I usually am in my basement adjacent to the boiler, so it may be that. I get thoughts of creatures chasing me, not like ghosts. I mean orwellian monsters, like small eyes and skinny limbs. I sit at my computer with my back to the windows, and the curtains don't cover them clearly, so I look back every 5 minutes for safety. I can only sleep in the corner of my bed with pillows over my head, or on the couch with lights on.

Anybody know what this could be? Worsening depression or what?",24Feb2020,1
42,"disclaimer: i am already doing mental treatment, atm we are working in anxiety, anger management issues and trying to figure out wether i am trans or not, i am taking light meds atm for anxiety and stress.

TLDR: i get really stressed in places where people dont stay silent, and even get to blow up depending on the severity, i dont really mind noise... water flowing, cars passing(without the honking), etc... as long as its not human voices its fine, it doesnt matter if its just two people chatting at a low volume or if its hundreads of people competing to see who screams louder, i haye both. i am curious if this is just a symptom of anxiety or whatever or if its a condition itself.

i planned tgis to be context but it ended up being a vent/storytime: so today i went to a waterpark, pretty big and famous place, but my ma and aunt decided it would be a good idea to have their lockers on the ""complexo amazonico"" area, which is just the fortnite of the park, throw all the crotch goblings there and keep them away from the humans. now imagine the situation, i am in my 20's, and i cant stand crowded places, neither can i stand kids (while i do plan to adopt a child or marry a mother/father, i am of the belief that only those who are raising the child have to suffer/pay for it), so places where hundreads of karens let their little goblings raze the place to the ground and raise the decibel level of the area tenfold, are not my cup of tea really... honestly any place with more than 10 people is enough to stress me out if there is one or more persons talking, i know i am the oddball, but i prefer silence, calmness etc... so there i am standing in a place with hundreads of people where the noise is so loud i need to scream 15cm from my mother's face just so she can hear me, and the 15m it took for them to figure out how to use the locker system was enough to put me past my boiling point, and when a random child ran past me shrieking like a 200km/h car's tires when flooring the breaks, i just sorta blew up, and released prolly my biggest ""FUCK"" shout yet, ofc did not do much to the place as a whole, but the kid next to me slipped and cried, while my family and the worker helping them stood there looking at me like i just said 6 millions was'nt enough...",24Feb2020,1
43,"What's the best method to overcome a failure of exponential and life-altering magnitude?

I've gone through a wide range of emotional, mental and spiritual swings over the years based upon one key miscalculation.

Lately, I've been dealing with it by coming to terms with significantly downsizing my dreams and ambitions - and trying to become content with being perfectly average.

This is not my favorite conclusion, but the only other strategy that has been persistent is toxic compartmentalization and that is a painful and illusioned strategy.

44,"Little bit of backstory, so growing up I was raised by a single mother with multiple ""dad's"" along the way, I met my real dad when I was ~12 because he had cancer (he used to abuse my mom). My mom was a little neglectful when she was raising me, and she sent me to live with my dad at 14. My dad treated me like shit. Anyway, I have ADHD, OCD, and depression, and my early adulthood up until 4 years ago was pretty much making the wrong friends, drug use, and doing stupid things. The last 4 years I've been more stable, and clean, but because of my sometimes uncontrollable emotions I would quit jobs without notice. I've since learned that it's REALLY not good to do that, because now I can't use them as a reference. The point I'm getting at is I'm very unmotivated because I feel like even if I apply to good jobs (I just finished a technical diploma program) that I won't get them anyway, so it's like what's the point.. they'll just find out about my past of quitting jobs and probably not give me a chance.",24Feb2020,1

     Okay, to start off I’ve been feeling this way since I was about 9-10? I felt really empty(?), it felt like an impending dooming was awaiting me and tbh I didn’t think I’d make it past 5th grade. I just couldn’t see myself after 5th grade, I probably thought I’d die or something, who the hell knows. Anyways by the time I turned 11 I cut for the first time, it was small and I made the dumb mistake of putting it on my arms. It went away for the most part but throughout my day, I would think about committing suicide. It would happen every other day or so, it felt awful, I felt like a fraud and I still do. I keep thinking about it, but I’ve always stopped myself because “who would clean up my body? My family shouldn’t have to see me dead or my family would lose so much money from a funeral.” I’ve thought about telling my family but who’d believe me? They’d think since I’m a teenager, I’m probably making it up but am I? I really don’t know, I think I might cave soon. Just go somewhere discreet and off myself, but I’m a pussy so I’ll probably not do it. Anyways that’s about it, am I faking it though? I can’t tell.",24Feb2020,1

50,"Hey guys,

I made an account since my friend said Reddit is a good place to post just about anything. I’m here to just spill out some things that are going on in my life and I don’t know what to do. A big part of me just wants to never wake up. (I will never actually off myself btw). 

•      My dad flies down often to my house to see his grand daughter and to get out of the cold weather. He left on day three because I came home from class to find the house completely trashed, my MCAT (medical school entrance exam) book set scrambled all over the floor, slime in the carpet, etc. I wasn’t happy about it and I sternly scolded my daughter (who is only 4) about not touching my books. I don’t even know how she got it since they were pretty high up on the bookshelf. 
        Long story short, he started yelling at me that I shouldn’t yell at my kid. I wasn’t yelling though...  essentially he said they were just stupid books and I snapped back at him saying “I’m sorry you’ve never owned a nice book set that you really cared about and they’re extremely expensive.” He threw the dishes in the sink and yelled at me to take him to the airport. We haven’t spoken since. This is the second time he walked out on me.. the first time being on my graduation day. That’s another long story. But I’m hurt and played the scenario out in my head over and over, and I know both times I wasn’t in the wrong. I feel the connection between my dad and I is decaying and his actions are hard for me to forgive him for. 

•    My husband has only been home for four months in an entire year. And he’s gone again for another three months. He’s active duty military and I understand he doesn’t have control in how often he leaves. But holy cow, I’m so stressed out with college and my daughter who is very very very hyper. I can never keep the house clean for more than an hour with her being home. I’m so exhausted and I feel like I can never catch my breath. 
       My husband is a good dad, but he gets frustrated with her so easily when he’s home. When he’s gone for work, he gets to sleep in, drink every night, and only work for about five hours in the day, gets weekends off, etc. He’s pretty content on the places he’s been to. And I can’t help but feel bitter since he seems to get a lot of freedom. 

•     Him being gone the last year, dealing with depression, getting off adderall, working, and playing single parent for an entire year has taken a huge toll on my GPA. I feel discouraged that I will never get into medical school, unless if I enroll in an intensive masters program or work as some sort of medical tech for 5+ years (maybe). I had a 3.6 and now barely sitting at a 3.0. 

•    Most importantly I feel like a terrible parent. I’m so busy and exhausted that when my daughter comes home from pre school she just wants the iPad, I cave in and let her watch YouTube videos so I can clean, make dinner, or go study for an exam. I feel like I’ve been neglecting her since my husband left and I hate it. But today I feel a little bit better since we went to the mall and eat ramen together at a restaurant. But overall she’s by herself a lot and I don’t have the energy to play, since she wants me to chase her 24/7. 

Essentially, I feel like my dreams are being held off or suffering because of several factors, the ones above especially. Everyday my husband begs to have more kids but I especially don’t want to cause I’m tired of pretending to be a single parent and having this enormous workload. If more kids were involved I would probably leave everyone. It sounds terrible, and I don’t know how many mothers do it, but it’s just not for me. 

One thing to ask is if I should get help.. I feel anxious all the damn time. I get panic attacks twice a month. I’m ALWAYS agitated. And I don’t know if medication really helps.

55,"I've been helping a local schizophrenic for the past 5-6 months and things have been going really well in helping her situation and being a friend. The one thing I cannot seem to find any information about or see come up in here is how the 'others' take over her speech. We will be talking and all of a sudden her face/eyes will go blank and she'll start talking in a very fast/low voice to herself. The voices change but they 'take over' her speech, sometimes it seems they're talking to each other but she's gone during. When I've asked her what she was whispering she has no recollection of the voices, she completely steps out for a few seconds.

59,"hello! 17M here idk if that’s relevantso for the past few years i feel like i have social anxiety, but i’m not that certain. or idk what i have tbh.

whenever i’m out on a public setting or what not i always fear of who i’m going to meet and find possible routes to evade seeing them. maybe there’s another entrance to the mall/exit that no one really uses, so i would use that way to avoid seeing people, this happens rarely, but still occurs. most commonly during the weekdays, when my friends/seniors/juniors are in school(i’m not bc i’m on like this programme), i would usually go out and buy stuff early in the morning like usually 10? or 11 as they would still be in school. i overthink a lot, is this normal? as much as possible i do not want to engage in any form of communication AT ALL with them. However, when i’m with my classmates and close friends, i’m not afraid of those things at all. I feel safe around them. All my worries would disappear if my friend was with me. 

This gets worse when i’m with my family members. Whenever they display affection to me or like idk(i’m a person that doesent show affection yet idk i still love them??? idk i’m that type of person that doesent show it) i feel super super uncomfortable/disturbed and like i fear of what others think of me. it’s so bad, and i feel bad about it. Sometimes I wish they would even disappear.

Long story short my mom loves me a lot, but she just doesent know how to show it. Asian problems I guess. A few months back I self harmed myself bc she kept commenting on how I look, how I behaved and made comments about my appearance and idk if she even fucking realises it lmao. and when i self harmed/have a breakdown, she would demand me to come out of the door and she would apologise and what not and sometimes push the blame onto me. I don’t know what to do even lol what the fuck and she thinks it’s my friends that are at fault when i feel depressed or down when in reality it’s all her. i cant even tell her bc she would just get angry and all and idek whats wrong with me urgh....my close friends were the sole reason i felt safe and without them idt i would even make it this far. 

I would also want to learn ways of becoming more open. I’m very susceptible to others perception about me, I’m very afraid of what others think of me and judge me. This plays a huge role in my life and I don’t know how to make it go away. Any tips? I’m enrolling in this programme in like a college? And I have tons of presentations, i’m very fearful about that.... I want to be more sociable and I need to be more confident. Tips?...

 idk what to even describe this, can someone help? Is this social anxiety or what? am i just a sensitive fuck",24Feb2020,1

Though I’ve never been to a therapist or had any diagnosis, I felt this was a good place to talk. For the past few days I’ve been completely void of any emotions, other than a few seconds of crying here or there.

My whole family has awful mental health ie. anxiety depression bipolar. They’ve all been to therapy but my parents don’t seem to notice that I might be in pain too. I drank a very caffeinated drink in hopes of feeling anything, then all I had was fidgety nervousness. When that was gone I was numb again. I haven’t shared anything more than feeling sad with anyone. When I think I don’t feel ashamed of being numb or sad or anything, but when it comes to talking to someone I can’t bring myself to expose my feelings. When I get asked if I’m ok I never fail saying some variation of yea I’m fine.

I've recently been feeling like my therapist isn't a super good fit and that we've kind of plateaued in terms of progress. The last session I had with my therapist, she touched on something I'm admittedly defensive about, which left me feeling uncomfortable and it just felt like to me, the session kind of ended on a bad note. Because of that, I've been thinking about the last couple of months in therapy and how there's been a few things that I don't like about working with her; namely I don't feel like her type of therapy (EMDR) has been effective for me, and there's just been a few times where I strongly disagreed with a specific observation or assessment of me.

Here's the hard part: I have a lot of anxiety and a codependent personality. The anxiety is telling me she's gonna think I wanna see someone else because of that one comment in the last session and that I'm overreacting. The codependent part of me is telling me that I need to just stick it out and that I can't say no because I don't know what's best for me.

Currently I'm planning on going to one more session and then trying to find a way to stop seeing her. how should I do this? I'm a little afraid to bring it up in session because I worry the people pleasing part of me will fold and be pulled back in to avoid conflict (something I have a history of doing with psychiatrists and in personal relationships).

63,"About a year ago I got out of an abusive friendship which left me with a lot of trust issues, anxiety, depression, and physical marks of her abuse even a year on. She would make me buy her expensive stuff (I was 14 at the time and had to steal my parents card in order to keep her happy as my job was not paying enough to keep up with her weekly demands for video games, weekends out without me, and food) ( I feel like it's also important to note that she was from a well to-do family, we were both attending a privet Catholic school, I was on a scholarship because I couldn't afford it otherwise where as all of her 3 siblings had gone through before hand so they definitely had money), she would beat me if I slightly disagreed or expressed my opinion, and threaten outing me if I didn't do everything she said (Im transgender). 
I ran into a mutual friend yesterday who informed me that she had attempted suicide a few weeks ago. I feel guilty that maybe it was my actions that turned her to it, but I'm also happy that she finally felt the pain that I had felt the whole 5 years of our friendship. She has apparently also lost her friendship with another girl who she abused for 10 years (this other girls mother had server medical conditions meaning that she had to go to school, work, and take care of her mother and if this girl ever chose the mother over the friend, she would hit her)
I'm not really a stranger to suicide as Ive attempted multiple times because of various situation that all come back to feeling like I wasn't a good enough friend and she had told me I wasn't enough and that I have no one other than her. Every time she found out she would ignore me for a month and then tell me how selfish I was (which is one of my greatest fears; being selfish and ignoring everyones needs to suit my own needs).
I feel so angry at myself for being happy that she nearly died, but I feel so guilty like this was my fault. I know for a fact that if we were still in contact she would have said it was my fault. I know it's not but I feel such intense guilt. Someone please tell me if this is normal.

Here I have no good friends and everything feels dull and I hate it. This darkness creeps on me knowing that things will stay the way they are, that the happiness that NY  grants me being with my friends from there, are out of reach. I can't move back.

Dark as night,  
I speak not your name  
For you know who you are,  
And I know why you came.  


Hidden in my cave,  
Closed in by the depth of these walls.  
Yes I can hear you   
And all of the mean names that you call.  
But I swear to god  


You wont see me fall.   


So I strap on my armor,   
And I grab my weapon.

67,"For many different aspects of my life, my (23f) perspective keeps changing. I’m losing my mind. For example, my job, my relationship, my family, my friends, etc. I am also in a constant battle with depression. Sometimes I’m able to start to feel better for a few days... just for it to start again and the days just keep coming and the past turns into a blur.

I feel happy, then miserable. I am also very codependent in my relationships because it’s even harder to be happier otherwise. I am constantly looking for things wrong with my boyfriend, and he has never done anything to warrant that. (My past (2) boyfriends were pretty horrible, so that could be why (cheating, constant lying, stealing from me, putting me down, etc.)).

I feel crazy in my relationship. I want to be normal and be able to give him space. I can’t help but message him on multiple platforms everyday throughout the day.

Also, I’m not sure how to feel normal in my relationship with myself. I don’t have any true passions and it’s so hard to want what I know out of life. I feel so turbulent. Any advice?

TL;DR - I feel depressed and crazy. I’m codependent and need some help gaining some stability in my life.",24Feb2020,1

69,"The world is moving forwards everyone I know are becoming better people and more mature. And I just feel like I don't belong anymore. I never had these feeling up.until both of my parents died. And that's because I've bottled up a great portion of my emotions. Due to a large list of reasons that I will detail below.

I was a introvert and as such I didn't really grow up with any irl friends. I had almost none. And when I turned 11 I downloaded a wacky app called amino that I didn't know at this point would change my life and open my eyes to so many unique and interesting people.

You have to understand my views on the world when I was 11-12 were amazingly different than what they are now. I was exposed a large upon. I was a very isolated and neglacted child with a few siblings that really don't understand me at all.

I grew up consuming what I like to call 'Fandom' media.  And such I downloaded amino I was introduced to so many fandoms which include. Five nights at Freddys. &amp; creepypasta  for the early stages of my amino days. Until I deleted the app after fear of privacy. 

And I only picked it up a year later. And joined a lot of aminos such as Little nightmares camp camp &amp; fnaf. Amino was my first real introduction to the online social landscape. 

Well. That's not true. Miiverse was technically my first. And that is what led me to amino after it shut down.

Now you might be wondering where am I going with this? Where is this leading? Well. This path soon leads to me discovering how truly dreary my situations are. I learnt so much from my time on amino. And I changed a ton. 

My views changed. And how I perceived the world changed. I was a bit selfish at this time. wondering why couldn't I be like everyone else? Why can't I live a normal life? Why can't I have real friends? This led to great depressions that I really let out in a super bad way. I went out of my way to make people uncomfortable for no reason at all just because it gave me joy. And. When I got banned for doing this. I took a small break from it. And near this time a new Netflix series was released.

A series of unfortunate events.  I binged this show like mad. And looked up on amino if it had a fandom.

And.

It did.

This was where I became a better person and an individual. 
I was exposed to many great and incredible people. Who truly cared about everyone in that small community of about 600 members. 

Something just clicked to me here. That really didn't before. I quickly became loved.there. And.  Becoming a bit of one of the 'Mains' there. And I felt really special. I felt something I really didn't feel before. The feeling of being wanted. 

The feeling of being loved.

And I went out of my way to do things that I knew would make them appraise me more. I didn't even risk anything. I just tried my best to be the person I really wasn't. 

And then. I took a big break. 

And during that break. I began to reflect. Reflect on who I am. Reflect on everything I was doing. And I just felt really bad. For everyone I made uncomfortable in the past. And that I had to wear a mask. 

I just felt like the worst person in the world for what I had to do. I returned and continued my antics. But I was being more 'Me' and really. They didn't seem to mind it.

Now. I joined another amino in I believe December 2018 that also impacted me big time. And what happened here? Well. I was helping people. And helping people made me feel incredibly special. I just felt a feeling that I couldn't possibly explain.

I was defending the community from trolls, and helping its members deal with there struggles instead of explaining my own.

Now. Why didn't I explain my own struggles? Well, it's because I didn't want to rub in my own sadness onto other people. I didn't want to feel like a burden. And I bottled these all up. I bottled up all my own struggles and released them all into poems. And it was a valid method for a while.

Until the day.

The day where both of my parents died. 
When I heard the news I was experiencing a feeling I like to describe as.
 ""Acting tough when you really aren't to protect yourself."" I knew sadness was coming . Great immenses of sadness and frustrations. 

I was scared of feeling these feelings because I was so used to just bottling them up. Up onto the point where I could barely feel anything anymore. Now you need to understand. I really didn't have any irl friends all of them being online.

And I didn't express any of my negative feelings online at all. I didn't know how to express sadness at all. And I was scared to try. 

So. That's why I began explaining most of my frustrations and struggles here. Because if I don't. I know it will defiantly do more harm to me in the near future. And my parents would have wanted me to become a great person. That they never got to become. 

I owe a lot to my parents that I never gave them for when they were still alive. 

And I am determined to make them proud. Because I really didn't get to while they were alive

Our time on this world is limited. But that doesn't mean your potential is limited. 

I've just been trying to live a life that I myself will be happy with. I always put my online friends feelings above my own. But I am trying to stop that. And give me more of what I want. 

I might have been insane. Might have been crazy. But a certain string of events lead me to where I am in life. And life would be pretty bland if you knew what was coming around every corner. 

I don't think my life is bad or awful. It might not be the best.  But it is defiantly worth living. 
And that is enough for me. I might be slightly broken. But I defiantly am trying to repair myself. And experience more of what life has to offer.

Detailing my emotions and stuff aren't really easy for me. But I hope you understand what I am talking about. And I might be repeating some of the stuff I said in my previous post and if I am oops.

72,"So in my last post here I talked about some things I learned after my very first therapy appointment and because of the replies I want to give an update. 

I’ve been seeing a therapist for about two months now on a weekly basis. So far I have learned SO much about my past. When I finally laid out my past family life growing up to my therapist, I realized something that I had tucked away in the back of my mind for years now...I was emotionally and physically abused by my mom and my step dad throughout my childhood and I have been projecting those tucked away feelings onto prior relationships and significant others. 

It also explains why I am the type of person who is clingy, needy, and blames myself entirely when a relationship or friendship falls though...

But with the help of my therapist I have been working on managing these feelings, and finding healthy coping mechanisms to combat them. Not only that but I have learned SO much about my past relationships and why I still feel the need to reconnect and fix things with past lovers and apologize for things that were not my fault. 

But to end on an awesome note! With the new found confidence I have attained from therapy and all the exercises my therapist has taught me, my life has pulled a complete 180! The band I was manager/promoter of made me lead singer and not only do we have 10 shows scheduled for the summer, but we will be recording our first LP soon and I’ll be the singer on most of the songs! I’ve started a new, higher paying job in the career field I’ve always wanted, AND I’ve gained a couple new VERY awesome friends both IRL and online that have been my safety net when I have my bad mental health days. 

So in conclusion, there IS a light at the end of the tunnel, things really WILL get better. Wether it requires therapy, medication, meditation, herbs, exercises, or plain old grit and perseverance.  IT WILL GET BETTER...

There’s a lot of things in store for you that this world has to offer, ya just have to be strong enough to see it through. Thank you r/mentalhealth for helping me see that. :)

i'm 15, but please don't believe that makes me unimportant. i've been diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression and have attempted suicide in the past.

as the title says, i'm having constant violent fantasies. i try not to think about it, but it always comes back. sometimes it feels kind of suffocating, i have to stop what i'm doing and breathe. it's like voices are telling me to murder and showing me what it would look like, but there's no voices and it's just my thoughts and i'm just thinking about it in my head and not actually seeing it.

my most common fantasies are burning down houses or trees/forests and school shootings.

i am not going to act on these. i DO NOT under any circumstance want to commit arson or murder. but it always just comes to me again, and i start thinking of how it would feel to do it. i try REALLY hard not to think about it, but i can't. it just keeps getting stronger.

before this started, i wanted to run away. now though, i know i am a danger by thinking these thoughts and if i were free to live on my own no one would stop me. i fully believe that the only way to stop this is by killing myself.

i have stayed free of self harm for 1 week easy enough but now it's all i want to do. i can't fucking take it right now, it feels like my head is going to explode.

my dad keeps cancelling my therapist appointments. i'm off my meds, but this violence ideation started whilst i was on a dose. i do know that getting off my meds is probably what caused this all to get so worse.

I did tell the internship coordinator at work while I was mid-panic attack that I had a lot going on personally and I didn’t feel right being at work (i said it better than that but it had the same idea!).

i know that i could get out of this funk if i worked hard and actually made an effort, but it's easier to just cruise through life drunk high or stoned and try to distract myself from having to put in an effort and be uncomfortable.

I feel like such a burden to anyone I’m around. I hate myself and it’s just too easy to focus on what I dislike than what I like about me, which isn’t much. 

The self harm hasn’t been great and I’ve just been doing stuff that isn’t outwardly noticeable because that’s not the kind of attention I want. But night time is always the worse. I just cycle through trauma and sad memories and just more evidence that I shouldn’t be here. I know I sound so pathetic and I am. But I don’t know what to do. 

I am in therapy fyi which helps in someways I guess. I’m not on any meds as I just don’t like them and all of them mess with my sleep.

I’m not brave enough to kill myself so no worries there but the pain is just too much. All I do is think about ways to kill myself in a way where maybe my family will think I just ran away or ran off with the some guy because they’re all that’s really stopping me. But they hate me too. 

I live with my grandma who’s sick and anytime I go to my parents house they seem so annoyed to see me. Sometimes they’re okay but mostly they just seem to think it better if I’m not there. My mom just says I’m too much Alot and I know she’s right. My younger brother hates me and doesn’t care how I am tho I hope he’s well. 

The more I type this out the more I think I should just do it. I’ve been stock piling meds to use if I wanted an out but it still scares me. I don’t wanna vegetate myself I just want to die even if nothing comes after. I just feel like such a waste.

I just wish I could turn off this fear and just swallow the pills I have. I even have some nausea pills to try and keep everything down long enough to work. I just didn’t think life would be like this when I was younger. I thought it would be better. I didn’t think I’d only be good as a sex object or be assaulted and recorded when I was 14. I didn’t think I’d always be this little bitch just feeling bad for himself. I really thought it would just be better but I didn’t deal with any of the bullying or the trauma when it was happening and now that’s it’s all caught up to me I just think it’s too late.

I am a 19 year old male. I have lived my whole life very grateful and I still am to this very day. I have had everything I could every ask for and will never complain about the fortune I have had. 

But recently I just entered college and I am heading into my second semester. Previously I broke up with my girlfriend before the first semester started and sadly got back together w her over winter break. I recently found out she moved on which crushed me. However there is still this girl I really like in college and I recently found out we will never be a thing by having the talk with her about our future.

Along with this going on my roommate who I considered one of my best friends now has a girlfriend and is slowly cutting me out. All my previous friends at college are no longer talking to me as much and I am having huge problems finding people to relate with. And that’s something I’ve never had problems with before. I have always been know to be a social guy yet recently I have never felt more alone.

I keep getting this feeling that I was just lucky before high school w my friend group because I was friends w them for 10+ years. I have never felt more alone in my entire life and I don’t know what to do with myself. I had been thinking terrible thoughts and haven’t been able to sleep. Recently I feel like people don’t care about me and I just don’t matter. Every girl I talk to doesnt give the time of day and every dude I talk to doesn’t really want to be my friend. I have always considered myself an optimistic person but these last couple weeks I see nothing but a bad future.

87,"Sometimes I get into a state that feels very unlike me, and if anyone who knows me is a witness to it, they get really worried. Which always seems odd to me, because I'm completely calm. I wouldn't call it an ""emotional state"". More like an ""emotionless state"". There are emotions leading up to it. This time it was sadness (that's the closest word but it doesn't seem right). I can't remember if anger or other negative emotions have led to it. 

My face feels like a mask hanging from my head. If I'm speaking to someone, my tone comes out flat. If I'm alone, even my inner monologue takes on a flat affect. I'll sit very still or move more slowly and deliberately than usual. I'll feel even more disconnected from my body than usual. 

But my thoughts are clear, objective, so logical as to be divorced from emotion. When I'm in this state I can see patterns and make connections that might usually elude me because I have such strong emotions. I feel as if I can untangle the mess that is human interaction, I can see a sequence of cause and effect like a row of dominoes leading up to the very moment before this state of mind comes over me. 

Even though I know this is out of the ordinary for me (of course I do, this objectivity even extends to looking critically at myself with no bias, negative or positive), it doesn't worry me. If I feel anything at all during this state, it's either slight puzzlement at what may have caused it, or... something I can hardly describe. A sort of serene confidence that borders on a spiritual experience. As though disconnecting from my body and emotions is allowing me to connect with something higher than that. But if I ever consciously think about that, I usually dismiss it because it's not logical enough. I could only come up with these words by intentionally trying to reconnect with emotions. It doesn't feel like I'm having any, but if I really dig deep for them, that's what I come up with. 

People who see me when I'm like this describe it as cold, or sometimes sad. I asked the only person who has seen it more than once what other words they might use, and they came up with ""stoic"". One time they said I was ""cold and calculated."" 

Is this dissociation or something else? I'm diagnosed with major depression, generalized anxiety, dependent personality disorder, and avoidant personality disorder. I suffered from mild PTSD after an emotionally abusive relationship I escaped from almost 2 years ago but I'm mostly asymptomatic now.

I feel like my entire life has just fallen apart and all I want to do is fix our family, but it seems she is done with me and our marriage is over. I really dont know how I'm going to keep going. My new medication has been helping somewhat as my suicidal thoughts have been less frequent, but with losing my baby boy and the love of my life and emotional rock is tearing me up inside. 

They were my whole life and this fucking disease and my inability to overcome it has finally did me in. Without my family I feel I've lost whatever hope I had of things getting better. I just want them back and don't want to lose then for good. I just feel it's too late.",24Feb2020,1
90,"Hello, I deal with what I thought is a bad habit, but now I kinda doubt it(?)
I'm in my early 20s and since I was something like 13, 14 I have been always picking on my skin. When I started I have been having lots of zits, whiteheads, but now my skin issues come only from picking, with small exceptions. As I'm writing it, I reminded myself of one time I dig this bloody hole on my forehead just to get one little natural, oil filament at age of 12, so I'm not sure when it started. 
Every evening I lock myself in the bathroom and look for something 'suspiciously looking' on my face and breasts. I used to do it on my arms and stomach too, but don't know why, now I'm somehow scared to, as if these places were too fragile. 
I stretch my skin looking for anything odd, and if I find anything I pick. Sometimes I pick a few things, sometimes I spend 1,5 hour in front of the mirror. I even pick on little hairs likely to pop out on my chest, armpits, bikini area, legs. It doesn't get bloody often anymore now that I live with my SO, but I keep on picking. 
I watch these 'blackheads extraction' videos a lot and for some reason I squeeze my jaw really tightly to the point that it hurts and I still feel it after. In fact, as I was writing that I began to feel this. I don't even squeeze my teeth, it's as if I stressed my jaw. 
After picking on myself I always obviously feel regret. And yet I keep on doing that, it somehow satifies me even though I keep in my mind it's wrong and I will feel bad, if I don't already. 
I don't know what else is meaning in this case, so I don't know what else should I write. Does it look like anything?",24Feb2020,1
91,"I have always been diagnosed with depression and anxiety.   


I recently made the horrendous decision of flat out committing identity theft to my own partner. I ruined his credit, maxed out credit cards, and tried to fix it on my own (which didn't happen).  


His friends and family (who are mostly extremely intelligent and educated) have told him that I am likely a psycopath or sociopath because of this and many other things. 

\- I have dealt with rage most of my life (though have made vast improvements in the last year and a half since going on antidepressant medication)

\- I have been impulsive in spending, acting, speaking

\- I have been aggressive

\- I would describe myself as charming (although I genuinely enjoy positive human interaction)  


I'm perplexed. Everything I am reading seems to be pointing to the fact that I do have antisocial personality disorder... but what about the depression?  


\- I do and am able to feel remorse

\- I feel love and loss

\- I'm empathetic to others feelings (although I have made impulsive and reckless decisions without thinking about how they effect others)

92,"Long story short I hate myself and I don’t know why, I’ve tried to stop having such a low self esteem, but I can’t seem to shake the feeling that the world (and my family) would be better off without me; I’m not going to commit suicide, I don’t want to make my family sad, but I want to stop existing, I have death thought all the time. 
I’ve started working, not because of the money but because I didn’t have anything else to do, I lost all my friends (I moved and no one seemed to even notice I was gone for a couple of months) and although I’m studying something that I like, this situation of only waking up to go to work/study is killing me on the inside.

93," Sorry in advance for the rant.
Recently I was visiting my parents and suffered from a stress-induced anxiety attack. 
My mom made me swear to restart therapy after that incident. 
However I am really reluctant to do so because I've had two bad experiences with therapists in the past. The first one got fixed on that idea that my parents' break up (I was a teen at that time) caused my OCD/anxiety problems and only wanted to work on that. Even though I told him that this probably (also) had other reasons I'd like to address, but he completely shut me down everytime I brought these up. 
The second one was even worse: She asked almost the exact same questions for five consequetive sessions (literally none of those directly related to my illness, just personal stuff) because appearently she had both a bad memory and  no note-taking skills. Furthermore she always wanted to pin everything down on my friends and talked about how they are bad for me all while have next to no info about them. They also didn't provide me with any practical tips or coping strategies and I felt super uncomfortable during all of the sessions.
However, my mother hinted at how much of a burden I sometimes am to her because of my mentall illness and I feel really bad about this and would like to do smth about it. On the other hand I know, that she probably imagines therapy to be a quick cure for everything which is just plain wrong. Would it maybe be better to juast cut off ties altogether as to not put a burden on my parents? Or are there any alternatives for dealing with anxiety/ocd that do not envolve therapy?
For those who are currently in therapy: How much does is really help you in dealing with your mental illness?

P.S.: I'd also like to add that overall my situation has improved greatly since my teens from getting anxiety attacks almost every week to only having them a few times a year, but I'm sure as hell am not “normal“ and I probably never will be but somehow my mother seems to expect me to get “cured“ and for my mental illness to stop altogether even tough this is almost impossibly especially with the ocd ...",24Feb2020,1
94,"Around last year, I started having real anxiety troubles related to a specific phobia. Over time whilst waiting for therapy, I’d picked up a whole host of safety behaviours trying to negate the anxiety of this phobia. Now I am receiving treatment, the phobia still (less intensely) persists but I seem to have moved to a more generalised OCD (from what both me and my psychologist can tell).

So I was just wondering, can certain mental health issues merge into other ones? Or were both issues already existing but the levels of intensity and prominence change?",24Feb2020,1

but I don’t acknowledge that i’m talking to myself when it starts, i see myself in two scenarios, i’m either on Jimmy fallon addressing Jimmy and the audience, or i’m in a therapist’s office(haven’t been to one yet) 

when i realize that i’m just talking to myself, i acknowledge myself, belittle myself, and then keep going

i have this fear of abandonment, or that people don’t really like me. I was even scared to post on this subreddit due to what some of you might think of me. even though i have this fear of abandonment, i distance myself from the people i love most, because i don’t want them to think i’m annoying 

the worst part are the mood swings, i could be on the verge of crying due to me telling a joke my friends didn’t think was funny, and then perfectly fine 15 minutes later

I don’t want to tell my mom about any specific conditions i’ve seen symptoms for, because then i feel like i’m faking it for sympathy

i wonder why i think about that, because the only person i’ve told about this is my mom, and i only told her about the mood swings(she says it’s probably hormone)

96,"So for the last year I've been feeling really depressed. However, about every 3 weeks I feel fine for about a week, just a bit emotionally numb but I don't feel the eternal sadness like I would normally feel. I'm asking because about 6 months ago I hit my lowest point i.e. I had serious suicidal thoughts and was so emotionally numb that I turned to self harm and alcohol to just feel something, I'm scared that I'll fall into the same hole later this year since I'm starting junior college (I live in Iceland, different school system).

That's the question, you don't have to read any further. Just personal stuff now!:

Once I started going down, I just gradually kept going down over time, and I've never gotten anywhere near back to my ""normal"" mental state, say 7 or 8 years ago. I think my Anxiety has improved a lot over the past few years, but depression, negativity, and hopelessness just get worse as time goes on it seems. I don't think I'll ever get out of this hole. My life is not even bad, I'm a really lucky guy, but the depression just keeps building and taking me further down and I get more and more reclusive, not just from people, but from activities I used to enjoy. I don't know how to get better. I've done everything I can to try to fight it, including trying so many different medications, doing talk therapy, exercising, dieting, meditation, other ""experimental"" treatments, but I still keep gradually getting worse, it seems. I've still got a few things I want to try, but changing your outlook on life seems extremely difficult.

Thanks for reading, I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the matter.",24Feb2020,1
98,"So idk where to start. This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. Guess I’ll start with everything leading up to why I’m making this post. I’m 18, almost 19 years old. Diagnosed with Extreme Generalized Anxiety Disorder when I was 16. Never had an “abusive” childhood but my parents often resorted to spankings and sometimes straight up just slapping me everywhere except the face as forms of discipline, albeit not hard
Enough to actually leave a mark (as far as I can remember, idk how true that is tho). My mother often resorted to screaming and slamming doors when me or one of my younger siblings would upset her. I wasn’t hit as hard as my siblings were, god bless them. Anyway, for three years of my childhood, my dad was absent almost completely from my life for busisness, trying to provide for me and my mother and siblings, he rarely ever used hitting as a form as discipline, instead used words. Again, never full blown abuse, but definitely much harsher than it should have been. He’s also manipulative now that I’m an adult and moved out, tries to call my gf of two years manipulative. He was also an alcoholic but quit when I was around 15, cold turkey. Now has a beer every once in a while. Now that you know my past. When I turned about 17, I got heavily into bodybuilding and powerlifting, and the gym was my therapy, it became my addiction, and solved a lot of my anxiety and depression problems (I also have a past with self harm). It made me more confident, level headed, happier with the world. Fast forward a year later, now me and my girl live on our own, we have two dogs and two cats. Just now, one of the cats went off and scratched and hissed  atour new puppy, and I went into a fit of rage and grabbed the cat and literally choked it out until it was almost unconscious and threw it outside on the porch. I also did this to our new puppy (after shitting everywhere in our house) , not nearly to the same extent  I also have a history with loving flicking lighters, and fire. Am I turning into a serial killer? I also have anger issues, not nearly as bad as before working out but still there. I literally love these animals, and this is something I wish to discontinue and I want to get help for. I know I’m violent and it scares
of what I could become If I don’t control it. So I’m reaching out asking for help.",24Feb2020,1

My mental health has been getting worse lately and I am supposed to start therapy again in a month or so, but I only have 1 year to do it since my mother does not want to pay and I can only go to this place until a certain age, which I will reach in 1 year.

100,"We talked for one session, and after he asked me if I wanted to do an assessment to help with my completely failing mental health, after which a bunch of tests will be done to see what else should we do.

As I’m still a minor, they have to get consent from my parents. Early on I said to him that my parents don’t know about my *depression, and I’m too scared to tell them about it. But god, if I really want to get better, they eventually have to know. So I said yes.

So, he’ll schedule an assessment for me at our school’s psychological services, but it does take around 3 weeks to process. During that time my parents will be informed, and we’ll just see what happens from there.

I’m so fucking scared, to be honest. Being so open about my emotions and thoughts in a professional setting terrifies me. Knowing that my family will have to know what I’m going through scares me even more.

But truth is, shit really isn’t gonna get any better unless I actively acknowledge that I do need help, and find ways to get better.

In less than a month from today my mom, who has been in and out of jail for 4 years is coming home. My mom is a heroin addict. She is untrustworthy, undependable, selfish, hotheaded, distant, and judgmental. However, I still want her to get better. Even though shes all these things, she is still a beautiful woman, and I chose to believe, at least for the moment that she loves me, but not more than she loves herself. I talk to her on the phone and we don't say much other than

""hi""

""how are you?""

""What are you doing?""

""Have a good week!""

and

""I love you..""

My grandma and I still believe she's in love with my dad, who has also been overtaken by disease, (hes a schizophrenic bipolar, and is now homeless). I still cry when I think about him and how he will probably never be in the picture even though he used to be a wonderful man. My mom became addicted after she chose to leave him during a pyschcotic episode when he was off his meds. (at least thats what I was told.) and hasn't been well since. Growing up, after my brothers were born I always felt like a second class citizen in my mom's eyes, I would spend my time as a kid riding my bike around the neighborhood and make friends with any kid outside, I would avoid home for as long as possible, because my mom and grandma were probably there fighting about pain killers, or drug money. Even though as a kid I was very extroverted outside of school, kids would constantly take advantage of me, making me do things I didn't want to do, ranging from cursing to kissing to sexual things.. I would do them because I felt as though if i disappointed anyone in anyway they wouldn't want to be my friend anymore, which definitely came from my mom. I still feel this way, even though I know it probably isn't valid.. I haven't had many, but I've ruined almost every relationship i've been in because I don't have enough self worth.

 I think I've blocked most of my childhood out of my head from age 7 and under, so most of those memories are from when my moms addiction was at its worst. I have a vivid memory of my mom slamming my grandma against the wall, pulling her hair and punching after, after she tried to stand up to my mom, another of my mom punching a hole in the wall, after my grandma refused to let her borrow her car, and another of waking up to my mom screaming while i was sleeping on my couch, and when police entered the home, i soon found out my baby sister, Chloe, who was around 4-7 months had passed away. My mom buy my brothers and I lots of pointless toys and electronics (probably to compensate). When she was home my mom sometimes seemed to really care, which makes me think she did love me after all, but how could someone who loves me do the things she did?

When I was in 4th grade my grandma had had enough and called CPS on my mom, and my brothers and I went to live with my grandparents and my mom went somewhere (I'm not sure where exactly) but in the summer between 5th and 6th grade I found out my grandma had also turned to drugs and overdosed. (She had already been on prescription pain killers, but started doing harder drugs) she's clean now, but not around much because shes taking care of her mom. I went to live with my friend who i had been having a sleepover with (I will never regret a sleepover more in my life) and my brothers and I were separated. At the time I had anger issues and got into physical fights with my foster sister, which never got too serious, but my foster parents threatened to kick me out at least once a month and I wished they did, because I hated living there. They would often tell me the reason I lived there was because they were the only ones that cared about me and my own family didn't love me, and that I should be ashamed I have middle eastern family, because they're terrorists, and how ungrateful I was. I was also forced into therapy at this time, which i also hated because it was stigmatized and I didn't think I needed to go. All of this furthered my extremely low self worth and I started cutting around 6th grade, and took a visit to the pysch ward when I threatened to kill myself, but they decided I wasn't at risk, which I did a lot of lieing to get myself out of.  My most vivid memory of my foster home experience was when my friend and i walked a mile to krogers in negative degrees, convinced ourselves we were gonna die, and my foster parents refused to pick us up, and instead grounded me and decided to go to an indoor amusement park (My friend and I laugh about this today, though). 

..

About a month ago I was in the pysch ward to prevent myself from commiting suicide, which has been the lowest point in my life so far. It hasn't gotten much easier. I'm getting help though, and im on antidepressants, and im soon going back to therapy. I hope that when my mom comes home she's more dependable and I'll finally be able to have a healthy relationship with at least one of my parents, which brings me back to the originally point of this post, my mom and I have basically never built a real relationship since i was 8, she doesn't know me, we are basically strangers. How do I build a relationship with her, and cope with this situation at the same time, and she isn't rehabilitated, how do I cope with that again?

But for the first time in a year and a half, I felt heavily compelled to commit suicide.

I’ve had a long battle with general and mental health.
My career and dreams went into the toilet when I was diagnosed at 16 with 2 brain tumours #winningthelottery.

I have always been typically able to handle my shit plus I have a shrink to book an appointment whenever I typically need.

But around Tuesday I felt compelled to end it.
I told others cause I’ve heard that that’s sign of wanting help and also cause my best mate can read me like a map. Moment he saw me he inquired.

I don’t want to end it, first off, second if I failed.. there’s A LOT of people who come and beat the shit out of me (gently) for even attempting such a thing.

The feeling has lingered and been siting on my shoulders so to speak since then and I was better after that day as well.
Not perfect but better.

I have a very disturbed sense of humour. Most likely cause of my messed up past I laugh to ease the effect of my tumour, idk.

I just feel inadequate all the time, I feel unloved by my family I don’t really have any friends, more like co workers. My only friend is a reddit friend who I sometimes talk to. I feel trapped and while I do have drive to better myself sometimes I feel helpless. Like I just want to curl up and not do anything for a while. I’d like to just disappear and start over somewhere new. Honestly it all comes back to how alone I feel, I am lonely and nobody knows this because nobody really cares to ask me. I’ve never had a relationship and honestly this just makes me think im unlovable. I crave physical and emotional love and I don’t even how to go about getting it. I don’t always feel like this, it comes and goes and I honestly don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’d like to go and talk to a professional but I have no insurance and I can’t really spare money to pay out of pocket. 

I don’t know if I need help or if I’m going through a mid life crisis at 26 or what is happening. Yes my job is very stressful and I want to cry everyday but I can’t really leave it. Is my job doing this to me ? Or am I depressed?

It's like there's a a disconnect somewhere in my brain and that if someone could just rewire it, everything would be ""fixed"". I feel a sense of dissasociation, as if things don't really matter in the end. I get frustrated because I know how I should feel and how I want to feel but it's like im just not capable of doing that. 

It's like everything that happens in life just doesn't really bother me, things might affect me, but after the initial impact, it just doesn't matter. For a lot of things in my life I wouldn't have cared whether they happened or not.

I don't miss people, I might enjoy their company when I'm with them, but I never yearn to be with them again. I can appreciate the people they are and what they do for me, but I'm never able to express that appreciation, and it doesn't make me miss them.

There's alot more stuff that's just hard to put my finger on, it's hard to figure out exactly *how* you think and why you think that way.

114,"Hi,

Because of depression and other issues, I had to come back live my mother 3 years ago. I then started seeing a therapist to make progress on myself and get better.

The same year, my older brother came back at home because of health issues and we've been the 3 of us since. My brother always had anger issues, if something doesn't get his way, he shouts angrily, you can feel his emotion in the whole house (at least I can, my mother is half deaf so she doesn't hear him). It was already the case around 20 years ago (I was 15 and him 18), and at that time I think it rooted some trauma in me, because he could be very intense, sometimes breaking stuff, getting in big arguments with my dad, or threatening to break my stuff if I told the parents about the fact that he just broke stuff in my room because we were playing video games and he got angry.

I had my own issues at that time, but that literally broke me, every time he got angry I was paralyzed and had to absorb everything, even when not directed at me and in different rooms.

Years went by, he got a job and moved away, and coincidentally, I felt better. I still got my own issues but at least I could focus on myself better.

Since we've both been back, there has been ups and downs, he still got his anger some times, but it was manageable and I was not as much triggered. Except some times when I felt weaker, and it instantly hit me. He could be angry at cats because they're loud, about his computer, or anything else, and I feel it, I feel an anger that's not mine, and I really don't need it.

He doesn't realize how it can affect others. I'm always afraid to talk to him about it, and it seems I am right to be. I did today, because it's been two months of daily disturbances, he told me we had nothing to talk about, he felt totally in his rights. I had to evacuate my anger so I went in another room and had to punch a wall. He then came to me and tried to beat me. RIGHT. PUNCHING ME is his solution.

It's not the first time. Last year I had big health issues, I have restless legs syndrome, and none of the usual treatments were working anymore. I felt like I was gonna spend my life suffering, so I got a little agitated at night, I had to shout. It woke him, so he came to my room all angry telling me I wasn't alone in the house. WHAT. A. JOKE. So I felt trap by my health, and trapped by the situation, It only made everything worse, I didn't know what to do I was in so much pain (emotional and physical), it had to go away I broke my bed, hit the wall with my head. His reaction ? wanting to punch me...

My mom had to call an ambulance and I went to the hospital to calm down. It's not isolated, but it was the worst of the past years.

I had a mental breakdown again this week and had to be taken to the ER again.

I have to go to therapy to deal with people who don't. He has issues, but will never admit it, it's normal to him.

I don't know what to do anymore, every day in a new huge struggle.

I can't move away because I'm poor, I have to job because I can't feel good enough to get one. He won't move away either because he's dealing with health issues first.

I will totally collapse and break down for good if it keeps going on this way.",24Feb2020,1
115,"     I’m not really sure if this is the right place to share this, and this is my first post ever so please bear with me. I (18F) have really been struggling with a lot of things recently. I’m a senior in HS and I go to the most rigorous and difficult program in my school county, so I’m taking all AP and college courses, which is a lot of work in and out of the classroom. On top of that, I have a job at my local library where I work 20-25 hours a week (which doesn’t seem like a lot but on top of school it is). This combination means I have almost 0 free time. Every day I go to school then straight to work and then home to do all of my homework and sleep. On weekends I work all day Saturday and do homework Saturday night and by Sunday I genuinely can’t bring myself to get out of bed because I’m physically and emotionally exhausted. 
     Lately I’ve been struggling to do my homework and I find it really hard to focus at school and my job, which has resulted in me falling behind. I know this is a bad thing and I want it to stop, but I cannot get motivated to do any of my work. I cant enjoy my hobbies because I don’t have anywhere to make time for them, and when I do have time I cant seem to enjoy them as much as I used to. 
     I do go to a therapist and I have told her about my feelings, but she couldn’t really give me any guidance given that her suggestion was a mental health day where I skip school, which I cant do due to my schoolwork. I also talked to my mom but she wasn’t very understanding and basically told me I was lazy and I have senioritis. I have been counting down the days until I get a break from school, but it’s over a month away and I’m scared that I won’t be able to make it until then. I really can’t risk having my grades fall right now either, which is why I’m so worried. 
Are there any suggestions for me to stop feeling this way and regain some of my motivation?",24Feb2020,1
116,"Been struggling with this all of my life, but it has become much worse in recent years and is impeding my career/development. 

I can sometimes see a solution clear as day, but when I go through the steps to implement it, or describe it, I completely lose the ability to follow through. It doesn't feel physically painful, but every step feels mentally agonizing to perform and I can't concentrate on it. 

Concrete example:  Matrix multiplication. I know the operation, but if asked to put it all together and iterate through all rows/columns for both matrices, I feel like I am completely unable to repeat the dot product operation without losing track of which dimension I am iterating over (rows from left, or columns from right). 

Not sure if related but I seem to forget conventions that should come naturally, e.g. parts of formal mathematical definitions. 

When I am under stress this is grossly exacerbated and I am find myself unable even to go through trivial operations like above, or even use induction arguments, because it involves defining something I implicitly calculate in my head.

119,"I hardly ever miss work, but when I do, even for a legitimate reason such as the flu, I feel guilty. It took so much courage for me to call in today. Usually my work pries and asks why you're not coming in which they're not even supposed to do. I don't want them to think I'm lying about being sick so I feel like I need to explain myself. Some workplaces can treat you so awful if you struggle with your mental health. The last job I had denied me a position because of mine. Even though that's illegal they got away with it.

One of my bosses didn't even ask questions when I called.
""Hi. I need to take a mental health day.""
""Okay, I'll let the team know you won't be in today. Feel better.""
I was pretty surprised. Usually they ask so many questions like they're trying to make you feel guilty.

120,"Hi There

I am in a bit of a pickle right now and just looking for some input or support. I am 33(M) and having a severe low point right now due to relationship issues. 

I want to say first that my issues really do not seem to me to be that bad in the grand scheme of things, but because of my mental health issues the stuff going on right now has brought me back down as low as I ever have been.

I grew up with an extremely mentally ill father who had severe OCD. His father was a veteran and clearly had his own issues, and ended up eventually killing himself, but not before sexually abusing my father and ruining his life. My father was a wonderful man and I loved him very much but eventually he went into a severe psychosis when I was a child and my home life went into a hyper-turbulent state with ambulances and suicide attempts and traumatic events happening regularly. 

I eventually developed what I believe is inherited OCD, combined with PTSD, which has plagued me my entire adult life. Nevertheless I have been successful in my career and social life and am very happy with it, and am grateful that while my symptoms are severe, they never removed my ability to function for the most part, as they did with my father. 

In any case I have been in a relationship with a woman for 5 years and she is my best friend, but it is not working out. We have a very strong emotional attachment, but we are rife with incompatibilities. She wants 3 kids, I want 1 (and even then I am petrified of giving my child my condition). We've never bought a house because we can't agree on an area to settle in. I'm an introvert and love quiet time and she is an extrovert because she loves doing stuff all the time and feels abandoned when I need to be alone. The sex has basically become non-existent and I'm sexually frustrated all the time. 

The end feels nigh and we have confronted breaking up many times. But at the same time I am petrified of letting go. I love her dearly and am constantly afraid I am making a huge mistake all because of my inability to fully heal and learn how to love someone unconditionally. I am also equally scared I am ruining her life and slowing down her ability to find someone who can fulfill her needs and have three children and live a normal life. She is only 27 and still has time to leave me and find someone else but she often goes into bouts of depression thinking there's no time left. 

She is not without her own baggage and insecurities and she knows it is a two way street and we both contribute to the state of our relationship, but because of the guilt that I always impose on myself I am feeling like I am committing a crime by either leaving or staying and I am in a constant state of misery and it's killing me. 

The guilt also of ending another relationship at my age and the failure of not getting married and having kids like all of my peers is just another layer on top of the soup of crippling guilt.

Long story short -- grateful for what I have and what I've overcome mentally, but relationship bringing me back down to my knees in pain, in a way I haven't felt since I was in the thick of it as a child. Not sure what to do anymore.",24Feb2020,1
121,"I have been suffering from depression for 7 years now and my temper started rising through each year. I'd almost murder a dog and mutilate it's limbs without having any sympathy. Each year something happened that got me depressed and other reasons keep colliding on eachothers until I felt empty by 2016. Depression made me lose focus, unshave my beard for more than a month. Depression also made me realise that people never grow up, even facially. When you look at a kid all he wants is a toy, then when he grows up he wants to get a girlfriend (No offence, he wants to fulfill his needs just like the toy). Depression even made me take some early life decisions like to cut all my ties with everyone I know for no specific reason, live unmarried, not taking a driving test or buy a car, refusing to study although I was very passionate to learn etc. I'm not suffering from any mental diseases or physical one's. If we are talking about long-term depression then it'd be since 2005, but it started forming by 2013 and it got more worse each year. I know it's not a place of discussion for such a matter but I wish I could speak to someone who at least could figure out a way to reduce from it.

125,"For the past few months, I’ve observed myself to have sudden outbursts of anger at work and complete lack of motivation. 

I saw a therapist last week and he suggested that I take the MMPI test. For the report from the test came out to be accurate, in the sense that I could say that the person in the report was me. 

All this while, I thought I was going through a crisis of sorts but the report just put in front of me things that I’ve largely denied. I’ve difficulty in admitting that most of it’s true and I’m not quite nice as I’ve portrayed myself to be. 

Anybody else has had similar experiences? I am seeing the therapist again tomorrow.

126,"When I was depressed

I felt lonely, suicidal, lack of purpose, tired and fatigue. I became depressed because for years events in my life are just not working out! 

You must look at depression as a state, in which you cannot go any lower. I view depression as a spiritual message from god that life is not working I need to evolve into a brand new person. Life is not working. Either I am too comfortable, or I am on the wrong path in life. Which was two reasons why I became depressed. I also became depressed due to my social anxiety. Realising anxiety was ruining my life. Not able to make strong friendships. Not being able to date. These two reasons are slightly less dramatic but are apart of the equation.

Bad grades at school, school bullies, doubt from family members and a verbally abusive father. My dad told me I will be worse than him. Surrounded by alcohol and him yelling at my mother.

Social anxiety and traumas from the past. One year later. Being apart of self imrpovement. I have bettered myself to an unbelievable level. My mentality is almost indestructable and can never be broken. I am confident and courageous. Currently learning how to Harness fear. I hit depression for the first time last february. I hit depression in August and September last year and evolved from it in many ways.

This month, guess what I hit depression. I hit it hard. Worse than last year. However, using similar tac tics I will evolve and once again become the strongest version of myself!

I hope this helps me out there struggling!

Thank you!",24Feb2020,1
127,"So when I was 16 my older brother got struck by an oncoming train late at night during a rain storm. Accident, i get it. At peace with that. 

So now I’m 16 going through 9th grade the beginning of high school dealing with all that drama, cool kids etc...  

At this point my family (mom &amp; dad plus 2 sisters) were devastated. I can’t tell you how much it literally fucking sucked. From the love and support for 3 days then the rest of the world moves on. 

So dealing with that, I was slowly starting ti realize I was gay. And i was so scared. Literally terrified. 

Now heres where i go to the dr and get Xanax for anxiety about the PTSD of losing my brother. But not only was i using it for that I was using to to numb my mind sooo much to not feel. I started abusing them. In HS i forget about 3 years of my life. Skip to college. 

Out on my own still not out as gay hiding it at all cost. Popping 6-8 2mgs a day. My best friends sit me down at a party and scream to stop. I did. For 3 days cold turkey until I had a seizure and almost died in the hospital. Keep in mind this post is from 16  to 19 years old. Im 26 now.

128,"I've started to forget things. At first it was maybe someone's birthday or the day of a party. That has evolved to the point I'll forget things after a few minutes, making conversations especially hard to hold. I've gone from hard hitting headaches to just constant pain/static in my head day in day out. I went from finding it hard to focus on subjects in class to not being able to think clearly at all. Any thoughts or decisions that I do have are unconscious. I went from feeling sad, to not feeling anything. From lazy to constantly unmotivated. From being able to sit alone for hours to going insane from my own voices in my head. I had a brain scan and it didn't show anything.

129,"With my lack of feeling emotions I can often feel detached from myself. And without motivation I don't do much for anything really. So I feel like an empty vessel in a way. But I can still control myself obviously and it often feels like I'm controlling this person from a computer, doing whatever I like not in the best interest of my character, but for my own entertainment. Of course I'll snap out of that mode after a few minutes, but what's worrisome is my ""play style"" I guess. When I'm in that mode I'm properly detached and feel as if there is no consequences. So instead of playing smart and evenly, I'd imagine trying to push the limits of anything really. Something like giving away all my money to some random guy, or befriending my entire town so I can walk through and say hey to everyone I see are fine. But on the other hand, murdering someone just for fun, raping some poor girl, torturing a person in my shed for years as they grow up is not so fine. Of course I don't think I'll go that far but what if one time I don't snap back to reality. Anyone else have a similar experience?",24Feb2020,1
131,"I've known my wife for going on 5 years now and we've been married for 6 months.  We have a very strong relationship and almost never argue. We communicate effectively and express our irritants before they become something bigger. My wife has anxiety and depression, which most of the time does not impact anything as it has been fairly minor. 

Recently however, we've had several big life stressors (buying a house, changes in both our employment, and a slew of other 'adulting' problems). With these life stressors, her depression has really revved up and she is often pushing me away when having these depressive episodes. I don't take it personally that she needs her space and I do everything I can think of to reassure her that I love her and always will. Lately it has been negativity impacting our relationship because when she's in a bad headspace, she tends to catastrophize pretty much everything. She has begun generalizing that our relationship is falling apart, our love isn't the same, and even our sex life failing. 

I have a background in psych and cog rehab so naturally I encourage her to talk to someone about her depression. Wether that be a therapist to process through emotions or a psychiatrist for meds to take the edge off. I've tired gradually reshaping her negative self talk over time, we've had sprees of exercising frequently, 'natural' seretonin supplements, and even worked on eating more healthy. (This may seem I'm being pushy because I'm spelling it outright - these attempts have been discussed fairly organically in conversation that we both agreed on) 

As it currently stands, she's completely resistant to seeking help because when she was younger she saw a therapist for a year and sees no benefit from it. (Childhood trauma as a teenager) I've even suggested both of us try marriage counseling to see if we can work through this together but she is not at all interested.

Right now I'm becoming frustrated and am feeling stuck as to how I can support her in improving her mental health. It's her decision at the end of the day and I don't know how else to approach the subject.

133,"Grade 11, Male. I've missed so many days because of my mental issues. Grades went from high A's down to D's to N/A. I've watched my education slowly get fucked for years because of my mental health. At the moment I can't even think, it's all unconscious typing, so what's the point? I'm so sick of being asked ""ArE yOu cOmInG tO sChOoL tOdAy"". No matter how many times I tell them I can't fucking control how I wake up they won't shut up. It's like they ridicule my health. I've thought about shooting that place up too, less for the students more for the teachers. I don't have a gun myself, but my friends do and my mum's bf does too. I could easily do it, and it might be worth it too. All the teachers there don't give a shit about their students. They just want their school to have a high attendance rate. They'd love if I just dropped dead, wouldn't even feel pity. Graduating school would help getting a job, but I couldn't even keep the one I had. But the thing is if I drop out then what? I'd probably focus on killing myself I guess. I sat in my shed for an hour with a noose dangliblng in front of me and I didn't even try. My drive for suicide has died down over the years I guess. Still there's not much else to do. I could try get better but at this stage I don't that's even possible. Especially with every therapist and doctor I've seen lacking empathy or whatever. They just want money, they go through too many patients to give a shit about them. I think I'm also afraid of being told I'm not mentality ill, because if they say that I can't prove them otherwise. Any attempt can be countered with 'he's faking it'. I hate that so much. There's also a party coming up. I want to go but since I can't go to school I doubt I can even go to it. It'd be a good party too bunch of friends going, alcohol and shit. I've never actually been drunk. I often wonder if it'd help me hang myself, or just chug a bunch of pills. I've actually never thought about suicide by overdose until recently. Read a story about it on here actually, an attempt at least. My mum's a nurse so you know I've got some good stuff lying around. That and I got shit prescribed anyway. I have some anti-depressants lying around and a shit tonne of pills for infections on my toes. I got both big toe equipped with ingrown nails. Makes life that big more miserable ya know. I got an operation on one, waiting for the other one. If I do end up killing myself it's shit like this that I'd regret. All the time and money others have out into making my life better only to be thrown away. But I guess I'd be dead and wouldn't care. Unless there's some sort of afterlife but I highly doubt that. I'm not a religious person, in fact I'm totally against religion but if I had the choice I'd make myself believe in God and heaven. It'd be reassuring believing without doubt I'll be in a better place. I guess no place is also a better place though. And suicide leads to hell some believe. There's an artist called rusty cage who made a song about it. Not really about, it was more one verse but it did get me thinking about it. I wish I could have a conversation like this to an actual person I could trust. My family hates me and I hate them right back. I'm not close enough to any of my friends to tell them. Except one, but he's gone and got his life in order. I'm proud of him, he's a lucky guy and I'm not going to ruin it by dragging him down with me. Therapists can fuck off too, I don't trust them. I hate opening up, especially to strangers. There's this one chick in our grade who's all doom and groom. I've thought about talking to her about it but deep down she's not broken. Even if she was and could relate I can't get to school, I'm not in many of her classes and she no longer chills with us. She knows guitar too which is badass. It sounds like I'm crushing on her but my crush is quite the opposite. Happy and cheery. I haven't properly talked to her in months. I had lost all feelings but a few lingered longer than others. Nostalgia, love and music. They all filled out though, months ago. But recently, today actually, or yesterday. I can't remember when, it may have been when I woke up or as I went to sleep but I was tired and thinking of her. Nothing exactly of her just the idea of her existence I guess. Or unconsciously thinking of her makes for better wording. And I felt that warm feeling in my heart for the first time in months. It went away but I guess i still like her. Texted her today and she's pretty over me tho. Best thing about not feeling is that you don't feel rejected when you get rejected. But nah it got me thinking. She's saved my life do many times just by existing. She's given me hope, a reason to live and a will to live, and I hate that. Maybe when I had a fighting chance at living a good life it was fine but now it's as if she's taunting me. I don't know, I still hope her all the best. Since I can no longer remember anything I tried to remember times we hung out or chatted and of course my mind went blank. I went through old Snapchat texts but most of the stuff wasn't saved, was from snaps or just real life. I went through old Snapchat texts from everyone. Not much shit really, anything that holds sentimental value happened in real-life and now I can't remember it. I guess even if it did I wouldn't care about it anymore. One of my favourite songs, banana boat, (Day-o) or something like that had so much nostalgia value and now it doesn't. Same with old videos or youtubers. Old books or drawings. Toys too. It's all gone. Everything I loved. Sounds sad but I can't even feel sad about it it's kind of mind-blowing. Like I know stuff should be really sad and I would cry like the emotional boy i was but now I don't. And I go to think about how crazy that is then I can't because I can't think. Then I think about that and I can't. It's just a bunch of no's and can'ts. I have had a few thoughts lately. A few weeks ago I was in the shower and I thought about a plot to a story I could make up. And it stayed in my mind until i write it on paper. Nothing else tho, not even during that moment. I went to think about how crazy it was and got blank, I just knew it was crazy even if I wasn't allowed to think about it. Weird stuff, but the story came out pretty good. Well not story, but the general plot of it. I've learnt showers soothe the constant voices a lot so I've been having long ones more. Cold ones work better. It's funny in movies you see someone with psychic powers or something go into a mental breakdown and they look real stupid holding their head and breaking down.

138,"Hi this is a throwaway account because I don't want people to somehow find out who I am. Anyways I've been on medication for severe depression and anxiety for the last 5ish years ( 19 now ) and recently I found it incredibly hard to talk to people or really feel anything if im not at least a bit drunk or high. For example when I have a presentation in college I need to be high on valium in order to be able to do the presentation, same now with this girl I met I cannot talk to her without being high or drunk. The first day we went out I took a decent amount of valium ( 30mg ) and still couldn't talk to her properly. I constantly feel as if I'm boring her out and she's going out with me just because she's nice and doesn't want to hurt me or something. This has now gotten to the point where I'm unable to have a conversation without being on something and I'm scared that I will become an alcoholic or turn to harder drugs. I don't have anyone to really talk to about this and it's bothering me a lot.

139,"So, I'm getting evaluated soon. The place I'm going to said I could opt to see a ""master level therapist"" or a psychiatrist. They suggested that I see the therapist if I wasn't sure if I wanted medication or not, which I'm not sure so I went with the therapist.

Now, I'm wondering if I should see the psychiatrist. I keep thinking their diagnosis may be more accurate (I have a LOT going on) and if they suggest meds, they could be better at explaining them to me. 

The place said both could give me a diagnosis, but my history with therapists trying to diagnose me isn't good so now I'm worried I picked I wrong option. I'm wondering which you would think would be more accurate with their diagnosis. Which would you pick?",24Feb2020,1
140,"Hello all  


I am 19 years old and this is probably the biggest problem I’ve faced all my life so please if you can take some time to help me .

141," 

I talked to my boyfriend of 2 years about moving into our own separate houses, due to his REALLY bad hygiene (showers once a week at most and is a cook so he gets gross and sweaty, rarely brushes his teeth, has dry skin on his nose and scalp all peeling off, in bad health, disgusting to live with, can barely face him to cuddle when we sleep, havent had sex in god knows how long). I have nagged him, talked deeply and expressed my concerns and willing to assist him to get better hygiene for the entire time we have lived together, but he never gets his act together.

Even the other day I made a compromise if he gets his act together with hygiene he can stay living with me but he said that he won't... so it said it all for me, and I was prepared to let him go and was thinking of even breaking the relationship off with him as its going no where.

About a couple months ago, he got diagnosed with tenosynivitus in his left hand and has been off work as a cook since, and went and got surgery for it. He is currently waiting to go back to work. He had bad hygiene long before all this happened though, and never cleaned the house.

2 days after the big talk of moving separate houses, he comes out with a big drunken speech on how hes been depressed and anxious all these weeks and feels so down about his future and his career, and that his hand might never get better etc. He looked so down and lost.

But at this point, I was so ready to break things off with him. He just has become like family to me now and I care about him but don't want to be with him, but now this mental health issue has come out of the closet, I am not sure what to do, as even moving out will cause him stress financially and I don't want him to get even more depressed if I leave him.

All he does is play video games and I can't imagine him ever going to get help or do anything positive like eating good, exercising lightly, getting hobbies or new interests. This is going to get him down if he can't work as a cook.

142,"I had been going to violin lessons for around a years and a bit and I was doing quite well before I had to stop because of a complete mental breakdown which pretty much put me out of functioning for 5 months.

I need someone to show me how to do all the vibrato stuff, I need someone to actually put me in for a grade exam instead of just pushing me through all the books (I can play bits of the grade 3 2019 violin book but I can’t do certain things I need, I’ve never done a grade exam)

143,"I’ve been back and forth for a while. There isn’t a tldr because the details are important to my story, I think. 

I think I might have an eating disorder. I’ve always wanted to lose weight, from when I was about 13 and realized that my weight was three digits (didn’t realize this was the healthy weight for my height at the time). I watched so much anime that the skinny ideal was perfection to me and as a perfectionist with bits of OCD (runs in the family and was raised by parents with it), being very thin was something I thought I needed. I worked out in my room on and off but never committed. 

Right before I went to college at 18, I downloaded MyFitnessPal to learn about macronutrients and learn how to cook/meal prep. It worked - too well. I went to college and cooked all of my own food, biked a few miles for all groceries every week, and lived out of a mini fridge. Obviously this meant I wasn’t eating much. I didn’t have a scale but I dieted restrictively very strictly with my app and eventually was underweight. When I realized I was underweight I was happy I finally dropped weight, but my family wasn’t, so they socially pressured me into eating all my favorite sweets over that winter holiday and I gained the weight back to my normal healthy weight.

Well then I was upset and felt too big. I liked being super tiny and thin, everyone had suddenly noticed me and was concerned for me. I’m very quiet/shy/reserved and very lucky in life. I’m ahead financially and academically, as well as seeming like I have my adult life together (I cook all my own food, invest my savings, study hard, workout daily, great resume, have a good job and promising college major, a really kind family, etc). So no one really ever is concerned for me. If anything, people praise me, but it falls flat because I just feel like it’s not true. I’m a product of my parents good job raising me and pointing me in the right direction. My accomplishments are because of them being awesome in shaping me and enabling me, I really don’t do anything other than do as I’m told. And I fail a lot - I get C’s on exams sometimes and have to CRAM for finals to recover my GPA. Sometimes I feel like I kinda have imposter syndrome in this sense. 

So I decided I wanted to be thin again - for myself to feel attractive, fit my personal aesthetic, and see if anyone would be concerned. So last year I started trying to purge (never succeeded), chewing and spitting constantly, fasting for a day at a time, giving myself migraines from not eating, only eating if I was done exercising (my gym performance went way down). I eventually confessed this to my boyfriend and he convinced me to stop - I only chew and spit occasionally now (my boyfriend was constantly critiquing my image, which didn’t help, but we’ve broken up now after a short time dating). I never ended up losing weight down to where I was before though because I went home again and binged constantly.

Now I’m at my heaviest weight (not far over my old normal healthy weight though) and I’m struggling to get off binging. I’ve gotten it to a controllable place and I’m starting the decline in weight again. Every time I meet someone who seems to care about me, I think, “Will you notice when I’m skinny again? Will you want me to take care of myself? Will you care so much that you’ll want to take care of me? What will you say? Will I be special then?”

I really hate bratty attention-seeker people. So I’ve been trying to suppress those needy attention-seeking thoughts. I still feel like I don’t want anyone to see/touch me until I’m thin again. I don’t want to buy new clothes or go out in public. I don’t want to eat unless I’ve worked out that day to the point where I can just flop on the couch without moving. I feel guilty eating breakfast if I overslept my workout and will have to go to the gym later. I love the feeling of hunger, it makes me feel like I’m trying hard enough. I am constantly thinking about food and linger around the kitchen, opening and shutting cabinets. I live alone so it’s easy to hide.

I just want to be pretty enough for people to care about me.",24Feb2020,1

146,"Hello all. Yesterday I had a conversation with my long time girlfriend where I broke down and sobbed in front of her. 

Essentially I believe my anxiety was triggered by my parents (specifically dad's) financial decisions. He lost a business and had attached our current house as collateral. Now they lost their home with a bunch of equity built into it. My mom had nothing to do with the business.

Long story short, myself and my siblings are now trying to purchase the house from them (basically bailing them out and charging them ""rent"" to live there to pay the mortgage almost as an investment between 4 of us) but I am taking the lead on everything (strategy, discussing with lenders, alternatives, risks, etc.). After 1 month and a half, I found a solution to keep the home within our family, which I'm extremely grateful for, but I still have severe anxiety and possibly depression.

From the inception of this nightmare, people warned me to take care of myself first, but I ignored them and told myself I was emotionally strong and capable. Turns out 2 months of constant thinking on this issue and seeing my parents distressed is finally taking a toll on me. I told my GF that I'm started to develop resentment towards my father, which I did not want to have bc I love him so much; I never want him to know that I'm starting to feel like this. He had already communicated to us that he failed us all, I see no reason to put more on his plate. My mother, on the other hand, is being dragged into this mess and all her life savings disappeared with the loss of the home. It saddens me deeply to see them go through this. I can't even imagine how they're feeling.

Now I'm here, waking up with no motivation to work, exercise, or do anything that would bring me joy. Every morning I wake up I immediately become anxious and I feel shortness of breath as if there is an elephant sitting on my chest. My head has constant pressure all the time. 

I found the solution to our problems, but I can't seem to feel happy, I actually feel worse than when this mess first started 2 months ago. I don't feel normal and it scares me.

150,"1st: Throwaway account so it's not linked back to my regular account 

Honestly, why is it that my child can suddenly be admitted to a mental facility for non stop negative thoughts, I'm going through multiple rounds of specialists who are trying to negate whether I have MS, or a similar vascular disease or if deep inside my sinuses is an infection that is causing some if not all of the symptoms.  

I feel like I failed my child.  His doctor wasn't sure what steps to take, amd I am stuck in between expensive arguing specialists who have some answers for symptoms but neither cover everything affecting me.  Also, I contracted scabies frok am employee but was 1st misdiagnosed with a viral infection for more than a week and in between all of it I was trying to find additional support for my child who has regularly seen a pediatrician, psychiatrist and weekly therapist for the past 5 years because I could tell he was off and he doesn't actively like participating in telling his docs the truth.  

I feel like I am failing as a mother. The in-patient facility has already scolded me because I couldn't talk when they initially called because I was getting ready to have a camera stuck up my nose which I've waited weeks to get into, and now my son thinks that I'm not doing everything I can to help him get home because he states he now realized that his life isn't so bad. 
I am barely able to keep up with all the responsibilities I need to.  Work is encouraging me to take FMLA but I  cannot afford to as I have already racked up $5K in medical debt that doesn't even include today's CT scan and the 2 MRI'S later this week.  I'm just barely holding it together and so many people wrote my son off as an, ""asshole"" because they fail to understand how his diagnosis truly affect him so I don't have a lot of people to help.  I'm already at my whits end and I still have to go through a bunch of tests this week, participate in family therapy and if he's released find the ability to drive 90 minutes away to bring him home.  I've been through a lot in my life and somehow I always make it through but right now I'm struggling to find the light at the end of this tunnel.  I find it sad that I'm hoping for a diagnosis rather than everything saying I'm fine.  I know some things I'm experiencing are real such as my lack of desire, numbness that starts at the waist and my inability to have sex but if we cant find the reason with the upcoming tests that are scheduled I am not sure what I will do.  I've at least submitted a request to my insurance for a case manager for my son as well as myself and I hope that this will help delegate some of the responsibilities of trying to find which facilities and docs both my child and I need.  I've also only told a handful of family and friends about the medical stuff I'm going through as I don't know exactly what I'm facing so there isn't a need to worry anyone with the unknown.

155,"Hello, I'm usually calm and people can describe me as funny and a little bit weird. The thing is, I'm extremely irritated by jokes like ""haha let's take his phone when he's not paying attention and hide it because it's very funny hahaha"" (this is just an example).

I got 2 close (not really  close, but something like that) friends and 1 ""normal"" friend in my class. Let's call my 2 close friends Jake and Paul, and the ""normal"" friend Carl.

My first rage that was noticed by them was the following: I was on my phone in math class, just chilling, and Jake and Carl started throwing pieces of paper and pieces of chewing gum at my back. At first I giggled, but then I told them repeatedly to stop. I got angry and I violently threw a book to Carl, then I took Jake's notebook and tore it to pieces.

Jake stopped doing stupid things like that afterwards.

My second rage that was noticed by them:
It was the class break and I put some money on my table so I can count it, but Paul thought it would be funny to grab the money and put it in his pocket. I told him to give my money back but he said ""no"" (he thought again that he was funny). I got angry and I told him to f*ck off and give me my money. I knew he'll give me my money back in the end but I didn't have time for his b*llshit so I grabbed his jacket's pocket where he put my money and pulled it. Then I saw that I accidentally ripped his jacket in the pocket's area.

Jake, Paul and Carl said that I got anger issues but I knew it was justified because I warned him about 5 times to give me my money back.

The third and the biggest rage was today:
I was doing my homework during the break and Paul, Carl and another ""normal"" friend called Vic didn't stop teasing me. They put things in my hood, like pens and papers, in order to annoy me. I told them a lot of times to f*uck off but they didn't fking stop. I reached my limit when Vic touched me with a pen behind my back as I was trying to finish my homework. I got up and jumped on him, squeezing his neck.
They said I'm crazy and Paul said they can't joke with me. I tried to explain that he has to be retarded to think they were funny doing that.

After each outburst, I returned very quick to the ""normal"" me. (the funny guy)

Maybe you think I'm a mad guy who never smiles, but it's not true. I usually laugh a lot with my ""friends"" and I can make almost everyone laugh if I'm in my mood.

161,"I promise, promise, promise. this is not a humblebrag.

This is something that I feel like I struggle with on a daily basis. 

I'm an only child, now 24, and female. Growing up my mother always taught me the importance of intelligence and kindness. Thay humor is more valuable than physical appeal. She herself is adamantly against vanity in all forms, including fashion, makeup, treating yourself, or focusing too long on your appearance. For her, this masquerades as being wholesome and down-to-earth, when in fact, it's very deep-rooted to her relationship with her vain mother and her own rejection of vanity is a form of vanity it's self (I've done a lot of work to fully understand this about her).

Obviously, being an only child, she has projected all of these personal feelings on to me... which has in turn given me a very skewed vision of myself.

Maybe I'm vainer than her. I always loved fashion. Despite her trying to beat it out of me, I also always wanted to be pretty... just... because... that's a relatively normal desire? I know that it isn't that valuable and that what's on the inside matters more, and it isn't everything for me... but feeling pretty and being perceived as attractive can get you places and give you more self-confidence.

I don't think that my mother has ever once told me that I'm beautiful or attractive or pretty in any way.

I feel like I don't have a radar of my own when it comes to analyzing myself. There have been times in my life when I've felt pretty and others where I have felt like the ugliest person in the room.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that this feeling has grown and evolved as I've gotten older, and has been particularly bad lately.

Ever since I started dating... I always had the attention of the most attractive, popular guys. I went to a hippy private school until High Shcool, when I switched to public and I was surprised with this dynamic. 

I did manage to come in with a bit of confidence. I have always been a social person... I remember the day that I realized ""I can just talk to anyone and it doesn't matter!"" so that did manage to take me far and I never had trouble making friends. - This is a generally attractive trait that doesn't have anything to do with appearance, so I guess I'm confident that I'm attractive in *that* way... but if that was all I had, how was I getting the attention of these guys?

I am a serial monogomer so I was in a relationship more than I wasn't throughout these periods. In college, I wound up having two whirlwind relationships off the get-go. I think, looking at all of this, aside from enjoying monogamy more, I didn't have the confidence in my appearance to feel comfortable dating around.

After the second relationship ended, I was 21, and that's when I really embraced being single. Right when that relationship was dying (it was dying for a while), I was standing on a street corner and an extremely, extremely beautiful man bounded across the street to ask for my number. I was taken aback, there must be some ulterior motive because he was way out of my league, or at least that's how I perceived him to be. I wound up ending my relationship a week later and hitting up that guy. We went on to casually hook up for about a month... and even though he was the player type he actually fell for me... and I didn't for him.

I had a few more flings and casual hookups that summer with people who I found both intellectually and physically attractive. 

I also found out that my recent ex's best friend had always been into me, someone who I was into from day one of university and always thought was waaaaay too attractive for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

That autumn, I met probably the most gorgeous foreign man that I have ever seen in my entire life. He was on exchange at my university for the semester. Everyone was swooning over him, my (hotter) friends were all into him, everyone thought that he was a model, but he was also smart, and funny, and really motivated in his career path. 

We got married this September. 

&amp;#x200B;

... and I think that this is actually somewhat of where my insecurity became even worse. I love him to absolute bits, he's my best friend and I'm incredibly lucky and grateful to have found this kind of love and companionship in my life. However, I still can't help but think... he could do so much better than me. When we're standing next to each other, meeting new people, I feel like they're judging us, me, thinking that he could do way better and wondering why he chose someone who looks like me. 

I know now that my charm and personality are a big strength of mine, but even just with that I don't know how I could pull someone like him, or some of the other guys I've managed to trap lol.

My concern now is that I think this insecurity is actually trickling down into my confident personality... which is sad... because that's my core.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that I shouldn't be that concerned with it... but I can't help it.

When people do compliment my appearance I feel like they're doing it out of pity. One of my friends calls me her ""pretty friend"" but she's *gorgeous* and knows so many other gorgeous people. I've also learned that other people, girls, really admire me and think that I'm 'perfect', the way I look, my Instagram aesthetic (I am absolutely not an influencer btw), etc. 

I don't get it. It's flattering at first but then I kind of take these compliments into my deep dark depths and pick them apart trying to find the insult or tone of pity that they contain. 

My husband says that I'm the most beautiful woman he's ever seen - bullshit. For one thing, I tell him not to use 'extremes' because they're instantly not believable... And there's no way that's true even in the slightest, we live in an incredibly international city with absolutely stunning people walking in and out of it all the time, models, celebrities, and so on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think ultimately, I just want to stop feeling so negative about myself... but I'd also like to have some understanding of my appearance because I really can't sum it up to save my life... 

Does this make sense? Does anyone else have this issue?",24Feb2020,1

But I dont know how to signal to him that I'm actually not ok in these situations. I feel like it's my fault because I just go completely emotionally limp and will go along with anything he wants like it's ok, so it's not like I can blame him for not knowing that I'm uncomfortable with what's happening. And like if i really didnt like it why did I go along with it in the moment but feel completely uncomfortable with it now the next morning?",24Feb2020,1

Hi there, my goal with this post isn't at all to get any pity or shit like that. I just wanted to ask y'all if u could give me a idea what possibly could be wrong with me because I feel like something up there isn't quite the way it should be. 

So first of all I always had a hard time opening myself to people and created myself a kind of mask to go out. However the last Years it got even worse to the point that I know have only a handful of people I even know closer. I also have a totally defunct dating life, because first, as said it's very difficult for me to open myself up to a person and second, I always feel inferior compared to other guys around me. I feel like I'm so much worse than all the other guys and thus not worthy of a girlfriend (saying this sounds so stupid I know but that's how I feel). I also overthink everything twice before doing it and going on any public meetings (f.e clubs etc) is a real hustle for me, because I don't feel comfortable at all around these places where often there are people that I perceive as being better than me. 

The next thing I wanted to mention is that I have problems falling asleep on a regular basis even if there isn't any reason or worry on my conscious mind that would keep me awake.

The last thing I think is important to mention is that I often have mood instabilities, meaning that I'm either very happy or very sad and I often cry when I'm alone etc. I've thought about killing myself, however I don't feel a particular urge to do it (Ive just considered it a few times as option if u understand how I mean this).

I´m to scared to ask my parents to see a mental health expert as I feel like they would just laugh at me and discredit my feelings (something they've done in the past too) as nothing more than a ""phase that teenagers go through"" .

&amp;#x200B;

I would really appreciate it to maybe tell me if these are indicators for a mental health and if so, for what kind. Because I don't really know who else to ask. 

&amp;#x200B;

Much love to you all",24Feb2020,1
165,It’s been a year since my psychosis appeared. For 3 weeks I had hallucinations and heard voices. After that I went to a psychiatrist and started taking meds. I gained a lot of weight(35kg). I’m not having periods. I don’t like going out much. I can’t even listen to music like I used to. I have no interest in anything at all. I don’t love myself anymore. I can’t even look at myself in the mirror. Please share your experience. How long will it last? Am I gonna be normal again?,24Feb2020,1
166,"I don’t really know where to start, but without anyone else to talk to, I’m hoping Reddit can be my sounding board. I’m sorry if this triggers anything in anyone. 

My mental health over the last few years has spiralled, with every element of my life becoming nothing but day to day mediocrity. I don’t mean that to sound harsh but after years, life’s becoming mundane and the absence of joy is debilitating. 

My job has changed into something I don’t want really want to do, it’s a big step back with little room to manoeuvre or advance. Fortunately my boss likes me, but that’s only going to last so long. People might think that’s awesome, you can get away with murder, but when you actually want to be good at something, it’s not enough. 

I’ve gotten lazy and that’s reflected in my body. I’ve gained a few KGs and that’s affected my confidence, my energy, my enthusiasm. As well as how my OH sees me. I’m back at the gym 5 days a week, and I’m trying my best with a diet but after a long day of crap, last thing you want is a carrot stick. 

I don’t have many friends, mostly colleagues. My family and school friends all live 200 miles away, and whilst I speak to my mum every week, I feel like I’m missing my nieces and nephews grow up, I’m missing those dinners, those afternoon drinks on a Sunday, those birthday parties. They’re so growing up and moving on without me. 

And my relationship. We’ve been together 10 years last week, a third of my life. I love him more than anything but it’s gotten hard. He’s in a new job so I’m trying to help out as much as possible. I sort out our dogs at lunchtimes, the house is cleaned, washing done, dinner cooked, coffee waiting for him everyday. It’s exhausting but I’m trying. He’s not interested in sex anymore. It’s been a best part of a year since we had sex. 6 months since we were intimate. He says it’s him, but I have a high sex drive and it makes me feel like a deviant when it feels like I’m being “given” Sex. I’ve made mistakes as I can be passive aggressive and shady at times but I’m trying to stop it. 

He comes home from work and sits on the other side of the room messaging his ripped gym mate. I got a chocolate bar for valentines and a card for our 10 year anniversary. I know it’s not about that, but the niceties go a long way. 

So here I am, writing this, waiting for him to get home so we can sit on other ends of the sofa in silence. Dinner is cooking and we’ll be going to bed in a few hours only to wake up and I go to a gym that doesn’t seem to be changing my body, a job that isn’t getting my nowhere, and a house that I’m trying to keep afloat. 

Looking forward there’s nothing that’s keeping my going. And I’d be lying if I hadn’t thought of more drastic measures to end what I see as a simply beige existence. I don’t know what to do. I have no one to talk to, and nothing to aim for. 

It might sounds like I’m whining, I know there are people going through much worse, but I’m stuck and I don’t see a way thought it.

167,"To keep it short,

When it comes to motivation, 
I mean yes I have goals. My only goals right now...
- Get my car paid off within a year. Then goto a trade school
- Finish Senior Year of High School with Cs or better
- Work full time with a second job once i’m 18 in 2 months
- Lift weights competitively

Side note: My stress with family and other shit right now is moderately high. 

With these goals, I don’t understand why I don’t feel much emotion towards them. They’re really just there. Especially whenever I goto the gym, it’s a nice stress reliever, but it’s nothing that motivates me. I find little pleasure in such activities too.

I only have 2 or 3 real friends. I do talk to them about my problems and such. I just feel little emotion towards other things. Mostly anything. Like yeah I care about other people. However I hardly can show it unless it’s a time of need.

I don’t know, all in all... I don’t feel or have thoughts or suicide/and or hurting myself or someone else. I have many motives to live for.

I just struggle to feel little emotion/and or pleasure and motivation for life. 

I can certainly be a bit sympathetic/or empathetic, however, it’s more of me knowing when to be either of those things. It’s usually just without much or no emotion at all. I just mentally know when to activate those type of emotional like-wise ways to think. 

Whereas I can give great advice and such. I just don’t feel too much towards them, unless it’s a situation that could put their life at risk.

Even whilst writing this, I don’t have much emotion. I feel a little bit bummed out that I am struggling this way. So not absolutely nothing. Almost though.

- Any advice on what I am dealing with? 
- Am just unfortunate to be mentally wired this way?

I just want to know how I can get to a point to have more emotion towards things. I am seeing my therapist in April. 

The only medication I am on adderall (10 mg 3x daily) for my more Inattentive/Impulsive ADHD, which I started taking this month. If that’s relevant to this post at all.

It honestly helps so much with being able to get through a long work shift. It helps to Stay in task at school. It also helps to just not be a lazy shit when I have nothing to do.

I started actually focusing a little on my future plans and goals ever since taking this. 

I have felt this way even way before this medication. This medication has not made anything worse. If anything, it’s made things a little better.",24Feb2020,1

Im 23, Male student with anxiety, depression , and consistent suicidal ideation. About 2 weeks ago, I was crumpling so badly under the pressure of school and life, I ended up seeing the school counselor desperately. I told her EVERYTHING on my mind, including my nihilism and thoughts of death vs suffering through life. She ended up admitting me to the emergency room, and I stayed there for like not even  6 hours. When I was admitted, I agreed because I was genuinely hopeful I would stay there for a couple of days and get some serious psychiatric help. But no, instead that stupid bitch of a psychiatrist basically guilt tripped me by bringing up how my parents can't support me forever, and we basically argued about whether or not I was actually in crisis and if I'm just desperate for attention. Regardless if she's right, I still fucking hate her. So despite explaining to them my thoughts of suicide in the future depending on whether or not life for me sinks to a lower level, I was seen as a whiney spoiled child that didn't want to deal with life... Something I've heard and been told many times.  Worst part, the hospital and ambulance Bill's are in the 1000's. 
Only barely good news is that my parents and I decided for me to drop down to a part time status, which means more tolerable school work, but an extra semester in career training, and losing the grant that helped pay for the classes.

Overall, I feel worse about life and myself than I did before. Thanks hospital",24Feb2020,1
169,"Ok so hear me out. I (16F) have a sister (14F) who has struggled with depression and cutting. She didn't tell me for the majority of the time but revealed to me in November that she had been depressed but had recently thrown her blade away. She told me she was getting better and I believed her. I told her I'd always be there for her, and she seemed like she was genuinely better.

 But yesterday I saw a glimpse of her arm and thought I saw two fresh cuts. I didn't say anything at the time, as we were about to leave for church and I didn't want to jump to conclusions. But afterwards I told her that that she could always talk to me and she shouldn't be scared to. She got really defensive and said she was fine. Later I remembered where she said she used to keep her blade and looked, and sure enough there was a broken pice of glass. She said she always got her blades from a broken mirror in our garage. 

That night I told her that I found her blade, and she said it was an old one and that she had been clean since November. I told her she shouldn't be afraid to tell me anything, and asked if I could throw it away. She said yes. I asked her if she was lying and she said she wasn't. So I threw it away. 

I have no idea if she was telling the truth. She didn't seem nervous at all when I asked her but she could be a good liar. She also could very easily get a new blade. I can't get parents involved because our parents are super religious and would probably just tell her she needs to pray more. Any other adults would tell our parents. And we're homeschooled, so we don't have school counselors. I know taking someone's blade away can often make it a lot worse, and I don't think I thought it through. What if I'm responsible for her relapsing even further? 

TL:DR I threw away my sister's old self harming blade, but I think she might be lying when she said she was clean and that I've hurt her.",24Feb2020,1

172,"Hello,

I have been thinking a lot lately. Reflecting on mental illness, my own and how it affects me, and my need to feel happiness (as someone with depression this truly is an obsessive feeling) and rather society's ""desire"" for happiness. 

Those that struggle to feel happy, we often wonder why it's so difficult to achieve? We try to scourge the internet for podcasts, books, mantras, etc on how to achieve lifelong happiness. And you know, in my mind, I've come to what I believe to be a healthy realization:

Happiness is a feeling, a state of mind. Just like anger, sadness, loneliness, irritability, jealousy etc. 

I feel like the reason why happiness is so ""out of our reach"" is because we keep trying to focus and obsess over reaching ""a point"" of happiness when it's an emotion like the rest.

I was SO focused on being happy and doing everything I could to be happy, that I neglect other emotions that are just as healthy to feel and need to be felt. Sure, someone can be happy often, but it's not a permanent state of mind. That's impossible, people feel anger and irritability or loneliness if even just a little bit. 

I think my obsession on trying to do everything I can to be happy has completely clouded my judgement on the fact that that's not possible.  I am setting myself up for disappointment and failure if I am to expect myself to be happy 24/7. That's just not sustainable. And realizing this has actually made me feel a lot better about being in a distressed state of mind every now and then. 

I'm curious what others think? I hope this was clear, I sometimes have a hard time really explaining what I am trying to say.",24Feb2020,1

I feel sad, exhausted and anxious almost everyday and I mostly spend my days sleeping (about 13 hours everyday) or watching youtube. I barely eat some days and do nothing but eat some days.

So that's how most of my days are, but sometimes I get drastic mood swings for no apparent reason. I randomly start to feel like I'm the best person in the world, like I can do anything and everything feels perfect. I go from feeling like I'm the worst person in the world to feeling like I'm the king of the world.

 This happens every 3 months or so and last about a week, ending very drastically and very easily.

184,"This is my first reddit post, so please excuse any mistakes. Also it's really long, sorry. There is a TLDR at the bottom.

My friend and I have been close since we were kids, and we are seniors in high school now. I struggled with depression a few years ago, but went to therapy and eventually felt much better (my friend knows this). For the past two years, I have seen her mental and physical health spiral downwards. I tried to help her by telling her about techniques I learned in therapy, but I knew that wasn't going to cut it, so I heavily encouraged her to go to therapy herself. She ended up going regularly for a couple of months about a year ago,  but suddenly stopped. She has gotten much worse now.

She frequently misses school, about every other day, and our school's administration is constantly showing up at her house to see what is going on. She gets mad about these visits, but I honestly can't blame the school when a student misses three days a week. I tried to talk to her about admitting herself into a in-patient care, but she insists it isn't that bad.

Her physical health is also very poor. She is unusually pale, her hair is falling out rapidly, and she says she only gets two hours of sleep each night. The most concerning thing for me is how she acts like she is proud of her poor health. It got really bad one month and she had to be admitted to a hospital (not mental fortunately/unfortunately) because her organs were practically failing.

She is always saying negative things and talking about how life means nothing. I'm not an optimistic person myself, but I try to counter these thoughts with positive ones. It doesn't seem to work though. She absolutely hates school and that is all she talks about. Because I used to have depression, she thinks that I will be able to relate to her problems, but I honestly can't. I know depression affects people differently, but the whole time I was depressed, I was trying to get help and recover. She tells me that she hates feeling this way, but she doesn't do anything to prevent those feelings.

Here is where I get the most upset. I am the president of a school club that has monthly meetings. She gets along well with people in the club, so I make sure to personally send her an invite, because she refuses to sign up for our remind services. I remind her a week in advance and then a couple of days in advance and then the day of. She will tell me in person that she'll be there and then she doesn't show. She doesn't have her driver's license, so she asks me to drive her home from meetings (which she doesn't show up to), leaving me confused, so I text her and never hear back. She asks me to give her rides to work, which are out of my way but I do it because I know she's struggling. A lot of the time she'll say she's at one place, and when I show up, she won't actually be there, leaving me waiting outside of her house, texting her, and receiving no reply.

I realized that I am too invested in the relationship. My own mental health has declined from these interactions, which bothers me a lot considering how hard I worked to feel better. Now, when she asks me for rides and other one-sided things, I lie and tell her I'm too busy. Whenever she jokes around about depression, I change the subject or even leave the situation all together, making excuses for why I have to go. I haven't talked to her in a week and ignore contact with her through mutual friends. My parents and friends think that I'm mean for doing this and that I should be there for her, but she is draining the happiness I've worked so hard for. Is what I'm doing horrible or healthy boundaries?

188,"Hey all, just a bit of a vent here. 

I’m 32 years old, and have had my ups and downs with mental health over the years. I’ve delved pretty deeply into caring for myself through a few years in alcohol treatment / therapy, so I like to think I’ve gained some perspective and know when to take an internal inventory and run a bit of a systems check. 

More to the point: I seem to seek out content that I know habitually causes me stress. I’ll spend an hour or so browsing the subs like trashy / Iamatotalpieceofshit / public freak outs, and invariably I end up feeling tense, high strung, and unfortunately angry. I wind up getting so pissed at the ways I see people mistreat each other, lash out violently, or otherwise be so obtuse to their own surroundings that they make an entire room subject to their bullshit. 

On the whole I’m *not* a generally angry person or someone who adopts a “doom and gloom” mindset about others. I think part of it is that I live in a fairly rough area, or at least one in which a *lot* of the sort of behavior I find on those subreddits seems to exist. This leaves me with encountering situations that cause me duress on my commute to / from work, going to the grocery store, or just going *anywhere*. 


I’m aware that a pretty simple solution to this is to occupy my time in other ways when I feel that tendency to start seeking this content out. I know the triggers pretty well by now as well. If I have a bad day, or if I’m otherwise generally feeling fed up with “other people”, it seems like that leads me to finding all of this to almost legitimize why I’m feeling angry. 

With that said, I guess I needed to write this down to get it out of my system a bit. I’m also curious if anyone else seems to do this. One person put it to me as a form of “mental cutting”, and while it was said mostly in jest, it did make me think a little harder about it.

190,"So I have a friend I've known since I was a kid and for the last 5 years something has changed about him. We used to talk about some deep stuff, sometimes under the influence. We both come from the same religious background so our topics ranged from religion to politics. 

One day he started saying he could see stuff. Then he said there was a ""spirit"" that would speak to him revealing some great truth. I would indulge him and ask him what he learned and it's basically word jumble. He'll take a word then dissect it into one or two other words in the hopes of proving a connection between the words and then building a theory from that. Well that was a rabbit hole I was really ready for but I tried to hang in there but all I could really see was a fragmented mind trying to make sense of the world. 

Just before it happened he lost his dad, the girl he was with who he thought was having his baby turned out to have cheated on her (which you could tell by the race of the child which he was in denial with for the first few years) and he has been struggling with drinking ever since as well. 

Ive asked him if he's considered seeing a doctor about all of it but his religious background seems like it lets him justify the occurrences as supernatural. I personally feel like they may be symptoms but I don't want to make him defensive about it so I try to avoid topics pertaining to it. 

I'm worried about him and how mentally stable he is. He can carry on a conversation and all like normal but when you get home going about the word jumble stuff he becomes obsessive and will just bombard you with info at almost a manic rate. Any idea why he scrambles words to find ""hidden"" meanings to tie events and such together? 

I'm wondering if he's suffering from a serious mental illness or maybe had a pyschological break when all that happened and he's been drinking to run from it or even to try and drown the voices he says he hears.",24Feb2020,1
191,"My 16 y/o son has had depression, anxiety, and PTSD for over two years and has become marijuana dependent over the past year and a half. He's gone from an A/B student in 9th grade to failing all of his classes now in 11th grade. He's been seeing two different therapists for over two years and does not seem to want to take any treatment seriously. Because of his consistent use of marijuana, his failing grades, and his resistance to weekly outpatient therapy, his therapist has suggested we admit him to a teen inpatient facility that uses a cognitive behavioral therapy approach.

193,"Hi guys,

First want to start of by introducing myself, im a illustration student from the Netherlands in my final year. Im currently making a graphic novel for my graduation project with a focus on mental health and how difficult the recovery process can be. I myself have had an eating disorder, depression and I have ADHD. Now that im feeling better I decided I wanted to channel this experience into a graphic novel.

I want the story to be inclusive. Its not going to be purely autbiographical but the main character is going to be white, as I am white and basing it on personal experiences but changing a lot of things The main character will have a friend who is POC (not decided on her ethnicity yet, still very early stages). Ive noticed that a lot of mental health stories always have the kinda frail, thin white girl in it.  I want to make something that shows more than just that demographic.

The main character is going to have a lot of struggles and gets kinda caught up in it, kinda forgetting that her friend struggles too. I want to represent the (female) POC experience as accurately as possible within the story, I want to make a character that stands up and calls her friend out when its needed. I want the main character to become more aware of her position in the friendship and better herself because of it. I want the friend to be her own autonomous person without any tokenism, not her to be there in the story just as a filler position as a friend. I want to represent a friendship that isnt just roses and sunshine, but mature enough to work it out and learn from eachother.

If anything sounds irky or not right please say so. I really just want to ask, as a white person, how can I represent a POC best in a mental health narrative? POC, how was your experience in your mental health journey? How do you think it differs in how the people around you act or treat you? Im very open to having a conversation about this and I would be supe r thankful if someone could help me out. Thanks in advance!",24Feb2020,1
194,"I'm not feeling suicidal or anything like that. But I came to university for the first time about 4 or 5 months ago (I live in the UK so we live away from home and I live *quite* far from home) and recently I've been finding things quite difficult. I was quite upset a little bit earlier today and reached out to my academic supervisor for help and I've never had to do that before. But now I feel a little bit better after chatting to my girlfriend about it. And my feels in general over the last couple weeks have been oscillating a bit. My question is:

Is it common to feel as though I had 'mistakenly' thought I have depression when I don't really, once starting to cheer up a bit? Like I said, I don't feel as bad right now as I did a few hours ago and I start to doubt whether what I have is something ongoing at all. I think this might have happened to me a couple of times. I certainly feel as though I've had some noticeable, reoccurring issues in the last few weeks but can't actually recall them.

206,"Hey guys i (M 25) have been in a predicament with sadness (we'll call it that because I'm not officially diagnosed) as well as with anxiety and rage as well (possibly bipolar?) For as long as i can remember, it became really prominent by the time i was 12. It's just so hard to be happy, i can manage it in short bursts but it seems like it all eventually crashes and burns and i go back to being depressed. I'm married and i love my wife but i feel like we're starting to have a terrible relationship because of how constant my mood changes are and how hard hitting this gloom is that takes over me everything is just so grey when that happens and i lose a sense of purpose. Little things that bare no significance irritate me to the point of rage. I even broke my hand as a teenager by punching a wall over a game of basketball (i know, idiotic) Sometimes i hit the point of snapping and throw things, or hit myself. Or even in some cases i feel like a hot flash and for a split second i just think that it'd be better to just slash my wrists than deal with whatever the problem of the moment is. 

Growing up my Mom took Zoloft for her depression i think? I vaguely remember and i don't think it changed much in her. My question is, even if i was seen about this and got diagnosed, got on the right medicine and maybe went to therapy would that fix it? Or is taking those steps even worth it? Is this something i need to work myself through or something that those things can help with? I really want my life to be happy, i want to be thankful for what i have and just be a better husband/step father.

207,"(first I want to clarify that she told me her psychiatrist thinks she has bipolar disorder, she herself is not sure about it. I don't know the details and from the symptoms, I assume its bipolar II disorder)

She is really nice extroverted girl I wouldn't say she is hyperactive but definitely has energy. Thus I assume she has hypomania and not mania. She is also quite a busy person. We have been dating for 3 months now and I know her for 4 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I knew her, her Depression periods have been in a cycle of a month for +- 4 days during which she doesn't want to see anyone, not even me, doesn't leave her room, doesn't want to do anything. (it gets better closer to the end of the depression period) Sometimes she is not tired at all and doesn't sleep much and sometimes she is very tired but I wouldn't say that anything extreme... just a bit more sleepy than an average person. (I can't recall how often sleep differences happen but it's in a matter of a couple of days a month). She doesn't take any medication, she is going to psychologist sometimes and she knows she has some mental health problems but apparently she is not sure if she has bipolar disorder or if she believes it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm quite an emotional guy and it pains me very much seeing her depressed and not being able to do anything. I definitely don't plan on leaving her because of it, I love her and I will do my best to support her no matter what.

&amp;#x200B;

What kind of relationship should I expect?

Is there anything I can do for her during her depression periods? To make her feel better?

Anything I can do to try to prevent the depression?

Is being alone really best for her?

What I definitely shouldn't do?

Anything other I should know?

228,I recently learned that feeling disconnected with my body and having trouble with it listening to me is a symptom of my anxiety disorder.

What you are about to read is %100 true and does have some information that some people may find trigerring. That being said, my goal with this post is to help those of us that have suffered look at things differently. Please continue to read this long ass novel at your own discretion. 

I've thought long and hard about whether or not I should put my story online for the world to see and the conclusion I have came to is ""If I can help  1 person to live to see another day just by telling them my story, then why the hell not!?""

So here it goes...

I am currently a 23 year old living in Canada. I have 3 younger siblings, 2 of which are blood. My entire life since the moment I was born has been less than what you would call"" normal"". My mother had me at the ripe young age of 16 and only graduated grade 10. My father was always at work while my mother stayed home to care for us. Because my mother had me at a young age with little education she relied on welfare and child tax credit to provide an income for us.

Growing up I was bullied a lot. I wore glasses so I was often called 4 eyes. I had snow and dirt kicked in my face on multiple occasions. I had kids lock me out of school in the middle of the winter after the bell rang to go back inside from recess. I got called ugly, fat, a pig, annoying, nosey and a brat almost on the daily. I had very few friends and the few I did have were mostly rude to me.

Outside of school, I was sexually molested by my female babysitter when I was about 7 years old, to the point where I still remember her name, the old house they used to live in, the way the rooms were set up and every disgusting thing she did to me.

Fast forward to when I was 9, this is where things started to take a terrible turn in my life. My mother was prescribed oxycontin, percocet, t3s and other sorts of pain killers at any early age (20). If you know anything about these pain killers, you know that they are highly addictive. So basically, around 9 years old my mother started drinking (while being on prescription pills). I vividly remember the day she started and never stopped. My mother would drink a 26er of whisky STRAIGHT every day; minimum. She would get so plastered drunk that she didn't know who I was anymore. At first I was told that mom was just having some fun with her friends and being silly. But things kept getting worse; mom kept drinking, friends stopped coming over, and mom started getting angry and violent.

She would say terrible things to me like ""You're a stupid little bitch"", ""I wish I never fucking had you"", ""How dare you talk back to me"" and other things that just plain and simple didn't make any sense. There were a few occasions where my mother put her hands on me. On one occasion my mother back handed me with a closed fist while she was drunk because I told her I was eating what she was putting on my plate (for context: she put stale 3 day old rice, chicken bones and raw sliced up onion on a plate in front of me). My father was so furious and concerned about my mother hitting me that he refused to allow me to go to school for the next few days.


There were several times where my siblings and I would stay at my grandparents house to be in a ""better environment"" than what we were in. To be truthful, as a child you would be under the impression that your grandparents house where you can eat and watch tv is much safer than being around an abusive mother. However, my grandparents were and still are far from guardian angels. My grandparents have been living off of welfare since before I was born. Not only that but they have been addicted to prescription pills and hard drugs my entire life. At 9 years old I figured out that they were doing heroin because of the dirty spoons, needles and blood stains I found in the bathroom. They would get so high (and still do) that they start to ""nod off"" to sleep and sometimes stay ""asleep"" for hours on end. They would ask me for money and would take any change I had in my piggy bank. And would ask me to roll them cigarettes and make them coffee on the regular. These are not exactly people you would call good role models.

**ATTENTION : VERY DETAILED AND TRAUMATIC EVENT COMING**

Flashforward to when I am 12 years old. My sister is 10 and my brother is 5. After a few years of dealing my mother's addiction, she finally tried to get help through rehab. The one thing that the doctor said to my mother was that she could not quit what she was doing cold turkey as she would have serious health issues doing so. My mother as stubborn as she was did not listen to this advice and because of that began to have seizures. So one day I came home from school with my 2 younger siblings. I walked into the house with them and saw my mother laying face down on the couch almost in the downward dog position. Now before you say ""that's weird"" or ""why wouldn't you see what's going on immediately"", please keep in mind that this was a regular occurrence for me as a child so I didn't think much of it. I ignored it initially and went to the washroom. I came out and she hadn't moved at all so I decided to go up to her to see if she was okay. She was ice cold, I'm talking colder than the coldest skin you've ever felt in your life. I shook her and said ""Mom, mom please wake up?"". Nothing happened. At this point so many thoughts are rushing through my mind and none of them positive. I could see that her fingertips had turned purple and I knew in the back of my head what this was... But I needed to be sure. I needed to see her face. So I got down on both of my knees and tilted her head towards me just enough that I could see her face. What I saw is something straight out of a horror movie and I will never be able to erase it from my mind. Her face was the darkest purple and blue I've ever seen. Her eyes were rolled back in her head. Her nose was bent due to the constant pressure of her body weight being pressed on her face. Her mouth was wide open and her lips blue as could be. Without hesitation I fell back and screamed at the top of my lungs. My mother was dead. I immediately grabbed my younger siblings and got them outside so they didn't have to look at her like that. I grabbed my mom's cell phone and called my dad at work saying ""you need to come home right now, mom's dead, I don't know what to do"". In the most scared voice I've ever heard from him he said ""take your brother and sister and run to the neighbours and call 911"". We lived in the country so the neighbours house was pretty far but I knew I had no choice so I did exactly that. This is the day my life changed forever.

After my mom passed there was a period of time where my father wouldn't come home for a few days at a time. He would go to work, get plastered drunk to try and forget everything and then repeat. I was left to take care of my siblings on my own most days which involved, cooking, cleaning, bathing and homework;among many other things. My father met another girl not long after my mother passed (3months). My sister and I were very angry as we barely grieved over our mother and did not expect him to move on so quickly. 2 more months pass and my father tells me that his new girlfriend is pregnant and they are not getting rid of the baby.

A year following my mother's death, I got a call saying that my very close uncle (my mother's, sisters husband) had died in a tragic car accident and that my aunt and cousin were injured. Another funeral to go to.. Woohoo.

2 months later my half sister was born and I fell in love with her, although still resentful of my parents.

I don't want to make this too long as I want to get to the actual point of my story but I will sum up the rest of what has happened in my life up until this point.

A year after my uncle died, my grandpa (dad's dad) died. A year following that my cousin who was 16 hung himself because of depression. A few months after that my niece died due to SIDS at 6 weeks old.A few months later my grandfather (mom's dad) died due to cancer in the ICU. 6 days before my mom's death anniversary. My graduating year of high school I moved to my aunts who had a graduation party for all of us at the end of the school year. At this party one of my cousins best friends that I have known since a small kid drowned in the lake at my aunts house at 14 years old. A few months later my great grandma and great grandpa both passed away due to Dementia and Parkinsons. 
A year or so afterwards my boyfriend/fiancee that I had been with for 7 years and had spent $20k on a wedding for... Broke up with me 2 months before our wedding date. Slept with a 17 year old, while also leading 2 other girls on. He was also abusive both emotionally and physically. This happened a week after we got into a car accident that could have ended both of our lives (tboned at a red light).

All of these events left me broken; physically, emotionally and financially. I was at a point where I wanted nothing to do but to end my own life. How could things possibly get better when they only seem to be getting worse? How could anyone possibly care about me? I was in such a dark place that I decided to make a smart decision and admit myself to the hospital in fear that I would take my own life. It was a long 8+ hour wait but I finally spoke to someone. The psychiatrist gave me a referral to start therapy through the hospital and prescribed me some medication to help regulate my emotions. This was the start to something beautiful.

From the time that I admitted myself to the hospital and now a lot more bullshit has happened. I've lost several more people who are close to me. I've had several job losses and places I've had to move. I've had to beg people for money just so I could pay my bills and eat. I've had my dog (the one therapy outlet I relied on most) stolen from me, and the authorities are doing little to nothing to help get her back to me. I am in debt up to my neck. I'm in constant pain from my car accident all the time. I'm currently sleeping on an air mattress in a small room because this is all I have left for options.

The purpose behind everything I have just said is to give you a different perspective.

My life has been what most people would call terrible, traumatic, horrendous, sad etc. But I always tell myself, it's not the cards that you are dealt but it's how you play them.

It has taken over 10 years for me to get to a somewhat stable spot in my life. 10 YEARS to be mentally sound enough to function somewhat ""normal"". And here is what I've learned.

Our childhoods are one of the most influential factors as to how we turn out as adults. You won't grow up thinking you are smart or beautiful or worthy if you have always been told and treated other wise. However, how we were raised and the things we experience are not an excuse to be crappy adults or to treat others poorly or to not help ourselves. Everything that has happened to you cannot be changed. But what we can change is how we react to it and what we decide to do with the bad things that are dealt to us. It sounds so cliché but when life gives you lemons make lemonade! I know, I know, easier said than done right?
It's not easy trying to be positive and do good things for yourself when it feels like your whole world is falling down around you. But anything in life that is easy isn't worth it, and anything worth it won't be easy. Now I certainly don't have everything figured out and I still struggle on a day to day basis with my health, but going through therapy recently has really opened my eyes to the reality that there is so much more than the heartache and pain you've gone through. Although there might be a lot of shitty things going on in your life, there are also a lot of good things too, you just need to look for them. 

I would like to encourage anyone who is going through hard times to seriously consider getting help. Even if you have tried before, try again because the result of it working far outweighs giving up and suffering through. You have one life and one life only. There is no reset button, there is no do overs, this is all you've got so make the best of what you can while you still have time. 

In closing, I want anyone who has read this far to know that you are not alone in your struggles. There are many people out there who are more than willing to listen and help in anyway they can. Your problems no matter how small or big they might seem are valid. You are not crazy. You are not stupid. You are not too sensitive. You are kind. You are important. You are loved. If any of you need advice or a listening ear, please do not hesitate to ask. Thank you for listening to my story.",24Feb2020,1
233,"I'm  28f, need to vent, and don't really have anyone in real life to do so  with so here I am. I know there's nothing unique about my feelings  but....I don't know maybe I'm looking for catharsis or validation,  possibly both, regardless here goes nothing.

I'm  burnt out on life. I have no desire to do anything but sleep. I have  friends, family, hobbies, I work out, I do martial arts, I'm on meds,  I'm doing therapy, I'm really trying to make things better but nothing  seems to work. I'm really losing hope that anything will change for the  better, I'm mostly just trying to keep things from sliding  downward,  but if my life is the same as it is now in 5 years I don't know that  I'll be able to continue coping.

I  cant help but feel alone all the time. I have friends I spend time with  and enjoy but there's always a level of distance I find I cant quite  bridge, like a disconnect that I cant figure out. I shouldn't feel alone  in a room of people I know/like but I do, I've even noticed it  happening with family which seems even worse. My best guess for the  disconnect is how many times Ive formed close bonds with someone only to  find out the relationship we had was one sided (in both friendships and  romances). Again, nothing that doesn't happen all the time but it hurts  to give your all only to find out you were never important to them.  Best guess is I started subconsciously keeping people at arms length  (the natural coping mechanism I assume) but it doesn't feel like that,  more-so it feels like I'm controlling a character in a video game in  that I'm invested in the characters and stories but I'm always aware  it's ""not real"". I don't know, it just kind of sucks.

Like  most ""alone"" people I also have 0 luck in the romance department. My  second biggest life goal is the common ""find my soulmate"" malarkey but  my exact want would be to find someone perfect for me. Any partner will  have flaws as a human so I'm not chasing ACTUAL perfection but someone  I'm attracted to on all levels despite/because of their flaws and who  feels the same about me. Being pansexual you'd think it wouldn't be  difficult to find potential candidates but there aren't a lot of people  who spark that interest in me and when I do find someone intriguing they  don't feel the same about me. I'm quite good looking but I'm also just  kind of odd cause, ya know, human. People want to sleep with me but they  don't want ME, they want a hot goth chick to screw on occasion. I  wouldn't have a problem with that if they were honest about it but they  always feel ""obligated"" (as my most recent ex put it) to form a  relationship and lie to me to do so. I just want someone to love and to  genuinely love me back, a real partner. I honestly ache for such a  connection to the point my days are almost consumed in overwhelming  loneliness. I'm fine on my own, enjoy my alone time, and know who I  am/what I'm looking for but still feel like I'm searching for something  that doesn't exist and it feels hopeless. I go out, I talk to people,  I'm not a shut in waiting for amazon to deliver me a romantic partner  but.....I don't know it feels like any effort I make to find even a  potential partner ends in catastrophic failure. At this point I'm  putting my faith in sex-bots. I will always maintain I'd rather be alone  than with someone who isn't right for me and that wont change but damn  it feels like a bleak, pointless, fruitless endeavor.

I  also want to travel but cant afford it, I'm facing down the reality  that even with my solid job I may never be able to afford a house, my  job is a sea of monotony despite how much I like the  environment/coworkers, and I just feel fucking stuck. The typical  ""everyone I know is getting married/traveling the world/has their dream  job etc while I cant figure out anything"" bullshit I'm sure everyone  feels at some point but fuck is it bleak. I feel so stagnant and every  time I try to break out of it my efforts to make things better fail and I  fall back to square 1 (or further back if I'm not careful). I'm glad my  life isn't worse, there are definitely worse positions to be in, but I  find it to be absolute crap that the only thing I can realistically hope  for is that things don't get worse. I want things to be better but I  have no idea where to start and all I seem to get are stock answers of  ""oh things will get better you'll get there"". How? When? My entire life  has felt like the ""when will my life begin"" song from Tangled and I'm  losing hope. My cat and my family are the only reasons I haven't ended  things myself. I let my life play out in my head and find myself  preferring death than living this same life 5 years from now (chronic  depression since age 13 hasn't helped with that tbh but does mean I'm  adept at ignoring the desire to off myself).

I  don't know what I'm looking for with this post, mostly I think I just  need to say it somewhere other than therapy. I get into it a little with  friends but they aren't my therapist. My therapists have always given  the platitudes of ""life constantly changes"" or ""don't worry you'll get  there"" but that doesn't help. None of that makes me feel better about it  and at the same time I don't have an answer as to what WOULD help or  what help would look like to me. Guess for now I'll just try to continue  to distract myself with my art, video games, books, clubbing, and all  the other junk I do to kill time but.....fuck.....I just want my life to  be what I know it can be I guess. I welcome  thoughts/feelings/opinions/etc, but if nothing else, thanks for reading  my rantings. Today has been a very down beat kind of day",24Feb2020,1

On nostalgia and bipolar: 

The year was 2000, I know because the Red House Painters ‘All Mixed Up’ song was in a Gap commercial and I became addicted to the song and to the other music that Red House Painters put out. It was sad music. Not emo sad, but rather stripped down music with sad lyrics. I had turned my bed and dresser around in my room in a way that the dresser walled my bed in and my feet were up beside the window. To get in or out, you had to shimmy by a small space at the bottom of the bed. I had bought a baby crib bumper at value village because I liked the print, and I put that around my bed. It was the first safe space I would make. I was 20 years old and in the thick of the longest, most intense mania I have ever been in. I was in a relationship that at the time seemed like the most beautiful thing in the world. Falling in love while experiencing a manic episode is so very, very intense, and that’s putting it mildly. When I wasn’t visiting him I was in my safe space, listening to Red House Painters and ruminating. I think I was writing a bit as well, even though the intensity I felt for the relationship  could not have been adequately articulated so anything I wrote would be dull by comparison. This relationship, him, he was on my wavelength, intense and brooding and cerebral, intellectual. We called ourselves the broken beauty chasers. The mania served to heighten the euphoria and depth. I am in a happy and healthy relationship now, but still to this day I think about that relationship. Seeing how much mania played a part in its fierceness is difficult. This is not to say I wasn’t in love, because I was deeply, utterly in love. But bipolar was a third party, and ultimately led to our demise. When you’re manic you think of sadness (or at least I do) as beautiful. Such intense beauty. It’s so hard to articulate. I felt like I was part of something big when I was with him (ahem- bipolar red flag). I had this vision, maybe it’s even fair to call it a delusion, in my head of a room of people with winced faces who just ‘knew’. .Knew what? Not being in mania today, I have no idea what ‘knew’ means. In fact, in one of my journals it said that if I don’t feel like I was in the room of people who just ‘knew’ to stop any medication I was on to keep the feeling alive. ‘Just Knew’ was an unexplainable power (again- classic bipolar symptom: delusions of grandeur). It was a feeling, a knowledge of something other people didn’t know about except for a choice few. I was one of those people with winced faces who just ‘knew’. I was so convinced of this ‘knew’, of its existence, I would ask others if they ‘knew’ too. Some people would just nod slowly, others changed the subject, and still others would assuage me with a confused ‘yes’, concreting the existence of it, heightening the intensity. Mania isn’t just euphoria, it’s intensity as well. Everything becomes so very intense. I had that manic intensity for most of the 4 years of our relationship. It is the longest I’ve ever been manic. And that, I have to tell myself, is what I miss. The nostalgia I feel is for mania. More than anything I miss that room full of people who just ‘knew’. 
With nostalgia, it is rarely the thing/person that we miss. It is the feeling we had when we were there that we miss. If you are bipolar like me, never confuse a reality with a cycle. If you associate a memory with happiness, oftentimes it is the happiness you miss, not the thing that was responsible for it. Don’t confuse the act with the way it made you feel.

235,"So about a year ago me and my girlfriend broke up. The break up wasn’t that messy I was really depressed and (not to her knowledge) addicted to pain killers, I wanted a week break, I told her it was to get my shit together but really it was to go through the torture of withdrawal without her seeing me like that. I got clean in that week and asked if we could continue where we left off she said she didn’t want to and we broke up. About a week later I got in a fight with someone(I didn’t really start it, someone followed me around campus insulting me and telling me to fight them for 4 hours until I punched them) and my ex texted me seeing if I was okay because I got a bloody nose. I didn’t take well to this and basically said she never cared about me so why is she trying to now, basically just being really immature. She blocked me on everything and then for about a few months I was depressed and got drunk and high a lot but gradually got better. Fast forward to about a month ago I didn’t have any friends and was really isolated, I decided that because at one point me and my ex were best friends maybe we could be just friends. I texted her apologizing for being inconsiderate and asked if we could be friends and if she didn’t want to I understood. Her response was she blocked my number and showed the text to a lot of her friends(some were mutual acquaintances of mine who told me) and talked a lot of shit about me, and also went around campus showing the message to people making fun of me. After this i really hated her and got completely over any desire to be friends within about a week. I didn’t think about her until last night when I had a dream with her in it. The dream was usual bullshit I think I was at a football game or something but at the end of the dream I had a conversation with her and saw her face and I immediately woke up and felt lonely and sad and disturbed. Why do I still care about this woman, why do I still think about her, why do I think about her when I’m singing to myself alone in my room or when I am painting or drawing. I don’t want to care she obviously doesn’t care about me and wants to forget me, yet i still do. How do I remedy this.",24Feb2020,1

237,"This is just gonna be a nice wall of text about anything and everything than im thinking at the moment

Okay starting this with the fact i have awful memory, specially for a 16 year old. This causes problems all over the place with frie ds, school, and occasionally family. As a male i was always taught to be ""manly"" and hide my emotions and shit because i'd be made fun of otherwise. Im now extremely aware of my emotions and have trouble showing any at all, i quickly start overthinking and the moment passes before I reach a conclusion.  I just realized theres going to be no real order to this wall and im sorry to those that are so vallantly going through it. Recently i've felt a wonderful mix of ambition and overwealming lazyness(?) that has me torn between my hobbies (anything i find i ""want"" to do, really) and work (the opposite) so then i do neither. Time seems to be going faster than i remember, friends have gotten different interests and split apart. We all still see eachother at school though which makes us have to be all buddy-buddy with eachother regardless. Noone seems capable of holding conversation for more than 10 minutes. My only surviving afterschool friend has recently gotten help for his declining mental health (im super glad, wish i could join him) and left my school for a better place (not the dead place, an actual place? I dont feel like doing grammar or fixing anything...) I havent talked to him recently as he's probably dealing with alot. Bouncing back to my family... father is a lovely guy thats had multiple girlfriend at the same time, mother blames all her problems on other people (i got used to it, worry that she hurts herself sometimes) She isnt really a responsible person in anyway, but my grandmother taught me how to take care of myself. I think of killing myself constantly but cant find a reason to. I just want to be happy or at least know when i am? I dont know how I feel half the time its like a storm of emotions but its all outside my little cave, i dont come into contact with it but i know its there. I space out constantly, maybe its defensive? I feel sympathy when i see others be shunned for their happiness (my poor prof. tries to cheer the classroom up, only to be met with glares), so I think im fine as far as that goes. I just noticed i might need to state i dont take any medication for anything and i dont drink or do drugs or anything that could affect my mental state. I think im past whatever I just wrote, im a pretty normal guy outside my head. 

I think the question i wanted to ask was something along the lines of if i might be depressed, the reason being with the overwealming demotivation and thoughts of death. Maybe something about my foggy memory and waning (fading? inconsistent?) consiousness of self

This is mostly fragments of stuff ive put together while thinking about myself, with some added as i went, i wish i could make something more coherent but its hard to remember/get my thoughts straight.

TLDR: im fine, I need to be fine until I can get proper help.",24Feb2020,1
238,"Please don't read this if there even a tiny chance it could  trigger any undesired feelings on you. I already appreciate you initial action of clicking on my post. 

---

My mind started to wonder what is it like to self harm, more specifically cutting. 

It feels more like a curiosity thing, to explore what level of physical sensation feels all right, at which point it becomes pain, if it ever does actually, at which point I say it is time to stop, etc.

I'm normally very tolerant to physical sensations/pain, like if my body have become somewhat ""unimpressed"" by the sensations. And I see this as a potential trigger for it, my mind or body wanting to feel something.

At least all of this is seen just like a wonder, and never got close to a desired to actually do something. And when the thought comes, not wanting any scar are always there helping it not go further, I already have enough dysphoria with my body, creating more things I don't like in it is, for now, out of question.

But of course, the fact that this thoughts and considerations exists are already concerning.

I want to seek professional help, for that and other mental problems as well, and nothing is holding me back other than myself just making the appointment. It is so irrational...",24Feb2020,1
