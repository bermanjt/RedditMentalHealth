0,"So I’m a 22 year old female who has struggled with depression for years. I finally started going to therapy a few months ago and got put on antidepressants; which I think has helped tremendously. I’ve wanted to hang out with people. Get out of the house. Live my life. Seems like they’re working, right? According to my mom though she preferred the depressed daughter who never tried to leave the house and constantly was suicidal. She has contacted my therapist on numerous occasions saying the meds need to be changed and that I’m not the same daughter anymore. My birthday is also this week and she’s beyond livid that I wanted to go out with my friends this weekend and I should spend MY birthday with her because she’s more important. Everything has to be about her anymore and if I even touch my phone when I’m with her, she flips shit. It lit up from a notification earlier and she about threw my phone. It’s breaking my mental health down to worse than it was. I’m hiding in the bathroom bawling. I can’t do it anymore. It’s breaking me. I’m not strong enough.

Edit: she found out I was on my phone and is going off on me outside the bathroom door",01Jun2020,2
1,"I don't remember most of this. I was about four when me and my mom moved in with her parents. I was super young so all I remember is me throwing a toy in my grandpa's eye and him yelling something at me.
Fast forward one year, I stuttered so much I was unintelligible. I went to a speech therapist everyday for a year. I speak normally know. All this time I thought it was just regular growing up stuff. Turns out my grandparents caused me to have so much stress I couldn't speak for a year after I left, and if my mom hadn't told me, I wouldn't have known. Ever. Thanks for the trauma guys",01Jun2020,2

6,When I was the little the sun and I where to say neutral but as I got older the more it annoyed me. I’ve always had mental health issues from biological parents and when with my step-mother it’s as though I have to walk on egg shells. But there is one place they wouldn’t go and that’s the darkness so I’ve always found happiness from the darkness it makes me feel great and alive like a burst of adrenaline. My parents say it is the reason I am depressed cause I never get sun and I’m always light headed I can’t argue with the light headed but that is also from blood related issues. My parents are always mad at me when I am in the darkness then when they invade my darkness and turn on the lights I lose control over my emotions I’ll either cry uncontrollably or when someone gets close to me I immediately prepare for a fight without control. I don’t know how to make my parents happy and be happy at the same time. I’ve tried to explain it. To me the darkness is like the sun to other humans. Am I weird?,01Jun2020,2

The question comes since the last time I got drunk it seems I just decided out of nowhere cut my self, superficially, I didn't mean to reach a vein or something as far as I remember, I don't really know what was I thinking since in general I feel pretty happy, complete and there are no suicidal or depressive feelings/thoughts while sober but still I feel a bit worried about that. However it is important to mention that I use to do stupid thinks while I'm not sober since I have done pretty dumb things in the past, not that.. umm, serious i guess, so some advice would be great, I personally decided to just go on and continue with my life as if nothing happened but I'm still interested on what other people would think of that situation.",01Jun2020,1

13,"tl;dr i have had daily panic attacks for a couple years now. Recentl, after finally distancing myself from my biggest sources of anxiety and finding a working ish lifestyle routine for my mental health, I'm starting to see results in the depresson and anxiety. And i want to point out i fully intend to continue that. However..

This week: as one of my best productive weeks I've had in a long time. This weekend: hey, remember that one time at a sleep over you felt so personally rejected by your friends that you couldn't sleep and spent the entire night and into the morning in their kitchen with a knife in your hand trying work up the courage to finally end it? 

Oh, that was almost fifteen years ago and this is the first time you remembered it in your entire adult life? 

Having these kind of memories come back in this way fully puts me in the emotional state of the memory . The rejection, self loathing, injustice. I've been sick to my stomach, boarderine panic attack since it surfaced. 

Why does my brain hold on to this stuff so well? It's like my brain sees that I'm recovered from the last recurring episode and decides now is the best time to heal the next one.

I think that right now, if you're like me, you don't really want to open up facebook, youtube, or even tiktok and see evidence of the craziness that humans are capable of. Those of us that struggle with mental health need to remind ourselves that we can't control most of what goes on. But, you can control what you allow yourself to watch, read, and listen to. Right now, you need to feel in control of your life. Do your dishes, take a shower, stretch, masturbate, do whatever you need to do to control what you can in your life. You don't have to stay up to date on the news every day. Your ""wokeness"" is not a priority. Being ""right"" about politics is not a priority. Doing the right thing is contingent upon your own health and security, so do what you can to take care of yourself instead of trying to point out and attack the things that are wrong with the world.",01Jun2020,1

20,"At the end of 2018 (September) a new school year began for me. I was severely depressed, anxious and suicidal. I had a very serious self harm issue that helped me keep my suicidal thoughts and plans in my head, instead of fulfilling them. Just to mention, my mother walked out on me when young so the attachment formed was with a female teacher.

I walked into an English class with this particular teacher and I just felt like I could trust her. She was open with the class and I appreciated it. My family was falling apart so I looked up to her. Dumb teenager admiration. Honestly, I was the student in the class to laugh at everything. Typically right? For a depressed teenager to try to laugh away the sadness.

In December 2018, I had cried in front of her due to stress from home. And at first, I felt like I could trust her, she was the first teacher ever to show me empathy instead of pity. So she was mostly a backup plan. A person who I knew I could go to if my thoughts became become tangible.

In February 2019, I had a panic attack in front of her and she helped me. I guess that's when it developed fully. The thought of 'If I kill myself, I won't be able to see Ms......'

And it made me form a very strong attachment to her, just wanting to be near her so I felt safe. It sounds very stupid, I know, but it was the only thing keeping me going. It was like I had to earn her affections and acknowledgements. My friends and family only spoke to out of duty, it felt like.

I thought about her all the time but when I was actually near her, I was a bumbling mess. Completely ridden with anxiety and guilt of disturbing her. 

Later in the year, I confided in her about self harm and suicidal thoughts and a little bit later, the abusive relationship I had with my dad. I had a few breakdowns in front of her.  

There is so much more she did for me but if I write it all, then It'd take too long to read. This is just the gist.

\-

We are still close and I go to her when I need help

But I need advice on how to become less attached with her. This is so I can move on. But its like I can't let go no matter how much I want to.",01Jun2020,1
21,"I've been trying to get rid of alcohol abuse and self depreciating thoughts for a few years now. The fight had ups and downs but in the end the situation can be summarized by moments of great optimism, courage and will to get better followed by moments of extreme self sabotaging, weakness and recklessness towards my goals and finally a feeling of frustration that gets bigger every time the cycle is complete.

It's like when my mind asks for the addiction, it will make me think any kind of excuse to surrender. ""Everybody is drinking on the isolation anyway, its not a big deal"", ""you're young and healthy, if there is a time to drink a lot, it is now"", ""all the musicians and characters you like also drink, you need to be just like them"". Stupid. Things like this, that are so stupid when I think about them in a sane state it gets me embarrassed sharing it.

But I need advice. How do I stop this voice, this ""me"" that convinces me to give up my fight to become healthy? I try and try, but I can't seem to be strong enough to think strait when the abstinence hits.

Hey everyone. Please read until the end. I know it’s long but bare with me. I’ve (20M) felt like shit for about a week. For some context I suffer from a few anxiety disorders and depression. I’ve gotten 85% or it under control to the point that people outside wouldn’t notice. Anyway, I’ve been trying to date for a while and have dated around. I’m looking for a serious relationship, as I’m not into the whole smash and dash thing. I want to love someone and be loved. Well, my ex broke up with me in March and got engaged to a guy in April that she dated for only 3 weeks. This crushed me. Although she never touched me, we still loved each other (we were both rape survivors which is why we never touched each other. I’m not triggered by physical stuff though) Since then I’ve tried to date two different women. One strung me along for 6 weeks. The other one was too wild for me but I stuck around for a bit because she was very good looking. Well, that ended badly and I’m at my wits end. I feel like I’m in a corner. I’m going to stop online dating, because that doesn’t work for me. I just feel so alone. I hate the single life. I miss having someone to share my life with. Someone to take around the country with me. I’ve worked on myself. I’ve gotten and finished Invisalign. I’m 6’1”. I have blond hair. I’m not obese (though I could lose a few pounds). I’m a computer scientist whose almost done with my degree. Im about to get plastic surgery on my chest. I have improved my social skills to the Point that I can shamelessly say anything. But I don’t know whats not to love. I get flirted with but it’s always women who put me on their endless list of phone numbers. I just feel like shit. Any advice?",01Jun2020,1

The number one problem with me is that I get told constantly my social interactions with people are very strange.

I tend to talk too much, talk over people, my memory isn’t very good...  

The reason why this is an issue is everyone I talk to thinks I am weird or on drugs (like I am on cocaine)...

Low dose (.5) of risperdal and this helped slightly but had a horrible effect on me making me very tired and it isn’t practical

# For the last 2 years, i've been in total isolation. away from people.

# and when i'm out, i don't wanna look at people bc they might make a face at me that puts me on edge. like they see me below them.

# i feel unwelcomed EVERYWHERE i go and feel like everyone hates me to the point to where i feel like i have to up the anti and do things, hurt myself, be extremely promiscuous just to be seen and throw myself into these garbage ass situations where everyone will hate me in the end.

I'm a bitch, i'm a retard, I'm toxic, i'm an attention whoring cunt.

31,"So I’ve been pretty athletic my whole life, used to play soccer basically my whole young adult life. But after high school I started smoking, drinking, taking any and all drugs all the time, I worked out but I never got anywhere aside from bigger muscles. I was ignorant, never put a label on much of my pain up until the other day. I’ve been a consistent addict with one thing or another, and I’ve always just been a scared, sad, extremely introverted person. I live on my own and have for the past year. 

I live in a college town so there’s plenty to do but while I pursue music as my career and i choose to not do anything besides work and do that. I’m 22, I haven’t gone out, gone to bars, I can’t talk to any even semi attractive girls, I get super tense walking through Walmart or crowded places, it’s because I’ve been judged so much my whole life, I always over think, and think anyone that interacts with me judges me as soon as they leave. 

I’ve played the persona that I’m tough, that I can handle anything, that I have a fuck everybody mentality but it just isn’t true, I get scared, I freak out in intense conflict and I can’t breathe in a heated argument. I was a pussy. A lot of it comes from my alcoholic mother who, for my whole childhood, chose the bar over me, and when I wanted time with her I got screamed at because of it. 

But, 3 weeks ago, I finally went through with it, I decided I didn’t want to be afraid anymore,  of anyone, or anything. I wanted to look my panic and depression and fear and weakness in its face and beat it. So I started running, and also taking very cold showers for a very long time. I’ve done both those things before but I always became inconsistent and inevitably stopped after a month at most. 

But I decided no more, I couldn’t spend my life this afraid, because something has always never been afraid inside of me, but I’ve never even tried to see it, maybe it’s because of my fear , maybe it’s the fear I have of having to go through my own purposeful suffering. 

I’ve ran and taken a cold shower consistently for 3 weeks so far. Started with 1 mile the first day, and about a 3 minute cold shower. I kept going up in miles and time in the cold shower. I realized an issue tho, I always stopped before the work even started. So I ran further, I sat in the cold until I was losing my mind convinced I was going to die. And then today came..... 

I decided I wanted to get an answer , about anything, so it was super hot, and I ran, and I ran and I ran and I ran, after about two miles I thought I was literally going to fall over and die of heat stroke, Mile 3 I had to puke and I was spacing out because of the heat, I’ve been running 4 miles everyday so I  said “it’s not worth dying to get an answer, so started heading back home” and then I said “no, otherwise nothing will change” I kept running, Mile 4 my legs were really heavy and pounding the pavement, it was like that for the next couple miles with the same convo happening in my head. “ go home” “no” yes no yes no 

Upon Mile 8, now pay attention. I KNEW I wasn’t going to be Able to keep running all the way home, I was going to have to walk, but about .5 miles till my front door, I got an answer and here it is. (Sorry for the long post btw) 

I’ve convinced myself of who I am, without even attempting to see what I’m capable of. That I’m only afraid bc deep down, this is what I was capable of, that even tho I thought I KNEW I couldn’t make it with over a mile to go.. I made it, but yet I KNEW I couldn’t, so how do I KNOW that I’m afraid? How do I KNOW I’m introverted? How do I KNOW I’m afraid of conflict. How do I KNOW I’m afraid of fear. How do I KNOW anything without trying, really, really, know... and I guess if I’m being honest I’m still afraid, but I’m a little less afraid now, but I’m going to continue to try and try to be less afraid and really know who I am. Thats what I figured out, is though that moment didnt work a miracle or my life is suddenly different. But then again maybe it did, because now I know what I need to do, I need to try.",01Jun2020,2

i constantly make the same mistakes over and over again, but i don’t do it purposefully. i don’t understand why i don’t learn the first few times from my mistakes. it’s frustrating. trying my hardest seems like little to no effort to those around me. it’s always “well if you try harder, if you just listened, if you just got your shit together you’d do this”. 

“maybe if you woke up earlier”, well getting out of bed isn’t always easy. 

“if you try harder”, well i’m trying my fucking hardest and you telling me to try harder makes me feel worthless. 

“just get your shit together”, i’m trying, i promise!!

36,"Apologies in advance for the long post. I never thought I'd have to post somewhere like here, but I don't know what to do anymore.

Seeing how things are going in the world today... it's hard to hold on to the belief that things will get better. People just don't seem to care about others. I get that lockdown is impacting everyone differently. People want their freedom back. But why are we, as a species, so weak that we're willing to effectively kill people for our own emotional state?

Compound unto this the riots going on right now, which are not only highlighting the ugly truth that the US has, and likely always will be, fundamentally divided, but providing another vector for the disease to spread, and I find it hard to have the willpower to keep going. It's over. We lost. We're doomed to keep hating each other and consequentially marching closer to our inevitable demise, for that's how we've always operated.

The scary thing, I realize, is that I know the last two paragraphs are an extreme of what's going on in the world. I feel like I'm stuck in my own head, this echo chamber of despair. That the world is ending, when it may not be. But I could also be going crazy, I guess.

To pay for school, I go to a manufacturing job every day with people seemingly apathetic towards the state of the world. I've seen the way all of my coworkers are dismissive towards anything I say. I'm pretty sure that they all hate me, and to some extent, I've fortunately stopped caring for their opinions. Nobody likes talking to the kid who doesn't fit the narrative of ""go to work, go home and watch sports and drink, repeat it all the next day"". Nobody cares to learn about people different than them. Nobody cares to face the reality of what's going on. Rather than discussing how we can help the world, we pretend the problems don't exist.

I feel like school is the only real structure in my life, but even hopes for that are looking slim for the Fall. I just joined a team helping to develop open-source respirator equipment, but that brings me back to my original question- can we really beat this? How many people are going to die? How many people I love are going to die? And why does nobody care?

None of this feels real. I don't know what's going to happen going forward. I think, for the first time in my life, I feel true terror. 

I don't want baseless reassurance from friends and family. I want solutions. I want some way to protect the people I care about and those who can't afford to protect themselves, and if that's not possible, part of me just wants someone to put a bullet in my head so that I don't need to look at this selfish society ever again.

When im with my family I'm the annoying but loving middle child with a bit of charm and a complete mommas boy.  When it's just me and my dad, I tend to be more curious about things like how certain processes work or hypotheticals about stuff that I think would be useful to know.  When I'm in class without any friends I'm the quiet and reserved ""speak when spoken to"" type.  But most importantly, when I'm by myself I feel empty.  I get bored very easily and have severe emotional numbness and want to be constantly isolated.  I constantly feel like a spectator in my own life and never really feel happy for the great life I live.  I feel like I'm a story without any real importance, and without purpose.  I constantly feel like I'm out of my own skin and never wanting to do anything unless I'm told to or to just pass the time with menial subjects like tv and videogames.  Does anyone else have this problem, or any solutions?  I feel incredibly self conscious but I'm never able to show it, hence why I just try to blend in with everything.

49,"Hello friends! Here’s a little background about me.

I had very good early childhood until my parents were divorced when I was 5. Even though I was the lucky kid since I could get to spend time with my mom and dad everyday until I turned 18,  Ive been experiencing bullying not only by peers, especially boys, but also teachers. I’ve been having mental issues since childhood, and I’ve been always wanting to be normal just like everyone else, especially when I was in special ed class until high school. When I was 8, my dad married to my first stepmother (not anymore thankfully), and she hates me since day 1. She claimed that she’s a Christian, but I was extremely abused by her. I had, still have, hard time making friends through my K-12 years, and I had no choice but to be someone I’m not. I started to please people, and I don’t get to know who I really am. I’ve been overweight my lifetime, and because of this, I was bullied terribly by boys which caused me to never trust guys nor make guy friends. Thus, I never had a boyfriend until I was 18, still single as of now. I chose the wrong college major, as I should’ve majored in computer science instead of psychology. I have a part time job, and I’ve been looking for full time but no offer, nor given an interview. I don’t have a driver’s license, but I have a learner’s permit. My mom refused to let me practice driving with her ever since I turned 16. I can’t afford driving lessons, no family wants to help me get licensed, and I refused to stay over my dad’s since we’re estranged due to having conflicts with my current stepmother. Recently, I’ve become more jealous of almost everyone’s success, especially when my niece [17] gotten her driver’s license last year [16], which I should’ve gotten mines way before her, not the other way around. I can’t get Medicaid since where I live doesn’t expand it. I’ve been wanting to seek therapy and get medications from psychiatrist, but I can’t afford it. In addition, I have no goals, therefore I suck at saving money. I’ve been fooled by man, who I thought was the one, ghosted me since we hooked up last month. I still have trust issues with everyone, including myself. I refused to accept compliments because I’m so used to getting criticized. When a guy calls me beautiful, I would tell him that I don’t believe him because I  would think that he’s being insincere. I don’t necessarily have suicidal thoughts, but I’m depressed because I missed out on every opportunity I should’ve taken in my entire lifetime. I’ve been living with regrets, jealousy, and misery because all of these terrifying events prevents me from changing myself and focusing on present.

Please do not judge me because I’ve been judged hard enough.",01Jun2020,2
50,"While the thought of dying while asleep or having nightmares is scary, neither of those are the main reasons I'm afraid of it.

It's simply the fact that when you sleep, you are unconscious. You are no longer there. It's incomprehensible, and I think that's why I am so afraid of it. It's like being dead, but only for 8 hours.

Usually it just keeps me awake from anywhere between 15 minutes to an hour, and I eventually get so tired I don't really care anymore and stop thinking about it. I usually don't have trouble staying asleep either.

Last night though, I just couldn't get myself to sleep. I ended up falling asleep at 10 in the morning, ironically after I decided to just wait till the next night to sleep.

This whole thing has been really bothering me. The thought of being unconscious is terrifying to me, not because you could die during it or anything, but just the fact that I'm gone during sleep. 

It's a pretty new problem, it's only been going on for a week or two. When I was younger (I'm 17 right now) I used to deal with insomnia, but that was years ago and I've never really had an issue with sleep since then.

Part of it is I assume due to my completely fucked up sleep schedule; I usually fall asleep at 6 AM and wake up at 4 PM. This started pretty much because since the start of the quarantine.",01Jun2020,1

55,"This is kinda random but I just need to tell someone. I’ve been having OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) symptoms since I was young but never thought anything of it until recently. I knew I was a little different and thought differently but like most thought that OCD meant you wanna be clean and away from germs all the time. My symptoms make me feel guilt for inanimate objects like food crumbs or rocks or even numbers some times. I also feel like I always have to move my body a certain way like clear my throat when there’s nothing to clear or most of the time move my shoulders and head in circles or side to side. I really hate it. 

Earlier on when I researched OCD, I felt kinda alone so I decided to tell my dad about it. It did not go well. He just laughed about it and then told my stepmom and they kept denying it and saying it was all in my head. For a while I did believe it was all in my head. I felt like I had a burden on me until today. I was feeling really bad so I took some extra time in the shower to just be alone. I had completely forgotten that I promised my mom I would go downstairs and hang out with her after a “quick shower”. I was in the shower for probably about an hour. She was really mad because she though I just didn’t want to hang out with her. I literally just burst out crying. At this point we were both mad so we took some time and then talked. That’s when I told her about the OCD symptoms I’ve been experiencing. She was super chill about it and I had nothing to be afraid of in the first place. We are going to do more research because I definitely want to get properly diagnosed. I feel better than I have in a long time.

I’m 19 and as my classes get harder, it becomes harder to keep up with work. I have been diagnosed with moderate anxiety and depression, but also asthma and mild anemia. I am currently trying to see different doctors about fatigue-related medical conditions. I also have extreme “brain fog”. I used to be really good about memorizing things and critical thinking, but now I could set down my phone and then lose it 2 seconds later. I’m so young, I shouldn’t have this much loss of cognitive function.

I was also considered naturally talented at music and the arts. WHAT HAPPENED? Yeah, I hated school and studying, but it’s not like I neglected training my brain. I still loved reading and researching and analyzing things (which I would do in my free time). The only difference to me is that I would actually care about the subject. However, I digress. I still love reading, but whenever I open a book or my Kindle, I get so tired just thinking about it that I close it and take a nap. If you ask me to do something off the top of my head, I blank and then cry because I get embarrassed. I’ve started to think I’m just incredibly stupid because I can’t do anything without being tired. I’m mentally burnt out and I don’t know how to recover. I’m just wondering if this is a condition? I heard about chronic fatigue syndrome and it sounds similar, but I don’t know what to do for that. Any advice or suggestions on how to help?

TL:DR any kind of conscious brain activity makes me tired- thinking, reading, talking etc. I’ve avoided so many things I like because I don’t want to feel any more tired than I already do.

When I was little I useto see what I can knly know describe as complete hallucinations. They went away, and trust me I know the difference between imagination and hallucinations. I would hear people whispering and I would see literal monsters, and without a double take could stare at them and see them run away etc.. I would have paranoia as well. I dont feel like I need to go into ultra detail.

Over time it went away, and I've never had anything like that above the age of 9 or so. Being a child most my claims of monsters were always laughed at, and it wasn't a super big deal anyway, so it was never seriously investigated. 

For these reasons I was terrified of the dark. And have been for years. I would still have paranoid episodes of thinking people are following me etc. Or there is a monster trying to kill me, but no straight up hallucinations, just shadow figures etc., and I was like this until about 16. This started to wither away and I lost my fear of the darkness.

At 18 years old now, I still see things at night and have paranoid thoughts, but am able to recognize that I'm just being a retard.

65,"I don't know if this is the right place for this, but I thought I'd talk about it anyway.

For a large portion of my life I've had pretty bad anger issues, with a tendency to go 0-100 for very little reason at all, even since the age of 8, when I was first put on a child anger management program (was done in my primary school during breaks). This for a while I was able to control, with only having very minor and uncommon outbursts with the only notable one between 8-14 was jolting my mum's steering wheel while on the way home from school, luckily her managing to pull it back before hitting anyone - I'm not quite sure what triggered this to begin with. From 14, my overall mood and temper started to get further and further out of control, with the first times I started shouting and screaming in anger, and when my first feelings of depression began to set in. 

The first outbursts in this time were minor at first, but slowly got worse and worse up until I was 15, where I first started damaging things and myself. At first, I used to slam my desk while doing homework if I got stuck on a question, even if i was calm or happy before it, and then slowly moved on to full on punching my freezer, which has caused a few broken knuckles and fracturing my wrist a few times. During this time, I somehow got into a relationship, which very quickly turned emotionally abusive. The girl would generally treat me like shit, ignore me for days and then convince me it was my fault, cheat on me and then say it was because of something I did, etc. For some reason, I believed this for 9 months until I finally just blocked her out without a word. After this, my anger became worse and worse and more frequent, with now more depressive thoughts and anxiety. I had a few close friends during this time that supported me through the rough relationship, who tried to pull me out of it but I ignored. After all this happened, half the friends that were there for me  I either blocked out or they stopped talking to me. 

After all of that, I began to just feel empty, not angry or depressed, just like I didn't really exist. I don't think I talked to anyone outside of my pre-established  friend group or counselling services for nearly 5 months. All the counselors I did try either vanished and stopped turning up to sessions or just were generally pretty useless. My anger had gone, but i had also mostly stopped showing emotions to people. I made a few more shitty friends after that, and had a girlfriend again which wasn't really eventful, just moved on from each other. After a few more events and the move from high school to college I didn't have any friends left, at all. 
I struggled to make any new friends in college because of the anxiety that remained from my first girlfriend, and a fear I'll end up being abused and mistreated like I was before, however I managed to make a few which I never ended up being close with. 

Finally, at 17, I ended up getting another girlfriend, this time, I was happy. We both spent a lot of time together, nearly 8 hours a day, and were both always there for each other. It went on for 3 months like this,  with us both being really close throughout. It was the first time id ever felt happy and the first time id actually felt like I mattered, I ended up making loads of friends, losing weight, getting in shape etc. Then, one day, for a reason I still have no idea about, she just broke up with me, out of the blue. We still spoke for a while, but it wasn't the same, and it was the most depressed I'd been ever. After a while, my anger started to come back again, and this time at myself and everyone around me. For the past 2 months I've felt scared that I was going to hurt myself, my family or someone around me, and having the only output of my anger being punching a freezer so much that the door completely warped and didn't seal anymore. Whenever someone annoys me, all I can think about is hurting them, which having to genuinely hold myself back so not to assault them. 

I have no idea where to turn or what to do anymore, I've been like this for 4 months strong now.

I don't really know the reason that is leading me to post this but I just need to get it out somehow.

My name is Jim, I'm 32 and a week ago I was ready to kill myself. I had been drinking every day for a week and almost every day for years. But I went especially hard for the weekend. I woke up on Monday, remembered who I was, drank from the half bottle of rum on my kitchen bench and ran a bath. I sat in that bath and called a few people - my brother, my sister and my oldest friend. I wanted to talk to them one last time but they figured out what I was doing. 

I moved from my home country to where I am now in February. It was supposed to be my fresh start but only I knew the real plan. I was going to stay for a month or two then leave. I was going to run somewhere nobody could find me. I was going to die somewhere I couldn't be found. This virus fucked all that up for me. 

Back to Monday. The people I talked to called eachother and then contacted the local police to do a welfare check. They found me drunk in my bath and took me to hospital. From there I was placed in a secure mental health unit. I was interviewed many times and honestly they did a fantastic job but I convinced them it was all a misunderstanding and they let me leave Wednesday. 

Since then I haven't felt anything. I haven't talked to anyone. I don't even want to drink anymore and am 7 days sober. I can't talk to my family anymore because I can't get past the shame. I feel no hope. I'm dead already. 

I can't remember a time in my life when I was actually happy. I have maintained a decent facade for everyone until the last few years but I've always felt the darkness right inside me just below the surface. There are too many things I need to forget. 

I was sexually abused as a child. This is the first time I have every said that or typed that anywhere. I can't face it.  I can only now see how much it affected every aspect of my life. I feel worthless. I have no self esteem. I have ruined relationships with amazing people in the past through my own inablitily to be honest with myself. 

I know people would tell me to get help, to talk to someone. I don't want help. I think there's something seriously wrong with me and it scares me too much. I can't talk about my life, I've tried. It has been enjoyable at times of course, but I can never really be at peace. I know there is no way I can. I don't want medication and I can't talk.

Something I have heard people say that resonates with me is the feeling of wanting to go home but not being able to find it.  I'm just so tired. I'm all alone now but I kind of like it. No one has to think about me now. I don't know what happens next but I know I don't have much strength left. 

""I need a crowd of people, but I can't face them day to day
My problems are meaningless, but that don't make them go away""

73,"Hi anyone that reads this.

I (34m) have been married to my wife (30f) for 4 years, we have been together 12 years and have 3 children.

At the start of lockdown we were on a group chat with her friends and while she left the room i was behind the camera so no one knew i was there. ( i was sat at the opposite side of the table, not eavesdropping). 
I overheard her friends discussing that she had a threesome with our 2 closest friends while i was asleep on the sofa a couple of weeks before lockdown.

I have confronted her about it and she is obviously denying it all saying it was 3 other people and not her. 

I have a long history of paranoia depression and hallucinations, which i have weekly conversations with my GP about. 

This feels different! Im certain i heard it correctly but given my history i cannot trust my own ears or thoughts (if that makes sense??)

Naturally the 1st thing anyone in their right mind would say is you have to leave. Although this poses a serious threat to my mental wellbeing.

I have no social life . .  At all! I lost contact with all my old friends when my family moved away a year before meeting my wife.
I have no one to talk to about any of this as the only people i could talk to are supposedly involved. 

Now i am finding the voices are getting louder and more agressive (in my head). I am desperately trying to stay strong for my kids and wife but this is proving difficult.

I can't lose everything again! I have been having very strong urges to end my life.

The point is, i genuinely can't tell if i have had sone sort of elaborate delusion ( as i have many times before) or if this has actually happened. 
I want to see my kids grow up and tuck them in at night, i really dont want to die. I just dont see an alternative.

Please help! Anyone. . .",01Jun2020,1
74,"I don't feel at home at home. For reference I'm a transgender (Male to female) 16 year old. My dad always drank, treated me like a piece of shit, and emotionally abused me. Luckily my mom didn't let him physically abuse me because that was ""Too far"" and she'd leave him (As she's the primary provider that would have been bad for him). 

Well my mom stopped him from hitting me physically she did very little for what he did emotionally. She always pretended like nothing happened. 

However a few months ago I was gonna kill myself but my friend called the cops and I was hospitalized for 3 days. My dad had agreed to stop drinking and treat me better. Everyone on the room (My mom, dad, and brother) where giving me a look saying I needed to say something and I knew what they wanted to hear. ""I'll give our relationship another shot"" I said. I knew I was lying. 

I'm a forgiving ass person btw. Like I forgive EVERYONE seriously! He's dead as a the only time I've ever decided fuck it. I'm not forgiving you. You're not worth my time. So eventually after time passed and I wasn't giving him leeway my mom confronted me. She yelled and screamed at me for not forgiving calling me a problem. Quite frankly she brought back my suicidal thoughts. I had already been in a downward spiral but she really triggered me. When I'm called a problem I feel like I'd be better off gone because then the problems gone right?

Also I feel it's important to note he *has* been drinking again recently. Just nothing hard so it's fine in both of their eyes. And his treatment if me is getting worse. Again. 

Am I really the problem? Am I doing something wrong by not forgiving him? Please... Help me...",01Jun2020,1

76,"“What is situational depression like?” you may wonder to yourself if you’ve ever heard of it. The good part and hard part is I am writing this during a “depressive episode” as I call it. I am writing as I feel myself starting to spiral deeper into it and I have the power and willpower to pull myself out of it because I’ve worked incredibly hard to create that strength inside of myself, and situational depression is VERY different from clinical depression or major depression or other kinds of depression. They are relatively brief EPISODES or EXPERIENCES of moderate to severe depression. I do not know the clinical definition but will include it at the end. This is MY personal, lived experience ONLY of it. 

I am currently living with my parents during the pandemic, the pandemic being relevant to everyone’s mental health not to mention my own mother’s depression and anxiety issues. I have been living with them for three years as I worked part-time and did pre-requisites for my graduate program which I got into in March, one week before the pandemic hit… It is supposed to start the last week of September. I am currently unemployed and not getting unemployment because my first, second and third applications have never been approved despite entering accurate information and addresses, etc. I was supposed to be substitute teaching all this spring semester and all of August onward. Now I do not know if I will have a job. I only have $2000 saved for moving. I was meant to have $5000 saved to pay for the entire semester and have a big buffer in case of issues with subbing &amp; being a full-time graduate student, as well as winter break which is 4ish weeks in length… 

Situational depression is very selfish, and hard. It is a spiral because you know it is selfish which only fuels the shame that started the depressive episode and therefore you spiral deeper and deeper into self-loathing and self-hate. 

I got into a fight with my parents because they said I made a blanket statement when I did not. At first I was very angry with them because they often accuse me of things or put words in my mouth that are not true or what I meant. This has happened my entire life and cuts straight to the small child inside of me feeling unloved always. She never feels good enough. When she comes out and starts devouring my attention, soul, and heart, it is like a knife cutting through my chest. I start to have tears well up in my eyes. Sometimes I start to think about suicide even though I know it would hurt my family deeply if I killed myself and I know even more so that I don’t truly want to die, nor do I want to hurt them further than I already do by existing as a complete and total failure. 

As I decided to write some letters this late evening I started to think about how I had not written letters in awhile and how it sounded almost like a good-bye. I then started thinking, “is that what I am doing? Am I subconsciously saying good-bye to my family and loved ones?” It wasn’t but I briefly wondered about it and wasn’t so sure if it would be such a bad thing if I were dead. 

I feel like a failure. I’ll be 27 in a couple months and just ended a three year long relationship in which we had seriously talked about living together. I am starting a graduate program and I feel like a complete fraud. I feel like an imposter, imposter syndrome? I do not feel I deserve to be in the program. All I feel like is a fat, lazy, stupid, loud-mouthed, foolish, immature, poorly spoken, ignorant, can NEVER SHUT UP idiot. I feel like this very often. I have tried self-help books and therapy. I have tried happiness classes, exercising, and meditation and ASMR, and a lot. I know it helps a little bit and I know CONSISTENCY is key to making a difference. That is the problem with situational depression. I am a FAILED PERFECTIONIST. I hate being such an utter pathetic and stupid failure but I cannot be consistent in change, or tidiness, or organization or ANYTHING. It is a really sad and stupid life to live but I cannot let go of my perfectionism completely and I cannot seem to actually make any consistent changes to my personality, brain, body, etc.

It’s especially selfish to feel this way during a pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests happening across the world. I am not Black. I am not “poor” because of my parents even if I myself am “low-income.” I am not experiencing racism in general let alone institutionalized and systemic racism. I hate that I know this and I know it’s selfish and stupid. I know that I am so blessed and privileged and lucky. I know that I should have gratitude and just GET ON WITH LIFE AND HELP OTHER PEOPLE. It’s just really hard to do that when you spiral. It’s funny because sometimes I \*almost\* feel like the description of another mood disorder like bipolar disorder but just in more SLOW motion. Like I can go from days or weeks or months of solid contentment and effort and then just one BIG mistake or fight or something bigger like that can STILL make me spiral. The spirals are briefer and less deeper than before therapy and the years of effort I gave and still give to working with my situational depression. Back then it could last days or weeks or longer and was a lot more self-destructive. It was heavy self-hatred when I was a teen/early twenties, often buried underneath the surface of normalcy and day-to-day life. 

I could ramble for days but I am pulling myself out of the spiral and back to feeling more normal. Maybe this helped, I don’t know.

I tolerated this for 4 whole years. When I graduated, I cried and cried on the way home because I knew I would never have to see this person ever again. They still tried to reach out to me right after graduation but I never replied to them. Thankfully they got the point and stopped talking to me, yet the scar has never healed and to this day I am constantly checking this person’s social media.

But when it comes to his own feelings, he results to cutting off everyone and thinking to himself. So a couple of days ago he got back from a camping trip for his birthday. And a bit before that and during it we were arguing quite a bit. But when he got back he asked if we could take a pause or break on our relationship. I convinced him not and we went to bed kinda normal but on a weird term, he just said “I just need to think, I’ll text you tomorrow”. And then he didn’t text me for 2 days and left me on open and delivered. The same with my friend that was also concerned. I had a complete mental BREAKDOWN. But besides that, I told him a bunch of stuff like “I want you to talk to me about what’s going on” and all that, letting him know that I care and want to help. But nothing. But about 12 hours later i texted him that i couldn’t do this anymore and i need him to help me to understand what is happening because i truly had no idea what was going on. Then he texted me explaining everything. But i’ll try and explain this as short as possible...
Basically he felt that our relationship was going to shit. He has a lot of female friends and this one girl, Anna, is a person he goes to talk to about his problems a lot because she “understands his head” is what he said. I told him i don’t like her because before we started dating, we all hung out and she was always on him and hugging him and touching him. So i knew she liked him in some way. So he said since he wanted to talk to her, he got it mixed up in his head and thought that he had feelings for her. (to let you know we are are teens so I understand the whole teenager feels). He said he thought about it and asked for a break because he wanted to figure out what he wanted to do because he didn’t know if he liked her, but still really liked me. But then he said he just didn’t answer any texts and didn’t really realize he was ignore and cutting everyone off. He says that’s the only way he knows how to deal with his problems. I get that and he has a family that’s always up his ass with everything, but I want him to open up to me. I want to be the person that “understands his head” the best. Because he has his best friend Aiden and then that girl Anna. Those two people help him. I want to be one of those people. I don’t know how to help.

83,"Throwaway because I don't feel comfortable with my main.

I have been struggling with mental health for the past two to three years. Probably even before, but I used to just shrug and tell myself that ""it was nothing"" (I am notorious for a certain lack of self awareness when it comes to feelings). Basically, I have zero self esteem, difficulty in coping with my feelings, along with a sensation of utter discomfort when I consider that, to me, life has no meaning, everything is dull and I have no purpose and no will to do anything, usually for weeks on end, even if with some bright spots.

Recently, my life is getting progressively worse (I am at uni, already late at graduating and I am unable to study. Every time I try to, I get anxious and procrastinate and end up hating myself even more. I made up my mind to go and see a therapist, to sort things out and start feeling less miserable.

85,"I started my exam panicking and experienced what people often told me were anxiety attacks where my heart rate increased rapidly, have lightheadedness and deep and frequent breaths. The first one I calmed down fairly quickly at the start. The second one lasted for half an hour after I came back from a toilet break. I didn't know what to do. Evidence? How do I provide evidence? I'm alone in my room, I didn't want to alert an invigilator because I felt like I didn;t have evidence. The question wasn't too hard, just a bit weird,manageable, and doable, but I over spent time on it, even when I told myself to just skip to the next one, I didn;t. Honestly, I almost just left with my paper half finish. 

Honestly I don't even know.  I practically flunked two test already. and the safety net policy isn't much of anything. 

HOnestly, when I think about it. I do have anxiety attacks once or twice per exam season. but I never alerted the invigilator because I'd always think that it was my fault, that this is because of lack of preparation, but the panic really caused me to not be able to focus on anything.

91,"I'm new to Reddit as a poster so I feel I should give some backstory here.

Backstory:

I am female, 21. I work full time as a content writer for technology in an IT company (SEO milking type). I am also a full-time design student in my second year.  

Initially, I wanted to focus on my studies and university was very important to me - in a field I am genuinely passionate about. However, last year of high school my mom (only parent) had cancer, so I had to postpone uni by a year. I got a job and supported myself and my family as much as I can. I still do.

 I started uni in 2018. For two years, I have juggled 15 subjects workload per semester with a lot of practical projects and deadlines. And I have also been working full time. So my average day would be.. going out at 7 for lectures and working till 10 at night. (In quarantine it is different of course, but the workload is the same).

I also had a pretty manipulative narcissistic ex (7 yrs), that was obsessive and controlling: from food, working out, social life, habits, uni, work etc. The relationship really chipped away at my sanity, sense of self-worth and generally became the lowest point of my life, mentally last two years.  I broke up with him before the quarantine. 

Now: 

In the next few weeks, I have an insane workload to cover if I want to pass my exams. And additionally, at work, they are constantly raising expectations for what I am supposed to turn in - I am also paid the bare minimum, while the workload is for two. The switch between two different fields (marketing writing and design), both intellectual tasking is exhausting. The last few weeks, I have been having trouble falling asleep or waking up. I also notice old habits of emotional binge-eating from when my ex tried to control my food (that led to weight gain and even lower self-esteem). I feel distracted, I can't focus neither on work, uni, hobbies, training... nothing. I feel shitty a lot of the time, I get constant headaches (residue from past concussion, yey...) and I feel guilty because I am so fucking far behind on all of my work. Feels like I am drowning. I'm also fairly irritable to  family because of it - even tho they are insanely supportive.

So.. does anyone have any tips on how I can go through the rough patch? I have plans to take a step back from work (half-time + freelance when I can) starting in October, with the support of my sister. Or at least taking a design job so I can be focused on one field. But it is not an option by then (my family relies on me heavily for necessities), I need to keep my current job - which I hate more and more by the day. I can't afford to take a step back on uni either..I have to take all my exams, or I won't be able to take some very important classes next year.

Do you have any tips on how I can take care of my health while grinding away at my responsibilities? Aside from, water, eating healthier and exercise - I already try to do all that, along with prioritized sleep.

92,"I am 15 years old and I need help identifying whether I am being emotionally abused at home by my mom. Background: I was hit and screamed at a lot when I was younger and my parents cuss very frequently, especially my mom (my dad in fact calls her a psycho and crazy b*tch because of it)
Today's incident: (extremely triggering I am sorry. If you are afraid of having emotional flashbacks over this please don't read ahead)

My mom wanted me to help with her computer software but I didn't feel like it. So she got really mad and started screaming and saying things that provoked me (such as that I will never be happy and that my personality will drive people away in school) so I told her I was leaving the house temporarily. When I tried to leave she grabbed me, hit me and then dragged me to scream at me. I kept trying to leave during this but she slammed the door so that I couldn't do so, kept pulling me by the arm and throwing things at me when I tried to get away, and hit me again. She said things which may be considered gaslighting (that I hurt her and mock her even though I really don't, that I want her dead and won't feel a thing when she dies.) kept yelling at me what went wrong with her parenting of me. Keep in mind I said nothing throughout this entire interaction and was trying to keep as stoic as possible. She also said that if I find her parenting extreme or wrong I should just become more resourceful and less sensitive. She was cussing and using bad language throughout this ENTIRE interaction. When I broke down in front of her she started screaming at me louder.

This seems to be emotional abuse but my mom isn't always like this. When she's calm she compliments me and shows me affection. I'm really conflicted. Please give your opinion.",01Jun2020,1

I feel like everything I do is just a nail my coffin. I can't afford therapy or consulting and I only have two friends in my town and talking to them about my problems is not helping at all I finally came to realize and accept that I'm alone in this. My focus has dropped, my reading skills decreased, I went from writing whole pages in minutes to not be able to write a single paragraph and even my English became so poor because I haven't read any English book in 2 years. I live with my family in a beautiful small town but I'm isolated from the local society and I'm almost like a shadow here lurking around with only some people on the way to lighten up my darkness. In August I'll be 24 realizing that another year have passed not having done nearly anything I wanted. Because I'm a loser, I ditch my responsibilities, cut off from the social world, not able to sit nicely and complete my tasks, unable to be decent and actually finish something.

Hell is not other people, hell is where other people might be living. Hell is to have a 40 inches plasma screen, a new phone, and a robust laptop but no life to enjoy them. To possess everything yet to have nothing. To have some good things in life yet a soul that doesn't know how to cherish them. It's when you used to be loving and caring and you get emotional everytime you see injustice or some fellow human being suffering but now you can't feel a thing because the domain in which you used to find compassion and sympathy became the domain in which you see how life have crushed you and threw you in a dirty alley like some old rug. Hell is not other people, Sartre said that because he believed that people will look at you and judge you forcing you into being.

I guess therapy. I guess that's what you do, right? I don't want to go on medication. I've had really bad experiences with that in the past. The psych ward would make me worse. The crowding, the isolation. Those aren't places you go to get better, and they're really bad on trans people generally. I think it would make things worse.

98,"Hello, I am a master's student at the University of Hull, UK.

I am hoping to recruit participants to take part in my online study. The study is trying to find out how different temporary mindsets (called 'schema modes') link with wellbeing. Previous studies have found that people with eating disorders may experience more unhelpful mindsets than usual. Also, that 'Schema Therapy', which deals with these mindsets, could be useful for helping this group of people. The results of this study will be important to support the assessment of the schema modes of people with eating disorders, which could then help Schema Therapy to treat eating disorders.

To be eligible to take part, you must be 18+ and have had an eating disorder diagnosis.

Please follow the link to the survey for the full details. [https://hull.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/edschemamodesandwellbeing](https://hull.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/edschemamodesandwellbeing)

100,"I’m a 28yo male who was diagnosed with autism when I was 6, and at this point in my life I’m really struggling to comprehend society or how I’m expected to feel like I fit in when all I’ve ever faced is adversity and contempt towards the way I am and the way I think.

I just don’t know what I’m here for, I mean, it’s not like I haven’t tried to fit in,l or find myself in this world, I worked in the security industry for just short of a decade I broke so many boundaries around my comfort zones to do so, but due to the laziness and corruption of the people I worked for (in every company, just the industry as a whole) i can’t bring myself to strive towards doing my job without hating myself for not doing something to it’s best potential like they trained me to, because any time i have ever tried to do that I just get fired eventually. 

I have a big interest in gaming but frankly the reason I don’t stream is because of the way autism is viewed by society, I’m definitely one of the more socially capable people with autism, most people can’t even tell because I’ve put so much work into my presentation and mannerisms. I just can’t see that as a career or option for those reasons. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore tbh, I don’t know what my career should be, or even who I am in this world. because everything I stand for, truth, honesty, integrity, this world just doesn’t seem to care about it anymore, it’s all about capitalism and being rich, core human values are fading but I’m not the type of person who can change with the times like that, my mind and heart won’t let me, my belief and focus in what’s right and logical is too strong to be corrupted or waver, 

I tried to kill myself numerous times from the age of 23 up until last year, the mental pressure and resulting depression I felt was enormous because my time in education when I was younger was very short, I was always seen as a problem child and constantly expelled when all I wanted to do was learn and sponge information they couldn’t give me because I had to wait until my next semester when it was appropriate and scheduled to be taught, this constantly annoyed me, i was there to learn but they wouldn’t teach me instead removing me so I wasn’t a problem, sticking me in isolation in an underground learning unit like a criminal, so without qualifications I have no career prospects in any industry except the one I’m trained in, all I have is who I am and what I’ve achieved, however irrelevant that may be, and in this day and age that isn’t good enough to succeed anymore. so what am I supposed to do? I just honestly don’t know.

I don’t know if there are any fellow adults here with autism but I could honestly do with the opinion and guidance of one because I feel like I’m alone on this and nobody I meet or know can give me answers or help me find clarity because they don’t understand. 

I want to do better in life and feel better about myself, I just don’t know how. 

I don’t really share my thought process much for obvious reasons, but I need to get past this brick wall holding me back or i will never succeed at anything.

101,"**Hi girls and boys.** 

This may not be the correct sub but I need some advice. 

So, I find myself thinking almost constantly ( some days ) about losing my mind and not being able to control my body and in the end, jumping off from my balcony? (I live on the 16th floor) 

I’m not even suicidal. I don’t want to kill myself but I’m constantly scared of losing control and then unconsciously killing myself. 

I don’t know if it’s a common thing or if I need to get therapy. Although I feel better when I’m around people because my head likes to believe that if I lose control, they might stop me from killing myself!? 

There are smaller things that scare me Like, thinking I might be capable of unconsciously throwing my phone out of the car. 

More context: whenever I take a shower or whenever I’m in a locked room, I imagine the worst possible things. 

For example: I hear my mom crying and yelling. (hallucinations!?) 

Should I get professional help? Or is it a normal thing that’ll pass in a while?",01Jun2020,1
102,"I don’t know where to start with this but here goes. Since late last year the world’s just been shit and now I’m having to be the peacekeeper at home as tensions are now growing amongst family.

I live with my family to help out since mum’s cancers and all the treatments she went through. My brother is meant to be her carer and is payed good money to do so but would rather just smoke weed all day and ignore everyone else including his own kid. He’s actually so much of an asshole we’re all happy when he goes to his mate’s/dealer’s place to smoke and blow most of his government payment on weed to bring back home and smoke all day everyday. Every time I try to bring up the fact he’s an addict I just get shot down and just have to deal with him being an asshole. And when he’s out I’m the one who mum vents to about him, then when I go to she just gets upset at me and makes me feel like the prick. I’m constantly walking on eggshells around everyone because one wrong word and it’ll explode.

I’ve dealt with depression on and off since I was a teenager and I feel trapped between forcing myself to keep it together and the family ripping itself apart.

Then there’s been the constant shitty state of the world for the past 6 months, between the bushfires, covid and now the protests. I’ve lost count at how many times if almost cried watching the news. I’ve had family and friends in a few countries affected by them. I feel so small and isolated and just scared for people I know, but feel guilty for living in somewhere that had almost no direct impact from them.

I had a friend die in a car accident last week and I literally can’t even bring myself to start processing those feelings. But the other day I got to listen to two family members read out loud the rant that someone who knew him wrote on publicly Facebook saying they were glad he died. For over an hour, knowing I was in the next room and could hear them, calling out to me asking questions about him. So can’t wait to open up that box of feelings at some point.

I realise every just writing this I’m getting angry, but there’s more.

So I’ve barely been sleeping lately and some days I can’t even bring myself to eat because I’m  just so frayed and on edge. I wake up most mornings now to the sound of mum watching what I now call “Garbage people TV” on YouTube (Judge Judy, paternity court, the Maury Show, Jerry Springer, etc), so people just screaming loudly at each other for entertainment. Usually on two different TVs with the volume up so there’s nowhere I can’t hear it. I think because it’s families worst than us she feels better watching it. And this goes on all day.

Then today she drops the bombshell she’s started taking antidepressants. She tells me after telling me about how much of a cunt my brother was to her this morning, and as soon as I say something to agree with her, BOOM, she blurts it out. I ask her what else I can do to help her as I’m starting to cry and she just walks away leaving me standing there to try and deal with that.

All this family shit has been building up for a couple of years and I’ve learned if I try to say anything it quickly escalates into a fight and I’m just so tired of being made out to be the bad guy. I’m tired of being the one she calls for everything because her “not an addict” drug-fucked son either can’t or won’t help her. I’m just tired of it all.

Being from a small city there’s almost no mental health support here. There’s either a several month waiting list or I can go to a private doctor for hundreds of dollars a visit. I know this because a few years back when I had a breakdown I had to wait it out. 

But this time it’s different, I can’t escape it. Sure every so often we act like a normal happy family but that only ever lasts a couple of days at most. One of us will take a comment the wrong way and it’ll snowball right back to shit.

I don’t know what to do anymore. Even just typing this I’ve gone from stressed to angry to sad. I don’t see myself finding my way back to happiness by myself anymore.",01Jun2020,1
103,"Since the pandemic, my wife has been home all of the time, no routine, works for the government so is fully paid. I have to work, albeit less,  but keep a routine. I find her being around all the time just draining. I don’t want to hurt her feelings but I feel so sad having so much time with her around me. When things were normal we both had our work and routines and we met spent less time, but more quality time together. There’s little to talk about as we’re not doing anything so we have no experiences to share.

I feel desperate to have some space on my own, but have never felt the need to as life normally has us doing our own thing as well as sharing time together.

I also follow her OCD hygiene procedures and it’s slowly eating away at me as I find it exhausting and only do it for her.

104,"So first of all, I just want to say that english isn't my first language, so sorry if some things are hard to understand.
 So lately I've started to feel like there's someone else in my head, it's kinda difficult to explain but I'll do my best. 
 I feel like this because some of the choices I take, some of the thoughts I have and some of the things that I do feel like they are done by someone else, again as if there was something in my head making choices for me (and making the worst ones lol). Obviously I know that there isn't some entity in my head, maybe a better way of putting it would be to say that I'm losing control of myself to a certain extent. 
 This makes me feel awful obviously because I never know what bad decision that will mess up my life even more I'll make next, and because I can never really enjoy anything that I'm doing because I'm aware of this all the time.
 Also I've gone through some trauma when I was 14 (basically someone very close to me in my family died unexpectedly) and I never talked about this with anyone. I say that because I imagine that the feelings I have now probably relate to that trauma.
 Anyway, that is basically what I'm feeling, again, I'm sorry if any of this doesn't make sense, like I said english isn't my first language and this is the first time that I really talk about my feelings. So if you think you can help in some way please comment. I know that I probably need help from an actual psychologist, but I want to start by getting some advice from someone anonymous first, because talking about my feelings in person is very difficult for me lol.",01Jun2020,1

He lived in a different state and we didn’t date bc knew it wouldn’t work long distance (we were 16) but I fell for this guy. Then one day his phone was cut off and we lost touch.

118,"Hey everyone. 

Long story short I struggle with social anxiety related to C-PTSD.  I understand how this manifests in terms of “how do I make daily interactions with strangers” however it has been quite difficult for me to stay in touch with quite literally, anyone. 

Before you say “just reach out, get help, be honest” it would be helpful to explain my train of thought with this. I have NEVER been good with communicating. After being raised in a very poor example of what healthy communication looks like, it’s almost as if I cannot gauge what healthy communication looks like. Motivation is there to want to do something about this. The circle jerk of intrusive thoughts it leads me to, however, is absolutely exhausting. I don’t know where to start. 

Basically what I’d like to understand more:

• About how often do you talk to close friends and family? How much is too much/not enough? I worry often that I will be an annoyance to someone’s daily routine, especially with newer friends. Another burden for someone ELSE to respond to in their daily lives. I realize this makes the relationship distant. 

• What communication advice do you have on solidifying a relationship (of any type) through the good and the bad of mental struggles? The story goes: tell people I’ll try harder to communicate, genuinely mean it, fall back into this viscous cycle and continue to disappoint. I always try to explain without excuses but shit, of course you won’t understand the things that go through my head- it doesn’t function like it’s supposed to.

121,"Hi guys,

I'm a little stressed right now. Last night at two in the morning a friend of mine messaged me telling me that she wanted to kill herself. We've spoken about this in the past before. She always has suicidal thoughts and she handles them very well, but last night was different. She was very, very close. On the brink of doing it even. I'm truly honoured she felt she could trust me with the information, but that's beside the point. 

We spoke for about an hour. Everything in her life feels like it's falling apart and she feels like there's no escape from it. I told her that it sounded more like she wanted an escape from all the pain than to actually die, it's just that incidentally being dead serves that purpose quite finally. We normally talk conceptually, so I feel that what I said is far less tone-deaf than it sounds. I managed to calm her down and get her to go to bed safely. It took a while and I'm glad she couldn't see that I was panicking on the other side of the phone. I tried my very best to speak calmly, clearly, and carefully, choosing to speak concisely instead of overloading her with more words than she needed to hear. I made sure she knew (or at least heard) that she is loved and that there are other ways to deal with the pain and, if she's willing, I'll help her as best as I can. 

She wants to speak to me today. She'll ring me in about half an hour. I'm honestly panicking. Suicide is a topic close to home for me. I suffer from chronic depression and potentially borderline personality disorder or bipolar disorder (I'm currently in the process of screening for a more severe mental health condition and those are what I've been told are the two most likely options in my case). I don't know if what I've said to her is the right thing or if I'm going to be able to say the right thing today. 

Does anybody have any tips? I don't want to get this wrong.",01Jun2020,1

It’s been 2.5 months since lockdown began. I live in an apartment complex with my parents and there’s a fairly high concentration of positive cases in my locality, so I haven’t stepped out of my apartment in more than 2 months. 

I’d say I’m a pretty good student. I always stay at the top 10% of my class. But the final year is always extra stressful because of the enormity of portions I have to complete, no thanks to the current complete isolation. On top of that, my parents always keep telling me to study more, put more efforts (despite my telling them that saying things like that only proves to be counterproductive because I get so mentally affected by their comments that I can’t study the whole day). 

My dad has to work from home now, and he gets a lot of business calls. He speaks pretty loudly on call, and listening to him gives me constant anxiety and palpitations. One of the symptoms of mental illness is hypersensitivity to sound, so I wonder? 

I also have a boyfriend, who lives quite far away currently. I find myself consumed by thoughts of insecurity to the point of stalking his best girl friend. Today I found myself crying over a profile photo she had uploaded with him, along with a quote from his favourite new show. 

I’m also incredibly insecure about my body. I have gained a lot of weight in the past year, faced by offhand remarks about it from a lot of people (I know everybody has faced these kinds of things, I’m just saying that I’m not someone who can shrug it off and it affects me a lot), and this lockdown is obviously not helping with the weight gain. 

Some days are fine. Others, when everything comes tumbling down in my head, I get fleeting thoughts of killing myself. I have never attempted anything, these are just thoughts. But they can’t be normal right?

I'm really glad to have found a group that's so supportive. I've been battling mental illnesses for years now (I think 7, but possibly longer, I can't really remember that far back). Mostly depression mixed with anxiety. It's been very tough at times and there are a lot of times I didn't think I would make it, but something that I've found has helped me a lot especially in terms of finding my voice and saying what I need to say is writing songs, specifically raps but others as well. If you're creative in some form, I found it can be very helpful to have an outlet such as that. It doesn't have to be songwriting, but any kind of outlet is helpful. I actually wrote a song about my own personal battles called ""The Box in the Mirror"" that talks about some of my lowest points, being hospitalized multiple times, and how it affected my relationships. Honestly a lot of my music is going to be around these topics and more, I just haven't released any of it yet, but I did find it an incredible way to get out what I needed to say and even to get others to understand more of what I'm going through, a new means of communicating since talking about it flat out was so difficult.

Also, i dont want my death to be blamed on substance abuse... it wouldnt be fair as it is in sobriety that death calls me the most.

My hope is going but not completely gone... I guess i wish there was a way to fix my broken self that i dont know about!",01Jun2020,1
126,"I grew up with a very emotionally abusive mum. Physically abusive on occasion too. She neglected me and didn’t even provide me with essential toiletries. She was very controlling and used to call me names constantly. Things were at their worst in my teen years. 

My dad was lovely but worked very long hours and never saw the abuse to its full extent. 

I wasn’t spoken to about periods, sex or anything else. I was never bought a tampon or sanitary towel. My teen years were just horrendous. 

Anyway, when I was 14, I heard about something sexual at school. I was curious as to what this would feel like so tried it out at home. I should add that this didn’t involve any other child or adult and happened once. The thing I did was very very wrong but it seemed so insignificant at the time. I didn’t understand what I was doing and that it was wrong.

I completely forgot about what I had done until recently (18 years later). At first, I questioned whether it was a real memory or not as it was so vague but having thought more about it, I know it’s real. 

I physically hate myself and feel disgusting. I have a lovely husband and 2 beautiful kids. I don’t know how I can carry on with life knowing what I did. 

A close family member committed suicide so I know I couldn’t put my family through that but at the same time, I know I won’t feel at peace until I die and I feel like me dying will be a blessing for me, my husband and my kids.

129,"Hey guys! Today I woke up and finally admitted to myself that I can’t take it anymore. My mental health is on the edge. 
This is going to be a long story so please bear with me.


8 Years ago I had a pretty hard period in my life. I met a girl online, we’ve texted for a whole year and fell in love. She was more than 8000km away from me. At one point I said fuck it, bought plane tickets and met with her. And it was the best thing I ever did in my whole life. We were like meant for each other. I’ve never met a person that would understand me as she did, she was my life saver at one moment. 



So after our first meet up I had to go back to my country. As I was 20 at the time and she 19 we didn’t have much money to visit each other very often. I would buy plane tickets for her every 4-6 months and she would visit me for a month or two. This went on and on for over 3 years. 


She was studying linguistics and chose to study my language so she could later come to my country and become a teacher. 



She really wanted to be with me, she did everything she could to get a scholarship in my country and she did it! Although it costed almost 9000€ I worked my ass of to get that money for her. It was simple, she gets the scholarship (1 out of 300 ppl get it) and I try to bring that money up. 
Well, I fucked up and could only come around with 5000€, her parents offered us to sell their apartment to help with the rest of the money as they were not rich at all. I denied that offer. 


As everything went not as we planned, I told her that we could try it next year and I would have more time to get that money for us.



I started to work my ass if even harder, and oh boy, what a turn did my life take in this one year. 
Our relationship got a little bit stale, we didn’t fight a lot but I stopped caring as much about her as about my work. 



At work I met someone. She was clever, made me smile and would occasionally make me feel that what I am doing matters again. We shared the same hobby’s, loved the same art. There was an exhibition of Rubens in our town, my favorite artist, so was hers. She invited me to go as I was the only one she knew who shared her love to old paintings... well you can imagine where we ended up. It was a one time thing, but we catchend feelings for each other. I didn’t tell her that I have someone.




As time went on, me and my girlfriend started to fight over the smallest things, we loved to play games together but at the end if I saw her online, I would immediately go offline just not to talk to her. 


A few months before I got the whole sum to pay for her scholarship we somehow managed to brake up. She didn’t felt loved anymore, I didn’t felt that working off my ass for her somehow mattered. 


I started a relationship with this girl from my work and we are still together, I love her and she loves me, after 3 years of our relationship we never fought, we respect each other and we are planning to get married soon. 


Here’s the catch, I can’t let go of the thoughts what would happen if I worked on my previous relationship, what if that girl was the one and I fucked everything up. 


A year ago I started dreaming about her. Occasionally one or twice a week I dream about us being together again, in the dreams we are happy. So 6 months ago she contacted me and told me that after all these years she still thinks about me as the one. She met a few guys but it never was like that what we had. 
I took the chance and told her about the shit I did, that i met someone whilst we were still together and that I am still with that women. This broke her heart, I could hear it in her voice. I felt so sorry that I almost cried myself. 


The coming clean didn’t work out as planned and I still have dreams with that one girl. I just can’t let her go. I don’t know how. I feel more guilty now for breaking her heart. All these years in a healthy relationship with my new girlfriend I worked on my personality, I want to become a better human being and never to get in a situation like this again. 


Today I dreamed about my ex again, she was crying, I woke up and felt miserable. I don’t know what to do. The closest closest person to me is my fiancé and will definitely not tell her that my thoughts of my ex are tearing me apart. 
I hope that time will let me forget her and what happened.

132,"Hello I am struggling with OCD compulsive side and have had a counting habit for years. This has gotten worse lately and I have started working a full time job six says a week ten hours a day except Saturday in which I work five hours. The pay is 8.00 an hour and I am working at a marine cleaning boats. My counting habits arose more lately I feel from thinking about my past. I have done some terrible things and seen some messed up things in a sexual sense. I am rude and then feel bad about it later. Now this might sound crazy but this is how I can explain it. I have been in three bigger and what I see as somewhat real relationships with women (I used to catfish people and talk to people online and through video chats but I am considering people I have dated in real life) but two of these were not very long. I am with my girlfriend of two and a half years now and I have talked to other people during our relationship online but she has told me to get over it and to move on and to not talk about it and she says she has forgave me. I feel bad about it still and wish I could undo it but I as we all know can not go back and change it. Seems like I put meaning on to certain numbers. This is not a set in stone meaning and it changes often. Right now is I see one as the first person I was with of the three two as the second one and three as my current girlfriend. I count 1-6 then 1-3 then 1-2 and I do that three times sometimes nine times I say 1,2,3,4,5,6 1,2,3 1,2 and I say that three times totaling it to 33 because 6+3+2 is 11 I know it is confusing but it seems to help me stay sane and if I do not do it I worry. My girlfriend and I just graduated high school and we had a senior tea event and I saw one of my exes the first one in a dress and I recalled what it looked like and said it looked nice but as you could guess my girlfriend does not like me talking about my exes and it upset her that I remembered what my exes dress looked like. I repeat these numbers so much it is almost manic. I see a therapist and am on medicine but it does not really seem to be helping much. I want my girlfriend to be happy and she already has horrible issues such as BPD self hate and self esteem issues along with being very suicidal and depressed and dealing with sexual trauma in her past. This counting stuff is driving me crazy and I can not do things without panicking and worrying about things very often just overall. Please if anyone has advice share it.",01Jun2020,1

Due to this pandemic, has played havoc on my university work as it's all outside photography. So in March, I had to re-plan everything. Having dyslexia, I have added support for writing plus with me being out of education for a while - it takes me a while to adjust. *Anyway*, I applied for Extenuating Circumstances which instead of the deadline being 1st May, it became 25th June. 

The time is running out and I personally thought I was too far behind to complete. I had thoughts that I was completely useless at university and that I should quit whilst ahead. I emailed my support mentor just asking to drop out of university. I felt really low, overthinking everything. 

But, she then dropped me an email explaining that I'm doing fine and that I'd be slow at adjusting to university life after being out of education for a while. My thought process was normal and everyone she knew who had that thought process has been fine! 

I've not completed the work yet, but her long email gave me the motivation needed to continue. I'm now happy with my progress and very glad I didn't drop out, and gave it time and thought - unlike all the previous decisions I've made when I thought ""this is the only choice left"".

137,"I'm a 23-year-old gay man. I can't remember a single day without anxiety. 

I've had OCD my entire life (I only recently realized that). From weird blinking and walking rituals when I was a kid to unreasonable obsessive health concerns (cancer, HIV in my teen years). Recently, it started to manifest into obsessive sexual thoughts (like the fear of being straight or trans). 

Being a woman is my biggest fear, probably, and my brain is torturing me with incessant thoughts. Yes, I know that OCD-driven thoughts are the opposite of what we want because they are terrifying (I'm a masculine man), but I just keep revisiting my childhood memories when I occasionally fantasized about being a girl (because they were only girls in my class and I wanted to be the baddest bitch, lol) or being called a girl because of my meek character by my bullies and parents. The fact that I prefer being a bottom doesn't help.

He brought us to a place in the lake that was covered by trees so no one could see us, and he pulled me towards him and wrapped his legs around mine and held them closed. He was holding my wrists before he reached down and started touching/grabbing me through my swim trunks which were just soccer shorts. I don’t know how many times he touched me, I just remember him touching me and me thinking it was an accident, so I kind of stuck my butt out and crouched over so he couldn’t “accidentally” touch me again. But then he did touch me again and that’s when I saw him smiling at me. I was trying to escape and I was saying stop.

For years I have struggled with discipline, due to the majority of parental figures and authoritative figures in my life using negative, non-empowering and destructive punishment. I have since struggled with my mental health and it reached a tipping point sometime last week. I got into a verbal altercation with my partner and their parents.

To the point that I realized I was being emotionally abusive. I'm not okay with that.

So if I have your attention I'd like some advice.

I've never been able to hold a job down and all of my attempts at building new skills and sticking to the task at hand has always fallen through. I am on another endeavor to teach myself another skill, however I am fearful that I wont have the discipline necessary to fulfill the task. I need this vicious cycle of patterns to stop.

I cannot afford therapy but have been looking.

I need practical advice more than anything in this moment. I am seeking therapy, counseling, etc. But in the meantime I would appreciate an analytical approach to the issue of finishing what I start.

I know there is positive reinforcement but I know nothing about discipline without negative punishment, as to say non-constructive punishment, as i was never really taught. That point in my life left no room for the important lessons and conditioning that instills responsibility or discipline.

When I'm very passionate about something I can actually hyper focus on it to the point of neglecting responsibilities in my life.

So I wanted to know what the logic behind discipline is, how I can teach myself now that I'm an adult without reinforcing the negative trauma associated with my upbringing, and what part(s) of the brain control the emotions discipline (when done right) evokes?",01Jun2020,2

But then a couple of years ago it's like my brain shut down and was like ""we can't do this anymore"" and all my problems came back worse than ever before. 

I'm on a combination of six different medications and they seem to be working. My negative thoughts are far less frequent now, but there is still one major problem- i'm terrified of the general public. Going places, meeting new people, talking on the phone with strangers... All if it makes my heart race and my anxiety skyrocket. So on one hand I feel like I'm getting better in terms of motivation, no self harm, and no calls to the void (at least not as frequently). Generally I am happier- but on the other hand doing basic everyday adult things freak me out and I can't handle it.

154,"Hi all,  


I don’t normally post on Reddit, but I would like to get some outside opinions on a situation.  


A friend of mine’s brother in his mid-twenties has been going through a huge struggle with mental health for years now. He has struggled socially since his teens and has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder. He has been on and off many different medications although he is currently is not on any.  


He has seemed a little clumsy or forgetful when doing chores such as cooking in the past but lately, things have escalated. He has wandered outside late at night, leaving the door wide open, and appears confused when found. He has also been leaving the house and walking places with no shoes on. When asked about this, he simply responds, “Don’t worry about it.” He has even showered fully clothed. He does not seem to think or understand anything is strange about any of this behaviour. This is all entirely new for him and not something he has done before. He has also gotten increasingly more irritable, yelling, and destroying personal belongings in small fits of rage.    
 

He has been to many doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers and currently has one of each. He has also constantly been in and out of mental health facilities. The facility where I live is known for being especially awful and letting people out when they should be kept for further evaluation or care. They are saying that the behaviour is deliberate but even if this were the case, wouldn’t there still be some underlying issues to address? The family personally does not feel that it is deliberate and has stated that he seems disoriented and as if he is not even the same person.   
 

Has anyone heard of or experienced any symptoms like this? Or have any suggestions of what could be going on? I’m not looking for a diagnosis, as mentioned, he has the medical professionals for that. However, I am curious if anyone else has experienced or heard of anything like this and if so, what was it in that case?   
   
I’m basically looking for any words or resources I can use to help the family or help them bring up a conversation with a professional or something. It has been very stressful for everyone involved. I hope he can get the help he needs and want to do what I can to help.

Now I don't feel like studying anymore. I don't feel like playing the piano anymore. It's so weird. I'm not sad or anything, but my depression lead to so many failures that it kind of turned into a self fulfilling prophecy, if that makes any sense at all.

158,"usually reddit is really comforting i can relate to people, i can try to advice people with things therefore making me feel connected to someone, i can see nice things, etc but today is bad and weird and everything here that i encounter that is negative affects me a lot more than usual. things like someone calling someone a ‘whore’ makes me cry because i realise so suddenly how judgmental the world is and i feel so scared and sad to be in it. obviously what’s going on in the states too is really horrible and i don’t know what to do basically regarding reddit and how much time i spend on it. i think i just need someone to say it is indeed okay because it doesn’t feel like it there is so much bad and usually i can say hey it’s okay there’s good too but nothing feels good enough to go against the awful bad. thank you for reading it was very nice of you &lt;3 have a 🍰",01Jun2020,1
159,"So, I've been VERY stressed about quarantine. I think that's part of it. I never have felt like I'm over weight, I've actually slimmed down a lot from a few years ago... but since quarentine, I've lost lots of weight.
I'm a 13 year old boy, and I'm 98 pounds. I'm very afraid. If I stretch my arms up I can see my ribs a little. It's not that I'm not eating, like an eating disorder... I'm just not getting hungry, like at all. I dont eat during the day cause I'm not hungry. And at night. I'll eat a little but that's it. I've been drinking lots of water. I'm just afraid, and I dont know how to eat more.",01Jun2020,3

161,"Before I go on my rant, I will preface by saying I do have a therapist I work with on a weekly basis and am seeking the help I need during this time.

It has taken me a long time, but this quarantine has made me look at my problems straight in the face and accept that I have an eating disorder. For years, I would say that I suffer from “disordered eating behaviors” because I would go through periods of starvation, but never be underweight. But now, I can’t really avoid the fact that I struggle with food, I don’t eat and some days it really feels like looking at the end of a barrel when it comes to having to eat at all. 

Before quarantine, I considered myself having been recovered for 3 years. I would eat like a normal person. I would eat enough most days, and eat over my recommended intake on days I wanted to treat myself. During those 3 years, I would rarely not eat, and if I realized I wasn’t eating, I would immediately remedy it and properly address my stress. Now, with the 70+ days of quarantine, I’ve easily starved for 75% of the time, barely eating but eating enough so I don’t pass out. I’ve lost a little under 10% of my starting weight which for my size, can be considered a significant loss even though I’m not near being underweight. 

I realized my biggest crutch was going to the gym. My therapist and I have been discussing that I would go to the gym 4-6 times a week, and burn (what I thought was a low, normal amount) a ton of calories. I would usually eat enough to maintain my weight, but I was still burning more than someone my age and size should be doing on a daily basis. 

Now, I’m scared. I’m scared because after hiding this from my family since I was in high school, they’re starting to notice I’m not eating. They comment everyday how I’m losing weight. My boyfriend is worried about me. I’ve always had to deal with this struggle alone enough though I’ve confided in people over the years about it. A lot of the times, what it comes down to, is that they just tell me to eat. I understand they’re only trying to help, but I makes me feel like a failure when I can’t stomach the idea of eating.

I know that the logical, simple answers are all in front of me. They are the facts and mantras I had about food that powered me through recovery. I know it would be really hard for me to gain a significant amount of weight (unless I binged often, which I don’t). I know the simple answer is to just eat. But I can’t. I haven’t felt like I can’t in so long. It’s so hard to explaining my mindset to my boyfriend, and I know he’s frustrated with me. He’s trying so goddamn hard to help me and I feel like every time I choose not to eat, I’m failing not only him but my loved ones and myself. But when I do chose to eat, it’s awful. I get physically uncomfortable. I feel anxious, a level anxiety I haven’t felt since I was in college when I had to eat. 

I’ve been talking to my therapist about all of this. He says he isn’t comfortable giving me an official diagnosis (other than anxiety) until I’ve spoken with their psychiatrist because there are multiple layers to what I’ve been dealing with. But even he admitted that he believes that I do have some eating disorder, or even OCD since I obsess and have intrusive thoughts specifically around food and exercise.

It’s a lot. I’m unsure what to do most days. I feel myself closing off to everyone I love most, even my boyfriend. I don’t know how to talk about this stuff anymore, even with the person I feel most vulnerable with. I’ve tried talking to him, but I feel like most times I do, he becomes frustrated (understandably so) or he just says he can’t talk to me anymore about it. 

I guess I just wanted to get it out in the open, because at least then I’m not feeling trapped in my own head about it. And again, I’m seeking the help I need during this time and I hope all of you are seeking the help you need too.",01Jun2020,1
163,"Hello to the community,

I feel a bit lost lately and I do not know how to overcome the way I feel. I am 29 and I currently do my master thesis in my favorite subject. Due to the situation is hard to meet with supervisors physically and we meet online which does not help at all.  The to dos are keep getting more and more while I fight alone with no help. I discussed it with the but they all blame coronavirus lately. This puts more pressure on me because I am worried about my future career and opportunities..I was thinking to tell them that I need to take some time off since the situation does not help at all! 

In addition to that, 3 months ago I broke up with my girlfriend while I was in an exam period. Was the worst think EVER. She left with no reason and said goodbye via message. To be honest, this killed me deep inside. After we broke up I could not sleep at night for almost 2 months and I was dreaming about her. She follows me on insta and social media and she continues to like my photos and whatever I post..

In the meantime, I live far away from my home country and I cannot go back home at the moment. There are no flights going there and I am trapped in my studio since there is lockdown over here.

I just wanted to share my thoughts. Thank you for reading my post. Stay safe and be kind to each other Xx",01Jun2020,1
164,"My dream is to be certified as a tax accountant in Japan and have my own business to help foreigners who would like to open businesses in Japan.

There must be many people who want to move to Japan but are unable to do so due to the language barrier and local regulation.

But that dream has put on hold because of the worst and terrifying experience while I was living in a country in South East Asia.

I got scammed by loan sharks - illegal moneylenders. 


I moved to this country one year and half years ago for my career. I was also studying to be a certified accountant.


And I needed a loan for tuitions. The bank couldn’t lend me because I was still new to the country.


And I found the website for a loan institution. I have provided my phone number and they have called me. I applied for a loan, and instantly approved. I was skeptical. After hearing the loan term. It was shocked that the interest rate is more than 30% in a weekly rate (not annual rate).


I refused and requested for the cancellation. They yelled at me. I was terrified. Then, they demanded a cancellation fee of doubled loan amount. I kept refusing to pay. But they harassed me by telling me to reveal all my personal information and the fact that I borrowed money illegally to my company and on the internet.

I did not know what to do but took a weekly loan. This was their strategy.

A week later, I paid off by paying the sky-rock interest. Then they started sending me money without my loan agreement. From that point, I was trapped. For the last 10 months or so, I suffered from their harassment and debt has increased to around approx. USD20,000, which started with that first loan USD2000.

I have been mentally depressed since then and became suicidal since April 2020. I could not confess this to my family, friend, and company because I was very ashamed of myself.

And I no longer be able to pay the illegal lenders. The harassment has escalated. I attempted the suicide for a couple times. But of course I couldn’t. I am a weak person.

On May 10th, 2020, My choice was to kill myself or ask for help.


At this moment, I hadn’t have a good sleep for a month, and I couldn’t eat at all. Due to Covid-19, I was stuck in my room. And I was just staring outside all day.

But somehow, I was writing to my friends and family in Japan for help. They bought an airplane ticket for me right away, and I escaped from the country next day.

I am back in Japan but still very much depressed. Sometimes I still think about disappearing.

however, I try to think positive. I still want to achieve my dream. 


Due to the illegal lenders, my personal debt has increased because I was paying them using my credit cards and savings etc. 

now I am back home in Japan. I want the second chance to restart my life from scratch, and work hard toward my dream.


I would like to ask you for favor of monetary support for doctors’ visits and recover also from the debt


Thank you so much,

T",01Jun2020,1

I wake up and lay in bed for hours until I have to get ready for work. I work all day and I can be fine. I can laugh and talk and be upbeat and happy.

Then I get in the car and drive home, in silence. I sit in bed and don’t turn on the tv, just mindlessly scroll on fb or reddit until I sleep for the night, and do it all again the next day.

I don’t want to clean my house. I don’t want to play with my dogs. I don’t go out with my friends, or play games, watch tv, paint, hike, anything like I KNOW I should.

I have no motivation, no drive to actually get up and live.

I’m scared of taking medicine, but I’m so tired of sitting in silence being so damn numb. My life is flying by and I’m missing all of it because I can’t get out of bed.

166,"I have a roommate, in this post I'll call him ""Mike"". Mike is usually very normal, but recently he's been worrying us. Two nights ago my roommates, a friend of mine who was crashing here, and I were watching (but mostly ignoring) back to the future II and chatting. We were talking about the anti-police protests going on around the US, and Mike had a lot to say (Mike is Hispanic). I tried to listen to what he was saying, but he was not making much sense. He kept talking about how we were all slaves, and that people were starting to wake up. Specifically, he kept telling us that ""his eyes were open"". This was my first hint that something was wrong. Later in the night I saw Mike's eyes welling up before he rushed himself to the bathroom, I tried to ask him if everything was okay but didn't get a response. Another thing that stands out to me about this night was the date he kept repeating- July 4th. Mike seemed convinced that a revolution would start on July 4th. I tried to ask him about this, why he thought something was happening on July 4th, but did not get a satisfactory response; Mike seemed worried that our various electronic devices were listening to our conversations.

The next day brought something more troubling. Mike walked up to me and confronted me- he said he knew I was planning something for June 1st. My other roommate, concerned at hearing this, sat us all down for a discussion. After talking some more, we found out that Mike thinks me and the friend I invited are involved in a conspiracy or terrorist plot of some kind. My roommate and I tried, in the gentlest way possible, to dissuade him of these ideas but to no avail. Ever since then Mike will sometimes walk up to me and ask me what my plans are. (every time I answer the truth- absolutely nothing)

178,"Hello.

Some background.

We are both in college but go to different universities in different states.  I know her from highschool and the last time I've seen her in person was graduation.  In our senior year, for whatever reason, I decided to open up to her more about my own mental health issues.  This caused me to be extremely fond of her.  We reconnected around a year ago after I got a message from her.  I will admit that I did have a crush on her in highschool which made things strange and ever since reconnecting I have gotten those feelings back, but now I'm unsure about it.  I wasn't sure if mentioning this was important, but I figured the more context the better.  I have depression and anxiety, especially when it comes to people and making friends.  Her mental health issues, which I don't want to go in detail about out of respect for her, are much worse than mine.  On to the main issue:

I have decided that regardless of how I feel about her, I still want to be there for her as a friend.  I don't want to bail on her because of something she can't control.  However, she is not making it easy.  She does this strange thing where she will ""isolate"" herself and essentially ghost me and has done this multiple times for various lengths of time.  She says that she does this to everyone, and I have no reason not to believe her.  She also knows that she shouldn't be doing that and knows that it's just her mental health issues getting the better of her.  The last time she did this, I didn't hear from her for almost three months.  I would call and text because I wanted to know if she is ok, but all I would get was radio silence.  This would be hard on me because I would start to think that she just doesn't want anything to do with me anymore or that I messed up or that something horrible happened to her and there would be no way of knowing, etc.   Eventually I  stopped for a while because I thought she might need space and that I realized the constant calling was starting to become pathetic.  After three weeks of leaving her alone, I just decided to try one last time, against my better judgement, and she actually responded.  Anyways I was surprised and  she said she was doing the isolating thing again and that she was sorry and she was going to try better.  I told her it was ok and that I'm here for her and that I understand etc. etc.  Not but two weeks later, and she's doing it again.  I've called and texted several times but I've heard nothing.  It's only been a few days, but I have no idea how long this will last, whether it will be only a few days or months again.  I really want to be there for her because I care about her, but how can I when I can't even talk to her?  Not to mention that I'm the only one who calls and texts.  I'm really the only one who tries to reach out to her, while she never bothers calling me to see how I'm doing.  Sometimes it feels like she just doesn't want me around and she's too afraid to say anything.  So she just ghosts me and hopes I give up.  I know that she has a really hard time and her problems are a lot bigger than mine, but it always seems like I'm the only one putting any effort into this friendship.  Honestly, I wish she would just be honest with me if she really doesn't want me around anymore.  Well I know that it's probably hard to give any sort of advice for something like this, but honestly I'd just like to hear any thoughts you might have on the matter.",01Jun2020,4

183,"hi everyone.
I don’t know if this is the right community to post this on but I will give it a try.

so, since I was a young teenager (f), I have not been skinny but also not fat. I did have curves throughout my teenage years, big thighs and also more breast. I was eating lots of sweets and also fat things and as I went clubbing, I also drank alcohol every other weekend. During my chubbier years I would complain to my mom sometimes that I thought I was getting too fat but eventually, I wouldn’t think about it much as I still liked my curves. I was always particularly proud of my thighs and my butt.

this has completely changed when I moved countries and moved out of my mom’s place 2 years ago. I noticed how with work and education, I didn’t have time to eat as much snacks as I used to and I lost some weight. I have met my boyfriend short after
moving and I notice I eat healthier and due to adult stress and more moving around due to duties, I did some sort of exercise I wasn’t doing before. plus I got diagnosed with anxiety. 

now, I am sure I have lost 10 kg in 2 years. I do still have curves but I am very unhappy with my body. especially nowadays with curves being in focus on beauty, it makes me feel self conscious. everybody tells me I have a good body as it looks more healthy but I am devastated for some reason... I am currently counting my calories and try to make it to 2,000 a day, which is very hard as I just don’t feel as hungry as I did some years ago. I am particularly devastated when I notice my clothes are getting very lose and whenever I look into the mirror, I could cry. At some days, I feel like I gained weight and I am happy. Then the next day, I feel again too skinny. 

I am going to a therapist but due to the pandemic, our sessions aren’t as regular right now and it’s hard to reach out to him whenever...

184,"I’m 21M. I live with my mother but I was really raised by my grandparents. 

I feel as though I have tricked everyone I know into thinking I’m a high functioning individual. I average Cs at school because I don’t try. I know my potential well and I know I’m capable of getting good grades. But for some reason, I can’t force my learning. High test scores don’t mean anything if I have 0s in everything else, at least to me. I have never done well in school. My standardized testing scores called me gifted, while I was failing off my track and field team in 3 different classes. Fast forward to college, and this semester I nearly failed two classes. My dream is to be the first in my family to pursue higher education, and to break the cycle of the shitty people my family produces. That dream is starting to feel unattainable because of my tanking GPA and mental state.

I can’t talk to my mom about these things. I can’t talk to anyone about these things. And I don’t know why, I have asked myself time and time again. I even secretly have a therapist, but I don’t think I’m going to see her again. It helps but I feel like she tells me things I already know, because I can’t just tell her how I feel. I have many issues stemming from my childhood and emotional abuse (not from immediate family, though). 

I feel my mother is a little spoiled and she is heavily lacking in the empathy department. She had me very young, and this forced her to be dependent on my grandparents. I think this dependency was necessary but the side effects are present. In my life, she effectively plays the role of a very caring sister. I know she loves me but it doesn’t feel like a mother’s love. I think I just got used to being alone, and this causes my thoughts to drift away from reality. I am not sure of who I am.

However, he injured his opponent badly during training and caused his opponent to have an asthma attack, resulting in him not being able to go back to training for 6 months. And now that the corona virus is going on and all outside activities had been stopped, he was not able to express his intense emotions through Taekwondo which was his only outlet.

He and my mother would verbally assault me and mistreat me badly, often making me feel like a worthless sack of shit. I was sexually assaulted by family members and strangers at a young age. I was bullied a large part of my childhood, at one of the many schools I went to it got so bad that it made the local newspapers. I was the only latino kid I knew probably anywhere where I live, so I grew up feeling very alone and misunderstood. My parents tried to get rid of me at two or more occassions during my childhood, I always blamed myself for this.

I never performed well in school so I always used to see myself as unintelligent - I later found out that I have ADHD after seeking treatment for my concentration issues, something that my parents and other family members neglect to this day. My parents still mistreat me, I'm still bullied by them, yet still I work for the family business and do everything I can to help maintain the company and continue the legacy. 

Three weeks ago I told my mother I wanted to follow my dreams and become a gardener, she responded by scoffing at it and saying that it sounded ridiculous. I replied playfully that she wouldn't be invited to my graduation the day that I finish my studies. This led to a huge argument where my mother bullied me and disrespected me in every way possible, pushing all of my buttons and humiliating me. I later called my father in desperation and told him that I didn't want to continue working for the family business and that I was only doing it for them, he responded that I was mistaken and that the only reason I was working for them was because I couldn't stand on my own feet and needed them. He told me that my mother doesn't need my help and that at the end of the day, only the two of them mattered. In the midst of his rant I blurted out that I had been sexually molested as a child, he completely disregarded it and told me that he was taking care of his grandchildren and couldn't discuss that at that time. This blew a hole in my heart, I had never felt so lonely in my life. All the pain and neglect I had felt all of my adolescent life was neglected yet again. 

That same night I called my sister and father in law, I told them everything. From the beginning. My sister came by the next day and we talked it out, she told me that she completly understood me, loved me and that she would be by my side whatever I do.

Fast forward to yesterday, mothers day. I went to my parents house and had dinner, all of us pretending that nothing of this was going on. I saw my sister being very loving and caring with my father, everyone being super happy and just pretending that life was good. That was it. The culmination of all the things I've felt my entire life. I felt alone, abandoned, misunderstood and neglected. Yesterday I lost hope for everything, I lost the will to live. My girlfriend tries her best but it's not enough. My entire life is a lie, I'm so ridiculously unhappy. I'm ready to finish it and get rid of this pain. I want all of them to feel my pain and make them feel disgusted with themselves, I want them to be held accountable for their actions. I want them to feel my hurt, my neglect, my endless sorrow. I want to hurt them so bad that they never recuperate. I want to leave nothing behind but a letter where I write the most hurtful things I can imagine and never give them the opportunity to adress it. I want them to feel the hatred that has corrupted my heart. I want them to understand how tired I am.

I'm going to go for a drive and I might never come back. I want to crash into a tree at high speed and end my life. I'm ready.",01Jun2020,1
191,"I've been in and out of therapy/counseling for a very long time, and I've recently felt that it's time to seek outside, professional help again. I've reached out to several therapists/companies and I've finally found one locally with some openings.  


To date, therapy and work have never overlapped, but now it will. What (if any) information do I need to disclose to my manager? My goal is to schedule weekly appointments that are as low impact as possible to my work, but it will require me to miss some amount of work, and I'm assuming my manager should get some amount of heads up concerning reoccurring ""doctors appointments"".

192,"Maybe it’s just me but when I’m with my boyfriend my “baby” voice comes out. His brother has expressed annoyance with it even though most of the time it comes out it’s behind closed doors in my boyfriend’s room (they share an apartment). So I feel like he should mind his own business. It’s not like I’m switching my identities or anything it’s literally just the pitch of my voice that changes. Sometimes I can’t help it. Like I’ll be on the phone with my boyfriend while at a drive thru and suddenly I’ll accidentally speak to the barista in a baby voice. 

I’m pretty controlled about it but it is something that I’ve done since I was a little kid. I’ve always had a baby voice that I would be reprimanded for when I was a kid and teen. I did it a lot for attention. Part of me hated the thought of growing up so I always regressed. Sometimes I still do. I feel like I always develop emotionally a lot later than my peers have and it’s slowly catching up. Idk if any of this makes sense.

Hiya! My name's CJ. I'm 21 years old. I'm an aspiring writer and have a huge interest in mental health. I've been working on an informational book (yet to be named) that more or less encapsulates dozens of known and some unknown mental health/behavioral or otherwise relevant disorders and disabilities that affect how the mind perceives certain situations. 

I need people who are willing to have interviews about disorders/conditions that they may be experiencing. It's a simple 10-question text interview. The purpose of the interview is to provide a first-person perspective on whatever topic the consumer/reader may be looking at. Elect anyone you want for it, just shoot me a message if you're interested!   
Topics available for interview are here: [https://pastebin.com/MGMMkeDh](https://pastebin.com/MGMMkeDh)
Edit : Depression and DID interviews are not available, I've gotten multipme for each already. Anything else is on the table!

I hope to hear from some of you! Stay strong and remember to take care of yourself. You're not alone and deserve to have people around you who care. 🖤",01Jun2020,2
200,"I remember the time. When I used to be excited to wake up and get ready for the day. The day had spontaneity. Who am I going to meet today? What will I learn today? What new wisdom will I acquire from the most unexpected places? I remember going to sleep with a rush of excitement in my heart. I remember waking up with strength and willpower. Pushing my self to get up and learn. All I had to do was show up. And when I showed up, someone will be there to guide and support me. 

The last time I felt this feeling was 3 years ago. Now I go to sleep and my heart feels empty. Confused. Knowing that tomorrow will be similar to the last day. Knowing that the only spontaneity is what I will choose to happen to myself. I wake up empty. What is the point, when no one is there. No one cares. No one will hold my hand, nor guide me. My spontaneous wisdom comes from strangers on YouTube because people don't randomly talk to me on the streets anymore. Like they used to. What happened to mentorship. It feels like money is the driver. If I don't give money for time of another person. No direct face to face mentorship. 

If I don't make money, I get comments from my family. Get a real job. Just Get A Job. Any Job. I get a job and feel sick being indoors. Physically sick without movement. I have the urge to run, at least half of my day. I wake up feeling trapped. It's like being stuck in an asylum of the same day for years. I know I am very capable as a human being. I have to convince employers that I am. I apply to jobs feeling overqualified for the pay. I don't hear back. Surprised because I know I am good enough. Why do I have to convince someone else that I am good enough. That is what drives me insane the most. 

I continue working to improve my skills, because I know no matter how good, there is always room for better. I wake up empty. I want to get out of this trap. I begin my day with a run. Then a coffee. I sometimes convince myself to ignore the fact that I have to spend time making others believe in me, when I already believe in myself. I begin working. Doing the same things as the founders, same tasks as the employers themselves. Because I know I am capable. I finish a hard day of work. Only to be told by people around me that ""I am just unemployed and I do nothing"". ""Maybe if you didn't do nothing, you won't be so depressed"". To which my heart sinks.

 What is the difference if I write and create content for my own movement on the environment, then get paid grant money to do someone else's movement. Why is my movement suddenly less worthy, just because I am unemployed. As I sit there, learning how to write, use adobe programs and create movements from scratch, investing my own money for a greater good, I get told that I am doing nothing and to get a REAL job. Where I do the same thing for grant money. I however will be stripped of my freedom to spend 1/2 my day in movement. I made a decision that, I do not want to spend so much time, proving my value to people who are equal as me. Just as capable. Just another business person like me, being confused and problem solving as they go. We should be proving our value to each other.

 Sometimes I try to do something on my own. And I get told that I am stupid, incapable and I get yelled at. My dad tells me ""If you have never done anything, why are you pretending you know?"" words like ""you idiot, why haven't you done anything, you don't listen, you don't do anything. Don't try, you will break it. Not with those hands. you don't know anything. Let me do it. I spent hours helping you (when I warned him that he doesnt have to). When I make a minor mistake in life, and it's not my fault. I come home calmly being good on myself. I come home to hectic freak out about my life. calling me stupid. you did this again. it must have been you that fucked up. because you are stupid. it's your fault you are in my way. stop coming under my arms, you made me fuck up."" 

Being in this house, I feel un-empowered. when my life fucks up, it's me that fucked up. When I try to do a task, it's like something is wrong with my hands. I feel hunched and incapable. I feel like that in life sometimes too. 

I am told everyday about a ""They"". ""They"" are just trying to overthrow the government. ""They"" have brainwashed you of feminism and gay is ok. (It IS all ok) ""They"" are trying to start a revolution. ""You are stupid, wake up!! and stop living in ""their"" brainwashing"". 

I am shaking, I am scared to do things for other people. I feel watched. Micromanaged. My capable hands crumble, in front of someone. Proving me incapable to them. I can hear the voices over and over in my head. ""You don't do anything. You fucked up again. Go get a REAL job. No one cares about your art or initiatives. Not with those hands.

 The world is a negative place where ""they"" are in control."" It is covid19. All the jobs are online. I don't want to be forced to spend my time in this house. I want to be gone. I run and run and run away as far as I can. I feel relief the further I go. I feel peace. I feel like I can just be myself and fail peacefully. To get out of my house, I need to get a job during covid. To get a job I have to prove my worth to someone else. to get paid trash money. because non profits. its ridiculous. 

I used to work for someone else in the banquet industry. I felt so stupid. I felt like I was seen as stupid. treated like I am stupid. I am not though. My ego hurt me in that way. I felt like I was getting paid but not learning. I was independent however and free of the vocal abuse. 

I lay here in bed. Hoping that I will get that exciting feeling in my heart again. I wouldn't feel so alone. Be so alone and I can get out of my current state. I am taught, not to play the victim card, I am told not to make excuses. I ignore it all and keep working. How long can I hold up? Will I hold up enough to escape? Will I learn that working with people is a safe thing to do and I won't be told that I am too slow or incapable? Will my hands not crumble? 

I do a lot in my life. I can probably even be a freelancer. I tend to slow down when; I get into an argument with my family and feel useless after. I get depressed because I start believing that I will not make money and be stuck in the house longer. I try to solve that depression by listening to positive podcasts that encourage my viewpoint and go for walks, watch videos to self care. I feel incredibly alone and start searching for connection on social media. I feel cabin fever and I go outside, I need spontaneity, sometimes I go on youtube for that. I feel happy outdoors, going on road trips always helps. I actually feel so happy that I forget about depression. Until I come back home and it hits me hard, repeating the cycle once again.",01Jun2020,1

204,"Hello! I’m a 22 year old in the general Boston area, and I went to my first protest last night. I’m very glad I went, but I saw a lot of very awful, traumatic things I wish I had never seen. It definitely opened my eyes more, but it made me so fueled with emotion. Anger, rage, sadness, sympathy, etc. peaceful protestors were wrongfully injured. I won’t go on about the details as it’s obvious.

I woke up today feeling somewhat okay. I was saddened, but I had felt such a sense of solidarity at the protest that it made it worthwhile. I felt like I was making a real change.

I log onto Facebook, and let me tell you, it’s been an ugly day. I was met with a timeline filled with 50/50 posts. Half of my timeline was BLM and half was all lives matter. I DO NOT want to make this post political. I do not want any comments regarding politics and I don’t want to imply anything. My question is simply this:

I’m someone who struggles with general anxiety and bipolar type 2. I’m still figuring out meds as my diagnosis is relatively new so my emotions aren’t completely regulated yet. What are some ways that I can help relieve this awful feeling? The news, the radio, Facebook, streets, it’s all hatred. It’s so ugly and brutal and I know it’s necessary for change but it’s HARD, for real! I am strong in the sense that I’m here to stay and support, but I often times feel like I could cry at the drop of a hat and I feel this anxious shakiness in my chest all day. I’m trying to not be addicted to the news and my social media, but with everyone trying to argue with everyone else it ends up creeping up on me with anything I share. No matter which side you are on, the fact is it’s sad we have to pick sides. How do I cope with feeling so lost and overwhelmed by this sadness? What are some good distractions and conversarion  topics, so that all of my convos with friends and family don’t have to be about this every second of the day? I am very vocal and do have discussions when it’s needed but how can I take my brain away from this anxious state of affairs were in? 

I need ideas!

208,"Hello, I am 23, live in Minnesota, and have severe, treatment resistant depression. I also have ADD that has stopped responding to medication for several years now, and anxiety that occasionally responds to medication. I am curious about treatments for depression that are not talk therapy or medications. 

To start, I have heard about Ketamine and various electric therapies. I think medical marijuana is a treatment for treatment resistant depression too, but I am not so sure about that. If anyone has heard of any alternative treatments for depression, please tell me. If you have done something like ketamine or electric therapies, how did you get started? My doctors continuously have not been able to help me find this information, so I am hoping for a tip that can help direct me in the right path. Even what kind of doctor to talk to is helpful. 

Also, I have had at least 28 medications fail me, and as a matter of fact the person who was prescribing my medications flat out said today that they can’t help me anymore because they don’t know what to do because there are no more medications that they feel comfortable prescribing me, so that is why I am researching these alternative treatments. And that is why I really don’t want to hear about any medications. Plus, I am not interested in any talk therapies at the moment. I did several different kinds of therapy for years with several different people, and I never felt that therapy helped me despite my best efforts. As a matter of fact, I have actually been booted from therapies in the past for being too depressed. I didn’t even know they could do that the first time it happened, so I was really surprised. Most therapies that the average person my age could do are ones I can not do so easily not because I am unwilling, but because of the fact that I appear so depressed that providers feel that I need a higher level of care than what they can provide, and then they refer me to other places as they are legally obligated to do. However, the problem with that is that I have already done all the most intensive therapy options in my area that are available to me. So right now, the situation is that I am being pushed back and forth through a system that has failed me, and it is really hard for me to figure out what to do next because nobody else seems to know. I worked so hard to make therapy work, it is such a shame. I am laughing as I type this because it is so unbelievable that this is happening. Who would think this would happen. I just can’t help but laugh. So please don’t tell me to see a therapist. I already tried my hardest and it made me worse than when I started. I really need a break. Maybe therapy will help me after I get electroconvulsive therapy or something.

I greatly appreciate any response I may receive!",01Jun2020,1

210,"I’m sure there are others who’ve experienced this...I used to be pretty reckless with sex. I used it as a tool to gain attention, and a way to connect with someone when I didn’t know how to/was afraid to by feeling and talking about my emotions. I felt power from it but was almost like a slave to my sexual desires rather than my mental and emotional needs. It just “seemed” safer that way. 

Enter my boyfriend. Our relationship has never been solely about sex. I would say we had a really healthy balance of it all, before my mental health got in the way. I went off an SSRI and stopped going to therapy. I experienced tons of anxiety and depression, and needless to say, that killed my sex drive. On top of that I felt like I was being insanely triggered by childhood trauma I never processed (I still don’t understand it but that’s the only way I can explain it) during my everyday life. I became pretty nonfunctional for a bit. Sometimes I would muster up the energy for sex, but it would almost be painful for even his hand to touch my leg/shoulder/any non-sexual area. This improved as I started to feel more stable again, but I’m now back in that territory. 

I feel a lot of guilt for this, because it has nothing to do with what I feel for my boyfriend. On the contrary, I’ve never felt MORE at ease and in love. He totally fulfills me emotionally, and for some sick reason that makes me uninterested in sex. It sucks. 

I just restarted therapy and we’ve already talked about attachment issues and social anxiety and all that good stuff. It’s all starting to make sense to me, but if you can relate to this in anyway, I’d love to hear from you. :)",01Jun2020,2
211,"There's a trend in NZ for mental health awareness where you do 25 push ups for 25 days, you have to challanege others to do it too. I don't agree with it:

Can't we do 25 days of showing weakness instead of re-enforcing the stereotypical ""A man is strong""? I'd rather be involved in a trend of people allowing themselves to be seen when they're VULNERABLE, so those in mental hardship can see that it's OK, and feel more comfortable showing it themselves- Not get discouraged or feel pressured yet again to live up to the toxic pressures of ""what a man is"". There's so many other ways to show strength than the physical. And yes I'm aware of the 2 dimensional 'for a good cause' raising awareness trope for the 25days challenge- but really think about what we're doing before we become part of it.

Part of a  conversation with a close friend;
""When were watching people do push ups were subconsciously looking for weaknesses"" whether in their technique, how far from the ground they push &amp; thinking a little less of those who did it on their knees- this is not supporting those with mental illness its serving the old ways. Why can't there be men/people crying instead of doing push-ups? And why the #challenge? If someone gets tagged in a challenge and they don't do it,- does that mean they are weak or simply don't care? No it doesn't. And when a woman does it but a man doesn't, are they less of a man now? No they're not. 

A man has hardships
A man has sensitivities
A man cries 

And that's more than OK, its NORMAL. Instead of hiding all our flaws and vulnerabilities (which I have been doing myself if I'm being honest), let's celebrate ""weaknesses"" in hopes that someone in Mental hardship will feel more comfertable expressing it to someone else.",01Jun2020,1

Feels like I was only happy when I was small and ever since I've grown up, everything has f*cked for me. I have zillion responsibilities on my shoulders, million things to think about, my mind is in a constant maze game and I'm struggling hard to get out but I never do. 

Whenever I laugh and smile I am more concerned about going back to my old life after the laugh ends instead of enjoying the moment. I cry a lot, it hurts my chest and my shoulders. 

I have no one to talk about this with, my mother is nice and she's depressed herself, struggles with life and I do not want to put this on her, even if I do talk a lot of things she won't understand. My dad is an ass and doesn't live with us here. 

Everything is just messed up, I feel like a burden on everyone's head. I feel like I should be somewhere else, some other spot, some other place. I do not belong here.",01Jun2020,1
213,"So, as a kid I've never been abused physically or mentally, atleast in a traditional sense, growing up my parents used to fight a lot and unlike normal parents they'd tell me and my siblings everything, often exaggerated and filled with ahte for the other. My siblings weren't affected as much since they're both 3 and 4 years older than me.
Over time I became an antisocial and resended, growing up I had to experience a lot of things by myself from my perents fighting to strong hallucinations probably caused by schizophrenia ( I'm still kind of confused because I'm pretty sure I am depressed as well, which isn't possible is it? refferring here to the fact that schizophrenia and depression are hormonally opposite)
Anyways, I went through a few psychoses one of them lasted for 1½ years, the whole psycoses was about this extremely real dream I had, it was a part lucid dream nearly like  W.I.L.D, the time in that dream was equal to the time in real life, in that life I grew up, a little rebellious and a little mentally frustrated, fell in love with a woman because she somewhere in once conversation said to me ' I accept you as you are, no I actually love you for who you are' I know it's kinda cliché but it moved me back then, I was only 12 after all. So, we live on have a happy life, no kids, happy life when she's about 65, she dies of a natural cause, I try to live on by walking right into the sea and as I suffocate to breathe, I wake up.
I know this was simply a dream and nothing supernatural and I assume I knew that back then too but everything I felt was more real than it still is in this world, over and over night after night I have cried because I have forgotten her name and a lot of things from the dream but the sensations I felt, they still remain, it genuinely hurts, hurts so much that I've attempted suicides over it, it is as if someone very very close to you died except that they never existed at all, for anyone else atleast, almost every other day I warm tears rolling down my cheeks at random occasion, often in those where I'm smiling, for a few years I cried and cried over it but unil a couple years ago I had never attempted suicide, mostly because atleast I remembered them, this all happened between the ages of 11 -13
Then eventually I found books and his myself in them running away from the (relatively very small) abuse and the problem of dealing with my emotions, I read some 300-400 books in the next 3 or so years, probably as a defence my mind had forgotten most of the traumatic experiences that never physically experienced.
But slowly things started getting worse, I was forced to put the books and everything away in my 10th grade, it's an important year, the exams in this year were important for jobs and stuff (or atleast that's the shit we were told). The condition started to worsen here but I passed through, the next year went fine too, I was basically still running away from my mental issues constantly using masturbation to supply me dopamine highs( I mean like when it got serious I masturbated to even 18-20 times a day,I also made sure my zinc supply in the food was high.)
But in 12, last year (I was 17) I couldn't handle it anymore, almost every day I have cried, i have slit my wrists so many times it resembles burn scars more than it resembles cuts.
I tried to hang myself quite a few times last year, since then I have and because of the dream death has become as ordinary for me as going to sleep, I have stood up on ledges of my apartment to make sure it wasn't just me exaggerating facts and Just so, I felt no fear, at that time I used to stop myself through the arguments of guilt about how my life is not mine it's of the people that I love.. yada yada.
But nowadays my memories don't feel like mine, I can't remember half my childhood, over time the arguments have lost their effects and I am on a course of certain self destruction, as of no I draw (almost all day) to run away from things but I'm 100% sure that the next time I feel stressed or perhaps any of those feelings return I will kill myself, even if I don't I will probably give into some delusions and beliefs and go insane.
I deny to believe in god, he probably doesn't exist but just in case he does and I meet him I'm gonna kick that motherfucker in the balls and to his death,
Strong sentiments I know 🤦🏻‍♂️ but seriously even if he does exist, there is absolutely no chance of me having any kind of faith in him.
P.S.   I'm talking about all this now because shits going south again, its... Let's just say.. all the cameras on my devices are covered in tape and I keep looking for cameras in my house even though partly as a game.
     Also, I know all this is probably extremely unbelievable or atleast seems highly exaggerated but trust though I can't promise you it's all true, everything I'm telling you is exactly as is from my memory of these events.

Btw I needed your opinions on what I should actually do with my life, and why is it worth seeing a whole life through again.",01Jun2020,1

Recently i was able to get better, and i was planning going to school again, but yesterday something happend, that i can't get of my mind,  i think my online friends are abandoning me, theyre are my key to be happy everyday (i dont have anyone to talk in real life, so i just talk to my bestfriends online).

One of them blocked me from discord (i know him for 3 years), and refuse to talk to me (because i did a joke with one of my bestfriends,i was just joking about the computer of one of my friends who died,and he thinks that what i said was really asshole, this friend of mine who had the pc dead, he has depressed too, and his pc is everything to him, i think i was really an asshole, but my friend who blocked me, he was an asshole too, he always blocked me from discord, because he knows that i dont like when people ignore me, and I always cried and begged him to unblock me.), he is the onwer of the server where everyones talks, and he banned me too (today he unbaned me), but he doens't let me talk to the others (he put me in a role where i can just see the messages, but i cant talk), all of my friends just talk  to him, and i dont have any way of talking to them right now (By the way, hes not a kid, he is 18 years old).

I have a girlfriend who gets heartbroken every time I get like it. My thoughts manipulate the truth and makeup lies and it hurts our relationship sometimes which makes me feel worse most the time.

It’s like I lose sense of myself when I see/text/call anyone. I feel everything they say, think, or do so intensely. Why am I like this and how can I stop it?

I especially feel like I need to recharge after I visit/call/text my Mum. Our relationship’s really good (it was what my ex-counsellor called “emotionally abuse” for a while a couple of years ago, but the bad things have stopped since I moved out.) I love my Mum, but I feel so overwhelmed whenever I have contact with her - I feel like I lose myself because I’m scared things will go bad between us again.

It also doesn’t help my empath overwhelmed feeling as I feel like I carry Mum and all her problems/opinions everywhere with me.

The movement of Black Lives Matter is about conveying a message. POC want their voices to be heard. DLC wants their voices to be heard. 

DLC was going to interview Lisa B today about yoga and anxiety but she asked if we could postpone the chat(TBD) She is also a journalist &amp; video producer who seeks to tell stories that matter. She came to me with an idea of using the DLC platform to tell YOUR stories.

We are reaching out to POC to submit a video of yourself answering either: what do you want people to really know, how are you feeling, how can we move forward? We ask to please keep it short (under 15 seconds) so we can include many voices. 

We hope to educate &amp; inform others in a non violent way with a video montage. Remember: This is your voice. Your voices will be heard. Speak out for what matters.

Have you ever felt strong emotions overtake your mind a body to the point that everything is rushing through your mind like a wild stampede of antelope running down a mountain? Understanding mental health is sometimes confusing. 

I have been dealing with mental health issues for a long time. I am just now realizing how much of a battle this is.

At my current age of 24, I have tried to voice my concerns with my mom. Ideally, your mom would be the one you talk to when issues arise in your life. You're supposed to feel safe and comfortable talking to your mom or any other adult that close to you. 

What if, you talk to that important person and they don't listen? Better yet, what if that person doesn't care to acknowledge what is being told to them? 

In my life, I have lived through many traumas. Some of those traumas she knows about and there are some she has no clue about. She once told me to watch a documentary about a child that was abused and killed by his mother and her boyfriend. She told me to watch that show so ""I would know the signs of someone being abused"". 

I was infuriated. I said ""what about the times I was Raped. What about the times, that family friend made me feel uncomfortable by the way he would hug and kiss me, what about the times I told you I felt alone and needed an adult to talk to and guide me, what about the time my aunt's then-boyfriend grabbed my by my waist and pulled me in so tight I couldn't get away. What about the fear you made me have towards my father? Always threatening me not to tell him those type of things because he would get mad and punish me. What about how you sheltered me most of my life that I didn't know how to socialize? I have felt so dumb my whole life. What about the fact that when I was in 6-8 grade there were multiple boys in that school that would grab me in inappropriate areas. What about the fact that you would call me a slut/ whore for years. How you told my boyfriend to run away from me. How you made me believe I was not good enough, you made me feel like what I had to say didn't matter.""


I have lived the majority of my life feeling alone, unimportant and useless. 


It's very difficult trying to help yourself when you don't have the support of the ones that you wish you did. 


The only support I have is from my boyfriend, my father (who I have started to build a relationship with), and my little sister. 

It is so difficult to talk to my mother ( the person I wish I had the support of) but what good is it that she will not even apologize for anything.

I don't feel things like normal people, I think. 

I think I don't feel. I want to feel. I think I used to, many years ago. 

TV shows make me feel nothing, video games make me feel nothing. Meeting new people makes me feel nothing. Sex makes me feel nothing. Graduating made me feel nothing. Drugs make me feel nothing. Hurting myself makes me feel nothing. Hurting others makes me feel nothing. People dying makes me feel nothing. People being happy makes me feel nothing. 
No matter what I do, there's nothing. No one helps, nothing helps. I don't care about anything or anyone. I want to care. I want to know what it feels like to want.

226," **TLDR: My cousin's dad is a sociopath (has literally tried to kill his older brothers before), and the fact that everyone but him in the family knows is tearing me apart, and stopping me from having a relationship with him like we did when we were kids. I don't know what to do about it.**

So I was raised around my three male cousins. The three of them were siblings, but I may as well have been the fourth. Literally 80% of my interests that I have today as an adult are because of them - they'd be over every single weekend, and they never bullied me, always included me on EVERYTHING despite being a girl (the oldest, who's 5 years older than me, would even say, ""If you two aren't letting [u/CaliBounded](https://www.reddit.com/u/CaliBounded/) play, we're turning the video games off."" I loved them dearly, and we were around eachother ALL the time until Hurricane Katrina hit. We're all from New Orleans, and had to move across the country from eachother in different states after the storm. I'd see the older two once or twice a year in the earlier years (they have a different mom than the youngest one - let's call them A, B, and C), but eventually, we'd see eachother every two years.

Even still, I saw C every SINGLE year, multiple times a year, because he lived in New Orleans where my grandparents were (who we'd visit somewhat often). C and I may as well have been twins, we were so inseparable. We told eachother about our boy and girl issues (people we liked), complained about our parents, shared our goals and supported eachother. I could tell him literally anything. But there's some huge secrets surrounding C that just about all of our family knows about that C doesn't.

**A, B and C's dad is a homocidal, greedy, cheating, lying sociopath.** And I'm not exaggerating in the slightest. A and B, as I mentioned previously, are from the same mother. He not only regularly cheated on her, but abused her emotionally and physically. A, B and C's dad does this to all of the women he dates, punching and pushing his previous wife before A and B's mom out of car going about 6 miles an hour while she was pregnant with his first child (A, B and C are the second, third, and fourth children). One of A's earliest memories is doing his best to wake his mom up because A and B's dad lit their house on fire while A and B (who were toddlers at the time) and their mother were inside. A and B's mother was wealthy, and he wanted all of her money. While A and B's mom was in the hospital from this incident, he took her credit cards and ran her 50k into debt, and crashed her convertible (which he used to pick up women in - another one of A's earliest set of memories is being in the houses of women that his father was cheating on his mother with). While A and B's mom was recovering in the hospital, he visits her and tells her that he's been cheating on her, is about to marry the new woman, and that she is pregnant with his child. She does not call the cops on him for this because he'd been convincing her for years that he knew people on the police force and that they'd never believe her - he did not.

C is born as a result of this union, and my mother and C's siblings love him to death (C is a year older than me, so this happens before I'm even born). Skip forward a few years to our childhood - because my own parent is a narcissist (A, B and C's dad and my mother are certainly siblings... she made an attempt on my life at 17 and I haven't spoken to her since) and likes to gossip, she lets me in on all this stuff by the age of like, 7 years old. My relationship with C begins to get a little harder to maintain, because as the years go by, I'm being informed of more and more terrible things that their dad did, and C has no idea. I have had so many slip-ups because I forget what parts of the story or facts about his own life that he does or does not know about. ""It doesn't help that C is kind of a know-it-all, and used to say ignorant shit like, ""Sometimes I think A and B are mad because my dad divorced their mom and married my mom."" and he has no clue what actually happened, or how he came to be. Into our teen years, my grandmother got dimentia. My mother did a lot of work to put her in one of the best homes in our state that would make sure that she was taken care of. My uncle (A and B's dad) took her out on the pretense that he ""wanted what was best for her"", when really, he wanted to steal my grandmother's money. Thankfully, my mother and grandfather, before putting my grandmother in a home, changed her bank codes so that he couldn't do that, and that's how they found out - the bank reported suspicious activity with my grandmother and my uncle at one of their locations, suspecting elder abuse.

A terrible legal battle follows where my uncle tries to get Power of Attorney (legal gurdianship over my grandmother, who is deemed incompetent). My mom fights and fights for it, but loses because of my uncle's proximity to her (he lived in New Orleans and we did not). Even though it was my mother and I who cleaned out her entire house, that upon visiting, had dog hair all over the walls, canned food two years past the expiration date, etc. It was traumatizing being 14 and doing all of this for a woman who used to be so strong and took care of me growing up. Having her forget my name. I remember it all. Which is what made me stop speaking to C - C knows that my mother is abusive. But because he knows nothing about his father, he thinks that he's better than my mother. One day, I was telling him about some abusive things that she was doing, and he goes, ""Well, you have to understand, this is the sort of thing your mom does, you know? You probably don't know that she was trying to steal grandma's money? My dad had to get into a legal battle with her over it!"" I was literally there when the bank sent us an alert. I was literally there, in person, for a lot of terrible things my uncle has done. I was there cleaning out her home, helping prepare to get her moved into a place where she would be taken care of. He is so out of touch with how terrible his father is that I couldn't talk to him anymore.

The worst part is that because he's a know-it-all, you can't just change the subject off of our parents - he'll keep on insisting we talk about it, and ask why we're changing the subject about my ""Terrible mother"". I'm not defending my mother in any way - she *is* terrible. But after living in a home with her where she was awful to me and lying to everyone about it, I am dead-set on living a life without lies, family secrets, etc. (A is the only relative I still speak to in my family after the incident with my mother). My mother is awful, but she would have NEEEEEVER abused my grandmother. Taking care of your elderly parents is INCREDIBLY important in New-Orleanean culture. I was THERE at the court battle (was asked to testify) for her power of attorney and literally watched my uncle lie on events that I was physically there for. I'm less offended that he's insulting my mother and more offended that he actually thinks his demon of a father is a good person. I've tried just telling him, ""That's not true. I can't tell you why, and I can tell you one day, but not now."", or simply, ""I don't want to talk about this, I'll talk about it one day"", and he either gets angry because he's heard this from everyone in his life already, or he thinks I'm being condescending. Even his own grandmother knows (my mother and grandmother tried to warn everyone they could about my uncle, and that C's mom shouldn't marry him, but he'd gotten into hear head and told her that we're ""just jealous"" - C's grandma told C's mom not to marry him too, and didn't listen).

I just stopped talking to him one day. I still love my cousin. I miss having my best friend. I miss having someone that was so supportive. I just had to cut him off because I couldn't go on having him not know. I'm going to talk to my therapist about this soon (a lot of other stuff has been going on, so I haven't had the ability to speak to him) but it hurts my heart that I can't have a relationship with him anymore because I can't handle keeping a secret for people. I asked A when we were ever going to tell him (this is HIS father, not mine, and I don't feel like it's my place to do so, and I'd rather have his blessing before saying anything), and he tentatively said, ""When he graduates college, I guess...?"" I'm 23 now, and C is 24, but he's in the middle of a degree that will probably take around 7 years (we imagine this is so he doesn't let his parents in on the fact that he knows/have this explode his perception of life as he knows it while he's pursuing his studies). He's got a good two more years to go before he's done, and I don't want to wait that long. I already used to think about him from time to time, but Coronavirus has really made me reach out to people that I haven't contacted much and keep them closer.

231,"I’ve been skinny my entire life, and always teetered on the edge of being underweight. Part of the reason why I managed to stay so thin was because I have an eating disorder and I would closely monitor my weight and restrict whenever I put on a few pounds. However, taking birth control and antidepressants have caused me to gain around 30 lbs in total, and even though I’m still a healthy weight, I don’t feel like myself. I went from being around 132-138 on average to 160 (I’m also 5’8).

I go back and forth multiple times a day being in love with my new curvy figure and absolutely loathing it. There are parts that I adore, and don’t want to lose the weight because of the risk of losing them. I went from being hardly an A cup to a B, and having absolutely no ass to having a big ass for the first time ever. Looking back at old pictures of myself from when I was thin makes me want to crawl in a hole because I’m so much bigger now. I’m not sure if I should try to lose the weight I gained or try to make peace with it. I’m aware that many people would probably envy my figure even how it is now, and some people pay a lot of money to look the way I do. Nobody has a problem with the way my body looks except for me, and I don’t know how to get over it.

I've tried seeking help two years ago but it actually made things worse, my parents act like the doctor never told them I had depression and they get angry at me for always being sad and not motivated, even though I try so hard to not disappoint them, some days I just can't.
I just needed to take this out of my chest, you don't need to reply, if you've read through this, I'm sorry.",01Jun2020,2
233,"With this whole COVID-19 going on my mental health has been declining , I wake up everyday feeling sad and feeling like a failure. I'm 22 years old and I still don't know what career I want to go into and when I think about my future I get really sad, anxious and that I won't go very far in life. I don't know if I should go back to school and just improve on my math and english skills or if I should pick a career and go into that field. I feel like this world is falling apart and my mental health on top of that isn't helping me at all. I guess you could say that I'm feeling really stuck and depressed. I don't know anything and I don't know what to do.",01Jun2020,1

Sorry for the length. Basically I've(21f) been thinking about this nonstop since it happened and want to get it out. Not sure where or if this is a good place. 

In February we got a phone call that my grandma was put in hospital and was on life support. My mom told me this and I arranged for both of us and my sister to fly out to be with my grandparents because things sounded bad but we didnt know the extent yet. I managed to buy the next flight( to another country), booked a hotel and convinced my boss and school I needed a week off with the potential of more depending on how things went. I did this even though my sister and mother have had an  abusive history towards me. It's mainly emotionally but sometimes become physical as well. My mom in particular has used parentification throughout my life but I ignored all of this for my grandmothers sake. 

I felt in that moment it was more important to see my grandma and it wasn't my place to stop them from seeing her as well. Honestly I'm not even sure how I managed to be around them that much in the moment but looking back I was probably in fixer mode as I'm used to being in my family. I'm not too sure as my memory of the time is fuzzy.
We arrived at the hospital straight from the airport and at that point I hadn't slept in at least 48hrs. We were informed that my grandmother was in a coma and her body was shutting down. Within a couple hours a specialist was called down to meet with us to tell us the outlook which was not good. She said that my grandmother had brain damage and her body stopped producing heat which caused all of her limbs to die. And the chances of her waking was slim but if she did she would need all of them amputated and had the potential to be blind. On top of this was the potential for any unknown side effects of the brain damage. It was devastating to hear and so unexpected as she was fine 2 days before.

The specialist asked my (step)grandpa and mother if they wanted to continue with aggressive treatment or remove the machine intervention and wait and see how things went. My grandpa who has early stage alzheimers told my mother that it was ultimately her decision what to do. 

My mother shut down. When asked what she wanted by my grandpa then again by the doctors she only would reply, ""no thank you."" Repeatedly she would not give an answer and my sister was manic and not apart of the conversation. It was frustrating but not surprising. It followed my moms pattern of behavior to not take responsibility of anything. She stared at me while the doctors got frustrated with her lack of response and had already told me privately she thought my grandma was already dead and gone. Things were getting more and more tense. 

And so I stepped in and told the doctors that the best thing would be to make my grandma as comfortable as possible and take the chance without the machines. And so I gave the final consent to unplug my grandma. I told the doctors to stop interfering and allow her to die. 
She only lasted a couple of minutes on her own.
So her death is on my hands. I can't stop thinking this. It's been constantly on my mind. I mean I didnt have to step in but I feel I did not have a choice. I feel she forced me to make this decision and to take on this responsibility so she didnt have to. It might sound weird but I feel like I'm too young to have the responsibility when there were older adults involved. 

And now she has asked me to be the one to organize the funeral and to speak to my grandmas lawyer on my moms behalf about the will. Because of Corona this was all pushed back until now and my mom is pressuring me to do this for her. I've told her no and explained it was not my place to do that for her but she keeps asking and pressing me. She disagrees with my grandpa over the final arrangements and wants me to step in and fight him about it on her behalf. But I cant and wont. 

I have PTSD following the death of my father 3 yrs ago. Which was made worse by the death of my (other) grandma last yr. And now I feel that these events with my mom and grandma has triggered a relapse and it's getting worse. At the time initially after I was devoid of emotion but as time has progressed I've had more and more intrusive thoughts of guilt. My mom doesn't believe I have PTSD or in the existence of mental illness in general. So it would mean nothing to her if I told her shes made mine worse. Another small part of me thinks that I've the situation a bigger deal than it is in my mind and she didnt really do anything wrong and it's normal for parents to ask their kid for help. Am I wrong to think in some way it's not right? And to be angry at her for asking so much of me? 

Anyway if this is read by anyone thank you. I really just needed to rant about it. And sorry if there is any mistakes as its difficult to get out.",01Jun2020,2
