0,"I live with my parents and older brother. My older brother is prone to lashing out, throwing things, getting mad at the littlest of things (even if it’s his fault), etc. I tried asking if he was okay and he said everything is fine when clearly it’s not. When someone does something for him (eg. Our mom will always make dinner) he will still be in a bad mood and be unappreciative. 

How do I go about this? He’s an adult and I don’t think other people should be responsible for fixing all his problems. But he’s not willing to do anything that will make things better for himself. It also gets very uncomfortable to have to live in the same house as him.",18Apr2020,1
1,"Usually I can keep it upbeat and happy all day at work, but when night comes I am buffeted with a wave of loneliness. I miss my high school friends. Now we’ve grown up and apart. I have at least.

Out of boredom I scroll through social media and see my old classmates’ posts. Their pictures with each other and their significant others. Meanwhile I sit here alone. I feel like a fading memory.

I’m damaged and I know it. I’m left wondering whether it’s my fault. Am I an asshole? I question everything I say or do now. I want friends. I assume people fade because they sense that I’m not being my genuine self. Hell, I don’t even know my genuine self outside of being a funny guy.

All my friends eventually forget me. They exclude me. No matter how hard I try. I want to blame them, but that just seems like me wanting to pass on responsibility. I want to get better. I want to stop being lonely. 


TLDR: I walk this empty street on the boulevard of broken dreams.",18Apr2020,1
2,"When I was 4, my cousin (also 4) and I were inseparable. We played games like house, Lego, and zoo. The games be played always were a bit.. strange. At least on his part. He look lick our “baby” (a doll) in the private parts. I didn’t think of it. We are 2nd cousins and he had a crush on me. We were both little and didn’t understand what “crush” meant. The games we played got weirder, and sometimes he would make me kiss him. One day, the most vivid memory, (We were probably 5) we were pretending to sleep in our game of house. He told me to come here. He threw things at me and hurt me when he got mad, so I came over. He told me to kid him. I said no. He asked me again. I said no. He grabbed me, put a thin see through cloth between our lips and pulled me on top of him. I laid on top of him as he did something. That’s all I remember. It turns out, he was sexually abused by HIS cousin, so he thought that was how you showed someone love. I don’t know if he remembers. But I do. I see him all the time. I am scared of him. I am only in 6th grade, so I need to tell someone about this? Is it bad or not? I have depression and anxiety.",18Apr2020,1
3,"I’ve temporarily moved back in with my parents during this time to avoid the germs from the city I live in. I’ve been here for about a month or so and things have been better than I expected with my family, up until tonight. 

My mom is a bad alcoholic and she’s thankfully been sober the last two years, but that doesn’t erase any of my anger, resentment and hurt I have, as growing up with an alcoholic isn’t easy. She was always mean, mistrusting and judgmental when she was drunk, which was sadly most of the time, so it was hard for me to ever bond with her on a close level. 

Even though it has been pretty good and neutral since being here, tonight it flipped and became awful. Since getting sober, she’s development an eating disorder (something my therapist says is her “new addiction”) and is really mean about my weight.

I’m a 23 year old, five foot six female that weighs around 125 pounds - so I’m very very average and really don’t give her any reason to be mean about my weight. I eat well and moderately exercise. But she still nags me about it as I guess any mother would, to eat more healthily etc. tonight though she told me I was fat and to stop eating. 

I’ve been struggling with my body image for a while as this is the biggest I’ve ever been in my life and even though I know I’m not “fat” I’m adjusting to my new body. And this just doesn’t help.

I’m so upset and don’t want this to discourage me from my self love journey I’ve been on. 

How can I feel better and handle these situations better?",18Apr2020,1
4,"This is my experience and i don't know if it's a good idea to share it here but i just really want to get some things off my chest and please, if you've been through the same thing i'd like to hear your experiences too. I just feel like my brain it's wrong. It's a bit embarrassing to say these things here but it's the internet after all, am i right. When i was a kid i used to have some notebooks where i used to wrote different things or questions i was anxious about and, it's weird i don't even know how to explain. Questions and different things would've popped out in my mind and i couldn't feel well till i didn't write those things down. It was distressing i was just a little kid, i was 8 or 9 maybe. I used to check the gas and the door everytime but this thing stopped concerning me after a few years. Last year i had some random pain in my body, in the pelvic area specifically and i got so anxious about it i started to search symptoms only just to reassure myself that nothing was wrong with me and different questions about these symptoms were popping out in my brain.. again and i felt trapped in my own thoughts. That i was in a circle where i get anxious, then i need to reasure myself then i got anxious about other thing, etc. I stopped with this thing too after a few months, it came back but it didn't last long. And now i just overthink everything. I've always done that i get anxious and i feel like i need reassurance from people about specific things that i have to ask things multiple times so i can be sure that a certain thing won't happen. I don't know what it is i don't understand this brain. Sorry about this long ass rant but i needed to say these things.",18Apr2020,1
5,"My older brother is 30 years old. Growing up, he was always a quiet kid, but I didn't think much of it. Sometime around age 22, I noticed some changes and things have just gotten more bizarre as time goes on. 

Currently, he lives with our mom and has been unemployed for 1.5 years. He hasn't taken a shower since Thanksgiving 2019. He takes 2-3 hours to eat dinner. He has lost tons of weight and his BMI is about 18.0. It seems like he isn't even in the same realm as the rest of the world. He will just walk around the house and stare intensely at the floor like he's seeing something on the ground. I went to visit my mom's house and happened to go in his room. It is filled with garbage, rotten food, and there were even about 5-6 water bottles full of piss. I'm certain he is a hoarder. About 2 years ago was when I first noticed this, so I took all of his trash and bagged it up and took it to a fast food dumpster. Later that night I saw him leave the house and was suspicious so I followed him and he was in the dumpster retrieving his trash to take back home. I've had talks with my mom and she just won't do anything about it. She's in declining health and still supports him. It's starting to anger me because 1) He lives with my mom rent free, doesn't work, and has destroyed his side of the house 2) It's a health risk to my other siblings that live there. I've tried to talk with him but he's just very unresponsive and rarely talks to anyone. 

Now, how should I approach this? I want to  truly help. I love my brother &amp; my entire family, I want to to try to approach this in a way that helps everyone. I think I'm the only one in my family that will actually take initiative to get something done. I just have no idea where to go from here...",18Apr2020,1

What if a spider crawls up my bed one night and I wake up with it on my face, or anywhere else on my body, huh? What if some psychopath just comes in one day and straight up kills me or kidnaps me? I just CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT THESE FUCKING THINGS. There's nothing I can do to stop it. My sleeping schedule's been fucked for over a month now.

No matter how much coffee. Energy drinks. My fatigue is relentless. I got my labs done the doctor said nothing looks concerning. I had been told that my depression is most likely from severe add which makes a lot of sense. But I hate myself. I can’t ever seem to live up to my potential. Follow through with things. And the person I want to be and who I am are just not close. I feel like I don’t have the energy to go through daily tasks. I was diagnosed with mdd. Prozac did wonders for me. But then it stopped and did nothing. My mom dad and brother are extreme heroine and meth addicts and every time I take adderall I break it up into tiny pieces and take it because I’m to scared to be an addict and don’t want to be using a substance to make me feel like I’m doing better if it’s drug induced delusion of doing better.

14,"Hello, I’m a 21 year old female and let me give you some background information about my past. So high school was a living hell for me. I was a shitty person as well as a hot mess. I was really mean to a lot of my friends and I was super abusive as well. During high school I was in a relationship with a guy. We were both horrible to each other. We would break up get back together and he would sexually touch me when I didn’t ask him too. I would also verbally abuse him too. I also had horrible grades in high school I never did any of my work. I was bullied a lot all throughout school. After I graduated high school I left that all behind me. I changed a lot as a person. I got a job that I really love working with animals. I started to go to college and making really good grades. I have a 3.5 gpa now. I left the guy I was dating and 8 months later I started dating someone else. My current relationship is great we get along super well both very happy in the relationship. It feels like a real relationship. I love him very much, he’s showed me how to live a beautiful life. I also cut off my toxic friendships from high school. Their pretty pissed at me for it, but I’m really glad their gone. I feel weight lifted off of me. One of my old friends and my Ex bf are going around spreading rumors about me saying stuff that I never did/said. Not all my friendships in high school were toxic. Some of my friends we just drifted apart, because we had not a whole lot in common anymore. I still love them dearly haven’t talked to them in a really long time. I’m still really good friends with one girl. We have a lot in common and we been friends since middle school. She’s super sweet we hangout a good amount. Life has gotten better after high school. Just one thing is I can’t let the past go. I’m obsessed with thinking about the past. I think about it all the time. I get flash backs of things I did that were horrible or horrible things that happened to me. I’m so embarrassed in myself, because of it. It makes me extremely depressed, even having thoughts of hurting myself. Every time see someone from my past out in public I get really nervous, because they will remember from what I was like back then. I feel very guilty in what I have done to people in high school. I hate myself for my past I knew I was a asshole back then. I don’t know whats wrong with me. I work on myself all the time. I’m in therapy right know, but had to stop due to quarantine. I really want to work in the mental health felid in the future and help teens. I’m just scared I won’t be able to handle it, because once I hear something similar about my past I get all shaken up about it. I don’t know what to do?",18Apr2020,1

20,"For as long as I can remember I've wanted to be anywhere but home.

As a kid I used to fantasize about running away. I used to research the fuck out of it and I got into bushcraft and basic survival skills as a result. I've never felt like I really belonged somewhere. 

One of my earliest memories is saying to my dad that I wanted to run away. I remember just sitting with him while he watched tv. He acknowledged me but just didn't seem to care. I don't know if it's just me though.

Up until recently I'd forgotten that I'd written a suicide/running away note that I kept hidden in my room when I was a kid.

I just don't get it. I've always wanted to just leave home and get as far away as I can. To escape from my family. But they care about me, we live in a decent house, we aren't poor. I hate it though. 

I feel like some spoiled piece of shit.

I've had issues with my family since being a teenager. Especially with my dad. I think he was emotionally abusive but how do I know I'm not the one in the wrong?

I've never been able to take myself seriously. 

My sister seems fine though, she really loves my parents and is quite close to them. I can't understand it though. 

Why do I feel estranged from them? Why do I want to leave and forget I ever belonged to this family? Why has this tormented me for my entire life?


I'm 22 and stuck with my parents during this pandemic and I can't deal with it. I'm so depressed most of the time. I can hardly function. 

I try anything to try and have a good day but I just want to get as far away from everyone and everything as possible. My parents always find a way to make me feel ashamed of myself or make me feel like some false version of me. Like I'm some pathetic imitation of a person and everything I do is stupid.

I can hardly interact with my dad because my level of distrust towards him is so great. I struggle to be in the same room as him, but he just wants to do things with me.

One of my few escapes was music. I play guitar to deal with things, but now they've invaded that space. They've invaded all the space I have and not even my mind feels like it's private. They're always listening and passing judgement and trying to make me someone that I'm not.

My dad wants me to teach him to play guitar, but I really don't want to. It's like the last thing that I have control over. The last thing I have that is mine.

My mum always micromanges me and keeps tabs on what I'm doing and how much I'm eating. She always tells me I'm doing this or that wrong or not enough.

I don't know if I'm being ungrateful and shitty. My mum just cares about me and my dad wants to spend time with me but I just don't want that. I want to get as far away as possible.

I know there has to be more to it but I don't know what. Why has this just defined my life?

There's a lot I'm not sure about. I don't feel much enjoyment anymore.

I just wish I could feel like a normal human being and enjoy all the normal things that other people enjoy. Like a family that I feel like I belong to, functional long term relationships, friendship groups I feel like I can belong to, not having to gamble my future to feel like I have meaning.

I feel like my experience of being human is so unlike what it's supposed to be like.

I'm single don't have any kids work a job that I hate and it just feels like this is just the rest of my life like I can't start something new or I'm too old and people want someone young full of energy whereas I'm not out of energy but I don't have that spunk I used to. I see these younger people who are just starting their lives and all I can feel is envy and desire to be that age again to be in a position where if I were to screw up, I could rebound easier.

I also can't help but feel a bit jealous seeing a younger generation enjoy things without being ostracized like gaming as well as DnD and overall geek culture stuff that when I was their age generally made you an outcast from public is now considered the social norm and only thing going through my head is I had only been born a little bit later maybe I would have had a group to hang out with when I was younger. Part of me understands the only reason that's normal now is cause my generation grew up and made it the norm we didn't want people to go through the same pains we did from being shunned but at the same token I still can't help but feel jealous about it.

Throughout my entire life I've always been a late bloomer I didn't even have friends until I was 26 It feels like I'm behind age wise by a good ten years but I should be feeling now is something I’m not going to feel till I'm 44 And I don't know what to do about it I feel like I'm trapped torn between What I want to versus the knowledge to know I'm too old to be doing it that it is not my place to be there that it is not right for me to join such things.

I was doing good for the last couple of weeks going outside in nature and stuff to keep me sane but the weather where I live has been horrible and I haven't gone outside in a week. I live in Michigan, which is one of the strictest states for stay at home orders in the country. I guess I'll give a bit of backstory or something, idk.

I graduated high school last year, June of 2019. I was 17 (18 now), and excited for the world ahead of me. I had commited to join the US Navy and was really excited for it. I knew it was going to be hard and probably suck for most of the way through, but I knew that it was my opprotunity to make a big impact on SOMEBODY's life. Summer came and went, it was the best summer of my life. I saw the country, got to spend a lot of time with friends. Just simple, good, carefree fun.

September came, time to go to bootcamp. I went, stayed there for 3 months, it sucked but that's the whole point. I made it to the last week, before failing my final run. I got seperated the day after Christmas. At this point I was pretty bummed out, but I at least knew I tried my best.

Few weeks pass, looking for a job, etc. Can't find one. More time passes, I am feeling more down but remain optimistic. I eventually find a job a few states over at an amusement park, something I always thought would be fun to do during college or something, and thought fuck it I'm 18 why not. Things started to look less bleak.

And then coronavirus happened. My whole life felt like it got put on pause. Stay at home orders were issued, and I slowly watched the world around me go into a state of fear and suffering. I had to stay inside a lot now. No more seeing friends. I was ok for a couple weeks, but eventually my thoughts caught up with me. I got really existential. The more I thought about it the more I realized how fucked up the society we live in is. It didn't help that the leader of our country blew the whole thing over. I feel terified. I feel like our government should be in a state of assuring us that we will be ok, yet I felt the opposite. Their actions made me for fearful.

I started to think to myself, what even is the point of all of this? Of life? I realized how meaningless life is, and it just seems like we are all born to suffer. Fuck. I was so happy and carefree just a few months ago, are we all really so stupid and vulnerable that we let things like this take us over so quickly?

Even now, years later, I have a hard time actually moving or doing anything out of a fear of something randomly happening. Back at home, if I was doing something ""wrong"" if the birth givers eyes, she would suddenly start slapping me and verbally abusing me. 

I'm on meds that work well. They keep the worst of it at bay. I've had a cocktail of different medications through the years and these seem to help the most. So I'm not wanting to change them just yet. I have a therapist (behavioral health specialist) and a psychologist that I see. I even do YOGA and try to eat right. I eat mostly rice with veggies, don't drink or smoke.

My teeth are ruined from the lack of care. I KNOW it's gross. I think a part of my brain just shut down and stopped seeing them, and honestly, for the first few years they were fine. It's only been in the last year that they've literally started chipping away looking worse than Gollom's set of teeth. There's almost an aversion to brushing. Sometimes I can trick myself when I take a shower to do it, but I'm still down to only brushing once a week, maybe a little more. 

I just want to be free of this. What's so wrong with these chemicals in my brain that keep me from being able to live?",18Apr2020,7
44,Hope everyone’s holding up well. I need some advice on how to deal with stored up anger. I’ve been working diligently on bettering my mental health over the Past year and a half but I think there’s an underlying layer of anger that I need to let loose before I can truly move forward. I’ve been pretty active in the gym on and off for a good 7 years and it helps temporarily but not completely. And I find myself overcompensating by trying to be too nice and too kind even when I  really want to tell people to fuck off. So I probably come across as fake or at least not sincere because I can’t express that later deep down. How can I get this off my shoulders without just lashing out because I feel like I’m almost at that point.,18Apr2020,1
45,I dont know anymore. Ive lived all my life with a narcissist and i always used to use college and work as an escape to get away from the negative environment in my place of living. During this quarantine ive been forced to be around my narcissistic abuser more and i cant deal with the verbal abuse anymore. Im not gonna even bother writing my whole story here. I just wanted to emphasize how tough this quarantine has been. I cant escape. I dont know. Its saturday and i have to be up in the morning knowing that ill have the whole day with verbal abuse again and i wont be able ro concentrate on my college stuff. All i keep thinking about is suicide. I want to but im not strong enough to go ahead and do it. i rather be dead right now. I really do.,18Apr2020,1

47,"I don’t know if this has ever happened to any of you people but most of the time now since the quarantine my head has been filled with negative thoughts and negative memories just filling up my brain. Probably because I can’t get out it’s effecting my mental health but honestly I don’t know how to stop it it’s like when I’m not busy I get a random thought and it’s always negative and I’m like why?, why? Do I think like this. I was actually thinking of buying a diary to write my feeling and thoughts but haven’t got round to it. Has this ever happened to any of you guys? It’s either negative thoughts of what what’s happened in the past i tend to listen to music to distract me but never always works since it just happened even talking about this is hard. Idk if it’s a sign of illness I ain’t sure what do u think ?",18Apr2020,1
48,I wish I had someone to go to but this will do. My mental health hasn’t been doing very good and I’ve been thinking I need to talk to someone or at least do something. But I don’t know what to do. Anytime I’ve tried to talk to my mother (single parent) about how I’m feeling she just assumes when I say I don’t feel good I’m depressed and or want to kill myself. I’m turning 18 in a week or so and I’m just lost. Any advice is appreciated.,18Apr2020,3
49,"I know covid and quarantining is getting to everyone, so I just feel like I’m being dramatic.

But I constantly fantasize about suicide and it’s gotten exceptionally worse during all of this. I did have an attempt in 2018, obvi didn’t work bc here I am.

I can’t admit it to my therapist bc i just can’t say the words out loud. But I have a massive amount of sleeping pills I’ve just been hoarding and picking up monthly and barely taking them as well as some Xanax- I still do take those though. All I can think about is just swallowing them all with vodka. The thoughts are always there but they’re getting so much louder and worse. I cannot do it right now bc I would never want to overwhelm the hospital with one more thing with all of this going on. But, I feel like with all of this time at home I can just keep fantasizing and maybe when this pandemic is over I can just get it over with. 

I just wish I knew how to not feel like this and not have so many of my thoughts preoccupied with this. I just needed to share somewhere because I have no one I can tell. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m 27, I haven’t accomplished nearly anything and I just feel like I never will. I’m not “depressed” per say but I’m severely unhappy with myself and have had a very hard life that never seems to get better. I just want the thoughts to stop or I just want it to all end alrdy. I wish I could tell my therapist but I just don’t think I can. I’m not sure if it’s something she could send me away for. Idk what to do anymore. Thanks if anyone reads this.",18Apr2020,1

51," Brain fog is actually a symptom not a disease and is defined as the inability to have a sharp memory or to lack a sharp focus. You just really feel like you're not yourself and you're unable to think clearly this is called mental fogginess or what we call subsyndromal delirium or for short SSD.

55,"The act of writing is itself therapeutic, it is a release valve from the pressure of trauma long past. 

In this instance, writing saved my life. I was able to express tumult of my mind, to observe it, to accept it and ultimately to let it go.

Revisiting and sharing it brings it’s own pain. The raw vulnerability of presenting such a thing to the world borders upon the unbearable. Yet I persist, not because I think the poem itself is worth sharing, but because its worth comes by the way of example.

I hope that it will inspire people to release their inner demons, and to push through that inner voice that fears the words that are being put on the page.

Write, and write, and write some more. Write until it is all gone. Until you are empty. Then you will be free to be filled with beauty and love and life.

**Flashback**

There’s nowhere you can run to,   
Nowhere you can hide,   
Not when your problems   
Are coming from inside.  
   
You cannot escape them,   
You cannot leave,  
Now that blood is   
Running down your sleeve.  
   
Don’t try to face me,   
Don’t try to hide,  
Mummy, Daddy,   
Why weren’t you by my side?  
   
Do I want to sober up,   
Or do I want to die?   
Blank memories. Pain.   
Watching his hand touch up my thigh.  
   
I couldn’t say no,   
I couldn’t flee,  
Nothing I tried   
Broke his hold of me.  
   
Years have passed,   
But his grip remains,  
He took my body,   
My soul, my brains.  
   
So now I’m sitting here,   
Stoned and alone,  
Trying to remember   
If I have ever felt at home.",18Apr2020,1
56,"Backstory : My GF is 26 and wonderful, we actually have a great relationship, never really argue and certainly never fight or anything like that. She lost her mom back when she was in college (before we met) and that made a pretty significant and understandable dent in her mental health I think. Then before she and I hooked up she was dating a guy who put his hands on her a lot which (I think) has caused her to completely freak out and cower in fear from ME in situations where things are otherwise normal 

example : once we took a day trip up to the top of a mountain and her cars radiator busted on the way up, I pulled off and made a phone call to get a tow, she got out of the car and sat down beside it, as I’m hanging up the phone I’m walking towards her to tell her “tow trucks 20 min out love” and she completely freaked out and screamed like I was going to kick her in the face or something. I comforted her and told her everything was ok of course but later I asked her ya know “what the f*ck babe?” She said she has no idea what happened, I looked like a “dark figure” and her ear started to hurt really bad. This sort of thing has happened about bi monthly since we’ve been together. Thankfully never in a crowded place where people would CERTAINLY think I actively beat the shit out of her. 

Throughout our relationship she has had bouts with panic attacks, and maybe unrelated but worth mentioning she has chronic sinusitis and uses Affrin nasal spray sometimes 10-12x per day. She even wakes up in the middle of the night to take a hit of Affrin and then go back to sleep... that concerns me also. But may be for a different post. 

When she moved in with me that meant giving up her career at one of the bigger gyms in America, to move to a different state to be with me. She came here and her panic and anxiety seemed to vanish, she stopped having daily panic attacks and was happy and full of life, she found a job at another gym here in town and was eager and climbed from the ground up to a salaried position with a title in under 90 days, but now in the midst of covid 19 shut down she is the only employee still working. The gym has been shut down for weeks but they still make her go there everyday to take phone calls and do things that are arbitrary and pedantic imo. She is there from 8am - 5pm 6 days a week even though the gym is closed. I stop by sometimes as I’m an outdoor contractor and she’s just sitting in a gym that the owners won’t let her turn the lights or AC on inside, so it’s DARK and pretty uncomfortable in there. Anyway to get to the point here, she works from 8-5 then comes home and is asleep before 8pm every night. Then she sleeps all through the night until 7am then goes to work and sits in that box with the lights out for no reason... and I truthfully think it’s causing her to be seriously depressed. When she is home and is awake, she’s cold or doesn’t feel good, tired, complains of her chest hurting again... is working at gyms bad for my girlfriend? 

Upon her request, I had a talk with her gyms owner two days ago and asked him if they could forward the gyms calls to her cellphone and let her work from home since she has a work laptop with access to their intranet system. And he quickly declined stating “somebody has to be here to accept deliveries” although deliveries have not come since the shutdown, so that’s just not true. So I told him that and he said “somebody has got to be here” I said OKAY well how about since you gave 29 other employees temporary unemployment, you give it to her too? And he agreed. Next thing I know she’s calling me up saying she’s bombarded with emails from the owners with a laundry list of busy work tasks,  along with the “but if you want to be furloughed I guess that’s what we’ll do” basically guilt tripping her into being the only employee at work... sigh 

I genuinely think this is causing her to fall into a depression because all she does is go to work and sleep and not feel good when she’s awake. Meanwhile I have two careers and am building her dream car (old mustang) for her in my spare time, trying to spend any time with her is cut very short by her falling asleep the second she sits down at home. 

I’ve talked to her about everything I’ve mentioned here a few times and her answers are always “I don’t know what’s going on” but damnit somethings going on. Something is causing her to feel like garbage and be so tired and I want to try to help any way I can. I don’t expect her to be like me and be able to run off 5hr sleep every night and go full throttle everyday, but 11-13hr of sleep everyday is not only unusual for her, but seems unhealthy to me. Any advice on how I can help her would be appreciated. Thank you. 

[[TL:DR - My GF has had bouts of anxiety throughout our relationship, has a job that I think is causing her to be depressed because she is constantly sleeping when she’s home and sleeps for a long time. Basically work - sleep - repeat - talked to her about it, her response “I don’t know what’s going on” any advice on how I can help or what I can do for her appreciated. Thank you.]]",18Apr2020,2
57,"So is anybody else here tired of fighting it?

60,"There's something very strange about mental.health, you don't particularly feel depressed but you don't feel good either , your stuck on auto pilot , but your not really living . 

Your mental health and deprivation of any form of happiness and normality forms behaviours that only keep you stuck there.

It's only when you start to expand those limits that you start to recognise how.

Part of the issue is most of the time I'm completely on my own these days . I'm in and out of work . Lost contact with all old freinds , and am far from being in a position to want anything that resembles a relationship.

Most of my time is online .
You begin to forget what a fulfilling conversation actually feels like, when you feel alive , 

There's something about mental health , and unrecognised depression your always trying to avoid people and conversation .

Youl never get out of this cycle by pushing people away or avoiding them. Because you only stunt your own self and personality . Before you know it you forget what anything meaningful actually feels like because you are completely out of tune .

Wether you realise it or not or are on autopilot there is always a dark cloud over head , and it just continues to distort perception. 

I've realised that when I can come out of it which is very rarely I start seeing people differently . There personality is more vibrant .

Having a dark cloud always hanging overhead you don't really see people and you pretty much live like a ghost .

How the fuck do you correct this damage to your brain

It's like there has been so much dysfunction ontop of dysfunction ontop of dysfunction I have no clear understanding anymore what caused what , and how my functioning has and is deviated from a happy alive person , all there is is brain fog",18Apr2020,1
61,"I have gone to several doctors to try and figure out what is wrong/going on in my head. I started by going to a psychologist and after 2 sections he told me to talk to my family doctor about ADHD. So I got to my doctor and she said it may be depression but could be ADHD. Recommended I get another opinion. She said that she could give me a prescription for depression and/or ADHD but I told her no because I didn't want to dilute the pool. So she sends me to the hospital for a 3rd opinion. The guy at the hospital told me to go to counseling for anger issues. Now I have a appointment on Tuesday for counseling. I have looked into depression, anxiety and not likely but could still be bipolar (as several family members have it).

My problems have been restlessness, excessive fidgeting, always on the edge of emotions (mostly anger/frustration), constantly being bored, lack of energy, sort attention span, emotional highs and lows but mostly lows, always stressed.

It has caused problems in the relationship with my GF. She blames herself for the stress I have and it could possibly be but I always tell her it's not her at all.

I am looking forward to figuring all this out but it's still going to be a while I feel.",18Apr2020,1

Generally, I take them everyday for two month then suddenly stop them and let the situation become worse until I just can take it anymore and begin to take them again.

I don't know what do do with myself anymore and I have a bad feeling that if I don't do something things aren't gonna go well for me very soon.

66,"kinda weird, but the first time i went to a therapist, i believe i was 8, and she was also my brother's therapist, but for some reason neither of us liked her at all.

the second therapist i had was the school counselor who told my parents everything, even if i said specifically not to tell them.

the third therapist was fine at first, but as i got more comfortable around her she started saying that the panic attacks i was constantly having weren't really anxiety and that i was faking it? she also wouldn't let me have a session without my parents at a certain point, even though i thoroughly stated it made me uncomfortable, and would try to explain to my mom about how i was feeling and what my thoughts were, even though they weren't my thoughts/ feelings, and when i tried to say that, she started saying how it was making my mom upset? 

the fourth therapist i had was from my old school. she didnt work for the school, she was just the only person in the area who would drive there. i hated her ever since she started being my therapist because she had an annoying voice and would treat me like i was a baby, and then keep giving me the same advice for everything, every single time, even after i tried to tell her i tried it and it didn't work. and she would push me to talk about things i didn't want to, to the point where i would have panic attacks.

the fifth therapist i've had is the one i have currently, and is like a school counselor. i'm fine talking to her, but whenever i do i kind of shut off my emotions, and one time my braces broke, and instead of listening to me when i was just trying to say ""hey my braces broke"" and not asking for help. she then proceeded to tell me it would hurt my teeth (it didn't, i could've been able to fix it on my own) and that i needed to go to the school nurses. she was talking over me the entire time as i was trying to explain that i had it under control, and it had happened before, so i shut down. and instead of trying to help or care about what was going on, she said i was wasting her time, and she had better things to do than deal with me. she then forced me to go to the nurse, which made me miss class the next day and got me behind on work.

i don't know why this keeps happening, and my parents keep saying its because i don't like when people know too much about me or that i just have a negative view that affects my experience. 

i guess what i'm trying to ask is how can i find a good therapist?",18Apr2020,1

I’m cautiously optimistic because she is having me work up to a full dosage over the course of two months, but I really hope that this does more for me. I’m ready after 4 different med attempts to find something that works for me. And if it fails, then I know that something else might be it.

70,"I've been struggling with depression my entire adult life. Lately my boss has been miserable, and has been taking it out on me in passive aggressive ways, tearing me down for the slightest mistakes, purposefully saying things ""under breath"" loud enough for me to hear, then pretending it wasn't bait. This has been grinding away at me and making me bitter. I get depressive episodes more often than ever lately, and I've been having half-assed suicidal thoughts (note: No, I'm not going to commit suicide).

Today, during one of these episodes, I had a common nihilistic thought that NORMALLY makes me even sadder. 

""None of this bullshit matters anyway, in 100 years literally no-one will remember either my boss or me, and no one will ever look back at what a painfully average person I am, and even those who do after my death won't matter because I won't exist to experience their judgement."" 

But this time, instead of sadness, this unnatural feeling of joy and catharsis filled me, coupled with a temporary lack of care for literally anyone else around me. It's like I became a pure nihilistic sociopath for a short time, and what scares me is that it felt like the 'rightest' thing I'd felt in a long time. I knew it was wrong fundamentally, but my body kept sending chemicals into my brain telling me it was right. When I said ""this is wrong"" I was struggling not to smile and it was just empty words. Suddenly all of the employees and my boss were just annoying noises and colors, which is very fucked up because I've known my boss for many years and am extremely close with them. I continued my job like normal, wondering if this would pass, and not wanting to make a mistake that would cost me once my inhibitions came back.

The feeling passed, but it was like I was high or something, I've never felt that way before, and in retrospect it scares me. What happened to induce this weird nihilistic catharsis?",18Apr2020,1

at the same time, i can't sleep properly. caffeine / chocolate cravings are up a stupid amount. sex drive is up by a stupid amount. usually am a lot more extroverted, don't feel like seeing people irl much at all. i'm not depressed. yo, like, i just feel stupid, i can't seem to cry, but i feel guilty for not crying because of recent events going on. lmao none of this is logical.",18Apr2020,1

I hate this so much, none of my close friends talk to me, one of them promised they'll call me at least once each week and they haven't even texted me, another one lied to me to avoid me for a week and I found out in the stupidest way possible.

I hate my body and myself so much I can't do this anymore, I didn't want to be part of any of this. I hate how no one will ever care about me the same way I care about them, not even myself. I hate how I know nothing will become of me and my entire life will be horrible but I have to be positive so that I don't drag my friends with me into this. I hate that I can't be a ""normal"" person with normal ups and downs, it's just down down down down

I've been volunteering to help around but I hate that too, I hate it because I don't feel any happiness when helping people even though everyone tells me what a good job I'm doing. I don't want to do it anymore, but at the same time there's not enough volunteers and I can't make myself leave those people because I've seen the situations they're in.

I cried for almost an hour and usually when i cry i feel better afterwards but i still feel sad...i also feel so pathetic for crying and feel like i should be stronger :/ but i also feel relieved for finally feeling something since this whole day ive been just feeling soo numb and even thought about cutting myself again but i stopped myself.,18Apr2020,1
78,"My intrusive thoughts and ruminations have made me feel so caught up in my head and such and it just seems like since I started experiencing this anxiety is December that I'm not as interested or going out of way to talk to females right now because I'm so fixated on trying to feel back to myself and normal! Is this common? Does it get better? I'm a 20-year-old male who always enjoyed flirting and chasing women, I've started taking Fluvoxamine 200mg recently and didn't know if maybe that's a cause or not, it also seems like since this anxiety started I'm not as in the mood for watching porn or getting off like I used to be, I'm a 20 year old college male, but I just seem like I'm way to fixated on trying to get over this anxiety and feeling and thinking like my old self!

79,"I've been having infrequent, random ""visits"" from a singular voice lately.  This voice comes at times when I'm most vulnerable, and immediately starts communicate very directly.  He always commands me to harm myself, and whenever I don't comply he screams, and it's one of the most chilling sounds I've ever heard.  During these episodes, I feel very frightened and almost lose control of my body, slipping away into a trance or pulling my hair and acting in sheer panic.  While I can definitely make out the tone of voice of this apparition in my mind, this hallucination doesn't manifest in a traditional sense.  I don't perceive his words like I would any other sound, but I still hear his voice and the sentences he's conveying to me.

I don't know exactly what this could mean, but I am very worried.  I am refraining from self diagnosing, but I still want some background as to what these experiences could mean, and if they're indicative of a disorder.  I do have a history of mental illness in my family, as my grandpa was bipolar.  I'm unsure whether this is psychosis or not, because I'm not experiencing multiple voices all at once, just one.  It's been the same person the last two times. Also, I'm not undergoing any delusions.  What could this possibly mean, and should I seek help?",18Apr2020,1
80,"Before COVID-9 hit hard near me, I was feeling great. I wasn’t calling off of work, I wasn’t cancelling social obligations, I was trying to get in shape, and I was keeping the house and myself clean.
Now my anxiety is so bad I’m making myself physically ill. I have generalized anxiety disorder which is a bitch and a half on a normal day. My normal coping mechanisms aren’t working because I can’t pass my thoughts off as irrational anymore. There’s real fucking danger. My anxiety kicks up my depression, so now I feel fucked.

81,"So I don't know what I'm really going for here, as I know that you are all strangers on the internet. But here I go.

I guess to start, I'll say that I've been dealing with what I believe to be severe anxiety since I was about 13 years old. I have never once been to a medical professional regarding my mental health and I don't see that as an option for the foreseeable future, and that alone scares me. Having not done that, I have always had a hard time describing how I feel in regards to my mental health issues. Recently I've realized that the way my brain operates is what I would describe as extremely obsessive.

It takes hardly ANYTHING to set me off and to more or less ruin my entire day. Whenever I am alone (I live with my S/O and we have both been out of work for about a month) I pace, nonstop and repeat things in my head or out loud over and over, as if I'm trying to come to a conclusion about these thoughts but I never come to a real conclusion. These thoughts are almost always completely trivial, or at least blown completely out of proportion within my head. They generally relate to something I have said or done at some point in the day, something I have to do, something I want to do, something I feel I've done wrong or fucked up, and the like. If my S/O is around me, I often get overwhelmed by my thoughts and have to retreat to the bathroom to repeat things and pace. There's never any sort of resolve. This has been something I've done for as long as I can remember. 

Once again I don't quite know what i am trying to do here other than vent, or maybe just relate with some of you guys. I don't know what's wrong with me, I don't know if seeking help is worth it or not, I feel as if nothing can help me. This is all extremely unbearable.",18Apr2020,1

83,"I'm (22F) was about to graduate this May 2020, this being last year of my graduation degree and given the quarantine I'm going through and figuring out a lot of shit, I've been trying to ignore and subside for my mental health sake. 
It all started with second semester into college, I was shamed for leaving my long term high school boyfriend whom i dated for around 2 years. Soon after I got into a relationship with a guy (now 22M) let's call him X, for a short while, this guy didn't use to show up on dates, get handsy with his female friend and talk very low about me in front of others. I left him soon after I got know all these. 
The next semester (third semester) X spent all the time talking shit about me and saying that i cheated on him with my ex. Sad thing is a lot of my close female friends also participated. 
At the end of third semester, one of my classmate (now 23M) let's call him Z, showed up and use to care about me a lot. I had hit rock bottom with all that shit going on. My mental health was all time low, my mother didn't talk to me much and I was getting bad grades. Bad thing is nobody except this guy, actually listened to my side of story. 
Fourth semester of college, I was happy with Z, when shit started getting worse. He was being fed the old shit by X and his friends. Both X and Z, use to live in same hostel and were my college mate. Z defended me for a long time, while all the other people started treating us very bad. Other college mates, formed a block against both of us, talk shit to me publicly and the list is endless. 
Meanwhile, I started getting to know Z better, we started dating, but after few months Z started getting violent. I tried managing this relationship, but it ended up getting more abusive (mentally, verbally and physically). He use to call me slut and how I suck around every guys dick. This went up till a point, where he stealth while having sex and denied cumming inside me. He said he'll rape one of female friends, while we were discussing something she had done wrong with me. He would try every way to control me and get me back into the relationship, but I felt so horribly violated I never went back. 
Z would tell people that I left him alone and use to hold my hand in public forcefully. While all the other people around us kept quite. And later started asking me, ""Why have I left Z?"" 
So last two semester of college (this is tenth semester) , I've been out pursuing my internship in another city, away from such toxic environment. Meanwhile Z, has gotten scholarship for pursuing PhD degree, has done very well in studies and topped the last (ninth) semester. So, all the teachers are all praise for him. As I have been out of that place, I have started healing very well and fast. Got many supportive people around. Still struggling to get back into studying, but I have secured a good position in an research institute to continue my higher studies. 
So,  last four years of constant mental harassment in an relationship by such people, by college mate and also by teachers because of bad grades has reduced me into a pea. I have a very fragile self esteem and confidence in myself. But I'm still working hard to get into Grad school. I'm having a very bad time dealing with so much of mental harassment alone, I have no way let such things out. Let alone ask for help. I just want to break free of this loop and live my life to the fullest and pursue my dream career of scientific research. I have consulted psychologist and resorted to medication also, but that didn't really help much. I use to feel distant while telling all this to my therapist and would end up feeling kicked at the end of the session. It didn't help.",18Apr2020,1

I really don't want to ask for help irl as i did a while ago but it  only lead to more problems but  I'm also not sure if i should just leave it. Also I don't feel sad nor happy more just neutral but a lot of the time it switches to weird feelings. I also have very strong urges to cut myself and just thinking about it makes me feel tingly and numb on parts of my body, I can't seem to control those feelings.

When I'm with my friends or doing something fun I'm fine, but at night trying to sleep or cycling etc. It's always there.

87,"So I’ve been in my current relationship close to 5 years now. I love him so much, he treats me like an absolute princess and has always supported me, no matter what. Through mental health issues, suicidal ideation, and everything in between, he always tries to make me feel beautiful, smart and special. 

Problem is I pick myself apart constantly, I’m almost 25, and over the years my confidence seems to be slipping more and more. It’s at the point where I can’t stand to have my photo taken, I hate my body no matter what, I think I’m stupid and all my ambitions and goals I once had feel like an impossibility; now that I have no self-confidence. I don’t believe anything I do is good, no matter what anyone says I just don’t think I’m good enough, or talented, and feel like I have to embrace a life of mediocrity - which is saddening. 

Now, I went to drama school to get a qualification so this hasn’t always been the case for me. I obviously never used to have any of these fears, and I truly believed I could achieve anything I put my mind to. I literally dropped out of high school because I was that confident my audition would get me accepted, before I even heard back! I’ve recently come to the realization that every time I get in a long term relationship my self-esteem and confidence starts to dip into oblivion. It happened in my first long term relo, that lasted 3 1/2 years, and he also was very kind to me, never insulted me or anything like that, but it wasn’t until I was single again that I regained my confidence. 

This is the only common denominator I can see, but I can’t understand how being in a relationship, with someone so great, can be such a self-esteem killer?! I don’t want to have to be single to be confident. 

Has anyone else found this? What did you do to Combat it? I seriously can’t live my life with no confidence, it’s horrible for my mental health and it really stops me living my best life. :(",18Apr2020,1

89,"I see a lot of posts where people have been asked to utilise this period well, given tips on how to build some skills, muscle, planning your life and a lot of other things that basically include a lot of discipline. 
Now, utilising your time during the lockdown or in general, is obviously a good thing to do.

However, a lot of you feel pressurised to do something worthwhile and if you fail at it, you end up feeling lost and depressed because you're not part of a rat race which you did not sign up for.

Taking a break is one of the most underrated skill in the world. Know that it's completely okay to do nothing for a while. Your mind and body needs some rest. Am I asking you to be complacent? No, never. But it's genuinely okay you aren't getting those abs or if you haven't set your life plans after the lockdown.

You don't have to compare your journey with anybody else. Your life is just gonna be a series of experiences, it's not a race. Everyone has a different story to tell.

Do not freak out if you're unable to do anything productive right now. You're only human.
While you're at it, there is absolutely no need to hold anything against the ones who are using this time to do the things they love.

Remember you can absolutely do nothing and still stay happy, it's all about acceptance and not worrying. 
Don't fall into the loop of feeling guilty. Rather just embrace your existence and move along your life at your own pace. 

TL;DR : Do whatever you wish to do. Do not judge anybody for what they do. Keep a check on your mental health.

Ever since this happened. I’ve been more stressed, constantly thinking about the future, worried about my friends and family, wishing there was something to do...

Wait. 
Thinking about the future? Worried about people other than my self? A desire to take action?

These are things I’ve never really felt before. I have been suffering from anxiety and depression before the Coronavirus hit. I was having panic attacks at work and was suicidal. But these past few weeks I’ve been focusing less on me.

What really helped me clear my mind was focusing more on those who are perhaps experiencing anxiety and panic when they never really have, or depression from staying indoors and not seeing people for a long time. It kinda broke that cycle of repetitive negative thoughts and feeling sorry for myself. Not to say my problems are less important, but it’s nice to be that person who’s needed instead of being needy. It’s not like I’m cured, I’ve had good days and bad days. But I’ve been able to find peace more times these past few weeks than I ever had in months.

My old medications stopped working for me and it took me a year after that to get on medications that didn't have side effects that put me in the hospital.

I also had nothing going for me, I had to drop out of school and that impeded on my time to be able to visit (and eventually move in with) him. When he broke up with me he swore to me that it had nothing to do with my mental health issues, but that's all I can see it as. We had stopped talking less when my mental health got worse. It's as simple as that to me, except that the distance made things worse. The distance sucked before but did not make it impossible for us to talk to each other.  It's just really hard to have my depression ruin everything for me, I even lost the love of my life. We would've been together for four years next month.

93,"**TLDR**: My gf has something close to PTSD, I don't know what to do and I need help to help her.

**HER BACKGROUND/CONTEXT**

I have recently started dating this girl (well quarantine is a bit in the way) and I think that she has some kind of not very strong PTSD. I already knew that she had some kind mental illness due to something during her childhood before I started dating her and I want to help her. I'll be 17 in June and she is 17 (she is 1 grade up, last year high school here so she is pretty stressed out). She had what I believe was her traumatic event when she was 5 and, well, her cousin that was 13 or so sexually harassed her, for all I know it has only happened once. She has told me that her cousin kept giving her ""the looks"" until she entered adolescence (maybe it was the time around when her cousin started getting conscious of his actions). Her father wasn't very supportive either and she once feared him, she fears a lot of people that want to get close (specially new). I think that I  managed to surround that because I'm the ""brother"" (not literally, but we are pretty much siblings) of her best friend. Her parents divorced after having their second child (her little sister) when she was around 8, her sister birthed when my friend was 6 or so (there were already problems in within the couple and I think she blames herself of her parent's divorce). Now she gets along with her father pretty well and lives with her grandma, she told me that she doesn't live with her mum because of the fear of what once happened in that house (i have no idea what happened in that house). She has not yet been able to talk to me much about her father or what happened at what once was her home. I didn't dig this all up, I was there for her so that she could tell me anything and I listened (it's what I believe is best, so that she doesn't fell pressured to tell you, she tells you because she wants it and needs it in some shape or another). Her ex doesn't leave her alone with a lot of Instagram accounts. She gets some flashbacks and as we mainly text i don't know what to do, but she seems to be aware of that and gets out of it  on her own (I feel proud of her because she is strong enough to get her out of it, I don't know why I feel proud of her, maybe I just feel happy). She has asked me why someone like me would get close to her if didn't want to harm her, why someone would love her. I do. I think that she has managed to put on a character to stop herself from thinking about that (in the good way, she loves dancing and she mainly puts that on when she is dancing or in a situation close to dancing \[modern dance\]) She is seeing a psychologist and I know that she has either diagnosed something or is suspicious.

**MY BACKGROUND**

My parents also got divorced but wasn't nearly as traumatic and I also had some incest (a couple of french kisses are the only things that I remember) with my cousin when I was 5 i think and she is 6 years older than me. I have no sequels that I can see from that. It is true that I may think that I may have lacked some love, not because I didn't have it but because I didn't want it. Now I have all the love I need, I express it, I give it and I am grateful to her because of that. I will probably see a psychologist in the future. (my mum recommended it to me also)

**WHAT I NEED HELP WITH**

* I need to know if I'm close enough thinking that she has some form of PTSD. For the information that I have searched she's got pretty much all the PTSD symptoms \[a traumatic event, she tends to avoid some things \[new people in particular\], the ""why would people love me?"", low self esteem\].
* I need to find reliable sources of information about PTSD and other mental illnesses. Mainly big sites where I can keep educating myself.
* I need to know how to act, even though she seems to be able to take care of herself. The more supportive I can be the better. I've not been able to find much about that.
* I need to know if what I'm doing is good enough or even positive. (I think I'm helping her)
* I would love to find a sub where people that know someone that has some kind of mental illness and actively tries to help them shares their stories and most importantly , or make it myself. I think that it would be very helpful to people like me because we eat a lot of shit (like you &lt;3) and we don't know what to do \[maybe I am the helper or something like that\]. I would still keep following that because I think it would help a lot of people (the helpers and the helped).

95,"Hi .. when I was young I was beaten up by my parents from an early stage for a long period of time.. I found it hard to socialise with people around me..and never had friends. Have been in several relationships which ended up badly because could never find a girl who'd commit &amp; help..

I was also went to a therapist whilst at school..but did not find that very helpful 

Fast-forward several years, I ended up at university in a different country..I came here for love, together with a girl who seemed to be committed and wanting to help but due to my mental problems I have started over-thinking all sorts of weird scenarios and we had an argument over the phone.. ended up in a foreign country (UK) where I barely knew the language, alone ... and fall into a deep depression which I never came out from..

&amp;#x200B;

A year and half later I met this girl who was perfect.. smart, also came from a different country so understood my struggles, we got along well for some times until my mental issues, anxiety &amp; bipolarism.. mood swings came up again..  However, what I felt for this girl and the way she made me feel helped me fight this although it has been mentally draining .. did not want to eat.. I was feeling weak because of this fight I had everyday to try to hide this from her.. We ended up being together until yesterday.. 5 years and 17 days.. as we got through the relationship it got harder for me to fight this so I started over-reacting, over-thinking.. always been in a bad emotional state.. but couldn't ever open about to her about my problems, in fact I was blaming her..

After many fights and arguments she had enough of my bullshit(I don't blame her.. I made her life so difficult) .. but now after she left me it is not worth living for..anything This girl was perfect, out of everyone I met she was the only one who managed to make me want to fight this.. but the burden of not opening up to her about it led to a lot of fights...mean arguments..

I am now worse than any point before.. I even had thoughts of suicide ..but still find it hard to open about my mental health..which I believe started when I was very young..I don't want to lose her but she is now more serious than ever before..I don't want to live anymore I stopped eating and drinking water for past 24h and I am in a terrible mood..",18Apr2020,1

107,"Hey there, first of all, sorry if my english isn't that good, it's not my first language.
So, I have a problem I think. Ever since I graduated from I guess the equivalent to highschool last year I did close to nothing. I did try out going to university and dokng an internship at a kindergarten and I've been kind of trying to find something.
I say kind of because I don't do it as actively as i would like to, because I don't have the motivation.
Now I am not someone who likes to talk about my problems and I get really anxious and cannot really talk when I get confronted with my problems, basically I freeze up like a scared animal.
That has led to a rather bad situation in where my parents think I don't trust them and stuff on multiple occasions and the other day, when I tried to talk to my mother, and asked why she didn't involve herself with my problems as much as she used to, she said she can't handle it and doesn't want me to see her crying again. Basically she said she can't handle my Problems either, deal with it yourself. Noe this wouldnt be too bad if there wasnt quarantine and everything, because I was supposed to already get therapy right now.
But now I am stuck at home with a father that doesnt understand why I dont do anything and shouts because of that and a mother who cant handle the situation and acts like nothing is wrong and I am angry because of that and would like to know wheather I should tell her that I want her to help me even if she has to cry, or wheather I should accept it and wait for professional help.

Tldr: My mom can't confront me and acts like everything is fine because she cannot handle the situation (my anxiety) and needs to cry and I want to talk to her but do not know if I should respect her wish not to talk or should be selfish because I need her and am angry at her for not wanting to cry in front of me

113,"The end of last year, December, I reconnected with the girl I had loved for the past 4 years. She finally decided to notice me during this time and led me in a relationship in which I did everything I could to make this one sided relationship maybe work for us, as I struggled to find any way to make us work out together, for the only person that could brighten my days. As she was extremely emotionally neglectful and attempted to disregard the relationship multiple times, I later learned she never loved me and was in a different relationship with the person she loved. Naturally, I was destroyed.

Fast forward a month or two, my sister had been living with myself and my parents for the past year or so, and had demonstrated the attitude and selfishness of a badly behaved elementary school student, hurting my parents as well as myself to extreme emotional levels (me and all my siblings were homeschooled for a large part of our lives, extremely close as a result). We continued to love and support her in positive things and tried to help her. Throughout this time she started seeing a man again that both she herself admitted to disliking, and admitted he really was quite a horrible person. After a long period of hope that she would recover, and pain seeing her dive down, she made her decision to leave our entire family permanently and run away with him, never to talk to us again.

Before my sister I had been able to grieve, to process the pain I felt from my first love, but after she left and I first heard of it, I broke down in a way I never have before. After (regrettably) losing my mind and wailing in pain heh, I haven’t been able to feel much of anything. My body feels like it is rejecting all positive emotion and I get outbursts where the pain leaks and I panic and can’t control my breathing. Other times I sit and struggle to think of anything but disappearing forever. I have tried on a few occasions to put myself into a coma, and failed, clearly. But I don’t know how to go on like this. Even my thoughts and judgement on matters is extremely impaired, I’ve struggled to comprehend complex emotions and scenarios, and I lack much of the will to do many things I used to be so driven to do.

I don’t even understand what to ask for at this point anymore. I know I should look to the light and know it’s not forever, but every day it’s getting harder to find that light. If you guys have any advice, please help me.",18Apr2020,1

Last night, I had a dream that I got pregnant in high school (I’ve graduated), and that I almost had an abortion but I decided to put my baby up for adoption and then I couldn’t stop crying because I missed him. And then I got pregnant again and I almost gave the second baby up as well, but the doctor told me that the baby had a broken leg and that she was suicidal (I know, that’s VERY weird) and that it would be better for me to have an abortion, so I did. And for some reason afterwards, I was still grieving over the baby I gave up but I knew it was for the best.

For context I recently purchased my first firearm this week, nothing special just a double barrel 12 gauge. I thought it was kind of cool and I was pretty excited about it. I took it home, assembled it and wanted to show my parents this cool new thing I bought. 



This is the part in the show where my mother has a break down.


I brought it over in a carrying case and when I opened it up to show them, my mom had an expression as if I had laughed and put the barrel in my mouth, which of course I did not do.


My father thought it was kind of cool since he has a few guns in the safe. However, now my mother is calling and texting much more frequently than is normal and if I don't respond almost IMMEDIATELY she starts to get concerned to a point she starts hyperventilating. I missed a phone call because I was taking a nap and she drove over to my house, let herself in unannounced, was panting sweating, shaking and looked as if she had been crying. 


To her credit, shes my biological mother so that does warrant A LITTLE bit of concern if I wasnt answering my phone. HOWEVER, she has been calling me three times a day and texts me every couple of hours asking how I am or what I'm doing, not too actually talk to me but literally just to make sure I respond.


I have had bouts with depression in the past but I can confidently say that thankfully I am no where near suicidal. I honestly just wanted this shotgun because I think it's cool. Neither my sister, father, nor myself can get her to calm down at all.



TL;DR - my mom calls me, or just appears at my house, three times a day because I bought a shotgun and shes scared beyond reason that I'll turn it on myself. I won't.",18Apr2020,1

120,"I've been having issues with my mental health ever since I was 10, I'm 18 now and things have only been getting worse. The two biggest things that make everything harder are school and my household.

School stresses me out so much, it makes me physically ill, i have a lot of trouble starting/working/finishing things due to my lack of motivation and difficulty to concentrate on anything besides suicide.

This got me get stuck in this endless cycle of: having trouble doing work &gt; getting stressed &gt; getting sick &gt; missing school &gt; missing more work &gt; losing motivation &gt; ... and everything all over again.

My household and ""family"" are even worse, they are incredibly toxic, they see ""weakness"" as one of the worse possible thing and don't see mental illnesses as real. (I'm not going to get in to many details about them right here but i hope you get the point) Their lack of support and insults towards my ""weaknesses"" have been pushing my limits for a while now.

I've always thought i had to do everything thing at once, move out, get a job, study and get better, but I've realise that that's going to be really hard, probably impossible for me
So here is what i hope i can do:

1. Finish school.

2. Get help from social aid (don't know if that's the right term in English) to get out of this house as fast as possible, hopefully they'll understand my situation and provide me with a place to stay and food as I'm probably unable to hold a job for over a week. Any tips would be really nice. (I live in Belgium, social aid and similar things are pretty big and usually pretty helpfull here)

3. Finally be able to get the medical attention that I've needed for years like therapy, a diagnosis, meds maybe and even for physical issues like new glasses, getting my teeth fixed, getting my legs issues fixed. (universal healthcare)

4. When i managed to cope with my issues, I'll get a job (part time if i can) provide for myself and start learning about what i really want to (maybe university)

5. Become independent (the dream) but if i can't hopefully I'll be fine with my job and do freelance on the side or get a job in that field.

6. Be okay with life.

Oh god this i long, i don't even really know why I'm posting this, probably just for myself. I'm a little fearful at the possibility that i have bipolar personality disorder and that these 'ideas' are just some mild mania delusions or maybe that's what my depressive thoughts are trying to make me think, either way I'm probably overthinking here. I'm lucky to be born in my country, there's a lot of help at my disposition and unlike my parents taught me, i shouldn't be afraid/ashamed to ask for it.

He told me that i need to find a job for the summer, the problem is that I want to find an internship in my field. However, it’s been really hard to do so because of the coronavirus. Last place I want to work is in retail or fast food because I had nothing but bad experiences working there and i really want to advance myself. I don’t want to be that person going for a degree in cyber security and have a min wage job at a retail store, I feel to ashamed doing so.

I’ve tried so hard to find an internship but no luck so far. That’s to be expected since internships are hard to find and jobs in cyber security are hard to find in an entry level. I had a mental breakdown because of the argument that happened between me and my dad over the subject matter. I’ve been having mental breakdowns at least once a week because of my stress levels.

My mental breakdown was so bad. I screamed erratically, I began hitting things, I began kicking. You may ask why I did this, and this is why:

Im so sick of the pressure of having to be perfect. To be the best student, do get an internship, To have a perfect body. I can’t handle all this pressure. I have so many built up emotions, and it’s gotten worse since I’ve had to stay inside. All those emotions just came out all at once. I hate myself for everything. I can’t see any reason to be happy again. I got off my meds because they weren’t doing it for me anymore. I feel like i don’t belong in my major despite me being very passionate about it and getting A’s and B’s in my classes.

It’s now something I feel like I’ve latched onto to feel worse because it’s making me think about my body more than ever and instead of just having a lazy day and feeling ok, I feel like a failure and pathetic for not going out. 

The clear solution seems to be that I should just stop, but I felt so happy and positive about getting good at something and being healthier because i was ashamed I didn’t exercise, but my brain just won’t let me. I really cannot stress I have tried so hard to remain positive and resilient, but as I said I just embarrass myself in public when I’ve tried to push myself.",18Apr2020,2
141,"I can’t do anything I want to cause my parents are stopping me. I want to start going to the gym but my dad just says that it’s not good for your mind, and something about how everybody who goes to the gym are weight and body obsessed. I can’t workout at home since we don’t have any tools to use and I lack the motivation to workout at home.

I haven’t exercised in a year.

I hate where I live. It’s always so cold and dark, and it’s making my mood so much worse. I want to leave my country so I can move to some place warmer, maybe the southern parts of America or southern Italy/Spain. I would do that if I was able to, but again, my parents are stopping me.

142,"Since December, I started feeling depressed. I come from a very conservative family and they don't believe in therapy at all, so that sucks. I used to be a straight A student but I started sleeping in class, I stopped paying attention, I barely studied, and my grades are slipping. The past few weeks I didn't do shit for school and I have exams in a month and 2 weeks, and I don't study for anything. remember those are 10 exams and I already don't understand anything. 

I feel so useless and stupid. Because I'm a straight a student (or I used to be) people have really high expectations of me. I'm gonna let everyone down and I just wanna die. 


The worst part is I can't even bring myself up to study. I can't concentrate and I have ZERO motivation. Not even one bit. I just lay in my bed all day.",18Apr2020,2

I am writing this paper for one of my classes where I am effectively arguing that Reddit is easier on mental health than other social media platforms given there are no faces/profile pictures, no emphasis on looking skinny and having nice clothes and being an influencer in that way like Instagram/Twitter... instead it is more about the content one produces.

149,"I’ve been through several therapists personally over the last 15 years. I could tell a couple of them weren’t right from the beginning. I didn’t feel like they truly understood what I was saying. They listened well enough, and nodded along, but I knew they weren’t getting it. There were two over the years that I met with for about 4 months each. They were both so nice, so warm. But, that was about it - they were friendly, but we weren’t getting anywhere. Therapy takes time, sure, but after 4 months I was leaving sessions feeling not even the slightest bit of...”hey! We made progress today!” 

Last year, I decided to try phone sessions with a therapist in another state. In all honesty, she’s technically a “coach”. She came highly regarded and recommended to me on Reddit, actually! After one phone session - just one - I hung up and bawled my eyes out like a baby. Like...embarrassing heaving sobs. In just 50 minutes, she GOT me. She GOT IT. She listened, and responded, and responded well. One time we had a conversation that was particularly draining. So much so that it kind of made me feel down all week, just because it was heavy and had been weighing on me and now it was at the surface. This happens in intense therapy but I still just had a blah week. The following week when I called for our session, the first words out of her mouth were “so how was your week? We left off on some heaviness and I was thinking about you and imagining it probably sat with you for a while.” She already knew how it affected me. That’s a good therapist. They’re not all good. If you’re paying for someone to help you, make it worth it. Keep looking until someone feels right. If after a few months you’re still not feeling progress, thank them and move on. There are several kinds of therapists, too. There are psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, coaches. Don’t limit your search. Please don’t give up on yourself. You’re not “unhealable”. You’re not destined to suffer. You’re just not matched right yet. 

Like my title says, there will always be those who graduated at the bottom of their class. Someone has to, right? Just like any other profession - they have the certificates and diplomas on their walls but real life execution of their job? They might not be so good at it. Please keep searching until someone gets you and gives you hope. 

Good luck on your journeys. ❤️",18Apr2020,3
150,"I started remembering my life while i was watching a Reddit Reading video, and there was a post about a woman who'd got a tank of fake LED jellyfish in order to help her anxiety and her Boyfriend had got mad because he felt her Girlfriend had been scammed because she purchased a piece of junk.

I understand his point, but he clearly didn't understand what anxiety is what so ever.  
Tank Of Jellyfish is pretty bullshit in my opinion.   
BUT Thats how you cure anxiety, If you can trick yourself into feeling comfortable, your body will soon learn to be comfortable everywhere and forget about anxiety.   


My Life's never been so bad. I've never been Abused By Family, Kidnapped or Raped anything awful or traumatic like that. But I just think I've not been very strong minded, and Its ruined me. 

I myself Have had anxiety for pretty much my whole life, even as a little kid i'd always be scared and nervous going places and usually resulted in me soiling my pants because I'd be stressed and unable to reach a bathroom, The problem is like IBS, It comes on suddenly while I'm anxious or stressed and If i can't get to a bathroom it causes me emence psysical pain, This goes all the way back to when i was a toddler at a nursery school, I asked the workers / carers if i could use the bathroom and they said no, I was very little and the Nursery lasted afew hours, Kids aren't good with their bathroom stuff the best of times, I'd begged the woman to let me go to the bathroom and i said 'But theres one over there' And she said 'No No That Bathroom Is For Adults Only' this resulted in my pooping my pants and having to wait an hour or so for my Mum to come pick me up, Because we didn't have mobile phones back then our family was too poor to afford them, Once my Mum come to pick me up the workers lectured my Mum about how I'd poo'd myself and how it 'Really Smelled' I feel this may be whats sort of left mental scaring, Because even to this day, If I'm outside / not in my house and need the bathroom I get intense stomach pains and instant panicking to use the bathroom,  I'm 20 currently so as you'd think this is extremely embarassing and prevents me from living normally, I spend most of my time in the house, only going out on rare days to see my dad at lunch times while he's at work, My Mum since quit her job out of misery and to help me. These 'Toilet Buisiness' Which is what i used to call it as a child over the years has caused alot of stress for my parents and myself, When i was little my Mum used to think i was acting up or being naughty for attension she had no idea I had mental problems, I used to pee the bed until i was around 12 - 13 years old too... I've got no idea why, What caused it, If i just slept too heavily or have never had a sound night of sleep and things were just wrong, I used to have to wear teenager nappies and I'd pee so much they'd leak through and go all over my Pajamas and all over my sheets, duvet, and matteress, My matteress used to stink and have huge yellow brown pee marks all over it... So we had to get rid of it and get a rubber topped matteress, And it was the most horrible uncomfortable matteress I'd ever slept on in my life. Sleeping on the floor was more comfortable than that matteress. I spent a good few months or so sleeping on the floor before my parents found out. And luckily by then the Night Wetting had completely stopped by that point, So we got rid of the.. Pee Rubber Matteress and got a Super Comfy Amazing Memory Foam Matteress for my bed. It was luxury. I think i was in high school by the time i stopped. I'd never been ultra adept in school, It was so hard to focus because i was so so tired all the time. I got ilnesses so easily and spent so much time out of school because i had all kinds of sicknesses. Nothing Major just blocked Sinuses, Awful Coughs, Sore Throat, Vomiting, Diarrhea. So so often. Stomach Bugs and such from School. In Primary School (Marlbrough) I'd often need to use the bathroom during class because of stress, It was once so bad my arsehole bled from using horrible sand paper toilet paper that I cried and having people laughing at me while using the bathroom. Awful awful memories stick like this in my head forever, The bad memories overweigh any good ones. Not forgetting the fact I'd always be bullied in every school I'd ever been in. There'd always be some little fucker who'd take great pleasure out of making me feel miserable or hurting me. I once (Knypersley) got pushed along the floor that it sliced my forehead open bad.. And the wound when it dried... Was like a Piece of peperoni on my head. Jack Wetherall that name will always stick with me the rest of my life. I'd move school to avoid this shit, and Followed me to that school. He moved school aswell. I couldn't beleive it. By then my family was moving to a new town, I think it was about 2007 so luckily I'd got away from this kid, ( Marlborough) Wasn't so bad. I'd still had to use the bathroom, have night wetting, be bullied, I'd often cry under the table because I didn't understand things in lessons.. People would laugh at me. But It wasn't completely unbarable. I did have some nice times and I also had a teacher i feel might have understand me he was always my favorite teacher Mr Rob Dyson.   


A little side note all my talking is all sort of muddled up, Everything isn't in order its rather random as it comes to me... and I remember..  


I'd gone to this useless company called 'CAMHS' Countless times during that period and I didn't know what to do. I'd always had trouble learning in school, and I'd pee the bed bla bla bla.. But I'd go to CAMHS and they'd ask me what up.. And I didn't understand or know what to do.. I'd say 'I'm Alright' Bare in mind you'd have to wait Months and Months to get an appointment with CAMHS, and when i said 'I'm Alright' I was discharged the next day and said i was fine. I WAS NOT FUCKING FINE. I didn't know what to say or do.. I never understood what was wrong. School would often refer me back to CAMHS and every time I'd be Discharged. And I'd always just be extrmely nervous before going worrying about the toilet.  


But anyway I'd finished (Marlborough) and moved to (Tytherington) High School and the issues grew worse, I had to be given a toilet pass, a Piece of laminated paper which allowed me to use the bathroom, People think you'd use this card to abuse and go and smoke or some shit. But I'd truly use its true purpose because I'd need the bathroom because of anxiety. At this point of high school I had no idea I had any sort of Anxiety or anything. I'd just have to use the toilet so often. It was rediculous.  
There was hundreds if not thousands of incidents in Primary (Marlborough) and High (Tytherington) I could literally go on all DAY talking about the different awful things that happened.

I'd been refered to CAMHS in highschool too, The same shit over and over, They never suggested anything was wrong with me, I never understood what to say was wrong. Even while 13 in High School. By this point I'd started to get an inner rage hate for life and others. AND UNQUENCED ANGER but I't had never truly showed its self until in 2011 my family moved back to the Origional Town i went to Primary School before moving (Knypersley) But as the town was different they had a Primary, Middle and Secondary (High) Schools, Where as the  (Marlborough) town had Primary and Secondary (High) School. So going back to the (Knypersley) Town was almost like a weird step down, From being in High School, to a Middle School which was more like a Primary School. and was just rather odd.  
Middle School was (James Bateman) on the very first day of the new term, I flipped the fuck out, I was already given shit by some asshole named Jake Dodds, And before the term decided I wasn't going to take anymore shit off anyone. That was a Mistake. I'd been seen by Girls and Boys alike as the Mental Spacker Freak Out Kid, On my first day. I'd always been mad and angry from that day forward. I'd focus on being angry and hating the world than I did work. Like i said earlier. I'd never been good at anything. I'd never had skills or talents. I'd never been good at spelling or maths. Languages or science. I'd always been in the bottom lowest possible class. Where all the scum kids were who didn't give a shit abut learning was. So I never got a chance to concentrate on work. I'd always be so stressed and upset all the time. I'd did have odd occasional friends. but they always had extended friends who took a disliking to me. These friends would be really nice and cool 1 to 1 but if there was ever a group. I'd get bullied or forgotten.. I'd just walk around following a group. I'd be the kid who sits with everyones coats while the others play. I had an Xbox too in (Marlborough) And If there was a game like Call Of Duty MW2 or World At War / Halo Reach where it required 4 players to play something on a team, or zombies, or Story Mode. I'd be able to play, Until someone better came along and I'd be kicked from the game, kicked from the party and everyone would ignore me. This happened so often all the way through primary, high and what ever. I once instead of seeing my grandparents stayed to play Xbox with my 'FRIENDS' And they said they were playing that day, My Mum and Dad set off and I stayed behind. And all those bastards were suddenly busy. and couldn't play. It was too late to get my parents to come back.. Quite soon later my Grandfathther Terrance.. Who I loved dearly Died... He wasn't a great man he was rather old fashioned and mean to my Grandma and Auntie Pauline. But He was still my Grandad. I loved him... He'd let me ride on his Mobility scooter with him to the shops. and He'd always play His Electric Organ for me... Put his glasses on and turn the bright light on the keys.. and Play  I do like to be beside the seaside, and my Favorite Eine Kleine Nachtmusik he'd often miss keys like Les Dawson (Not On Purpose) But I still loved it anyway.. When he died I always wanted one of or all of his Smoking Pipes.. Not to smoke but to keep.. Grandad always Smoked a Pipe like Mr Bouncer from Beatrix Potter books. And I'd always remember that. But sadly Grandma threw them all out as if they were Garbage.. She didn't know I had an attachment to them... But I did and I'll never get to see or touch them... Luckily I did get his Brass Toilet Ashtray which always made me laugh as a Kid. But i lost the piece of brass that attaches the toilet seat to the base. But i had a Dalek Plunger from Character Building which fit in the gap perfectly. and Is there to this day.  


Anyway back to (James Bateman) basically I had to receive another 'Bathroom Card' from a Teacher Called Miss Higginbottom and Boy, Was she a Bitch. She gave me a Bathroom Card and I used it as normal. And one day my Anxiety was pretty bad. And basically had to use it every lesson. And it came to her lesson and i got a Pang of stress and had to use the bathroom. And I ask her if i can use the bathroom and she looks at me MAD 'ARE YOU GOING TO USE THAT CARD FOR EVERY LESSON TODAY' In front of the whole FUCKING CLASS, Everyone starting at me. and some laughing or smiling. So i ask her 'So can i please use the bathroom' she ignores me. I start panicking and say 'Can I please use' YES She blurts out with. And i get up and go. Stressing to the bathroom. Yeah thanks you bitch.  


Again I'd gone to CAMHS at least 3 times during my Stay at (James Bateman) With same results having appointments MONTHS to wait, and having them cancelled because theres 'Someone More Important' or 'A Patient has tried to kill themselves' Honnestly I'm not fucking supprised. If most had to wait that Long I'd fucking kill myself too. CAMHS is a fucking disgusting money starved Child / Adolessent Mental Health service in england, and its fucking shit. It could possibly be better if they had reasonable funding. BUT THEY DON'T What a suprised yay torie government every time they are up for election they fool the masses into thinking they'll improve the country. and anything thats gone wrong or is bad is blamed on the Labour Government from the 1970's 'labour had put the country into a bad positon' Oh yeah the same bad position its been in for all these years under torie rule ? Starved Mental Health. Starved NHS. Starved Councils. Where does all the Tax Money Go ? Why is the country Borrowing all the time. Most poor places got funding from the European union because our governement didn't give a shit. Where does all the money for taxes go Tories ? In your big fat greedy pockets ? I don't know. Because it sure doesn't get spent on Roads, Health Care, Public Support and Facilities. I'm sorry to have got political but what other reason is all the United Kingdoms services starved. Why does Scotland get Free Perscriptions but not England ? things like that.  


So (James Bateman) Went to Highschool (Biddulph) and James Batemen quite possibly was the worst years of my life, from the Arsehole Peers to the Arsehole Teachers Mr Sadler Fucking Bastard. More like Mr Saddo Creepy Lame Bastard. At least I wasn't pissing myself at night.  


Biddulph High wasn't much better it was the same people as bateman apart from new teachers, and more punishement. I'd often be sent out of lessons, I didn't have as toilet pass for this school, But i can assure you. It was as bad and I received detensions for needing the bathroom because of anxiety. 'If you walk out of this lesson to go to the bathroom you'll have to go to detention. And guess what I went to after school or lunchtime detentions often. I never did my homework, School was the most miserable thing in my life, I never had energy ever because it took me up completly. and I never even did that well in any subject. So the last thing i wanted to do when i got home was more of the shit work that got me nowhere. So i just  played video games or watched tv with my family. I'd be constantly punished for this, Infact I prefered after school punishments so i didn't have to walk home surrounded by loud assholes, I also walked out of Detentions in the past to go home and that resulted in Isolations, I had many many Isolations which was me alone or maybe 2 others in a room all day doing work from teacher that we were doing that day in normal class, being supervised by some teaching assistant. I mostly just played games on my Phone or DS pretending to work and ocasionally scribble some shit on the paper.   


Its not that I didn't want to learn or work  but normal classes were unbarably loud in the scum class with the most disgusting troll you'd ever see in your life ever Courtney Mason most obnoxious gobshite person in the world. She always gave me crap in (James Bateman) Too and i was stuck with her for the first year of Biddulph High, Don't get me wrong I don't think I can do amazing at work. But I'm deffinetly not Thick As Shit. I can understand 'things' and am Polite when needed. But fuck she made lessons unbarable. Now Biddulph High had a Camhs (I think) Rep come to school and talk to the troubled or troublesome kids. I was both.  


Cathy Cooper. Now she was an extremely nice person to talk to she seemed to genuinely give a shit and wanted me to to well.. Which was weird because no one ever really give a shit and saw me as trouble. I started seeing Cathy after an outburst in form room where someone was pissing me off and giving me shit silently while the form tutor Miss Tracey Condliffe was reading the register and notices. I never liked her, The 'boys' always thought she was attractive, But i always saw her as some Dance Class Millenial bitch who wasn't remotely attractive in the slightest. But I got mad burst out with swearing and shouting and told him to fucking tell me if he had a problem. To which he started shrugging and the Condliffe says 'Wes your scaring us' So i just got my bag said fuck you then and went home, And so it bagan.  If i ever got any shit of anyone I'd get up and leave go home and do what ever while feeling mad until the rest of the day. Until my Parents got home and i burst out crying because of all my anger and rage. Sadly I'd often have a go at my Parents... Making them feel down too because I was so upset about school. When ever i had a cold or a stomach bug in high school I'd wang it out for as long as possible.. I hated going to school... I think i had about 60% attendance. They once had a snow day because the snow was that bad teachers couldn't get in. I and others were told to show up. And we got marked in for the morning. then they told us to go home as only 10% of the teachers could make it in. And they maked EVERYONE IN THE SCHOOL Absent for the day. Resulting in everyone loosing attendance. not that it mattered for me. But i found that utter horse shit.  


After the Outburst i was no longer welcome at the form room. I don't remember what happened after that, I know someone was giving me abuse and calling me fat in the dining hall, It had been going on for months and I'd had enough, I went upto him and whacked him with a plastic chair, And left and went home, He at a later date started doing it again. Grinding me further and further to anger and misery, So one day i walked upto him and kicked him square in the face and everyone was freaking out, I told him to fuck himself, and tried to leave, And a fucking Mincey teacher grabbed me to stop me from leaving, So i broke his grip easily and left and went home. Bla bla you know the rest, I was suspended from school for about 2 weeks, Its funny that because in schools the people who get punished worse are the people either defending themselves, or someone who's been psysically and mentally abused and had their state grinded and grinded until you don't want to live anymore, But i used anger instead and lashed out, After that I talked with Cathy Cooper often. And eventually I was put in a seperate building to the school which was called the 'PLC' Personal Learning Center I'm not sure when it was established. but basically it was locally known as the 'Spack House' And i wasn't so keen on going because I was scared i was going to be mocked even worse, But basically I was forced. That wasn't great, But i suppose it was more peaceful than the main school, Teachers would come over for a lesson in the day. Maths teachers, ICT and such. Aswell as bullshit lessons to waste time because they couldn't get enough free lessons, Like Gardening and Work Experience. Work experience resulted in me and Tim (The Local School Idiot, Who'd often stress me the fuck out on purpose to laugh at me when i got mad) Told by the 'Caretakers' Of the school to pick up litter. I think it was just an excuse for the Caretakers to do less work than they do already the fuckwits. Gary the fucking pick, Tim the twat was pissing me off on purpose, so I threw a fucking spanner on the floor and said fuck it and left. Later he comes round saying i almost broke a £2000 projector screen which was mounted on the ceiling. Which was no way fucking near where i threw the spanner. The stupid fuckwit. So again. I left and went home. This happened often because By this point i give little to no FUCKS anymore. I was miserable, I was contemplating suicide. I'd often carve shit into my leg or arm with a knife because i was so pissed off, I'd always had leech friends online I'd played minecraft with teenagers similar to me talking about how they want to end their life and how they cut them selves. That I'm sick of. I've had at least 4 i can count friends who act like this online. And i truly beleive that there's just so much teenage anxt. Which made me feel even worse, Because i put all my effort into trying to make them feel better. It was degrading and waring on me. I always tried so hard to be a nice lovely person. But people would abuse or misuse that or would say I'm an awful person and I've always been an awful person, Because I was fed up for One Fucking Day.   


The PLC wasn't fucking great, I had literally nobody there. the people who ran it. One an Ex Police officer Miss Bolton.. She wasn't bad. I did hate the fact she'd always punish me because I'd tell Tim to stop trying to piss me off. Or I forgot my stuff or something. She'd Give Me Isolations and Detentions like nobodys bloody buisiness. But at least she wasn't as bad as the other one Karen fucking Taylor. Now she was a massive bitch, The best way to describe her is Delores Umbridge from Harry Potter. around authority she'd be high pitched nice as pie, but you could just tell she gave off massive bitch vibes. Once she was talking to my Mum about How I. I. Was 'Bulling Tim' by telling him to please leave me fucking alone while I'm trying to do work. He'd trying and talk crap and make noises while I'm trying to do work. Its like Shrek and Donkey in Shrek 2 when they're in the Carridge on their way to Far Far Away to meet Fiona's Parents. Making annoying fucking noises and chatting shit.  


And to no supprise I saw more of CAMHS specifically with someone called Terri Anne, Now she seemed okay at first, But she fucking suddenly grew to piss me the fuck off. Always disreguarding my worries and anxieties, She might think she was helping trying to help me feel like what i worry about is silly, And I agree my Body is stupid, But i literally can't help it. My Anxiety doesn't have an On or Off switch. I truly didn't like my Worries being rationalised. And the next time i refused to talk to her. and said I didn't fucking care. and She was annoyed by the fact I'd sworn. Yet her previous role was mental health in prisons, Grow the fuck up. Are you telling me, Me saying fuck is worse than anything she's seen in prisons. Bullshit. But by that time I'd become over 16 and was passed onto the equally useless adult mental health services equally starved of funding by the same government who starves all over facilities.   


I was completely and utterly pissed off and mad with the services from CAMHS, and One of my later visits to CAMHS I'd met this trainee psychiatrist called James who spoke to me like I was 5. Really slow but up beat as If i didn't understand english. After that I was so pissed off i kicked the air and my shoe flew at least 30 foot in the air. I broke down screaming and crying. I didn't hit someones car luckily.  


Another story of CAMHS is i once met a woman who was also a Trainee like that 'James' And she wanted to shove a Camera in my face to record her performance as a Mental Health person. aka a group of people would watch back the footage of me trying to open up to some robotic woman who couldn't get a true emotional response from a rock.   


Basically i started going to the Ashcombe Centre which I'd always be extremely nervous for... I'd ask my Mum to not tell me.. Because I'd get so anxous i couldn't sleep the night before because i so badly didn't want to go.. Because of the first woman I met.. She was awful she seemed so disrespectful for the lack of a better word... She seemed like a total and utter psychopath, I don't know what was wrong with her, But talking with her was extremely unpleasant and made me really uncomfortable. She also had this assistant who'd right down stuff on a clipboard, The second time i went i couldn't handle it, And swore alot due to stress. Then the clipboard person started shaking and crying. and the Psychiatrist or should i say Psychopath said 'Please save these vulgar words for outside your mum wont want to hear this and your upsetting... I can't remember her name, So i got up and said, RIGHT FUCK YOU, I'M SICK OF THE WAY YOU ACT I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS. (I know this seems extremely unreasonable, But i was really stressed and It had built up over a while. She was always really rude and sarcastic. So i got up, left the room, the Door slammed on the way out. I walked into a locked door and then pressed the green button to release it. And went straight out of the door (3 Green Button Doors Later) Anyway.. The next time my Appointment was booked on a ... Wednesday or Thursday.. I can't remember, And guess what day that was... Schizophrenic medication day. and Holy fuck was I terrified. Not to be cruel to people with Schizophrenia but they're absolutely terrifying... Especially with anxiety... What if for some reason a person took a disliking to you.. They were just really on edge and scary... I couldn't wait to be called in.. I was already anxious that day, and that made it worse. I went in to see the same 'Psychopath' Woman. And I sit down and the first thing she says. 'Wesley If we get a repeat of last time we will have to call the police to restrain you and lock you up if you get agressive and violent and damage property like you did before.'  
I got up and said 'Okay Then' Extremely calmly. Made sure the door didn't slam on the way out, My Mum followed with me.  


Its funny because i feel most people who work in Mental Health. Need Mental Health treatment themselves.  


Basically my Parents had to write a letter asking them about why that happened. And about a week or so after that we received a letter saying that she will no longer be working there anymore and moving to a different branch. (Clearly she must have had multiple complaints) She was just really really awful.  


But after that it was about Half a year or so before we got any further contact from the ashcombe centre. But we got a letter saying we're having an appointment with the big boss psychiatrist man. I was really nervous... I'd chilled out abit because we'd not had to go for so long. And basically in the appointments I was planning to be really defensive and speak as less as possible as not to cause trouble for me or my parents. But anyway this guy Dr Darren Carr. Supprisingly enough he seemed to know what he was talking about. I Loved his brutal honnesty. He seemed like the first person I've ever met who knew anything about Mental Health. Instead of sounding like he was reading off a script (Like all the others) I think he seemed to truly understand what he was talking about. He did suggest I could possibly have 'Selective Mutism' Which I don't think it true. I was just really nervous and didn't want to speak to avoid me getting angry or getting into law trouble. I was just really scared and didn't know how to open up properly. But he told me that basically there's not alot that can be done. Mental Health is one of the worst brands of Medical things out there. Its so hard to help or stop Mental Health issues. The only things that seem to work is, Medication, CBT and Talking. and I'm not good at talking about my feelings or writing a diary.. And i was too scared to try CBT because i knew it wouldn't work and it would all be for nothing... But I loved his brutal honnesty. It truly spoke to me.  


I have felt sometimes i want to try CBT but its so much effort to set it up. And it wont be with Him It'll be some other random nurse... And its hard to get to know strangers like that... They aren't your friend, they are there to get paid and do work. I suppose it is their job to help you and thats what they get paid for.. But Its like opening up to the T-800 from terminator... It doesn't feel right to me.   
And also don't forget there would be group sessions with other people... And I couldn't handle that... It would be Awful. I can force myself to talk to people if i need to.. But it wares me out, stresses me out and I can't do it for very long... I'm on Support Benefits, Which I often feel bad for because its so so hard to get them. The DWP's job is to deny as many people as possible because there's so many who abuse the system. and the People who abuse the system always seem to get it. Where as the people who really need it and go thousands into debt with a bank don't. Its really disgusting. I don't like to think of myself as Mental and Uncapable of work.. But If I'm brutally honnest.. I can't I'm a danger to myself and others sometimes. And I'd get way too stressed doing some crappy work like a shop worker. I couldn't handle people, And I couldn't do further education.. I'd want to in an Ideal world. Retake my GCSE's and Get a REAL education... But I'd apply.. Spend Hundreds on it... Then either Give up or Flip Out.   


I've never been able to cure my Anxiety, Depression, or Any Other Mental Issues I Don't Know About, Because I'm such a Cynical and Pesimistic Arsehole It seems Impossible for me to find something that helps my anxiety, Pills and Medication can only do so much your mental health, It isn't easily as cured as most Physical Health It requires so much mental work. Therapists can't do anything for me, All a therapist can do is talk to you, suggest strategies that could help you, perscribe you pills. The only thing that was suggested to me is CBT which they try and teach your brain not to be anxious. But I was either too scared to try or shrugged it off as bullshit. I think if you truly beleive that something will help you (Which is hard) I've tried to beleive that something will help me, but I've just faked it to myself and it didn't work.  Sadly I and my Brain truly beleive that If i get into a true meaningful relationship with someone, It'll help me grow up and become a proper adult and stop this Anxiety crap. But you can't force people to like you, and I don't want to be in a fake relationship, I want someone who loves me as much as i Love them. and I find it so easy to fall for people, and then they realise they don't like my body, appearance or personality, Which is understandable but its always a big blow, I've not once had a relationship past the age of 11, I had a little kid relationship that ended when i moved away, Since that time I've managed to realise what life is and what relationships are for. I never understood it as a kid, I may not now but i truly think I've discovered it. I just feel that If i work on caring about someone and living life, That I'll push that shit away. Especially with the person i like, She's super strong and wouldn't have any tolerance for my weakness which i feel could be a really good thing i've been left to myself for about 5 years now, left to my own thoughs and its no good.   


Every time i think about the person It makes me feel Like I want to clean myself up... Some how... How would i cure my Anxiety to make myself a better person.

158,"Hey all, first time poster here. I usually don't go online for personal help but I am lost and need any help I could get. 

I feel like I need to give some background first before I can explain what I've been going through. I have to travel a lot throughout my life because of my parents job. For this reason I moved to NYC for 6 years and lived there from 12 to 18 years old graduating high school in the process. In my final year I lived with a friend because my parents had to move away. Since I'm an EU citizen we decided early on that I would attend college in the EU mainly because of outrageous international fees in the U.S. I've always wanted to stay in the U.S so more or less behind my parents back I applied to some U.S schools and got into some public and private schools which ranged in between 10k to 50k in pricing some were simply unaffordable but some worked. At the same time I got into a really good U.K school and ended up coming here for college much to my disappointment. I was extremely happy during the last few years in high school. I've been with a girl I love since I was 16 and I had an amazing group of friends. When I found out I was going to move to the UK I was really sad that I would have to give up seeing my friends and girlfriend so much but I understood that I am not American and it's what made the most sense. Despite my feelings I tried to be keep my hopes up that I would enjoy London and moving back in with my family. 

Which brings me to why I'm here reaching out for help. I hate my life right now. I found it really hard to adapt to college life. I have two days of classes per week and it's been really tough to make friends as I had no friends coming in and barely attend school. I quickly lost hope after I didn't make many friends and entered a vicious cycle where I sleep between 4 and 7 am. My american friends all know this and as much as they can give words of encouragement I feel stuck like everything is so hard. My grades are barely passing, I feel alone and have no aspirations. I'm doing a politics and international relations course that I have grown to really despise. I've always had an interest in these subjects but not anymore. I barely sleep or do work I mostly just sit at home playing video games and smoking. I gave up smoking during the summer between high school (2019) and college but quickly picked it back up again when I got here. My girlfriend moved to California and right now we are on a break because she's tired of waiting for me to get my life back together. I don't blame her she tried to help me over the course of many months but I feel as though everything is so hard.. I care about school and I rely on friends a lot but I've lost hope. I can't find a way out of this cycle of playing games all day and sleeping late and it's been hurting my american friendships and girlfriend, grades, family relationships. I don't know what I want to do in life and I just feel like I have no vision for my future and no way out. I don't know if moving to the U.S would magically resolve all these issues but I just feel alone. I've argued with my parents countless times about college and where I live and they constantly try to tell me that I just have to try harder. I'm a shy person but once i warm up I'm very open and relaxed but I can't find the motivation for anything. Now that quarantine hit it's basically the end of the school year and I feel like I just wasted an entire year. I didn't exactly learn much and i feel as though my maturity and individuality moved backwards. I once again rely on my family for things like food and money which at 19 years old isn't the end of the world but it's not like I'm improving while i rely on them. I'd like to end this post by just saying that for a while now I've felt as though I shouldn't be feeling this way. In theory, I have a family, a decent living (financially) and a girlfriend (even-though we're long distance and she's been having doubts about us) so i almost feel like there's so many people who've got it worse than me which means I shouldn't feel this way but i do and it makes me feel guilty.",18Apr2020,1
159,"I need to let this out because I swear it’s driving me mad but my pet peeve is people telling me “it’s all in you’re head” or “it’s all in you’re mind” every time I voice anything I’m struggling with or talk about my mental illnesses some of the people I confine in are quick to just tell me it’s all in my head and not to think about it. Its extremely dismissive behavior and it’s invalidating it just makes me not want to talk about what I’m going through mentally at all. I know they mean no harm but it’s just please be more careful with you’re wording. The reason why it gets under my skin so much is because when anyone says “it’s all in you’re mind” i feel like they’re suggesting it’s psychosomatic. My symptoms are real my illness is real trust me if anyone with a mental illness could just say maybe it is all in my head and be cured we all would be fine!!  
I have bipolar disorder and DDD and I have been getting these comments from my friends who also have diagnosis of depression,OCD, anxiety and sleep disorder. I just don’t understand why they don’t understand how harmful comments like these are I know my hallucinations, delusions, and mood swings is my brain toying with me I understand that but In that moment those hallucinations are my reality I can’t just say hey it’s all in my head and it goes away. 

I just needed to let all this out I wanna find a way to talk to my friends and family without sounding rude or mean or insensitive but this is something I want to address what do you guys think? Have you experience anything similar? Or what are you’re opinions on it? :)",18Apr2020,2

161,"So I have been feeling like shit the past three weeks, and today I feel like I have hit a new low. I haven't been feeling great, I'm so stressed and anxious. I work from home and things being so terrible.  
I have applied for another job when life was normal, and yesterday I got a replay from them saying that they are sorry and stuff, and I was so sad about it because I kind of wanted this job, you know? Before that I asked one of my closest friends about something related to work, and I needed her opinion about it, but she read it and didn't replay!! And I got angry because I always reply to her I know that no one asked me to! When the news about the job came in I sent her their messages and she told me like it's their loss and everything. She was quite supportive about it. Then she asked me about something a problem at her work, and she needed my opinion. And I was quite an asshole with her! She was obviously under a lot of stress about that problem and she probably wanted some support.  I gave her my opinion but it was not as usual, it was bland. I went to bed and I kept thinking about what I did to her so at three in the morning I texted her saying I'm sorry I was not supportive enough.  I do care about you but I wasn't having the best day. Let's talk about it again when you wake up. Then she replied when she woke up I'm assuming: ""you don't have to be sad about it because you did nothing wrong, chill."" 
And her words annoyed me so much and I don't know why!! So I wanted to start a conversation with her but her answers were short, and she didn't replay to some of my questions which she normally would!! 

That happend like 6 hours ago, and know I'm feeling very very sad, very angry and irritated!! Have I done something wrong?

It's on and off but over the last 7 months I've had more time where I can't breath easily than time I can, often I spend a week without breathing fully or easily.

It's making general life very difficult, and it's messing with my sleep and body badly, and my exercise,(I get out of breath easily (and that's not like me, I used to be able to run 5 miles in like 30 -40 minutes, and I have no underlying health problems (checked with doctor))).

I also can't yawn probably 8/10 times I try to. 

I also can't run or walk up the stairs without feeling a panic attack or some kind of flight or right response, infact the other night I got up to go to the toilet, which is on the same floor, and I almost had a panic attack just from walking 4 metres.

They would tell me that I was manic. For years, I thought that this was my lot in life, and to be quite honest, it could be. I just wish my folks had taken me to see someone when I was a child to help me, but because I'm in my early 20's, it is now up to me to find out what's wrong with my brain. When I examine the criteria for bipolar disorder, I really don't fit the criteria for bipolar one or two. I've never had a manic episode or depressive episode. I've never had extreme highs or lows; the only thing I can really relate to is maybe the racing thoughts. When I was a child, I was very hyper...still am.

170,"Throwaway account.

These last 2-3 years I’ve been having a serious issue. No matter where I go, I get anxious and an existential crisis due to how ugly my brain perceives everything to be, even when I know it’s objectively beautiful. 

For example, I used to love hiking and being in nature, but I don’t know what happened, and nowadays I hate being outside my apartment because everything is so ugly and depressing. I’ve been to forests, mountains, beaches, cities and everything is so ugly to me. Another example, I was in Barcelona for 2 weeks for work, and I just felt the need to get out the entire time, even though I think nobody would say Barcelona is ugly. Lovely city, but I hated it. Krakow? Lovely city, hated it. Hamburg? Lovely city, hated it.

I can’t do tasks downtown without getting an existential crisis because it’s so ugly. So here I am in my apartment never going out anymore, except for work. (Or well, before the whole corona thing at least..)

Interestingly I’m not really depressed in general. I have a lovely girlfriend, a stable job I like, a stable living situation and no traumatic experiences in the past. I don’t think I’m a very unhappy person. I just can’t go outside anymore without feeling sad. And as an extroverted person, that drives me insane.

The only times I’ve felt happy outside is when I’ve been to work trips to northern Norway and in the Utrecht-area, and when I’m drunk.

Is there some psychological phenomenon for this? I just want to see and feel beauty again.",18Apr2020,3

Hi, 

It’s true when we dont care about how someone sees us, we act normal or even rude sometimes. Few months ago, my crush and I were just dormmates. I didnt even think of her at all. I was being “over comfortable” with things that I think embarassing now. However, whenever I remember those memories or have flashbacks I feel so disgusted with myself. Ashamed. And somewhat anxious of “what if she remembers how I acted and that formed in her head forever?” 
How do I even erase that image of me that had formed in her head? 

Whenever I remember those moments, I get pain in my chest and face cringes. Its like all the blood rushes to my face in shame. 
I like her and I want to look as attractive in her eyes. Just as she ever wanted. I wanted to be her potential someone. My crush is really pretty. She takes good care of herself. She smells good and dresses up nice. I like her even with her flaws. Her sense of humor. Her softness and feminity. 

Would anyone please help me get over those disgusting flashbacks that bring anxiety. 

Thank you,",18Apr2020,2

175,"Like many I'm sure, the lockdown is doing a right number on my anxiety + depression (I have other conditions too but I these are the most pertinent). I was diagnosed with these btw. However that's a bit bye the bye. I'm currently waiting on an ambulance (not from self harm but admitted to hospital because of coronavirus symptoms) .

&amp;#x200B;

I was chatting to my best friend - we met at University, she's from Taiwan, I'm from UK -  and she's worried about me, recorded a little voice message etc. But then I replied and...all of a sudden that old demon of feeling like ""You shouldn't bother. You're annoying. Nobody likes you, or likes hearing from you. Just be quiet and die quietly"" came roaring back. Long time no see &gt;\_&gt;

When I did CBT, the lady I was talking to mentioned using a One Minute Rule, time to suit the individual. If you need to, think about the situation. Think ""Is there a reason Person X would feel this way about me? Is there any evidence?"" etc. But once that mental timer is up, push it out of mind.

But its not working. Like. The sum of my reply was the equivalent of ""Thank you! This helps &amp; means a lot. Love you, talk soon"" (we say love a lot) but idk. Its that inescapable weight round your neck, something weighing you down.

And it happens in ways that the root issues don’t appear all that obviously to me right away. Which sucks, because it doesn’t actually make me feel better at all to react so strongly or drag others into it, all it does is make me feel less alone in my misery. Which now I can also recognize that this coping skill is something I’ve learned from my grandmother who raised me, which equally sucks. 

No wonder my SO is miserable with me. Of course I haven’t been really aware of it when I’m doing it, until recently. The issues I’m having which I’m using this coping skill for are largely out of my control, and finding acceptance with that and letting it go is so difficult. 

I definitely try to cling to the familiarity that comes with emotional chaos, because without it I kinda have face myself and see how much I’m hurting and how much of the hurt is due to things that were done to me in the past. Those things are totally beyond my control now. All the childhood abuse and neglect and the things I never knew were all that wrong, which now take so much effort to function through in my adulthood. The hurt from it isn’t something I want to face, subconsciously I would prefer to take myself back to the time where all the pain still felt comfortable and normal. 

I know I’m probably making myself sound like a really bad person, but I don’t enjoy being this way. I’m in therapy, on meds, really trying to improve myself and now I can see that this is part of why my progress has been stunted these past few months.

For example once in boarding school I had no lunch and was hungry, so I asked my friend to order a pizza for me (for my money and in exchange for a slice) as I did not know the pizza delivery address at the time. My other “friend” however noticed only the giving a slice to the other friend bit and so asked if he could have some too. Me, seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen our friendship, agreed. The only problem is that when the pizza arrived, HE TOOK HALF THE F*CKING THING AND RAN OFF. As a result I only had 2 small slices left and was left hungry for the rest of the day.

The other example happened during a paintball match we had for the pizza stealing friend’s birthday. Me and my group had to storm an enemy fortification and I reckoned that of all 5 of us attack at the same time from different sides, we would be able to take it. The only problem is that those bastards betrayed me at the last second as I charged, leaving me to be pounded with some 25-30 pellets to the torso and knees. To add insult to injury, they started laughing as I laid there, shocked with fury and pain. THEN to add more injury and insults into the fire, one of my “friends” that was in the fort, decided to make sure I was dead by firing a volley at my knees just as I was recovering. We ended up losing the match anyway and the best they had to offer to me after the fact was that they called me a “champ”

Yeah, I guess I need help as these memories surface up from time to time and make me very upset",18Apr2020,1

Whenever I hear about illnesses or perverted fetishes, I can't stop thinking that I'm might have them myself. Over and over again. No logical argumention helps. It's just a vicious train of thoughts and anxiety.

I also think that I might be autistic (many symptoms overlap). I am socially awkward, rarely feel empathy, constantly do repetitive moves like pacing around the room while daydreaming (I can do this for hours with music or the same movie trailers), etc. Maladaptive dreaming is linked to OCD. 

On top of that, I suffer from a very strong libido. I constantly have an urge to masturbate, which makes me think that I'm an addict. My addiction leads to kinky fetishes (for example, I really enjoy verbal degradation). I've read one study, which states that people with autism are more prone to that. 

I am in the middle of a severe depression. I try to watch movies, read books in my free time to distract myself from my obtrusive, but nothing helps.

201,"TLDR - I get so happy and so depressed sometimes that when looking back I’m convinced I’m faking. How do I convince myself it was genuine? 

I go throw mood swings, where about a week a month I’m depressed af and a week a month I’m on top of the world. I don’t have any help or diagnosis at the moment, so I’m trying to put up with them, but I’m finding it so hard to believe that I’m sick because I spend half the time feeling fine and am really struggling to believe myself

Whenever I’m up or down, I’m an entirely different person. I dress differently, listen to different music, different hobbies, eating habits, I have different opinions of people and views of topics (eg, smoking, drinking, drugs, skipping college - not that I do all that, I just view the subject entirely differently when up or down), and I have a totally different thought process. I can’t ever picture myself vaping or self harming, but I’ve done both because at the time it was all I wanted, even if I hate the concept of both and have said I’d never do it again. 

There’s such a strong disconnect that I struggle believing that I even did those things; it’s like my brain won’t accept that was genuine. Sometimes I’m convinced I’m faking because rn I would never do it. I must have been attention seeking or playing it up. I never actually felt that bad. I was trying to act cocky in front of people. I’m not embarrassed of the things I’ve done, I just feel like a fraud. 

Logically I know that’s what I wanted at the time, but I can’t get myself to stop thinking I’m faking. I’ve tried journaling through these moods but reading back through them feels like pages of lies. I can’t convince myself that what I was writing was genuine. 

Anyone any advice on how to limit this disconnect?",18Apr2020,3

I've thought about maybe telling him I kinda get super anxious when I don't know why he's gone, although it sounds manipulative to say that 

I think I might know why I feel this way, so as a child my dad worked overseas most of the time, and when he was home he wasn't the best, when I was 13 or so my dad stopped working which caused my mom to attack him, cause of that I dropped out of school and lost my friends and became isolated from my parents, my dad starts working abroad, during this time my sister was in Canada, she came back, and she hated living in the house cause it was a mess, and during that time I told her the reason I left school was cause of my mom, my sister said she that she would be there for me, but she wasn't, she went back to  Canada. During that time my dad came back to try and get a job in the country, although my mom moved out of the house and left us with him, and I remember arguing with him a lot cause he would drink a lot, then I move back into living with my mom, at this point my parents had broken up cause of my mom cheating, although while I was living with my dad my mom became accustomed to living with her BF, so she didn't actually live in the house with us despite being our guardian, anyway so my dad could still come by and he came into the house, and he wasn't leaving ,but there wasn't anyone around and I didn't want to leave the room cause he'd start snooping around, anyway, so I threw a tennis ball at his direction, and he became furious and walked up to me and threatened me, tbh in that moment I wanted to hit him, i'm not sure if I thought I could take him, but I thought it would make something happen, and I wouldn't have to deal with him anymore. Anyway I didn't, but after that I blocked him on my phone and stopped contacting him, he wasn't allowed to come by after that, which leads us to now, i live with my younger brother, older sister and uncle, my mom still doesn't live here and hasn't lived in the house for years. anyway, so atm I don't really have any friends, don't really have any family, don't really have any formal education, idk, I just don't seem to have a ton of stuff and the things I do I get pretty scared to lose",18Apr2020,1

217,"For this post, I'm going to call my sister Kim. I am currently 18 and she is a year or two younger than me. Not going into detail on us. I'll also preface that she knows about this post since I asked her permission to ask you guys, to which she agreed to. So if you want to speak to her directly in your answers, then that's fine. 

Oh, where do I even begin? This is going to be a long one. 

She recently messaged me, saying that she had something she wanted to tell me but didn't want to talk to me face-to-face about. I egged her on pretty harshly about it as I was dying from curiosity. That was until she sent me a multiple page PowerPoint presentation explaining that she realized that she may be suffering from DID ( Dissociative identity disorder) and/or OSDD ( Other Specified Dissociative Disorders). I'm not going to share this PowerPoint with you guys due to anonymity reasons. 

Before I continue on, let me also preface that I have suffered from depression, paranoia, rare reoccurring random sounds and voices in my head, and some pretty creepy episodes of physical hallucinations in the past (I saw a therapist about my problems and am now fine.) I don't know anything about psychology, but this has me thinking that we lost the genetic lottery. 

Now then, moving on. Kim has told me that she has suffered from the symptoms I'm about to list since the second grade, but hasn't told anyone about it because she didn't want them to think that she was crazy. She has only talked to her closest friends and also me about it. Kim has emphasized that she refuses to let our family find out about it since she believes that they would doubt and alienate her. 

She claims to:

* Have around nine alters within her head. They all have different appearances and personalities, and she has also given each of them a name. 
* Kim said that one of them is always ""fronting"" but I don't really understand what she means by this. To me, she has always seemed like the same Kim. I'll admit that she has random bouts of unexplainable anger and hate towards me, which could support this.
*  She also says that she has a little amnesia based on who is fronting. In the past, I have noticed that her memory is very bad. We both watch a bit of anime and it is common for her to forget entire plots and character casts a year after watching it while I remember most things from anime that I watched years ago. 
* She says that she hears random sentences and monologues of her alters in her head. An example she gave was from last night when she was trying to sleep. One of her alters commented something like ""Okay tictok is so great."" Another one then said ""Mmm no, ever baked a pie."" She experiences random monologues like this in her head throughout the day. 
* The voices are definitely coming from her head. I asked her specifically that. 
* She has begun to refer to herself as ""we"" and this worries me immensely. 

A quote from her that I don't really know how to paraphrase: "" We've got like this inner world place, look the more I talk about it the more I feel insane an overthink it. Just know I've already researched everything and I would tell u I have osdd if I wasnt absolutely sure. However theres this one alter who is constantly doubting it, and its frustration lmao"".

I asked her many questions about her experience in order to figure it out the best for myself. I shall present this upcoming section in a Q&amp;A format. 

**Q:**  ""Are one of the alters violent or give you violent thoughts, tendencies, etcetera?"" 

**A:**  ""Eh we still figuring everyone out. I know we've got a gatekeeper, 2 host, a protector, and a little. Ur talking about a persecutor, then yeah we've got him too, but he's not very active and hes the most disconnected from the host""

**Q:**  ""Can you define these terms? Gatekeeper, host, protector, and little?"" 

**A:**  ""Yaaa so gatekeeper keeps and decides who's allowed to front, host are people who front the most for the longest time. Core is the person who identifies with the body and holds the farthest back memories. Protector is an alter made for like stress. Someone who tries to protect the system and stuff. Like only fronts when triggered by a situation where the system would need to be protected? Then little is a very young alter, ours is like 10. Persecutor is an alter made for like stress relief and basic spends most their time making bad decisions and influencing other alters lol.  We're still figuring out everyone's roles, but ik alters are made and developed for certain reasonsss.""

I have not asked any more questions. What I have decided for the time being and told her is that:

""Right now I'm planning to speak to my therapist and make a deal. I'll refer him to you under the circumstance that he does not speak of any of it to our family. He will agree to that, but if you speak about anything physically threatening or harmful to yourself or your surroundings, then he will be forced to tell people.""

She responded with:

""That's okay, I'm not a threat to myself or anyone. All things considered I think we have it pretty under control. I told my councilor I had a friend and explained some things to her, pretending it was a friend not me. She said we should see a physiatrist who takes our health insurance. Anyways maybe try to see if he understand did first? I hear some people dont believe in it and I dont wanna end up in a situation where someone tries to tell me I dont exist.""

Where do I go from here? I'm taking this very seriously. Mental health is no joke. I know that, especially after going through some bad episodes in the past. Since I trust her, I'm assuming that she's not messing with me or doing this for attention. 

On a side note, after this conversation was over, she told me:

""Okay dont overthink it. I wasnt really planning for u to go detective mode lmao.  I'm just vibin with my new self.""

This whole thing has got me a little thrown off. I'm going to treat her the same as always though.",18Apr2020,1

222,"So I had some horrible things happened to me as a kid.  Almost died a few times, drowning, getting run over and so on. But all that gave me the strength to try to be a better &amp; a normal person and try to help people as much as I can growing up. I also got a morale boost when I realized I could help change some of the horrible things I COULD control, but that took me years to realize.

Meanwhile, I learned to fall in love, and then eventually broke her heart, which eventually broke mine.  Even that was so traumatic to me as a kid that, after my family moved, and when I came back to the same town a few years later temporarily, I realized how much she had to go through because I broke her heart and some other actions. I realized how much I had forgotten about the things that used to matter.

I realized then, that my brain tends to forget emotionally upsetting things like this, it tries to keep them in the deepest darkest recesses of my mind, barely letting me remember them. Helping me make the same mistakes again and again.

So I tried to move on as much as I could, I was in my early teens. I made new friends, eventually fallen in love. Many other things that I would like to forget happened before, after and in-between. But things were happy enough for me at the time, but I made some stupid decisions. 

I was a high school senior &amp; I pushed away my girlfriend I was in a relationship with for a year, the love of my life. And some times later, the guys, my friend circle for 5-6 years broke up over something stupid and despite my best efforts. And all these made my grades fall really low and things got bad at home after I graduated with a lower grade which is important in where I live and even more important for my parents.

It took me years to get over all this, and I eventually did but many other things happened before, after and in-between.  I took a year off before starting college which although didn't bother me at first, is starting to bother me now, seeing falling behind my friends.

Sometimes ago, many of those things my brain tried to forget came to haunt me like ghosts from the past. As those NDEs made me feel more for people and much deeply, that backfired, as the slightest recollection of things would leave me with anxiety or panic even attacks.

I couldn't tell anybody about it at the time and didn't want to. It took me some time, but when I came out of this tunnel, I wasn't feeling the anxiety anymore nor the panic attacks. I eventually realized I wasn't sure If I feeling anything good or bad, barely anymore.

Before all this, I remember playing video games felt fun, so I kept playing video games more and more even though I wasn't sure If I was having as much fun. I used to love those facts or trivia videos on YouTube but never as much to the extent as I watch them now and I find some if not most of them not fun or even boring.

All these attempts of me to try to understand my feelings started to affect my grades. At some point, I could barely focus for more than 10-15 minutes. And massively hamper my productivity. The tradition of where I live in, is usually children stay with their parents, many before marriage, many even after.

I am taking 6-7 years to get my undergraduate degree that is supposed to be done in 3-4 years. My grades are appalling despite my efforts. No Matter how good a semester starts, it's like a bipolar cycle that I get a low productivity time once or twice in every 4 moth semester. Some for a few days, some for weeks. I haven't had any relationship for all this time. My social life suffers every time I'm in a low cycle. 

And my financial situation isn't helping much either. Too afraid to get even a part-time job risking my grades even more and letting people down at my job when a  bad cycle hits and I don't feel like going out of my room for weeks.

I'm old enough now, and many of my friends are getting married, which is gradually is starting to be worrying, me still not finishing my undergrad, no job, no relationship, barely any long term friends since after starting college for all this time, and my mental and emotional mess with bio-polar like ups and downs cycle which at this point feels more like bipolar syndrome to me.

Things are getting even worse with me not being able to understand the depth of the emotion that I'm feeling. I know If I don't properly finish the work I'm given, I will probably fail this semester. I don't feel as stressed as I once would have, but I hardly feel any stress at all, to the point that I don't even feel the motivation to finish my projects and assignments.This is just one example in studying. I have been doing similar things in my social life, even with my family, parents and siblings who tried again and again to help and many times needed help.  

If I would do a self-analysis, just from this, I would say that I have, 

\- Bipolar disorder

\- Internet addiction

\- Gaming Addiction

\- PTSD

\- Memory problems

\- Emotional depth problem and lack of motivation

\- Lack of time management

And that's just off the top of my head from this. Some of these problems can't be helped since I'm studying Computer Science and I am glued to my computer most of the time for one reason or another.

After all this, I wanted to ask something, and I wasn't sure which reddit to go to so I'm asking here,   
1. Is my self-analysis is erroneous in any way?

2. Am I truly having problems with understanding the types or depth of my emotions? If not, what else is it from what I've written here?

3. How can I lessen my internet and gaming addiction and be more productive for my particular case while studying computer engineering?

4. How can I be more social and productive when those downturns hit me and make me all depressed and waste more and more time and opportunities?",18Apr2020,1

224,"2018-2019 were really rough for me for many reasons and I felt like I just couldn’t get a break. I felt like I was an ant and god was like a child pointing a magnifying glass on me, aiming it so that the sun would burn and kill me. That’s how all of the last two years felt for me. 

I kept saying to everyone, “I just need one win, just one and then I’ll be okay and able to snowball happiness from that one win”. I convinced myself of this, so I waited and waited.

Finally at the beginning of this year I got two of the things I was working so hard for - I bought a condo and moved out of toxic family environment to live on my own and I attained a destination I worked really hard for.

Initially, I felt amazing. I couldn’t believe it and it almost didn’t feel real after all the shit I went through. 

But eventually I was like “is that it?”. I kept feeling like wait, wasn’t this supposed to change everything for me? Wasn’t this supposed to be my ticket to happiness?

Surprise, surprise, it wasn’t. This is not to say things haven’t improved for me and that I’m not grateful for what I have. This just says that I’m finally realizing that maybe even getting what I want isn’t going to fix me. 

I decided, okay maybe it’s because I’m taking all this for granted so I try to actively practice gratitude daily but it still doesn’t help me. If anything, I’m getting worse! I’m stuck in this utter spiral of self-hatred, body dysmorphia, imposter syndrome, loneliness, sadness and frustration. 

What will it take for me to be happy? I don’t even know anymore. I can’t get the courage to see a doctor. I’m so afraid.",18Apr2020,2

227,"My mom and siblings have excellent, interesting conversations, are genuinely interested in each other’s emotions, truly care about each other, and are overall really social with each other. With me? I’m the family outcast. They’re never rude to me directly, but my mom only really talks to me to ask if I took my meds and how my college applications are doing. My siblings avoid me because I can’t hold a conversation/use English fluently like a normal person, every word from my mouth makes it more obvious to them that I’m a mental disaster. In short, you know you suck when your family knows you suck.",18Apr2020,2
228,"I've been feeling overwhelmed and depressed and I think that I have been killing this feeling with working almost nonstop. I love working, but it might be affecting too much of my life rn. I can't sleep, I'm worried sick about where my life is going, I'm in a weird kind of relationship which isn't a relationship (I'm not even sure what it is). It's been too much on me lately...
I either work, or cry in my bed because I can't sleep with these feelings of sadness and uncertainty.
Anybody have tips on how to get some balance? I've tried things like meditation, online courses, I've even been on medication (antidepressants). I always get back to this awfully painful state.
Thanks for any tips.",18Apr2020,1
229,"Hi Everyone, I’m writing because I’m starting to get worried about my mental health. I don’t know how to describe what I’m experiencing but i will try my best. I’ve always been good at school, had good grades although I didn’t ever revise. I loved maths and got an amazing grade, i just loved every single bit of it ( I’m telling you this because i will use it later.) i have an Engineering Diploma, i am also told that i am very smart although I don’t see it personally but the reason why I’m naming all this is because i am not uneducated or lazy or anything. Anyway let me explain what I’m having trouble with... i am having trouble with remembering things, learning new things and just using ‘common sense’. I’m a gamer and even that is hard for me now, for a while now I can’t even play a game without doing really bad. More and more i notice that I’m having trouble with stuff. For example, i just became a manager at my work, I’ve had trouble remembering everything to do with that role, and now I’m having trouble counting stupid money although thats what i enjoy. Counting!  I have £10,£20 and £5 notes and I can’t even count them correctly to £200 at the end of the shift. I seem to do things different than others and i end up doing them the hard and wrong way. What could all this mean. I’m really worried now",18Apr2020,1

231,"So a lot has happened in my life in the past year. A lot has changed including how I felt about my sexuality. 

Last week I came out to the person who I trusted the most with how I felt. 

Yesterday morning I came out to a few other friends and publicly to strangers on twitter. Then last night I came out to my friends and family on Facebook. 

Every single person who saw my posts have done nothing but say nice things, congratulate me and support me. 

Coming out to everyone has helped lift a huge weight off my shoulders and I've been thinking clearly, not constantly worrying about it. 

I'll be honest, I was scared to death. It was a huge step for me. 

Over the last week I've been building up the confidence to come out. In the end I remembered that I don't care what people think of me. So to put it bluntly and straight to the point I posted ""I'm coming out as bi, if you don't like it you can kindly fuck off"" 

Every single person in my life has come out to support me. 

I'm currently looking for my first girlfriend and maybe the love of my life. 

I haven't been this happy in so long. Being honest with myself and everyone around me has made me feel so confident. 

I feel like this is a step in the right direction to helping my mental health because it's one less thing I have to worry about. 

Don't be scared about coming out. If you want to talk to me about it I'm open and always here for anyone who needs it. I don't judge anyone and I like to think I'm easy going and kind. Don't be shy if you need someone to talk to about this. 

It doesn't matter what your gender is, your sexuality or how you identify. I'll always accept you and love you.",18Apr2020,4
232,"To give a bit of context, i'm massively into music. I've played guitar for 14 years, been in a band and have supported some pretty large bands, have toured uk and am releasing a new album/solo album soon, so essentially music is my entire life, but i cannot make a career out of it. I also suffer badly with depression and anxiety, as well as BPD and ADHD

I've fully accepted the fact that it's near impossible to make it big and live off of the music i make, due to the state of the industry and the genre we play (metalcore,) so i've made many attempts to get a more commercially viable job in the music industry.

I went to university to pursue music production, came out with a 2:1 (2nd highest grade achievable) and attempted to pursue a career in production, but quickly realised that i not only did have the money or talent to do it. The vocalist of my band who is entirely self taught is miles better than me and is producing my solo EP, which made me think that i'm not good enough for it, justifying it by how many people are already out there doing it.

I then tried to get into live sound, and was shot down multiple times by other live sound engineers or venues, even when i ask to shadow the sound guy unpaid one day a week or anything, just to get some experience. 

The thing i discovered recently, is that i'm really not bad at woodworking. I've built 2 guitars now, one of them works perfectly, but the second time i've tried to build the neck and i'm over 15 attempts in to the neck, wasted so much money and had really put me into a depressive state when i've been improving so much over the past few months.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl/dr; i keep failing at the things i love no matter how hard i try, how do i deal with this cause i feel like shit.",18Apr2020,1
