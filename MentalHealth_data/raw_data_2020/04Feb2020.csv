0,"Hi, so 6 months ago I went through an episode of psychosis, which was a pretty horrible experience as you can imagine. I‚Äôm no longer paranoid or delusional but I sadly don‚Äôt feel the way that I felt before the episode. I now have issues with low energy, low motivation, anhedonia, apathy and low mood. I don‚Äôt have the same passion/zest/enthusiasm for life that I had before and I feel like I‚Äôve lost my mojo to be honest. I have been off any medication (Olanzapine) for 2 months now so I would expect any withdrawal symptoms to be fading/have faded. I guess I‚Äôm just looking to see if anyone has any advice that could help/lifestyle changes that might help. I‚Äôm particularly interested in if anyone can think of any supplements that have helped them in similar situations?

TL;DR Had psychosis, now depressed. Please help!",04Feb2020,1
1,"For some reason these days I don‚Äôt eat at all? Sometimes I‚Äôll just work throughout the entire day and even though my body feels hunger I forget about it and just don‚Äôt make myself eat. From the time I woke up which was 7am to 7pm (now) I just realized I haven‚Äôt ate the entire day and then I start to feel a deep pain in my stomach. My parents keep saying I‚Äôm losing weight but I don‚Äôt really see a difference at all, i just feel like I look the same. I am not intentionally starving myself but I also just keep forgetting to eat and that I‚Äôm hungry . What is this??? Why is this happening??",04Feb2020,1
2,"I‚Äôm slowly turning into the kind of people I hate. I‚Äôm fat, I‚Äôm lazy, all I do is sit around and do nothing. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore because I‚Äôm barely able to get hours at my work. My depression has been better, and I‚Äôve been ‚Äúrecovering‚Äù but the sadness and emptiness I‚Äôve felt from my depression has turned into anger.",04Feb2020,1
3,"This is no trick or scam. I'm not asking for money. All I'm getting out of this is experience and helping others. I'm an advocate for Mental Health and pursuing a career in Councelling and volunteering to do this. Who wants to discuss openly their anxiety and depression troubles that are stopping them from their goals and are open to try new things, from an unbiased person, and want to know the life changing things I know?",04Feb2020,1
4,"So im 24 and have been dealing with depression for probably 9 years now. I started my new job 3 months ago and last monday i caved and finally went to seek help for the first time. I took all last week off and got put on medication and havent been feeling good at all since i guess it take around 2 weeks to kick in. I tried going in to work again today and just had a breakdown, i called a crisis line and spoke with a lady for 40 mins. After that i went back to the hospital and they basically just assured me that it takes time to work. 

I called my boss here since ive just been texting him since last week and spoke with him. He doesnt sound upset but he is clearly annoyed and only really cares about his business running smoothly. I told him what was going on and he asked me what depression was and i explained it to him. He just kept saying he doesnt understand and asking me when ill be back since its make him and the others job harder. I dont think hes trying to be rude its just hes religious and doesnt understand it.

Has anyone else had to deal with something like this and how do i go about it? I have a doctors note saying i shoulsnt be working for another week here until the medication is in full effect.",04Feb2020,1
5,what should i do? im alone over an hour away from anyone who knows me i cant drive and i cant afford to go to the hospital and idk what to do. i have so much anger and sadness built up rn and no way to release it. im struggling so much and just any advice that isnt ‚Äúu have so much to live for‚Äù or ‚Äúur not alone‚Äù would be much appreciated,04Feb2020,1
6,"This is a very new thing for me, and when it happens I have a hard time remembering details but I'll do my best to describe it.

I've been comparing this to some sort of panic attack, where I have pain in my chest, shortness of breath/hyperventilation, shaking, and just a general feeling of having no control over myself. Panic attacks aren't a new thing for me, as I've been struggling with anxiety for years. Lately though, these episodes will start like a panic attack, but the feeling is kind of different, very specific and hard to describe. I'll start having the attack, but I'll punch myself, the wall, or basically anything near or around me in the process, pretty hard to the point where I've bruised up my legs pretty good. Mostly it ends up being my legs or my arms, once or twice it was the wall. The first time it happened (about 3 days ago) it really freaked me out because I've never done anything like this before. It continued to happen several times a day and is still consistently happening. My boyfriend was with me for the first 2 days it happened, and he ended up having to pin me down or hold my hands behind my back to keep me from punching myself. 

Today was the first day that it happened without my boyfriend there, and it was significantly harder to control. I can sort of tell when it's going to happen because that very specific feeling comes on pretty fast. From there I'll sort of just sit there and focus super hard on tensing different muscles to distract myself from wanting to punch myself. It hasn't been working very well and both times I left more bruises. After it's over I feel like I just ran a few miles, it's very exhausting

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced something like this? My guess is it's probably stemming from some anger I have built up over some things that have happened in the last few weeks. I've had pretty bad depression for a few years now, and it's been especially worse lately due to my cousin and 2 of my friends passing away in the span of 3 months. I've been wanting to tell my roommate, but I'm scared she'll think I'm crazy or tell someone who would end up getting me admitted. 

It's hard to convince myself that I'm not crazy or losing my mind. I've been trying to get in with my old therapist (the only therapist that has ever actually helped me) but I'm not able to get in until April. If anyone on here knows some good techniques to control something like this or why this might be happening all of a sudden I am all ears.",04Feb2020,1

Heres some shit u can read. (u don't have to read this. TRIGGER WARNING)

 I sold myself, prostituted myself for about a year, and tortured myself while people tortured me 24/7 everyday. Msybe got raped 50 times a day. Tortured 200 times a day and i was there bitch. They didnt even pay me. Watch out and be careful hun I walked into Angela/Andrea and Jimmy Millers house, the 2nd out of the 3 foster homes i waz in, there was a 9 year old kid getting abused, like how they tied me to a tree and tortured me. They tourtured me so much on a 24/7 daily bases, worse than my bio dad. The 9 year olds name was Anthony Castillo-Martinez, he was autistic and had PTSD and ADHD, self harm, anger and suicidal issues. I got tortured for him, whenever Angela tried to torture him, i got in the way, any kind of abuse and torture and traumatic thing that coulda happened to me. It did. Finally i got a day pass out of the house. I got arrested and started doing criminal things, insane and dangerous things, i was walking on the side of the freeway, i came back, and i saw Angela and Jimmy fighting, Jimmy was tired of Angela torturing me and the other kids, Anthony was outside tied to the tree. I untied him and i stole him, i ran to LA, taking buses and trains, i found a motel, i tried to convince them to let us in, cuz i was technically homeless -again- they let us stay for 3 nights, I called up Kimberly, and she met us over there, Kimberly started torturing me worse and before. She set me up in the sex trade, i had 40 to 70 people a day, guys and girls, torture, abuse, rape, beat, drug me up. For money for us to live and take care of Anthony, she was the RingLeader, per say. I took care of Anthony as my own, Kimberly did absolutely nothing, nothing at all. She paid everyone to torture me,
i was a drug addict and alcoholic. Hardcore, and the more i was high and loaded, the less i felt, at this point in time, I didnt know that Kimberly was the head of all this, one of the guys who continuously tortured me, was trying to go after Anthony, and i stepped in front of him and took the torture, Anthony kept asking me if i was his real mom, i couldnt answer that question. I cried everynight. Jeremy Carlos Baraz came in and started yelling at Kimberly, i was curious, but as soon as i walked in, Jeremy had a gun up to her head, Kimberly told Jeremy to ""Go Shoot Izzy, i have nothing u want, she has meth and cocaine"", Jeremy told me to go to my room, when he left will all my drugs, Kimberly stormed into my room, i was sleeping on my floor like usual, so Anthony had a place to sleep. Kim told me that it was my fault, and ""i coulda got killed, and its all your fault"" she called some of her ""friends"" to come ""handle some business"" about 10 people came in, and they came in my room, and they started literally torturing me. They tied me to the bed, about 20 + more people came in, and they drugged me up, they beat me, tortured me jn every way possible, (later i found out that they filmed it, and it was Kimberlys idea) they raped me, but i was so used to it that i couldn't feel anything. I tried to scream, so they ducktaped my mouth, they said ""you speak, you die"" the more i resisted,

I tried to scream, so they ducktaped my mouth, they said ""you speak, you die"" the more i resisted,. the more i got tortured. They put a gun to my head, 4 people had a gun each, and two guns were pointed towards each side of my head. It came a daily thing, for weeks, my mom didnt know about anything, she still thought i was at the foster home i ran away from. Each day more and more people came. On the weekends i had more time with Anthony, but i took care of him as my own. Kimberly did shit. I almost died multiple times. But it was my job to protect and provide for Anthony. Kimberly was still my girlfriend, we were engaged. And if i left, all hell would break loose. So i stayed, stupid me. 

_________ **The kids in Angela/Andrea &amp;&amp; Jimmys Home; 

__Englasias ""Enji"" Moreno-Miller: Enji is a hard core drug addict and alcoholic. He got diagnosed with Bipolar, Anxiety and PTSD, hes Angela/Andrea and Jimmy Millers foster-son, Hes 20 years old, he sneaks drugs in the house. Andrea/Angela Miller still abuses him, doesnt matter if hes her son or not. Mainly cuz hes bisexual. They had a custody battle to who gets to mske Enji's life decisions. Jimmy hates when Andrea/Angela abuses Enji. *The Meaning Behind ""Enji"": Enji was a name i made up for him, because he hates the name Englasias cuz its what Andrea/Angela calls him when she abuses him. So i made up a nick name for him 

__Giovanni ""Gio"" Santiago: Giovanni is a 22 year old male. He got put into foster care, when he was 9, Angela/Andrea torturex him obsessivly. In all ways, but Jimmy payz her to do it. Gio has Schizophrenia, Anxiety. pTsd, depression, anorexia, borderline personality, and paranoid physcosis. Angela/Andrea tortures him for no reason, Gio is the oldest of all the people in the house, i usually step in and take the torture for Gio, me and Gio dated for 2 months, then broke up cuz of Andrea/Angelas stupid rules. I protect Gio, were really close, Jimmy abuses him sexually physically by mentally. *The Meaning Behind ""Gio"": Gio is the name i gave him, also know as Gizmo, when he and i were playing ""foster home"" even tho we were already in one lol. Gio Gio Giovanni, we were goofballs, rebels, and sassy queens. We had a lot of fun and were always there to eachother nonstop, and helped eachother, we became to close. Wayyy to close. Love u Gio Gio 
Giovanni. 

__Nancy ""Andrew"" Augustine: Nancy is a 15 year old trasngender female to male. So his pronouns are ""he/him/his"", he went into foster care a year after he was born, he got put into an orphanage. At the age of 2, Nancy was his birth name. And he hasnt gotten it legally changed so Angela/Andrea calls him a ""her"" and he hates it. Angela/Andrea rapes him, drugs him, force feeds him, and physically abuses him. I call him Andrew, and he told me its his ""preferred name"" he likes to sing and write. Me and him have sing offs, and we write songs stories and poems together. *The Meaning Behind ""Andrew"": Susan Augustine was born a female but then transitioned to male, Susan hated her name, but whenever Angela/Andrea kept abusing and torturing her, and kept using ""her/she/hers"" it triggered Andrew. So i asked ""which name do u preferr, Andrew or Susan"" i made him feel welcome and was always there for him, and i wanted to help him to the end, noatter the circumstances, i overhelped him. And i helped him get started with SSI, Mental Health Stuff, and getting a name change. And taking the torture from him and i took it for and instead of him. Andrea/Angela, hated me for it. But i did it anyways. Love u Andrew, he attempted suicide, overdosed on his meds, i found him and called 911, and he was rushd to the ER, he never came home after that. I miss u. :( 

__Monica ""Monee"" Palmer: Monica is a 18 year old female, she was a rebel, she was my best friend, and i helped and was there 4 her obsessivly. Jimmy raped her several times. Andrea beat and tortured her to death, and i hit Andrea over the head with a frying pan and i beat her and attempted to slice her throat, i took the torture for Monica, Ive never seen Jimmy that fuxked up before, he was on PCP, and so was i. Me and Andrea got into an altercation, it involved alcohol, PCP, a gun, glass, and a knife. Me and Andrea/Angela went at it. Jimmy recorded it, and i told everyone to get out of the house. Me and Andrea/Angela went one on one for hours. I pointed the gun towards her, and Monica saw, she was crying. I threw Andrea/Angela out a glass window, after she tortured me extra bad and she taped my mouth shut, she raped abused, tortured, drugged. Burned and almost killed me. Jimmy ran out of the house after i threw Andrea/Angela out the glass window. They never had a license to run a foster home. Monica hugged me and Jimmy was crying, bur not for his wife. For me and everything he did to me, and To Monica. *The Meaning Behind ""Monee"": Monee, is short for Monique, which is a name that her grandma gave her, Monica always kept that name, even after her grandma passed away, Monica grew up without parents, and was sent to live with her.
grandma. After she passed Monica moved in to Jimmy and Angela/Andrea Millers house, and shes been trying to escape, she attempted a lot, but was always brought back to there house.

 __Anthony ""Lil'Toni"" Castillo-Martinez (My Unbio Son, Who Got Taken From Me, I Risked My Life To Raise Him, I Raised Him As My Own) i met Anthony Castillo when he was 9, none of us knew who his real parents are, but i took him in as my own, i risked my life to take care and provide for him, i did all i could possibly do to help and care and be there to him, he was autistic and had PTSD and ADHD, self harm, anger and suicidal issues. I got tortured for him, whenever Angela tried to torture him, i got in the way, any kind of abuse and torture and traumatic thing that coulda happened to me. It did, whether i wanted it to or not, Anthony tried to kill himself after he couldn't find out who his real parents were, I found out Anthony used to live with his aunt and uncle, Sarah and George Castillo, they both gave him up to his previous foster mom, Cherri Martinez, cuz he was ""to hard to handle"", (i figured out that his favorite color was pink, and he loved teddy bears, i still have the pink teddy bear i bought when i was homeless for the 13th time, in memory of my time with Anthony) Cherri had mental health issues, and whenever she had blown out physical violent fights with her ex-husband, who lost custody over Anthony, Jose Martinez, Anthony would hide and try to leave, but Cherri was to attached to him, she wouldn't let him leave at all, i later found out that Sarah and George Castillo abused him so bad. And then gave him away, to Cherri Martinez, but to this day i never knew who his real parents are, i got tortured abused raped in all ways, and drugged and prostituted and almost killed so i had money to care, provide. Support, be there and help Anthony, we lived in a run down motel, i illegally stole Anthony from his 2nd foster home. Angela/Andrea and Jimmy Miller's house, after i left, 

 i came back to save him, he saw me getting tortured, i took care of him obsessivly, i raised him, and he called me ""mommy"" and i lost him after a car accident, with me, Kimberly, and Anthony, after it was over, they found drugs in a back seat, and it was me, him and Kimberly in a back seat. But i never gave him drugs, Kimberly and i had a custody battle. And she won, after she accused me of giving him drugs, and CPS took him away, i was broken up, Ricky, the drunk driver, got charged after they found out he was the driver in the car accident, Jeremy Carlos Baraz, who already had a home, after i intervened into his shooting scene, where i violated my probation, (one of my abusive torturers) knew about the whole Kimberly calling CPS, was a part of getting Anthony taken away, and abusing me situation, i confronted him about it, and i got violent towards him, after Kimberly killed herself in front of me, Jeremy admitted he was a part of taking away Anthony for the money cuz he ""had to survive"", he called the cops on me, I was on cacaine, meth, alcohol, Ativan, And other drugs, i almost died ""according to the doctors at the hospital"", and Jeremy called the cops and later told me what happened, and instead of me violating my probation i got sent to the mental hospital, (which im known for acting out, getting in restraints, and getting the ""bootyjuice"" shot); Anthony is now 14 years old, i cant tell u his birthday cuz it waz something he told me to never give out, i hope hes in a good home,

*The Meaning Behind ""Lil'Toni"": some nicknames i gave him were ""AngelEyezx"" ""Lil Bon Bon"" ""Lil'Toni"" ""Antonio"" ""Mooshi Mooshi"" ""Pain In The Ass"" ""Birdie'"" ""Soldier"" ""Lil One"" ""BroSkiiSkii"" ""MnM"" ""Child"" ""Lovebug"" ""Curious George"" ""Momo"" ""Anto"" ""A-Skii"" ""Ace"" ""Annnnnthony"" ""Smart One"" ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" ""Mamas Boy "" ""My Son"" ""Jay Jay"" ""Trouble Maker Jr"" ""Izzys Angel"" ""Lil Angel"" ""My Love"" ""My Sweetheart"" ""Mister"" ""Beautiful"" ""Lassie"" ""Strong One"" ""Smartass"",
*AngelEyezx: this nickname was made up by both of us, he had green eyes and i had a similar color and we would always compliment each other on our eye color, we were like twins, he said i was his angel, and i said he was mine, so we came up with this nick name.
*Lil Bon Bon: Anthony was short, well no shit. He was nine, and he loved cinamon rolls, he would always ask me to buy them, it was his favorite food. Even when i didnt have enough money to buy them, he knew what went on in that motel, he called it a motel, but it waz really a run down low star hotel, Anthony wasnt naive about what happened to me nearly everyday. But i called him that cuz he loved cinamon rolls. 
*Lil' Toni: waz one of the 1st nicknames i gave him, because i still consider him my little boy, even if he waz only 9 at the time.
*Antonio: He would have pillow fights with me, while listening to music. He came up with the name Antonio when we would roleplay in the pillow fights. 

*Lil' One: i would always call him that cuz he was my Lil One.
*BroSkiiSkii: i forgot how this one came about.
*MnM: he loved MnMs so i called him MnM

*Lovebug: i just called him this, cuz i thought it was cute.

*MoMo: MoMo was also a nickname that i just came up with.
*Anto: a nickname he came up with, he never told me what it meant tho.
*A-Skii: A, short for Anthony, well thats obvious, but i mixed it with BroSkii, to A-Skii.
*Ace: i always think that the Ace and The Joker are the most important cards in the deck, so i called him Ace, cuz he was the most important thing to me.
*Annnnnthony: i loved to joke around with him and make funny voices and stories and i always extended his name, when i was in a joking mood.
*Smart One: i used sarcasm a lot, and when he would smart off to me or Kimberly, i would always say ""hold on smart one"" i would laugh, he mostly smarted off to Kimberly and she wouldn't like it, i was overprotective over him and would literally do anything for him, so i would get hurt instead but him, Anthony never liked Kimberly, i think nobody did either. And it was obvious why.
*Sweet Child O Mine: he loved Guns N' Roses, and whenever we would sing that we would dedicate it to eachother.
*Mamas Boy: Anthony was a Mamas Boy, so that name was obvious.

*My Son: hes my son, but he would never leave my side, instead of me saying ""thats my boy"" i would say ""thats my son"" i was proud of him all of time, and i was proud to be his mom, not by blood, but by heart.
*Jay Jay: tbh i forgot how i came up with that one.
*Trouble Maker Jr: i was the original trouble maker, he would try to take after me. But i wouldn't.
*Izzys Angel: like Charlies Angels, i named him Izzys Angel, cuz hes my angel, duh. Lol.
*Lil Angel: hes my angel. Period.
*My Love: hes my love to infinity and beyond.
*My Sweetheart: hes my sweetheart, and always will be.
*Mister: ""what are u doing mister"" i always said that.
*Beautiful: he has a beautiful soul and heart.
*Lassie: he loved dogs, and anything that had to with dogs.
*Strong One: hes extremely strong. In every which way possible.
*Smartass: he would be smart to Kimberly or me, and i would say ""ok Smartass"".
But Lil Toni was my favourite one to call him.

*The Meaning Behind ""Tyler"": Tyler X or ""Ace X"" or ""XX"" Fiaskko-Alvaro, is one of my main alters. I have many alters and i live among many alternate universes. Mainly NXSP, or Not Xactly Secure Program, is where my mind is mainly centered, when i was 9 years old, i sae a man, or a shadow, with a knife, on my bed, when i was living in Fernbank, and he told me to look him in the eyes, and i did, and thats when he became my master, and he tortured me, i shoulda never looked him in the eyes, or i probably wouldn't have had the many mental illnesses u have now. But i ""raised hell"" as Liz Ramos, who i claimed was my name, especially when i went to ETS mental hospital when i was 12, i told them my name wasn't Sara (Sara is my legal name) that it was Liz. And i go by Izzy now, i took the last name Martinez, from Anthony. Even if its not my real last name. Tyler was my second alter, also being mind abused by Johnny ""JJ"" Garcia.

**About Angela/Andrea and Jimmy; 

[Angela/Andrea Miller]; Angela/Andrea Miller was born in prison, and almost aborted. Her parents were a religious couple, and her brother, Delacruz, would torture her behind their parents back, one day Angela hit her head against a brick wall, she woke up with no memory of anything, and couldnt remember her name, at all, she got diagnosed with ""Multiple Personality Disorder"" and became abusive and extremely torturous, she met Jimmy at a frat party, and they started doing drugs together, but Jimmy had no idea about her torturous side. She ""switched"" a lot, kinda the same situation as Dr J. And Mr Hide, but her good personality faded and Angela and Andrea became one personality. The extremely torturous personality. 

[Jimmy Miller]; Jimmy was always abusive, but never as abusive and his wife, Angela/Andrea Miller. Jimmys biological kids got put into foster care after being taken away by CPS, Jimmy grew up in an abusive single parent household, he was a wife beater and abused his kids. His dad was never around and his mom was addicted to crack cocaine and alcohol. Jimmy was a bully at school when he was in high school. Jimmy met Angela/Andrea Miller at a frat party. And they clicked as soon as they met, but still he had no idea about the ""real side"" of her, Jimmy offered to run a group home, which later lead to the foster home, but they never had a license to be foster parents, they took in Enji first, and thats how everything started. How i know this? I observed a lot. 

**About Anthony; Anthony is a 14 year old male. Who is my unbiological son, i bent over backwards for him, He got taken away after Kimberly Marie Olivarez, who is my deceased ex fiance, and Jeremy Carlos Baraz, who is my deceased ex friend. Both of them made a false accusation that i gave him drugs, which is false. And CPS took him away, he was 9 at the time, now hes 14. Hes turning 15 soon, and i miss him everyday. I raised him as my own. We never figured out who his real parents are. But he lived with his aunt and uncle Sarah and George Castillo, then with a foster family, With Cherri and Jose Martinez, then with Angela/Andrea and Jimmy Miller, where we were previously living, i left than came back for Anthony. I havnt seen him for years and idk where he is, i did my best to be a mother. And to take care of him, no Matter the circumstances. 

**My 4 Different Experiences W/ Anorexia; 
1st Time: 2012; Weight: 77lb. 
I would starve myself till i passed out, i would obsess over calories, including refusing to drink water, i would excersise to the point of passing out, they rushed me to the ER, and i got fed through a feeding tube, i weighed down to 77lb and still thought i was fat, my bones were showing, i couldnt function, longest without food was 10 days, i drank ensure and made myself throw it up. I went into treatment for Anorexia Nervosa, my mom still isnt aware to this day. 

2nd Time: 2015; Weight: 84lb. 
All i ate were saltine crackers, and i would starve myself up to 8 to 9 days, while in the process of doing that, i was in treatment, remember i didnt have a home from 2011 to 2018. So nobody was aware, i went down to skin and bone. I was homeless and bouncing from mental hospital, to treatment centers (unlocked/locked/involuntary/voluntary/short term/long term) the streets. And to rehabs, foster homes, group homes etc etc. I weighed myself everyday. People got concerned, and they admitted me to a mental hospital after i was on the side of the highway, and i kept blacking out, i was on a lot of drugs at that time. Meth mainly, and alcohol. I got taken to a mental hospital, and i couldn't leave till my tray was finished. And i had a 1:1 staff with me at all times to monitor my food intake, but i got past them, i didn't eat for a week, and they gave me the feeding tube again, and i had a huge hatred towards food. 

3rd Time: 2017; Weight 98lb.
I was in and out of placements and i starved myself for 6 days, then on the 7th i made it look like I ate. With my own methods. I was extremely insecure, and my mental illnesses got worse, people said i was skinny, but even at 98lb i still thought I was fat. I was sent to a treatment centre for eating disorders, and i still refused to eat, and i checked myself out. And then regretted it later. 

4th Time: 2019; Weight: Under 130lb.??
Its been since late March or early April. And is still active at this time, i basically hate food. Its been months new, and my weight has been rapidly decreasing, i starve myself from 4 to 6 days, and on the 6th day i eat something small.  Then i secretly throw it up, im not at an unhealthy weight, i exercise obsessivly and obsess over calories, i look in the mirror and i look fat, but everyone else saying that im Skinny, after the 5 to 6 days with no food, on day 7 i eat something small, then starve myself again, im blacking out more, and my mom wants me to go to  treatment, i hate food with a burning passion, and im taking diet pills, but im over 1 year clean from all drugs and alcohol, im obsessed with losing weight   and even after i lose to much. Its never low enough. 
üî•ü¶ãü•ÄThis Is My 4th Time Struggling With Anorexia Nervosa. Ive been starving myself for so long now, that its become so easy to just skip days with no food. Food is my enemy &amp; i hate food ' all food with a passion. Ive seeked treatment several times, ive gotten a feeding tube, and almost died several times. I count the calories and literally EVERYTHING. I excercise obsessivly. While i look in the mirror and see how fat i look, everyone else says i ""look sick"" and im ""skinnier then i realize""

9,"My mom is 68 years old and she‚Äôs had schizophrenia for pretty much her whole life.  She won‚Äôt take her meds.  She thinks she‚Äôs allergic to them.

This morning she texted me and asked me to come over and fix her house because it‚Äôs saying mean things to her.   I drove right over, and as far as I can tell she‚Äôs having a lot of auditory hallucinations.  She was watching music videos and kept asking me why they sounded so weird and why the people in the videos kept threatening her and telling her to get out of the house.  Also she said that when she opened her kitchen cabinets she could hear people having sex inside of them, and also that someone was using her computer to make child porn, somehow.  She didn‚Äôt want to go in her bedroom because the walls there were telling her ‚Äúthis is my house, you have to get out‚Äù or something like that.

I called the clinic where she sees a psychiatrist.  I spoke to a social worker there, who told me my mom missed her appointment last week.  She tried to talk to my mom on the phone but my mom wouldn‚Äôt talk to her.  I offered to bring my mom to the doctor to get her some medicine and she said no thanks.  She doesn‚Äôt think she‚Äôs psychotic, she thinks it‚Äôs a problem with her house or someone hacked her Netflix or something.  She said she was allergic to antipsychotic drugs.  I felt like there was nothing I could really do because she didn‚Äôt want to go to the doctor, didn‚Äôt want to take meds, and I can‚Äôt force her to.

Do any of you have any suggestions that could help?  I feel like the only option is waiting until it gets so bad that she‚Äôs completely incoherent and then having her involuntarily committed, but I know that‚Äôs not good for her.  I‚Äôd like to get her treatment ASAP but I can‚Äôt get her to agree to it.",04Feb2020,1
10,"I feel like ive posted here before, but I think it's just some type of false deja vu.

I can't seem to get stuff off my chest when I need to, yet I get emotional when i'm alone in my own world. I face alot on the daily, from chronic asthma pains and clinical anxiety to taking AP classes in 8th grade, yes, 8th. I want to talk to a friend about my issues, but none of em are willing to listen, and the ones that are willing to help are out of my state, and can't really do much either. 

If I were to actually explain it to somebody, they'll hit me with ""MAN UP"", or something simular, and I can't stand it. I mess up on almost everything, and im a socially awkward person. People get mad at me over Catch 22s that I cant even tell them about, and its like I have to take responsibility over things that have NOTHING to do with me, which is why I hide my pains and issues from people. I'm literally screaming my lungs out and killing my brain cells because of my rage.

I usually play Dauntless and watch YouTube/Posts on Instagram/Reddit as a coping mechanism, because I can't really do anything else. I don't really have a life outside of a 24/7 online Coordinate Algebra course that's skuffed and being the oldest out of 4 children who consistently mess up and do things that trigger really bad thoughts, and actions that I don't intend on doing/thinking.

I decided to make QuickNotes on my phone to help me actually list the things going wrong and stuff, and i'm afraid to tell anybody because then I feel like i'm overexaggerating and being a faker about myself... I can conclude that nobody understands me and if I were to actually explain myself in a way where people could understand, they would literally shit on me.

Of course, i'm an intelligent person, but i'm also very slow in the head thanks to stress and anxiety. I can't do much in conversations without screwing the whole thing up and making the chat go dead, or screwing up IRL and having everyone doubt me. I'm very sensitive, and I remember things that hurt and zone out alot because of memories like those of which hurts.

Everyone always thinks im a cool chill person, when on the inside I feel as if my reactor core is overheating and is about to cause a major radiation overload... I have to hold in anger and intrusive thoughts of suicide/homocide, or urges to try and harm myself everyday, and I just want it to stop... I suffer PTSD from past events and my abusive father who is now on a restraining order for his craziness... 

Everyone keeps saying I need a therapist, but it's not that easy, if literally everyone who I can ask for help just doubts me and wont listen. I just want someone to give advice, or at least suggest some things to help. I'm not even trying to be a karma whore, or whatever, its not even funny. Really. I honestly don't even think anyone would understand...",04Feb2020,1
11,"Over the past few days I've started hearing what seemed like noises or murmurs but now I can hear the odd word or sentence, and get so engrossed in listening to these noises I wont notice time going I think my mum can read my thoughts and I'm pretty sure she knows I know about it, but she wont say anything.",04Feb2020,1
12,My sister is being bullied/harassed by her roommates for having mental health issues. they want her to leave the apartment but she‚Äôs been living there the longest and had them move in after her. They make her pay more for the room and scream at her for not doing dishes. I want to take action. Does anyone know any good articles or anything I can do for her ? She got so drunk the other night because her friends/roommates are being so evil to her and two guys followed her home and raped her.  I‚Äôm extremely distraught and just want to help her.,04Feb2020,1
13,I've recently been experiencing anxiety and depression that seems to be double what it usually is. I'm normally able to cope without meds but I have scheduled a doctor's visit tomorrow and I'm scared. I've started having these horrible thoughts that terrify me and I'm afraid one day O might act on those thoughts. Any body else experience something like this? I'm terrified of the night now because that's when the thoughts are the worst. I don't know if I'm crazy or it's normal. I've read that it happens to a lot of people but what if I'm in the margin that act on those thoughts? What do I say to my doctor? And I'm so scared the doc will give me meds that amplify all of these thoughts and make my depression and anxiety worse. Can someone help? Any tips appreciated.,04Feb2020,1
14,"I‚Äôve been diagnosed with depression, ocd, selective mutism, and general anxiety since I was 12. I‚Äôve been to so many therapists and have been on so many medications to no avail. My dad tries to help it‚Äôs just there‚Äôs nothing that he can really do.

I dropped out halfway through freshman year because I kept getting panic attacks and just stopped going. I‚Äôm a sophomore now and I just started this homeschool program last week and it‚Äôs so stressful I can‚Äôt even get all my work done every day. I‚Äôve tried 2 other programs before this so i‚Äôll have to stick with it. It‚Äôs not even possible to do the amount of work they‚Äôre asking.

Well anyways i‚Äôm always telling my dad how I hate him and flipping him off. It‚Äôs a reflex or a habit at this point. It‚Äôs fucked up but it‚Äôs the only thing that calms my stress a bit. I know it‚Äôs horrible but it‚Äôs the only thing i‚Äôve tried that works. I really should kill myself I don‚Äôt deserve to be alive. He‚Äôs all I have other than my brother, I have no friends. Me and my brother get along just fine though. 

He just went off on me and now i‚Äôm in my room crying. He should‚Äôve gone off on me. It‚Äôs really making the suicidal thoughts worse. 

There‚Äôs not an hour that goes by where I don‚Äôt think of suicide. I have dreams about it but not good dreams. But i‚Äôm too scared to do it, i‚Äôm too scared to even self harm. 

Nothing brings me joy. And even the things that do like watching a movie I can‚Äôt do now because school is taking up all my time. 

I feel like I have something undiagnosed about me that‚Äôs making me so angry or maybe i‚Äôm just making excuses. I don‚Äôt feel mentally stable. I‚Äôm actually a bad person. And I don‚Äôt mean that in a ‚Äúmake me feel better‚Äù kind of way I just really am",04Feb2020,1
15,"for anyone who's been to a mental hospital i need advice....is it actually beneficial and is it as bad as people make it out to be?

16,"This feels really silly to say but I feel like I need to speak to a mental health professional and I‚Äôm not really sure what to say or where to start.  I know something has changed in my mental state but I have a very difficult time describing it. It‚Äôs like, I know something is wrong but I can‚Äôt quite nail down what the feeling is. I told a friend a while back that I need to make an appointment with a therapist but I haven‚Äôt taken any steps toward that so far. Then, I ran into her at a super bowl party yesterday and she asked me wether or not I had made that appointment yet. It really meant a lot that she remembered me saying that and cared enough to ask me about it. I really want to take the next step and talk to someone but I‚Äôm scared that I wont make any sense and they won‚Äôt be able to help me. Also, I‚Äôm active duty military and don‚Äôt want to speak to another military member. Maybe it‚Äôs just the stigma that comes with seeking help that I don‚Äôt want to be associated with.  Either way, I don‚Äôt know how to get help outside the military medicine system. Anyone got any stories of starting out with a psych and how they were helped or ideas about how to get started?

17,"So about 2 weeks ago my girlfriend K, moved out of her house and didn‚Äôt tell anyone. She lived with her family and they did not see this coming. She didn‚Äôt tell me, and just texted me she needed some distance. I later found out she actually moved out. I tried texting her but no reply. 


Fast forward to today, they find out she was living with a teacher at a trade school she attended. This is a trade school that offers medical certifications, like the PCT she had just completed. And for whatever reason, she decided to move in with her old teacher. Her progress had just ended in the middle of January I believe. 


Her best friend picked her up and helped move her out of the apartment she was staying at. I don‚Äôt know how they found out of how they got her to come along, they are hesitant to share all the information. But she is currently under the care of her best friend.


Her friend is saying she is acting crazy, laughing a lot then crying a lot and then being completely calm. She said she doesn‚Äôt want to talk to anybody and doesn‚Äôt care about anybody. She said she was going to meet me tomorrow but I never agreed to that and they think she is going to try and go back to the teachers apartment. 


The cops couldn‚Äôt do anything since she is an adult and she decided to move in. I‚Äôm going to assume they didn‚Äôt find drugs when they went because apparently the cops went to the apartment with the best friend. 


This is NOT normal behavior for her. She is usually a very calm, catholic girl. Very sweet and just calm. 


Could this teacher have some sort of psychological ‚Äòhold‚Äô over my girlfriend K?? What could cause someone to ditch all their personal feelings and emotions and want to ‚Äòhide away‚Äô with them? 


My first theory was maybe she has a relationship with the teacher. The teacher is a female, and is older like probably in 40s If I had to guess. K is a virgin, and I don‚Äôt think she had experienced any sexual encounter before so that‚Äôs what made me think something like that is happening. 


Any insight on mental breakdowns and episodes of psychosis would be much appreciated because I am trying to help but her family is hesistant to let me.",04Feb2020,1

20,"I'm sorry ahead of time if this paragraph is too large or just a jumble of thoughts. I've been doing anything to stop thinking, so if this post keeps bouncing from one thing to another I apologize. I'm 19, 20 in November. Last year in May, I graduated. And with graduation as many know, people go their separate ways. They tend to, anyway. Back then I was worried, as well. I've never been good at dealing with stuff alone. When I do, my mind races to think of all the worst outcomes first. School allowed me to talk to people that cared about me, though. They were there for me when I needed them, and I was there for them in return. I still remember teachers pulling the old PDA card out whenever one of my friends would hold onto me if I was going through stuff. That got me through so much. I wasn't left to my own thoughts. Since graduation, I've only seen my closest friend in person once. I know they have their own lives, and I'm proud of them. But, whenever problems occur in my life now, I don't know what to do. I know it's pathetic. Even if I have people texting me to let me vent, that thought of me talking to someone through a screen constantly pops up in my mind. And even if they're talking to me through the phone, I feel alone. I've made it through the year though, till recently. Last week, I found out that my closest friend took her own life. Since then, I've constantly been on the verge of a breakdown. And no matter who I contact, no one is available to meet so I can talk. I've had to deal with this alone and my brain keeps telling me that it would be so much easier to not have to deal with all of this. To be free of stress. Of life. Those thoughts have always been in the back of my head, hell, I'm sure everyone's had them at some point. But they're getting louder now. And I want to listen to them so bad. I don't know what to do.",04Feb2020,1

Seriously i am sick and tired of clowns degrading themselves in the forms of ''memes'', yes we get it, your head is an apocalypse disaster that will continue to not only get worse but be paramount to what you're dealing with now. This whole culture of romanticising mental illness is pathetic. These are the same people who feel offended when someone makes a remark about their illness, but will laugh at a meme about how disposable and ''disastrous'' they are. i have no issues with general memes like ''when you feel the need to do a compulsion'', but what i hate is those memes that paint you as some beautiful tragedy

Why are we normalising low self worth and low self esteem? we don't want a society where everybody is a ''Doomer'', and as an excuse is just ''depressed''.

22,"So my school is split into different friend groups. The ""cool"" people that do drugs, the ""Uncool"" people that do drugs, The good kids that don't do drugs, the bad kids that don't do drugs, and the outcasts. 

I started out in the bad kids that don't do drugs group, which did not associate with the ""cool"" people that do drugs. I was part of the group from all of middle school until a field trip in grade nine where I alienated one of my best friends and was basically kicked out of the group. 

For some reason though I managed to instantly gain a bit of traction in the cool kids that do drugs group and gained notoriety throughout grade 9 since me being on drugs was apparently funny. 

However grade 10 rolled around, and I realized I didn't have any true friends in that group. Nobody that actually cared about how you felt. I did so well in grade nine because I started off that year with the support of friends. But this new year I had nobody to help me settle in. If there wasn't one of the three people I could actually talk to in a class I could talk to nobody. And not talking to anybody for the first two periods of the day broke me for the rest of the day. Since I had so much energy from just sitting there doing nothing I became anxious, I got social anxiety something I had never experienced before. I started bringing alcohol to school. Ans the result were amazing. I had friends again, drunk me didn't care about friend groups or anything. I felt free to talk to everyone. Nobody was unworthy of my attention so I always had people to talk to. 

Skip to grade eleven I started off the year same as before, coming to school drunk every day. As awesome as before. My parents searched my room because I said I had lost my calculator and they didn't want to buy a new one and figured they could find it themselves. They found multiple empty bottles of wine. I was planning to dispose of them the following day. I don't know why I didn't. Without alcohol's help I was more broken than before. I didn't have the strength of drunk me anymore and I didn't have any drugs because I was broke. Which meant my position in the ""cool"" kids that do drugs group was not going to be possible anymore. I started coming to school and pretending to be high. I told everyone I was still getting drunk at home just that I wasn't doing it at school anymore. But my anxiety was building like a fountain about to overflow, I could barely speak. Some days I can barely even move my legs.

Today it's been 6 months since I've done any drug. I'm still pretending. Today was the worst I ever felt. I was shaking in my chair. It took every ounce of mental strength to get myself to sand up and walk out of the classroom. I nearly fell a few times walking to mcdonalds for lunch. The anxiety is killing me. How can a human body have this much adrenaline.",04Feb2020,1
23,"Hey Reddit, 
I have recently over the past year developed this horible mental state where I'll subconsciously start telling myself to kill myself or self harm. Ive also been waking up to large scratches on my wrist. They are definitely made by me in my sleep no question about it. I have no real connections left in terms of friends and I don't want to worry my family as they have caught me self harming before and I don't want to worry them as I remember how sad it made them feel. I don't trust anyone irl to tell them so here I am making some dumb post on the internet at 2am to give me hope. I can't go to a therapist I'm only 17 and don't make that kind of money. I've tried seeing my school counceler but he was off no help. I don't want to slave away for the rest of my life working some shitty 9-5 job.  I'm not talented enough to do any of the stuff I enjoy professionaly. So I know the rest of my life will be a misery with some office job I don't even want that I only do because it pays well. I don't really have anyone so I thought I'd vent to Reddit.

I haven't been able to hold a job for more than a year at a time before getting fired let go because it is only matter of time before my mental state decomposes and I turn into a confused, stressed, angry, person who feels helpless and either gives up or lashes out.

I'm just finding that my brain is fed up of being told to try things I've tried or quotes and thoughts that my depressed logic can easily tear apart. I still appreciate the effort they are going to to improve the world around them and increase the positivity. But even though I truly appreciate it I cant stop the gut feeling and emotions that rise instead. Everyone seems to be surprised when I dont react happily towards positivity posts or hopeful quotes and I am wondering if it's another thing to add to the extensive list of things that are wrong with me and make me abnormal or if for one of the first times I'm experiencing emotion normally for once and that normality is what's causing me to struggle.

28,"Hi all. I'm 19, and I know this is still young, but I feel such immense guilt for time I feel like I've wasted.  I was diagnosed with major depression and general anxiety when I was 12, and I've always been in a troubled family situation. I used to be so passionate, and I feel like I have so much wasted potential. I dropped all of my hobbies for quick pleasure (spending money, smoking weed, video games, SLEEP), I went from nearly straight A's in advanced classes to barely passing, I've had next to no social life and zero memories and accomplishments. I'm in a slightly more stable place in my life and I am looking to start seeking treatment and start ""becoming myself"" again by taking up hobbies, trying to be social, etc... but I feel so overwhelmed with guilt, shame and hopelessness over my past, that it's difficult to have the positive outlook I need.

29,"It's taken me the better part of 22 years to realise how badly I've been affected by growing up with an absent father and my mum who used me as a crutch for her own issues.

 I've always felt different to my friends, and have never understood a real family dynamic. 

 I am an only child from a family with a drug addicted mother (who I have been told has attempted suicide several times in my lifetime and I believe to have a myriad of mental health problems). This is something I've always been used to and tried to ignore, as I believe you can't help where you come from but you can help where you go.. My form of rebellion growing up was to do as well as possible in school and avoid all forms of drugs.

As I get older I feel my self-esteem dropping and am realising how bad my relationships with men are... I have severe abandonment issues and I'm equally terrified of being with someone as I am of being alone. I have come to realise over time that this is most likely related to my lack of male role model in my childhood and subsequent familial issues. 

I find it incredibly hard to confide in people as I grew up being used to caring for my mother's emotional well-being, being her confidante for as long as I can remember and dealing with her extreme mood swings. She is not a bad parent, just someone that has been through a lot and made a few wrong turns; However, I have been left completely scarred by how I was bought up and scared to talk to people about how I feel in case I am burdening them with the pain that I have felt for most of my life. 

I am constantly so scared and I have no idea how to fix my issues, I'm terrified I'm going to end up alone because of the walls I have built around me to stop myself from feeling any more hurt. Men I am romantic with constantly tell me I am cold and that I close up very quickly - this hurts even more because I know that I'm really nothing like how I project myself to others. 

The only man I have ever felt a complete trust in my life is my best friend who has cared for me endlessly over the last two years. This is a relationship that confuses me as I've never felt love from a man without it having sexual connotations, and the more I think about it the more I worry I'm going to mess up this friendship by inevitably falling in love with the one person that truly cares about me. 

TLDR: Is there anyone else here feeling lost? 

How do I fix my relationship and attitude toward men  / increase my self-esteem and stop being so scared to open up to people?",04Feb2020,1
30,"Hello. I (F16) have been experiencing a lot of mood swings and I just want to know if I could possibly be bipolar. 

Like I said, I've been having a lot of mood swings lately. In the beginning of December, I was extremely low and felt horrible everyday. (By then I haven't been to therapy for a week or two, and haven't been back since.) There wasn't really a real reason. To cope I c*t myself, and drank everyday. I reached out for help, and was told I felt bad because of that, my behavior. Which is probably true. However, I haven't been drinking regularly for over a week now and it's actually been great, except I still feel horrible. Sometimes I get very suddenly 'happy' and start getting so excited I feel the urge to cry, and then feel happy and sad at the same time in extreme. I don't know if this is 'normal' or sounds weird but it's been exhausting. 

A few days ago, I was having dinner with my family and my grandmother made a comment about something as little as me being on my phone and I completely lost it and went on this angry rant and shouted at her. I still feel really bad about it, I love her alot and would normally never do that but I completely lost control. 

In another instance, I was talking to a friend online and they said they were falling asleep. I was extremely happy, but then I just felt awful after they said it. He then eventually fell asleep which surprised me, and I just froze and started crying suddenly. I keep having these intense emotions over the smallest things. I'm sorry if this sounds stupid but I just really hate it and don't know what to do. 

I took some online tests and researched it, and found I have some symptoms but I'm still unsure, and wouldn't want to self diagnose but I'm just so exhausted and want to know what's going on. If it helps, my mother has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

I know it's much more than a few mood swings but I just feel horrible and put off by these sudden ups and downs.

I might just get a 'go see a therapist' but I'm just looking for honest opinions here, or some help. If you have a question I'll gladly answer. Thanks.",04Feb2020,1
31,"Cross posted in: r/depression_help (so far)

Hey, so my town has had a lot of tragedies lately. Including a teacher and a student in my class. My friend, let‚Äôs call her Oak, was relatively close to the student and was even on her way to where he was at when he died. She was also close to the teacher (as was I) and the teacher was the first adult she had ever told about her family. Oak‚Äôs family, mostly her father, is pretty bad. She swears he doesn‚Äôt hurt her, but I don‚Äôt know if I believe that. I know he hurts Oak‚Äôs mother. He drinks a lot too. That added on to all of this as well as her behavior the last couple weeks is really worrying me. She has a history of this type of thing, and I helped her get through it last time, but she isn‚Äôt talking to me. 

And other friends of hers are noticing too. One of them R, has also expressed a worry that Oak will hurt herself. Now that the kid in our class died a few days ago, (and Oak was bad before that), I am getting really worried. I have texted her to attempt to check up on her, you know, make sure she knows someone cares, but she hasn‚Äôt responded. I have asked R if they have talked to Oak, but I haven‚Äôt gotten a response either. 

How long until I should be really worried. Oak lives like 25 minutes away from me, which doesn‚Äôt seem like a lot, but it could be depending on the situation. Plus, I have parents that track me and would not approve of me driving over there, or even calling Oak‚Äôs parents, (which I think would be counterintuitive anyway). 

So, if I do take the risk, I need to know, in your opinion, how long until I should start panicking and calling...she‚Äôs my best friend, I don‚Äôt want to push her away, but I‚Äôll never forgive myself if she hurts herself and I didn‚Äôt even try to help her.  Please. Any advice at all would be very helpful",04Feb2020,1

this psychiatrist is really frustrating to be with though. she literally forces a parent to be there the entire session while she asks questions (including answering questions related to past/current abuse). even if you and your parent say they want you to be alone with her she doesnt allow it.
she also gets mad at me when i stim or dont look her in the eyes. shes really condescending and belittled me when i mentioned not doing well in school.

33,"So I‚Äôm a little bit confused about how to deal with her and get the most out of my partner... at this point I am not even sure if she has an illness because she refuses to get help, go to counselling, or psychotherapy....

I need help figuring out if this is anything i should be aware of...

These symptoms are very obvious and clearly noticeable when you get to know my gf properly:

1. She can‚Äôt think long term, abstractly, outside of the current moment. (For example, if I say something with a double meaning, she wouldn‚Äôt understand. She can‚Äôt understand standup comedy because the a lot of jokes are saying one thing but meaning something else entirely)

2. She is social on the surface but is incapable of forming deep human connection, even with me.

3. She can‚Äôt process emotions, be vulnerable and literally shuts down if you try to have an adult conversation about issues in our relationship. (I bring up a concern and how it makes me feel and its impact on her relationship and her response will be staring at me blank faced completely....she will never say anything nor ever bring it up later, so its as if im talking to a wall. When pressured to say something she visibly seems to have difficulty saying anything comforting or meaningful)

4. She can‚Äôt talk about any deep topics in life, nor focus on anything someone is saying for longer periods. She admits she may have intense adhd. She has never watched a movie at all, says she can‚Äôt focus on it...

5. She has to constantly be doing something non stop everyday. She can‚Äôt sit still and just relax or think about things.

6. She has literally can not comprehend much of the world and how it functions outside of her world. 

7. She says she has dyslexia but im not sure what that means in the real world...

8. Emotionally it seems she is stuck as a child and never grew up. 

9. She was raped when she was 6 and her parents weren‚Äôt around that much during her younger years.

I am confused about what to do. Many of her behaviour seems like relationship red flags to me and i often get very anxious and want to leave her. But then on the other hand she seems like there is something mentally wrong with her and I need to understand it a bit.

She doesn‚Äôt address my needs, doesnt flirt, doesn‚Äôt really know much of anything and i have to literally spell out and guide her in the relationship mostly to no avail. Socially and emotionally she seems ‚Äòheld back‚Äô.
On the surface, she seems super social, but ive come to realize its all super ficial....

She is very physical, likes physical activities and focuses more on sex than emotional connection....she actually cannot see what my concerns are...

I am confused and not sure what to do or think. She seemed completely normal.",04Feb2020,1

43,"One of the strongest predictors of success in mental health counseling is the Therapeutic Alliance which includes three aspects: 

Agreed upon Goals

Agreed upon Tasks

Warm/Caring Relationship

Students and mental health workers often focus most on the importance of the Relationship, saying that before they can do the work of mental health counseling, they first need to build a relationship. This would be an example of a ‚Äústep-wise‚Äù process. Think of a flight of stairs where we usually take one step at a time ‚Äì Step 1 comes first, then Step 2, then Step 3. 

The idea that the relationship must be built prior to doing the work of mental health counseling strikes me as inconsistent on two levels. 

First, research shows that the relationship alone is not a great predictor of success. 

Second, having practiced mental health therapy since 1993 - I have no idea how a step-wise process would even unfold. Would I sit and gaze in the client‚Äôs eyes and bond? Review their family photo albums? Go to a bar with them? Play checkers? Any idea I can muster developing a relationship FIRST and then WORKING seem inefficient and creepy ‚Äì probably leading me to lose my license! 

motivational interviewing, motivational interviewing training

&amp;#x200B;

The work of therapy happens in a PARALLEL not STEP-WISE process. As we help clients clarify their goals and identify credible plans, the relationship strengthens. And, as the relationship improves clients trust more and share more, allowing for further clarification of goals and development of credible plans. The process is like a feedback loop that happens in a parallel fashion. 

Life is also like this. I tend to disagree, for example, that we cannot get into a relationship until we are healed. Or, we cannot fill others buckets until our bucket is full. It is with people, that we learn to heal ourselves ‚Äì not in isolation (of course, not all people are worthy of our trust and not all people can help us heal ourselves). Further, we fill our bucket by filling other people‚Äôs buckets. The idea that relationships develop in a parallel with meeting needs is encouraging because we can immediately do things that help other people. We don‚Äôt have to wait on the sideline.

Is it possible to study major depressive disorder, a uniquely human mental-health
disorder, using knowledge gleaned from experiments in rats and mice? This is a hotly
debated topic by scientists and non-scientists alike. In this episode, recent
Neuroscience PhD graduate, Dr. Stephen Daniels, joins us to speak about his recently
published manuscript that addresses these controversial concepts, entitled ""Reverse
Translation of Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms: A Framework for the Behavioural
Phenotyping of Putative Biomarkers"", published in The Journal of Affective Disorders
[2020 Feb; 263(15): 353-366] / DOI: 10.1016/j.jad.2019.11.108.

Highlights

‚Ä¢ Reverse translation of biomarkers of depression.

‚Ä¢ Basic bio-behavioural functions in humans and animals.

‚Ä¢ Battery of tests in animals to study clinical biomarkers.

Abstract

Background
Reverse translating putative biomarkers of depression from patients to animals is
complex because Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly heterogenous condition. This review proposes an approach to reverse translation based on relating relevant
bio-behavioural functions in laboratory rodents to MDD symptoms.

Methods
This systematic review outlines symptom clusters assessed by psychometric tests of
MDD and antidepressant treatment response including the Montgomery‚Äì√Ösberg
Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the Beck
Depression Inventory. Symptoms were related to relevant behavioural assays in
laboratory rodents.

Results
The resulting battery of tests includes passive coping, anxiety-like behaviours, sleep,
caloric intake, cognition, psychomotor functions, hedonic reactivity and aversive
learning. These assays are discussed alongside relevant clinical symptoms of MDD, providing a framework through which reverse translation of a biomarker can be
interpreted.

Limitations
Certain aspects of MDD may not be quantified by tests in laboratory rodents, and their biological significance may not always be of clinical relevance.

Conclusions
Using this reverse translation approach, it is possible to clarify the functional significance of a putative biomarker in rodents and hence translate its contribution to specific clinical symptoms, or clusters of symptoms.

58,"I struggled immensely in 2019. 
That isn‚Äôt to say that my life was easy beforehand, but I *was* resilient. 
I was the type of person who could trudge through hell and back, turn my emotions on and off. I genuinely believed that depression was something I had control over. Anxiety was something I had control over. Panic attacks could be avoided and I could keep everything under control so long as I tried hard enough. I squirmed at the idea of my friends taking anti depressants. I gave tough-love advice. I thought that working 110 hours a week meant I was conquering my sadness. I thought chasing after men who would clearly never loved me would eventually bring me happiness. At least I never thought money could make me happy. And going into 2019 I was making a lot of it ‚Äì more than I knew what to do with. The more I had the less I wanted it. 
My first payment towards my student loans I paid it off in full. The next month I paid off 3 years worth of credit card debt. The same month I bought a new (used) car so I could travel with my work gear. 
After that everything I made went to paying it forward. The thing was, I knew I wasn‚Äôt very good, but I couldn‚Äôt help but believe the things I believed. So the only way I could sleep at night was to give everything I had to the people around me. Thousands of dollars to get my friends on their feet. We had all just graduated college. Thousands on Christmas for my family. I would buy everyone in the office breakfast every morning and once a week I would walk downtown and talk to the men sleeping on the streets that night and go buy them warm food. I thought if I continued to do this everything would balance out. I wouldn‚Äôt be so sad anymore if everyone around me was happy. 
To this day I don‚Äôt regret it ‚Äì but it didn‚Äôt work out the way I thought it would. 

In March of 2019 I lost my grandma ‚Äì my best friend. Five years prior to that I‚Äôd lost my mom, her daughter. Those two were my world. 

I figured because I saw it coming and got to say goodbye, however short, it would be easier this time around. I have never been so wrong. 

It took a few weeks to chip away at me bit by bit but eventually it broke me, and for the first time in my life I stayed broken. I couldn‚Äôt for the life of me get myself back on my feet. My ability to **control** slipped right through my fingers and the more I tried to grasp at it the more fleeting it became. 
It started to take things from me. My work, my concentration, my time, my money, my motivation. 
My depression became *Depression* , anxiety became *Anxiety* , panic became *Panic* . 
I lost all control. I was bound and confined by unexplainable urges and emotions, completely and totally. I would sleep on the floor and in the closet. I would think of a hundred ways to die. Eventually the only thing that got me out of bed in the morning was the promise to myself that if I got out of bed I could go find a way to kill my self. 
I got a puppy instead. 
And it worked. I still had 8 diagnoses brooding over me, but I couldn‚Äôt kill my self. I wanted to just the same, but who would feed him in the morning? 
It hasn‚Äôt even been a year since things got bad, but it feels like a lifetime. 
Everything I thought I knew has been balled up and dunked in the trash. I understand more now that I‚Äôve felt it myself. 
I‚Äôm unemployed now. The stress of my workplace just broke my brain one day. All of the medical and mental health professionals I see want me to consider disability. It isn‚Äôt any stigma attached to it (which is prevalent where I am) that is stopping me, but rather, admitting to myself that this is more than just a hiatus is still a struggle to me. 
My money had run out before I even left. My dog got sick and it cost nearly $17,000 to get him better. Worth every penny and not everyone will understand. How do you tell someone that, selfishly, a dog was your lifeline. If he dies I die. He deserves, in my eyes, to live regardless of the price. 
By the time he‚Äôs old and grey I will be better, and resilient enough to let him go on his own time. 
So we live a really simple life right now. I‚Äôve isolated myself almost completely. It is easier to process my day when my day is simple and undisputed. I ration what money I had left before I stopped working, the bills are piling up but I think I can make it work. I take my medication at morning and at night. I‚Äôve been working on feeding myself two meals a day. I have passions and I have hobbies and the cocktail I‚Äôm on means I‚Äôm not depressed anymore, barely anxious. 
This week I‚Äôll be going to my first PTSD group session at the hospital. I am slowly coming to terms with the fact that this isn‚Äôt going away next week. 
My dog is, as usual, as happy as could be. 
I‚Äôm really trying to be better. God, it‚Äôs a lot of work. I hate that I‚Äôm not alone in that struggle. I hate that there are so many people going through the same or worse. 
I hate how hard people have to fight for the chance to not even be happy, but just to.. not suffer. 
I really hope you‚Äôre all going to keep pushing forward.",04Feb2020,1

64,"I'm a grad student and prior to starting I always struggled with mental health, from the time I was 7. From body dysmorphia, anorexia, anxiety (and especially social anxiety), hitting myself, depression and being suicidal, the 22 years haven't been easy. However, my anxiety always would impact me enough to feel the need to work hard when I was badly impacted. Granted this wasn't healthy, it's was never efficient and it was always self punishing. But eventually I learned how to somewhat cope with these traits and at least get outside help when I needed to. Until graduate school, the past 2.5 have been especially bad (it's 3 year program).

Now I want to stress I understand grad school is no picnic for anyone, ever. And I am not trying to say anyone's experience isn't bad. But when I say grad school has been hard, I don't just mean academically. I mean structurally. Like I ended up joining a 20+ student group to sue to the school because the advisers were constantly lying to us about what was actually required and claimed certain students failed classes, when they didn't (because no an administrator can't just decide a b is fail because they want it that way). This actually resulted in some students getting their tuition money back.

I took three classes, almost 4 except thank goodness I postponed one of them. I never needed to take because an adviser was concerned they wouldn't have enough students in them and lied and said they were required. And some of you are wondering isn't there a curriculum sheet? Yes and no. We did have a curriculum sheet but we switched after our first year from quarters to semesters. The advisers lied to us about what classes equated to each other so they could fill classes for the next two years. This action almost cost every student their financial aid.

Which wouldn't be so bad, except all of those classes sucked and taught me and my classmates absolutely nothing for our careers. One classes I was supposed to learn about principles of design and we learned about communism, another we were supposed to learn about eco-friendly design and we learned about film. Another classes we learned about geography when were supposed to learn about design. 

This program has made me feel like an absolute joke. It's full time with expectation that you do not work. But I feel like I have learned nothing but have felt like I had to stay because I got a full ride scholarship (although in retrospect I should have left anyways but mental illness has made me feel like there was no option). Many professors also give feedback in the form of never ever telling you that your work is good enough. It's meant to motivate students to push them to their limits, but it makes me feel like everything is hopeless and that I suck at everything. You can fix everything a professor says to fix down to a T and then show it to them and if there is still time left before the due date they'll tell you they hate all the edits and to redo it. And many times this makes the final project a jumbled mess of trash that has been changed to for the sake of being changed. I've see this happen so many times. 

Even right now I need an elective to be approved (despite it being on the approved elective list) and my adviser is ignoring the approval because the elective topic isn't something she likes (which it's my elective she shouldn't get to say ""no this isn't the field I want you to go into""). 

I still do my work, especially in group projects, because if one thing has happened is that we've bonded as a grad cohort and I can at least get myself to work to support my teammates (luckily this is most of my work). But I have no idea how to recover from this and my therapist doesn't even seem to know what to say anymore. I feel completely unprepared to graduate and terrified I will never get a job. 

Does anyone have any similar experiences? How do I get back up from this? Is there a type of therapy anyone can recommend? Historically CBT has been very very very very very very very ineffective for me (with all the 8 different therapists I tried it with) but EMDR has been great and acceptance/avoidance has been ok. My brain feels fuzzy most of the time, I cry every Sunday night because I'm so afraid of school, I can't keep my vision straight during classes, my health has declined drastically (within the past year I'd had two surgeries), I make simple mistakes all the time I never used to make, and my memory has become absolute trash.

Please delete this if unfit to be here.  
So I just want to say, I have been in therapy for YEARS. Two years ago was the first time since 12 I‚Äôve been out of therapy. Insurance won‚Äôt cover therapy anymore and if I still wanted to continue, I would have to pay out of pocket for each session which would be 80-100 dollars a week. Something I don‚Äôt have.

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs exactly wrong with me. I feel absolutely crazy and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I wish I had someone to vent to that was unbiased of my situation. 

I am so so obsessive. Especially over attention and getting it from men. 
I constantly want to be looked at and make my male friends jealous and I hate that I do this because I have an amazing boyfriend that is so supportive and sweet and caring and I feel awful that I‚Äôm lowkey flirting behind his back. I wish I can stop it but I literally cannot. 

And I feel like I‚Äôm gonna stalk my ex also.

69,"Ok how do I put this. 

A little context, this is in regards to one of my friend groups, specifically the group of friends I play DnD with. I‚Äôm the youngest in the group (20F), and on top of that, I also have ADHD, which leads to me interrupting ppl often, and I‚Äôm particularly verbose (as you can probably tell). Also, semi-related, but I‚Äôm going through a depressive episode since like last March. 

So a couple months ago, I was playing Overwatch with a couple of these friends, and later asked one of them if I was annoying them in some manner (I hate being annoying, it‚Äôs killed friendships before). He replied that I have a tendency to start talking about myself and my own POV about stuff, while not listening to others. 

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, when talking to a couple ppl in the same friend group over voice chat, I interrupted one three times in about a minute (dick move on my part), and they chastised me about how in our upcoming arc I need to work on taking a backseat. Just last Saturday my friend and DM mentioned the same thing. 

Now, I know, objectively, they‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm rather self centered and oblivious to the world around me, and talk over people a lot. 

But I keep fucking spiraling. RSD kicked me in the teeth both times my friends approached me in the past couple weeks, which isn‚Äôt helping either, and I just feel like I keep acting more and more like a selfish jerk and hurting my friends, when I don‚Äôt want to do anything of the sort. I‚Äôm terrified of taking advantage of my friends or hurting them because I lashed out, and I have a feeling I have already. And I don‚Äôt want to get kicked from my campaign or anger my friends or anything. 

It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I am semi-seriously considering either taking a break from the campaign for a few weeks for their sake, dropping the campaign altogether, or just. Cutting off contact with most of my friends (not just that group, some other friend groups) and isolating myself. Because hey, you can‚Äôt keep interrupting ppl and hurting them if you‚Äôre not *around* them. And I *don‚Äôt* to drop the campaign, as not only is it the highlight of my week but I *also* know that if I leave it completely, not having that uniting subject means I‚Äôll lose that whole group of friends. It just feels like dropping the campaign would be better for the rest of the group. 

I started going to one of my campus psychologists last week (I‚Äôm in college, duh) and I‚Äôm on meds for ADHD, but they have a tendency to increase my anxiety and that doesn‚Äôt help at all. 

I guess this turned into more of a vent post than asking for advice, and god knows I‚Äôve left a lot out, but. If anyone has some reassuring advice I‚Äôd really appreciate it. One thing my DM said I should do is work on my teamwork skills/be a team player more, and to be quite honest I‚Äôm not exactly sure how to do that. If anyone has any words, I‚Äôd appreciate it.

But at this point school is the least of my worries, I don't know how I'm going to keep on going. I've lost any pleasure in anything I used to find fun and now I spend all my time staring at walls wondering why I suck so much.

I used to ghost my friends all the time, I just couldn't handle socializing for too long, and if school wasn't keeping us together I would never see them again. It's not like I don't like them it's just what happens whenever I get into a relationship. My most recent ghosting was 4-5 months ago and I still haven't seen them since, it's like I sent myself to solitary confinement.

Life seems meaningless because even if I manage to get past all this, proceed to complete school and have a somewhat successful life, it will still be empty. I can't get hobbies and I can't have fun, I won't give myself any me time because I never do anything with it, I'll be empty like always.

But the reason I've come here isn't to vent out, I just need someone to talk to just to pass the time and get me through the day. Just be aware that I will eventually ghost you so please don't take it personally.",04Feb2020,1
88,"Hi /mentalhealth, I am not quite sure where to start with this post, but I feel like there is something extremely wrong with me mentally. I feel I am psychopathic and a pathological liar among other things. 

Here's some context - Ever since I was about 6-7 years old, I have been somewhat abused by my mother, both verbally and physically. Verbal abuse, objects thrown at me, punches, kicks, you name it. When I was in first grade, I picked up on a lot of swear words from my mother and at school, but I never was necessarily a bad kid behaviorally at school. I began to get physically violent with my siblings and my mother at about the same time as this. I would throw things at people, yell, scream, jump up and down, etc. One day, I was in an argument/ fight with my mother, and she was hitting me while I was on the floor. I proceeded to kick her leg in which the skin ripped open. For context, my mom has 'schleroderma', not really sure how to spell it, which means her skin is really brittle and thin among other things. After this, my behavior began to worsen at home, and over time I got in more and more fights, arguments, etc. This all started to somewhat stop when I was 14, when I entered high school. But from then on, I've been a general piece of garbage -- a manipulator, a pathological liar etc. I had also become extremely socially awkward, to the point I could hardly talk to anyone without knowing them for a while/ being comfortable with them. I stole money from my parents, opened credit accounts in their name(s), etc. I got in fights with my sister which ended in her beating my ass. I started seeing a psychiatrist when I was 15 and to this day I lie to him about my wellbeing. 

I am 17 at the time of this post, 18 in about a month and a half. I genuinely hate myself but at the same time I don't care about where life takes me; I use people and I am a general asshole. I have been diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder, and ADD. I'm not sure if any of that is true since I lied during the evaluations. 

I also spent thousands of my own, hard earned dollars from a job I feel like I can barely hold down last year on electronics which I usually end up selling after about a week for much less. I have trouble holding onto money so I used to steal money from my parents to get more. I do not do that anymore but I feel like I'm a completely different person that what I display at home, but those home aspects are finally seeping out into my everyday life, making everyone think I'm crazy. Maybe I am, who knows. 

I am very intelligent both on the streets and in the books, and I believe I may be a genuine psychopath. I have sold others belongings and lied to countless people. I also think about suicide a lot, if I were dead I would have no one to fuck over. I DO feel emotion, but only if the event procuring it affects my day to day life. I just don't know what to do anymore. Please for the love of God, what do I have, and what should I genuinely do?",04Feb2020,1

95,"Does anyone here journal for mental health? What benefits do you see? I used to journal so much as a teenager, now I‚Äôm 30 and I feel my life is out of control.

I am sitting by myself in a dark quiet livingroom.. it happened again, I did it again. 
I called in sick from work with some wild story.. because I couldn't find the energy or motivation to even get dressed. I am throwing my life away like this and I don't know why. As I have no friends or anyone I can open up to I will use the anonymity of the internet to vent.

It's happening more frequently again, and I've used every wild excuse and lie I can think of. I can't keep going on like this it needs to stop! But I don't know how. It's like some days.. from the second I open my eyes I feel it in my chest, and this voice in my head, my mind starts rolling through every previous excuse I used to get out of work trying to come up with anything. I then proceed to feel like a piece of shit the entire day and be completely unproductive. Usually I sit on the couch for hours just staring at my phone with all lights out eventhough I have a ton of work. 

It's coming to a point where I'm afraid I will be called into the office and be questioned about it all. My work is great, I get to stay with my lovely boyfriend (who doesn't know about me calling off work frequently btw) and have the opportunity to pass my final nursing exams in 2 months.

What I'm struggling to deal with is the fact that people here tend to relentlessly talk down about everyone else. There seems to be more concern with making others look bad than making themselves look good. 

I'm also working opposite shifts of a guy that refuses to do every part of his job, what's worse is that the management here is so lazy that they refuse to do anything about it. I catch him lying on paperwork daily, yet when I point it out to my superiors I get told he didn't  do it. They seem almost willfully ignorant. 

It's becoming hard to deal with the stress here, I can only find so many stress and anger management techniques. Yet every adjustment I make to myself seems to be met in kind with pushing my limits even further. I've stood my ground and spoke to my superiors about how badly this affects my daily life, but I tend to get the same placating language that everyone else gets, without any real changes ever being made.

102,"My kid is 9. He can be the sweetest, or the not so sweetest kid ever, but he's like living with a little jekyl/hyde. The best way to describe it, would be a light switch analogy:

He listens well, very sweet, nice kid for a few days, sometimes as long as a few weeks... and like someone hit a switch, he's suddenly rude, obnoxious, cant control himself, very little emotional regulation, throwing things in tantrum, scratching/hitting/kicking, fights everything no matter what, for a few days or weeks, and then like someone hit a switch, back to being the sweet kid.

He just had about 2 or 3 weeks of really good behaviour, but the switch has been flipped and for the last 3 days he's been extremely difficult.

103,Hey guys I‚Äôm kind of new to this. Soo I‚Äôve been living with this girl for almost a year. And about maybe 3 months ago. Her Grandma Left to Dominican Republic to take care some business. And we been watching her 3 year old Toy poodle mix. Named Bella. I love her I do. But when me and my girlfriend get into an argument the dog shakes and pees. I kind of already know why... for a while I used to Attack the dog from whipping it with its leash to Almost drowning it while bathing her Because she peed on the bed. I‚Äôm not no type of animal abuser because I‚Äôve grown around dogs and cats. Hell at one point I used to work with dogs from the shelter so I know a scared and abused dog when I see one. So anyway Bella used to be so loving and kind and even tho she still kind of is.. I feel like she only likes me because she‚Äôs scared of me. I know I sound crazy and shit but I want to know what can I do to make her like me again. And go crazy for me everytime she sees me. I get so mad though. Like When my girl will leave the room. She would run after her. I‚Äôll Try to Calm her but all she do is shake.  I‚Äôve dealt with seeing my mom be abused.. but I was never the type and still feel I‚Äôm not the type I don‚Äôt know where all this rage comes from. I was always loved as a child. I‚Äôm 24 years old now... so I feel like if I was gonna become an abuser it would‚Äôve happened already. I just want the damn dog to like me again. I do love her. I just Get so mad sometimes I take it out on her. Then she‚Äôll look at me with those Eyes like ‚Äúreally nigga..‚Äù I just want it to end I do care about Bella and my girl. We just argue tooo much and since I‚Äôve already attacked Bella I‚Äôm kind of already used to it and I do feel some type of power omg I sound like a monster but I‚Äôm not. I love animals I used to take care of them and loved it. So for this to be happening I just don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong.. it happens like all the time it‚Äôs not a one time thing I wish it was or actually never happened at all. But it just keeps happening I keep telling myself it‚Äôs not gonna happen again. But from me attacking my girl to her dog I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with me. I see a therapist but I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable telling her about me hitting a dog..I just want Bella to like me again. She don‚Äôt like treats..so I can‚Äôt give her any of those.  I don‚Äôt wanna be judged I just want to know how I can get Bella to like me again. The way she used too...,04Feb2020,1
104,"Hi,

I have not been feeling well deep inside as of late, I feel a void somewhere inside me that I can't pinpoint. I'm the usually stronger vessel, problems or difficulties never really got me down, but here I am now unable to help myself.

I usually feel this before during teenage years but not to a very extent.

To give you all a gist of what I've been going through here are some threads:

Note that I'm a recently married man and a recently turned Christian

Here's what my wife had been doing, although I've been seeing improvements as of late, but I still can't seem to get a hold of myself and I couldn't feel at home with her anymore.

I ended up posting on r/phr4r of possibly hooking up to get a quick fix.

Why do I think I need help now\*\*? - I just cried while taking a bath, I feel trapped.\*\*

106,"Hey, r/mentalhealth. 

My whole life I've struggled to focus. Reading, writing, gaming, socializing, all of it. I've read entire books and have been completely unable to tell you details about the book just a few days later. I've started hundreds of writing projects and games and books without finishing them. I have conversations with people and have to mentally remind myself to concentrate on what they're saying, only to miss what they're saying because I'm reminding myself to focus. Novice googling tells me these are textbook signs of ADHD. 

To give a little bit more background, I'm currently finishing up just over a decade of service in the Navy's nuclear power program. One of the drawbacks of the program is that any sign of mental instability or mental health issue is met with removal from the program. Makes enough sense, right? You don't want people struggling with mental health issues running nuclear reactors. 

The problem here is that people in this program HAVE these issues, they just don't report them. They do their best to cope because the second the blow the whistle and try to get medication, the Navy processes them out of the ""pipeline"", so to speak, to put them in a different job. 

All this just to say that I haven't gotten help yet because I don't want to lose my job. But I get out in December, so it will soon not be a problem anymore.

Now I'm no medical professional, but I know that, if properly evaluated and diagnosed, people are often prescribed medication for ADHD. I've heard time and time again that their lives are dramatically changed for the better afterward. 

My question is this: is this realistic? Is it worth it to go through the process of getting a therapist to evaluate me, get prescribed some long-titled jumble of chemicals, and start taking it? I'm not knocking the legitimacy of medicine at all, but I'm skeptical about it. Miracles don't exist, and I'd rather not go through the money loss, pain, and wasted time to get something that isn't going to help that much or at all.

Any help or advice you can give me is greatly appreciated.",04Feb2020,1
108,"(Weight related) 
Not sure if this belongs here but in elementary/high school I struggled with my weight and would fast/purge to stay where I was. In grade eleven I developed some health issues and within a few months lost about fifty pounds and weighed less than I had since before puberty started but I still felt fat. Looking back I‚Äôm miserable I was so unhappy with my body bc I‚Äôll likely never look that good again. Surprisingly, I usually don‚Äôt feel as horrible about my body these days despite the fact that since getting better I gained the fifty pounds back (ofc), plus twenty more... 
I feel like one day I‚Äôm sexy and confident and the next I‚Äôm verging on suicidal and decide I‚Äôm going to stop eating to lose weight and that my bf CANNOT see me naked, this makes actually losing weight SO HARD because I flop back and forth between liking how I look and hating myself. 
My bf is really into art and fashion culture etc and with that he follows a lot of anime style art, Japanese fashion companies, and beautiful girls on social media. Whenever I see this or even just when I‚Äôm left alone to remember I feel AWFUL and convince myself he could never like or be attracted to me because I don‚Äôt look like that (I‚Äôm chubby and white and don‚Äôt have nice clothes) and then again spiral into needing to lose weight. I don‚Äôt want to feel like this because my bf has never said negative things to me about my appearance and everything he has said that I‚Äôve taken badly has (I can admit) been me twisting his words or taking them the wrong way. But regardless, it puts strain on our relationship for me to feel he thinks those things about me and that I need to be skinny to make him love me.. 

Why am I so back and forth?! I don‚Äôt want to hate my appearance but at least if I did consistently it would be MUCH easier to decide I‚Äôm going to lose weight and not change my mind two days later!

Idk why this happens because he has never told me I‚Äôm any of those things but I also don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to do about it.

119,"26F from the EU (pardon my awkward English).

I am slow (and perfectionist) at anything that has to do with cleaning: taking a shower, washing the dishes, cleaning myself when I go to the toilet, washing and preparing vegetables. Common things that needs to be done every day or so.

I'm also slow at eating, for some reason. First few bites, when I'm hungry, I'm fast as anyone else. Then I have to stop for a bit (because I feel full), take another bite, stop again, take another bite, and so on until I'm done. I'm **always** the last one to finish eating when I'm in a group of people, **by far**.

I'll describe my issue in more details in the following paragraphs, that you can of course skip.  
**WARNING**: it's quite long, and may be **disgusting** to read for many of you (especially because I'm a girl and you probably can't imagine a girl like this lmao)

| -------------------------**DESCRIPTION START**\---------------------------- |

Because I'm so slow with cleaning activities, I try to do them as least as possible. If I'm home alone all week, I shower once (only wash my armpits if they smell). If I have to go to work, I shower only on Wednesday and Sunday (armpits every day especially during summer).  
When I was 14-15, I had medical problems because of the fact that (for several years) I had been trying to go to the bathroom as least as I could. I ended up having a [fecalith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecalith) in my intestine, causing me some serious pain. To get rid of it I had to take medicines and do enemas (**horrible**). After this experience, I understood that I couldn't continue like that, and started going more often.

But **why** does it take me so long to do this stuff, you may wonder.  
I feel like I have to, uhm, use lots of toilet paper to clean over there. I, uhm, ""iterate"" the process many times. For the 'big one': after cleaning as usual, I also clean *the hole* with wet paper (not all wet, just the center). I do this until basically I see no dirt on it. Takes quite some time...  
You see, in my country we have [bidets](https://www.deghishop.it/files/deghi_Files/Foto/1160595_5.JPG) in every bathroom. I use it only before sex (amazingly, I'm in a relationship lol) or (sometimes) when I'm on my period. And, of course, I ""use"" it to dampen the toilet paper as I said before; that's my main use lol Speaking of periods... that's when I **really** waste tons of time in the bathroom lol Like, even **an hour**, if I can.  
If this wasn't disgusting enough for you to read, consider this: to ""properly"" clean my privates, when I was a teen, I realized I had to clean my pubic hair too, right? Well, by doing that, with toilet paper, I accidentally developed a form of [trichotillomania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichotillomania). Recently I started to completely shave my privates, just to stop wasting time doing this...

Let's talk about showers now (less disgusting, I promise). I used to be in the shower for 45 minutes. I looked up if other people do this, and it seems like everyone who does this, it's because they **like** being in the shower for that much time, they find it relaxing, etc. (many masturbate in there lmao)  
This is **NOT** my case, in fact I hate it, as I said, because it takes so much time for me.  
Now I can manage to take a shower in 30-35 minutes, but if I need to shave it's, of course, even more.

Many times I've been asked why it takes so long for me, what the hell I do there. Well, I don't know how **you** can take a shower in 5 minutes.  
Here's what I usually do: 1) Wash with water. 2) Apply shampoo on hair (until I can feel lots of lather) and soap (liquid, ofc) on my face (rubbing carefully every spot, like behind the ear). 3) Wash (or I can't see because of soap in my eyes lol). 4) Apply soap mostly everywhere else. 5) Wash. 6) Soap on armpits and feet. 7) Wash. 8) Armpits + privates. 9) Finally, last wash.  
(When I was even slower, I used to apply shampoo twice and have like three more ""wash"" steps).  
I feel like, if I don't do like this, I don't clean properly. It's ironic because, in a way, I want to clean myself very well, but at the same time most people shower way more often than me (every day). But it seems I'm unable to this cleaning stuff differently, once I go about doing it :|  
Taking into account the time pre-shower and post-shower, I need about 1 hour and 20 minutes to have a shower. More, if I need to shave.

As for washing dishes, similarly, if you wash some dishes in 5 minutes, it would probably take me half an hour. Again, I have my personal ""technique"".  
1) Wash the dishes with water, preferably until you can't **see** any dirt on them. 2) Rub them carefully (not quickly) with the sponge (with liquid soap on it, ofc). 3) Wash.  
Why do I try to remove visible dirt before using the sponge? Because otherwise, I feel, the sponge would take the dirt and move it on the dishes while supposedly cleaning them. Doesn't feel right to me.

To be honest, when I see dishes/flatware at other houses, sometimes I can see a little dirt on them (I have very good eyesight.. unfortunately lol). So these people are faster than me, but I guess their method is not as good as mine and/or they do it too quickly.

| -------------------------**DESCRIPTION END**\---------------------------- |

Why is it an **handicap**? Because it eats lots of my time, of course. Other people, in a day, can work for 8 hours (9 including lunch break), take care of their life and have some time every day to do something they like, such as playing a videogame for 2 hours. **I can't**. Because of this, living on my own and working is **awful**, it's like prison. I can only work and survive. This is why I'm **scared of life**, at least adult life. And having kids? I can't even imagine how could I do everything I need to do if I had kids. Impossible for me.

Why do **other people dislike me** for this? Well, even if I try to explain them (in much less detail lol) why it takes so much time for me to do things, they don't seem to fully understand. They seem to think that I like being slow, because it's more relaxing or I don't even try to be faster. I also find it hard to be on time for appointments, of course. When I'm with my family I hate doing stuff like washing the dishes, and from their point of view I am just lazy and selfish.

Even going to therapy is difficult, because it takes time! And money :| At the moment, I would have to use my mother's money to do it, and even if she can afford it and would gladly help me with this (she's a psychologist herself and thinks I need therapy really bad lol), I don't want to do it, especially considering that there's no guarantee that it's going to work. I think I need a therapy that goes really deep, until the thing(s) that makes me feel the need to do things the way I do them.. are gone. I don't think cognitive behavioral therapy would work. I've seen three therapists in the past, by the way (one was 'free', paid by the state). For reasons, I stopped seeing them after a while (two of them were particularly bad). I don't know if I'll go to other therapists, maybe. But it certainly feels like another burden for me.

Now I‚Äôve had very consistent rumination, telling myself I can‚Äôt do things, and having fear really limit my life day in and day out. I didn‚Äôt use to be like this

121,"I've been depressed and recently, there were signs of relapse. I'm doing better today but due to the fluctuations, people around me aren't sure if I'd be, overall, mentally okay.

Now the higher ups from my work who found out about my recent relapse and self hurt tendencies were suggesting if I should take few months off of work. Tbh, I don't want to take a medical leave because idk what I'd be doing if I took a break. Also, work distracts me from overthinking, especially when I'm extremely focused with it although they mentioned that it contributes to my stress when deadlines are coming due.

I impliedly told them I don't want that option so I was told to reduce my load. Now I know they do it out of concern but I feel incompetent due to the load reduction - that I can't finish my own work and they would rather have me distribute some of it to others. They were persistent so I agreed but the reduction should be based off what I'm willing to give up doing - i.e. fairly insignificant load reduction.

To give a heads up on what makes me feel like relapsing, I think it is due to the following factors:

1. Talking with people whose mental health is worse than mine - For example, receiving texts from my best friend that she wants to die, hearing others cuss while engaging in conversations with me, etc. I realized that this has a huge impact on my then declining mental health as I'm taking in all their emotions. I guess this was the reason why my psychiatrist didn't want me to join a depression support group during my worst relapse since hearing their experiences will worsen my suicidal tendencies. As at date, those kinds of conversations stopped.
2. I have a suspended (because guys were harassing me, to say the least) other reddit account where I post some nsfw stuff. I started posting only this January 2nd/3rd week on this one subreddit (mainly audios) and I got top 1, 2, and 15 post of the month on all 3 of my posts per my last checking before my account was suspended. It made me feel like I was in uni all over again where I felt pressured and stressed out thinking what would others say if I won't do well. I got ridiculed in uni when my grades weren't always the highest so I worked harder to be consistently at the top, or at least within that range. Now with this subreddit, because I got top posts on all my posts, I felt the same pressure. And it was affecting my focus in everything - I was paranoid that I won't be enough and people won't like me if I won't make a top post. Getting suspended is a blessing in disguise since I had time to breathe and realize that I shouldn't be worried over a popularity of some reddit posts.
3. In line with number 2, I've been stressing myself out to obtain donation funds to be donated for mental health organization who I haven't chosen yet. I panicked that I won't reach my goal of $1k (net of any charges) because it doesn't make sense to me why anyone would support me and my cause and advocacy (mental health awareness), considering that the general public lacks concern for mental health. I put immense pressure to myself and I set myself up for failure. I'm 23 and it's the only thing I think I can do to help people volunteering in spreading mental health awareness. Fortunately now and after the 2 weeks of posting on that audio subreddit, I got a few people and have a gross amount of $992 for donation (to be deducted by $120 for charges and fees - i.e. $870 net).

Now the thing is, I feel 'okay' now since those cases that makes me relapse were, in essence, partly resolved. But when they (work people) told me to try working less - working is something I'm very much committed to do and I'm willing to work 24+ hours of shift with or without paid overtimes -, it just left an unexplainable feeling inside of me. I just don't understand myself and all I know is I don't want to feel pitiful. I know I'm not making sense. I just can't explain what I'm feeling rn.

To summarize it all... I'm ""tired"" and don't understand my head/brain... again. I don't know what to feel/do.

124,"(posting in multiple Reddits)

After going to college for 6 years, i would imagine i would be able to break my atrocious studying habits. However, that is not the case. I am 23, have Depression, Anxiety, ADHD, I have seen over 10 therapists, undergone different forms of therapy for the last 10 years,  and gone to 3 group therapists, have been prescribed countless number of medications. Right now, i am taking the most important classes of my life that are training me for a specific career that is sustainable. But that doesn't change anything, nor motivates me to want to change anything. If anything, it seems that my bad school habits have gotten worse. This is what i have done, and still am doing to this day

\-I goof off during lectures and barely take notes. I rely solely on the slides posted online

\-I create a structured, fair schedule, but never EVER follow it. (For example, i had an exam today and all the answers were on the slides. But instead of studying last night like i planned, I watched 2 hours of TV and went to bed late, and showed up to class late... again)

\-Now the only way to push myself to study, even a little bit, requires me to have some sort of youtube video or twitch stream on at the same time (I always have to multitask)

\-I focus more on my hobbies and joy more than school.

\-Changing settings doesnt stop me from not paying attention or motivate me to study. I once sat in a library with my assignments in front of me, but i didn't do anything for almost 3 hours.

\-I avoid pressure in anyway, which is why I don't do work I'm supposed to. Because pressure makes me want to commit suicide

\-I try to form study groups with students, but am unable to offer anything because i never studied the lectures.

\-Even without technology in the classroom, i just sit back and daydream for hours.

\-It seems that actively and desperately seeking answers for my life dilemmas are all im really skilled at,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm seriously at a loss, and am unsure what to do. I think i'm a lost cause, because i can't break any of these bad habits. Failing would not only be costly, but also not going to school would make my parents kick me out. I have everything i could ever need to succeed in school, but I abuse, or don't use any of them.",04Feb2020,1
125,"I had a therapy review today and it left me in a really poor mental state and is weighing heavy on my heart.

For a backstory: I am 22. I recently met with a therapists who considered that I may have C-PTSD instead of BPD. However, my current therapist didn't acknowledge this so at the moment I am in MBT with BPD individuals. I am in the art psychotherapy stage and I recently completed my group psychoeducational phase. During this 13 week phase, I missed three sessions due to physical health reasons (I have a rare brain condition) and due to PTSD (I was stuck in bed with bed-wetting, not eating, only laying there in darkness due to flashbacks to my rape)

I had a review a couple of weeks ago at the end of the group psychoeducational phase during a severe low, where I ended up crying about something traumatic to the point where my therapist had to schedule another appointment for me, a check-up of sorts. I felt really upset after this session as my therapist didn't really engage with what I was saying, sort of just said ""hmm"" and asked me things which I found condescending, etc. In brief, I was discussing a past sexual assault, and I also ended up apologising repeatedly for the deep shame in missing three psychotherapy sessions. I told him about episodes of psychosis that I suffer from, which the therapist who diagnosed me with C-PTSD found severe, but my current therapist replied that everyone suffers from psychosis at some point in our lives so it's just a normal occurrence. I told him about the psychosis because it's part of why I have such a strong reaction to flashbacks - the bedwetting, not eating, and not getting out of bed to go to appointments is all due to the psychosis. He didn't acknowledge this.

When we scheduled this follow-up, I had to ask to reschedule it as I had a rough experience. I was still upset after the last appointment and the way we left things made me prone to high anxiety and flashbacks. This day, my uncle was staying over, and as I was getting ready for therapy in my living room, he closed the living room door and pinned me down hard for 30 minutes - reading some sort of religious prayer on me as he thought I had a demon in me (he doesn't believe in mental illnesses). This experience was so extremely traumatic and I believed I was about to be raped again. Eventually my uncle finished holding me down and praying over me. I ran to the bathroom and cried. I asked my sister to call my therapist's receptionist and tell them what had happened. I didn't leave the bathroom for hours.

After this, I stopped eating out of distress. I lost 5kg before my next appointment. Losing weight is not good for me as it causes low intracranial pressure headaches related to my brain condition. In addition, there was an issue in dispensing my antidepressants so I was without them for 6 days - causing sweats, self harm and paranoia. I asked if my therapist could call me and he said he didn't offer services like that. Due to this, I had to cancel my appointment one last time.

Today I finally got to see him. In the last week, I managed to get back on track with my life - I got my antidepressants, have taken up swimming, started yoga and self care. I told him how well I was doing now and apologised for the state I was in in our last session. He asked why I cancelled both of those appointments, and I described in detail about the incident with my uncle and how it made me feel. Then later I described in detail the impact of it on my eating, my anti-depressant situation, etc. He didn't seem to respond at all to it except to ask for further details. It hurts a lot when I open up and the person on the other side doesn't acknowledge the incident or how painful it is. He quickly moved on to the next topic - attendance.

My therapist asked me how others in the group must feel when I miss sessions. I spoke of how attachment is harmed and how the sense of community is disrupted when I missed group psychotherapy sessions. He sort of reiterated that and said that it could prevent others from moving forward. I apologised for any harm I may have caused to anybody in the group. I also apologised to him for my poor attendance, but I had already apologised deeply in the last session so I thought he understood by now.

He asked me at some point about what I will do about my physical illness and how it may disrupt therapy. It's a permanent disability but it felt like he wanted me to say that it would be solved? I said I will have a surgery some time in the next few months regarding my intracranial pressure and so that I may lose weight safely without it causing these low pressure headaches. This is true, but I am still on the waitlist. I told him it may not be preventable and with a disability like mine, I may need some days off. He didn't really like that.

I asked if he believed that my spot should go to someone else, which he ignored. I apologised again for my absences. I explained how ever since \`I was sexually assaulted as a child, I have had a difficult time with attending anything regularly (school or work), and that I am now taking a much more active role in caring for myself. He didn't acknowledge the CSA but kept reiterating the impact on the group when someone doesn't attend. I apologised one last time and told him that I understand if he doesn't believe that I should begin the next phase due to my absences. He said that, instead, I will need to take a 6 week break to sort out my physical health and get my surgery and I will begin the next phase afterwards (an 18 month phase).

I asked if the time could be reduced as I really would benefit from it but he repeated that the group dynamics would be disrupted if I take time off for my surgery during this time. I am not sure I can promise that my physical health will be stable for 18 months at any point in my life, and I don't know WHEN my surgery will be. I thanked him for his time and I began crying as soon as I left.

I had a severe panic attack and thought of killing myself by running into the motorway or jumping from the bridge above the motorway. I felt like I kept opening up and I do believe my absences were due to serious circumstances, but it was as if I was being told off for them due to the impact on OTHERS rather than discussing how I may manage them alongside the sessions. I felt so much guilt, as if my issues were not valid but just a disturbance to others. This is how my family treats me also, so I just felt so suffocated. I feel so rough, I don't think I can return to him but I keep telling myself that the next phase would involve another therapist so it would be different.

The only thing that prevented me from harming myself was to smoke plenty of cigarettes and shop for thread so I could begin a crafting project when I reached home. I kept trying to actively distract myself. I called my boyfriend, I didn't tell him what happened because I'm sure I was overreacting to criticism and, if a therapist couldn't, I don't think anyone could understand me. So he distracted me by talking about football and I just listened to him as I walked home with my thread.

I want to know, if I'm doing something wrong. Do I come across as too desperate for help? What should I change? I need help so that I don't ruin my last chance at recovery. I'm going to try my hardest to make every appointment, including periods where I am physically unwell because it's just a couple of hours of sitting with a group. But I wanted to know how I could improve myself as a patient in addition to this?

I hide a lot of my emotions around him otherwise because I feel only pain when I share things with him, and I feel like he doesn't believe me maybe? I also don't find any relief.",04Feb2020,1
126,Has anyone tried this method for bad anxiety? Did it work and would you recommend it?,04Feb2020,1
127,"I‚Äôve struggled with my mental health since I was in elementary school but my mom was not open to me getting help so when I started university in September of 2017 I spent a few months hyping myself up and saw a councillor on campus. The school councillors only work with people short term so as per their recommendation I allowed them to refer me to a therapist I could see more long term as well as seeing a dr and then psychologist (also on campus). 
The only problem is that the ‚Äúreferral‚Äù they gave me was a short list of therapists in the city and I called the one they recommended specifically after several hours of panicking and working myself up to it and my call is answered and I‚Äôm told she isn‚Äôt accepting new clients... great.. 
I contact a few more people through the list: all full and full waiting list :( 

Through this set back I continued to see the school psychologist and dr alternate weeks while I was put on antidepressants for anxiety mostly (I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs my biggest problem but it‚Äôs what she helped me with). 

Whenever I had to see the doctor I left feeling work and like my feelings weren‚Äôt valid. I felt like she put words in my mouth and thought I was there for attention which made me feel like a terrible person or like I was imagining what I‚Äôve been going through. Every time I saw the psychiatrist she would ask me if I had found a therapist yet bc I ‚Äúneed to get on that‚Äù and I know she was right. I was trying as best as I could but it‚Äôs so hard for me to talk to new people and especially hard to reach out when I was expecting to be turned down and scared they would be like the doctor.

Eventually the psychiatrist discussed it with me and convinced me to sign up for academic accommodations and made me an appointment to do so with the doctor. I went for that appointment and the dr more of less said I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúbad enough‚Äù to get accommodations. This felt like a huge setback and after what I‚Äôd call a ‚Äúbreakdown‚Äù I cancelled all upcoming appointments and stopped taking my medication. Looking back I can tell it did help and maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have stopped but I couldn‚Äôt keep seeing that dr and I couldn‚Äôt find someone to talk to like I was being told I had to. 

I go through short spurts (like this) where I‚Äôm able to tell I really just need to find someone to talk to but I don‚Äôt know how. I surf the Internet and find people nearby but I don‚Äôt know who I‚Äôm supposed to reach out to because they all specialize in different things and I don‚Äôt have a single clue what my goals are or what I need help with. 
How do I find someone when they all treat/work with different stuff I don‚Äôt know what is wrong with me? How do I do this when the only phone calls I‚Äôll answer are my boyfriends and moms because I have so much phone anxiety? I don‚Äôt even know how to overcome my fears of not being worthy of therapy or being turned away to even look into help most days. 
I guess I would just like some advice on how I can overcome these fears and not let setbacks derail the process for me. I‚Äôm scared because if I manage to find someone to have an initial appointment with and they tell me I don‚Äôt need to be seeing them or that we aren‚Äôt a good fit I will never try again but I don‚Äôt know; maybe I don‚Äôt need help and I just feel like I do",04Feb2020,1

Since then, I've actually got someone psycho..something that could talk with me, but she's having some personal stuff right now and she can't assist me now, so I'll just take that pressure off me here, thanks to anyone reading this post, I'd like to thank you for taking your time and caring about me, since I just got no one so close that I feel I could talk too.

As I thought that things were actually going for the better, I just feel worse every day for some reason.

Every move outside the range of 2m away from my bed is just making me uncomfortable, I mean really really much, I'm just asking other people to do stuff for me, basically all-day stuff.

I'd like to go out and just talk with friends, but I ain't even trying now, 'cause I'm scared they would just shit talk me or completely ignore my presence, since that's what I mostly feel like when I'm with them.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not socially anxious, keep that in mind.

Yesterday, I was just annoying my friend and we were watching reddit memes, and Windows being faggit as always kept spamming my friend with some notifications.

He clicked it and it opened his e-mail client, in which I accidentally saw some ""depression, anxiety, stress test results"" and he acted embarassed. That was okay, he's always promoted by others as the sad one, I care about him, he mostly just yells at me to fuck off whenever I get near to him, but I try to make him somehow feel less anxious by hugging him, cause I know he is hella anxious.

Well I took the test, just for fun I thought and actually got some interesting results.

 [https://www.depression-anxiety-stress-test.org/](https://www.depression-anxiety-stress-test.org/) 

That is the site I took it on, I don't know if the site is trustful, I didn't check it.

My results: ""Depression: 28 score / With 9 score being the average person""

""Anxiety: 4 score / With 7 score being the average person""

""Stress: 26 score / With 14 score being the average person""

You can take the test yourself to see your results if you want to. I know that it isn't scientifically accurate, but I like getting atleast some feedback.

I've also stopped eating, like totally, I can eat two slices of bread a day and be full for the rest of day, I just can't get myself to ear more.

I've tried to meditate, and I did for I think 30 minutes, felt like 5 minutes tbh. Well, didn't work either, I was hella angry after the ""meditation"" with just ""Fuck everyone and everything"" life motto. Also don't know why.

My trying to talk with people just faded away too, I don't even want to talk with the closest people. I just feel irritated by them not caring and just not being careful enough about me, I've started having that philosophy of ""If they don't care, I do not too"" and just being really angry and aggressive at them.

I think that they care but I just feel like they don't and I hate this feeling.

My free time consists of ONLY lying in bed and headphones on, nothing more. I am also a metal person, I don't think that it is a bad thing. I also don't know why, but through the music I just feel understood and like I'm being cared about. I've also started looping **Korn - Can you hear me** in my head, over and over again, with these weird vibes just flowing through me I feel understood and just relating to it.

&gt; Can you hear me? 'Cause I'm lost  
And I may never come back again  
And while my heart keeps holding on  
I know I'll never be the same again .

This is the main reason I like the song, I just relate to this at the moment so hard.

I think I have also problems with my identity, I feel like I've been switching my patterns of acting and feeling everyday. Could it be the Borderline Personality Disorder ? I think it is called like that.

Even when dreaming or meditating, I am unable to imagine other people, I just can not, because if I do, I get weird feelings and snap out of it.

Last night I took 3 hours to fall asleep, worsening every day.

I've been practicing some spirituality lately, and I've also tried some stuff to feel less sad, but same as always, nothing works.

I like to stand up for other people, I like to lead other people when they can't, I like to help people if they need some help no matter the time/energy cost for me, I would sacrifice myself for other people if we had to choose, I really would, cause if I lead in that situation, I take it as my duty to get behind for my group's victory. And now when I am down, why won't anyone do the same for me ? I keep annoying them and asking for just staying and talking with me, but no one wants to, I've been asking for help too, but I get mostly just some generous one-lines with them leaving afterwards. Did I fuck up ? Have I somehow brought this on myself ? I have no idea, sadly. And lately ? I can't even move for myself.

I get that they may not have time but seeing them playing games just after leaving me just makes me feel like I fucked up and insane amounts of hatred.

I would like to talk to people that care about me.

I feel empty, without energy, just nothing, pure void.

I just don't laugh that much anymore, I've lost my taste for humour.

What do you think?

I just feel lost.

Just lost.

I daydreamed all day, couldn't focus in class (daydreamed or just blankly stared somewhere), forgetting things, getting distracted easily, forgetting to drink, eat go to the bathroom, not being able to sleep and couldn't make myself do anything. The only thing that saved me for failing a year in school was my hyperfocus (on studying sometimes) and my symptoms weren't so severe and some of then weren't daily at that time. Then I tried to commit suicide by hanging, my symptoms stayed the same for 8 months but not after I entered sophomore year. Now my symptoms are daily  and got worse. Here are new ones: 
I have often headaches, when i read i skip most of the text because for some reason i just have to skip the text (idk why) or i read the words physically but can't understand them but at same time can (idk how to explain), my hyperfocus is gone so i'm failing most of my classes in school, got more lazy, started to move constantly in class (feet,legs,toes, fingers,hands,scribbling or bouncing my body back and forth), i have constant brain fogs, when i want to do something i get distracted by something (usually daydreams) forget about it and never actually do it also there is  probably more things but i can't remember right now.

143,"hello guys, first of all I'm sorry for the potential english mistakes I'm going to make, I'm French.

I think it's the best place to talk about this, since this sub is mainly dedicated to self acceptance and overcoming baldness ( yes I used this word because almost nobody shaved his head by choice and it's mainly a constraint).

Despite any genetic predisposition, I think I'm balding, even though I'm only 21. I became self conscious about it a year from now. My hair has always been an issue, I was bullied in school because of my gingerness, so in order to avoid this complex I dyed my hair during high school. I know it wasn't a long term solution but I found it satisfying while I was doing it. At that time I needed to build some social confidence by making a lot of friends, getting my first girlfriends etc. Hence when I considered that I had accomplished all those social steps ( second year of college), I came back to my natural hair color. nobody noticed it because my hair became auburn or dark blond, and I was not a real ""ginger"" anymore. I was really satisfied to have overcome this huge insecurity, and I felt released at this time.

however 6 months later, I started noticing some thinning and some recession, and since then I became totally obsessed about it ( you what I'm talking about, all those pathetic situation where you know the exact Norwood stage of all the male you see everyday, the mirror issues and obsession etc). Indeed I definitely don't want to become bald, I want to enjoy my youth by being attractive which I finally succeed at, and successful but balding will very likely prevent me from doing it. Ironically, my life is objectively great, I have real friends that I can rely on, a great girlfriend, and wonderful parents. Furthermore, I'm doing extraordinarily great in law school since I have the best results among 300 students, and I'm valedictorian, so this allows me to apply to the best business law masters. Nonetheless, balding is destroying me, and I don't really have hope in the future, I'm starting to feel totally depressed and I have really dark thoughts. I hate the way I feel on a daily basis, I really can't stand it anymore, and I don't want to handle it aswell.

Self harm, depression and a bit of a mention of suicidal feelings


I feel so depressed. It all started last night. I don't know what happened. I was in such a good mood all weekend and now? I don't know. I'm so lonely. I don't know what to do with myself. I'm sick as well and I just. I don't know. I don't know what I'm feeling.

My partner, the only person I can talk to about anything in my life, has been ghosting me for about four hours, not including the time in school I spent hiding in the library from people. I don't think we've had a conversation that wasn't broken up over hours of them just ignoring me and occasionally sending me one message in response to mine in about a week. I feel so lonely and tired. I just want to sleep. But my back really hurts and I have things to do and I just cant. I have so much to do but I don't have the motivation to even get out of bed.

It's only fucking Tuesday.

I know this feeling. From years ago, from the worst year in my life. When I first started self harming, when life was just unbearable. Except now I also have mental issues to deal with on top of that. On top of my partners issues. On top of the overwhelming feeling that I'm not ill enough to deserve attention. I have never told any of this to anyone. I have never been to therapy. I have never told anyone about my self harm (willingly). I haven't felt like this in two years. And it's going to be so much harder this time round. I'm not suicidal, but I'm just scared I might become like that. Because if this goes on for much longer I'm scared it will get unbearable. It's already getting close. I'm just so scared.

I'm always on my phone because I always need a distraction. I always need something to do with my hands and I'm not satisfied just watching a video without absent mindedly scrolling through reddit at the same time. I want to talk to my partner. Just talk to them. Not even about any of this I just want them to pay attention. We used to talk all the time. I don't know what's happened and im just terrified that somethings happened to our relationship or I've done something wrong or something.

I mean I know I've done something wrong. Like hide from them and not want to go out to their house because leaving scares me. But ill just figure it out. I've gone past a point of no return in terms of seeking help. There's just too much for me to have to talk about. I can't do it. Because then I'll have to talk to my mum and I don't want to talk to my parents about my mental health. I just don't. So I'm going to have to wait until I'm medically independant in four years to get therapy. I can do that.

152,"Hello, I feel like I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about so also excuse me if anything doesn‚Äôt make sense. TLDR at the bottom.

I‚Äôve never had a consistent therapist. When I was about 16 my mother brought me to two different counselors for a few appointments each, but with both of them I found myself unable to open up as I‚Äôd put on a happy face when going out in public and could barely remember the details of an emotional breakdown the night before to talk about it.

I‚Äôm a sophomore in college and I‚Äôm trying again because I feel like my ability to handle emotions and thoughts has gotten worse. I don‚Äôt want to get into the details, but I often feel like I‚Äôm crazy and there‚Äôs something wrong with me and that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt really have close friends and I feel like everyone is doing better than me. When I‚Äôm at home for holidays I feel empty. I‚Äôve seen a therapist at the health center three times, and I‚Äôm currently looking to find someone off campus.

I have a question that I‚Äôm afraid to ask anyone, so please be gentle as I ask here. My family has always been weird about doctors, like even if they‚Äôre sick they don‚Äôt want to go and I‚Äôm afraid that trait has rubbed off on me and I don‚Äôt know how to handle physical health let alone mental health. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs normal and I just feel like my brain is broken sometimes. Friends have told me I have traits that would suggest anxiety, and my parents can pinpoint a time in my childhood where they think I was depressed, which is a time that still strongly affects me regarding friendships to this day. 

I was just wondering, if I‚Äôm looking for someone to consider diagnosing me (even if it turns out I‚Äôm 100% normal just crazy with a bad personality idk), do I have to ask about that? Is that taboo, or will it be weird like I‚Äôm trying to hard to have something I don‚Äôt? Will a therapist hear what I have to say until they think I should be diagnosed? Or would I need to see a psychiatrist or something? I don‚Äôt understand how the people around me have connected with a mental health professional and have these prescriptions and don‚Äôt feel anxious all the time.

**TLDR; I'm new to therapy. Is it weird to want to know if I feel like this because I have a mental disorder or something? Is it okay to ask a therapist about whether they might give a diagnosis or do they usually just do that eventually as they see fit?**",04Feb2020,1
153,"Don't really know why I'm writing this. Guess I just want a ranting space to spill out my thoughts and feelings.

I take bipolar medication to help me deal with high levels of depression and anxiety, and it supposedly helps keep my ADHD in check as well. When I was younger I had obsessive compulsive tendencies, though those have become more manageable as I've grown up. I have low self confidence. I struggle to pick up on social ques and often don't understand how to respond to people's emotions. I work in a small retail store and when customer's make jokes or imply things I often don't know what they mean, though I have learned to fake empathy and normality for the sake of trying to blend in with people, and to keep my job. Perhaps it's my anxiety forcing me to find a reason, but I'm starting to feel like I must have be on the autistic spectrum or something like that, why else would I feel so alone, other than the real possibility that my mental disorders have left me emotionally stunted in the ways I interact with other people. I'm miserable, and I wish I had someone I could tell that to without feeling embarrassed, shameful, or scared that they might say something shitty to me or give me unwanted advice and then mad because they went and said something shitty or gave me some stupid advice. I'm grateful for my few friends, but it feels like most people just aren't equipped to deal with someone miserable in a way that won't make them more miserable, so I don't want to open up.

The issue is that now whenever I try to speak to anyone about my mental health (be it a friend or a therapist) I immediately shut down and feel an extreme sense of shame, as well as have the feeling that my problems are not significant enough or worth wasting peoples time over.

But darn, reality-wise, I think the feeling is not mutual. I know it. But we did have flirty chats before which made me think I can have a chance on him. 

Then he changed. Literally, every messages I send him is considered ""spam"". I never felt so low in life, and I pity myself. There was a time when I just keep sending him messages without a reply. I feel so pathetic, that I started deleting these messages for me to cover up my desperation. I'm crazy over this person. 

We still chat though. Like casual things. No longer flirt or anything personal. Something like ""got new phone"" or ""your website is down"" etc. He changed. To me, he became a mystery I need to find and solve. 

I know his location through Facebook and he mentioned it before. But not specific. Note that I am overseas. This guys is somewhere in the Central Europe. I'm in the Pacific. 

Now, one day, I Google search his location and last name and found a street view of a very familiar place. So I looked at his photos from previous smartphone reviews (yes, I save those kind of photos), and It's the same place. He also mentioned some details like his mom owns a cafe below their house.

158,"(this post may not be in the correct subreddit.  I apologise in advance.)

BACKSTORY:
There was an incident that had happened recently when my daughter was home from school for feeling ill.  I was at work and she was with her Grandma and Uncle.  My daughter had her phone and was texting her friends and counselor about wanting to inflict self harm upon herself and commit suicide.  Her counselor called 911.  The police showed up and naturally DCF did too.  After reports, statements, etc. were completed, my daughter was given the option to go our local mental health center for outpatient intervention.  So, she chose to go.  It was a 3 hour deal.

My family has had a few run-ins with DCF.  I'm not going to go into much detail, but the cases were found unsubstantial and closed.  I will share this though, during the past couple of times of having the pleasure of DCF snooping around, my daughter told the workers how she wanted to be placed into foster care.

My daughter has seen a couple of therapists in the past, but her and them didn't really connect.  Since therapy has been inconsistent and that it's extremely hard to find a therapist who accepts state health insurance, she was never given the proper tools to help her go through the motions of her emotions in a...idk what kind of way hopefully somebody will have the word that I'm looking for though.  Maybe constructive?

She can be super super dramatic.  She's been through a lot of trauma growing up (she's still growing; she's an early aged teen).  Instead of my daughter using logic when she gets emotional she goes off of her feelings.  When she loses control, her thoughts and what she says become negative about herself and others.  Of course, they're all lies, but in the moment she doesn't realize this.  My daughter talks down on herself by saying she's stupid, she's always mean, and that she's not good enough.  She says how she doesn't want to live in this world anymore.  She feels that everyone hates her and how nobody cares about her.  Nobody loves her either.  She says things, like, ""I wish DCF would come and take me away"", ""I wish I was in foster care instead of living with this stupid family"", and ""I want to be placed into a mental home"".  Common teen, right?  Maybe, but more than likely not.  It's truly heartbreaking to know at more times than others she feels alone.  It's so hard to convince her that she's loved very much by not only me, but by her close family members too.  I understand so much of what/how she's feeling.  In my early twenties, I was diagnosed with manic depression and anxiety.  Depression is unfortunately inherent.  she more than likely has this disease too.

FAST FORWARD:

My daughter is going to be taking a mental health evaluation tomorrow so that not only her therapist, but her case manager and psychiatrist can help her further.  The process supposedly lasts roughly for about three hours.  I know that my daughter will be given a questionnaire to fill out.  Can anyone give me some examples of what the questions may ask?  Also, does anyone else know what other tests they may be giving her?

FYI:
I'm not going to coerce my child or sway her in any kind of way by telling her how to answer these questions.  I will tell her to be honest about her choices.  This way I can help her see that her answers will have a huge impact on the results.  I want her to know that a lot of the questions will probably be asking about her feelings.  I feel like once she reads one that she'll answer it by going off of her feelings instead of using logic.  I just don't know how to approach her without her thinking that I'm the enemy.  I'm extremely worried about how her answers may result in us having another encounter with DCF.  I'm even more terrified how they may take her because her answers will be negative.

I'm at a loss.  My kid doesn't know how to think logically when she's going through mental pain, so if she answers a question about self-harm, living in the safety of her own home, and/or about abuse with a negative answer, then DCF would more likely get involved. And all I want to do is prevent this.

Edit:
She's such a sweet, empathic, and intelligent young woman.  She is definitely her own individual.  I'm not putting her on a pedestal just because I'm her parent.  She truly is all of these things.

Edit:
I wish I was able to teach her how to address her feelings more in a logically way early on.  I just recently became consciously aware myself about why I've struggled with the same problems that are an everyday occurrence in her life today.",04Feb2020,1

My classmate and I have a friendship(I think), it's really hard to decide, because he sometimes feels like he's genuine about me being his friend, but sometimes he just uses me to get the test answers, or to take him home by ma car.

So anyway he's been leaving rude comments about me, or just pisses me, wherever he can. He calls me a g\*psy, puts sellotape in my hair, during IT classes, he lowers my seat giving me a heart attack. Whatever he can, just to crush my soul.

I'm a really shy person, I have lack of self esteem, because I don't really have many true friends, as most of them just want to use, that I'm a grade A student, to help them not fail or whatever. So I felt pretty proud about me standing up about myself, to say that I had enough, and that he should leave me alone. And it worked, for like 2 days, then everything went back to ""normal"".

174,"I'm gonna keep this somewhat brief. It all started 7 years ago with a act of kindness. I did the stupidest fucking thing I could've ever done, I helped someone in need. I cosigned for a new vehicle for my wife's sister, she needed a new vehicle badly for her 2 kids and hers had the transmission blow and zero coverage from the provider. Long story short I cosigned, she stopped paying it and moved completelt.outnif state 1 year later leaving the vehicle behind. So I was stuck with it unable to afford a lawyer to fight it. 7 years, $465 monthly payment, my wife became very Ill after the birth of our daughter in 2014, I was working full time minimum wage at the time, we had very little money to say the least. All we could afford was the rent and barely make the 465 payment. I went bankrupt, bank seized my 2nd vehicle my wife used to get back and forth to work so she lost her job after nobody would help us get her a ride, my credit cars debt was over the top. Leta fast forward to right now, I'm working a better full time job, the vehicle is almost paid off only 2 paymets left, we have a nice large 2 bedroom beautiful apartment, we can afford food instead of relying on catholic charities for every meal, my wife's health is recovered. Yet...I dont care..I dont feel any sort if relief or happiness, I cant cry joyfully knowing this 7 year nightmare.of grinding and clawing and working nonstop to pray we catch up is mere weeks from being done. My wife is confused she thought I'd be flying over the moon to bensine with this but I only feel tired. I feel drained, I feel burned out and ready to physically and emotionally collapse. The betrayal was enough to begin with but the initial emotion of fighting through and weathering this storm is nonexistent.

But by the choice of my pysch doctor because she told me I needed rehab and that she doesn‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm really bi polar . So she stopped treating me then after that I gave it some thought and got sober . Was going to go to rehab but I figure if I can not get sober or even stay sober what is rehab really going to do . Cause once your out of rehab you could still relapsed . So I was reading that the doctor is supposed to give you a dual diagnosis because of the bi polar and my substance abuse . Was wondering if that is corrected and also if that is corrected why and how come no one ever diagnosed me with a substance abuse disorder and help treat me for that also .,04Feb2020,1

I want to die. I don't actively want to kill myself, though I've entertained the notion and felt... relieved? I guess? When I thought about death. But I just wouldn't do it because honestly I'm scared of screwing up and ending up unable to even try again. 

I feel like I can't explain the turmoil in my head. It's so hard in there. I just cry, and scream, but when someone asks what's wrong, I just say I feel bad. I literally can't explain it better than that. I don't feel bad. I don't feel sad. I'm just tired of trying and trying and trying. I'm tired of being strong. I'm sick of being myself.

180,"Forgive me, this is my first post.

I am a middle-aged male that is married w/children. I have been married nearly 2 decades. My wife is amazing, she's good at everything she does and is type A personality and get things done. I am a shy type, I try to be a comedian and do so in all occasions. I make light of most things but inside I feel pretty alone. I have a few friends that I communicate with online only.

**Backstory**

Not that this excuses anything but I was abused as a child by a family member, I think. I'm not 100% sure which one but I'm 85% certain. Ever since then I have been sexually driven. Even at 8 years old I remember playing 'doctor' with my female cousin of basically the same age.  My early teen years I felt REALLY horrible about myself. I wanted to die as early as 14 or 15 years old. I thought about where and how.

Fast forward to my late teen years I was sexually active with my GF, we had a child but didn't end up together. I got married, and shortly after, I was unfaithful. Things were REALLY difficult our first year. Not that THAT was an excuse to do it but it was hell. She stayed with me. It was a painful 7+ years after that trying to crawl out from that shadowy hell I had placed myself in.

Few kids later, I did it again. She stayed with me but told me it was for the kids. As you could imagine, it was plain brutal after that. She went through her grieving process as one would do. She told me how horrible I was. What a piece of shit I am. That I was the worst person she knew. All true. I am still the worst person I know personally. We went to therapy together and individually. I got on antidepressants and have been on them for the past 8+ years. They kind of work. But lately, not sure if it's the medicine or my age but my libido has kind of gone downhill. I can't keep it up for more than 5 minutes so our sex life is gone, as well. We haven't done it for a couple of years now which on top of everything else makes me feel like less of a man that I felt before. 

If all of this wasn't bad enough, I think, well, I KNOW that I need help. Both medically and mentally. So after all of that BS I have an issue with extreme obsession with women I meet and get to know. Another female I interact with is on my mind constantly. Nothing would happen between us because the feeling isn't mutual, I'm sure. And I don't want it to happen. I know I'm a f\*\*\* up and I don't know where to turn. My friends that I talk to can't really help me. I don't spend any time with anyone other than my family. I literally never spend time with anyone but my family. Ever. I'm only away from them while at work and I can't go to my wife because my character flaws would only enrage her, and rightfully so. I feel my antidepressants aren't helping me any longer because my despair has returned despite adding another medication to my daily routine.

I feel stuck. I don't want to be attracted to other women. I don't want to be obsessed with other women. (It's not all women but I am such a lowly creature the thought does cross my mind to try something with any of them.)

Where can I go from here? How can I get help? How can I change my mental state when I've felt this way for 30 years?",04Feb2020,1

183,"This might be seen as cringey, but, please don't be mean to me.

I've been wondering, is this a part of a mental illness, or do I have nothing to worry about?

So, I've been doing this for as long as I remember, tbh. Like, I used to pretend to be my barbies and stuff. In like 1st grade, I used to write ""Alvin"" on my papers (I loved Alvin and the Chipmunks lmao). This kind of all just seemed like normal kid stuff. When I was about 10 years old, I started to roleplay One Direction, (Yes, this is very cringey, I know, I'm not proud of it, but I thought I would throw it in there anyway). And, obviously, I would pretend to be them in my head. And as I started getting into anime I started doing this with a lot of the characters. Up to 60+ characters across all the fandoms I've been in, excluding 1D. 

So, I'll talk about how it feels now.

I do it with characters, usually the ones that I think are the coolest, or even the ones that I feel like I personally relate to the most. I'm quite honestly almost always in this state of mind, unless I'm talking to my friends or family. Other then that, I'm always just kind of a character in my head, or multiple characters. Even back in highschool when I did this, I would be pretending to be them, like working on my math assignments and stuff. 

I want to say it doesn't interfere with my personal life that much, because I always slip back into my own mind when I talk to other people, like it doesn't affect the way I act personally. I never show it on the outside. Like ever. It actually interfered more with my personal life when I was younger. Its like I can just control it better, now, and that I can keep it to myself easier. 

But its obvious that it interfere's with my life a lot. Its pretty much, as long as I'm not talking to someone, I'm always in this state if mind. It doesn't matter if I'm eating, or if I'm walking around in a store. As long as I don't have to talk, I do this. Its honestly only when I'm talking when I'm not doing this. 

Questions are welcome, and I'd love to hear others stories if they have a similar story.

(For reference, I'm a 17 year old female.)

So my question is, is this something I need to worry about? And is this a specific mental disorder? I've looked into things like DID and stuff, but none of those seem to fit the bill.

To be honest, I think I'm just weird, lol. But, I want to make sure its not a serious mental issue.",04Feb2020,1

196,"I've had problems with depression and social anxiety for about 8 years now and its starting to get out of control. 

My family comes from the extreme poverty in southern U.S. and I was the first to graduate highschool and go to college back in 2015. I just got kicked out of my university during my final semester and must pay $5,000 back in finacial aid before returning.

Since 2015 my mental health has steadily declined. This is even reflected in my grades when looking at my academic transcript over the years. I don't even feel like the same person I was back then. I tried going to my university for help back in 2017, but they weren't very helpful. I don't have insurance to get proffesional help. 

Right now, I feel like a failure. I'm too afraid to ask for help and I don't know who to ask for help. My mom has plunged herself into debt she'll never be able to pay off, all so she could take out loans to help me pay tuition over the years. I've also run up so many credit cards and personal loans trying to take care of bills and family back home. After all of this, I have no transportation, no job, no degree and negative money. I have completed 118 out of 133 credit hours towards my degree with nothing to show for it, I can't even access my academic transcript because of the money I owe my university.  I'm being evicted from my housing and will have to move back in with mom, along with the 8 other family members currently living with her, in her 2 bedroom 1 bath trailer.

My plan is too work and save up for the rest of this year. Hopefully, I can finish up classes next year after paying off what I owe. I just feel like giving up. I have lost faith in my ability to be responsible and focused. I've wasted my mom's money. I'm in so much debt. All of my friends have moved away and are starting exciting jobs, buying their first cras, and moving to exciting places, while I will be back home sleeping on my mom's couch for the next year. I didn't expect this post to be this long-winded, thanks for reading.",04Feb2020,1

for context i find that writing my experiences as a rap song of sorts helps me look at these memories without freaking out to much so please bare with me if it doesn't sound logical

listen, i cry myself to sleep at night , but you don't know it

i try to be strong but i'm long gone , cause a man ain't supposed to show it

some type of parent you are for raising your hand on a kid

lets see how proud you are alone on your dying bed

its not personal you didn't know any better, bet you never did

but you never did , ask, or want to be any better

so whats this shit about not thinking for yourself you talk about

evidently you're a hypocrite and we both know it when you start to shout

""this hurts me more then it hurts you"" as i'm crying out

for god or someone to save me but all they did is stand by and listen

""if you keep on crying ill just keep on hitting""

next morning comes ""don't let the kid go to school""

""the bruises they show, what if they think i was being cruel""

I have 1 or 2 days of calling myself useless and all that stuff and just be angry at the world and then the next day I'll wake up determined to just be happy for everything. Happy that the sun is shining, happy that I can travel home for a bit, happy that the bakery smells amazing.

200,"Through this past year, I‚Äôve been working on getting my mental health together so I can get a job once I graduate (in a few months). I started applying  to jobs intermittently  since last April. I wasn‚Äôt able to do this full time because it gives me a lot of anxiety to set myself up to scrutiny this way. 

Last week was my second telephonic interview after a long time, and the interviewer seemed to enjoy the conversation. He told me I was qualified, that my work was impressive and gave me his email and phone number to follow up with him. Today I receive an email that they‚Äôve gone a different way. I woke up to this news, and I felt deeply hurt and vulnerable. 

I‚Äôm an international student and have been worried about finding a job in the US. I don‚Äôt have much time since my visa will run out and I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm doing wrong at this point. I have a masters degree, 5 years of work experience across different industries and I will be graduating magna cum laude. 

Sometimes I want to give up and go back home because I don‚Äôt have the fight in me to apply to so many jobs, and face so much rejection.

201,"I've been trying to help my friend with mental issues for about a year now, I managed to get her to stop cutting for about 6 months and things were looking up until about a month ago. She's been diagnosed with depression and has dealt with bullying and verbal abuse from her parents since she was young. I'm the only person she's told this much information to, including other friends, counselors, parents, etc. About a month ago she started cutting again, not regularly but every 2 weeks or so. I'm frustrated that she hides from her problems and tries to ignore them, relying on outside help. Yesterday I made a bad decision and I reached out to one of her previous bullies to try and understand what happened. I didn't gain any information from the bully, the only real result was that she got angry, had a panic attack, and refused to talk to me. I didn't learn until today that she tried to kill herself twice last night. She resumed talking to me today, but she's still angry and I know that I've broken her trust. I don't know what to do and I'm afraid I'm going to make things worse, I'm talking to a counselor tomorrow but in the meantime, I want to hear what Reddit thinks. Any advice is appreciated, I really just don't know what to do.",04Feb2020,1
202,"Hello everyone, 

This is a throwaway just because it‚Äôs kind of a sensitive subject for me. I (M24) have had a strong sense of gender dysphoria since I was a young child. I have a done a great job of suppressing these feelings but now it‚Äôs becoming increasingly difficult.

I have a few problems with dealing with this. I have trust issues and have a hard time vocalizing my feelings with other people. My family is very conservative and that scares me into suppressing these feelings. I have pretty much kept this a deep dark secret my entire life, I was thinking about telling my ex in college but I‚Äôm just too scared. 

Should I talk to a therapist and is there a way to not have these feelings without transitioning? It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want to (it would be a dream come true) I just don‚Äôt know if I could ever show myself again to friends or family. 

Any advice on my situation would be truly appreciated. Thank you all.",04Feb2020,1

204,"Hi. I am Pretty sure noone will actually read through this, but I've been struggeling for so long. Why is this such a Long process? 

I haven't been well for quite some time. I am 21 now but in 7th grade I started distancing myself from social life. My 'friends' left me hanging over and over again, so I decided to cut my ties to them but never really returned to socialising, mainly because I was known as the 'strange girl'. I was an easy pick, though I would no say I was hardcore bullied. I remember in 9th grade I asked a boy to a dance and he said he wasn't sure if he would be going. The next day my whole grade knew and made fun of me for weeks about how I could have asked someone out who was sooo out of my league. Anyways, the Internet and books were already my best friends by then and mostly I would be sitting or laying in bed.

Fast Forward when I started studying at uni. Over the last 12-18 months I have been spiralling downwards. I feel so overwhelmed, my grades just suck, I keep failing everything I touch. Sometimes I canot breathe or just burst into Tears. I hate myself for my failures. 

It got really bad when I decided to get a tattoo. As soon as it was done I hated having it on my body. I was just so stupid. And it is not small at all either. I spent two weeks in bed crying at my parents' (I had holidays by then). My parents sent me to our primary care physician because they are convinced my behaviour had to do with my thyroid (I have Hashimoto). My doctor said I was so tired and irritated all the time due to my condition and low iron. Once I was on the right medication everything would be fine. I already felt ignored that first visit but was putting my hope in these two pills per day. That was back in July/early August. 

Spoiler alert: I did not feel better. I learnt that I had failed more than half of my exams and it got Pretty bad again. Over the last Semester I were barely able to pull myself out of bed. I went to lectures, but that was pretty much all I could do. The rest of the time I spent in bed watching something on my conputer. I feel like a lazy loser who cannot get their shit together, but even showering is hard sometimes. If I don't have to go out, I mostly don't do it. I tried out online consultation, but where I live they courses and the only one my insurance would pay for did not help at all (it also was only for 12 weeks). I did not feel better at all after that. In those 12 weeks I also started dressing more muted (I used to war statement shirts proudly, had Nintendo legging I wore whenever they were clean, etc.), dyed my hair Brown from having them in bright colours since 2015 (blue, green, pink; name it, I wore it) and I took out most of my piercings. The piercings came last. The last straw for that was my grandmother, who, on christmas, did not even say hello to me but said she still could not stand to see my septum piercing.

My doctor checked my blood a few weeks after she first prescribed me my meds and said my values were fine, so I went back again to complain about my other symptoms that just got worse and not better. Then only she gave me the adress for a psychological consultation center. They had a 5-6 week waiting period but over Christmas it was more like 8 weeks. So by then I had already gone on for 6 months at the lowest I ever felt. I just want to be in bed all day and feel so, so guilty for pulling my family into this, since I spend basically all my time off with them. 

I had my consultation with the center last week, but as I said, they only do consultations, which is more of a short term solution. But with that woman I felt understood for the first time. In those 45min I was able to cry and she actually came up with a game plan on what I could do to get a long term fix for what I feel. She gave me whole printed out pages with psychiatrists and said one of them offered emergeny appointments in the mornings (that was not what the receptionist told me, but I got a cancellation spot on Feb. 24, which is far better than the 6 months waiting list). I also have a follow up Appointment with the woman from the center.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know where I was going with this, so I will just stop right here. 

If you have the time and energy, maybe you could leave some kind words or encouragement. I don't know if I deserve it, because I feel like an imposter most of the time, like I am a whiny white girl complaining about her o so bad life. 

So, yeah. Sorry for the rant.",04Feb2020,1

I miss his blanket of calm. I miss having someone who actually cares about me and my mental health enough to check in. I miss being loved by him just as I am, regardless of what I do or what other people will see of me. I miss just being in his presence and knowing that I don't have to worry about anything when I'm around him.
