2,"When my brother was younger, around his last year of school, he was going through some stuff and my dad suggested to see a therapist to which my brother agreed to do so.

After the therapist had a few sessions with my brother, the therapist told my father that he wanted to have a session with him alone since he felt that he is part of the reason why my brother had been struggling.

I wasn’t at all surprised that the therapist had that assumption about my father, I was just surprised that he had decided to have a session with him(without my brother present).

My dad has a short temper, and at the time he couldn’t take criticism or an insult, even it was a joke (it has gotten better).

He was pissed and decided to stop contacting the therapist and of course made my brother stop going as well.

My brother is fine now, when I asked him about it once, he just said that it was nothing and that he has moved passed it when he started going to college.

I just wanted to know if what the therapist did was completely normal and professional considering my brother wasn’t an adult at the time and so it was best to confront my father about it bluntly.

I was surprised because I always thought that a therapist’s job is to basically help his client by identifying his/her problem and helping him/her to cope with it or find a solution to it and basically not involve any of the clients friends/relatives directly.

My question is : Was the therapist’s approach uncommon or was/is my understanding of how therapy works wrong?",17Mar2020,1

For the last year or so, I’ve had the feeling that I wanna die but, I don’t wanna kill myself. I’d be completely okay with getting hit by a car, or killed in a shooting.

4,"I've been treated like garbage my entire life by the people close to me. They have done terrible things to me and as a result, I am too afraid to associate with anyone. Whenever I am with friends or family or even just out in public, I love the people around me and don't feel any negative feelings, but the moment I'm alone, I'm opened up to a slew of memories that fuel an intense hatred toward the people who have wronged me. The memories play over and over again and my hatred for these people grows stronger and stronger with each passing day.

&amp;#x200B;

I've reached a point where I habitually go online and take advantage of my anonymity to express extremely hateful beliefs that would make me seem like an absolute monster. But once I step back, I realize that I don't believe these horrible things and that I'm simply driven to say this stuff out of sheer hatred.

&amp;#x200B;

Some people will tell me to go to a psychologist to work out my issues but in all honesty, I see my problem as caused by external stimuli. I don't see this as an internal problem but rather one that outside forces have caused. Talking to a psychologist or taking some pointless medicine won't remove the memories from my head. I also don't believe in medical intervention to solve emotional problems and will never consent to psychiatric intervention.

&amp;#x200B;

I need some help on how to cope with this. I don't like feeling hatred at every second of every day.

5,"Whenever I get into a new tv show, movie, or book, I get so obsessed with it that I actually end up avoiding it. For example, I just watched a new tv show about ice skating and now I’m overly obsessed with wanting to become a figure skater and have experiences like the characters in the show. This desire is so strong that it makes me cry at night and I become so upset that I’ll never have that sort of life. I then end up avoiding any mention of the series and try not to think about it when I can help it. This happens a lot when I watch new shows or movies, which is a big reason why I mostly just rewatch the same shows. One of my friends mentioned that she sees a similar sort of obsession in her little brother with autism, but I’m not sure if these are the same sorts of things (please let me know if she was completely wrong). I was wondering if anyone has a similar issue or if this is a sign of being on the spectrum? I would love to hear any opinions or suggestions to getting over this, if possible :)",17Mar2020,1
6,I've always had mental health issues but they never really affected my friendships until recently. I feel a strong need to isolate myself and I don't want to talk to basically anyone. I used to be the exact opposite and depended on other people to make me happy and honestly needed to be talking to people a lot to just function. Not being dependent anymore has been really important for me but it seems like I've gone too far in the other direction. I make sure to tell my friends I still care because I truly do but sometimes I go weeks without talking. I don't want my dependency issues to come back but I also don't want to be alone.

8,"Autistic and some form of bipolar that's never been concretely confirmed as type 2 or rapid cycling or anything.

So for the last ten years I've been on sertraline. Initially I was on 100mg but that got bumped up to 200mg and then to 300mg during a bad time. I got bumped back down to 200mg and everything was... fine? 

Due to an illness last year it has been recommended I start on nortriptyline starting at 25mg and going up from there. In order to do that I need to come off of the sertraline and until last week everything was good. I'm under specialist care and under the psych's guidance I have decreased my sertraline and today come to a stop. I'm now on nortriptyline 50mg at night and 100mg of quetiapine.

The last week I have noticed that my ability to cope with... anything has plummeted. I got into a rage over the autocorrect on my phone because for some reason it cannot consistently capitalise singular i's. 80% of the time it just ignores that they should be capitalised. And when I say a rage, I mean, screaming, crying, hitting myself (for some reason it helps?) and being antisocial. Today I had to go to the doctors and pick up a script as I lost the original one. I spent the entire 20 minute drive trying not to cry or scream or both. I have no patience now, for anything or anyone. Someone going too slow on the highway? Someone not indicating or stopping suddenly? I can barely keep it in.

Honestly I want to just throw myself on the ground and scream. I don't know what to do and I don't know how to cope with this. I've got tears in my eyes as I write this but I genuinely have nothing to be angry/sad at? I'd rather be an over medicated numb shell than this.",17Mar2020,1
9,"I know we’ve gotten loads of COVID-19 posts lately, but I need some help here. I’m not even in a risky location for the virus, and everything in my life has been cancelled. I’m 16. My high school’s gotten cancelled for the next month, and people are saying it could possibly even be cancelled until the end of the school year. And I hate school as much as the next person, but I need that routine and normalcy, and I need to see my friends and interact with people. 

I’m not under a legal quarantine, but my parents won’t let me see my friends or even leave my house, even though I can drive. They’re trying to schedule my day out for me, from waking up early to when I do my schoolwork, and I need a sense of control over my own life. I know I can’t really prove this over text, but if you’re willing to take my word for it, I’m a pretty responsible person. I’m both cautious and good at self-managing/not procrastinating. 

So I’m basically being quarantined and controlled daily. I say this not to condemn my parents- I don’t blame them, they’re doing their best and trying to protect me in a scary new situation, but that doesn’t change how I feel. I’m just extremely frustrated and I don’t feel like I have any control over my own life.

13,"Hello,

So this is half a rant, half asking for advice.

I am in my second year of studying Computer Science with Games Programming at University and I am really worried about placements. This whole year we have been told to constantly go look for placements which I have been doing but have only found a few that I am interested in. I applied for these and so far have been rejected after submitting the technical tests because I clearly am not good enough to pass. These placements are very competitive, with only one or two spots.

Not to sound cocky or anything, but I have worked damned hard throughout my time in College and University, but feel like I have messed up somewhere? Like I have gotten firsts in all of my modules, firsts in every coursework I have submitted and passed everything university wise so far by a mile, but then I get to these placements and they expect me to be far better and know a hell of a lot more than I do!

I don't know if it's me doing something wrong, whether the placements are too competitive, whether the course is bad or what. Nobody on my course that I know has a placement. Additionally, every placement is asking for stuff we have barely even been taught, like a programming language called C++ - they expect us to know this in a great deal of depth, however, we have barely been taught it?

I have made my own projects, spent months upon months on my coursework, researched content that we aren't being taught, sacrificed a tonne of my life to get this far, and it just feels like I'm never going to meet their standards!

My uni has been on strike for a month and is now entirely online due to coronavirus which I don't feel has helped at all.

I'm honestly burnt out at this point and can't face applying for any more placements, however at the same time know I will be really disadvantaged if I don't get one, plus not getting one will really affect my mental health.

Anyone got any advice?

Thanks",17Mar2020,1
14,"I don’t know, I don’t have some big important future plans for myself so I don’t have anything to look forward to. I’m a sophomore in high school, I’m supposed to be a junior but ya. I’m trying my very best to pass this year but I guess sometimes my best isn’t good enough because I’m failing again! I can’t blame anyone but myself, I just don’t have a lot of motivation to do anything anymore. 

I feel like everyone hates me and that I put everyone around me in a bad mood. I feel like they all talk about me behind my back or when I’m in the same room as everyone and they’re all laughing together I feel like they’re laughing at me. I think they only hangout with me because my parents tell them to and by them I mean my 2 sisters, my sisters friend that lives with us, and my cousin. 

I hate everything about myself. My sister once asked me to name a couple things I liked about myself but I couldn’t name any. I don’t like to open up and talk about that kind of stuff with anyone, it was pretty embarrassing for me to tell her that I couldn’t think of any. Sometimes I can’t even look at myself in the mirror, I mean I can look at my face sometimes but I can’t stand look anywhere else. It makes me feel disgusted that everyone has to see me like that. 

I haven’t had a friend in like 3-4 years. Soooo my family moves sometimes. I’ve lived in like 11 different houses in like 8 different states, the past 3-4 years we’ve moved 3 times. I feel really bad for complaining because some people move a lot more than me and go through very difficult things and they don’t complain so why am I always complaining? I don’t know the answer to that. Every move I had to go to a new school and start all over again, that was until my freshman year when my mom decided to put me in online school. After my freshman year my parents forced me to go to a regular high school, I only went there for 3 month before going back to online. No one talked to me at school the 3 months that I went, I cried and had panic attacks what felt like everyday, I went to the nurses office a couple times a week because i felt sick to my stomach being there, I started skipping my classes to cry in the bathroom and when the school counselor found out she started walking me to my classes which sucked but I guess I understand. While I was still going to the public school I tried to kill myself by taking a handful of sleeping pills, didn’t do anything except made my breathing feel weird, i felt like I was in a dream the whole time, then I threw up and acted like nothing happened so let’s not go into anymore detail about that(I’m not writing it off as no big deal, just not something I want to dig into, ya know?). Ya anyways, that last time I had a friend was in middle school and it wasn’t even one of those really really close friends where you’re like sisters and can tell each other everything, I’ve never had that close or comfortable of a friendship/relationship with anyone. I don’t know why I can’t form connections like that with others, it must be me tho, right? Because it seems like everyone else has somebody so I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. Even tho me and that girl weren’t the closest friends ever, she was the best friend I’ve ever had and I miss her terribly. I could always move back to where my friends were when I’m old enough(which is a couple months away) even though i don’t talk to any of them, but people change and I’m afraid that they’re not going to like who I am now and I’ll be right back to where I am right now. Wanting to die. 

When people say they want to die everyone’s always like “you have so much to live for” n stuff like that but I really don’t. I’m bad at school, I’m bad at connecting with people, I’m bad at being social and outgoing, I don’t have any goals or dreams of what I want to do with the rest of my life, I know I don’t have to have my whole future planned out but I feel like I’m so far behind everyone else my age. I don’t think I’d be a good mom, I don’t even think I want kids at all, I don’t think I want to be married either and my family says that because of that, there’s definitely something wrong with me. 


I have more things to say or write about I guess but this is already super long, messy, and not written very well so sorry. Thank you.",17Mar2020,1
15,"Throwaway account because I don't want my family to find out I wrote this.

I (M, 20) have really been struggling with depression and anxiety for the past five years although I think I've felt really sad and out of place ever since I started school. I have Asperger's syndrome and I was always a lonely child. It didn't help that because I don't understand social cues it can sometimes make it really difficult for me to read a room. Just to clarify Asperger's is not in anyway an excuse for rude and unkind behavior and I still feel really guilty about several unkind things I said in high school. I sometimes wonder if I can ever get past it? If I can ever be clean and innocent again? But then again I guess I should have not said those things in the first place. 

But my biggest source of sadness and loneliness is the fact that I don't have a girlfriend? I can never attract a girl and I really feel terrible about that. I sometimes just lie on my bed for hours just feeling sorry for myself and dreaming about the day some nice girl will not only listen to me but also kiss me in mid sentence and let me cry my eyes out. And whenever she was sad I'd do the same to her (I would comfort her the way she would want to be comforted). I know I'm not entitled to any girl but i still feel angry at myself and constantly feel like the fact that I don't have a girlfriend is because I'm a selfish, narcissistic, stupid, awkward ugly freak. But I'm scared to get into a relationship because I'm afraid that I'll treat her less than she deserves to be treated. Act like I have all the problems and neglect hers and all the good things she does. I feel too scared to talk to girls I like. And when I finally pluck up the courage they're already with some other guy. I feel really sad and incomplete without a girlfriend but I know I'm not mentally in the right place to be in a relationship ATM. How can I take my mind off of it and when will I know I'm ready? Also what's the best way to approach a relationship when I am? Remember I have Asperger's so I have no clue. 

Another thing is that I have no choice at the moment but to live with my family who are super religious. They're Mormon and up until a year ago I sincerely believed in it too. But then I realized it didn't make any sense, I was appalled by it's continued backwards stances on LGBTQ issues (which I'm absolutely ashamed to say  I once bought but I promise you that I know better now and I always try to call out my church family and friends when they say something ignorant or bigoted even though they don't always want to hear it) and just in general felt really unhappy with it's strict rules. One that really impacted me was that you are not supposed to have sexual relations outside of marriage. And that includes your thoughts as well (for as Jesus said any man that seeketh in his thoughts to commit adultery hath already done it or something like that) and so that includes things like pornography and masturbation. Ever since I was twelve I would always go to the bathroom after succumbing to a bit of self love where I would always check the underwear for semen stains and if I would find a single spot I would feel so worthless because then I knew that I had sinned and so was ""unworthy"" to do my ""sacred"" priesthood duty (which you are expected to do as a boy beginning at age 12. The Mormon church doesn't allow girls to have the priesthood) and I felt like I was letting my family, my church and my God down. 

I love my parents and I always will even after all they did to me in instilling that mindset. But it still is annoying living with them and all their strict rules. For example even though I'm twenty I can't watch R rated movies. I can't even watch movies with swearing or sexual innuendos in them. Given that I'm going to have to self isolate for maybe a year, who knows, it's particularity frustrating. Then again it's all I've done my whole life so I should be well used to it by now. But it infuriates me that whenever I ask them about lifting the standards for me when I watch movies or TV shows in my own time they're response is always ""I guess we haven't been good parents if you want to watch movies like that.""  The only university they've let me go to is BYU Idaho online which has a lot of these same standards (they don't even allow students to be openly gay or trans) and you're expected to keep your mouth shut or you risk failing the ""honor code."" And that includes me having to lie and say that I not only believe in the church but that I also don't watch porn or jerk off. Otherwise I won't be allowed to graduate. I'm not even studying on campus. For the past three years I've been forced to study online which is so lonely while I have to absorb (otherwise interesting classes) with the church's filthy propaganda. Unsurprisingly they constantly gaslight you and I'm scared of caving back into them. I'm also constantly stressed out about being wrong about leaving the church one day and that I'll go to hell. 

I'm worried about leaving the church because I know it'll break my parents hearts. I have full confidence that they'll always accept me no matter what I do (they really are good parents). But It'll be hard because I know for a fact that if I leave the rest of my siblings will leave too. The culture of the Mormon church unfortunately drills into your head that if your children left the church it was because you were a bad parent.

One more thing in regards to my mental health. The workload of my classes are killing me. I constantly procrastinate but it's mostly because I bottle so much up (I have no friends to talk about this stuff too) and it really hurts my ability to concentrate. I usually do well at school but I feel terrible because I don't do as well as I feel like I should. And I constantly doubt myself because I had a ""friend"" who whenever I tried sharing my opinion and he disagreed with me he'd yell at me that I was ""retarded"" (he knew I was autistic but I don't know if he meant it that way) and that ""people like me deserve to die"" (I'm glad I never told him about my suicidal thoughts). And whenever I confronted him about it he would say ""I couldn't take a joke."" I don't think he meant those insults but it still screws my head up today and it was even more hurtful when my own brother (who I love dearly) sided with him over me and he would bring it up whenever he thought I was being overly sensitive (otherwise my brother is a great guy but sometimes he can be very thoughtless). I'm just tired of being a doormat.

Thank you to everyone who read the whole of this. I feel a lot better now. Please note that currently I can't afford therapy and my parents only want me seeing church therapists (some of which are surprisingly very good but there are still things that I'm comfortable talking to them about). But I'll save up for one someday.

But does anyone have any advice?",17Mar2020,1
16,"I've been depressed for years, but I was only diagnosed two years ago by a doctor. I got therapy and medication, however I stopped it all because I moved too far from where I was getting treatment. I know I should have continued it but a part of me was lazy, and I felt hopeless. I've been off medication for 6 months now and my emotions are getting bad. When I was depressed and someone made me sad, i would just sulk around all day and lay in bed. However, when someone makes me mad now I develop horrible anger issues. At the moment they're very uncontrollable, but thankfully I am still at a state where I can prevent myself from taking action. I've thought of doxxing, beating, wishing death, and sometimes even killing people whenever someone does something bad to me. Instead of being upset I just get violently angry and I can see what's happening and I want it to stop because I feel like I'm not me anymore. I grew up being very timid and shy, never took action, never stood up for myself and I think that anger has been building up for so long. I feel like a bomb waiting to go off. I just want advice on how to control these emotions. I am in college and I would go to the counseling center but school is closed for the next few weeks.

23,"Hi, first of all sorry for using a TW account. I just need to let my feelings out before I explode. 

There is a song that used to console me, saying how spring will come - and with it a better mood. I have been waiting for years to feel even remotely happy. My depression has been with me ever since I can remember and although my family tried to understand no one ever realised how bad it really is.

I moved abroad nearly 5 years ago, went through major trauma but ended up luckily stabilising my life to a point about 2 years in. I initially loved it, had some brief drug encounters etc.

Nowadays I spend my days locked inside, unhappy unless I look like a perfect doll, dealing with an eating disorder and major insecurity complex. There is no way I will leave my apartment unless I feel immaculate. I have tried multiple ADs, but nothing had long lasting effects. Therapy never worked for me and I have no real friends that I can talk to. The only time I feel happy is after starving myself/binging or drinking at least a litre of wine (I am luckily able to restrict these harmful habits, but I feel dead without them). As much as I love my family we have a certain limit that we simply don’t cross. Feelings were never really considered, even as a child.

It has been incredibly difficult to even continue living lately. I don’t want to end my life, but I can’t keep going. It’s so difficult to just keep breathing. 

Even when it gets better it’s never for long. I tired recovering from my eating disorder (made my mental health worse), being spontaneous (caused major anxiety), talking to people (rejection because people felt uncomfortable).

I have no idea how to keep going and simply want to fall asleep while never waking up - but I am also terrified.

I don’t feel like living, but fear the unknown of death. I feel like I am in a limbo. I don’t deserve to exist. And yet I waste space in a 1st world country moping around while someone else deserves my space is much more.

The thoughts of ending it all consume my mind more and more very day, I stress about my existence and future. I BEG you - please help me realise why this isn’t ok.",17Mar2020,1
24,"I feel like it’s my fault. I’ve been really depressed for about a year. Basically since I cheated on my last girlfriend. I’ve never felt worse than the look my ex gave me when I told her the next day and it’s been haunting me for a while. 

The girl I ended things with today, let’s call her Jane, was in my friend group when I cheated on my previous Ex, let’s call her Jill. Jane was among the handful of my friends that didn’t treat me like shit when they found out, cause it kind of blew up in the whole group.  

Half of them were on her side, saying that I was shitty to do that and they didn’t know if they could trust me as a friend anymore. They told me I didn’t deserve Jill in my life or as I friend and I should consider myself lucky that she still was willing to be my friend. Which honestly I didn’t want to associate with her at all anymore but I was too scared of what would happen if I acknowledged that fact to admit it.

The other half were pretty much on my side, and saw that I had been in a mentally straining and toxic relationship with someone who refused to get help for their depression and anxiety, and after her manipulating me back into the relationship the first time I broke up with her (1 week before I cheated) I was desperate for a way out of the relationship. Jane was among those friends. Those friends didn’t like that I cheated on her but they were much more understanding and much less condemning.

I don’t disagree with either side of that dramatic situation. I hate myself every day for doing that to her. I spent over a year in that relationship trying my best to be supportive and to empathize with what Jill was dealing with mentally, but it got to a point where she started projecting her feelings about herself onto me. That’s where it got really toxic. (Of course it took a lot of time and therapy to realize that’s what was happening)

After we broke up the second time Jill was still a part of my life, I think because she wasn’t fully ready to let me out of hers, so she was saying things like “you owe it to me to be my friend” and “give me closure”. And honestly I thought she was right. But I pried myself further and further away from her, spending more time with the Jane and the friends who still talked to me. Eventually, Jill dropped out of school. 

I think that’s something I still blame myself for. 

I know consciously that she didn’t need to be in college. She was skipping classes, constantly fighting with her parents over the phone about how she wanted to go home, and they would tell her she couldn’t. She had to stay in school and get a degree. They said if she wasn’t in school they weren’t gonna let her live with them. But despite those signs that she was bound to drop out anyway, I feel like it was my fault. 

Because I know she would have stayed in school if we were still dating. 

I know that she would have stayed an extra 2, 3, 4 semesters past her expected graduation date, retaking the same classes that she was always skipping. And I would have been suffering in a relationship that was making me hate myself. 

But at least she would have stayed in school. 

It was really hard when I found out she left, and that’s when I started emotionally disconnecting from myself and the people around me. I wasn’t able to open up. I was even shielding to my therapist. Finding ways to make it seem like I was talking about what bothered me without actually addressing what I was holding against myself. It got to the point where I believed myself and the fact that I was doing good and getting help and having friends and talking to Jane. Me and Jane starting talking and getting to know each other. 

And sleeping together. 

We were friends with benefits for the first three or four months after Jill and I broke up, starting a few weeks after the break up. Except we didn’t want our friends to know cause we thought they would think badly of us for doing stuff together so soon after both getting out of a relationship. So I was leaving their apartment where we would all hang out, walking out the door saying “goodnight, see y’all tomorrow” and then climbing into her window three seconds later. 

We were having fun, sleeping with other people keeping it casual, and then we started getting feelings. That’s when the “mom” of the friend group caught on. Or at least told us. She probably knew for a while. She told us it was “unfair” to her and the other friends because we were being “dishonest” with them. I guess. Idk. But it shouldn’t have been up to her what we get to do or who we tell about it. She disagreed. She (Mom friend) said that last time Jane was in a relationship she lost the boy she broke up with as a friend. What really happened is she stopped trying to reach out to him because of HER depression and anxiety and pushed him away. But that’s nomb. 

Anyway, because mom friend reacted so badly to us doing the dirty, we told her we would stop and continued to do it in secret. 

Bad idea, we should have said f you we will f if we want. But we didn’t. 

Moving on. 

Towards the end of the year, me and Jane were spending a lot of time together away from the main group, and started to catch feelings. We considered ourselves “talking” and made the relationship exclusive. 

Summer 2019

I hope y’all are enjoying, this shit has turned into a novel 

I, for some reason, decided to share a two person apartment with mom friend. Smh. Two depressed persons who have some buried resentment for each other under the same roof. What could go wrong. 

I would make trips to see Jane without telling mom friend where I was going, which made me act sus and I started to thing she was sus, which made me more sus. I have know idea what or if she knew. That made me more anxious because I had a whole relationship I was trying to keep secret from the person I lived with. That was hard. Then, halfway through the summer, my grandma was admitted to the hospital. 

Her liver cancer was getting worse. 

She was diagnosed in January of that year and we slowly lost her more and more each month. So I was in and out of school, going to visit her and my family, on top of all that shit that happened that semester, adding to more emotional disconnection. 

I refused to let myself feel any of the feelings my environment was inciting out of fear of complete mental breakdown 

My Grandma passed away in July of 2019 

I didn’t talk to a single person from school for a week, including Jane. 

At the end of the week, after the memorial service, I called Jane and told her I didn’t think I needed a relationship because I felt really mentally unstable and couldn’t be present in one. Things were weird, I was single for about two months, the longest time since I started dating in like 2016. 

Then school started back up in august and literally as soon as I saw Jane again I felt like I messed up by breaking up with her. Idk if I did. But we broke up again today so who’s to say. 

I’ve kind of said it all so to make that last semester short, I got more depressed, decided to drop out and now I’m home. Me and Jane tried to make it work from a distance, I visited a few times, she visited a couple times, and as time went on I got more and more distant in the relationship. 

I stopped being responsive during phone calls, one to two word answers, and it was hard for me to respond to texts. Today we finally had a serious conversation about it and decided it was best for both of us to end it. That was a few hours ago and I’ve been getting strong waves of depressive feelings since. 

I guess what I wanted from typing all this is someone who might understand. Or relate. Or be willing to give their two cents. I feel like shit and I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. I wanna feel like myself again. Or at least close. 

TL:DR read the whole thing it took forever to type and honestly I got a little closure from it. Skim if you want",17Mar2020,1
25,"The title isn’t clickbait. That’s exactly how I feel 
I’m relatively new to reddit so don’t bully me too much lmao. 
I’m 21(f), relatively fair attraction. 5’7” and kind of a chubby/thick. I’m aware I have major self esteem issues but I’m not horribly ugly or anything. 
My deal is i need the attention of everyone, male or female, and I CRAVE validation. Doesn’t matter who you are, what gender, age, or level of attraction. I think about what sex would be like with nearly everyone I encounter around my age and older. If someone flirts with me, I’m not one to turn them down even if they are being disrespectful. This, of course, has hindered my relationships in the past. It all comes down to the fact that I’m a “whore”, I have no “self worth” but I’m aware of it (This is what past partners have said but that isn’t far from the truth tbh). 
Honestly some of the time I don’t even want sex, I just crave the feeling of being wanted and validated. I want men to drool over me, I want my body to be seen as an object. Doesn’t matter if I’m in a relationship or not. Y’all can roast me but also I’m looking for advice or any reddit diagnosis lmao. I really should not be acting the way that I do. I’ve talked to my therapist about other things but never this. I’m repulsed by my own behavior and mind which is why I’m embarrassed to admit it all. Help.",17Mar2020,1
26,"In psych hospitals they chain you to a bed in a cement room and inject you with so many drugs you are left unconscious and drooling for days. Zombified.

They would even drug the food in the prison-like hospitals.

The Psychiatry Industry obviously works with big pharma and connections to the government.

My theory about them is that they are drugging peoples foods until they display abnormal symptoms, then imprison them in a ""mental hospital"" to ""help"" them.

But that's just the cover up.

They then test experimental drugs on the patients. Poison, essentially.

You think something that would help you would make you twitch, drool, decrease focus and concentration, barely keep your eyes open, and in some cases cause sudden death?

Essentially MK-Ultra reincarnated.

Of course the government has eyes everywhere, I'm sure that's why they have people following me around. I can see them.

My school keeps people trailing me, just waiting a chance to snatch me if I display any abnormal behavior. Thankfully I hardly ever leave the house anyways lol.

I can never escape them, I'm surely on a watch list now.

One of the worse parts is that they've managed to brainwash people into thinking that they actually help, and people like me that see the truth are crazy.

So, I'm just hoping by sending this out there other people will finally open their eyes or relate.",17Mar2020,1

My mind is at a civil war with its self, one that has the ideals of class and the simple fact of knowing better the other half longing for madness, fun ,and sin. Its wanting to declare its own independence for my brain.  I get a stroke of jealousy from others with a passionate hatred and disrespectful for myself each day. Especially for a certain boy in school which I can never seem to run away from. I love him more than anything in the world, and if I could buy his love for a million dollars I would. But at the same time he seems to be a sort of arch nemesis to me.  he goes gallivanting off with his friends every day, with me being jealous from a distance that I can't join them. I have had a crush on him for almost 4 years now he seems so fun, and yet I still hear things about him that I hate. The way that he is controlling and is a "" Do things my way because I all way get my way"" type. Also because he seems to lack any sort of common sense.  Just the other day I had heard from a friend of mine that he had been "" Played for nudes"" by some 20 year old guy on the internet. The only thoughts in my head at that time was ""does that Piano Boy have any sort of brains in his head"". But I'm so emotionally attached to him that if something were to happen to him I would go insane. My life is so muddled up that I cant even verbally explained all the things that I need help with. But for now I will leave asking, ""How can I help myself"" and ""how can I get myself out of this unhealthy emotional attachment that I have to my friend"".

28,"Hi, this is my first Reddit post ever, so if it is messed up...my bad. Ok, so I would be doing an activity such as basketball or drawing or video editing. Then questions would start to appear. Like while I am video editing, I would ask questions like...""How can I make this a good looking edit"", then I would think like ""What makes something look good to the human brain"", then when I get an answer to the question it doesn't satisfy me. Another example, was when I was playing basketball a question popped up saying ""How does you know how to shoot without thinking"", and obviously the answer is because of muscle memory, but then another question would be like ""What is muscle memory"" ""What is a muscle"", Just dumb question that hinders my well-being. It is so weird and straining. Like for example, let's say someone asked""Why does painting look better than another one"", the regular answer would be ""Because it does, it just looks nice"". That answer wouldn't satisfy my brain for some reason. I would do tons of research on why certain people like certain things, to where I would go into brain chemistry and wiring and everything, and it still wouldn't satisfy me. Imagine basically never finding the answer to a question, and constantly trying to find it. But, it is like I DO KNOW THE ANSWER, but my brain won't shut up with the questions.

30,"I've been getting more and more far from reality lately. Doing shit and not worrying about the consequences. The moment I got my first paycheck I went out and bought airpods despite the fact I have an android phone, leaving 50 cents in my bank account. I'd do this often in video games and shit, but I always thought real money would carry more weight to it and so I would be more careful. I've already made a lineup of stuff on amazon I'm planning to buy.

Then I realized I had a rbc client card. It has no expiration date, no cvv. I can't order stuff online. I was up until 1 am last night trying to find some way to order the stuff I wanted off amazon. I was so very disappointed. Then rbc glitched out and was giving me error codes all night. This morning it finally starts working and guess what. I have to go to a rbc location to get a card. And wait like a month for it to come in the mail.

So then I started looking at the items in the phone store near me and of course they have nothing. The longer I wait the more money I will have. I promised myself I will just buy a phone and case and stuff and that will be it. But the longer I have to wait the more money I will have saved up. Which means chances are I will buy some crazy expensive phone rather than the cheap one I was planning to buy with just the money from my next paycheck.

So here's how things will turn out. I will have airpods, a way overpowered phone I have no need for. And who's to say it will stop after that. I may go the rest of my life being unable to stop myself from buying. I'll have 0 dollars in my bank account walking around with gucci on airpods in and an iphone 11 pro plus. I'll look rich, but that'll only be because I spent all my money. And I will be sad in the end.",17Mar2020,1
31,"Hi,

I am curious about the weight gain side effect with Lithium.  Does it affect metabolism or insulin?  Cause water retention?  Or does it simply increase hunger?  

I was on Mirtazipine which is notorious for weight gain.  I gained about 25 pounds on it over. Months but was able to get it all off and keep it off (while still taking it) by not giving into cravings (which was very difficult at first).  Mirtazipine made me crave carbs like crazy for whatever reason.

Can you keep the weight off if you are disciplined when taking Lithium?  Or is it like some antipsychotics that affect metabolism, insulin, kidney function and/or cause water retention etc.

Thanks to any and all responses!",17Mar2020,1
32,"I'm no expert about this first. But, I followed news about this from the early january. I have seen videos from china, had a clue it will turn into a pandamic.
So, first if all in china. Death rate was around 3700 for I guess 60,000-70,000 cases. I have read posts about individuals getting recovered easily. It's scary. But, you probably won't die. Millions of people in china where under lockdown. Since, I knew about this from long time but looks like rest of the world is reacting now. 
Look your body's immunity is the cure. Best you can do, is sleep, eat, excercise. I understand it's scary in the beginning but weeks later it feels like old news and you will ignore it. I'm so sick of reading it everywhere honestly. My mental state is at like I die, I die ( which probably will not) I'm pissed at how so called world leaders handled it more than anything.
Precautions: I don't know what western media is telling you all. You gotta wear masks, goggles. Gloves and disinfect phones, clothes. 
If u can stay home don't even bother going out. It's not worth it. 
Things to do : learn a new language ( i'm learning spanish ), binge watch a show. Talk to your friends.
Remember times when u wanted a holiday so bad. Relax, it's not the end of world or you. Many people in china according to the news/videos I have seen got better in their home. [ immunity, doctors can't help ]

Things started about four years ago when I began living with my mom. I had never lived with her so things were a little rough at first because we weren't used to being in the same household but I felt as though things would get better with time. Things were good but then this year they got a lot worse. It seemed like we were always getting into disagreements and never really getting along. It has gotten to the point where I don't even want to be around her anymore.

I've tried to tell her how I feel about things but then she gets even more mad or says ""this generation is too soft"", so I have stopped telling her how I feel about anything. I don't want to ask her for therapy because I feel like she will use that against me. I also am an only child so I really have no one to confide in. All of my family members support me tremendously, however they don't really know whats going on. My uncle is the only one who she tells anything to and he tries to tell her to calm down and see things from my perspective but then she gets mad at him and finds a way to turn it back on me.

40,"I went on a trip abroad for four months. Everything was going ok, I was having a pretty good time and having fun. 

However, one day, I was in the car with some friends when an elk crossed the road while we were on a highway, forcing the driver to turn rapidly to the left. The co-pilot thought we were about to get into the opposite side of the road and into a ditch (which wasn’t true), but out of instinct he pulled the driver’s wheel to the right side violently, causing the car to lose control and fall down the road into a small hill. The car skidded because of the snow and then processed to roll over four times. 

I hit my head against the window and I remember distinctly feeling a wet drip coming from my head. I touched it once the car stopped rolling and thought it was blood. 

When we got out I saw I had instead hit an airbag and the thing that was dripping was melted snow that had gotten in from one of the windows. I was fine except for a small bump in my head. We all made it with small scratches and not much else. The EMT’s checked us and said there were no signs of concussion and that we were lucky and fine. 

After that however, I felt like things around me started to become “bad”. People that were close to me became distant, work became unbearable and I started to feel alone. All around me things began to change. I felt as if I was in that tv show “the good place”, because all I felt around me was manageable pain, but pain nonetheless. 

After that, I felt like it took an eternity to fly back home to my country. Time went by slowly and the things and people that made me happy were distant and cold, until they stopped hanging out with me. I didn’t understand why and I would constantly question myself what was going on.

Family members began to get sick and all I could do was watch from afar. It was torture. I thought I would have to prepare myself to never see them again. Every single day I would wake up and expect a message saying they were gone. Thankfully they were not. But it drained all the life out of me. And to make it worse, I had no one to talk about it and it made my job performance drop which made my job a whole lot more hellish. 

Things got a little better eventually and then the whole Coronavirus thing explored. I had to get an emergency flight two weeks before I was supposed to leave and it was so rushed (I booked my flight and had 3 hours to get everything ready) that I forgot tons of important things. 

My country closed down the borders 12 hours after my flight got in. I didn’t thing I would make it. I thought I would have to go back and continue living this solitary torture. I just couldn’t believe it when I landed. 

Now, I am finally home with my family. But now I can’t shake off this feeling that if I go to sleep I’ll wake up back to the country I was in and realise it was all but a dream and I am still stuck perpetually in that hell of a place. I am so happy to be home, I don’t want it to be over. Sometimes I just don’t understand how I survived that crash so it comes to reason I think I didn’t and I am just in the Purgatory. I am so afraid to go back there I can’t even start to feel sleepy. My heart is racing and all I want to do is cry. 

Am I alive? Am I dead? Is there any way to know? What is happening to me? How do I take this feeling away?

I don't remember if I did anything else. At the time I had a feeling that it was weird but my mom didn't discourage it. I eventually stopped doing it because I felt ashamed by it.

Now I'm an adult (23) and there are sometimes where I see photos of a cute animal or I see a cute stuffed animal and I get an intense urge to start talking and acting like a baby.

43,"Hello. Trying to find a way to explain this.  First information about me.  I'm a 21 year old male university student with depression and anxiety issues.  I have little to no friends and spend most of my time alone.  I often struggle with my loneliness.  This post isn't about me.  It's about my friend.  

I met her in highschool and for whatever reason decided to be vulnerable and get close to her.  Tell her about my problems I've told nobody about.  As you may have pieced together by now, I had a crush on her.  Overtime I learned she has mental health issues as well to a much higher magnitude. Eventually, due to the stress that it caused to keep my feelings to myself, I told her.  She understood, but stated she was in a relationship.  There must have been a miscommunication or new developement I didn't know about, because I thought she was single.  Anyways didn't take it to great.  I didn't lash out or anything, but felt the extreme need to distance myself.  I didn't expect us to get together, but knowing she was with someone made me weird.  Anyways graduation rolls around and I decide to make a run for it and just disappear.  However, I could never bring myself to get rid of her contact info.

Fast forward sophomore year.  We go to different universities in different states.  At this point I think about her from time to time and still haven't completely gotten past everything.  For whatever reason I contact her thanking her for the support in highschool and apologizing for acting weird towards the end.  She says it's ok.  However, things have gotten worse for her.  I don't think it's my place to go into specific detail, but know that it gets bad enough for hospitalization rather frequently.  Anyways I say I'm sorry and tell her that I'm here if she needs it.  She says thanks, but I don't hear from her after.  Figure if she needs me she'll contact me.

Fast forward 8 or so months and I get a message.  Wants to see how I'm doing.  We get to talking and it's getting worse.  Out impulse I tell her we should start talking regularly.  We start to and after a while I start to get the full scope of how bad it was.  I start to check up on her regularly.  Her issues often make it hard for her to communicate consistently, so I am the one who reaches out a good 99% of the time.  It's been this way getting close to a year now.  My old feelings start flaring up.  

Now onto the issue.  I find the whole situation difficult.  Trying to be there emotionally for her when I sometimes don't hear anything for weeks at a time.  How to be there for her.  Being the one that exclusively reaches out.  I often find myself repeating ""I'm sorry that happened"" on loop.  She tells me she appreciates me and that I'm not a nuisance (after asking).  She says she's probably just as open to me to her therapist, if not more so, but I feel a distance between us I can't shake.  I often wonder if I call or text to much.  I apologize for this, but she says she's ok with it and that it's on her for not responding.  Have I mentioned I haven't physically seen her in almost 3 years.  And yes I have brought up my feelings.  Of course she said that she's in no condition for a relationship, which was to be expected.  I mainly told her for my own sanity.  Still told her I want to be there for her (don't want a repeat of highschool).  So there it all is.  I'm probably not going to get alot of advice or am breaking some sub rule and the post will get deleted.  Either way that's all of it.",17Mar2020,1

Now that the outbreak has happened, it feels like the end of the world. I have plans that have been upended totally, my job opportunity is in jeopardy because of the impending shutdown of society. I've also been obsessing about how Ive seemingly not be successful enough and I'm afraid i will never have enough opportunity to advance my carrier. I don't know, it has ignited a total panic for the future and i just need people to talk to.

The world is a super fucked up place full of 99% fucked up people and they think they're going to change that by not offering enough help and letting us die off. They aren't losing any sleep about my pain and suffering and likely inevitable premature death from mental and physical illness. All I needed was someone to care about me and help pick me up off my ass. And I could have been a productive member of society and hell, possibly have even gone on to use my brain to do great things. What they dont realize is they're not just killing off the most mentally ill among us, they're killing off the most intelligent also. And those aren't just delusions of grandeur. So many people are mentally ill *because* they're smarter and more aware of how shitty and fucked up the world is. I'm really stupid in a lot of ways considering my inability to pick myself up and take care of myself. Now I'm 99.99999% certain I have cancer that has spread like wildfire, and a whole plethora of other physical and mental illnesses. And it sucks and hurts so badly. But I'm just too afraid to go out and try to get help. Then there's studies that **DOCTORS ARE THE #3 LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH!** Think about that for a moment!! Think about how bad you have to be to be responsible for killing as many people as car accidents and heart attacks and shit! Plus if I step outside I'll catch a disease that will somehow fuck me up even worse than I already am and then I'll REALLY die even sooner and more painfully than I'm already about to. Its just so sad. I could've done great things. But the government doesnt want people who require resources. They want people who SUPPLY services and resources. I probably have my own FBI agent watching my every online move to try to catch me doing anything they can lock me up for. Imagine if they put forth this much effort to help make me better and turn me into a productive member of society. The things I could do and achieve..but nope. I'm mentally ill and full of unbridled rage and if I were to reproduce then it would likely just be another mentally ill loser like me and they cant risk that so it's easier to just let me die off. Fuck this world is so sad and fucked up. If theres a god hes one sick SOB lmao. Fml. 
How could we use our brains to come together and overcome the system that wants so badly for us to fail and die off? Cuz I know we're mostly depressed and anxious and unmotivated, but if overcoming our evil and malevolent overlords who are rooting for our demise isnt enough to motivate me then idk what is. What can we do? Create a website/forum with the goal of truly progressive deliberation for everyone? How can we ensure no man gets left behind like so many of us are everyday?

50,"Part 1:

When I look at you, I still see the freshly 20-year-old, outgoing, charismatic young man who carefully gained possession of what was left of my almost non-existent trust and fragile, teenage heart 13-years-ago. I still see the confident smile that belonged to a rambunctious boy who knew the world was full of possibility and opportunity, and he could conquer any obstacles that lay in his path. That smile... oh... that smile 😌 it melted so many hearts, and I’m so lucky to be the ONE woman who is still able to coax it out of hiding from time-to-time.

You are the man who saved my life more times than I can confess and the person who’s pure and beautiful soul I have been blessed to be able to create and build my life with. You are the devoted, adoring and incredibly nurturing father to our three magnificent children. You are my kindred soul... the universes answer to my life’s purpose... and... my darling... believe me when I say that I would be LOST without you...

I love you. Not in the truism sense of the word. Not because that’s what we, as humans, have been conditioned to tell someone with whom we show adoration toward... NO...I am chemically and cosmically connected to the fabric of your immortal energy. My spirit requires you... I NEED you in the same way I need air to breath and water to drink. You are my soul’s sustenance.

So that’s why... on the day when you tried to kill your self, 3-weeks-ago... I felt like a vital part of me died. For weeks, I have felt like I have been living with a stranger and I haven’t known how to look at you or even what to say. Not because I love you any less, but because I haven’t been able to understand how you could have gotten to that place where you felt so bombarded by your own mind you were forced to pushed every primal, human instinct to survive away and KNEW you needed to permanently escape. It breaks my heart to think about the agony you must have gone trough to get to that place where you felt like it was time to leave this earth, this life, our family and our love. I feel so guilty that I, your closest and most intimate friend in this world, never saw the signs and couldn’t be there to save you from yourself.

I’m so, incredibly lucky to still have you with me, and I’m trying my best to understand how that beautifully complicated mind of yours functions. I know you’re not ready to talk about it, but I would hope that you would forgive me for seeking advice from other’s who might also suffer from Paranoid Schizophrenia, so I can gain a better understanding of how you are wired and how I can be there for you now and everyday in our future...

I love you, baby and I am HERE FOR YOU... as long as we both shall live...

PART TWO
12/27/2019

We are growing accustomed to celebrating the small victories we have encountered over these last few, unexplainably difficult months. I like to think this kind of behavior has been therapeutic for your increasingly more fragile mind. It feels incredible to witness you smile on occasion and... my love... today is Friday and the kids are asleep.

It’s time to celebrate US... this rare connection we have. Our deep friendship and kindredness that has given you and I the strength to survive the ravishing fires of hell. Tonight... All we need is you and me in our purest and most honest forms, this old couch that’s certainly seen it’s share of better days, a couple of cheap beers and a music playlist that is rich with adolescent memories - those few years of our lives we had to struggle through alone. The years before I found you and we weren’t lucky enough to have loved one another...YET...

We require this moment where nothing is expected of us. Just a few hours when nothing outside of this toy and cheerio covered living room is of any concern to our collective psyche. We have earned this sliver of time to take all of our stress and anxiety acquired through the years and store it, for a few moments, away from our present minds - somewhere it can’t weigh on our cerebrum. And when our chests finally feel a bit lighter, It’s time to forget today, forget last week, forget last year and remember the tiny moments and coincidences that brought us to one another. It’s time to dive deep into each other’s lives and emerge from the depths as stronger and more learned version of ourselves. These minuscule clips of time seem to pass so quickly, but I know we are better for them.

Did you know that I love that you can still surprise me. I adore that you are still here to spend this moment with me, to share our truths and experiences tonight. I am fascinated by your life. Your story is an intoxicating book that I can’t put down. You are the most incredible human who has ever walked this earth and I’m genuinely grateful to be the one who gets to walk beside you, dance with you, and fall asleep in the comfort and security of your sturdy arms.

Words tend to flow from me freely when I’m in your presence because I know you’re the only person who has ever fully accepted and loved me as I am - in my rawest form - even my ugliest and most vulnerable versions. I love that you are habitually honest with me, even when the truth is both difficult speak and digest. I need you to remain this truthful with me, ALWAYS. I may not, in every scenario, know what to say or do with your truths, but I promise you that I can carry more emotional weight than you think me capable of, and your secrets are safest when harbored with me.

Laying next to you tonight, I was sorry to hear that your mind orchestrated delusions have become more negative and terrifying over the course of the past month. It’s hard to imagine the fear you experience when you wake up in the middle of the night to a faceless demon aggressively attempting to infiltrate our home and harm our children. I don’t know what it’s like to have an independent, entity narrate my life, boss me around, bully and break me down mentally and tell me that my time is almost over...

It broke my heart to hear you confess that you had planned to take your own life the day prior, because you thought it was the only way to make the unwanted haunting images, apparitions and disembodied voices leave you forever. It crushed me to learn that you had already begun your goodbyes to our children. Though, what confuses me most is why you believe that your strength and honesty are things you need to apologize for. I’m ecstatic that you love me enough to muster your strength in this moment with me today and I admire your courage to be honest about your waking nightmares. Its important for me to understand what you are going through so I can know how to help you navigate through this horror show spectacle.

I promised you, the day we fell in love, that you would never have to face this life alone. I have no intentions of breaking that promise now.

I’m still trying to process all of this. Its a bit overwhelming to digest this instant because It devastates me to know that you spend the majority of your days petrified in fear and polarized by anxiety. I wish there was something I could do to take that burden away from you. I’m not sure what those magic words are that will make all of your pain disappear...

That’s why I remained silent tonight and cried with you instead...

PART THREE
01/01/2020

Happy New Year, My Love!

I’m thankful to have had a 13th opportunity to kiss your gorgeous lips at the stroke of Midnight - Ringing in another New Year the way we always have. What would I do without you here beside me? Where and Who would I be without your influence on my emotional growth? I hazard to assume that I would DO nothing productive, BE nothing and go nowhere without you. You are my divine inspiration to exist...

Cliche as it may sound, I unquestionably slept as soundly as an infant, buried in your arms last night. Your scent, warmth and the weight of your body filled my dreams with pleasant, carefree imageries and I was excited to wake up beside you this morning.

Much to my dismay, the hopeful man I fell asleep with last night was not the same man I woke up next to today. The man I woke up with today was pale faced, trembling and petrified. He cried despairingly while gripping his skull and desperately pleaded with a hallucinatory force... Repeating his dissuasive mantra, “Please Stop.” “Stop.” “Please Go Away.”

I placed my hand on his back in an effort to calm him down. I rubbed him gently and repeatedly shushed and assured him that the voice he was hearing wasn’t real and everything would be alright. His anxiety consumed him entirely and caused him to spiral downward, in and out of reality, trying desperately to maintain his grip on his own physical existence. His personal desires and conscious thought became muffled beneath the howl of a sinister cacodemon that wasn’t actually there... 

I stayed beside the man I woke up with for the next two hours. Fearful myself, at times, hoping he would let my husband come back home to me soon. I sat, holding him tightly on my bathroom floor, as his fear caused him to violently purge every ounce of matter that existed within his gut. I began to shake uncontrollably as I held him firmly around the chest and calmly talked him down from repeated moments of hyperventilation and near panic induced shock...

He told me his angriest delusion doesn’t like me. He held me gently by the face and assured me that he would never hurt me, even though the voice in his head has been ordering him to, “SLIT HER FUCKING CUNT THROAT!” I told him I knew he would never hurt me... and then I ordered him to leave! 

I grabbed the bottle of antipsychotics that you have been neglecting to consume the past few weeks and forced him to digest one. I waited for several minutes that seemed more like centuries for you to come home to me. I watched his eyes transition from a tormented shade of dark grey to the beautiful, pale green eyes of the man I fell in live with. You collapsed downward, overwhelmed with joy and relief, as you found your way back into my shaken embrace, and tears poured from our eyes as you exclaimed, “he’s gone... I’m so happy he’s gone.” 

You are taking your meds regularly again, and we are sticking to our care plan. We had to learn a vital lesson in a terrifying fashion, but I can’t be more proud of your strength to persevere through all of this madness. 

You are the strongest person I have ever known, darling and I love you...

Let’s keep moving forward together. 

PART FOUR
03/16/20

If I wasn’t the one holding you tightly around your chest, calmly telling you how to breath and coaching down from a catastrophic panic, who would do that for you? Lately it seems like we are all each other has... no one really understands this. How could they? 

Do you know what scares me? The thought of having to do all of this nonsense without my best friend. It’s actually terrifying to not know if you’re going to be here tomorrow. How am I supposed to go about doing any of this without you? 

And there’s nothing I can say to make you want to stay here with me. Your pain is beyond my vocabulary and it breaks me into pieces to have to watch you go through the motions...
Struggling In a world where literally no one understands or even attempts to level with you...

I have loved you for 13 years. I made 3 children with you maybe that means NOTHING to someone, but it means EVERYTHING to me...

 I am crying tonight because I know it’s just a matter of time. Someday soon, I am going to wake up in the morning and my best friend isn’t going to wake up with me.

And I won’t know what to do...",17Mar2020,1
52,"I know it's not wise to diagnose a family member without confirmation, but I'm pretty much convinced that my Mom has Paranoid Personality Disorder and have been convinced of this for a long time. She will never be diagnosed - she doesn't think anything is wrong with her. We're past trying to get her help. There's no way she would at this point and she's in her 60's, so why even bother trying to anymore? We're tired of her backlash whenever we bring treatment up, of her attacking my Dad like he's trying to work against her with everything. So tired.

Does anyone have a family member who has this personality disorder and how in the world do you cope? 

My anger towards my Mom is so strong right now after an unreasonable argument tonight. It's not fun to talk to her and I like being around her less and less as I get older. It breaks my heart to say this and I don't like the idea of talking about her behind her back and hurting her, but it's true. She's a VERY negative person, she judges people way too easily, she's mean towards others she thinks are against her (which is practically everyone), holds grudges for life against pretty much everyone except her children, distorts reality and truth, and she is so unreasonable. Hearing her talk negatively about people I care about sucks. Seeing her treat others, including my Dad, the way she does when she's like this is too much. She's 2 people. There's a sweet, loving side to her and then there's a hostile, paranoid side. But she's unleashes her hostile, paranoid side more than her sweet, loving side. We never know which side we're going to get and when we bring up certain topics, disagree with her, or she's just in a bad mood, then her hostile side is unleashed and none of us can handle it. 

I'm so tired. Tired of dealing with her. I'm sure everyone else is too. She's shut herself off from relatives (even her own) and only has us. I find myself not dealing with her very well even as the years go by. When she becomes unreasonable, I end up fueling the fire by arguing back, hoping each and every time that she will see my side of things - that she will see reason. I always have that hope. But she never does and I know why - I know it's not her fault. That's she's mentally ill. Hell, I am too. And I know I shouldn't argue back and should drop it, but leaving her thinking she's right and being on her high and mighty horse thinking she's won and having her way just makes me hate her. She's hurt a lot of people in her life and it's sad how my Dad has had to take precautions because of her. Has had to deal with her without her getting help. I'm honestly afraid that at one point she will go too far with things and hurt my Dad physically. After the argument tonight, I had that fear. That's what scares me most.",17Mar2020,1
54,"Mobile and it's late so there is gonna be errors all over this, sorry in advance if you read it and cringe at all the typos.

No throwaway, dont care. No one IRL really knows (cares?) who I am on here anyway.

I'm scared. I am so very fuxking scared. The doctors tell me that despite my previous issues my heart is strong, and that since I'm under 40, I will probably okay if I get corona. But still, I have heart disease. No matter how much I watch what I eat and exercise, I'm still pre diabetic.

I have flatlined before, I was fortunate enough to come back. I know what those few moments did to my wife and children's psyche. I am so afraid. We have a family business. We are going to have to shut it down, at least temporarily until things I'm the world improve. Dont care to shutter to help the greater good. Afraid it will be hard to recover and open back up later. We didnt panic buy and hoard, and we have enough to survive on. Tonight my oldest child and I cleaned and serviced the few guns we own. There are a LOT of whacked out addicts here. Not addicts that need help, addicts that are proud meatheads. They arent preparing to take care of themselves, some are vocal that they are already preparing to ""do what they gotta"". I have not aimed at another human since my time in the Military, could I even be able to do it again? I'm afraid, because most of all, I know that I am starting to succumb to my fears, fears for the health of my self, my family, my community.

I'm getting caught up by my own fear, and its shutting me down.

Thanks for reading, be well everyone, stay healthy and look out for eachother.",17Mar2020,1
55,"the past few weeks I've been really struggling. I'm studying abroad and have just said good bye to my family recently, I did well the first week but after that I either binge eat every night or down a whole bottle of wine to sleep. 

Every day I wake up and feel like absolute shit, especially when lectures start at 8 and I've got like 3 hours of sleep. But i just can't stop, it's like when the night comes I just can't resist the idea of ordering large amount of mcdonalds or going out to buy another bottle of wine. 

Now I don't struggle with being away from home that much, nothing really bothers me at the moment, but I guess I'm drawn into the habit of ruining myself.

The only time when I don't feel this way is when I am a little buzzed. I have been dating this girl and I wonder if it is tied to it. I'm pretty confident in myself but in the past I have went through the same thing with an ex. It was terrible, I would have to force myself to eat peanut butter crackers and chase it with water. At the time it was all I ate for a few months. And the whole time I felt happy in the relationship. In this relationship I'm happy, but what is the matter with me. Is it tied to some subconscious doubt or fear or something that I'm just not realizing. Even today, my girlfriend now made me food for lunch and I had to force myself to eat it. I hadn't eaten at all by that point so I know I was hungry. One thing to note is that I do lose appetite and do get nauseous when I am sad so thats why I have come here.

Today I had to go buy some vegetables at the grocery store, you might as well just have put me through hell. The clerk was a guy around my age and I just felt terrified. My muscles tense, I can't look at him anywhere, I feel an urgency to gtfo. This isn't only there but almost any man close to my age. 

Of course I haven't had the prettiest story with my dad, but this is a new thing for me. It did happen sometimes with someone I felt attracted to, but now it happens anywhere and it's become a real issue.

I have had a terrible year:

- Uncle died on Dec 31st
- Stepdad diagnosed with cancer on January
- Grandma (who I used to live with) has a stroke, loses her memory and now needs a permanent caregiver
- I have to move out of my house back to my mom's, no job prospects.
- I'm moving to Spain in june by myself.

It wasn't me making those decisions because I would have done things differently, I wouldn't have said that or spent that much money or thought those thoughts. This only happened a fews times so no big deal, but all of the sudden recently it has gotten very frequent. An example is yesterday; I remember being there and watching it take place but I don't feel like I was the one at the wheel. It's really weird. Nothing bad has happened and I haven't spent all my money or anything like that, just little things. I don't have anyone I can talk to about it, I don't dare talk to my wife about it for fear that she would use it against me in a fight.

Anyone with BPD out there and normal happy healthy lives? What do you do? Is there any way out? Would you recommend trying to go back on anti depressants or mood stabilizers although it will look horrible on my behalf depending on those as a servicemember?

I’m not going to lie I hate living in this head and the whole work out stay social don’t impulsively spend go to church stuff gets exhausting after a while. I wonder if I’m better off giving up.

I’m not sure how to cope and due to my job as a service mention the military it’s hard to get the help I need without risking discharge as I am already being considered for medical separation.

63,"I’ve been struggling with depression and my general mental health for years now and I only just started trying to do something about it, just started trying to see a doctor, therapist etc. 

Now there’s a global pandemic and obviously life is going to change for the worse. I’ve already been trying to deal with being lonely as it is. I live on my own and honestly, social interaction, going out with friends, family, talking and having fun together, that’s pretty much all I had in life to look forward to. I always told myself that whenever work is going badly or no matter how much I’m trying to deal with, I told myself that everything would be okay as long as I kept my mind on that next trip to the pub with my friends or the next time I’d see my friends for dinner and all that. Now I don’t even have that, now I have nothing. Nothing but myself and the darkness that lives in my mind. I had so many dreams for the future that I’m just seeing get crushed in front of me, I wanted to travel, I wanted to have new experiences, I wanted to one day have a family and now I can’t have any of that. I’ve lost the one thing in this world I had to look forward to, the one thing I had to keep me sane. Now I have nothing, I have nothing to motivate me to carry on or even want to live anymore. I’m struggling to find a reason to even want to get out of bed in the morning. 

I’m sorry I understand this probably sounds like first world complaining considering the crisis we have on our hands but I’m not coping. I can’t live like this, the complete social isolation for this long at a time is honestly more scary to me than any virus or disease. I just called my doctor’s surgery and they’re not even seeing patients right now. 

I don’t know how much more of this I can handle, is there a way I can give myself any kind of motivation to live right now? Is there any way I can even stay sane? Is there any hope that things will be normal one day and that I can finally live my life? Is there any way to convince myself that life is worth living whilst everything is crumbling around me?

I suffer from anorexia. Things were going really bad and it was a dark time but eventually I started eating.

This was just the eating disorder part but the psychological effects it had on me are a different story. I’m suicidal. I’m pretty much always thinking of suicide. I wish i didn’t exist.

Because of my disorder I successfully pushed away all the friends I had and now no one talks to me. I try to talk to them but get really anxious and it doesn’t work out. I have one friend who’s supported me through all this and she’s really great and she’s the only one I talk to but the thing is she has her own life, problems and friends. I cannot bother her with my problems the whole time. I don’t want to talk to my parents. I was depressed before but not this severe. My parents thought as I would start eating, I would get better and they still believe the same. But in reality, it’s completely opposite. My mental healths only worsened. And now when I’m sad, my family behaves as if I’m faking it. Look I feel really bad typing this about them considering they’ve supported me a lot but it’s the way it is. After you try so hard to recover from something you’d think your family would be proud and support you but they’re still of the same mindset that I’m not eating. Things are getting bad and now I get anxious around my own family. I can’t think straight if I’m in a room with any of the members. I get really anxious. I prefer to be alone. I don’t want to talk about this to my parents as they’ll only send me to a therapist and I seriously don’t want to see one because of a past experience and the fact that I’m sure I won’t talk. I don’t know what to do. I wish I could talk about it but I’ve already pushed away all my friends and the one that I still have, she’s already helped me a lot and I don’t want to bother her anymore. I really don’t know what to do. I wish it would all end.",17Mar2020,1

I guess having shitty parents and a narcissist brother didnt help. But idk ive been lying to everybody about my deepest passions and putting on a front and hiding my genuine feelings for so long that I feel like the person I was supposed to be has faded away so much that im just a shell. 

I dont know who I am anymore, I dont like anything or have any strong emotions about anything. I dont get excited about the girls I like or show any interest to them or just friends in general, not just because im afraid but because I have no clue how. Ive tried before and I have no idea what to say or what to do and it doesnt come off the way I want or something.

69,"Hi all,

I wanted to ask a question about resilience. I'm an 18 year old who has just finished high school and decided to take a year off to work and eventually travel. With the recent pandemic, the travel is sort of off the table at the moment, so my year is looking like it will consist of purely working and no study. At the beginning of the year, my mental health took a big drop. I've always suffered with chronic, moderate anxiety, but leaving high school not having a job with the whole year ahead of me really made me worry and become anxious again. This stemmed a lot from feeling aimless and lonely, which I filled with attempts to validate myself which always were unhealthy (e.g. continuously dating people even though I knew I wasn't ready, obsessing over boys and how people looked at me etc.). My genuine connections became less important when compared to self-validation, coupled with drinking which obviously didn't help. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have a job I'm in a better place, yet I have been thinking whether I should start university 6 months earlier (in June) than originally planned since my travel plans have been corrupted by COVID-19. Thankfully, I've learnt a lot about myself in the past 4 or so months in terms of learning to live without study and how to effectively deal with various types of adversity. My question is (finally lol), is this something that would build resilience for me, and more broadly, how important do you think resilience is in becoming the best person you can be in terms of your mental health? Should I go back to study early or continue on a more independent path of working full-time, even if I know it's going to be more difficult?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for such a long story but it's something that I would love to get input on, please let me know any questions or further details if my story is not specific enough or confusing. Love you all ! &lt;3",17Mar2020,1

So, I'm creating a newsletter that I'll send out every week dealing with one specific topic- overwhelming feelings, depression due to the virus, etc. (I'll take topics from folks.)

Here's how the newsletter will look:
- A few lines on what I'll talk about 
- 3 tips for management
- journalling prompts
- Link to a meditation that helps me manage the issue for me (not regular)

he just loves to play his playstation games. he is really awkward, he doesn’t make eye contact and when he walks he has a forward head posture and he never smiles. he is always moody. 

i don’t know.. what can i do? how do i make him more comfortable? and more open? it’s like he’s closed off and only feels happy when he plays games. 

my mum and dad have tried to send him to football club or boxing and he always cries or throws a tantrum. he doesn’t get bullied.. and he has friends at school. he never says anything about school. some days he is happy and cracks jokes. but then he is always with people...

he is quite tall and slim... and i feel like he doesn’t walk properly... he walks weirdly. i do point it out so he becomes more aware but he says he walks fine. idk if this is because he always plays games?

74,"I've been diagnosed by a doctor with depression, anxiety, and OCD- but I feel like I have something else that just isn't explained by these.

I'm incredibly sensitive. if someone is even slightly rude to me, I'm thinking about it all day. if someone is just straight up mean to me or yells at me, i get like devastated by it. I'll cry for hours, even if i dont know the person who said it. I have a lot of self esteem issues because of this. I have almost like PTSD symptoms regarding these really stupid encounters. If someone is cruel to me, i will remember it forever and it will come up when I'm trying to sleep, and i end up not being able to sleep until i'm literally exhausted. 

I always feel like I'm in a fog. I can't think well and there are times where I can't think of the words for what I want to say. Talking is like a chore, and I;m constantly pausing to get my thoughts straight and think of the words I need to use to get my point across. Also I make a lot of stupid mistakes with fact checking and stuff and I feel like I'm a fucking idiot every time.

whenever someone is talking to me, I zone out. I'll start to think about something else, like trauma in my past. People get mad at me because I don't really listen to them. I can get the gist of what they're saying, and if someone is like ""ok then what did I just say?"" i can summarize what they were saying but I never get the important details. Also sometimes, I will ask someone something and they will give me an answer, and then I will ask them the same question a few minutes later because i dont remember what they said. 

It's almost impossible for me to get started doing chores. It will take hours for me to get up the drive to do it, and I'm miserable the whole day because i dread doing it. 

Some doctors have said I might have BPD or bipolar but I just dont feel like I fit those? maybe BPD when I was a young teen, because I got angry very easily when I felt someone was being rude to me, but I don't lash out anymore like I did back then. However, I do still feel extremely low when I get yelled at and it drives to me having ""S-word"" thoughts, and in the past they have made me attempt to actually do it. (don't worry about that happening to me now though, I'm in a place where I'm very happy, and I don't have to interact with the public)

Obviously I'm not looking for a diagnosis from you guys, but if you guys have any ideas of what it could be I'd like to talk to a doctor about it and get their opinion.",17Mar2020,1

It got a lot of really positive responses (and i’ll add it to the bottom in case anyone would like to read it) but i’ve created a sub reddit. For us. For those who have the power to truly feel their way through life. Or maybe need a little bit of guidance.

The subreddit is called LivingWide. This is a term that’s fairly new to me that I love to use. I think it really shows what it means to open up and allow yourself to really feel the full extent of life. And yes, when we do this, when we allow ourselves to feel everything, it can hurt. of course it will hurt. some of it will take a long, long time to fully process and manage. But i have been doing this for about a year now and i can promise you that when you allow yourself to feel everything, little by little, life becomes such a beautiful  and colorful place. 
I want to help people. I don’t want anyone to shut down and not allow themselves to feel anything. I’ve seen it too many times. We are human. We need to feel. 
If you think this could be a helpful community for you, please please check it out. thank you
Here is the original post: 

Whoever’s reading this, please promise me one thing: that you will allow yourself to feel whatever it is that you are feeling to it’s full extent. always. I know it can hurt. i know. but you have to allow yourself to open up and live wide. let others in even if they don’t do the same. feel the light in people’s eyes as you feel the sun on your face. don’t shut down or hide if something is hurting you. it takes a lot of time but eventually you will be able to appreciate the fact that you are feeling, even if it’s a really shitty feeling. 
     I was hospitalized back in march. for a month. and i was out of school for three months. and a lot of “feelings” went through my head. and at first i was overmedicated and couldn’t really feel that much at all. and this was right after having the most intense feelings i’ve ever felt. i remember being there in the hospital and i remember what it felt like. i remember what it felt like before i was in there, too. and after, i didn’t really allow myself to feel that much again. because the pain just wasn’t bearable. but time heals all wounds. i promise. whoever’s out there, whatever you’re going through, continue to feel whatever it is that you’re feeling and let yourself truly and fully heal. we’re going to be okay. we’re all going to be okay",17Mar2020,1

I've been in a bad place lately for a lot of reasons, and one of my major tells when I'm getting really bad is I start to ignore everyone and hole up in my room and do nothing all day.

Anxiety starts to gnaw at me; if no one can see me or interact with me, maybe they'll realize how bad I am and start to hate me. I wallow in my own depression and filth and laziness.

This is a rant more than anything, but if anyone has any input or advice it would be appreciated. 

I have chronic depression and bipolar disorder. I take an antidepressant and mood stabilizer. These meds have worked wonders for my mental health and I have been taking them for the past few months.

But, every time I try to get a refill of my medication through my doctor's office (which is also a formulary), my psychiatrist tries to talk me into going to a different clinic and getting my prescription filled elsewhere. This is because I don't have insurance. He shames me for not having health insurance and I don't understand why. I pay for my medication and appointments out of pocket because it's cheaper than paying for insurance.

I am on day three without my medication and the withdrawals are causing my mental health to deteriorate. It is a fight every month to get my refill and I'm sick of it. My doctor does not advocate for me and I feel like I'm doing something wrong by having to take medication for my mental health.",17Mar2020,1
103,"Please read if you have the time :)

So I’m in my second last year of school and I don’t mind lessons too much, but I’m currently having a difficult time dealing with friends and people I know. Most of the people in my group of friends push each other around, shove people behind doors, grab people etc. but I just want to chill. There’s like a select 3 people (who I consider mostly assholes) that will do this a lot (although it never happens to them because they’re too big) and a few others who join in. 

I just find this shit immature and want to chill. It’s no problem if they want to do it between each other and leave me out of it, but I always end up getting dragged into it. Me and one of my friends usually just sit and try to chill whilst everyone else fucks about like idiots but because we are sitting down, this makes us both easy targets.

This shit just really gets me down and causes me anxiety. I don’t know what to do and I can’t exactly just join a whole new friend group randomly. I already strongly dislike school and this just makes me absolutely hate it. I just want to feel happy and anxiety-free again.",17Mar2020,1

He listens and he’s caring and is just an all around amazing person. But, not knowing when or if I’ll hear from him is just making my chest tighten up and I can’t stop crying when I’m alone.

I’ve never been in a silent treatment before, and I can’t really talk to him first because I don’t think he’ll respond. I’m fine with wanting a break, I just wish he had told me that before disappearing. All of this is just making me feel so alone and anxious.

106,"my sleep hallucinations.
def: hypnagogic hallucinations are imagined sensations that seem very real. They occur as a person is falling asleep, and are also referred to as sleep hallucinations.

often when i am falling asleep i will experience sleep hallucinations, these hallucinations seem very real to me and often include dissociation. my hallucinations have started to happen outside of my this but in this entry i will be discussing my sleep related ones only. i will be reporting these in sections as the types of hallucinations i experience differ greatly. there are only really three true parts to my sleep hallucination side of this tho.

Fake Conversations and Situations.
my first memory of one of these sleep hallucinations happened long before my drug use, i was on facetime to a group of friends and started to drift off slowly. i ended up in this half asleep- half awake dreamy state, having a conversation with somebody who was no longer even in the call- i genuinely believed me and this person were having a conversation and i spoke out loud so everybody in the call heard. i eventually snapped out of this state and completely woke up when i started to realise that this wasn’t actually happening at all, i was very scared by this. i tried to laugh along with my friends as i explained to them what had just happened but on the inside i was absolutely terrified. this started happening irregularly and unpredictably over the course of the next couple of years. i can’t lie when i say that my drug use seems to have increased the amount of times i have these kind of hallucinations. these have stopped becoming just out loud talking and sometimes are/include: visuals, scenarios(such as being in a rocket ship?), auditory hallucinations and texting people with disorganised words that really make no sense? like literal word salad messages that only make sense to me but clearly make no sense by the time i’ve woken up and are conscious again.

EPS (exploding head syndrome)
this one is by far the easiest to explain and actually is a rather common condition. sometimes when i’m falling asleep i will experience loud noises such as banging or bombs exploding in my head along with my body being completely paralysed while i am conscious. this feeling is scary and uncomfortable but has started to bother me less because i know exactly what it is when it happens.

“The phone thing”
the phone thing is similar to my the fake conversations/ scenario part of this because it’s in the same dreamy state. my eyes will be shut and i will genuinely believe that i am typing on my phone in my head. like i will see the phone and see myself and the other person typing although often the texts seem very disorganised and sometimes don’t make much sense. this will sometimes lead me to ignore people’s messages for long periods of time because i believe i am already having a conversation with them.

all of these things happen between once or twice a week at least? sometimes i’ll go a while without having them and sometimes they’ll happen several times a night.

not entirely sure if this belongs here? would honestly just like to hear stories from others as a means of clarification or see if i can get a bit of help? wrote this for myself first but thought maybe it would be a good idea to post about it?",17Mar2020,1
107,"Hi! Any parents here who lost their child because of suicide? Specifically those who lost their only child.

I'm an only child and planning to end my life soon. As you all know, the only reason most suicidal persons hold on to life is because we don't want our parents to be sad.

I know you were devastated,but I wanna know how you guys dealt with. 

How long did you grieve? 
How painful was it? 
Was it bearable? 
How long did it take before you accepted what happened?

112,"I have ADHD and my boyfriend has depression, possibly caused by ADHD too but he refuses to get tested for it. We have a great relationship overall. He’s kind and supportive of me and I can tell he genuinely wants to get better but doesn’t know how. 

His depression used to be really bad but we got through it together and it’s been a bit better. Which is great! I’m so so proud of him! However, because of his depression hitting him in his teens and the way his family was ran he never really learned the be an adult. He knows how to save and stuff but getting help around the house is like pulling teeth. Getting him to do or try anything he doesn’t want to do is difficult. Which I understand because my adhd makes it hard for me to but I went to therapy and got meds. He refuses to try either and putting a strain on our relationship. 

I want him to be happy and confident that he can preform basic tasks but I’m not sure how to do that without forcing him to do things like laundry or cook very basic meals. I try to help walk him through it but he’ll just stop in the middle and make me finish. If I wasn’t the only one working this wouldn’t be an issue but I am. I work most days and he’ll volunteer to do things around the house but when the time comes he falls through. For example I asked him to do the laundry last week and he never did so now I’m putting it way while washing another load because now we have more laundry.

120,"Hi Everyone,

This is a difficult time for many people, whether they have mental health issues or not.  I've noticed several people posting and asking about how to deal with the isolation/lack of being able to socialize during this time.  If you are also dealing with depression, keeping yourself isolated can be even harder, no matter where you are in your recovery process.  So here are a few ideas to help you through the tough times, and hopefully help you deal with isolation.

Something to consider is limiting your exposure of listening to info about the virus to a few minutes a day, so that you can keep up with the newest information, but not overwhelm yourself. If you are isolated with family/friends/roommates and they are constantly watching/reading/listening about it, and it starts to overwhelm you, walk out of the room or ask them to please not discuss it in front of you. Do what you can to stay informed, but not over loaded. 

Keep (or start) a routine of some kind, even if it has to be amended due to closures and cancellations. Get up at the same time, eat at the same time, schedule activities for yourself, go to bed at the same time, etc. Schedules can help reduce stress, help us keep our focus, spread our activities over each day, so that we aren't over loaded one day, and under scheduled another day, and helps us stay organized.

Do your best to stay in contact with people, even if it has to be over the phone, or text, or face time. Do more posting on different subs on Reddit and see if there are some people you can connect to, you might make a new friend or two through that.  As I mentioned, I have been seeing others post about this concern about the isolation related to the virus, so have a scroll through the other posts, and comment to some one else who is in the same boat, saying 'hi', chat and see if you have something in common, or like the same sport, or music, or books, or some small connection, and then keep in touch and/or 'chat' with the others on this sub. Maybe people can all make some new online friends that need some socialization to feel a bit better during this tough time.  I get it is different than real life, but it's at least a little way you could try and get some socialization.

If you are a sports fan and your sport has been cancelled, (Example: for me, the NHL was a huge distraction. I'm still getting a little bit of hockey, as they have been airing some 'classic' games). Maybe you could check out your area for any re-runs of games, or even go to YouTube and watch old videos of games, bloopers, best plays, etc.

Open your curtains so you can at least see outside, and let some sun in/natural lighting; it can also give an illusion the room/space is bigger than it really is, hopefully lessening the sense of feeling boxed in.

Here is a list of ideas of things to do to try and keep busy that I am copying here, as well as some relaxation techniques to consider trying----

\-

jig saw puzzles (you can find some online if you can't go buy some)

crossword puzzle books (you can find some online if you can't go buy some)

word search books (you can find some online if you can't go buy some)

paint by numbers sets (not sure if you can do this online or not)

playing cards

drawing pictures

colouring books and crayons/colouring pencils (sounds juvenile, but colouring can be very relaxing and a good distraction technique)

write a poem/story/journal

board games

books (read an old favourite, or find something you normally wouldn't read, to see if you can find something new to enjoy)

craft type kits (maybe start a new hobby that isn't too expensive)

do some chores around the house, maybe it's a good time to finish any projects you haven't had time to complete.

exercise (dancing, stretching, skipping, anything that moves your body)

listen to music/songs/sounds you like eg: water sounds/thunder &amp; lightening storms/whale sounds/etc

talk/phone/text a friend/face time/post online

relaxation techniques (Ex: progressive relaxation); deep breathing

sing songs

yoga

light scented candles/incense (relaxing)

take a nap

re-watch a favourite tv show/movie; or watch a new show that is out of your normal genres to watch, you may find something new you like

watch You Tube videos (Ex; Jelle's marble racing, it is quite fun and mesmorizing)

video games; computer games

make your favourite hot drink, or food you like

write a letter to someone

smell some flowers

take a bath/shower with your favourite soaps/bubble bath

read other stories on Reddit (check out some other subs you don't usually read)

if you are in an apartment with a balcony, (away from others), spend a bit of time on the balcony getting some fresh air, read a book, or magazine, or just sit and watch the clouds or do some deep breathing

\*\*\*\*\*---go for a walk outside only ***IF*** your area is allowing that; practise social distancing and go to a more isolated area if possible; if it is not allowed where you live, follow the appropriate rules.

\-

\- There is also another Reddit sub that has a lot of good information, maybe check it out for further suggestions. It's called [r/SelfCareCharts](https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfCareCharts/)

Here are some types of Relaxation techniques you could try-----

**Relaxation techniques----** (I prefer # 2 &amp; 3; it does take practise, one or two times won't do much)----

1. **Breath focus**. In this simple, powerful technique, you take long, slow, deep breaths (also known as abdominal or belly breathing). As you breathe, you gently disengage your mind from distracting thoughts and sensations. Breath focus can be especially helpful for people with eating disorders to help them focus on their bodies in a more positive way. However, this technique may not be appropriate for those with health problems that make breathing difficult, such as respiratory ailments or heart failure.
2. **Body scan**. This technique blends breath focus with **progressive muscle relaxation**. After a few minutes of deep breathing, you focus on one part of the body or group of muscles at a time and mentally releasing any physical tension you feel there. A body scan can help boost your awareness of the mind-body connection. If you have had a recent surgery that affects your body image or other difficulties with body image, this technique may be less helpful for you. [https://www.verywellmind.com/how-do-i-practice-progressive-muscle-relaxation-3024400](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-do-i-practice-progressive-muscle-relaxation-3024400)
3. **Guided imagery**. For this technique, you conjure up soothing scenes, places, or experiences in your mind to help you relax and focus. You can find free apps and online recordings of calming scenes—just make sure to choose imagery you find soothing and that has personal significance. Guided imagery may help you reinforce a positive vision of yourself, but it can be difficult for those who have intrusive thoughts or find it hard to conjure up mental images.
4. **Mindfulness meditation**. This practice involves sitting comfortably, focusing on your breathing, and bringing your mind's attention to the present moment without drifting into concerns about the past or the future. This form of meditation has enjoyed increasing popularity in recent years. Research suggests it may be helpful for people with anxiety, depression, and pain.

124,"trigger warning for assault and rape.

It's already been... I think 3 years by now? Or almost? I have PTSD so my timeline is fuzzy and I'm working to reorganize my brain. But point is it feels like it's been too long to report what happened, my bf tells me it's not but idk how the police would see it.

Ex bf did stuff like gripping my arms too hard when I'm trying to get away and leaving bruises, throwing me across the room, throwing stuff at me (left a huge welt on the back of my head once), general intimidation,  touching me inappropriately in public when I tried shrugging him off of me, and then eventually it just escalated into him well I guess raping me but there was one specific incident where I fully 100% believe turned into rape while the other incidents I feel like I didn't speak up enough. This incident involved him hurting my back and me screaming to get him to stop, I said ""stop"", and he said some straight bullshit - ""no one is going to hear you scream"". And he was fucking right, because we had screaming fights often where ik the neighbors heard and beard me crying but yeah no one did anything about it not even me. So anyway I have nerve damage on a few inch spot on my back from that specific incident. 

My stomach is getting all twisty thinking about that. It is the main reason I wanted to report him to the police and report that this was something someone did to me. Otherwise I'm paying the medical bills for it, if it can even be treated which my doc said I'd have to see a specialist if I wanted it to be looked at further, and that's extremely unfair. He also cheated on me, I believe gave me chlamydia but that's also something I'm unsure about. Overall he was not a good person, not to me at least, and very manipulative and untrustworthy. Idk if any of this is enough to report him and idk what would come of reporting him or if it's even worth it. And I would like him to have a record so future people interacting him can possibly find out what he's capable of. I feel like he's a monster walking around freely. I don't really have proof and I don't expect him to go to jail or whatever but I just want justice I guess??? As much justice as one could get in this type of situation?",17Mar2020,1

Reposting some of this, hopefully this will resonate and help someone else, please, if you have no one else to talk to PM me, Wait, just wait, just until someone replies to you.

I'm a multiple suicide attempt survivor. Don't ignore the signs. I wouldn't have tried to gas myself in my car x 4 if someone had read the signs, (I'm going to my car and gassing myself, can you feed my dogs?), real subtle! If someone had reached out I would not have tried to kill myself, all those times.

I have depression, I have tried to commit suicide at least 5 times, usually triggered by emotional events in my life. I am lucky to live in a country with socialised healthcare and I am within walking distance of a hospital.

My last 2 attempts I stopped and walked to the hospital and got counseling which stopped me. I was just lonely, sad and down, triggered by some relationship stuff at the wrong time.

Please, please, this is an illness. You should not feel ashamed about your mental illness, there should be no more stigma about it than asthma or diabetes. It is an illness and needs to be treated.

127,"My therapist and I went deeper into the idea of ""the Bully"" today. The basics are that sometimes you have a thought, but it isn't really what YOU think. It may be something you learned from societal pressures or something like that. So when you have that thought of ""I'm useless, I can't do anything right"", blame the bully. My Bully is a couple named Karen and Brad. But today we talked about a new sort of bully. The one for depression, who tells you thinks like ""It doesn't matter anyway, so why bother?"" You know, when you NEED to do laundry, but you just can't be bothered to care. I named her Shelby, and you know what my therapist said? He said ""Don't just ignore Shelby. Hear her out. Let her say her piece, and then decide if you actually trust her. Because sometimes Shelby makes a good point, but only sometimes. There are times when you actually do need to stop trying to clean or be productive and take a nap. It's good for you. But Shelby wants you to do that all the time and you know that's not helpful.

128," 

Everytime certain people touch me or my things I get this weird ""feeling"", like their mark is on me somehow and I can't get it off. People say Im a germophobe but I dont think about the bacteria themselves or getting sick, I just think about the essence or feeling of that person getting on me. So I always ask my mom not to step on my guitar wire or my ""still-good"" clothes when coming into my room, but she just does it anyway, and I just inexplicably cringe and get this painful rage, which I dont externalize, I just get irritated or exhausted and sigh at her ""please dont step on my things"", to which she usually just denies it or says ""sorry"" indignantly. Another example, earlier she knocked on my door and opened it and barged in, which cancels out the politeness of knocking so why even bother knocking. Anyway, I was in here recovering from an awkward day at school and she just startles me, and touches my doorknob (the latter of which being what made me really uncomfortable).One time my dad patted me on the shoulder and I just instinctively put my left hand in my sleeve and rubbed his touch off the shoulder when i thought he wasnt looking, but he saw and I got chewed out for being touchy and hurting peoples feelings all the time. everyone's been telling me I have to stop being so touchy. Ive never really tried explaining it to them, apart from asking them not to touch me, bc i feel like im just making it up, but they keep getting mad at me and saying Im too touchy and i dont know how to stop having this feeling. Also, if the person doing it is a friend, or a stranger that has evident hygiene, I dont get uncomfortable. Its only with family members (except for one of my brothers and my sister who i never fight with, so maybe that has something to do with it) and people i dont find appealing.

129,"I recently got out of a mental hospital in February, after a seven day stay (it was a 5150 that turned into a 5250, that's a 14 day hold but didn't have to stay the full 14 days), and I only got out by lying through my teeth that I wasn't suicidal anymore (I still suffer from suicidal thoughts).

135,"Hello
I’m a 23 year old female whose struggled with SH for a while now. My biggest triggers are anxiety surrounding being in and having control, and self hate towards myself. I guess that all somewhat ties together. 
I’m hoping fellow Redditors can give me some advice on avoiding self harm with everything going on now. I still have a job (as of today) but all I can think about is losing my income, not being able to eat, getting kicked out of my home. Then it starts turning to darker worries; what if i can’t fill my prescription, what if my diabetic dad catches covid and dies, what if society crashes all together....

Maybe valid worries, but not doing me much help stewing on it. I woke up for the first time in a few months with the urge to self harm again to gain back some control. I know other people are probably feeling the same way as me. If anyone has anyone words of advice, tips, or tricks that work for them it would be greatly appreciated.

140,"Hi my name is Loui. If you're reading this the chances are you sorted by new and I just wanted to tell what has been the worst days of my life for me. I just hope that someone will see this and may just relate and feel not alone. 

Let's start from the beginning. I met a girl through an app called Yubo. We talked for a month before deciding to meet in person in December 2019. That day was I can say was one of the happiest days of my life and I asked her to be my girlfriend, she said yes. Over the last couple months we fell in love and met up quite. a few times. My parents didn't like her, well my dad wanted me to get rid of her and never speak again, while my step mum was dubious about the situation. Over a few weeks, my parents brainwashed me into dumping her. At first I was ok, with this and she was heart broken. It was only last Friday when she decided to hang out with a guy I was told not to worry about. They went and did the exact same thing we did on one of our dates. Same place, same meal after. This then sent me down a road of self destruction. I started having panic attacks, crying my eyes out and self harm. this was 2 weeks after we had broken up. Then Saturday night I laid in bed at night considering ending it all. I didn't because I had hope she would take me back. I then spoke to her and on Monday I asked is she had caught feelings for this new guy. She responded yes. I was broken. I didn't know what to do. I still don't. Last night again I laid in bed crying my eyes out and proceeded to punch myself in the face, calling myself worthless, useless and that I shouldn't be alive. I managed to get through today but I don't know about the rest of tonight or even tomorrow. I have no one left anymore and it makes me wonder where do I go from here. 

Any response will be appreciated.

Thank you",17Mar2020,1
141,"This past week has been really stressful for me, but I’ve made a couple steps in the right direction for my well-being and for that I’m really proud of myself. :)

My body image hasn’t been good since I was about 12 so that’s around 4 years. However, I slowly stopped having proper lunches all together over this past year since I don’t really have much of an appetite around lunch time anyway, but even when I do think about maybe buying some lunch my body image goes completely out of whack and I end up feeling way too guilty and shit about myself to have a meal - so then I’ll just either buy a small snack or wait until dinner. However, on Thursday, there was a themed day in the school cafeteria, and the food looked REALLY good and I was in a decently good mood, so for once I finally thought “you know what? fuck it” and bought the lunch. It was curly fries, onion rings, a hot dog and a caramel popcorn brownie with ice cream. So - compared to usually not eating a meal, that was a pretty huge deal for me. I haven’t eaten a proper lunch since then, but still.

Also, on Sunday I went for a walk, and for the first time in MONTHS, almost a whole YEAR, I went out in public without makeup. There weren’t nearly as many people outside as usual due to coronavirus so it’s not like many people would see me anyway but that’s still a MASSIVE deal for me, I’m usually WAY WAY WAY too anxious and terrified to go out in the open with no makeup on. I’m not saying makeup is a bad thing, but I feel like more often than not, I’m wearing it for the wrong reasons, doing it to hide my insecurities because I secretly hate myself rather than doing it because I like to do it or because it makes me feel good.

So yeah, though they were small, things happened this week that I wouldn’t imagine happening for a long time. So yeah, I’m proud. And no one can take that away from me. :)",17Mar2020,2

148,"This is a very long ramble/rant and I apologize, but it just all needs to get out of my head and go *somewhere*, and maybe I could find some answers or advice by putting it out there, because quite frankly this is ridiculous and I'm tired of it. Rest assured I have no desire to die, but this is a daily thing and I want it to stop, and don't know how to convince myself. Everything is a debate or an argument for me, including when my opponent is myself, and I don't have sufficient counterpoints to win. I won't blame you for skimming, and I've provided a **TL;DR** near the end.

I think it started when I met one of my friends. He used to be abusive (he isn't anymore and feels endlessly remorseful about who he used to be and has improved, he isn't a concern currently, so for now I'll be talking about what he did in his old state that is now gone.) Before that point, I remember being very open, expressive, and loved what I made. Which, for reference, is art, writing, and characters.

To all of my friends, I was still emotionally open and would make comments about how much I loved/valued them, would comfort and support them, etc. I really looked up to my abusive friend specifically, because he seemed very 'cool.' Collected, alluringly distant, and an amazing sense of humor. So I ended up becoming very attached to him.

However, he was remarkably judgmental of my interests and would frequently shame them and me, for example putting down my preference of drawing animals instead of humans, putting down my non-human characters as inferior to his, dismissing the games I liked, etc. But still I think I was fairly happy and open, just not so much with my interests, which was fine at the time; his personality otherwise was enough to outweigh that caveat.

Well, one day he suddenly logged off of our primary platform. Me, bubbly and unaware and wanting to hang out with my best of friends, as well as figuring it was a joke of sorts since our friend group would sometimes tease each other by blocking or leaving and then coming back

 I messaged him on another platform, playfully teasing him while expressing my fondness for his company. His reply was seething, declaring me annoying and instructing me to not bother him anymore. Not just for that message, but in general.

I know and acknowledge that this is a fairly minor thing that *really* shouldn't have had much of an impact, but regardless of how unreasonable or disproportionate my reaction was, it happened. 

Being directly told that I was unbearably annoying by someone I looked up to as much as I did, in a moment where I was completely vulnerable and expressing nothing but my affection and appreciation for them, wounded me and made me completely shut down and change as a person. I would hide everything about myself, from my feelings to my interests, to make everything all about him. Whatever he was interested in would dictate the current topic, and my interests (that I was open about) could only be related to his, because I could be confident that they didn't bore or annoy him. I stopped showing him my art and characters out of internal shame, and would change or deflect the subject ifever he brought them up. I would never initiate conversation with him and would instead wait for him to come to me, out of fear of annoying him and losing his friendship. It all became a mask of sorts that I had to don around him and the other people in that friend group.

What further exacerbated this problem, is before him I had another childhood friend who I often talked to and had known for several years. She had her issues as well as I, but we were open with each other. Around the time I met the abusive friend, she had to cut contact for months due to an array of troubles at home. So with the loss of the one friend I could be myself around, I had to wear the mask almost all of the time; there *were* no other friends to get a break with, or talk to.

Over time I got more comfortable in the mask than outside of it; being secretive, aloof, and mocking the concept of expressing affection was becoming second nature. So much so that when my childhood friend *did* finally get to contact me again, I had changed too much, and we couldn't relate anymore. Where we used to be happy, bubbly, and open with each other, I now had the ingrained instinct to be distant and dismissive. We've never had a significant conversation since before she left.

Years of upholding this attitude passed. I'd say it became first nature. I found that being distant protected not only my interests and feelings, but everything. As long as I was numb and unfeeling, as long as I never acknowledged emotion, I would never be hurt. I learned to divert any thoughts of sadness or other negativity to the point where they never appeared to begin with.

To my friends and to myself, I had become the cool, collected, amusing, and alluringly distant friend who never lost control, had a great sense of humor, and never bothered anyone. And thus was the reputation I had to maintain, I decided. To admit anything else would be taken as weakness.

But a lot of time has passed, and I've come to notice some things and changes. Where this was originally a mask that I could take off and relax from, it seems to have become stuck, so to say. Even anonymously, even among people who have no idea who I am or was, the defenses I've built for someone who's no longer a concern remained.

I have new friends, now. The formerly abusive one is the only one who stayed with me out of that old friend group, and he's changed. Even he has discarded his cool facade in favor of opening up to me about all of his troubles, spending long nights talking and crying to me about everything, being completely vulnerable. But even seeing this display of full and complete trust in me to not judge him or strike when he was weak was not enough for me to lower my own defenses. I simply can not fathom the idea of trusting someone else to offer this same service to me that I did to him, and I can not bring myself to be openly supportive or emotional, even when it's absolutely needed.

One night, I thought he had taken his own life. I cried to myself in secrecy, *but even that was not enough for me to say something supportive or show emotion to him*, which I did berate myself plenty for. The eternal suspicion and defensiveness affects everything that I say and think. I'm always worried that I'm being played for a fool, lured into a false sense of security or safety just to be suddenly wounded. And in a way, my mind felt justified in it's caution, because he *didn't* kill himself, as he revealed a few days later. *If I would have dropped the defenses and shown vulnerability then, I would have been made a fool of*, my mind decided, despite how absolutely stupid and selfish that is.

My new friends are a stark contrast to myself and the old friend. They're open about their troubles and their support and their emotions and their interests. They show off their creations confidently, and what they make is so amazing and inspirational to me. They're fun and caring, and don't judge me beyond a little playful teasing, which we all do to each other in good fun. But even then, knowing this, even knowing that they admire and appreciate what I do show, even knowing they care about me as a person, I still can not be wholly open, either with my feelings or with my interests.

I would never say what I just said about them to them directly. To do so would be making myself vulnerable, and I can't bear the thought of being wounded again.

I have to nearly force myself to show off anything I'm invested in, whether it's media or what I've made. And when I do show it, I still have to act dismissive and distant from it, out of fear of them thinking what I love (and by extension, me) is stupid, worthless, or otherwise not up to their standards. Furthermore, I still can't offer my friends emotional support.

Albeit weathered, the defenses and worries remain, and over time have even festered into all new creatures.

Recently, three of my friends met up together. As other than this all of our connections are online, this knocked out three people I often spoke to as they were naturally more occupied with enjoying each other's company for the duration of their visit, leaving me with an unusual amount of alone time to think. From this experience I've discovered a few things.

* I rely very heavily on my friends, which conflicts with the aloof attitude that suggests otherwise.
* This is because I evidently require at least daily social interaction with someone in order to distract myself from my own mind. I think this is due to a formed habit/reliance from usually talking to someone for lengthy periods every day (between having a sizable friend group and most of them, and myself, enjoying very long VCs.)
* When given too much time to think and nothing to think about, I will turn on myself. Unless expressed or released in some way, these thoughts will persist undeterred and distract me from all other tasks.

As I mentioned, I used to be very good at diverting negative thoughts. It became so normal that it was no longer a conscious effort. I think either the 'dam' has broken, or I've simply fallen out of practice, because I can not seem to shelf the negative, paranoid thoughts that are now plaguing me. In fact, they seem to be becoming more aggressive, coming right back the moment I'm alone and not occupied by a task that requires **all** of my focus.

Now not only am I assaulted by fears about what could happen ifever I was vulnerable around anyone, regardless of how unfounded, but by fears of being left behind. Because of all of my issues, my mind's newest worry is that I'm perceived as an extremely dispensable person.

I don't show any of what I'm invested in, I don't initiate conversations, and I don't make super personal connections, and I'm just not very interesting all-around compared to some of my friends. The biggest thing I provide is humor, jokes, entertainment, and distractions.

My mind is trying to convince me that now that my friends are starting to meet with each other and are extremely happy with each other, I will ultimately be deemed boring and repetitive, and left behind by all of them. Being left alone means alone with my mind, which is a thought that sickens me, as it would mean a constant battering of paranoid thoughts without distraction unless I can re-train myself to divert them.

These two worries conflict; the fear of being left behind and dismissed, and the fear of forming attachments and being hurt again, and the constant internal argument between them is wearing me down. I know that being hurt is a part of life, but I'm terrified of it. I desperately long to lower the defenses, stop worrying, enjoy what I love openly and happily, and trust my friends; it's all the most appealing thing I could think of.

But the fear of someone I admire, including my friends, dismissing it as worthless, or hurting me when I open up to them again, shatters me instantly. I've posted a piece my writing before- a very, very personal, emotional piece that I was even proud of- and had an idol of mine just *jokingly tease* that it gave them secondhand embarrassment, and even that *still* destroyed me all over again.

I'm extremely frail but have the reputation and front of being tough, and I don't know what to do. I just want to be able to relax, trust, and truly enjoy what I make, but I'm always stopped by my own paranoia. I've started entering a loop of deciding what I make is never good enough for me to show off, and I just keep scrapping and remaking it. I can't even *force* myself to begin to extend beyond or open up my defenses; I've tried when I'm anonymous and have no risk to my existing connections or persona, and even then, I just can't, no matter how much I want to. I don't know how to do anything without feeling unbearably awkward, embarrassed, or uncomfortable.

**Tl;DR**: Way too overly worried about being ridiculed, which prevents me from being confident and comfortable in what I make, as well as paranoid about being hurt for being vulnerable, despite both of these fears being unnecessary in my current surroundings. No idea how to get over them and move on. Frustrated, tired, sad. Any input is welcome.

Some notes:

* Seeking any professional help is out of the question. Other my own obvious unwillingness to be vulnerable, I'm trapped with very unsupportive parents who are entirely in control of my situation for reasons I don't want to get into. Any solutions or advice should ideally be things I can do on my own.
* ""Just do it, it'll be fine"" is an appealing thought, and one that I've tried. The fear physically overwhelms me, and I stop and retract into the tried-and-true safety net. I know that I shouldn't, but knowing it and doing it are two separate things, apparently. This also goes for things like ""just break through and talk to your friends.""
* ""Just do what you like and don't worry about what others say"" is also an appealing thought. That's what was going through my head when I put my heart and soul into that written piece and had it be insulted by someone I idolized. This is all-around a difficult thing for me to do, it seems, as this is the approach I've tried and failed several times. I see what my friends make and can't help but find it so much more interesting and better-made than my own crafts, thus the shame and paranoia comes back, and I go back into the safety net.
* ""Your new friends will definitely not act like the old one."" I know. I believe it. But again, the fear never completely leaves, and if I try to put all of my trust in them, it will overwhelm me and pull me back again.
* ""Talk to the one who originally hurt you."" It was *so* long ago, and he already feels bad about who he used to be and what he's done, I don't want to make him feel even more guilty by opening up about how he seems to have caused all of this to his longest, closest friend. He's diagnosed with mental illnesses and suicidal tendencies, so I don't think this is a productive venture.
* ""This is all incredibly minor and it's dumb that you're worked up over it."" I know, and I've tried to tell myself that, too. Mind can't seem to trump matter here, which is part of where my annoyance and frustration comes from, since I can usually logic my way out of issues like this.

Even now as I force myself to post this, I find I'm bracing for someone to say I'm stupid, haha. I may indeed be stupid, but I'm in this situation regardless and also getting desperate. This is the only way I can think of to get some external input to perhaps sway the argument and ground my mind.",17Mar2020,2

I’ve taken this medication off and on for the past few years.

Sometimes I experience feelings as I have described above.

Does anyone feel this way as well. I think I might be just imagining things. I personally hate the idea of taking antipsychotics because of how they affect the brain chemistry.

158,"Ok, so I suffer from a few anxiety disorders but when I am at home I am usually anxiety free. However I often feel very defocused and numb. I feel like I can't focus on anything or feel things around me emotionally. I can't feel happiness or sadness, especially in stressful situations. But when I get drunk I suddenly start getting agitated, emotional and start crying about everything. This has been happening to me for a few years. I feel very emotionally numb and when I get drunk I suddenly start crying about everything and I can't stop talking about things that have been bothering me during the day, even small trivial things. I also have noticed that I have trouble noticing and reacting when someone is bothering me in my everyday life. I mean, I notice it somehow subconsciously but don't understand that I feel anger. And when I get drunk I suddenly become very angry, crying and talking about the person that made me feel that way. It's like I can see every emotion 100 times more clearly when I get drunk. But because alcohol affects your ability to be rational I always end up an emotional mess. How do I become more emotionally aware and stable? Do you have any tips?

I have been fighting with my mental health problems about my insecurities all my life and I hate that it affects my personal life, specially the man I truly love with all my heart: my boyfriend.

He really likes joking around and he´s really funny but... The jokes about me being ""too clingy"",  ""too annoying"" or ""too stupid"" makes me sad... I really overthink EVERYTHING and I know I have a problem but I want to recover and be like everyone else... I feel like my boyfriend is very careful when joking around me now and I feel terrible..... because we have talked about this but this is something I have to solve by myself.

160,"I initially emailed the UK charity Mind about this, but got a really textbook, vague response. So I decided to take to the internet! Here's the original email I sent to the charity. If you have a minute, please have a read and let me what you think is up, how I could help etc.   


*""I’m emailing because recently I met up with an old acquaintance from uni, her name’s \[let's call her Sami\], and immediately when we started hanging out in person, I noticed she was very much not herself. She was talking to herself, consistently mumbling, laughing… her personal hygiene wasn’t great, and she wasn’t able to actually hold a conversation. When I asked her a question, she’d trail out mid sentence and go back to mumbling, and the things she had to contribute to conversation made me feel like she wasn’t that well-connected to reality.*

*Her mother came to drop her off to our hangout which was a bit of a red flag, and she explained to me that Sami wasn’t very well, but it wasn’t until her mother left, and Sami and I started trying to talk that I really saw how badly unwell she was. When the time came for our hangout to end (we were at a restaurant), she went to go back to her mother, but I didn’t actually feel comfortable leaving her to walk the streets alone even though she had a destination that was round the corner (her mum was just shopping nearby).*

*Sami’s not that close-a friend of mine, I’ve only known her a few years, and can count the number of times we’ve spoken on one hand. She’s usually very intelligent, thoughtful, sharp, and jokey. Completely different to who she is now. What’s more, she’d never said anything in the past about having any kind of underlying disorder or condition, so this was a complete shock.*

*I’m now wondering what can be done to help her? Can you offer any advice? I’m happy to provide more details, to the best of my ability, as I said I don’t know her that well.""*",17Mar2020,1

163,"Anxiety is a normal part of the human experience. It evolved as a tool we could use to detect threats in our environment and adjust our thoughts and behaviors accordingly to ensure our safety. When functioning properly it can be an effective warning system. Healthy anxiety is merely a form of information that we can analyze and act on if we see fit.

Chronic, excessive anxiety is something else entirely. It floods our body with unnaturally high levels of cortisol and adrenaline for extended periods of time. It can wear down our immune systems and overwhelm us psychologically. Uncontrolled and superabundant anxiety can be like a giant maniacal spider, snatching our every thought and spinning each into its darkest iteration.

We may be in a state of constant worry, obsessing over past mistakes and fretting about what lies in store for us in the future. It may become difficult to leave the house, speak to other people or trust our own decision making. Our worst fears, however outlandish, may seem always on the verge of coming to fruition.

I’ve lived with chronic anxiety my entire life. It ebbs and flows, but it’s always there, a shadow I can’t ever seem to shake. Sometimes it would be so bad it would feel like my brain was on fire. I was afraid of everything, all the time. Getting through the day was a feat of extreme mental and emotional endurance. From the moment I woke up all I could think about was slipping back into bed and receiving the temporary reprieve of sleep.

These days my anxiety is consistent, but stable. I’m never comfortable. I can’t sit still for more than a few moments without shifting positions. Leaving the house requires some serious psychological prep-time. My brain isn’t on fire, but it itches. And yet I’m rarely in serious distress. I don’t have the flu. It’s a low-grade fever.

There are even rare moments I feel no anxiety whatsoever. These are the moments when I panic. If I’m not feeling anxious then something is really wrong. It’s only logical that when anxiety is your baseline, no anxiety is an indicator that something has changed, and maybe not for the better. So when these moments come I hold my breath and wait for the other shoe to drop. Feeling okay? That’s not okay.

I’ve actually grown fond of my anxiety. I rely on it. It gives me energy. It gives me focus. Unless my depression has totally taken me over, I’m ready and raring to go. Fight-or-flight. Do-or-die. The intensity of this psychological state is addictive. Every day life can be dull. Anxiety gives it teeth. There have been times when I would purposely get myself wound up before going in for a shift at work. I needed my juice to get through the day.

Who would I be without my anxiety? Calm, chill, relaxed? Someone who can take the time to think things through rationally and who doesn’t overreact or respond impulsively? Someone who could take the energy spent on excessive worry and put it towards things that are more healthy, productive and positive? That doesn’t sound so bad, actually. But I would really miss the rush. Anxiety makes me feel like a soldier in a war zone. And I like it.

What can I say, I’m addicted to my anxiety. I’m addicted to the hormone high. I think I’ve lived with it too long. Out of a desperate need to cope, I developed a toxic, dysfunctional way of relating to my illness. It’s holding on to me, and I’m holding on just as tightly to it.

This needs to end. It won’t be easy. This is an addiction and a mental illness rolled into one. But it’s possible. The first step would be to say:

*Sorry, anxiety, I’m just not that into you anymore*",17Mar2020,1

Now with the self quarantine it gets even worse because I don’t have a rhythm in my day schedule anymore. I have got this for a few months now and I think they’re panic attacks. It happens when I think about a subject that gives me anxiety a lot especially when I’m alone. I don’t really know what to do, but I really want it to go away.

166,"I made a similar post a while ago and the commenters helped me in deciding that I was probably having a rough time with my Bipolar. I've started taking my meds again and some things have vastly improved whilst others haven't.

Right now I often get so angry at everything. Someone says the wrong thing - I'm pissed off, something takes too long - I'm pissed off, I think the wrong thing - I'm pissed off or if I get something wrong - I'm pissed off. And not just mildly annoyed; I've been containing it mostly but when I can't I'll throw into a fit of rage. I'll throw, flip and destroy everything I cam while I feel angry. In the past I've attacked people when I've been so angry and put people in hospital only to later get angry soon after because I feel so stupid about it. Right now I don't know how the world works and it's unfair, though I'm too scared to tell anyone unless they say it is fair and I'm just a little bitch or something. I've considered killing myself a lot over these past couple of weeks. Though I can't do that as I don't believe I actually want that. Though I do often want to seriously injure other people and think about it whenever I'm angry, which is very often. When I'm calm I'm fine and feel guilty as hell for some of the things I think or do but I feel liable to do something dangerous soon. I can't talk to anyone as I know they'd either not listen or they'd charge me with every crime they can, lock me away and throw away the key, testament to the world's unfairness. I hate to say it but I loosely plan acts of terrorism in my head while I'm in this angry state. I can't win, I'm pissed off, I break nearly everything I own and I want to kill myself when I'm not breaking something.

I want to cry, I wish I could cry. I can't and I don't know why God can't give me that courtesy. 8 years, I hate my mother, I hate her boyfriend, I hate the people I live with, I hate my life and I could say I'm going to do something but I'll probably just swallow this shit whole, have it go unspoken of and carry round this shit like a stone in my shoe hoping to God each day I'm alive isn't one I kill someone.",17Mar2020,1

169,"Hi everyone. Just wanted to come on here and share what I've been going through lately. The past couple of months have been excruciating. I guess the downward spiral began when my boyfriend left me. He manipulated me and put me through a lot of mental agony. He cut off communication all of a sudden and didn't tell me why he ended things. He would text me a little bit, call me, but would always make excuses about why he couldn't see me. Eventually, I told him that sending time together is important for me, to which he replied in a gibberish text days later. 2 months later, with barely any communication, he texted me at 1:30 AM saying that he saw no future with me which is why he treated me like this. I definitely got the hint before, but I guess I was hoping that he'd come back. 

After he left, I felt like something was wrong with me. For the past two months, I was confused and mainly blamed myself. I couldn't function or do anything; I even didn't eat some days. I think that I was depressed. I went into a research frenzy, trying to make excuses for him and went deep into psychology, like reading about attachment theories, anxiety, etc. I guess I was just trying to cope. I tried so hard to let him and the memories go, and I still do, but images keep flashing in my mind from our time together and I can't stop them. Even though I know that he is toxic, I want him back, and the fact that I want him back makes me more depressed because I then blame myself. I tell myself that I am not self-sufficient or strong enough to be content with who I am. 

Now, I want to get back to who I was before I met him. I was very motivated, focused, and genuinely happy, even though I was alone. I am trying to finish my assignments that I have put off (semester papers), but still don't have the motivation to do anything. It's like I can't find meaning outside of him.

I can’t deal with the stress of being myself, dealing with my past and trying to get through in a country and a world so toxic. I can’t forgive the people that fucked me over.

171,"I’m a 20 year old female currently living with my boyfriend. I work for him as a photo editor but no work is coming in right now due to the virus. I don’t know if I’ve fully faced some of the things that can be going on for me mentally, but I want to start to try and fix it. I knew there have been plenty of periods of time in my life where I felt happy, productive, motivated, and energized.

I’m currently feeling super avoidant in life. I need to get my license but avoid driving because I get all anxious and worked up. I’ve been studying life and emotional intelligence coaching for the past year or so and I want to start working with people, but I avoid that because phone calls and FaceTime makes me feel anxious and I just feel like I don’t have the energy to face any of it or move forward in life at all. I also feel like who am I to coach someone else when I’m currently feeling like such shit myself. 

I feel like I can’t take even the tiniest bit of criticism without being destroyed and beating myself up so much, and I have moments where I feel like I’m being criticized when the person tries to make it clear I shouldn’t feel that way. I’m just so sensitive and sometimes it really sucks. I’m a highly sensitive person (read more in r/hsp) and I feel stuck in this place where everything just feels like it’s too much to try and achieve.

I just feel such little motivation or energy. My only motivation right now is to not bring my boyfriend down with me. I’ll bake him cookies to show him I’m still showing up but I find anything I do throughout the day it’s really just for him. Outside of that I don’t feel any motivation at all. 

When I start to feel this way my relationship with food gets so shitty, too. I really don’t like the way I my body looks, I’m not overweight but I’m not super tight and toned. I also struggle with acne a bit and I know food affects this. I get really anxious and eventually just feeling depressed after eating certain foods like pizza or ice cream. I used to just throw it up when my anxiety about it got to that level but I live with my boyfriend now and would feel so embarrassed if he ever caught me doing that, and so then I just feel depressed about eating it in the first place. I find myself eating more when I’m not hungry when I’m not feeling great mentally. Sometimes if something comes up and makes me sad enough to take away my appetite completely I almost feel relieved that I don’t want to eat. 

I try to exercise once a day to keep my body moving but outside of that I find myself doing something for my partner or just sitting on the couch, on my phone or watching Netflix. I try to tell myself “why don’t you practice Spanish” or “why don’t you read that book you’ve been meaning to get to” but I just don’t feel the energy or motivation. I feel so weighed down and just trapped at this point. 

In high school I was a high performing AP student who was always busy and sleep deprived, working insanely hard all the time. I don’t know what happened to that person, I feel no energy or motivation and I used to work myself so hard, where did it all go? What’s happened to me? I dropped out of college because I was paying to work down a path I didn’t even want to be on but I feel like I’m stuck. I guess I just need help and advice on where to start, what to do. I know everything is connected, but I don’t know how to approach it all and put the life back into myself. I just need help clearing it all up I guess.",17Mar2020,1
