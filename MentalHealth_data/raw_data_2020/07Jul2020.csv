0,I wanna change so badly but i don’t know how to. I hate myself so much and i can’t cope with it anymore.,07Jul2020,1
1,"Best friends for almost 8 years, both currently 25. She has always had anxiety and slight control issues. I've ALWAYS been accommodating and patient with how she handles things/social interactions, but lately I don't enjoy things together anymore and it feels like her anxiety is getting much worse and creating toxic behavior.

If we want to do anything, it has to be planned out to a T from the second we leave her house to when we arrive back home. Almost like a listed itinerary with exact times. She's the only one that can drive or she gets too anxious being in the passenger seat (aka feeling out of control). She also has irrational anxieties, like needing to check the oven to make sure its off every time we leave the house (even if she hasn't cooked in 2 days). Having a panic attack while agreeing to drive all her friends at night because she's going through all the things that could go wrong (flat tire, getting into an accident and killing everyone she loves, getting arrested). Yet no one else can drive because she gets anxious so it's a lose lose. The other day we were driving to a friends together and my boyfriend and his friend were going to drive together and try to get there around the same time. When they said they were gonna leave a little later than planned she got very upset and irrationally mad. I told her them arriving later does not affect us. We aren’t their ride, we don’t need to wait for them, they can do what they want. They wanted to hang alone for an hour or two longer then meet up with everyone and they’re entitled to do that. She was pissed they couldn’t stick to the plan.

If something changes in her game plan she gets VERY stressed and grumpy and panics. Say we have to leave at 9:30 for the beach and my boyfriend is dragging a little and we don't get out the door until 9:35, she makes it known that we're running late and gets very agitated. Literally just a 5 minute difference in her plan is enough to ruin the next hour for her. Our group of friends is very go with the flow, fly by the seat of your pants type of people. Not planners AT ALL. She tries to make a plan for 10+ of us and stresses everyone out in the process, and then when things don't go perfectly to her plan she gets anxious and overwhelmed and can't talk herself down. Even when she's being invited somewhere that's not her house or town, she's trying to make a plan for everyone to make herself feel in control. But in my mind it's like, you can't tell 10 grown adults what to do every hour of the day and you can't expect things to not naturally shift and change throughout the day. You also can't try to control people when YOU'RE THE GUEST. 

I finally had enough a couple nights ago when she completely ruined my whole weekend with this over planning mentality. Tried helping her talk through things and see a lot of her thoughts were just irrational anxieties and that she shouldn't let a tiny bump in her game plan ruin the whole night with everyone. But almost an hour into calmly trying to help talk her down, she was still going on and I got frustrated. I wanted to get back to enjoying the night with our friends. I told her the way she acts not only stresses herself out, it stresses everyone else out. She doesn't handle confrontation well and ran out crying and locked herself in the bathroom. I decided to not baby her and coddle this behavior, so I let her calm down for 15 minutes and suggested we talk outside and go for a walk. She thinks i'm being a horrible friend for telling her to stop controlling everything, and for acknowledging her anxieties are irrational. She wouldn't stop crying and being over dramatic during the whole conversation (me just trying to communicate enough is enough after dealing with it for 4 days straight) so I got even more frustrated and asked her to stop crying and talk to me like an adult. She got even more mad, said I was being mean and shitty and that I was just trying to reprimand  her and so I said that was enough for the evening and we would reconnect the next day.

The whole thing was so childish i'm still wrapping my head around the situation days later. I tried reaching out today and she said she needs more time to process everything as if i'm the bad guy?? I can't handle this excess stress she is always causing. She justifies her behavior with ""well I have anxiety this is what that does to you"" I'm just trying to help her grow up a little and try to get some help to find some coping mechanisms because being a control freak and over planner isn't helping her and it certainly isn't fun to be around.",07Jul2020,1
2,"I turned a number less than 30 yesterday and had a melt down about what's next in my life and is what I'm doing really what the rest of my life will be like?

I went into work this morning and found out one of my employees passed away over the holiday weekend. Their passing was super sudden and I'm new at my job and didn't really know how to handle this. My boss, who would usually help me through these things, was on vacation and my coworkers, who usually step in, didn't know what to do either. The thing is, I didn't even like the employee that much and was planning on putting them on a performance improvement plan and take away privileges when they returned. 

People part of my usual support system are all struggling at their own battles right now and I don't feel I have the right to reach out nor to add the ""need support"" flair. This is especially because most of my agony comes from this conceitedness I have that I'm better than the job I'm in and from the guilt I have towards this employee's passing due to the disciplinary action I was shamefully excited about implementing upon their return. People keep asking me if I'm ok at work, but I'm just mad at myself for being useless and for being so heartless.",07Jul2020,1
4,"I’m never happy, I always feel like I’m unnecessary and that no one cares about me.
I’m scared of my future as I’m aware I have nothing going for me at all, I’m ugly, fat, unfunny, not smart, not athletic, and just not talented at all, I feel like everyone else has something going for themselves around me.
I’m struggling in school, I’m in year 10 and am far behind in almost everything because no matter how much I try, I have no motivation to do any work. I’m bad at all my options and am just generally unhappy with school, which is only made worse by the fact all my family thinks I’m smart and have potential I don’t want to disappoint them, but I know I will.
Also, I lack confidence in anything. I’m very insecure about my body and always feel like I am constantly judged for it.
I’m always thinking about this one girl, which isn’t interested in me and I know she never will be, which has almost brought me down for like a year. As well, I haven’t stopped thinking about this other girl for 2 years, I cared about her so much and then we just drifted, and now she is with one of my best mates.
I’ve always been unlucky in life, both with school and family, I’ve missed one of the most important times in school because of coronavirus, and also missed a lot of school time because of constant issues with surgery’s. I’ve also been unlucky as my great grandma recently passed right next to my birthday as well as might grandad being diagnosed with cancer at the same time, and around 1 month ago we got the news that it was too late and nothing can be done.

I’m scared of life and I’m scared of being a failure. But I always feel like I’m overreacting as I’m general my life has been much better than most. I feel like I’m a pussy about everything.",07Jul2020,1
5,"So lets start of with a TLDR: Dad kidnapped me as a baby exploited my grandparents to get me back. Saw my great grandad die in front of me. Sister was bullied by her ex bf for 8 years on and off. She then got raped. And i got my heart broken by a girl i adored. Theres more but thats the TLDR






So lets start of!

As a i Child i never really felt wanted by either of my parents. The Dad? Didnt care about me, he actually tried to murder me a few times. Social services were called and i was sent to my mums. She fell into the wrong crowd when me and my sister were about 4- 7 years old. She dated this real cunt of a bloke. He abused my sister  and me till social services got involved again. They didnt do anything the first time. Only asked a question about how we are feeling. I didn't know being abused was what i suffered then. The next time was the last year with my mum. She didn't care about me but i digress. The polie were involved this time cos i got drunk and ran away to my grandparents.  THEY called the cops like the absolute gods they are and i fully fucking repsect that cos by now I'd definitely be arrested or dead. I was your typical ADHD schizo kid. Smashing up everything and just a general fucking cunt of a kid. I was aggressive and if i didnt get my own way I'd smash a window or stab my self so i could basically bribe my mum into doing what I WANTED. We were moved to our grandparents and we lived with them.



The grandparents were the BEST thing that ever happened to me. They treated me like a human instead of a monster. My sister got her first few boyfriends and she then met CuntHead.We wont use his name. He was abusvive to her. very *fucking* abusive.  He hit her beat her stabbed her and sexually abused her. If she broke up he'd stalk her and get his mates to bully her and break our door locks and windows. She didn't eant the cops. When she was about 13 she went to live with my grandads daughter up country. She made friends was happy but got into drugs and missed her grandma. She *ADORED* that woman.  Anyway she stayed up there while i lived down here with my grandparents till i was 16 then chose to move back in with my mum. 


Now we're living with me and my mum. I got my first pet which i fucking love she's still going strong. I got a new lease on life.  Was feeling like a god smilimg enjoying hanging with the Homies . Didnt drink didnt smoke was a proper nice chap with my grandfathers guidance.  I get a girlfriend whos long distance.  I get my first ever breakup but i dealt with it like a absolutely champ. Jokes i got depressed but ""shrugged it off im fine bro"". Flash forward a month im still depressed and i found out my sister tried to kill herself.  We get the grandparents involved and brought her back down here with us. I gradually get over my depression but its always is there. We flash forward another few months, still depressed and I'm in college. Made some friends and fuck they're so sickk! Find out literally 2 months into the course i found out my sister was raped by my mums ex boyfriends family member. She pressed charges but lost. And she dealt with it with self harm and suicide attempts.  Flash forward she now has a friend on snapchat who is literally the best friend she ever has. She starts to live with he. She catches feelings for her brother. Not the cleanest man ( bit of a police record) but the way he treated her and us was astonishing. He had mannees and actually cared. Talked out stuff with her and refused to sleep on a argument till they have sorted it. She moves in with him and is happy as fuck and i buy a dog for myself and geta drug addiction


I'm now 19 and finally get another girlfriend. She was perfect. I was truly in love with her but if fell flat. She couldn't accept that i didnt like her flirting with her friends ( she called them sexy and shit) while i was her bf and she was living with me. She and I couldn't fix a arguement of me asking her to stop so we ended. Pretty fucking badly but I'm the asshole in that situation. Everything and i mean EVERYTHING i did reminded me of her and i just couldn't cope. She meant everything to me and i just couldn't forget her. I finally patched things with her and we agreed to just not stay in contact. I still fucking miss her. After a few months I finally start to get over her till i bump into her with a friend. I'm currently severely depressed. Didn't shower or anything till i had to meet my friends which by this i was just saying im busy all the time but just stayed kn bed wanting to just be gone.  I start to remember all the memories we did and she spoke to me. She apologised of what she did and i said im sorry as well. She hugged me and i really wish i just didn't go out cos this absofuckinglutely broke me. 

Now, everything i do theres always a lil voice saying just off yourself you dont deserve this shitty life. Blah blah blah. We're only a few days after she hugged me and I'm just crippled.  The voice is literally screaming now and i keep breaking down. I feel like my whole lofe is a failure. I couldn't protect my sister. My  first ex was a POS and i still missed her. I got kicked out of college cos i didnt turn up ( my fault shoulda rung and said i was having a bad time). My ex from a couple weeks ago literally ripped out my heart and burnt it alive. All after i let down my guard down for years. I felt like shit hell i still do. I keep tying nooses and fiddling with the knives in the kitchen debating slitting my throat and hanging in the woods. I don't know what to do with life and i just don't want to be alive.  I just want to.be gone and i can't explain that to my friends without feeling like a burden

6,"Hi, so I’ll keep this short. Basically over the last two years I’ve had a lot of big changes. I’ve changed medication, lost weight, changed diets, etc. the world has also been pretty wild over these past seven months. Needless to say, my mental health is considerable worse. I get randomly paranoid and obsessively, I’ve developed compulsive traits (both mental and psychical) and I have to be extremely careful not to see something that triggers an panic/anxiety attack. It’s becoming harder and harder to socialize because any little minor thing will throw me into an anxiety spiral. Simply put: I’m exhausted. I’ve already had to get off social media (for the most part) because people online trigger my social phobias. I’m currently speaking to a doctor to get these issues sorted out, but in the meantime, I’m curious to know if there’s anything I can do to soothe this. These issues are getting out of my control and I just want some rest. I don’t need anything super in-depth or deep, I just am curious about what y’all do to cope when you’re going through hard mental periods. Thank you.",07Jul2020,2
7,"So I'm a really chill guy and I keep to myself a lot, but I have great friends and I'm happy. I feel like people just assume that I'm depressed and on the verge of suicide. A while ago I put on my snapchat story that I was at a mental hospital, but I was there for one of my brother's friends, not me. A lot people thought I was there because I tried killing myself and this girl who I rarely talk to sent me entire paragraphs explaining why I'm worth living and that I can talk to her if I need help after I told her that I'm fine. I feel like so many people talk to me simply because they think I'm depressed, and I notice that I'm always treated like an injured child by teachers, girls, etc. and they always check up on me and make sure I'm okay. I get that that's really amazing that people can do that, but it just makes me feel so uncomfortable and honestly awful because I'm not suicidal or depressed, and it makes me feel like anytime people try to be friends with me, anytime teachers talk to me, they're just trying to make me feel not alone. I've dealt with this problem since probably 8th grade and I don't know how to appear not suicidal?",07Jul2020,1
9,"I've been on working doses of an antidepressant and ADHD medication that have been helpful in the previous months but the last two weeks I've been in a depressive rut that I can't overcome. Not only has the depression been bad, but it's brought with it intense fatigue where I constantly need a nap and even the thought of walking to check my mailbox is exhausting. In addition to the physical fatigue, I broke up with my partner a couple months ago and was recently rejected by someone I have long since liked (right before these two weeks started), so loneliness has been a constant companion. I've called to set up an appointment with my doctor, but the soonest they can get me in is late August.

Any thoughts on how to get back to being my happy, energetic self? I'm still running three times a week but beyond that getting out and being active has been tiring.",07Jul2020,1
10,"I’ve been dealing with depression for years and developed a habit for oversleeping. I assumed it was a side effect of medication and switched three times; and recently cut my medication all together. But I still find myself sleeping almost 16 hours a day.

11,"This was a facebook status I had to cut and paste here instead. This is how scary close I am to breaking down to 200 people on Facebook. I dont want to do this to them. I dont want to do this to reddit either, but I'm even more of a nobody on here..  I guess that's why my last post wasn't read either on here.. kinda like this one probably. Haha I'm so lonely 


Sure I love being told I'm a peice of shit everyday. Sure, I love being told im useless everyday. And I extra love when I'm compared to not being able to hold a ""normal"" conversation every fucking day. I'm fucking tired of being told im lazy when I have fucking spinobidida and scoliosis. My fucking stomach is getting crushed by my god damn spine. I can't fucking eat more than a childs amount of food at a time. You all made fun of me tho for being skinny tho thanks friends. You try and going one month on my diet and see if you can have the energy to move. I fucking cant even get a fucking good job once in a while. I'm fucking slowly dying anyway, but I'll work harder and tell myself I'll be ok!! Thanks guys! Oh and I'm sorry your depressed too, I am. It fucking sucks. fucking tired of it. I fucking begged for some form of compassion because I dont want to fucking admit what I have to fucking deal with on a daily fucking basis and I'm sorry


Fuck this shit, I'm fucking tired of this fucking disgusting shit and I'm fucking NOT able to physically do anything fucking about it right now.

I'm fucking tired. I'm fucking tired. I'm fucking tired. 
I'm tired of my head and I want out. I'm a psycho and I'm aware of the road of loneliness I'm headed down.

But god damn is it better than being constantly lied to. Constantly told theres still better out there. Constantly told I'm not a motivated individual even though it's impossible to build something with only my heart involved.

I'm tired of being told I'm the one that's supposed to lead. I'm fucking tired of being told I'm the one that's supposed to be a man but then getting asked for space in return.

I'm tired of putting my emotions on the table only to not find out about someone 2 years down the road.

I'm tired of being told I can depend on family yet they are the one who bashed my head in and sent me to the hospital

I'm tired of being monogamous and finding out your fiance with 2 kids of 7 years admits shes polyamorous and when the new girl comes into my life 6 months down the road, she promised she was different but told me 2 years ago she was polyamorous. Then I tried for a year and she kicked me out homeless right before the coronavirus.

I get run out of everyone's lives so fast and obviously its because my mental health, but fuck. Governments got to get rid of the stigma of ""oh ask for help"" because what in the fuck does it do but have people tell you that it's going to be ok and then just dissapear? Lol. Where's the friends I drove around for free all those years in highschool. Now that I'm homeless none of them show up lol

Wheres my friends when i constantly put their well being before mine? Wheres my friends when i paid for whatever they wanted without asking to be repaid?

Wheres my friend i once drove to woodstock during college because he missed his mom? Oh and drove home without asking for gas money and went back a week later to pick him up.

Why am I always told I should stop being me so I can stop being depressed? How about some of you show compassion like you all say you do in all these fucking statuses of world events you all seem to seem ""worthy of a profile picture banner""

I was told by someone that I shouldnt be upset no one came to my aid because you dont know their situation.
Yeh I do get that, but shit there are some of you on here I really really thought I'd at least get a message from by now.

I'm tired of being the first to always offer myself to be fucked in the end.

I dont know what this status is about but I know it's what constantly fucks with my head


I'm not a good person and you should delete me off facebook and be done with it, please. I'm just done with my own personal bullshit",07Jul2020,1
13,"[TW: self harm, depression]

After 4 years of not wanting to hurt myself anymore... I finally really want to start self harming again.
I want to feel the pain again so I can feel something.

I thought about cutting my thigh with my knife, but resorted to hitting my knee instead.
I'm so depressed and lonely... only 17. I have no one I can talk to.

My parents don't understand the full extent of my depression and Bipolar 2 disorder. They believe it's alright to leave an emotionally unstable depressed person by themselves and make it feel like it's their fault their depressed. 

I cant talk to my mom about any of it because she is so double sided on my mental health. She'll act all sweet one moment when I'm having a breakdown and then the next breakdown she's harsh. 

I cant take it any longer, I just want consistancy in people. I want a happy life. I want some reassurance in my family, but my life has become miserable and lonely. For the last hour the only thing I've been able to feel is the tight squeezing of the heartache in my chest. It makes my finger numb. I was sure I was going to end up having a heart attack.

I've been strong for so long... but everyone just sees me as weak. They think that back when I was pretending to be happy I was strong, even though that was when i was the weakest. I feel so alone. My thoughts are all over the place and it feels as though I'm just venting now... but I yearn so much for someone to call me strong or to acknowledge my hardships and see that I am trying... and not that I'm just some shitty little brat.

I dont want to hurt myself... to see bruises or scars. But I dont know what to do. It gives me a high, if only for a moment. Please help.",07Jul2020,2
14,"Like many of us have posted here we’ve all dealt with our own stuff. I don’t wanna be a burden to my family because they have great burdens of their own. I grew up in a very poor household and I’ve dealt with my fair share of bad experiences and turmoil, what have you. My only hope in life is to help others because I know what it feels like, But you can’t help other people if you can’t help yourself. I have been on and off drinking again and I know it’s not making it any better it’s only making it worse but I can’t control myself even though as soon as I grab the drink I know it’s the wrong thing to do but my body is just taking over and I really can’t stop it. E ven saying this out loud I feel like it’s a crazy thing to say it’s insane I don’t know why this is happening I am not one who Takes these things very lightly. I know it’s super easy to say just don’t drink or just have self-control or whatever because these are the things that I would be telling to my friends if they were saying these same things to me. I am usually the one who is giving out advice unfortunately I am not in this position right now. I’ve been recently seeking mental help in my local area.Unfortunately after receiving said help my therapist was unknowingly by anyoneThe I have a contact with put on an undetermined on the time leave. I was scheduled a new therapist which actually is not bad whatsoever. But that being said with my own circumstances I know that I need more therapy because certain things have arisen I am not capable of really dealing with once a week. I just was able to get my life back in order by getting a job and an apartment so on and so forth. Now I feel like I need more help than a full-time job as a general manager of a restaurant will allow. I don’t know what to do at this point.

25,"This is my first post anywhere on reddit, so I’d like to start with an apology of this is a bit messy. When I was a young kid, I was really paranoid. I’d constantly look over my shoulder and feel like someone was following me. For some more detailed examples, when I slept, I worried someone was going to break into my house and stab me. I grew into the habit of making sure all doors and windows are locked locked before bed, sometimes multiple times. When I was real young, I had to sleep in a bed with my mom because I didn’t have a room, so I would try to sleep in a position as close to her and as flat against the bed as possible, as well as under the covers so if someone came in I’d be able to somehow surprise them and fight them off. I’d have nightmares about getting shot or stabbed or injured in some form. When I was in the car, I was thinking of bizarre situations such as if the car were to get shot at. I’d sit with my head below the windows and keep my eye on my brother so if something, for whatever reason did happen, I could try to pull him down. I’m currently now a teenager (from U.S btw) and while I don’t worry about getting shot in the car anymore, I will get really worried over car accidents (especially on highways during longer rides) and sometimes will end up keeping an eye on the cars around when my parents are driving. At night I listen closely to footsteps to make sure it’s one of my family members or pets. I am so used to thinking that I’m going to die that I have a trouble being motivated, and It’s hard to think about future plans.

29,"So I’m not sure where to start but I just need to get this off my chest. I’m terrified of my dad point blank. Even as 21 year old I still feel this way. He’s never hit me growing up but when I was younger whenever I made (usually) careless mistakes I was scolded harshly and sometimes made to feel so guilty that I was too afraid to even make that same mistake. There’s a couple of scenarios I remember that I’ll always remember but I’ll just use one as an example. 

When I was in 5th grade I was asked to help organize some papers along with other kids. The counselor that asked us said to put our certificates (from our graduation ceremony) together on a filing cabinet to keep safe,  so I did and we were organizing for a while and went back to class. I assumed she’d give them back to us because she never said to take them when we left or whatever I just assumed that she would keep them safe and give it back the next day. So fast forward and my dad picks me up after school and he was in a good mood and being a kid I basically told him every detail of my day including me leaving my certificate with the counselor. He got angry immediately and was like “you lost it!?”. I can’t remember exactly what he said but just that I was irresponsible while raising his voice. I was trying to explain that I didn’t and tried to tell him exactly what happened, but he didn’t let me finish. I just shut down and didn’t look at him trying to hold back tears. I went to my room to cry and I didn’t leave for a while I guess because my dad came in later with my laundry to put in the sock drawer. I was obviously still teary eyes because he looked at me and said “you’re still crying?”. This memory is burned into my brain and I wish I could forget it. 

Nowadays I’m 21 years old trying to finish my certification to teach art and I’m still afraid of him because of how mad he gets. I get up late and I’m also taking a summer class so I don’t start on hw until the afternoon. My schedule is workout, shower, eat, chores, homework and draw. I try to schedule my time almost everyday to draw because I’m trying to grow my skills. Today he got to the vacuum before I could get to it, which I usually do. I was in the shower and I was a little confused that he wouldn’t just wait for me or ask if I could vacuum. I guess I should’ve said something but tbh I’m afraid of even asking. He won’t ask me either because he has this philosophy where he shouldn’t have to ask for us to do something and that we should do it without being asked to. Basically it spiraled into him cussing out loud in his room because of something but I always assume it’s me because I was doing homework instead of chores. Then I realized that my whole relationship with him is mostly just anxiety and fear. 

I always try to be one step ahead of him so that he won’t get mad. I’m afraid to ask him because I have this fear that he’ll just start saying bad things about me or that he’ll be in a bad mood. I’m always walking on eggshells with him. Especially because he’s retired so it’s just me and him most of the day until my mom and sister come back from work. I can’t even walk past him without feeling at least a little tense and with my head down. When he’s mad I feel like I’m a kid again I just freeze and hold my breath. All I want to do is hide in my closet like I did normally as a kid. When he leaves for errands I feel a sense of relief, when he comes back I get nervous again. When I do make a mistake I’m terrified of asking him for help with something (like car issues usually.) Even with chores I’m sometimes afraid to do them because he might say I’m doing it wrong or something. I just always think he’s judging me all the time from afar. I sometimes blame myself and feel like I’m a burden. 

I never talk about it with my family because they probably would say I’m being over dramatic and that I should just do the chores and nothing would happen. They know that he needs to calm down but nothing is done about it. We’ve honestly just accepted it that it’s just the way he is. I just needed to express my thoughts. Thanks to anyone sticking around.",07Jul2020,1
30,"I always feel low nowadays, and I don’t quite yet have a grasp as to why I’m feeling like that. There are a number of topics that really gets me down. Love, Friends, family, career and god knows what else. Don’t really feel motivated to do anything in life. Just sit and play games and that’s pretty much what I’m doing. 

This results in fuckall sleep patterns, disturbed sleep, mood swings and most importantly absolute lack of motivation. Just feel like odds are stacked against me in every way possible. And cherry on the top is I live in a society where mental health is a joke. My own family just says take a day and then get better. I have no clue as to what to do. Even if I take up an activity it lasts for 3-5 days and then I relapse into the same cycle again. Sometimes I just feel I have no clue about what’s going on and I’m stuck in a middle of an absolute crisis. 

Honestly I don’t even know why I’m posting here, but I thought I might as well write it out somewhere and maybe get some sort of validation because I’m sick and tired in general for living like this in a constant state of tension and panic and putting up a face for the people who care for me.

31,"I've been on mental health holds twice this year, and spending time in a mental hospital is basically like prison, and I've been in the ER involuntarily five times now because of suicidal ideation, so I have to wonder why having mental illness and self harm issues leads to basically being arrested just for expressing or trying self harm.  Recently I have discussed wanting to end my life in response to the COVID-19 measures and my own GP told me to go to an ER, despite him knowing I refuse to wear a mask in any situation and so the ER would just turn me away.  He suggested this knowing I've been involuntarily held several times and that it was not a good experience for me, and I imagine not for anyone else, and others I've talked to even said they wanted to call a wellness check on me and blamed bipolar for my desire to end my life in response to ""a mild inconvenience"" (yeah right).

I’ve only been noticing this going on for the past two years at most, but much much more frequently in the past couple months. Before, it would be maybe once every few months, but today it happened three times that I remember 

I’m not sure how to explain it best, I know that it’s not a hallucination (I think) because the thing that is moving is an actual physical item. The first time I noticed it today, I was outside gardening and out of the corner of my eye it looked like a piece of mulch was moving very slowly, but when I looked it was sitting completely still. There was no wind at all and it was on flat ground so it’s extremely unlikely that it actually moved at all. The most recent time was when I was looking at my laptop with a notebook sitting beside it, and It looked like a circle on my paper had twitched. 

I’m sort of starting to get concerned that something could be wrong, it’s most likely due to a bad sleep schedule or stress , but I can’t shake the idea that it could be a brain tumor or something

I knew they had some issues with drugs in the past and had shown some signs of some sort of mental health disorder since they lived with my immediate family for a year when I was 14 (am 20 now). I never really knew the full extent of it since they moved a couple states away. However I had heard from my mom that something had happened and that my aunt had posted about it on Facebook. So I looked into it found out their social media accounts were deactivated and found out they had been dissociative for a few weeks. I found out the whole story which I won’t share since it’s not mine to share however it seems they have gotten the help they need for the immediate future however I don’t know how to bring this up to my parents as they are clueless of what actually transpired. As well as how to offer support to their parents/10 brothers and sisters. Where do I go from here?

36,"This is going to be extremely scattered, probably just random thoughts that are constantly going through my mind. Daily. Regularly. Non stop. In no particular order. 

I hate my life
Everything sucks
I feel nothing
I hate everybody
What’s the point
Fuck you bitch
I’m hungry but don’t feel like eating 
I don’t want to do shit, and I don’t even want to do that. 
Talking to people or doctors don’t do a thing because honestly they don’t know you, will never really know you or be able to fully emphasize with you or what you feel. They’ll just go off some generic bullshit recommendation regarding situations and experiences they’ve been through/studied/worked for others feeling the same. It’s bullshit. You’ll never tell me something I haven’t thought of to get out of this black hole of a feeling. 
Fuck everything
I have kids and they’re the only reason I haven’t offed myself. So that basically makes me feel more trapped and stuck. 
I have my son every other week, I’m trapped in a state I’ve been in my whole life and I really want to move but I can’t. Because if I did(to make a little happiness in my life) I’d end up feeling the same if not worse because I left him for my own wants/needs. So fuck me, I’m fucked and trapped here. I’ll feel like shit wherever I go without him. 
He’s all that keeps me here.
I feel fake as fuck because I have to pretend to be happy and good and do things I wouldn’t be doing if he wasn’t around. Which in return makes me feel even shittier when he leaves for the week. 
I don’t enjoy one single thing I used to be passionate about anymore. All my hobbies have disappeared.
I don’t want to eat
I don’t want to sleep
I don’t want to think
I don’t want to breathe
I don’t want to talk
I don’t want to listen
I don’t want to do anything 
Not doing anything makes it even worse so then I try to do something but fuck that, because doing anything fucking blows. No point. 
Please run me off the road and crash my shit into the biggest tree and full send my ass through the windshield. 
Ima go to sleep. Can’t sleep.
I’ll play some video games. Boring.
Watch tv. Who cares.
Go fishing. Wow fish
I need to eat. Why so you can shit.
You need medication. Ok autopilot(I already am)
I honestly just have no clue what or how to do this for another 30 years. 
What is the point? 
I don’t smile, I don’t laugh, I don’t care.

Ive seen wonderful loving responses to them, but also people who say they are liars and are looking for attention. I feel pretty comfortable here and just wanted to talk about my experience and how it makes me feel. So i was dating this guy and all together we dated for like 5 years. After we had been dating for like a year and im sorry if this like too graphic but i told him that sexually i was starting to feel more comfortable with him because i had lost my virginity to him and i was really self conscious so i just felt more comfortable trying new things and thats when he started to do anal with me but i never really said yes do this and i also never said no while it was happening. So to me thats my own fault and i dont consider that rape. But after about 3 years of dating we were hanging out in his room and he kept trying to like finger me and i told him no i wasnt in the mood but he shoved me and pinned me down i was still saying like no i really dont want to. He kept taking of my pants and started having sex with me.. I was kicking and saying no and i started crying.. He wouldnt stop until i hit him and he just kinda stared at me and i told him i was serious and i broke down. He never really said sorry and it didnt happen again. After that ive just kind of felt like i shouldnt say things during sex or even if things bothered me. He was kinda neglectful like would let me cry myself to sleep most nights. He cheated on me.. Idk thats a bit off topic. But i just felt like my feelings didnt matter in any situation. In my new relationship i still get like anxious and stressed when it comes to our sex life. I feel very uncomfortable at times and feel like i have to give in even if i dont want to. Anyways, i basically just cant convince myself i was raped because it was my boyfriend at the time and that maybe i didnt do enough to stop it. Im just looking for people to hear this and let me know if i was or wasnt raped...

39,"I started cutting myself when I was 14. It got worse through my teenage years, especially towards the end of my uni days. Things got better afterwards, when I started working. Although there are still occassions when I just lose it and start cutting again. 

Bottom line is, I have a lot of scars on my wrist. I'm careful about it though, in the sense that I always cut on a specific place. On my wrist, underneath my watch. It's very convenient because I always wear a watch when I'm around people.

The past few months have been rough on me, however. I was back to cutting myself. Big time.

So now my scars have piled up. I still use an x-acto knife that I've been using for a while now. It used to serve me well, delivering clean cuts. But now, when I cut myself, I don't bleed as much. I try to apply more force to it but I seldom get the performance I used to get. The wounds still hurt, and I still get a peak of the surface below my skin. But the lack of blood isn't as satisfying as before, I end up not wantimg to cut more and cut deeper...

41,"This probably sounds like a strange/annoying question and I've been going back and forth on if I should even post anything, but I feel like I need to because I'm starting to feel like I'm alone in this and helpless. 

I'm 23 years old, and for as long as I can remember, I have always had a ""guilty conscience"". But the problem is that it's almost never warranted. I'm not saying I'm a perfect person by any means and that I havent done things in my life to feel guilty about just like anyone else, but ive always had a problem with feeling overwhelming guilty even when I didnt do anything to feel guilty over. For example, I will be sick and have to call into work, and the overwhelming guilt I feel over the thought of letting people down and having people be angry with me will eat me alive for the entire day. I have had divorced parents since I was young, and still to this day when I need to choose whether I want to stay the night at my mom or dads house, I will feel so guilty about whatever choice I make that I cry and feel guilty for days, or even weeks. I know logically in my head that I did not do anything wrong in most of these situations and that I am overthinking, but I still cant shut these feelings down. Its starting to really take a toll on my life and happiness and becoming exhausting. I don't know how to go on with making big decisions in my life when I cant do simple things without feeling crippling guilt for no reason. And it doesnt help that I was just diagnosed with endometriosis, which I feel guilty about in my relationship now. 

So, I guess my question is, does anyone else experience this? Is it part of a larger mental health issue that I am just not aware of?

46,"Lately, I've been getting deja vu a lot.

Okay, okay, I know. Deja vu is a perfectly normal thing to experience from time to time. But this feels different.

I know it sounds crazy, and I'm mostly posting this to get my thoughts out and have it all written out, because I seem to always forget what's happening. I've always had deja vu, like everyone else. But in the past several months, things have... changed. It keeps happening more and more, and it's usually not even about the mundane things that I could brush off as coincidence. There are times in which it happens that I KNOW that's never happened before, and nothing similar has ever even happened. Things that would have been impossible to happen before. Oddly specific things that I just can't shake the feeling I've lived and experienced before. Series of oddly specific things that seem far too strangely familiar to just be deja vu.

It happened again today. I was on tinder, of all places. I'd only made an account two days ago, and had never gone on it or any similar app in my entire life. I got a match, and it wasn't that the person just looked familiar, but when I saw my screen with all my matches and that specific screen with those specific messages from those specific people in that specific order felt far too familiar for the third day of using it. It was strange to say the least. Then I happened to glance over to my window, and saw my phone cord unplugged and draped over the cord of my fan in my window next to my guitar.

It seems stupid. Even writing this, I know it seems absolutely ridiculous. But I've only been living in this apartment for 6 months. Only within the last few days bought that fan for my window, and apart from today, the cord was always plugged into my wall, far away from the window. This was the only time I would have seen that specific detail, and looking around my room... look I know I'd be used to living here. I know my room would seem familiar. But it wasn't just the room it was just all these tiny details of how everything was placed. My room was a little messy, and though some of the things in it had only today entered my home, but I swear all happened before, and everything had been exactly where it was in that moment.

I began to feel like I was losing it. But then I started to remember the other times this has happened. All the times in the last several months where I experienced this inexplicable sense of oddly specific deja vu. Far too many times to be considered normal. Far too many times not to question why or how it was happening so often. But I'd somehow forgotten, and so quickly, as it seemed. I'd felt like this countless times before, questioning my sanity, and wondering if I was starting to lose my mind. How could I have forgotten that so easily? How had I managed to forget questioning whether I was going crazy many times in each of the last several months?

Even writing this, I feel like I've done this before. I feel like I've written this exact post several times over and posted it to this exact subreddit. But I haven't. I KNOW I haven't.

And all this while, I feel like something's going to happen on August 20th. I first got the... premonitions, I suppose, back in January. In all that time, I keep feeling like something's going to happen on August 20th. I *know* it. It feels like some animalistic instinct, like when birds and insects all flee from an area just before disaster strikes. Could it be connected?

I can't help thinking of those speculations on what hell might be like. Hell has never been included in my beliefs, but the idea of reliving a moment, or some span of time, over and over and over again seems all too similar. Even though, despite everything, my life isn't too terrible right now, and I haven't done anything to deserve it, I can't help but wonder if I might be in hell. Is August 20th the day I die? Or is it something bigger? Some cataclysmic event that humanity as a whole is repeating and these are the memories bleeding through from past repeats.

I hope I can find answers. I honestly have no idea if there's something bizarre happening here or if I am, indeed, simply losing my mind. There's no history of schizophrenia or anything of the sort in my family, and until this began to happen and outside of these experiences, there has been nothing to lead me to believe I'm going crazy. I don't know which option would be better- if I was going crazy or if I'm right about all this and something strange is going on.

I'm not asking for medical advice, I'll give you some background and want to know what coping mechanisms work for you.

I had a workplace trauma in January and was medicated with 20mg valium and built to 150mg Zoloft

I've been cutting down the last 3 weeks and have been off Zoloft for 3 days. Valium is down to 1 tablet a day of 5mg

My brain hurts and I'm having crying fits of frustration over nothing. The brain zaps and pain seem to be normal from what I've researched.

My doctor has just told me to take a week off work she knows, I was never depressed just bad anxiety. She admits I've cut down too quick but I don't want to be medicated any more. I'm seeing a new psychiatrist on the 17th as I'm suspected to have undiagnosed ADHD and wanted to be drug free for that appointment so I can't start new treatment if necessary.

What do you do when you just want to lay on the couch and cry over nothing? 
How do you occupy yourself?
How to be kind to yourself?
How do I get through the next few days?

49,"So a little backstory: I've self-harmed on-off for many years starting since I was 15, I've had periods when I don't that have lasted for more than a year and then I fall off the wagon again. Having a semi-abusive boyfriend trough ages 16-20 didn't help either. Been clean since February for now so that's good I suppose.

I haven't really been to the doctor's except seeing a psychologist for a little bit a couple years ago (did nothing for me)  and then quite recently talking to the therapist at school  (via e-mail) who kind of confirmed my self-diagnosed depression but I wasn't able to actually start sessions with her because of the pandemic. 

So mostly I have some times when I'm okay and have energy and then I have times when getting out of the bed is the most difficult part of the day, I sleep more than usual and I can't get anything done. The worst bits are when I can't even motivate myself to do school stuff because the voice inside of me is saying that it's pointless. At these times pretty much the only thing I can do is drag myself to work because it's literally not possible for me to just not show up. Getting out of bed sometimes is the biggest accomplishment of the day. 

Lately I've been thinking about calling my doctor and get an appointment to a therapist trough her, so I'd get an actual diagnosis and also treatment. But I'm a bit scared that they'll just prescribe me some meds and then send me on my merry way. And I really don't want to take some random pills and then get sad again when the prescription ends. 

So just many questions here: 1) should I just hang in there and hope things get better once I graduate (o do believe that the biggest factor of my ""depression"" is university) ? 2) if I will take the pills - do they really help or will I have to be on medication for the rest of my life? 3) are there or does anybody have experience with ""natural/plant based"" medication?

So I’ll cut to the chase. I am a nurse in New York City, and a doctoral candidate in nursing practice, specifically in psychiatry. New York State hospitals are rapidly shutting down psych units and claiming it’s because of covid, even though my hospital hasn’t seen a symptomatic covid patient in about a month. In fact, the covid units are empty. I am currently working with a prominent nurse’s union, some of my professors and other nurses and doctoral candidates to do something about this. I can’t sleep at night knowing my patients are suffering both horrible injustices and serious mental illnesses. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a meeting with a NYS senator this week, and I know that this is short notice, but if anyone has a story about how they or a family member needed/needs acute psychiatric care/hospitalization, and cannot get it because psych patients are being pushed out of ER’s etc. The cause could use your help. Feel free to DM me. If you have a story, something you would like to tell a public official in order to help us to reopen these desperately needed psych units, please come forward and message me.

Personally, I know of so many overdoses, suicides, and crises that are happening right now. People can’t get the help they need and deserve. I’m doing my best to fight for these people. Mental health matters. If you have a story, first-hand accounts are incredibly powerful. I would be more grateful than I can express for your courage and willingness to stand up and say that you, or a friend, or family member is suffering and cannot receive help.

It is preferable if you live in The Bronx or Manhattan, as these are the locations that are under this elected official’s jurisdiction and are the populations that this particular hospital system serves.

In march 2020 i lost my grandmother to cancer and had to miss the funeral due to Covid-19, since then my mental health dropped, i couldn’t get out of bed most days for the best part of 2 months, during this time i attempted an OD twice, and have self-harmed several times, then i was getting better, then i lost my close friend to suicide, who i was speaking to the night before trying to stop him and he promised me he wouldn’t and still did, since then i’ve been on a downhill drop again, i’ve self harmed a lot again and considered suicide again, however this isn’t all, i recently came out as bisexual to my family and since then my stepfather has completely ignored me and refuses to speak to me, as well as this i went out with my friends, and they held me down and “beat the gay out of me”, i considered it a joke but the more i think about it the less i believe that, they also know about my struggles and recently told me to get over myself as i “don’t even have mental health issues and making it up to get attention and use it as an excuse so i don’t have to go out with them”, because of all of this i just feel so broken inside and i can’t seem to find a reason to stay alive anymore, i apologise for the long read.",07Jul2020,1

These examples are going to sound weird, but its all I got. I started forgetting things. I can't remember clearly anymore, everything is fuzz. I watched the entire set of marvel movies with my family pretty recently, and I can remember none of it, except that there's something called vibranium in Black Panther. (Sorry, I know its weird.) I also was watching Doctor Who with my sister and I used to be able to quote things, and remember everything that happened, then I slowly started forgetting characters, including main companions and villains, and major plot elements.

56,"Hi guys, since the day my girlfriend broke up with me of 3 years. Most days i wake up feeling useless and unworthy. It’s been a year now since break up. I remember first couple months after break up i was working 6-7 days a week to make myself feel worthy.. i was killing myself by doing that. I deal with anxiety and depression. I just woke up at 5:30 am with a bad dream of her being with someone else and feeling useless about myself, unworthy. 

After the breakup i became like this. What would you recommend i do? I feel really low and I wanna feel worthy of myself and move on.

61,"So for the past 6 months i’ve been lashing out randomly for small things that go wrong, or if someone says/does something to irritate me, i go OFF. i’ve never had problems with anger or lashing out. shortly i turned 11, i was diagnosed with pretty bad depression, epilepsy, and a couple other health issues. i started feeling very depressed and emotions id never felt before. lonely, miserable, sad, , hopeless and thinking about death/suicide a lot. then i was put on medications to treat other health issues with side effects being depression even though i already had it. all my emotions felt amplified no matter what i was feeling. this was during summer before entering middle school. my parents were putting me in one where i knew nobody. school was the last thing on my mind. i was too depressed and miserable to care, thus leading to never make friends in middle school and failing classes. this continued all throughout middle school until i switched to online for most of high school. i attended freshman year but it was too much for me. i did however make 2 amazing friends and we’re still super close. so for years i was terribly depressed with no emotional outlet other than family who claimed i was just being dramatic and missed out on having friends, parties, going out, and normal stuff teens do. i was at home in bed either crying or playing video games to distract me from my issues. i’m 17 now and i haven’t been depressed for almost 2 years. it feels so good. i was in mental pain for so long i almost didn’t want to seek help. depression became my security blanket. leaving would mean i’d have to enter the real world and couldn’t just stay in my little toxic bubble. all this led to very low self esteem that i’ve been gradually rebuilding over years and getting better but lately i’ve suddenly been lashing out once or twice a month over everything. and now with this whole pandemic i’m trapped inside all day and im scared to return to where i used to be. i feel like i could explode with rage and break thing sometimes. is this anger from built up repression for years just now surfacing due to my depression and missing out on middle school and high school life? other than that ive been “normal”. what should i do?",07Jul2020,1

63,"Hello. Sorry if my English is not perfect. 

When I was a child, my mother try to teach me four languages. It was a good choice she made. We had to move many times. Speaking four language help me a lot. I can speak four languages but not all fluent.  I have a hard time to remember words and grammar. It is even for my native language. Sometimes I say the right word then mess up. It is hard for me to always remember. I can read English very well. I can not write or speak English well. This is a problem sometimes when I speak of my mental health.

It has been very hard talking about mental health. Many people do not understand what I am try to say. It means I have to repeat myself many times. I try to write my mental health but people do not understand that too. It is very hard to talk. My best friend understand what I am saying a lot. But she does not understand all of the time.

If I speak in my native language it is hard too. Many words are lost in my mind. It is hard to speak it sometimes. There are many words in English that I do not know in Cambodian, Chinese, or Jarai. There are some words I do not know in English. People say to use Google to translate but the translates do not always make it right. Sometimes the words are not equal or make sense. My mental health is worse by the languages. I would want to forget one language to be better in another. 

When I am sad I hurt myself. I do not think I do it in the bad way. When I hurt myself I pinch my arm. Sometimes my arm gets a bruise or it gets blooded. I do not do this all of the time. I only do this if I am very sad. A lot of the time I cry and sleep. I sleep many days for a long time.

 I live in a small town. People are mean to me for many reasons. I do not look like the people in the town. My voice is different. It is hard for me to speak. My brain is different. I do not understand what a lot of people do. I do not feel romance or sex the same way. People think I am a freak for being a boy who is not wanting sex. People say mean things about me because I have not kissed a girl. I do not need to kiss a girl for people to be nice to me. 

It was very hard moving to America. I did not get to say goodbye to my friends. Many people of my family do not live here. I do not think I will ever see my friends or my family again. That make me sad. I think about them a lot. To think about them makes me cry. I cry every night for them. When I google it said I have depression. That feels okay for me. It said many other things too. Anxiety. Post traumatic stress disorder. It said I may have the ADHD and OCD. I do not know if I have any of it. It said to talk to a doctor about them. I do not think I can go to the doctor. My mom does not have extra money. She provide all things for us now. 

It is difficult to know many people will not understand me. It is sad that many people will not learn or help me learn that way we can be friends. I want good friends in my life. I love the friends I have but they do not always understand. They support me always. But they do not know my hard life. Many thing happened that I do not like to talk about. It hurts me too much to speak. I want to get help but I do not think I can. That is okay. I will still live. My mom would be very sad if I did die. I can not make her sad. I will live for her and the many nice people I know. I will live for my neighbor that I like very much. Not in a romance way. I like her as a friend I think. She is very kind. I like kind people.

64,"Today my girlfriend went out with her friend and they had a good time doing whatever it was they did. She didn’t respond to me for two hours, and she could have literally done whatever she wanted because none of what she did was posted anywhere. Somehow, in my mind, I immediately worry that she may be cheating on me. Yet I know she would never do that because I was her first kiss, boyfriend, as well as many other firsts. She always tells me everything she does, but for some reason I cannot trust her. Every time I talk to my father I always think he’s trying to condemn me or put me down. But I know he’s just trying to give advice. But I also feel like he just wants to criticize me all the time. Whenever I hangout with my friends, they always point out the stupid shit I do and laugh.

Basically, I have serious trust issues and I have no idea why, especially when I consciously and can logically understand that none of these feelings make sense.

65,"Last year I was diagnosed with depression. Pills do not work or they all make me obnoxiously tired, alcohol definitely doesn’t either and I suspect I may need to give that up during my low points or I’ll be facing addiction issues as well. I believe my depression manic if that’s still a thing as I go through really high points where I’m constantly improving and pushing myself, then there are the low points that are really low and I spend all my time binging shows, obsessing over people, or scrolling through my phone. I try to be creative at least but that only lasts a few days then sizzles until much later when I’m crying on the floor about something stupid and realize it is stupid so I tell myself I should be more productive. 

I live in AZ where the devil has us in an oven and notice that summer is by far my worst time of the year because in the winter I can walk or hike which usually helps me process my feelings in a healthy manner. In the heat I ‘melt’ as my friend likes to say in a literal and mental manner and all of my hard work on self improvement dissipates.... No more yoga, no more YouTube work out videos or running laps in the pool, just mush trying to function. Doesn’t help that my new job is soulless and the most stressful work I’ve ever done in my life so I feel the need to turn off my brain.

The only good thing I do is meditate on the week days. Therapy is too expensive and I have used all of my free sessions with work. What are things I can do to get out of my funks, to push myself to not turn into a blob and be productive? I am a single mom whose daughter’s father left state to start a new family without supporting her as well as I have started dating for the first time in 3 years and have met this amazing person who holds space for me during my bad times. I wonder how I can do better for myself first then do better for the people I care about? I was watching the end of the Sopranos (binged in blob state of course) and there’s a moment where Tony refers to being prone to depression and all his legacy is is to pass on his ‘wretched’ genes to his son who has been suffering the same way. It stuck with me in a way that hit home a little too hard as I know my daughter sees me struggle even though she’s so young and her father would struggle with depression as well but much more vocally. I want to give her happiness and not let mental illness rule her life like it so often does mine, but how can I do that if I can’t do well by myself first??

TLDR: Struggling more often with super low points of depression over the last year due to high stress and inability to motivate myself.

67,"My wife and I have been married for a few years. In that time, I have to come to realize that she is still connected by an umbilical cord to her parents.  She messages them every morning and every evening, and most mornings has a phone call with her mother.

Let me add my experience with my parents. They divorced when I was 7, and I grew up primarily with my mother. Even to this day, I do communicate with her more than 1-2 times per week, and I'm sure some of that has to do with being a male.

My in-laws and my wife are extremely close, she lived with them for awhile before she moved in with me. When we first started dating we would meet her parents weekly for dinner and this continued until the time we moved out of state. 

However I have felt that as time goes on, it just becomes more and more evident that I feel like I'm living with my in-laws, even though we are thousands of miles apart. We have a son, he is almost 4 now, and my MIL has nearly an obsession with him, and expects my wife to send photos every day of him, and needs constant video calls. 

I have expressed my frustration throughout the years to my wife, who empathizes but then nothing changes. Every once in awhile, she will suggest I talk to her parents.  But I dont see this as my place to do so, and dont even know what i would say or how I would being this up. I feel as though if she is in agreeable with me then she needs to speak woth them. 

I'm not sure if I am being unrealistic, stupid, or if women around our age (we are in our early 40s) have similar relationships with their parents. To me, this behaviour seems very co-dependent and unhealthy.

One small change that has come from my frustration is that most evenings she will set her phone down (we both do) which prevents the calls. On many occasions if the phone is on, her mom will either ""accidentally"" dial her or call with some frivolous concern or question that could have likely been dealt with at another time (like in the morning when the two communicate anyways).

If I am overreacting or in the wrong, I am willing to change (and of course have adapted to this situation already). But this type of relationship is killing my attraction for my wife, and is slowly killing the marriage too.

TLDR: wife is very attached to her parents and I want to know if this is normal behavior.",07Jul2020,1

The pain and angst that's hidden inside
The worries and troubles that torment away
Making each day a dark cloudy display
Forgive me if I am not acting myself
I'm trying hard but it's impossible to spell
Please don't turn your back or turn away
Maybe just ask me if I'm doing okay
Please be patient, I am doing my best
Being normal is difficult when you are getting no rest
Pills and therapy are prescribed by the doc
To make it easier for me to function and talk

76,"Ever since I transferred to University from Community College last fall, things have just been dark. My best friend is at another school and I wasn’t able to make any real friends last school year. 1st semester was especially rough. I spent about every night alone in my dorm room. Everyone in the suite I moved into was already in a close friend group, and they weren’t too welcoming of me. 

I tried my best to put myself out there and make connections with people, but it just didn’t go anywhere. Things started to get a little better when I made a musical I auditioned for, but I still felt so damn lonely, like I couldn’t really connect with anyone. I also got hit by a car that semester, which was surprisingly one of my better nights because someone I knew from the show I was in took me to ER so I wasn’t by myself all night. 

This was also the first time I’d ever been out on my own. I come from an extremely loving family and I’m very grateful for that, but as a result I’ve been incredibly sheltered my whole life, so learning to do things on my own for the first time was such a shock for me. I grew so much that semester in terms of being an independent adult but wow it hurt. Then Christmas break happened and it was wonderful. My family and I were at the beach the whole time and my best friend was with me pretty much every other day and it was so relaxing. The one really shitty day I had was when my best friend and his girlfriend both stayed the night at my house. I love both of them to death and am so happy for them, but it also made me a little jealous seeing them together. They’re so happy together, and I just want to be happy with someone like that so badly. 

When it was time to go back to school, things sucked, but I was better adjusted. I was beginning to meet some people, but I still spent the vast majority of my time alone. I still ate every meal alone, spent every night alone, and walked to every class alone. But not everything was completely awful. I took some really cool classes that I enjoyed a lot. I’ve always been into musical theatre, but at school I began studying classical voice and I loved it. I even got cast in two leads in next year’s opera, which I was ecstatic about. Then COVID happens and I’m right back home, the semester is just cut short, just as it was really getting interesting. And next semester is gonna be half-asses because of COVID, and then I have one semester left and then college is over. I can also probably count on opera being cancelled, which is a bummer. 

So much has happened and it feels really heavy and I have nobody to tell it to. Whenever I try to bring it up to my parents, they pretty much tell me to tough it up and not worry about it. I wish it was that simple. I just feel so overwhelmed right now and emotionally I feel like I’m spiraling. I’m so scared of dying alone. I’m scared I’m going to wake up tomorrow and my life is going to be over, I’m scared I’ll never do anything. I’m scared I’ll never date anyone again, and I feel like this lockdown bullshit is going to last forever. 

I think above all I’ve learned that I don’t do well with loneliness. I haven’t dated in 4 years and I miss intimacy. I feel extremely self-conscious about being a 21 year old virgin. At this point I’m half way convinced I’ll be alone forever, and I hate it. 

And I think what sucks the most about this is this isn’t who I am. The me I know is a happy person, a good fun and hopeful one. And that’s just not how I feel right now. Thank you so much to anyone who has read through this post, it honestly feels so good just to unpack this somewhere.",07Jul2020,1

But after a while i would have that feeling bit out of my control, I would be extremely happy then so numb I just try to get on with the day. Over. And over. Non stop.

I've noticed for a while now, how hard it is to make lasting connections but even connecting with my family whom I love dearly is hard. Looking at myself from an outside perspective, I tend to constantly walk on eggshells with everyone which was something trained in to me by my father ( which I rarely talk to or see) as he had quite a temper when we did live with him as kids. 

As an seemingly adult person, now have weird awkward habits of trying to be extremely quiet and rarely seen, I constantly feel like I'm in trouble for most things and I have been accused by people and even partners in the past of being sneaky untrustworthy but they never understood that it's just me trying to stay out of trouble, nothing malevolent. Apparently, I act shifty. There's a lot of internal conflict on a daily basis and it's insanely exhausting, I have been in therapy a few times now for mental health issues.

The thing that just really hurts is that I want my family to know and see that I love them but I feel like I'm failing at that. I'm very close to my youngest brother and he along with my mom are probably the only ones that I can really be louder and more carefree with and but my other siblings and I don't get to spend much time together, and when we do I'm usually an anxious wreck for various reasons. I'm not very good at communicating properly or at being super vulnerable. I try to be there for them but I'm not sure how. Some times I feel like I don't know how to be a person anymore.

So, I was just wondering if anyone had any suggestions or something that has worked for them to be good at improving their mental health in order to love others? Or, something that might seem more fitting? Please and thank you!!

I dont really remember really feeling emotionally fulfilled at all. Every thing I do is to distract me from this constant feeling of dread and scrutiny. My life has gone by me wasted and days blend with each other, inseparable from the last. I abandoned my friends because im a gutless idiot who listened to people who might of thought they had the best intentions for me,people i trusted. My love life is virtually nonexistent.

91,"So ever since primary school i get this sudden urge of hitting things and destroying things. That sudden urge makes me feel extra large and other things extra tiny. As if i can lift a bed with my pinky.
These ‘thoughts’ often occur at night, before bed. And when they occur, i am usually able to subdue them, though sometimes my fist goes uncontrollably hitting the mattress.
One time i couldnt control it and resulted in me hurting my fist and straining my muscles (I went lifting my bed and table for no reason)
Now that im older these thoughts still happen, though not so much. As a kid i thought these were normal for boys in puberty, but when i asked my friends about it they told me theyve never experienced anything like this.

I've tried being the listener and being there for him and tried to make him happy but nothing gives. 

We literally were just talking about how next week he wanted to go to the beach because he's bored and has had it here. So I agree to have us go next week so we can build up some cash and go. Today, while taking care of the kids, I was on my computer working, I can tell he was getting frustrated because our baby kept crying but I was almost done so wanted to finish up my work and then I can take over. Still I offered my help and he denied it since I was almost done. He seemed overwhelmed and again offered to take the baby and asked if he was okay, he said ""no, no he was not okay, that he wasn't happy"". I tried telling him to talk to me but he just stayed quiet. 
I went on to finish my work since he decided to stay silent. 
Wasn't mad but I'm not going to lie and say I wasn't a little annoyed. I want to help but sometimes he's makes it impossible.
Also, we've gone to the beach (in California, we're in Las Vegas) like a month ago already and with the whole Corona thing it makes me really nervous to go anywhere but I still agreed to go for the sake of his mental health, now he wants to go again but I can't help but feel I put not just myself or him at risk but also our kids which are under 4yrs of age. I feel like I'm purposely putting them at risk with all of this going on. 

I feel like I'm in between a hard place here 

Why do I feel like he's being selfish for wanting to take care of his mind at the risk of his kids health? It seems so wrong but I worry about my kids. We've literally all been coughing and sneezing and can't help but to think about Covid-19 right away. 

What do I do? I feel so helpless...I've asked him if there are things I can do to help him but the way he gets I see him as being so damn stubborn to the point that I just don't want to help him or deal with him. 

But then I feel guilty for not being there for him as I should.
I understand having mental health problems is nothing to joke around and is HUGE amd we gotta take things serious but what about the other person too? It becomes draining at times. All I hear from him are negatives things about almost everything. 

Please help me either understand more or what to do because he doesn't even know what to tell me and at this point I'm getting desperate because sometimes he won't talk to me and I end up getting impatient with him and can't help but to get mad.

We have been friends for a very long time and have always openly joked about and discussed suicide because we both deal with suicidal ideation. I am aware that this is fucked up and morbid, but it has been a source of coping for many years.

When I'm stressed I'm known to not respond to texts at all for days on end. It's almost like I feel overwhelmed by things that shouldn't be overwhelming at all. Texting someone feels like a LOT of effort even if I'm not carrying the conversation, and I almost get a sense of dread when I receive a text from a loved one, almost like I feel like I have/I'm gonna let them down so I don't even try to text back.

(some person info below:)

I've struggled with episodes of depression that have come and go throughout my life and a lot of the times it's totally debilitating. I'm young and have already lost so much of my life to it. I also am convinced I have ADHD/ADD or something of the sort and I was seeking help for trauma but couldn't even stay long enough to get a preliminary diagnosis because of COVID (we discussed PTSD or acute stress disorder but didn't come to a preliminary), so I'm not really a stranger to mental illness, and this one trait has basically stayed with me from the beginning of the struggle to the present.

It sort of accumulated in my chest like a second heart, and it feels like it collects there whenever I dismiss the thought. Then I feel that I got this ball of hate in me that just wont dissipate, like its mad at me for not acting on urges and is like “Aight, fuck you. Imma just build up here and cause you to feel vengeful at nothing in particular.”

Honestly fuck that thing, I can’t draw in peace without it crowding my thoughts with MAKE IT BLOODY, MUTILATE THEIR LIMBS, DEVOUR THEIR FLESH WITH YOUR TEETH and like god damn just leave me be.

123,"I don't have a single happy memory from when i was younger apart from a ""clip"" of me playing in the snow when i was 4 years old. every memory after that up until i was 8 years old is just filled with abuse and violence from my mother.

Things didn't improve much when i lived with my father, he frequently left me to fend for myself so he could either sell drugs or have sex with women. I practically raised myself until i was 11. At this point my mother coaxed me into returning to her and my little half-sister, under the guise that she had changed and was no longer an abusive person. Obviously that was a lie, and within 2 weeks of being back the abuse started. I was cooking and cleaning, getting my little sister ready for primary school. Hell the only thing she did was sleep on the couch.  I had my friends around a lot and in the end she accused them of molesting my little sister. I still believe to this day that she did that because she wanted to sleep from 4pm-6pm and the noise we made stopped that from happening.

Eventually my aunt got involved and told me to live with her and i did. Although once i lived with her it was great, holidays every year and just a nice household. About 2 years in my mother threw accusations that i tried to kill my sister and that i molested her. My entire family got involved and it turned out that my sisters father was a convicted pedophile and put a knife to my mothers throat back in the day. So it transcribed that she was just throwing the same experiences about to effectively bend the truth to whatever situation she could. My entire family black-sheeped her and she was literally forgotten about.

Now although no one believed her, my mental health has just been destroyed, my confidence with dealing with children has really messed up to the point where i feel like can't interact with them because in the back of my mind i think people think i'm a pedophile when i'm most definitely not. This has caused a rift between my godson and my little 2nd cousins which i regard as my nephews. Although i want to be stupid, silly and all loving but this mental wall is just stopping me from doing this. In fact, i find it very difficult to love anyone, it's like i lack the functionality feel that emotion at all.

My sister has tried to contact me on multiple occasions but since she still regularly speaks to my mother, even though shes been sectioned on more than one occasion, i don't trust her or what she has been manipulated to believe by my mother. My family have expressed concerns about her intentions and strongly believe i should not interact with her at all, although one day if i have children i would love her to be an auntie to them, so long as my mother is kept far away and even in the dark.

I think I've rambled on a lot and need to ask the question, can you ever mentally heal from a complete lack of love? has this forever messed me up and i'm never going to be happy or even be able to fully love another human being? People will say get help, but then i'll need a therapist and opening up about this to other people, in real life is scary. Another aspect its almost like i'm like my mother if i have server mental health issues and i never want to be like her.

I’ve been off medication for 3 months currently after 12 months on escalitopram and I’ve been seeing a counsellor through my university for 12 months, he wanted to refer me to a psych that deals with trauma in our area but covid happened and that didn’t end up happening. I’m unsure how to bring this up to my parents, they’re very much oblivious to the extent of my mental illness and I’m not sure how they’re going to react to me broaching this subject because my sister was admitted for a few days last year after a major incident and it was extremely stressful for my family.

127,"There is so much I could put on here for backstory and symptoms, but I'm going to try and pack as much info as possible in a short space. My best friend ( and myself for that matter) has always been slightly ""off"" or ""weird"". Since we were young kids we both have had problems articulating ourselves, explaining things, being understood in our thought process,etc. We've always been able to understand each other though, and at this point I think I'm a safe space for him for his (not trying to sound disrespectful) "" crazy"" to come out. A few years back his father and cousin both passed close in time to each other and he was very close with both. I believe this is when it started or at least when I started noticing a decline in mental health. ( Although in middle of ramblings he's said it was the mirror at Ms Karen's house when he was 14). Fast forward to 2018-2019, a father figure to us passes from scerosis ( his dad also did) and he finds out that his baby isn't his baby( he was only a few months when he found out but still. ) Since then it has just been.... Different, bad,sad, something. When it's just me and him he's usually at his worst, but it's effecting every facet of his life. His family is"" out to get him and want to see him in prison or a psych ward"", lost his job, he can control lightning, he almost always speaks in third person, assumes other persona's. I've figured out 3 or 4 names I feel he is almost always speaking to. Incoherent speech patterns, mumbling to himself,paranoia,etc. A few days back we talked for a while and it felt like a cry for help. The pain in his voice hurt so bad. Like the actual him broke through and said he didn't want to be like this and maybe after enough time they will just go away and he won't be so loud about it. It's really the only time he's eluded to him not being normal kind of. So all that for this question...... How do I convince him to start exploring his options for treatment without scaring him off. I feel like his last anchor and don't want to do the wrong thing and make stuff worse. This has been heavy on my heart for a while now and I need to do it. I'm just praying for some advice or input from someone that's been in a similar situation. What do I do, what do I not do? God bless anyone who actually read all this.

130,"My 7 year old has severe behavior problems which have become much worse under quarantine and nothing seems to be alleviating them now, even things that once worked. She has a psychiatrist and psychologist and I’m going to speak with a new psychologist today and her psychiatrist later today but 
I’m home with my toddler and I’m a wreck.
The 7 year old is heading to camp again today but her behaviors have been slowly coming out there (though nothing like at home though) and it’s starting to get uncomfortable for her. Other kids and staff are taking notice and I know it’s going in a bad direction but we can’t keep her home right now and there’s nowhere else to take her. At home, she is very destructive and physically aggressive and lately does disturbing things like cut ALL of her hair off in a fit of anger and then drew all over her face and hair with mascara that she found
. She is now almost completely bald. 
I think she has moved from just adhd and possibly ODD to a mood disorder. Maybe even a psychotic break. She is clearly very distressed right now and I’m practically hysterical that
I can’t get her immediate help short
Of going to the ER and maybe we need to go. I have considered it. I think we are at a point where she either needs medication to calm her so she can be at home or she needs a stay in inpatient care and I have read it’s hard to get inpatient care for a child also. My husband is in literal complete denial. He gets mad when I mention it and denies that she’s having a mental health crisis. He isn’t helping at all to find care for her. It’s lunacy and I’m barely functioning today.
I had to decide this morning if she was going to be staying home from camp because she’s clearly lost it or send her because her behavior is much,much better there and that will allow respite for our toddler from her sister’s behavior.
Any words of support would be so, so appreciated right now. I really don’t have anyone else to tell.

131,"The longest I’ve held down a relationship was 5 years and while I have had many relationships, both that I have broken up with and been broken up with I feel after my current now ex-Girlfriend broke up with me I’m ready to admit that....that I don’t think was meant to be loved......

I’ve always until back in 2015 felt like a monster because everyone, including family, made it very obvious that I wasn’t human.... and thus didn’t deserve to be treated like a normal person..... I just..... was a tool, a fixture, a resource, and a verbal punching bag....

Then in 2015 I realized that even characters in shows and games that are portrayed as monsters can be loved so...... where did that leave me?

Nothing..... I guess

And....... the guy I dated before my current ex-gf kinda broke me and I..... I was truly done with dating.... and then a year later she came into my life....

She was amazing, and I......... I felt so numb for so long and then one day I just..... starting truly feeling the love I had for her.... before I felt numb but I could still tell I loved her it just..... felt extremely distant...

And then, Monday, she.... she stopped saying “I love you” back out of nowhere... she stopped calling me Babe..... and with my history of relationships I.... I started to get severe anxiety (diagnosed with situational anxiety) so yesterday (Tuesday) I asked her what was wrong and.......... and the issues boil down to that she cares about me...... that I embody everything that she could ever want in a SO....... but she can’t imagine me with her when she imagines the future.......

And........ truly........ I have been in so many relationships where the person says that they don’t love me....... but they just......... want to stay in that relationship?..... I..... I am ugly, there is no way around it..... so when I started I... I felt actually loved for the first time and......

And I guess I just......... don’t know how to process my sadness... she just................ 

It feels that the world wants to make sure I knows i do not deserve to be loved in any way shape of form... when I’m a temp, when I’m a forced date, when I’m a crutch, when I’m a rebound, when I’m a literal joke, when I’m a expected fixture, and.... and when I even have the chance of being actually loved and cared for.... and I’m....

Whatever I am...... it’s not worth of anyone.... no matter the circumstances...... and my fear of living and dying alone is something I just need to accept....... I’m........ I’m not worthy of love and that’s okay....

Right after I quit my grandma got sick and I’m taking care of her everyday in the hospital back to back. Then she left us.

Then I was doing freelance work while looking for a job right before the pandemic hit, even looking for internships/ part time job. Anything but no luck at all. I went to several interviews and sent a lot of emails. 

When the pandemic hit, my freelance project went poof, I’ve got no any client at all. I’ve try to register on platform like fiverr ,workana, etc but I didn’t get any reply. Now that things are slowly shifting back to “normal” where businesses slowly open up again in my country I was hopeful, yet I still got no reply no matter how many job I applied. I just need a temporary job until I can pursue my degree this September as a mature student. 

I feel like I’m doing nothing. Like I’m waiting for time to pass. I feel guilty that my boyfriend is covering up our rent and my dad still occasionally send me money because he knew I’m not surviving. I can’t even get a job like as a waitress.

This bully's given name was the same as my preferred name. The first day of class, the teacher was reading out our names from the sheet to take attendance, and he said my given name. I politely asked him not to call me by that, and to avoid confusion with the bully, to call us by our last names or number us. He ignored my request, and said that he would just call me by my given name as it was written on the sheet. After this interaction, for reasons I do not understand, this bully would shout my given name from across the room, with no provocation, at any time when the teacher wasn't directly talking to the class. Every day. Of every week. Over. And over. And over. Again. I couldn't tell the teacher to make him stop, since his apathy was the inciting event.

167,"*Trigger Warning: Brief Mention of Different Trauma Types, Not Graphic- Merely Listed* 
This is long, be prepared to read.

I’ve had a near perfect life. That’s not to say that I haven’t lost, or struggled, or failed, but the bad things that I have experienced are, to me, the same things that are just the facts of life that many others also go through. I currently feel like there is a dissociative identity bandwagon right now. Maybe people are pretending or maybe they’re being misdiagnosed or maybe my perception of a bandwagon is simply incorrect. Regardless, I’ve never seeked counseling or therapy, but I’ve been legitimately experiencing depersonalization/derealization/disassociation—I’m honestly not sure what it’s called anymore—since childhood. Basically feeling like I’m dreaming, watching myself from above or other point of view, sometimes not recognizing my own reflection. I can’t remember the very first time I noticed it, but I remember being small and sitting in a classroom and all of a sudden everything would seem so surreal and “I felt like I was dreaming,” is how I described it to my mom at 7-8 years old. When I confided in her, she offered advice to me to “wake myself back up,” is how I think she put it. She seemed concerned, but mostly calm and casual which caused me to believe that what I was experiencing was normal and just happens from time to time to everyone. It was up until early adulthood when I think that it finally clicked with me that not everyone experiences this and in fact, not many. I believe that because of the normalization that I developed in regards to my “dream state,” that I was able to create and utilize my own coping mechanisms. It’s something I’ve learned to live with up until recently.

The reason I’m here is because for the past 9-12 months, it has been really intense and nearly unavoidable day in and day out. Except this time it feels different. Instead of feeling like I’m simply just dreaming or watching things from a third person view, I literally feel like my mind is stuck or lost in another time of my life. Lately it’s been first grade, 2000-2001. Other frequent time frames are 2004-2006 and occasionally 2010-2013. Nothing outside of normal life events happened in these time frames. Birth of siblings, a handful of family deaths (only one being significant to me-grandfather), graduating high school , etc things like that. I feel the need to to reiterate that nothing extraordinary has ever really happened to me because I know many or most people that experience what I experience or something similar have experienced trauma, assault, neglect, and things of that nature. I’m staring off into space even when doing tasks that should occupy my attention. My thoughts, words, everything I do feels completely disorganized. Which is strange because my life such as my bedroom, bathroom, clothes are very organized and I’ve always had strong attention to detail yet I can’t seem to get ahold of my own inner self. I just don’t understand why this is happening to me and why I cannot mentally escape my first grade classroom and why my mind keeps getting basically frozen in 2001. It goes beyond simple mental imagery as I actually FEEL like it is a different time, a different year, a different age. But I do not take on the persona of my first grade self or anything like that, I’m always able to acknowledge I’m the same person, but I quite literally feel like I’m trapped in a mental time travel and it also feels like I’m dreaming at the same time. Has anyone ever experienced this or know someone that has?",07Jul2020,1
168,"Wow! It turned out to be a long and lengthy rant! Please go through it and tell me how you interpret it. So please go through it, it will be highly appreciated and don't get deterred by the length. Thanks.

I had this account created some 6 months back but it stayed there, just like that. Idk what drove me to reddit these past few days, 6 days to be precise. Came across this sub the very first day and it intrigued me. Never thought that it's a possibility. I faced the horns of dilemma these past few days, drowning in memes and ghost stories, but this sub remained, never ready to say what I should have long ago. But now, I am here, at last.

What are abusive parents actually? I had gone through many a incidents of users facing abuse at the hands of their parents which I never thought possible for a parent. Those are only there for the movies, I thought. A broken child, growing up to be a person of its own. A true surviving story. But here I found many survivors. Am I one? After all movies are based on real lives.

Where do I begin! As far as my memory goes, my parents were very good and loving to me but I was mainly brought up by my grandma. There isn't much that I remember from that period. But I faintly remember an incident, I think it is from my 1st grade. It was the day of the parents teachers meeting along with the distribution of the report cards. I remember father had taken me to school and the teacher had spoken in lengths with him. He looked sombre once we left school school, not saying a word on the return journey but I was okay (didn't understand what results meant as such I guess). On return, I saw my father and mom getting together and speaking in hushed tones that somehow made me afraid, may be the vibes they were giving out. So remember running to my grandma. She stayed with us till her death. But going there later. So, I run into her arms afraid, almost at the verge of tears and ask her, what was wrong? She wouldn't say anything but smiled and gave me candies instead and told me while I was having them, now the thing removed from mind, that my report card was colourful! I didn't get it that time but was happy that it might be something good then. But soon, hell broke lose, as my father marched into her room and grabbing me by my arm, dragged me to my parent's room and locked the door! He then took off his belt and started hitting me with it. I don't remember the pain anymore, just remember grandma's face through the window, crying and asking him to stop. I have no memory of it from there and never asked anybody about it. Apparently I had failed my 1st grade, so my report card was marked with red.

I don't know what changed, but I became a good student from then on. Good in class and at home. Results improved, I mean I was getting almost full marks in every subject till I was in the 4th grade. Now coming to my parents, they were good all along this period! Remember occasional thrashing for my antiques, but it never bothered me that much. My father took interest in my studies and would task and test me from time to time. I never gave room for complaints.

But a thing that stood out, all through my school life, even in high school, was that it was my grandma who prepared my breakfast, my tiffin, getting me ready and everything while my parents slept. I had early morning school, starting from 7.15 in the morning. Till fourth grade my father used to drop me but then I used to take my bike and go. So when I left, it was just my grandma who would see me off. It still stayed with me and it doesn't sit well with me, idk why!

Growing up, I soon started going out on my own to the playground, parks to play with my friends after school, or be it basketball practice at school but everybody knew about the rule I had! My father returned from work (he was an engineer working for the government) at around 6-6.30 in the evening and I can't be out after that. So each day no matter where I was, I had to return home by 6. On the occasions (there were a few, growing in number as older I got) I wasn't home, I was not allowed in on return and has to wait outside the closed doors for sometimes hours (2 and half hour being the longest if I remember correctly) till someone, mostly my grandma forced my father to open the door.

Then I had the study routine, I had to sit down to study by 7 or else a round of either shouting or a few slaps here and there. And God save me if I dozed off studying! But nothing was a surprise as a cousin of mine used to get beaten up for getting 95 out of 100 cause someone got more than her ( her father is a gem, but I even feared her mother).

Time goes on and I go from class to class, year to year, more of less the same thing. But the thrashing or shouting reduced drastically again due to my grandma, who made my father understand that now I am grown up and shouldn't be treated so. Somehow it struck a chord with my father.

My mother all along was somewhat non existent, she too feared my father but he wasn't abusive towards any other person. Never drank, had no bad habits, but still he was this raging fireball towards me. My mother on the other hand never stopped him but would emotionally manipulate me, into doing what they thought best for me. (Now I come to think of it as emotional manipulation, god this subreddit helped me a lot). 

Hitting puberty is a time when there's need for guidance and being the only child had no one. I was sent to a boy's only school, a missionary one. So never came across girls much and it was discouraged even at home (though not directly). So naturally it made me nervous around girls. At this time I came across a girl in an extra class taken at our teachers house. She was beautiful and almost immediately I fell for her. But had no guts even to talk to her and moreover she was Muslim (a big no no in our family). So controlled my urges and thinking about everything, never approached her, not even a hi was exchanged! (She is a good friend of my now and I told her everything but it was too late, as she got married, but that's for another account! I even wrote a letter in blood, stupid teenager, huh!)

I did well in my 10th standard and decided to go ahead with science (my father wanted me to be an engineer, just like him!) and went ahead with it. But somehow I didn't find it interesting. I failed in a couple of subjects in the first term, but soon I put all my efforts in and recovered. But in my senior year I meet this girl and things changed!

I now had started growing a mind of my own (I know it was high time) so when I met this girl (from the neighborhood) I again fell head over heels for her but this time the only difference was, I approached her. Soon we became good friends, chatting over the new phone I got. She was a Muslim too, but this time something had changed in me and I dared. Friendship grew into something special but before it could go ahead anymore, somehow my father came to know about her! (I didn't tell my parents, or even my friends as I didn't want to end it prematurely. I wasn't prepared tbh) Anyways my father engaged me in a conversation about her. I played safe by neither accepting or denying, leaving it open to interpretation. That mad him even more mad but this time I got no thrashing but for a few days my existence was ignored! I was cool with that but what followed, I wasn't prepared for it.

I still remember quite vividly! It was a Sunday evening, winter had just set in and the air had lost its moisture but became chilly. I and my GF, were strolling around a park away from both our places ( she too hadn't told about me), when suddenly out of the blue, a car started honking just behind us. I turned to curse but only to find our car and father driving it. I was forced to get in, leaving her alone ( I won't forget that day, the look on her face, the last look I got of her) to get back home. 
I was taken back immediately and grinding began, this time both my parents! They accused her of being Muslim (as if it mattered) then going on to call her names, till being called a prostitute. I broke down at first then burst out, tearing my shirt as the buttons went flying in every direction, but at that moment a hard and tight slap rang across my face! It was my father, who hit me again after 4-5years! I couldn't take it anymore and left home. I went to the park but she was gone. Her phone has been switched off when I tried calling her. I got tensed!

For the night I went to my best friend's place and told him everything, about her to the events of that day. I asked him not tell my parents if they asked (they surely will visit, I knew). Nothing happened that day or the next. I had skipped school and contemplated my next moves. I tried calling her but again her phone was off! It frustrated me the whole day. I even thought of returning home and go to her place to sort out but I controlled that urge.

With nightfall came my father (my friend's parents had forced him into a betrayal, kid you not, it did feel like it then) and with him the news that my parents had visited my now ex-GF's house to talk her parents out of it so that their daughter doesn't meet me! Now I knew what the switched off phone meant! They knew I wouldn't budge, so they took the matter into their own hands. And everything was lost for me. 

My studies suffered, my mental health too took a toll (all this I am understanding now, at that time I was made to believe that these were side effects of puberty). I wasn't left alone, father started accompanying me to school and mother on the return. I somehow grew distant with my parents this time. 

Soon school life was over and I took tests to get into an Engineering College. (I wasn't sure then, but my parents wanted the legacy to go on). All these years my grandma was always there to support me, my only lifeline that kept me sane.

Now I got the opportunity to go away. It was back in 2006. I left my parents place and took an apartment in the city where my college was, some 150 miles from my parent's place. It was kind of a relief, I'll not lie! I started studying and enjoying my college life. Met, a girl in the 2nd year and everything was going well. But she opened me to art and performance art! I was always a movie buff but now I knew what I wanted to be and it wasn't an engineer! I would talk to my father on a daily basis almost ( understand, I didn't know anything how felt then) but somehow my father started changing. His change started soon after the GF fiasco. But still he was my father.

Now when everything is great my mother wanted to drop in and stay with me for a few months (apparently she missed me but I only missed my grandma, who blessed me when I left) and so she did but soon events take a turn for the sour as I was no longer the kid that left my home town, but somewhat of an independent thinker. Soon we started to clash and it was my turn to burst out but each time I did, she would break into tears, feigning a stroke (sometimes when things went out of hand) and we both lost mental peace. It went on like this for over an year ( she must have thought with time I would again change, but this time they were in for a surprise) but I didn't budge (I had broken up with this girl friend again because mom didn't like her and I don't know how it crept in to our relation, driving us apart) it was her this time she had to leave. And she left and never asked to return, thank god! 

By now I had stopped going to college and started studying about films and filmmaking on my own. And one day out of the blue I dropped out of engineering, pursue a career in film making. Surprisingly my father didn't say much but left it to me to decide, just stating the pros and cons. But for my mother now all hell broke loose. She tried every trick in her bag to get me back to engineering but this time I didn't budge. I sought out filmmakers and started assisting them, first as intern then gradually moving up the ranks. It was in 2010.

My father now seems more approachable than my mother, as she continues to discourage, even till today, using her emotional tactics. Father now gets pissed at her for this attitude but she still does. I would visit them on a bi-monthly visit, mainly to see my grandma, who was happy for me.

In 2017 my grandma died and every attachment I had to the place died with her. Never gone back since and never saw my mother too. But we sometimes talk on the phone. I meet my father every month and he is a totally different person now. But my mother still keeps nagging, the new one being, to get married! Which I will not in the near future.

I will be 33 this July 16th and now have a stable girlfriend of 7 years+, have a few movies behind me, mainly writing and assisting. My own documentaries, ads, short films and an IMDB page with 15 credits to my name.

Idk if I was raised by abusers, still now not able to judge them, so those who went through my lengthy piece be the judge and tell me. What happened to me?

169,"I’ve been seeing a counsellor/therapist for about 10 years now off and on, mostly off over the past year. 
When I first started, I was a drunk, depressed and miserable idiot who figured I was just broken and wouldn’t be fixed. Drinking and my attitude were a huge factor in my wife leaving with my son, I was getting in trouble at work life was general hell. 

This month: I not only got injured which busted/aggravated a knee injury but also found out I’ve got a long time chest injury that needs to get fixed ASAP. So my exercising has taken a back, causing me to gain 12 pounds. My partner went through a very difficult week which included self harming that I had to help her through. I was put in a very uncomfortable situation at work which I shouldn’t have been put in and which caused me a lot of stress and sadness.  And on top of that and easily the worst, my son’s 8 month old puppy passed away after he was in bed last night. Something went wrong during her surgery. 

I’m doing alright, although absolutely crushed for my son. He loved that dog and spent most of his time playing with her. It was really easy today to let everything pile up in my head and just shut down, but through practice and a very loving girlfriend I was able to sort everything I needed to mentally and not let them get jumbled into one big mess of my life sucks. To the point where I feel like I’m actually handling all of this better than most people would, and that’s a really good feeling to have that I wanted to share. 

Keep working on yourself. You’re not too far gone. I just had the most challenging month I can remember having in a long time and I’m dealing with it in a healthy way while still letting myself be sad. If I can get here, anyone can. Just please don’t give up and let yourself make mistakes. Failing is only failing if you stop trying.",07Jul2020,1
170,"Hi everyone!

I'm over 25, suffering from agoraphobia and, things leading to another, living with my parents with no job. I'm not making much progress because I fear pain and basically have no motivation to do anything causing me pain. Finding love recently has pushed me to see a hypnotherapist and I've made baby improvements, but I unfortunately have bad reflexes of sadness, self-loathing and basically doing nothing when I'm feeling bad.

However, my parents are worried and upset and recently decided to enforce rules for me for my own good (like waking up at a certain time, doing chores, etc.)

Unfortunately, this resulted in me feeling really disappointed and angry at them. I said that I expected them to be kind and helpful instead of punishing, but they simply answered that being kind did nothing and that they're not punishing but helping. According to online ressources, taking your child's things away and giving them consequences when they act in a way you disapprove is legit education, but as someone in a child position, I find it hard to swallow, haha. I am of course aware that it is their home and that I have to submit, but I feel that trust has been broken between us.

This has at least motivated me to try and find a job (so that I can leave lol), and some of my friends are ready to motivate and help me in a positive way. I will start CBT very soon to see if the therapist can help me get any motivation.

Does anyone have tips to motivate me to work on my phobia and on my life in general? Is there an alternative I can suggest to my parents instead of them ""helping"" with childish rules? (Or am I an entitled brat for imagining my parents owe me anything?)

172,"Okay so sometimes I hum out of the blue I just can’t stop humming at all it especially happens at night. I don’t know how to stop humming sometimes my voice will stop in the middle of it because it’s so tired of continuously humming, but that’s only for a split second then it goes back to it, I tell myself in my head that I want to stop and that I have to. I have to stop humming because I have a little sister who has autism and she gets upset about my humming (just mine, if my friend hums it’s fine, or if anyone else hums it’s fine, it’s just me) to the point we’re she will cry. One of the times that it got really bad my dad grabbed me by the wrists as tight as he could and kept on asking what was wrong (not in the nice or sincere way he was yelling it, and my wrists hurt like hell) I finally got away by kicking him, and ran into the bathroom and locked the door, he took my phone so I couldn’t contact anyone for help (I was still humming during this whole thing btw) I tried to close the door but I couldn’t, he yelled at me saying “LOOK AT WHAT YOU’RE DOING TO YOUR SISTER!” I couldn’t actually go over and look because he was pinning me behind a door, he eventually let me out from behind the door and picked me up and yelled “NOW IM ANGRY” and walked to my room (I sleep in a room that wasn’t designed to be a room, the literal door is a curtain) and threw me on the ground (I sleep on a futon btw, a futon on the floor) and he went to my sister’s room, so I tried running away by running over to this apartment close to mine, they are a couple and they have kids, I thought that they would help me, but they didn’t answer the door so I snuck back home, he didn’t even notice it, I eventually stopped humming and got my phone back, and texted my best friends about it, once of them ever since it happened has been staying the night with me when I’m at my dad’s ever since. It happened again last night (only it wasn’t violent) and now I can’t go to her house, or have her come here for a while. Last night he yelled saying “(deadname) IS TORTURING YOU FOR (I’m just going to replace it with my pronouns: their) SELFISH NEEDS” and while I was trying to get these papers away from them (because it felt like a breach of privacy) and they ran around with the papers taunting me. I was still humming at the time and they kept on yelling at me for it. I just can’t wait until I’m eighteen and can move out of this hell hole.

176,"Hello,

I’m here because I have a very old friend of my family (92 years old) who is suffering severe untreated depression.

Her symptoms are typical of depression in the elderly:

Insomnia

Increased pain and fatigue associated with her regular illnesses like arthritis 

Hopelessness 

Loss of self worth 

Loss of enjoyment in normal things 

Increased perseveration over her mortality 

Withdrawal from communication 

She recently had her beloved cat die and had to move into a small elder apartment (not assisted living)

She has had depressive episodes in the past but none quite like these past few months.

My family is going to call the council on aging in our town about getting her some geriatric psychological support and occupational therapy.

However, she is resistant to treatment and she struggles to understand what is happening to her. 

I have tried to explain to her a few times that while some of this is caused by sad things in her life it is also a chemical imbalance in her brain and it is NOT HER FAULT that she can’t cheer up and receiving medication and counseling would NOT mean she is crazy.

I think this is very hard for her to wrap her head around because of the time she grew up in and her declining mental clarity. 

Unfortunately my grandmother who is younger than her and lives with her also does not understand depression and is chronically impatient with her and while she does her best to help it usually amounts to her saying something like “pull yourself together and come out with me. You have so much to be grateful for compared to some people.” Which I’m sure doesn’t help.

They are both chronically stressed by this situation.

We will hopefully get some good advice from elder services but it has been hard to get appointments with pandemic restrictions and I wondering if anyone here has experience with this 

Or if there’s anyone on here who is older and grew up in a time when this kind of problem was heavily stigmatized who had someone explain it to them in a way that finally made it click for them?",07Jul2020,1

So I, (20M) am a 40+ time survivor of rape. I finally started dating about 8 months ago and have dated a fair share of women and was in a relationship with one. I’ve had sex one time with one of them (not the relationship one). I’ve learnt that because of my past, I get very attached very fast and having sex makes me even more attached. Well, the girl I slept with cut it off which caused over a month of pain. Because of this, I made a rule for myself that I will not sleep with anyone outside of a relationship. I am a craver of commitment. I do not and will not do casual stuff. The only time I’ve had casual sex was because I was high on several things. Commitment is very very important to me (because of my past’s affects on my worldview and personality) even though I am a man. I am very masculine looking btw. Without commitment, sex is meaningless and I do not enjoy it. It takes a harsh toll on my mental health because of the attachment. Is it ok for me to have this rule? I fear that this will make me even more undesirable and will cause a great inconvenience to the woman Or cause them to drop me.",07Jul2020,1

180,"I have grown up as the only child in a toxic household. My dad is an alcoholic, and my mother didn't really do anything about it, and generally just disregarded the seriousness of the issue. But overall is a good mother.

My dad drank every night, more or less, with 3/4 nights going out to drink. From the ages of 11-16 I would stay up late to make sure when he came home there was no arguing. My school work suffered, I never had enough sleep, and this is where my anxiety stems from.There were nights where my parents would argue, he was never physically abuse but has broken items in the house. Definitley emotionally abusive. I don't know if I am ready to write about specific events. 

By the age of 14 I could not eat the days I knew he was going out, I would throw up if I heard them raise their voices, and I strarted self harming. I have had this anxiety feeling since, I went to the doctors around this time and was told ""it would pass"". I felt sick every single morning, physically sick say 30% of mornings. School didn't take it seriously. My friends didn't take it seriously. My mother only half took it seriously. I had to have my own room for my GCSE exams, my invigilator opened a can on coke and the sound it made just made me panic, mid exam. 

My dad bought his own house around the time I was 16 and started to stay there if he went out, which wasn't as often as before. Whilst I would still worry, I knew I don't have to stay up to make sure he comes in and doesn't argue. This was also the age I began drinking with friends, and had fun for the most part.

I moved out at 19 for university and loved having my own safe space, and enjoyed drinking at the start. I started taking antidepressants before my second year of university. I now have a month left at my student house before I have to move back with my parents, and have finished university.

For the past year I have found I can't handle alcohol, I will drink some, but I can't enjoy myself like I used to, and I feel this has been a long time coming. I have drunk less and less on nights out and try to leave early, or if I can not go out at all. 

I have been worried about my parents since the beginning of lockdown, if my dad would drink, would they argue? Would I be able to go and resolve it? Would I finally resort to calling the police? What would the aftermath of that be like? 

And now last night my housemate had two friends down, so them three and me and my boyfriend joined in. They played drinking games and I drank when I found it physically hard to. I was worried about being a miserable person in general and ruining the fun but I really did try. It got too much in the end and they were shouting and creating a lot of banging. One banged on the door as I was in the toilet and it just brought back memories and I broke down. I just don't want to see alcohol anymore.

181,"It's like since my teenage years I feel that there is something intrinsically rotten, guilty, disgusting, wrong, hidden inside of me. 

I tried telling everyone my whole life in details and all of my interests and hobbies and quirks... as embarrassing this oversharing is, no one ever found anything shameful or wrong about me, something that can make me point the finger and says ""ah, it's because of this"".

The major problem is that I had made mistakes and still do in hope to be Certified Good (TM). Forcing myself to convert and be religious, forcing myself to care for an abuser, denying myself all sorts of pleasures from food to relax to sex, attempting to be whatever successful incarnation of a good person I think I can be: career, social status, things that mean nothing but will ""clear me"" and ""prove it"" that I am a Goodie... I keep making my life miserable because of this. Everything is because of this. 

People says I'm too concerned with what everyone thinks of me, but that's not it: I am concerned about having my rotten core exposed, I want other people to approve and think ""good"" so they don't see it. If everyone says I'm good maybe it's proof I'm not so unspeakably bad. Unspeakably.

OCD has a higher prevalence among Muslim populations possibly because of the greater focus placed on the control of internal experiences if I understand correctly.

But from what I understand but the general consensus seems to be two fold: ""Pray it away"", ""Intense, focus on prayers despite the internal experiences (thoughts, images, urges, feelings, sensations, awareness and so on) being there (basically a form of focused mindfulness). 

I have not found anyone who suggests ERP techniques like paradoxical intentions. And ERP is the gold standard based on research. 

I have read a few articles here and there and I am not an expert on the subject so ofcourse I could be wrong. 

So my question is: Does anyone else feel like that this different religious take is actually harming patients and is therefore irresponsible?",07Jul2020,1

So I, (20M) am a 40+ time survivor of rape. I finally started dating about 8 months ago and have dated a fair share of women and was in a relationship with one. I’ve had sex one time with one of them (not the relationship one). I’ve learnt that because of my past, I get very attached very fast and having sex makes me even more attached. Well, the girl I slept with cut it off which caused over a month of pain. Because of this, I made a rule for myself that I will not sleep with anyone outside of a relationship. I am a craver of commitment. I do not and will not do casual stuff. The only time I’ve had casual sex was because I was high on several things. Commitment is very very important to me (because of my past’s affects on my worldview and personality) even though I am a man. I am very masculine looking btw. Without commitment, sex is meaningless and I do not enjoy it. It takes a harsh toll on my mental health because of the attachment. Is it ok for me to have this rule? I fear that this will make me even more undesirable and will cause a great inconvenience to the woman Or cause them to drop me.",07Jul2020,1
189,"i haven't self harmed in 2 years i think. my left arm is the part of my body that is most scared still. 
the thing is that lately (past few weeks) i've been having the urge to self harm again. i can't identify any triggers, and also don't have the courage to tell my therapist.
i've always been a very closed off person when it comes to how i'm feeling and the things that are hard for me to deal with. i usually wait for the hard time to pass and then discuss it in therapy. i know it's not the most effective way to treat it but it's just the best way i can. 
i don't know how to stop feeling this way. i'm afraid i will start self harming in alternative ways such as smoking a lot, or distancing from my parents. both ways i think it is worse than actually cutting myself. 
what is really stopping me from doing it is that right now i really don't want any fresh scars. maybe in a few weeks i will feel different about it.",07Jul2020,1

I've struggled with a porn problem my entire adult life, but I only realized how problematic it is in the last 2-ish years. I guess the DSM doesn't consider porn consumption an ""addicting"" behavior, but for lack of a better word my relationship with porn is best described as such. Sometimes it feels like a hopeless situation, but I know I have to challenge these thoughts because it's not hopeless. I had a 3 month stretch of almost no consumption, and it was the happiest I've ever been. I want to do even better, but thus far I've failed to replicate that experience.

Nonethless it raises legitimate questions. If porn cannot be the subject of an addiction what treatment options do I have? I've been doing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for a while and frankly I don't think it's going anywhere. I mean how much longer must I stagnate before trying something new? I just don't know where else to go. I'm already undergoing psychiatric treatment and therapy for depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I feel like something is missing. For a while I thought transcranial magnetic stimulation might address my depression and maybe give me a leg up in addressing my porn consumption, but I don't think that's an option. I need to solve this problem right now. I'm so sick of this. There has to be a more effective strategy. Is there like an AA for people with porn habits? Any info would be helpful.",07Jul2020,1

They all resolved themselves (husband got a better job and daughter is with the most amazing young man). I know things tend to usually get better when given time but I tend to feel like I’m in a hole and can’t get out. I’m always waiting for something bad to happen instead of being happy in the moment. I cry constantly and my kids end up comforting me which I hate because I want to be the rock for them. Lately, COVID is my main concern. Will we ever get to live a normal life? Will my kids ever get a world back where they can raise children in a safe and fun environment? Also, my best friend of 40 yrs is moving across the country and visiting will be hard due to lots of reasons. Just found out I have to tear up my basement due to plumbing issues.

Here is what my couples therapist sent as we were terminating our sessions:

“I don’t thing you’re a bad person.  I think you struggle with either being too empathetic towards others or not having any empathy at all.  There is no in between.  You also struggle with taking everything as a personal attack (classic BPD trait) and don’t possess the tools needed to be able to process through it.”

Anyone any insight on what I could do to try and get better with these things? Is this empathy thing common? It’s really scaring me, I don’t want to be a bad person. Is it all related to BPD

There are mornings where my depression is so bad i simply don’t have the energy to talk amongst most things. we made plans to go running in the morning the night before. This morning I woke up feeling completely empty (great another episode) heard my sister getting ready and getting dressed (even jingling keys) she’s a Virgo so she’s always very prompt and clean and organized and etc if you know what I mean. I’m a sad Capricorn artist who just got out of a 6 year relationship. Anyways. I’m in the kitchen getting my water bottle and her daughter (whom I love and adore) was just slamming me with their normal toddler questions. I simply could not answer her. I simply couldn’t find the energy to be the “cool” uncle I usually am. I literally retreated to the dark bathroom and talking out loud I said to the likes of “i really can’t talk right now I just woke up I’m in the zone” it wasn’t anything bad I didn’t have an attitude while saying it. But my niece was following me and my sister reallly took offensive to this action of mine. She grabbed her kid and said let’s go. She went to her room and didn’t come out for a while. So I was like are we still running? I thought my sister was saving me from the toddler grilling me with questions like Paparazzi to an heiress leaving a club at 3am. So I poked my head in and said “are we still running?” She said “I am
So angry right now, this is my kid and you do not talk to her like that! She is a toddler!” She started crying and was very emotionally involved in this. I explained that me walking away and not vomiting rainbows and butterflies to her child was nothing against the child I needed to go away. I love this kid to death and I do everything for her. I literally was just having a mental day but still wanted to go running. All I was, was silent and my sister was so pissed off at that.

About a year ago, I noticed I didn't enjoy videogames as much as I used to. I was a little bummed out since its most of what I did, but I thought it would go back to normal soon. It didn't and I started doing other things, archery, video editing, skating, VR, anything else. Those were fun for about two weeks before they got stale. In total, I probably spent about $700 and I feel guilty for ""wasting"" that much. I tried video games again and started enjoying Terraria, but since it was the most fun I've had in a while, I burned myself out (100 hours in 5 days) and get instant boredom from just the title screen. Nowadays, I spend my time listening to music, watching YouTube, browsing reddit, and sleeping.

In school, I've been doing ok, Average B's and C's with a D in Math and Science. Before, I'd have A's and B's in all subjects with a dream of being a chemist. Now I have no aspiration or long term goal. I have friends and acquaintances but I don't have anyone to really talk to about this kind of thing. That might be because of social anxiety though.

I haven't told my parents about my problems because they've told me before that everything will be fine and its just because I'm a teenager, so they feel next to useless in that area. And I believed them, but now I feel stupid for wanting to reach out because I keep telling myself ill waste the therapist's time.

214,"A rather long-winded post so please bear with me. 

My younger sister is in her early thirties. For years we the family have labored under the assumption that she has a diagnosis of both ADD and OCD. She began seeing a psychiatrist when we were in middle school for aforementioned diagnoses. However, we can't help but feel like more is amiss. Prior to that, she was an out-going, gregarious child. I was the quiet, sullen one. As we hit puberty however, we began to slowly swap roles. When she hit college, she moved in with an aunt the next city over to attend the school there. She seemed to be doing fine or so we thought. After staying there for a few years however, she was suddenly kicked out by our aunt and forced to move back in with our father. The reasons for this unceremonious  departure were not immediately revealed to us until some years later when we discovered that not only had she been failing her classes, but she  behaved slovenly and rarely picked up after herself while living there. 

Why did it take so long for this information to reach us? A majority of it is the simple fact that my sister hardly communicates. With anyone. At all. About anything. She next to never volunteers information about herself and any questions posed to her are met with very clipped, abbreviated answers. Occasionally, she'll even become defensive. Which leads me to the next issue: she rarely displays any overt emotion. I don't think I realized the extent of this until our grandma who raised us with our father and was the one constant mother figure in our lives passed away some years back. At the time, I was consumed by grief and so didn't give it much thought, but looking back, my sister did not display one iota of distress when our grandma passed. No crying, no nothing. Everyone in the family says the same thing. They never saw it. Instead, she projected the same facial expression that's come to be her trademark: a wistful countenance with this odd little smile. I haven't seen her really angry or really happy since we were kids. The most you can expect to get is exasperation/slight annoyance or little chuckles. That's pretty much it. 

That's not to say she's a heartless person. She routinely visits our bio mother who was diagnosed with Schizophrenia when my sister was two. This woman was only sporadically in our lives as small kids and I made the decision around the age of 10 not to communicate with her anymore because of her bizarre and chaotic lifestyle. My sister continued to communicate with her here and there via phone mostly for a number of years until just recently, she started seeing her in person frequently and going out to places in public with her. Sometimes I think she has more empathy than I do. But then one day, she disclosed to a family member that the reason she (my sister) thinks she has all these problems is because our bio mom placed her in a microwave as a baby. Bear in mind, there is zero evidence to support this and I won't even go into the logistics of how this is not possible, but just the fact that she entertains these types of notions from her bio mother is disconcerting. 

She has also been attending community college for over ten years. She claims the reason is because she's changed her major a couple of times. However, she swears that she has enough credits to get an Associates. No matter how many times we've told her to just grab it and use it to be more competitive in the job market she won't. Which has led us to believe that the credits she's accumulated is another lie. That's the other thing: we started discovering just how much she lies in the past couple of years usually to cover up things like lost jobs of which there have been many. She's been fired for everything from perceived indifference, to performance, to attendance. I think the maximum amount of time she's stayed anywhere was a little over a year. The average is about 90 days. She recently was fired from Amazon for failing to clock in and out one too many times. Or so she says. We can't be 100% sure because again, she pretended to keep going to the job a week after she lost it. Even after our father received a severance email because she had initially used his to apply for whatever reason. 

Perhaps most alarmingly, she's been in a five car accidents in the past five years all of which she's been at fault in. Most are rear-ends. The last one she turned in front of someone causing them to clip her back end. She attempted to cover this up for a period of time by parking far away from the apartment where she and my father live, but he eventually caught on.

We just don't know what to think. While we do feel like something is definitely wrong with her mentally, another part of us can't help but feel like maybe she's taking advantage of the situation with my father. In some ways, I think he also unknowingly enables her because he largely avoids confronting her about her many issues. He'll have a serious conversation with her initially, she'll ""yes"" him, and then it's seemingly brushed under the rug by both of them, not to be brought up until the next calamity. Nothing is accomplished. And it's tough because he is pushing 70 and does have some health issues. At one point, when he sold his house a couple of years ago, he finally attempted to exercise some tough love and told her she could not come with him when he downsized to an apartment. Predictably she waited until the last moment, solicited almost everyone in the family for a place to go, was let in for two months by the aunt, and then kicked out again for pretty much the same reasons. The general consensus seems to be that our father should be the one dealing with her and sad as it is, he wouldn't be in this situation if he hadn't ignored it for so long. I think he's also in denial and no doubt scarred to an extent by our mother's diagnosis. 

One thing worth mentioning is how contradictory my sister's behavior is in part. She regularly indulges in bars (before COVID obviously) and does associate with a certain circle of people. So she's not completely anti-social. We find it odd that she won't miss opportunities to attend parties, but when it comes to cleaning and taking general responsibility for other areas of her life, she predictably falls short. She'll spend what little money she typically has on frivolous things like alcohol, hookah, and hobbies and won't give my father any money for rent despite him asking countless times. She reminds me of me at age 16. 

It's gotten to the point where our father is now telling her she may have to lose her license and go into a group home because he now wants to move in with myself and my husband 300 miles away. You would think that a truly lucid person would seethe at the idea of essentially being committed, but she shows really zero response or concern. We're honestly thinking she may have borderline Schizophrenia that's gone undiagnosed, but so far the doctors she sees only prescribe her things like Fluoxetine and Buspar. 

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.",07Jul2020,1
215,"I guess I just need to vent to somebody. At the end of March, me and my ex were put under an immense amount of stress while her mom had a psychotic break. At the same time, her grandpa was dying. Her mom caused us to lose the pretty good living situation we had and also caused us to break up(6 years). I was struggling with a drug problem and was very distant. I immediately got sober but I had to move back in with my parents and she moved in with a ""friend"".  

The heartbreak and being sober for the first time in years was unbearable. I've never felt anything like it. I decided I needed a vacation so I took some time off work and went out west. Before i left, I smashed my laptop and found out my ex was with somebody else. Things were bad but i was able to manage. Long story short, after a week and a half out west, things got crazy and one split decision later, I'm turning myself in to the police. I can't say too much but I have two felonies pending against me with my face all over the news in two states. I spent a another week and a half locked up but my ex worked tirelessly to help bond me out. 

Because of the news coverage, I lost my job and had all sorts of terrible things said about me. I may have a chance at getting let off somewhat easy but the DA is definitely trying to make an example out of me. I've learned a lot since me and my ex initially broke up. I'm no longer the person I was but im filled with so much guilt and embrassment. Ive been put on meds and will štart counseling soon but ive partially relapsed because of the intense anxiety. Me and my ex have talked a lot and she said she still loves me very much and if we are meant to be together, things will work out.

217,"Not being ""the best"" is so triggering to me. Trying to impress people constantly drives me insane. Life feels like a stage play, where locking down alone in your apartment is the only way to relax. That's why I've never had any close friens or romantic relationships - I just can't relax around people. Average feels like a failure. This wouldn't be much of a problem, if I was some kind of a genius. But I'm not. And it makes me inexplicably ashamed. Shame is what I feel 90% of the time. I wish I could drive this energy into being a workaholic. But that's not the case either. I can't work properly. The sheer thought of work makes my heart beat faster and my palms sweaty. There're so many things I can get called out for, so many things that can make me look stupid - it's easier to just not do anything at all. Sometimes I think about just offing myself. Can you imagine how much easier it would be? No one puts high expectations on a dead person. I understand how rotten my thoughts and desires are, and I'm deeply ashamed of myself. But I just can't help it. The only time I feel truly happy is when I'm drunk. Like, really drunk, can't reach my bed type of drunk. I would just drop my body on the floor near the entrance, look at the giant mirror on the side wall, browse my reflection and think: ""I'm alive and healthy. Is there really anything more I could wish for?"", - and then I'd just pass out. I always hope this mentality sticks, but it always goes away the next morning.

A punch in the stomach at the realisation that my family are there for me but they don't understand my pain. My boyfriend does to an extent but I can't keep calling him so upset and then ruining his mood and his day and not to mention that he now feels he can't share his hurt with me.

Even when I speak to people there's nothing they can do is there. Let's be real, this is all in my own head and I don't know why it's took so long to realise but omg I have to deal with this all by myself. Noone else can make the anxiety go away, no matter how many nice things they say or how calm they try and make me.

Noone can put my life back together for me and it sucks. It sucks that I'm battling this horrible illness, or these illnesses and appart from the times of happiness with others, when I'm in pain then it's all down to me.

This makes me so angry at my mind, at my life and at everything in general to be honest. It's not fair. I didn't do anything wrong.

220,"Lately I’ve been thinking about blood on the walls and floors and some times white butterflies but mostly blood idk if it suicidal thoughts also been self harming and having mood swings but not extreme ones, I just wanna know what’s wrong with me I’m scared.",07Jul2020,1
221,"tw // mention of s*icide and s*lf h*rm

A while ago, my doctor suggested I may have agoraphobia and he put me on zoloft. The first few weeks were great, it felt like I was finally getting better. It didn't work as well for a little bit after that, and so I asked for my mom to call in and up the dosage. It helped a little, and it eventually stopped doing anything. My doctor said I should go to therapy but it never happened. 

A few months after that initial doctor's appointment, me and my mom were fighting and she ended up calling me crazy because she 'needed to take me to the doctors for being too nervous'. And after that, I just stopped trying to reach out for help. I always think about it. And maybe she didn't mean it, maybe she said it in the heat of the moment, but it hurt me a lot. It made me feel horrible, especially with all I went through to try and get help in the first place.

My anxiety has been getting worse, I can't talk to people I'm not close to without feeling like the wind is getting knocked out of me. My presentation anxiety used to be bad, but it's gotten even worse. I can't speak in front of a group without nearly crying or having a whole panic attack. And even when it's not in front of a group, when I talk about my feelings aloud, even for a small portion of the conversation, I'll just burst out into tears and I have no idea what the hell is going on. I could feel fine in the moment but appear to be 'In a mood' and if one of my parents asks if I'm okay, I just feel like I'm going to start sobbing in front of them.

I've been having trouble taking my medicine anymore, and I've been self harming. Usually it's only a couple of times every few weeks when everything bubbles over and I want to hurt myself, but it gets even worse on my period. I'll stay in bed and hardly take care of myself and I'll just lay here and feel horrible and think about what it would be like if I could off myself. I've never made plans, but whenever I get too stressed out, I always find myself looking up painless ways to go, just incase I can't take it anymore.

It feels like everything is just a mess, and I don't know what to do. My sister used to have extreme mental health problems, but she never told our parents, and I feel like if I try to keep getting help, it'd just be really unfair. She deserved help too but she didn't get it when she needed it most and that makes me feel so fucking horrible.

I don't know what else to say honestly. If you're reading this, thank you. and I hope you have a nice rest of your day",07Jul2020,1
222,Does anybody else get this? When I talk to a friend about something that’s bothering me. I notice I feel worse as it continues but the sadness is generated by myself. I usually notice this and try the steer the conversation in a way so they know what i need/want to hear but it feels forced at that point so I say I’m fine. Then I feel guilty for feeling worse just because they didn’t say what i wanted to hear. I don’t want to tell them what I want to hear because I feel like that gets rid of any sincerity and would be ignorant of me.,07Jul2020,1
223,"I started therapy in the expectation I'd realized that actually things were not what it thought, that the hole was not that deep and I could get out of depression by resignifying life. 

I was wrong. All the conclusions we came to are affirmations of the problems I have, and most of them have no solution. I'll be carrying this for life.

Therapy put me closer to suicide as I've never been. It's a constant, daily search for the chance of effectively stopping the suffering I find myself in.

Therapist is a good man, but he can't solve my problems, neither can I. 

In the last months I dig another hole, getting hard into drugs and exiting a comedown with another one. Tbh staying sober is not something I really want anymore.

I feel alone as fuck and I'm always surrounded by people. Feel like trash as I get compliments and I'm recognized among friends. I live the life people (and myself) dream, but simply can't enjoy it.

It's not about them, but me, and this is overwhelmingly annoying.

228,"So this may be long and drawn out, but it is simply because I don't actually know what is wrong with me or if anything is wrong at all, I'm going to be 100% honest and transparent and welcome any input whatsoever. 

\- I have a **stutter/ stammer** and have done since as long as I can remember. It's not severe but I feel it hold me back massively in all avenues of my life (Socially, dating, professional). Recently I've developed massive **anxiety** because of it; I overthink simple social gatherings with friends I've known for a long time, I am absolutely petrified of going on dates with girls and struggle with things that could possibly get me further in life.

\- I can't **concentrate** on things for a long time unless it's Netflix, Youtube, Instagram etc. I try to limit how much time I spend on these platforms as It's in the consciousness of society now that consuming too much of these things is obviously bad for you. But I used to be so ambitious and determined to put in the work that would make my life better but I find myself just wasting time and procrastinating on things so much.

\- My **discipline** has dwindled. This may link in to the previous paragraph but I've noticed I just have no discipline anymore. I never go to bed on time as my free time is very limited but it bites me in the ass the next day as I'm exhausted and work 12 hour days at work. I never sit down and do anything productive anymore as I find it mind-numbingly boring.

\- I've recently feel like I have had an **existential crisis.** My 27th birthday is 3 weeks away and I'm petrified of it as I work a mediocre job that is going no where even though I have so many things I want to do and accomplish in my life but I feel I am held back by the above. I don't know what my purpose is anymore. I used to want to be rich and constantly thought about it all the time but now I feel like it's an impossible thing to achieve with such a low rate of success and, again, the above holds me back somewhat.

\- This may not be relevant or could be extremely relevant but I also **drink and take drugs**. I feel it's necessary to mention this for obvious reasons. I would say I drink every week, some nights it's literally a beer after work at home, sometimes I do go out with friends and I end up drinking a lot and taking cocaine with my friends, not a huge amount (half a gram max) and I do it maybe once every 2 weeks - a month. I find coke makes me depressed the next day (common) as well. I know it's easy to say ""say no"" or ""you're hanging out with the wrong people"" but I've reluctantly been taking it semi-regularly for around 5 years now and when you're drunk it is so hard to say no, it's like my body sniffs the line for me without me being able to control it and after wards I'm left to think about the ""decision"" I've made, furthermore due to my stutter I don't feel like i can go out and just make new friends easily. I mentioned this in case anyone else has had a similar experience with long term drug use and can offer advice on this.

tl;dr: I feel like I have problems with the following: My stutter which causes great anxiety although never used to, I can't concentrate, I have no discipline, I've had an existential crisis and I use alcohol and cocaine occasionally.

Any help with any one or all of the points I've made would be greatly appreciated.",07Jul2020,1
229,"So some backstory is when I was 5 my father died in front of me and my sister which means my mom raised us by herself.She wasn't the worse mother but she has mental issues of her own and my sister would fight with her constantly throwing fits like she was a toddler.Im a 16 year old male ive been diagnosed with depression and ptsd my younger sister is 14 years old.For most of my life my younger sister abused me by hitting me,throwing razor blades at me,telling me to slit my wrist(I've struggled with self harm from the age of 12).

Yet to receive any answers, but don't want to coax anyone into helping, it's just disappointing...   


I don't have access to therapy at the moment and I've been feeling awful lately. My friends don't listen or ask how I'm doing really much less talk me through tough times, my cat passed away last week, I'm still not over it, working is a nightmare with this state of mind and overall everything is just shit. 

I wanted to look for online counseling since covid is in the way, even considered BetterHelp but I don't think paying for someone to just chat is worth it. It makes me sad, I have no one to talk to and to be able to I should pay almost 300$ for a whole month... That's just depressing. I'm not suicidal and I'm so proud I don't self harm anymore, but existing didn't become any less empty and pointless, especially with all my friends feeling bad too, and every relationship of mine just declining and everyone keeps closing off more and more.

236,"I am a 26 yo female. For a long time I had the feeling that I am not normal, and I think I might be on the spectrum and never diagnosed, but not sure? My parents never had me see a therapist or anything as a child.

Here are some reasons why I think i might be on the spectrum:

* difficulty understanding what others are thinking and feeling
* anxious about social situations
* difficulty making friends/maintaining relationships
(have no friends, people call me weird/ always walking on eggshells)
* seem blunt/rude/uninterested without meaning to
(people have called me arrogant, condescending, because of my tone of voice. I also say things that are rude/inappropriate without thinking/realizing)
* anxious/uncontrollable emotions when my routine changes or things don't go as planned
(ex. shutting down when plans get cancelled, small inconveniences like forgetting to buy rice when I intended on cooking it that day made me shut down and not able to do anything for the rest of the day, hiding under my desk in my office at the end of summer before the new school year begins (impending routine change), etc)
* don't understand social cues/etiquette
(wrong inflections in voice, talking over people, offending others, avoiding eye contact. People often think I am upset)
* sensitive to sounds/smell, notice patterns often. I often can notice sounds and smells that no one around me notices
* need carefully thought out plans ahead of time
* prefer to be alone, anxious with social gatherings
(examples from childhood: hiding in my room every time i had a birthday party, running away from family during gatherings. For example, I ran away once at a family picnic because I didn't want to play with my cousins. Another time I ran away from our house during a thunderstorm because the noise scared me, I was found hours later at the nearby park hiding in the playground area)
* can't control volume in voice (inappropriate volume, I am very loud, and often seem like I am yelling even though to me it feels like my normal voice. I am told often to quiet down in public places by friends/family, and have been told at work that I am too loud)
* very good at music/math, but not good at anything else. (Learned pretty much everything there is to know about piano by age 13, and then started teaching music at my local conservatory of music from age 14. Am now an engineer, my highest skills being math and programming)
* obsessive behaviour (playing the same song on piano repeatedly for hours (sometimes 6 hours at a time, it drives my family crazy), won't sleep or do anything until project/assignment is completed, sometimes not sleeping for days)
* excessive focus on myself (talking about myself too much, been told I always try to ""one-up"" people when being told a story)

I don't think I talk too much or have an obsession about one particular subject though.

I have not really met anyone who I know of that has autism, so I don't really know what it's actually like other than what I've read on google. Maybe this doesn't sound anything like autism? 

Does this sound anything like autism? I just started seeing a therapist because I've been having a lot of breakdowns lately, should I bring this up to her? If this doesn't sound like autism to you, do you have an idea of what it could be?",07Jul2020,1
237,"I don't really know how to describe everything, so I'm just gonna start by rambling. I'm an 18 year old (F) and I have been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety in the past. But I've been noticing lately that things have been getting a little worse for me? Some days, I'll be completely and totally fine. I'll be happy and super super productive at work and wanting to go out with my friends and do fun things and I'll be in the best moods I've ever been in. But sometimes, it's the exact opposite and I want to pull my hair out with how intensely depressed I get. I start having really dark thoughts and sometimes my brain feels like it's racing around and around in circles with these thoughts. I can't sleep sometimes, but sometimes the thought of not sleeping makes me want to scream. I burst out into tears out of nowhere and just have the worst feelings of anxiety, paranoia and deep deep misery. Even just the thought of waking up gives me panic attacks sometimes. But I’ve noticed that there will be periods of time where I feel like I’m on fucking cocaine or something, I just feel so so so so incredibly alive. I'll drive really fast, sticking my head out the window, not caring where my car goes.

I've tried to figure out what's wrong with me on my own, but I know that's stupid. After a lot of research? I started looking into Bipolar 2, and a lot of it sounds exactly like what I’ve been going through. I don’t quite understand the mood swings though, so if someone could explain, I’d really appreciate it. Because I’ll have mood swings throughout the day where I’ll be extremely depressed/tired/unmotivated/suicidal thoughts/staring into the void/unable to move/wanting to be alone/nothing feeling real, to being energized/happy/motivated/adventurous/high spirited, within a span of a couple hours. I’ll be having so so so much fun with my friends and then suddenly its literally like flipping a switch where I’m so irritable and sad and don’t want to be around people in the slightest, no matter how much I love them. And from what I gathered when reading about Bipolar 2, it doesn’t happen that fast? Or maybe it does and I’m misunderstanding something? I don’t want to self diagnose, but I’ve never been to a doctor that has taken me seriously. And I’m really bad at articulating just how I’m feeling when it comes to doctors/friends/literally anyone. 

I’m not looking for a diagnosis here either, I’m just looking for advice. I’d love to hear people’s similar  experiences and maybe hear from someone who has bipolar 2?

258,"I don't know if this is the right place, but atm I have no where else to go. I'm a 25(M), life has been strange for a while. I've been home for 2 years now, in a suburb Long Island neighborhood. Every so often I go through cycles of some kind. Basically right now, and for the past week it's like everything has vanished. I'm floating in the void inside my own head, and as I sit here I can't find the words to explain everything. I'm currently between therapists, I was receiving free therapy from my school that I just graduated from, so I have no one to go to and I can't find anyone to dump this on. The COVID situation is making my job market nonexistent. I'm applying for teacher positions, but everyday I feel like I'm going to have to wait another year and work the job I can't stand, service. That might not sound like a big deal, but I have epilepsy and i take daily medication. In a year (Feb 2021) I am taken off my parents medical insurance, so i NEED a job with medical. Since moving home my social life has taken a nose dive with all my friends moving on with their lives. I had to go back to school for a certification which was a two years program so i threw myself at it with full force (bad undergrad GPA put me immediately on academic probation) and i never bothered making new friends or trying to find a relationship, which is another can of worms. Right before COVID began I was telling myself that this year I was going to change things. I wanted to change, find new people, a partner, a new life I could make my own. The teacher job market looked promising, my grades were stellar, I had lost a great amount of weight and was feeling amazing. Now everything feels like its fallen apart. I can't stand another year at home, I feel stuck here and unable to change. I cant justify moving because I only have like $25,000 saved up and it just doesn't feel like enough to try and start a life with. Even as I write this I feel like I'm complaining about nothing, everyone as issues, I'm no different. I'm struggling to even post this because other people could use the attention and I can just figure this out myself. But when I look in the mirror I just see disappointment. I feel lost and scared and angry and hope feels like its slipping away every day. I just want to break everything and lay in the wreckage, but I know that isn't the way. I dont want pity and at the same time I just want someone to sit down with and tell me it's okay and the fear and anxiety and self loathing is only temporary. I want direction, but at the same time I want to find the path myself. I want to hit something and defend myself, but I also just want to world to cave in and end this horrible feeling I feel in my head and chest. I feel like I've hit a dead end and I can scale the wall to freedom or accept it's over. But it's not over, my life has only begun. 

TLDR: Please help, I need all sorts of life advice.

259,"Just mentioning beforehand that I have thoughts of suicide, just saw a bridge on the way home and was thinking about something random like how big the sign was so close up (I was in a car) and then my mind just immediately switched to wanting to jump. But I have no plans of killing myself as of right now, I just need some words of encouragement so that I don't go any lower. 

To start off, I have anxiety and depression and have been diagnosed for about 4 months. I started taking Abilify about a month ago, and the first week of 2 mg I felt great, and then it stopped working after a week. The doctor increased to 5 mg, which worked great again but now I can feel the same thing happening and just not working anymore. 

I am currently a pharmacy student and on rotations for 3 weeks. For those who don't know, basically we go to a pharmacy in different settings, hospital for me, and just shadow, learn the job, stuff like that. I'm about halfway into it and I just don't want to do it anymore. This, school, just everything. I made so many mistakes that are probably no big deal but anxiety makes it so much worse. Pharmacists are the last check before a medication goes out to a patient. With anxiety, I doubt my decisions every time and just paranoid that I did something wrong. I don't know what I want to do when I graduate and I have a really bad knee and ankle from a sprain few years ago so I don't know how long my body will hold out in retail (that's where I work at now). 

I don't have my psychiatrist appointment until next week, my counseling appointment isn't until Friday  (and he's pretty bad about checking and responding to emails so I don't want to bother him) and I don't want to bother my friend with my problems. I thought about suicide hotline but honestly I didn't find it very personable. I need some support to get the courage to get through...this thought? Day? rest of the week? I just need some encouragement",07Jul2020,1
260,"I always moved ahead in my life by asking one question- ""what is worst that can happen"".  When I was a healthy, content person, my answer used to be "" worst case scenario I might die!!"". Now when I ask myself the same question, I can only think about my parents being sad. There is nothing else that holding me here... I can't even decide if it is good that I have people who care about me, or is it bad that I can't care about me anymore???",07Jul2020,1
261,"I started seeing a therapist in December, who prescribed me Trintellix for depression. While I initially felt better, I've now come to the conclusion that that was more or less a placebo. I've never felt more depressed in my life.

Sometimes talking to my therapist makes me feel worse. She's not a bad person or anything, I just don't connect with her. And I really don't like this medication; it feels like there is a live wire running through my brain about to snap at any moment.

I've been having mild self harming thoughts for the past two months or so, but today was the first day that I experienced some serious suicidal thoughts. I'm not sure who to talk to about this. I like my therapist fine, and I do have a lot of friends... but I hate feeling like a burden to them. 

I know I won't act on these suicidal thoughts. I could never hurt my mother in that way. But it's so concerning that they happened nonetheless.

Basically my mental health is trash and I'm literally doing everything someone can do. Aside from therapy and medication, I work out consistently, eat well, sleep well, avoid too much alcohol, go outside... I have hobbies, but lately it's like pulling teeth to force my interest. I'm also at a prestigious grad school, but it's been so hard to keep my focus on my studies....

264,"I was scrolling through my Youtube recommended today and I stumbled upon this video ([How I Tricked My Brain To Like Doing Hard Things (dopamine detox)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QiE-M1LrZk)). I was interested in it, so I watched it at 1.25x speed.

In essence, the video talks about how high quantities of dopamine desensitises you to low quantities of dopamine, making it harder to motivate yourself to do more productive things, like studying or learning things rather than gaming or scrolling through social media.

I started to look through the comments where I found this:

&gt; ""Dopamine Detox"" and fasting are not scientifically backed in any way. Dopamine isn't just about happiness or pleasure. It has a lot of more complex functions for our brain as well. It's involved in a lot. Breaks from technology and drugs are always good for moderation and tolerance, but this isn't some fix for productivity or happiness. 

... so I started to do some research on it.

I found a bunch of articles providing somewhat conflicting information, where some say that it works, others saying that it doesn't work at all, then a couple stating that there is some science behind it, but it generally doesn't have as great of an effect as people promoting it make it out to have.

Does anyone have any experience with ""Dopamine Detoxes""? 

Would they actually make a difference in motivation?

Are there any better methods available for increasing motivation to work?",07Jul2020,1

I was hoping someone could help me understand something. What does - Bipolar affective disorder, depressed, severe - Mean? Is Bipolar affective disorder different than 1 or 2?

272,"Hello.

I am someone who has never had any history of any issues like this but I think the sooner the better.

I just went through a major family...thingy, and that was when I noticed a change. I started feeling depressed especially with school work piling and life everyday has felt like I was running and there was this really huge thing chasing me. Not sure what that thing is, but I don't even want to touch it.

Now, due to those circumstances, I have to go to my sister's place and I feel like I have no choice. I don't hate it there, I just want to stay where I am, not even sure if I am making sense, but if I said I wanted to stay back or if I talked about how I was feeling, they would chastise me for complaining about ""all the things I have"" or guilt trip me and I will feel even more depressed. They never even involve me, it is always about how they can make themselves more comfortable and never about how I feel comfortable.

Now I feel caged, I have been unstable and I feel like crying because it's not their fault. I could not even concentrate on school with this amount of uncertainty and all I want to do is sleep so that I don't have to think about all these things. I mean, when I tried to hold a pen, my hand started shaking and I wasted my whole day today again. I just want all this to end.



Maybe all this is in my head please, anyone that can help and advice on this matter I would appreciate it. Please.",07Jul2020,1
273,"Hello everyone :)
I'm sharing this here because I'd like honest opinions from people that are dealing with mental health issues themselves and are a part of this community. I really hope I'm not intruding your space by asking this question, if that is the case I will delete this post immediately, I just dont know any other way I could ask people about this.
Truth be told I am an aspiring comic book/visual novel artist and I would love writing a story about specific mental disorders and mental health issues in general. Now I do have some anxiety issues but I definitely dont have all of the disorders I'd like to feature. 
And now I'd like to ask if you think it is my place to write a story like this or if I shouldn't because I dont have first hand experience?
Now let me clarify something first. The idea to do this came from me having an interest in psychology and while researching started to learn all the stigma and misinformation that media has led us to believe about mental disorders and realizing that there is not one good character people with these disorders could relate to. So I thought hey, maybe I could?
But of course if I really were to write this I'd put my heart and soul into the research that goes into this to absolutely make sure I can portray these disorders as best as I can. I will just never know completely what it's like. And even though I have the best intentions, I can imagine if by this point having any media covering these issues could be problematic for the community already.
So if you took your time and read through this whole thing and have an opinion, then I'd really appreciate it if you could share it with me in the comment or through dms.
I hope you all have a nice day :)",07Jul2020,1

276,"Hello all.   


I've never posted here, and even this post is a bit of self-therapy just to get my thoughts out there, hopefully I'm posting in the right place.

I wanted to ask anyone who has lived long periods of their life with self-doubt, how you ""fixed"" it. I have always known I do not give myself enough credit, but it has come full circle and I can't run from it anymore, not without ruining a life-defining opportunity I've been given. I've worked for the past 8 years of my life building my career, and it occurred to me today that I do not digest criticism and adapt well when the criticism relates to a core attribute of mine. I am convinced this is because I assume that nothing I've done so far in my life has given me a reason to believe in myself.  


Sure, I've made good decisions that have made my life easy, but I believe this to be entirely luck/opportunity - based. My friends and family, my privilege, the opportunities I've been given, that stuff isn't given to everyone, and my baseline belief is that I'm not a person that could be anywhere close to where I am now without it.

So the problem is that I'm faced with a situation where I must fix this and perform at the level my career requires ( I can't fake confidence at all, and its obvious when I interact with people I feel this way about myself ). If I do not, all the support/love/opportunity my friends and family have given will be wasted, and I will have squandered not only time and money, but I'll have disappointed everyone.

This ties into the fact that my motivation is driven entirely by being valuable to other people, which feels like a big problem. Why can't I live for myself? I feel very lost. I'm approaching 30 and it feels like I've believed this for so long that I don't know how to break out of it.  


TLDR - If any of you have had similar problems living for yourself, what did you do to fix it? I don't have any insurance/money to go to therapy and I assume that's probably what I should do.

Thank you anyone who read all that, it means a lot",07Jul2020,1
