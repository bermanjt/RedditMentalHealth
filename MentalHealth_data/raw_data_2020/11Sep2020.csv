0,"I feel so lost and unsupported. My mental health seems to be the breakdown of all important relationships I have, I have a really hard time going outside. I've only been outside 3 times since March and each time I do I'm filled with great anxiety and cry in the car. I can't drive, I can't use public transport as I'm worried when I'm on it. There's great pressure on me to start learning how to drive, I was in a car crash in march which has made me so worried about leaving the house. I feel so weak and stupid. I know we are all on different paths in life but I can't help but feel behind against my twin sister who has learnt how to drive, has gotten a job etc. I feel like such a failure. A few months ago I started selling paintings for money, it's such a small amount of money and my low motivation really stops me from earning money. It's a constant weight on my mind, I need to finish the paintings but I can't. I let down customers and out of guilt lower my prices even more. People who receive government assistance for just sittinf around all day get more than i do, after all the hours i put in sitting there painting, hurting my eyes, back and mind I can't do it. I encountered this really difficult customer and she really knocked me down, since dealing with her I've stayed in bed. I just lay in my bed looking up at my canvases. I'm going to give up on painting I can't do it anymore. I have to seek out another way of getting money. IM SO ANXIOUS ABOUT SOICAL INTERACTIONS. When people talk to me in public like at the tills I'm speechless, I can't be by myself.
I can't vent to anyone, no one wants to listen to my self pitty bullshit, the truth is I feel like harming myself on a daily basis and suicidal thoughts I can't live anymore I'm sick of it. I'm a failure I have no purpose, my family hate the unmotivated person I am, they think I'm lazy. They don't know how I struggle to even get out of bed in the mornings to clean myself.  anxiety makes me do stupid things, I shaved off my eyebrows the other day stupidly I feel so ugly and worthless. I'm so tempted so so tempted everyday to hurt myself, I physically can't stop myself from hitting my head infront of people even if it's just out of excitement. I hate what I've become, so fat and ugly and worthless mess no one could love me. Everyone wants to run away from me the moment they see the real mess I am. My self hatred will never compare to what they feel toward me. I try to tell people how I feel inside and I SCARE THEM AWAY, I'm not deserving of love I'm a horrible person I should just do the world a favour and kill myself.",11Sep2020,1
1,"Im starting to wonder if ive created something for myself, or wondering if there's a name for it. I believe in higher self. I believe in inner self. I believe there's good and evil in every single one of us. I believe that life.. has already reward me because Im finally learning from past acknowledgements from past experiences.. to be aware of myself. Ive learnt that everyone is on their own journey. I know what I know about my life right now. I know everything has fallen into place systematically without me having to lift a finger in the last year. 

Everything is so beautifully effortless and I truly believe it is only going to continue for the rest of my life. Not to say negative things won't happen but I know I now have the tools and security within myself to deal with most things that could be thrown my way. 

From spending time contemplating suicide after spending weeks in a mental ward, being drug addicted.. to 8 years later having a beautiful family, drug free and having my soul mate sweep me off my feet and introducing me to this amazing life that we have now 10 years later.

Im not saying I never deal with bad situations, im saying I know in myself how to deal with them and know how to cope in most raw situations. Im not saying I dont break down when pains been inflicted in whatever way.. Im saying I understand and know how to step back.

I believe we have the universe within us, that we're gifted with the tools to understand this if and when we're ready.",11Sep2020,1
2,"I don't really know whether what is happening to me is something to be concerned about or if it is just normal but lately my daydreams have been getting more emotionally intense than I feel they have been in the past. Basically I feel like the best way to sum it up is that I often have conversations with real people in my imagination/daydreams with different scenarios that aren't real but with real people, however recently I have been getting really worked up by these daydreams and they have become a bit intrusive to my daily life. For example, I might be sitting in bed and imagine an argument about something that didn't happen (it's all made up) but after imaging it, it feels so SO real just like if the event in my mind had actually happened (I even feel like sometimes I react with more emotion to my daydreams than I would in real life). I might imagine myself loosing the argument and gradually through the daydream, my mood will shift my heart rate actually goes up and I get sad/angry about things that literally aren't real and never happened. Sometimes I will go instantly from being in a pretty ok mood to just an awful sadness quite rapidly during a daydream and the emotion will last for hours. I suspect I have depression or something as I mostly always feel very dull and it's hard to push myself through the daily routine. I'm very confused with myself right now and feel like mentally something is very wrong with me but it's all so confusing. There are so many small(ish) things I have been noticing wrong with me that don't add up but I don't know if it's worth listing them here I'm worried because usually when I talk about these problems I'm not taken seriously.",11Sep2020,1

5,"TW: medications and family stress  
Today was the day I started my second bottle of antidepressants, and lately, the people in my family ""have been seeing a difference."" Obviously, I do not feel the same. Every day gets harder with anxiety and depression trying to force me back up to my bedroom and isolate myself. The medication I am on helps a little, but its nothing compared to my mental illnesses.

Now that the school year is coming up, I have a feeling that's what's causing most of my anxiety. My family tries to understand but when I vent to them they think I'm lying. its like they don't want to think that they're causing the problems in the first place. I don't know how to get them to understand that I'm their perfect child that feels actually okay all of the time. It hurts on top of the pain of mental illness like a broken bone. When will they understand that I'm not okay?

They can see it too, and what do they do? Nothing. Act like it isn't there.

7,"(FTF meaning face to face)

Is it just me, or are these methods of delivering therapy incredibly uncomfortable?

There's something about discussing incredibly personal and difficult topics with a stranger that you aren't even in the room with that just feels wrong.

Unfortunately with COVID, this is all that most will offer right now. 

Still, having a therapy session on zoom or phone while sharing a thin-walled house with others working from home feels a bit like a couple discussing their sex life in a library or church.. I doubt those on a conference call want to hear or know about my personal issues, nor would I want others to know.

Does anyone else feel similar?",11Sep2020,1

My only &amp; best friend in NYC was also my roommate, so as you can imagine she has been through a lot with me and my bipolar disorder. My last manic episode, I said a lot of terrible things to her. She decided to move out but said she wants to continue our friendship. I came to California to be with my family while I’m getting stable and figuring out my next steps. 

When I first left, we talked the same amount. Texting all day everyday. It felt normal, but throughout the month since, things feel awkward for me. Super different and dry. We don’t laugh or tell jokes. We don’t talk about everything. It’s honestly not fun for me. She was supposed to come and visit me in California 2 weeks from now, but cancelled her trip due to work. I don’t really believe it honestly. She has so many trips coming up, but this is the only one that has to be canceled? I replied to the text saying I was super disappointed. She asked me to call her and I didn’t. I did not reply and still haven’t. 

I don’t have the right to be hurt but I am. I’m so
Done who’s like...why even continue being friends if it’s going to feel forced and uncomfortable. I was prepared to have to rebuild but it doesn’t seem like that’s gonna happen, especially since she canceled her trip. 

Should I just give up on being friends? Is that the best thing for her? Can people actually still love you after a manic episode where you shit all over them? I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to fix this or if I can. We were like sisters, and now it’s like..I feel like a new friend she wishes to shake off. I don’t know what to do. 

Do I let our friendship go? Do I try to discuss things? Do I tell her why I didn’t reply ? I don’t know what to do. 

Advice from anyone who’s been on the other end of bipolar abuse ? I’d greatly appreciate it. I hate myself so much for the wonderful friendship I’ve ruined. Maybe I never deserved it after all and this should be the end. I deserve to hear all the truths, especially the harsh truths.",11Sep2020,1

I’ve tried therapy and it didn’t work. They diagnosed me with schizotypal personality disorder, which makes sense because I spent my childhood alone so that’s probably how I developed people living in my mind, but that’s also why I became angry at the world

18,"Let me just start off with the fast that, unlike most people, quarantine has been a blessing for me; it's the happiest I've been in years. When everything hit the fan in March, my school turned to Zoom for the rest of the year, and it was a pretty lackluster/chill effort. I had barely any homework, tests, or quizzes, finals were cancelled. I had a pretty great time in this fun, unusually low-stress school environment! My whole family was home, obviously, so each day we went on walks together in the afternoon, rode bikes sometimes; it was idyllic. After the end of school, the long summer stretched ahead, and while my family and friends began to tire of being trapped inside, I cherished it. I'm not trying to sound like a hermit or anything, I love the outside world, but this isolation gave me a chance to focus on myself. I suffer from horrible self-esteem, I can't seem to exist without comparing myself to others, beating myself down when I'm not the best. School is pretty miserable for me, especially recently, since high school is so much more high-stakes. Don't get me wrong, I get good grades; I won a scholarship award and got first in the school on the National French Exam, but I never get the absolute highest test scores or report cards... To make matters worse, two of my best friends are the two smartest people in the grade (they take advanced math and were planning on taking advanced science, but that fell through, and get PERFECT grades all the while). They aren't braggy or snobby about it in the slightest, but everyone knows how genius they are, and I know that that shouldn't reflect on my self-worth, but it DOES! Anyways, back to quarantine; (my rants take on a life of their own...) during these months I really came into my own creatively. With no one to compare myself to, I gained this liberating sense of self-confidence. I began writing; essays, monologues, poems, fanfictions, songs even. I love the arts, it's what brings me joy in the midst of all the misery. In this hole of hatred that I'd dug myself into, I'd convinced myself that I wouldn't even be able to get into any colleges, much less pursue a career in the arts, which feels seemingly impossible to make a successful career out of. But through this newfound creative fire ignited within me, I began to dream. I dreamed that, I could achieve this magical, ethereal goal if I kept persisting and honing in on my craft; it would just take time and effort, which I was willing and enthusiastic to give!

But then, as I was climbing higher and higher, gaining more and more confidence and hope, school arrived. And I hate it with every inch of my being. I'm a sophomore in high school this year, taking all honors and AP Euro, the highest possible course load (at a pretty elite school). It's been just under a month since the year started (the relatively easy part of the year), and I already feel like I'm drowning. I have SO MUCH work, and on top of that, I'm a master procrastinator (in fact, I'm procrastinating while writing this!). I get the work done, but I always seem to be scrambling at last minute; the worst thing about all this is how it haunts me thinking about the better grades I'd get if I figured out a way to stop procrastinating! But, that's only one of my problems. The issue I mentioned previously, the comparison is quite possibly the worst part of this. In all of my classes, pretty much, I feel utterly stupid. I've already written a manifesto here, so I'm just going to talk about English, which is hurting me the most right now. I've really set my sights on the creative track in life, so if I don't score perfectly in History or Chemistry, it's going to hurt, but not too badly in the long run. English, though, I was expecting to fly through. Starting the year, I was ecstatic for the class, kind of selfishly waiting to show off and impress the teacher and my classmates with my creative thoughts and ideas. In class discussion though, I feel at best, average. I make the same connections as other people, and in some cases, less. In addition to feeling bad in the class, it makes me doubt all of the creative ideas I'd fostered over the summer, the projects I was so proud of... I managed to shake it off though, until I got my first in-class essay back a couple days ago. I had prepared adequately for it, I could have done more, but I was pretty busy and didn't have time to craft an earth-shattering work of art. Writing the essay felt pretty good, it wasn't my best work, but it still was something I was proud of. A couple days ago, before we got our grades back, he was talking about how most people did well, pointing out some things that we needed to work on and things some people did ""really beautifully"". Almost certain that I did at least something ""beautiful"", I was expecting a low A kind of grade; I mean, since when have I never been near the top of the class? But getting back my essay, it had a big fat 80 across the top. I looked at it multiple times, not really registering it. I must sound like a drama queen, not able to process an 80, but I was convinced I had done well, expecting a high grade! The comments said it was good writing, but my thesis was too broad, and I didn't introduce the quotes well enough... I cried multiple times that day, my self-esteem and faith in myself completely shot, the faith that I slowly and meticulously fostered over the quarantine. During those months, I had found myself. My anxiety, self-hatred, depression went away. My parents have told me that during quarantine, my attitude has completely changed, I became a new person. I didn't lash out at my family any more, I smiled more, got outside more, just enjoyed life to the fullest. Now that I'm back into the pointless cycle of school (don't even get me started on how irrelevant the US school system is...), I'm terrified of falling back into that hole. The hole where I'm angry and depressed all the time, lashing out at people and crying myself to sleep. With no faith in my future or even myself, right in that moment. 

Reading this back over, I'm horrified with how entitled I sound. I have had everything in life handed to me. I'm so privileged; I go to an amazing school, I have a great family, I get great grades, I shouldn't dare complain about my life. But, when I think about it, I would give up the material privileges I have in a second, because none of that stuff matters as much to me as my mental stability and happiness. Months ago, I was convinced that this daily, monotonous schedule was all my life could be. That the stress and sadness were just givens that I had to push through. But now that I've experienced real learning, happiness, and pride, I don't want to be stuck in this destructive cycle for the years to come. I know I'll have to, though. So for now, I must spend my days doing pointless schoolwork and homework; putting aside most of the creative projects that my hands itch to work on because I simply don't have time. It really hurts, deep down, knowing that I'm sacrificing my well-being to fulfill the purposes of this rigid system we call school. My mental health is taking a nosedive and I'm scared.",11Sep2020,1

I’m in college now and I would say I’m technically doing better and I’m not depressed all the time but I’m still suicidal and the thoughts have been getting worse and worse. I’m not sure what I have. I get my college work done but I also have trouble getting out of bed a lot of the time. I take care of my hygiene but sometimes it’s a struggle to leave the house. The slightest inconvenience makes me fantasize about death. I find myself drifting off while imagining my suicide and how great it would feel. I wrote a suicide note just to see what it would say. I don’t really have a plan to do it but sometimes the urge to do it is really strong. I almost gave into self harm today (I used to cut 2+ years ago.) When I’m upset, I think about how nothing really matters. My self esteem is really bad too to the point I cry when looking in the mirror. My boyfriend is really fed up with how bad my confidence is and it is making me even more depressed and insecure. 

It’s really weird because sometimes I have fun and I can see a future but I have these dark thoughts at least once a day. Some days are 10x worse then others. Some days I can’t get out of bed and I cry and other days I feel like I can take on the world. 

Anyways, to the point of it, I need therapy badly.  I feel these thoughts and urges getting worse and worse everyday. My therapist office isn’t open because of COVID but she’s doing phone appointments and I’m serious - I don’t want phone appointments. I tried a helpline before and I seriously just prefer face to face. It’s just so upsetting to me how I go to the mall and it’s absolutely packed with hundreds of people but I can’t even go to therapy. I can’t even get help with my quickly deteriorating mental health. I need it badly. By November I’m terrified I’ll be completely bed ridden from how fast my mood has been changing - it’s getting really bad now. At first it was just a thought about how I’m tired of life but now I actually am getting to the point of relapsing on self harm and crying because of how badly I want to end. I just can’t believe all the big stores near me are open and everywhere is open and people aren’t even social distancing and I can’t get help! 

I haven’t told my boyfriend how bad it is either. I know he loves me but he has gotten impatient recently with my self image issues. I really want to tell somebody other then my therapist seeing I can’t see her now and I’m scared.

28,"Been feeling like I don’t have a place to talk it out lately, and I’m not even sure why. I have a lot of support from my boyfriend and family and coworkers, and if I’m being totally honest, this is the longest streak of mental stability I’ve achieved in a few years. I’ve held an awesome job since January (I got hired just three months after I quit my meds cold turkey) and I’ve saved up enough to finally move back out on my own and start rebuilding my life after a couple of years of hard dI’m in love like I haven’t been since college and, for the first time in a long time, the future is looking sort of....not scaring the shit out of me. 

Unfortunately, these last couple weeks I have been noticing familiar feelings—the type that have proven to cause me to wreak havoc in my past. The panic attacks have reintroduced themselves after months of no incident; eating is difficult; sleep is my enemy; and the things I usually really enjoy are starting to irritate me (I enjoyed my job, now my coworkers are pissing me off; I appreciated my bf’s goofiness and silly playful attitude, now I wish he’d stop) Now, this ain’t my first ro-day-oh so I’m doing what I can in my power to fight these feelings, because losing all over again is a god awful, gut-wrenching thought.

I have been forcing myself to stay fed, and picked up a little extra weed to treat myself and keep me motivated. Still doing my morning stretches more days of the week than not, still showing up on time to work, showered with clean clothes. Still meditating before bed. I’m really, really trying to not let this get the best of me, but today I was snapping at my boyfriend like I never have, and when he didn’t deserve it at all. That, of course, hit my guilt button and I recoiled and isolated myself. I thought he was just going to leave me alone to pout but he pulled me into him and let me cry it out. He wasn’t mad at me, and I was genuinely comforted. 

Nowadays, I’m pretty confident in myself to identify the source of my anguish...right now, however, I feel lost. My head hurts, and I haven’t showered yet (I told myself I didn’t have to because it’s my day off). I know I have been stressed trying to find a place to move into, and I recently attended the funeral of someone who held a very special place in my heart. As much as I don’t want to admit that plays a HUGE role, I know it does. Wasn’t my first loss, but it was a tough one, and I keep telling myself that’s not the reason for my mood shift because I’ve already dealt with the suicide of my best friend, and the sudden death of a boyfriend in college, and many others in between...like I should be used to it by now? 

Like the title, though, I forget about my diagnoses and what I’ve gone through to get here....but I also forget about just how far I’ve come. Like I tagged, just venting. I honestly feel a bit better after making my thoughts somewhat tangible.",11Sep2020,1

30,"Apologies if my post is badly structured, and if I repeat anything. And if I set the flair incorrectly, please do tell me what flair would be more appropriate.

My significant other had a panic attack earlier. Being cities apart, I tried to do my best to help her: I sang for her (which she says calms her down a lot, but didn't help this time), I tried just sending audios of me telling her to slow down and that she'll be okay, asking her to remember specific events we'd had together, etc. But nothing seemed to work.

For context, she lives with her mother, sister and niece. She doesn't have a particularly good relation with her sister from what I know, and she's conscious about anything to do with her mother because she's busy and such. That may or may not be why, but she doesn't tell anything related to mental health to her mother, or her sister, for that matter.

It's not the first time she has a panic attack and I'm not present to help. And sadly it's not the first time I've failed to help. 

I don't trust her not to do anything *regrettable* when she's in such state. In the past she would take a bunch of pills to induce stupor and stop... panicking. Since we started dating, she hasn't done it many times, but I know she has before, and she did this time as well.

So what happened is, she suddenly stopped talking about how she was panicking and all, and she just said it was okay, and that she was going to be okay. Knowing what it meant, I asked if she took any pills, but she just kept saying it was okay. So, again, not trusting her not to do anything bad in such a state, I messaged her sister and told her the situation, asking her to keep an eye on her sister. My significant other, of course, got mad at me, and kept telling her sister she was okay. Still, at least her sister said she hid all meds in the house with her.

Personally I'm a bit of a wreck right now, but I can take a lot, so I'll be fine (I won't lie, though, I will deeply appreciate any validation that I've done right). But I'd like to ask a couple things... First being whether I should've done anything different; whether I was right to tell someone who could be there and keep an eye on her. To me, I'd rather have her be safe and mad at me than just doing nothing and risking her possibly overdosing, or attempting suicide. The second is what else I can and/or should do to try and help someone having a panic attack while not being physically with them.",11Sep2020,1

In the morning it’s because people woke her up (moms getting ready for work, I have to get ready for school zoom meetings) and my sister comes out and yells  “inconsiderate pieces of shit I’m trying to sleep” “be loud some more why don’t you when I lose sleep and die of sleep deprivation then you’ll be sorry” things like that.  Causing a massive argument or my mom to leave in a very pissed off mood. Not a great way to start the day. 

During the day - she yells at her cats because they cry at her door because they want food. She throws stuffed animals at them. I end up having to feed them and luckily my zoom meetings are usually on mute because around 10:30ish everyday my dad and sister usually get into major arguments. Then my dad goes back to his office (he works from home). 

Tonight - there is “no” food here (there’s spaghetti, Mac &amp;amp;amp; cheese, stuff to make sandwiches, pizza, burgers) and my mom came home from work and bought food for herself my sister saw that and screamed and started crying. “I knew you didn’t give a fuck about me, you selfish stuck up bitch” “you just want me to starve and die you don’t love me because if you did you would get me food” she does this ALL the time whenever somebody doesn’t get her food, and then she attacked my mom for making Mac &amp;amp;amp; cheese the other day “why did you make the Mac &amp;amp;amp; cheese it’s inedible and fucking disgusting you used too much flour in the roo” my mom made it because she had a meltdown the other day and she was trying to be nice and cheer my sister up (she was crying, screaming, stomping and throwing herself on the floor all because my dad suggested she gets a part time job so she can get out of the house more). My sister then threw the Mac and cheese out and told her to never cook again if she can’t do it right.

My sister will also say the meanest things too. To EVERYONE. She’s very vulgar. Very hostile and very mean and nasty. She will attack you even if unprovoked. I was watching a YouTube video and she came downstairs saying she wishes I was dead and that I’m a waste of space and a loser and nobody likes me. (Actually unlike you, I DO have friends, like Speak for yourself, you literally have NO friends and haven’t had any for years). 

my mom and dad always tell her to lower her voice and don’t talk to them like that and she said “don’t tell me what to fucking do or how to talk” she says that ALL the time to both of my parents. She treats them like absolute garbage. 

She is extremely mouthy and loves to scream and cry and throw tantrums (YES TANTRUMS) when she doesn’t get her way or when she’s told to do something for herself (go to the grocery store, drive her car around so it doesn’t die, take care of her pets, wash her clothes, take a shower) ANYTHING sets her off into a rage. She screams she can’t do it and it’s too much and nobody cares about her. Somehow everything reverts back to “you just wish I was dead, you hope I die soon” something revolving around death. When nobody ever tells her they wishes she was dead or anything like that. 

She loves to scream when there’s no food here she likes she blames everyone (you don’t love me you wish I was dead maybe I’ll starve and die) and slams cabinets and stomps up the stairs. You can’t say anything to her without her flipping out and it’s getting old. 

My friend who lives down the street from us can hear my sister yelling from her yard. She will literally scream like she’s getting murdered and throw things and stomp around. She claims to have social anxiety which is why she can’t go out in public or do anything by herself and the thought of it makes her freak out. But she can go out in public with her family? It makes no sense. 

If I try and stay out of her way because of her moods she takes notice of that and tries to start arguments. I’m so sick of being in this house with her and dealing with her. I can’t go to relatives because they live out of state and I have no way of getting there. I can only stay at my friends house for like a night. My friends don’t like her because SHE IS MEAN TO THEM. They did NOTHING to her.",11Sep2020,1
32,"So my mother had a stroke about 10 years ago after complications due to her alcoholism. Many things have happened throughout her recovery including relapses, however now her main issue is phases of paranoia. It was very severe a couple years ago, but at present it involves suspicions that my father is cheating on her, trying to poison her, stealing her things etc. It really sucks because my dad works really hard to take care of her and has stuck around through it all. I am writing here to ask if anyone has resources for families dealing with this sort of behavior. Specifically my dad wants some reading material on how to best cope with her accusations. I’ve recommended he go to therapy but unfortunately he’s not very receptive. Kay folks, ask follow up questions if you’d like or feedback. I’d love it, thank you!",11Sep2020,1

34,"I don't know what to do anymore or how to process this. Should I feel disappointed, disgusted, sad, angry, hurt, humiliated ? 
Today I found out that my Dad is seeing this another woman who is like 25 years younger to him. I literally caught him red handed in the act. Not once but thrice. I have not confronted him or told my mom. My mom is scheduled for surgery next week. I don't wanna make it worse for her. 
This isn't the first time that he is doing this. He cheated on her 7 to 8 years back when I was 12. He got caught. It was a mess back then too. Their families got involved. The other woman's family got involved. His workplace people got to know about it. He lost his promotion because of his bad character. I think he ended up paying a huge amount of money to that woman back then too. I lost all respect for him back then and our family has never really gotten back together again. 
My parents keep fighting all the time even over petty matters. I won't place the blame of all the fights on him but he ain't clean either. I don't know why are they still going on with this marriage. I guess the society we live in plays a major role in that. 
But what do I do now? I haven't been able to develop any kind of attachment  towards anybody since the previous episode. I used to play a lot of ball to forget about things but I tore a ligament last year and now that's gone. No more balling. Now this. I do not have anybody to talk to either. More like, whom should I trust these things with? My mom? She already has her plate full. I have a few friends but I just can't share these things with them. I feel like crying but the tears won't come out.
I know I can't change my dad cuz he is way past that point but how do I end this feeling? I tried a lot to suppress my emotions but that only made me more lonelier. I don't wanna live like this anymore. Please help.",11Sep2020,1
35,"I’m here, sat on my bed, on reddit...*sigh*

And I was moaning about school just three hours ago. If only I could just lift this burden off my shoulders.... and be free...

36," hey  all. i'm not sure if this is the place to post this. i have some  questions about the intersection between psychology/psychoanalysis and  non-binary experiences. rant ahead:

my  identity in general has always fluctuated a lot. in particular, i  started questioning my gender identity (afab) around when i was 15. i'm  20, almost 21 now.

this  questioning has meant experimenting with haircuts, clothes, etc. i was  always very uncomfortable with the fem clothes i had as a teen. i feel  like i have now kind of found my groove wearing looser sweatpants,  longer sweaters, beanies, shirts buttoned up, short hair, etc. when i  try to explain these things, even (especially) to myself, they get  muddled. do i like short hair because it's more masc? what does masc  even mean? just how useful/interesting are those two items, from a  binary categorization? these are more general questions.

anyways,  over the past 3-4 years i've felt more and more disconnected from my  chest. sometimes it's on the more aesthetic side (how i look), sometimes  it's more on the experiential side (how i/they feel). while my  (self-diagnosed) dysphoria is overall chill, at some points, it's gotten  to be pretty bad, causing a kind of dissociation. i don't want these  things on me, they feel external, as if they had been placed on me  without my agreement.

in that line  of thought, i have been considering and thinking about top surgery.  this had always been around my headspace, but i only seriously started  to consider it this july. because of covid, and being on a trial period  for a new job (which means i can't take any days off until the end of  the year), i probably wouldn't be moving forward with this, if i wanted  to, until beginning of 2021, as in actually going to see the surgeon and  talking about the surgery. i had a videoconsultation with another  surgeon who gave me a general overview and was very nice about  everything. it got me really excited, and it was simultaneously really  calming to see that there *are*  things one can do to feel better. it was also calming to realize that no  one is rushing me: i feel more comfortable giving myself another couple  of months to think about it before actually making a decision.

now  to my actual question. i've been in therapy, psychoanalytic therapy,  for the past 2 years-ish. i live in buenos aires, so i think undergoing  analysis is much more common here than elsewhere (something like 70% of  people are in psychoanalytic therapy).

my  chest dysphoria and overall discomfort with my gender identity has been  peppered in throughout my analysis, from the very start. my analyst  knows that being uncomfortable with my chest is not something new.  however, for the past couple of sessions, since i told her that i am  considering top surgery, i have been getting a vibe that i feel as  dismissive/questioning (in the bad sense of the word). once, she said  something like ""could it be too much mother""? she was linking ""mama"" (as  in breast) to ""mamá"" (as in mom). i thought it was one of those  eye-rolly psychoanalytic reductionisms. the way she got there was tied  to something about rules (which she had brought up, not me). the session  after that, i asked her what she meant, what the ""it"" in ""could it be  ..."" was.

when i pressed her to  explain the link between what i had been talking about regarding top  surgery and ""rules"", she ended up asking something like: is this a rule  you want to break for spite/just because/*against* the rule (so, against the rule's status as that)? or do you want to build/go *for* something, which requires breaking a rule (more against the rule's content)?

i  assumed the ""it"" in ""could it be ..."" was my identity. i felt hurt and  dismissed because it felt like she was equating any gender experience i  had to my mom's effect on me, as if that were some kind of direct  explanation, and i couldn't account for anything i felt. i know that  that's only how i respond to what she says, but it's really making me  curious.

her question about the  reason for rule-breaking kind of threw me off. growing up, i had a  specific tendendy to break rules for fun. if someone told me don't do x,  i would go and do it, even if i had not previous intention of doing  that. my 5th grade teacher baptized me as ""rebel without a cause"". as a  young adult, i guess that's been sublimated into an enjoyment of playing  devil's advocate in intellectual discussions, for example, but i would  say i am now a person who follows rules (maybe too much).

a  couple of disclaimers: 1) i've translated our conversation, which took  place in spanish, so there might be things left out/included externally  because of that 2) i know it depends on many case-by-case factors that  only analyst and analysand as parties in an analysis can get to know  (things i couldn't possibly include in a reddit post).

psychoanalytic-inclined  folks, especially those with a gender perspective, what are your takes  on this? where does one draw the line between old-fashioned,  conservative psychoanalysis and it's somewhat rotten take on gender, and  someone actually asking the right questions?

one  part of me thinks that all these questions that popped up are a good  sign, and that the analysis is being steered in an interesting way (if i  care so much, there must be something behind this). another part of me  thinks that the hurt and anguish these interventions cause in me cannot  be for the best of me. i am sad/angry/tired of hearing that kind of  dismissive discourse, and did not expect this from her (i know she is  involved in several ""progressive"" circles).",11Sep2020,1
37,"I have been trying to improve my emotional intelligence. My idea of emotional intelligence is "" the capacity to be aware of, control, and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically"", so basically the google definition.

I have read numerous articles and watched videos about emotional intelligence. I have been trying to implement it in my life but the problem is it feels like I am bottling up my anger.

When something mildly inconvenient happens, I would normally get really mad for a second because that is how mentally weak I am but now, whenever something mildly inconvenient happens, I tell myself to calm down but it feels more like I am putting that anger in a pocket to deal with later. And then everything builds up and at the end of the day and something makes me actually mad, and then all the anger from throughout the day comes back and I feel a really powerful self hatred and such a strong urge to hurt myself.

I really don't know what to do because this is my idea of emotional intelligence. I feel powerful when I am putting my feelings in my pocket throughout the day, but then when something happens that sends me over the edge it feels so bad. I just had a break down and I hate this.

TLDR; how do you walk the line between ""emotional intelligence"" and emotional expression (or what is your idea of emotional intelligence""?",11Sep2020,1

39,"I have been so scared to do something like this but all my friends have told me this is the best thing I can do right now. So I want to talk about my mental problems.. And to talk about them you should know why I have them. My family was homeless and we where living with my grandmother on my mom's side. Now the thing about my grandmother is.. She has a lot of.. stuff in her head.. She is really messed up.. She mental and physically abused my mother for many years.. And when we lived with her she did the same to me and my siblings.. I have some memory of this but not a lot.. I was very young at the time and I don't really remember a lot.. But I remember her shoving food down my throat, yelling at me and hitting me when I threw up and throwing me in the shower with all my clothes on.. and after a few months of living with her I remember the day she locked my father outside as she beat my mother.. I use to only remember the sound but.. I remember everything now.. and the next day my mother moved out with us... My mother went though a very bad depression and for a very long time I felt like she was a zombie on her bed doing nothing.. My mother and father had very bad fights and my two older brothers would try and kill one another and around this time we had roommates as we where very low on money.. one of these roommates being a child predator.. I was still very young at this point but after all of that we moved into another house.. And this hose is where I discovered what self-hate was.. And what self-harm was.. I was home schooled so a lot of the time I was alone.. The more I was alone the darker my thoughts where.. The more I hated myself.. I found everything to hate about myself.. I scratched the top of my had so badly I gave myself a first degree burn.. And it got infected.. My mother had to disinfect it herself .. when she did this she would ask me why I did it and I told her ""I hate myself"" and she would just tell me ""no you don't"" then when people saw the thing on my hand my mother would say its a stress thing.. it was around this time I got discord.. So I could roleplay online.. I would be someone else.. and be somewhere else.. My mother and father fought a lot still and my mother and brother where fighting as well.. at this time I still had no one to talk to about my feelings and what I wanted to do.. and after a year we where kicked out of that house..   
Now that you know all that I want to tell you what I feel is wrong with me..

When I first had friends after being so lonely I get held onto them.. but they where not good people.. making me further believe I was a bad person.. and in this group of friends I started dating one of them.. In this she made me feel even smaller.. I felt as if she was better then me.. she was worth more then me.. and that's why I stayed with her.. because I thought that's what love was.. but after a while I broke up with her.. I felt guilty for breaking her heart..

I cannot handle when people yell at me.. I start to cry and break down.. I get scared when people say they are going to throw me into a pool.. I had a panic attack when my friends where just messing around saying they where going to throw me into the pool but when they started to get out of the pool I panicked..

when I have panic attacks I feel like I am no longer in my body.. when I close my eyes and I'm in that darkness I feel like I have lost control of my body.. I hate it..

I get scared of my own brothers.. when they get mad and start acting out I get so scared.. I hide and I just don't talk to them.. thats why I never tell on them or anything.. I just so scared..

there is so much more but I feel like this post is big enough.. 

so there is a lot of my mental stuff.. can someone tell me.. why I'm like this?.. and how I can get help..

my mom doesn't believe is therapy but.. I really want someone to tell whats wrong with me.. and why I am what I am and why I act like this..",11Sep2020,1
40,"We all support each other in my friend group but I'm the typical ""thearpist Friend"" always there when you need me giving you the best advice and Emotional support I can. I usually say the right thing make them feel better, but I couldn't today. 

My friend has a very toxic home life, it may even be abusive but if it is he isn't telling us that. That plus school and just mental illness in general has really been pushing him to the edge. It's so hard to hear him talk about how he hates himself, how he's worthless, how he just wants to die. When really all he wants is to escape. I'm there for him however I can be, we all are. But today while I was offline he was really just not doing well, we were scared for his safety and well-being but knew he wasn't in immediate danger, but I know we were all terrified.

My friend tried to talk to him, but she was panicking and the other one had no clue what to do. The both Dm me. The both were begging for my help, they didn't know what to say or what to do so they turned to me. But I didn't know what to say either for the first time in so long i couldn't console them. I told them the truth, that I was scared to. I'm not supposed to say that, I know that they wanted me to have all the answers but I don't and I'm sorry. 

I really wish I did. If I knew what to do then he wouldn't be in such a terrible position. If I knew what to do maybe I could sleep at night, maybe I would stop breaking down at the thought of what he might do to himself if we don't act soon. My stomach has been in knots bc if the anxiety. Im exhausted and it shows. I can't cope with losing any of them, shit I can't even cope with the ***Thought*** of losing them. I really want to pick up my old sh habits I know if I just cut myself that I could calm down and re focus. Then I could just focus on keeping everyone stable make sure they know everything is going to be okay

Back in June, we've had a rough time, but we survived and are still together.

I got non-treated anxiety (next step is getting help). I really want my relationship to work. I love him.

But I've had bad thoughts recently, thinking about how I should break up, and then telling myself I should not, he would be sad and I would. I can't think of me without him. But the thoughts keep coming back.

He has some anger issues sometimes, coming from trauma he had younger. I've been vocal about how it upsets me, I get sad and anxious, but it's hard for him to just ""stop"".

I don't like my type of work, but I just started right before the pandemic kicked in. Its too early to quit and its probably hard to find a new one right now. The people are nice, but I only ever met them all online. Workload is something I thought I would never put myself into doing. Yet here I am, at least its paying the bills.

I've been doubting everything and everyone lately. Even when coworkers reach other and offer help on my workload, which I do accept cuz it means less work for me, but of course I would feel bad and not enough since I always receive offers of help. Even when they compliment my work, I feel they only say that to keep me in the company. But do they also really need me anyway? I'm slow, and usually not meeting the deadlines right.

I don’t know why things just seem to get more complicated and harder as you get older. I have made good decisions and it seems those who game the system live better lives.

52,"Ive had it. This has been the worst year of my life. For years I dwelled on the truama I had but this year did it for me. Ive grown but idk if im better this way. I wish I knew what I did now without having to feel so broken. My year started with me still in an abusive relationship. By this point this man had raped. Strangled. Beaten. Degraded. Embarrassed. Manipulated me on so many occasions and at the time I was pregnant. I got into the relationship the year prior almost becoming a stripper until I was raped by someone else right in the middle of meeting my now ex. Got kicked out and my mom dumped me on this man so for months i had to deal with all that trying to avoid being homeless and still truamatized by my rape (that my ex blamed me for at any chance saying I liked it and accusing me of cheating even tho at that time I wasnt even romantically talking to him) he beat me on my birthday. I get pregnant as stated and not having the heart to abort I chose to keep it. I miscarry that feb after being dragged and blinded for 2 months from nerve damage after he hit me and after when I refuse to come back until he gets complete mental health with proof for an extended period of time after he begged me to be in the childs life still he leaves me for a 15 y/o. Fast forward im kicked out again 
(my mother suffers w mental issues and after tripping on a cord no lies tripping on a cord i used to charge my phone kicks me out) 
While living there at a point i was homeless in jersey running around w a guy who im still good w, come back and end up living w a friend. Things seemed like it could get better. I start talking to a guy ive known 3 years as a friend and had a crush on for longer. 
Things were a dream for a bit. 
Alot still was going on but i had my friend and started having income. 
Fast forward again he sleeps w a girl. 
We are not official so i state my emotions but only ask to be respected enough for him to be upfront if something like this came up again but made it clear in a  commited relationship i would not be ok with any of that mess. 
Things are rocky a bit as he wanted space because he felt guilty and I didnt respect that still treating things the same. He told me to at first but i should of read him better. 
My ex hmu finally ready to get therapy about to be in fed prison for fed drug charges and states he wants to give me room to finally get my peace w him. 
I wanted so bad to have that at the time for so long as than and even now wounds had not healed. I thought telljng him off and telling him about himself would be what I needed to heal because he felt like this demon I had on my back.
 He assures me we'll be in public knowing i didnt trust him only to eventually trick me into being alone ( i thought a friend would b w us ) attacks me. 
I end up going over every way to kill any method he could have of popping back up again and carry that weight until situations with who I talk to get worse and I try explaining my mental finally after being scared it be too much of a weight for him.
 Inbetween we argue because of a trip he said was cool if i take that i took. We make up and i end up pregnant again. 
He already has a child and not the best situation and after a point it affacted me so bad pysically i had to abort. In this time hes blaming me for not takjng a plan b and leaves me to take care of myself. 
Mind you it was so bad i could not even drink water without throwing up and was in do much pain was stuck on the couch for 2 months still bleeding now 2 months after from the procedure.
 Hes back n forth ever since opting to ignore me when issues in his life come up. 
Two weeks ago he sleeps with another girl. Hes in a broken state so i console him mind you he does this after were on the phone that sun, get into it after i have a mental breakdown and want to go to my moms after getting his package but have the only house key.
 He calls asking me to wait for him and at first tries to understand whats wrong progressively getting madder and yelling at me (i had a calm tone, did not yell or curse) hangs up on me further pushing my breakdown (but i staill go on a 2 hr mission for his mail) and is gone for a week to the beach w girls. We were supposed to go all summer. 
I had a psychotic ep that week and one of those same days he posts him with two other girls i hear my late grandmothers last living and closest friend has dementia like she had. since that ep i havent been right or felt the same. 
I was already broken but have been completely on edge and feel like im going to snap. Fast forward last week. 
Things are ok but not ok with me and him. He thanks me for standing by him and were all cutesy. This week nothing bad necessarily happened but as a run through. He hasnt been mean but distantish which i tried not to think too deep into because he was working on clothes. 
I started a new job this week and me and him have things coming up planned I tried telling him how good my first day went two days ago. He calls back twice n ends up teplying sayjng thats good n on mon even called to make sure i was good.
 I try calling him back like i stated on text when i got back to my moms (ive been staying for work amongst other things like how our roomate lost the house) i try calling twoce it goes to voicemail so i text him. 
No reply but he posts online the day after.
 Now that in itself to me at this point is whatever but idk....
 i havent been sitting right in my soul since that week it felt like it completely broke me and one more thing is what will send me over into my grave.
 I cant hold my thoughts in and ive been trying to be calm with him. All I wrote is only a part of everything ive been carrying but theres so much else that happened this is all I wanted to sum up as a general idea.
 Dealing with my moms slow build of bs moving back in. 
Truama.
 Feeling like a failure. 
Fully seeing how brainwashed and easy to control ive been. 
The weight from all this time and all the hurt and sadness. 
I just want to scream. 
I hate it.
 I just want to die.
 I just want everything to stop.
 I just want to be ok. 
Am I this bad ? 
Do I desrve this all ? 
Why just why ? 
Im not fucking ok and im scared i wont make it to my b day next month im scared i wont make it at all.... 
I should be happy for myself im doing so good at my new job but everything hurts.",11Sep2020,1
53,"Something is wrong with me. I have symptoms that resemble OCD or ADHD. I also have what I consider “manic” episodes, but I’m not sure they are at the extreme of what I’ve been reading about so maybe that’s not really what it is. I am constantly dopamine seeking. I can’t focus. I try to do a million things at once when I’m not occupied with a task that involves my direct attention like work, but sometimes even when I am occupied with a task I’m trying to do other things still. I go up and down so easily. I struggle with alcohol abuse. I constantly think people are mad at me, read way to into every interaction, overthink every tiny little thing. I am not stable, and I’m successfully hiding it from my loved ones and have been for years. 

I want to get help, but it’s global pandemic and I can’t afford it. Anyway, back to my glass of wine that I’m drinking by myself.",11Sep2020,1

To start, I was raised in an abusive household, mom blackout drunk 24/7, dad always in jail for domestic violence. There was violence against me and my brother too. But this post isnt about that.

My grandmother took me to about 7 therapists over the course of 2 years. Ive gone through 17 in my life in total. But Ive never truly spoken to them, because I know if I said what I felt Id be put back into foster care, or another mental hospital. 

Even with that I was diagnosed with paranoia, anxiety, depression, ect. But theres so much I couldnt talk about to anyone. And theres 2 things thatve haunted me for years. 

1. I cant look at myself for a prolonged period of time without feeling like aim not looking at me. I know its the face that I own. But at the sane time I dont. I feel like Im not me sometimes. And that Im not consciously making decisions for myself. (That one may be because of my a d d) I also feel as if I am just watching events unfold in front of me, even if I am partaking in them. 

2. This is the hardest for me. As I tried to talk to my mom about it and she sent me away to my grandmothers for multiple months. Anyways, I sometimes feel as if people arent real. Like they are clones. Not who they let on. Like. Its hard to explain, I dont know how to say it other than clones. Or imposters. But its not constant. Its like episodes. And I just want to know what this is. I hate having to not know whats wrong.",11Sep2020,1

58,"Hi, I guess I’ll start off that I’m 17 and I’ve dealt with mental health issues a majority of my life. Personally &amp; with many people I care about. 
Throughout my life, I’ve had to witness multiple people attempt suicide in-front of me, away, and I’ve survived multiple attempts. It was a technique used against me in 2 relationship, to threaten suicide then tell me they “wanted to see my reaction”. I’ve advocated heavily for mental health and the stigma around it for many years, I try to speak openly about my own struggles, in-hope that it will help others, or I run social media groups with thousands of people, and do mental health check-ins weekly with my members. and I feel like I’m so annoying.
If I know someone who has a mental illnesses, especially when I know they’re struggling, I tend to check-in a lot with them or be “extra annoying”. I take it so so seriously immediately, because my mind automatically goes to the worse case scenario. I don’t get it. Is that me being hypersensitive?

59," I am currently 20 and since I was around 10 I have lived in my head. I listen to music about anytime I got free time. When I’m not at work I’m at home in my living room rocking on a rocking chair listening to different songs that help create my fantasy worlds and I live there more then anywhere else. I don’t have any friends in real life and spend all my time in my head with the friends I create there. The fantasies sometimes change and people change sometimes depending what fandom I’m in to include them. Currently I’m in a mixed world of overwatch characters and how to train your dragon characters living the lives as the son of reaper and soldier 76 (don’t judge me please) and the son of hiccup and Dagur. The music helps me smoothly transition my fantasy. In school I used to spend recess running around talking to myself. Before I got my first iPod at 10 I didn’t have music so I would do what any child did and once again walk around my room or jump on my trampoline and talk to myself. At that age I had more made up characters. And it wasn’t like I had toys in my hands or even someone else to talk to. I would switch from high voices to a more monotone voice to reply to the first voice I had then switch over to a new person and so on. 
The problem I have now is as I stated I have no friends and I’m now 20. I feel like I don’t know how to date or make friends cause I’m so stuck in my fantasy friendships and romances. I don’t wanna ever give up my world and I’m scared one day I’ll have to if I don’t wanna be alone forever. Not only that but while at work I can’t wait to finally go home so I can go straight to my world my safe haven. I don’t know what’s wrong with me or if it’s normal. I haven’t even told my  therapist about this because Im scared of getting diagnosed with another mental illness my parents will be mad at. My mom was already upset at me for being suicidal and my dad is mad that I have adhd and anxiety. If I get diagnosed with another issue they’re gonna be so mad. I also do not want to leave my world just the though of having to live in the real world without my fantasy makes me feel sick and panicked and my anxiety spikes and I just want to cry and scream and honestly kill myself so I don’t have to withdraw from this place. I’m scared I’m scared of myself and the real world and I’m scared that somethings wrong with me but I don’t know what. My parents tell me to stop listening to that music get out there but I can’t I can’t leave them behind because they have been my only real friends since I was a child. And while some have changed over the years from naruto to Harry Potter etc. The characters I have made up to be included in these worlds are real for me. At night I wish that my fantasys were real I wish that I’ll wake up the next day and I’m the son of reaper and soldier 76, or that I am dating Draco Malfoy. I feel out of place when I “wake up” so to speak from my fantasies and I’m suddenly back in the real world. They become so real that I forget where I even was. I hate going camping or to hotels because I know there’s not many places to live my fantasies unless there’s a pool. But I enjoy the car ride there because it gives me hours to be lost from the real world. I’m so scared and I just I want to know what’s wrong with me or if I’m normal is this Normal? Does anyone else feel like this?",11Sep2020,1

63,"Not sure where to post this :/ 

Now just to clarify I love him and I think it’s great that he can make friends and form a friend group so easily just starting out in university, and I know it makes him happy so I’m happy for him 🥺 

That being unsaid I’ve always been uncomfortable whenever he talks about it :/ I almost feel betrayed that he has a friend group? It could be a mixture of things from jealousy, to insecurities, loneliness? I know there could be a lot of things and it just makes me upset that I am never truly happy for him. I feel like an evil person pretending to be happy for him when really I’m bitter and find it annoying that he has a friend group. It’s fucked up and I hate myself for it :( 

I’ve never really had a friend group myself but that’s really on my part as I get super anxious around groups and can never really join in with group discussions. I’ve kinda isolated myself for any opportunities I’ve had to form friend groups and rather have singular friends from a range of different settings, whether school, Internet, from concerts, childhood friends etc. None of my friends really know each other and I only ever hang out with them one on one. 

And I understand that this may explain why I am so frustrated with the fact that he has always had friend groups and can easily just join/form them after a weeks :/ I just want to stop feeling so uncomfortable about it. I feel like I’m lying to him when I say I’m happy for him, I’m a bitter and jealous person inside. I want to stop feeling this way but I just feel so helpless about it. I just feel like absolute shit whenever he brings up friends which is so selfish but I just end up thinking about it for the rest of the day :/ 

Idk I just feel so angry and upset with myself, in addition to feeling like I’m pretending to be happy when really I’m just a evil person

my dad was in an accident last year and thankfully he’s still alive he’s just confined to a wheelchair and cannot speak. he also has very minor motor control. my mom says i should be grateful he’s still alive and with us everyday, but i can’t help but still feel like i lost a parent. 

on top of that i’ve been having a really hard quarantine. i’m not speaking to my best friend of 5 years and i broke up with my boyfriend of a year and a half about 4 months ago. 

i can normally convince myself i’m ok and thing will get better and i’ll feel numb for a while, then i become severely depressed and it’s hard to crawl back out. i put on a smile for the people closest to me and they always tell me i’m strong but i don’t feel strong. i feel like i’m going to shatter at any moment. 

i have always struggled with mental illness (anxiety, depression, disordered eating) and the only reason i manage to push through and keep taking care of myself now is because of the lessons i learned then. but it hurts every time i get out of bed and it hurts every time i take a bite of food.

65,"When i started reading self help, the major part of all the books taught that a mind is like a computer and you're it's programmer, whatever code you do, that's how the program will turn out to be. For example, if you do positive coding , the program will come out tod be  positively and vice versa. 

So with this thought I decided to put one postive thought every day. It can be anything, a quote, few lines from a Ted talk i saw. Or few lines from the book I read that gave me a new perspective. Anything that made me go ""Wow, that's something interesting"". 

While I know that a large part of people may just read and will get done with it, or may not even believe in the power of positiveness,  but sometimes, things stays in your mind and then your mind starts thinking about that stuff all day long and if not in one day, maybe someday, someone will benefit from it. if I keep thinking that people may not read it I am robbing this joy from people who might.

68,"Streaks of indigo and pink interlaced with the sunlight. The water was hugged with light ripples as the wind stroked the surface gently. Euphoria raced through my veins as the sand caressed my toes. The rush of water hitting sand, rushing to be free, and the smell of sweet victory enveloped me. My skin tingled with ecstasy looking at the serene beauty of the calm sea, I could almost forget everything.

It was my birthday. The memory of that day was seared into my brain, ready to wreck me with anguish in moments I least expected it to.

Beautiful, kind, angelic. The three words I would use to describe Kayla. Kayla could command the room just by stepping in. It was lunch break at school when we first met. I was queuing for noodles when the lunch hall suddenly fell into pin drop silence. It was not unusual as this always happened when the teachers dropped by to pull a student out to talk. My concentration was ripped away from The Dreamwalker's Child by Steve Voake when a hand made its home on my shoulder. She was dressed head to toe in cosplay, her face heavily made up.

""Girl you seem to be the only sane person around here"" her throaty tone shocked me. 
I didn't know what to answer to that.
""you're a quiet kind huh. That's good. I'm quite a talker. You can just listen.""
I still didnt know how to react. So I smiled and just said a simple ""okay"".

Now many would wonder. What about me caught the eye of such a popular girl as Kayla. Outgoing, sociable, extroverted Kayla. I didnt know at that time. But I reeked the smell of emotional damage. Or at least that was the answer Kayla gave me when I finally dared to ask her, why me of all people.

Kayla was as good as an orphan. Her parents ditched her for drugs and alcohol. When they deemed her an obstacle to their weed and drinks, she would emerge of the house black and bruised. She ran away and found a home in mine gutter. She cried with me as my brother died to a rare disease. Or as my mum succumbed to sadness. Or my dad leaving to find someone else to replace everyone I had lost. Including me. 

She rolled up her shirt, her hand on my shoulder for support . I breathed in. Hard. ""It's ok, it's not as bad as it looks"". 
I've never seen anyone who did themselves like me.
Cut it all out. I feel so ugly like this.

If art was a way of expressing our dissatisfaction with the world, we were masterpieces. 

We wrote a pact. There was no guarantee that the fine thread that held the 2 of us together wouldn't break. But we promised that if one of us broke, the other had to live in memory,and explore the world. Especially Japan. We were fascinated by their culture. We put this pact in a container, and spent the day digging a spot on the beach to bury it. Childish, but we wanted to keep our fiery spirit for each other. 

2 girls in puffy sequined skirts dancing in the field barefooted. Everyone wondered how their feet didn't itch or the puffiness of their skirts die down as sweat began to plaster the material to their body.

We fought. I had initially persevered to keep her company. But I didn't have to do that anymore. She doesn't need my company. 

Beautiful Kayla. As I let the ocean swallow me, she rushed in to play tug of war.  The ocean beckoned me in. She snatched me out. In a flash of flailing arms and powerful wind, I could not remember what happened. But Kayla was gone. Kayla didn't know how to swim, let alone fight the strength of the current. Not Kayla . Not her. I begged the ocean to take me instead. Men came running.She was gone for too long. I blacked out.

The next thing I remembered is the girl beside me bones protruding a grey tinged skin, hooked to machines with them all  running down her arms chest, looking something like a water fountain,trying to expel the excess pain her body couldn't hold. She had scars covering the whole of her body as far as my eyes could see. She looked like me, a human being . Part of the skin on her thighs had turned white and coarse, much like a net. The scars had a variety of types, some thick, thin, horizontal, vertical, diagonal, overlapping . I wonder what her parents thought of her using blades to drown her sorrows out. I wonder what could have happened that made her desperate to self destruct. She was brought in the same time I was, splitting the poor doctors attention. Not that I minded though. Her face was the colour of eggplant at that time, but now it's brownish beige. The machines stopped whining for a long time. 

We screamed at each other. They are lying. Everyone is a liar. Kayla was waiting for me. I didnt understand why they were trying to separate us. We completed each other. We were a perfect pair. I cried and begged. It was to no avail. I rushed past them with a strength they didn't think was possible. Kayla. She wasnt there. I ran amok the hospital,barging into random people's room. Futile effort. That was when I had myself convinced that Kayla was transferred to another hospital. I begged them further to take me to Kayla. They exchanged pitying looks. No. Kayla was somewhere. They were hiding Kayla. Thats it.

""If anything happened to one of us, the other would live on to experience Okinawa. Signed, Kayla and Lea."" 

It stuck with me after a long while. I sobbed gut wretching tears as guilt flooded my entire being . I got sedated and drifted off for a very long time. This continued until I dried out all my tears again. 

I was being sent to a house for nutcases, they said. I flared. The people I met there, were more human than those outside. In them, I found new hope.I was glad to be isolated from those outside. We were never truly left alone. 

Every year, even when I have moved to Japan, I would make it a point to return to the beach where I should have left, but Kayla did for me. And I would tell her the little things I experienced living in Japan. I also made sure to go to Okinawa from Tokyo, and take pictures of the beautiful scenery that she would have loved. Knowing Kayla, she would have done the same for me. Her last actions proved that. It was too hard to stay in the place where it was my fault she was gone. If she didn't make it, I wouldn't have either. Then, I stayed alive to accompany her. Now, too but in memory.",11Sep2020,1
69,"I have been diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety, depression, and several chronic illnesses. I know this is lengthy so I'll include a Tl;Dr at the end while making key points bold.

So my mental state is terrible right now thanks to the many negative things in my life coming to the forefront of my mind after repressing them for several years**. I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for 8 years now** even though the intensity has fluctuated over the years. I have high emotional intelligence and am pretty mentally strong so, **although my suicidal thoughts are dangerously severe, I've managed to stay alive.** My sibling attempted suicide several times, so I don't want to inflict that pain on my loved ones which is the only reason I'm alive. The problem is that **I'm now not living for myself** (I haven't been for a long time) and am dealing with a mix of anger, resentment and just feeling empty. I can't live by myself as I just cannot take care of myself and, due to my chronic physical illnesses, **am constantly exhausted and in agony**. If I had the ability to end my life and for it to not affect those around me, I would take it without hesitating. When I was younger, I made several attempts on my life and I'm so angry at myself for not succeeding as I wouldn't have been through everything that is destroying me.

**At the start of this year, I had a huge mental breakdown** thanks to the end of an abusive relationship and I became a zombie. **All I could do is to stay in my bed, not being able to fulfill my needs (like food and showering), and couldn't do anything I enjoyed** even though it wouldn't've taken any effort to do. Alongside this, my emotions ranged from being extremely anxious for no reason, to being very depressed, to **not feeling anything at all, which is the most frequent state I'm in.** As I was in my final year of university but couldn't complete the work, we came to the conclusion that I would **do nearly 6 months work in six weeks**. During this time, I had opened up to my parents about my declining mental state and all the work I missed. So over the summer I had been working my butt off to get everything completed and **my parents have been as supportive as they could be and helped me in so many different ways**. Even though I managed to complete all the work, **I couldn't submit some pieces of work until after the deadline which I thought was fine as they overall would only drag my grades down a small amount.** However, when I checked my grades for this year, I found that more pieces of work were not submitted on time as I thought they were. Also one paper wasn't classified as being submitted even though it was submitted slightly after the final capped mark deadline due to technical issues which I had communicated with the university about. **Overall, this means I failed and have to redo the semester.**

So now, **all my hard work has been for nothing and I'm going to disappoint my parents further.** They were going to give me a small reward if I got the grades I would've received if I hadn't messed up. While I'm currently living with them, my parents are not happy about it as **they believe that I should be independent now in spite of my mental state.** As I knew an outcome like this could happen, I told myself that **I would kill myself if I failed**. I don't offer any worth to this world, my parents are already extremely disappointed in me so they'll probably hate me even more now, and I **needed good grades for my ideal future goals**. My future is just looking like I'm always going to struggle to live with chronic pain and fatigue, and that even though I sought out help for my mental health, the **professionals are not providing good enough support to allow me to recover**. I even went through the process of **trying to get admitted to a psychiatric facility** as I have had several times in the past few months where I came extremely close to performing my suicide plan, where **I was turned away due to COVID**. I'm also anxious about telling (and completely disappointing) my parents as my sister also has mental health issues and is currently not in the best state of mind.

I think that I need to tell my parents before I take action as they may react differently to my expectations, but the real problem for me is that it's becoming extremely difficult to stop myself from making an attempt as **I'm just existing for other people and the likelihood that things can get better is very low**. I'm just sick of not feeling like a person anymore and have longed for death over the past 9 months. **How can I find a reason to live for myself when I have nothing positive in my past, present and future, and tend to dismiss anything potentially positive in the future.**

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;Dr: I royally screwed up when I'm already the disappointment of the family and need a reason to live  when I'm nihilistic, not having anything positive in my future and don't feel like a person after keeping myself alive for my parents mostly",11Sep2020,1

I'm writing it for myself and writing it for anyone who needs to hear this right now.  
The world is better with you in it, and you have made it this far, you can keep going.

We are all affected by suicide, some people more closely than others.  Whether it was a family member, you personally struggled with suicidal thoughts, survived suicide attempts, had a friend or maybe had one of your favorite celebrities commit suicide, if you are reading this post you're still here &amp; so am I.

My family has been deeply affected by suicide, and mental wellness, and I personally struggled with depression from a very young age. For those who knew me from a young age I had camp friends who just called me ""emo"" and had many classmates who saw me sleep in class, or even through a fire drill. No, not all pre-teens or teenagers who sleep in class or are very emotional have mental health issues but many go untreated and it can often be hard to spot. Around 80% of cases start in adolescence. There is still a heavy stigma for talking about this topic, even within me. 

One of my classmates reported me to the school counselor. Luckily the school was well funded and small enough that the school counselor followed up with my family and I was linked with counseling and antidepressant medications that helped make things bearable, but it was not easy. I almost failed out of high school and again an education psychologist helped me get through it along with all my supports, my family did their best to understand and be supportive but it is not easy at all. I had my issues in college, I even witnessed a friend attempt to commit suicide freshman year. But good friends, psychedelics and live music really helped me break out of my shell and learn to actually love my life. I stopped counseling and antidepressants and graduated, started working as a counselor myself and continued to love live music, found spirituality, yoga, a serious meditation practice, rituals, authentic relationships. 

Working with serious mental illness, a population that is likely to die 10–20 years earlier than the general population, you expect that some of your clients will die,. And one day they did, I returned to go to see a therapist myself soon after finding one of my clients a very kind and gentle musician in his bed dead from a suicide. 

For another year or two I was  going to counseling, live music shows, yoga,  meditating, doing things I loved and I was hit with another wave of major depression which catalyzed me go back on medication and to demote myself from a position at work to ease some stress from my life. I've had friends die from suicide, several died from overdoses just in the last two years. Let's not beet around the bush here, suicide surrounds us, there have been entire books dedicated to the topic,  this pandemic/political turmoil/racial uprising has really not helped in people's mental wellness and we still won't talk about it.  We have gone through collective traumas this year, at the same time as we are all grieving the perceived future we thought we would have without a pandemic.

Finding a friend to confide in, getting connected to a therapist, relying on spirituality or religion, using medications, all of these safety nets that we can use to help those who struggle with their mental wellness. i specifically use mental wellness because I want you to be introduced to [\#NeuroDiversity](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/neurodiversity?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZVhWKmLNgbj4-3qX3rpO4CjB7ANSTvV6r351tSzHatz56ZXMastsl1_znX43IRbBD8BaCL4OMlYUCYsST4JY59KXx2OLgXezdNd9qSQIXhq7hVkg0mf2grWwiB1Usdk9fo&amp;__tn__=*NK-R). Yes I do believe that those major depressive episodes are illnesses just like cancer, diabetes or other unavoidable diseases but that does not make me Avishai, a major depressive. I am different than a lot of folks and diversity is pretty damn amazing when it's welcomed and accepted. Do I have some limitations? sure, who doesn't? But it does not define me, and it does not define you. That is why I write this story, because I know I didn't always feel this way, I know I wasn't always this comfortable to  be vulnerable. Some may think this is over sharing, I say, this post is not for you and I respectfully disagree, people don't like talking about uncomfortable topics and a lot of it is inherited stigma that stays around in our subconscious. 

This post is for all those who may have struggled with mental health issues in the past or currently,  
it's for all of those who are working in the mental health/substance use field to remember that your work matters because I truly don't know if I would be around to write this write now if it wasn't for my supports.   
This post is for all the individuals who may be holding it together right now and may be afraid or avoiding to ask for another safety net because of stigma.

It is not weakness to be in therapy,   
It is not weakness to be on medications,    
It is not weakness to breakdown sometimes and actually feel your feelings.  We are still collectively grieving a future, a present with a global pandemic right now and some of y'all haven't left the first stage of denial whether you are aware of it or not.

I'm currently in my final year getting my master's in mental health counseling, working with counselors to help those with serious mental illness and substance use disorders, I have the best grades I've ever had in my life and scholarships to boot, and I'm starting to find ways to innovate the mental health industry, reduce the stigma for mental health and substance use, advocate for harm reduction and have fun while doing it. I still get depressive episodes, several every year to be honest, and the traumatic experiences have only grown over the years but I am more resilient than ever before and I have dedicated my life to healing, found more passions than I can fill in a week, and really lived a life that I love and am grateful to be alive. 

If you need help finding a therapist you can start on websites like psychologytoday, talk to your primary care physician or call your insurance provider for a list of mental health resources or find your local mental health association, friends who are looking for therapists of color theramatch on instagram can be a useful resource. Unfortunately this process is not as good as it should be but that leaves room for improvement

If you want to support your friends who are struggling consider taking a mental health first aid training, reach out to that friend you haven't talked to in a while and go on a walk, have dinner together, call them on the phone, make an effort, it can mean the world to someone.

I'll leave you with a quote and a poem, thanks for reading.

Life doesn't get easier we just get stronger and more resilient. - Steve Marboli, 

""This being human is a guest house.  
Every morning a new arrival.

A joy, a depression, a meanness,  
some momentary awareness comes  
as an unexpected visitor.

Welcome and entertain them all!  
Even if they’re a crowd of sorrows,  
who violently sweep your house  
empty of its furniture,  
still, treat each guest honorably.  
He may be clearing you out  
for some new delight.

The dark thought, the shame, the malice,  
meet them at the door laughing,  
and invite them in.

Be grateful for whoever comes,  
because each has been sent  
as a guide from beyond.""

Jalaluddin Rumi

72,"Ill write my story down here, its somewhat long, and im sorry about that.

I desided to post here again after i got some response on an other post.

In advance im sorry for grammar mistakes and such.. 

My story i actually believe starts when i was
only 3 years old. (1996)I was to have a little
brother, unfortunately he died before he
was born. This has left a scar somehow.
The year after I got a little sister. And ever since I've felt that I live in her shadow. Ive, even noticed my parents treating us differently in situations where we should be treated the same. 
In 1998 my father got really ill, he gradually
lost his vision on first one eye, then it came
back, then the other eye. But his vision
came back. Then is feet and fingers
become numb. In 1999 he got the
diagnosis Multiple Sclerosis (MS). He has
been lucky he worked for almost 20years
100% even tho the doctors said maximum
5 years.
In 1999/2000 i started school, the few
things i remember from those first 7 years
is fear of being bullied, because that
started within the first months at school.
It would probably not seem like bullying for
people outside, but it hurt. I can't quite
remember what was said or done. But my
doubts in myself grew. When i started
Junior High School, i was that metalhead
(yes i love metal always has). And id built
up a wall of self defense. My defense was
to say or act like this or that. Often it
resulted on that my words was used
against me and made me a bigger target. 
I have to say that from 4th grade i had one
good friend. We would always hang
around together.
High School came, i went on to be an
electrician. And my problems grew, by this
time i had a girlfriend with history of
depression, and anorexia etc. I was so in
love.. Obviously she was not. The teasing
or bullying never left me at school.. If
followed to High School, even though it
there were new people all around.
Suddenly at my last year of High School i
got a message on skype or MSN or what
we used back then, that my girlfriend had
cheated on me with a friend of hers at her
school.. At her school... At that point you
could've just chopped of my head and and
left me there..
I went down.. Really deep, suicide was
something that tempted me so much, and
self harm was an activity i frequently did..
While trying to recover from her, i
discovered that she had manipulated me
for 2 years... Before we were even a
couple.. It just made it worse..
Skip forward, i have a job and no longer
harm myself. But i feel insecure at work
because those words i say due to my
defense is still used against me. And i
would probably had done the same myself,
but all those small droplets over time fills
the glass.
In 2011 i got a new girlfriend.. Short time
after the betrayal actually. But this girl! She
was different! Is different. We went on to
move together, and everything was
actually pretty good. First time i
experienced something i now would call
social anxiety, was when we was
supposed to go to a birthday party with a
friend of my girlfriend.. I got so nervous
and sick the day before.. And when my
girlfriend left for the party.. I suddenly
became just fine. There are several times
this has happened after that. There are several times this has happened after that.
In 2015 we expected our daughter, and
bought a house. When she came my life
just flipped upside down. The emotions
was overwhelming. I felt everything at
once. And actually i felt this could be my
solution, that with a child being outside
with other people would be easier. Couldn't
be more wrong. The story from here is hard to put together to be honest because it has happened so fast.
I was to pick our daughter up from
kindergarten, and when i drove into the
parking lot i saw the parking lot was full
(something it only is when there is an
event). I didn't know of an event and called
my girlfriend, no answer.. I became dizzy,
blurred vision, and sic... I backed out and
waited for my girlfriend. My first panic
attack. Until this time my gf knew there
was something, and i did to, but i didn't
know it was anything to worry about to be honest.
Days and weeks went, and one day i came
home and was to cook dinner. Then my gf
called and said she would be a little late,
some shopping after picking up our
daughter. I said ok and we hung up.. I
flipped... I got so furious, i have no idea
what happened by i guess my mind was
full of emotions and that was the final
push.. I threw my phone into the wall and it
went everywhere at once.. I even took a
fork and stabbed my wrist watch... I sunk
onto the floor and cried like a child for half
an hour at a minimum.. When my gf came
home she actually understood what had
happened..!! God how i love her!
Shortly after i got an appointment at the
psychologist. It had to be a private one
because my mom works as a secretary st
the public one. My parent have NO idea
about who i am.
We had some sessions but i couldn't quite
open up i guess, so we decided it was
nothing more he could do, and he was probably right, after all i didn't give him my
full story.
Things being this hard, i mean.. Go to the
store is a whole day's work.. Of we go to a
shopping mall or something, i'm so
exhausted when we come home i need to
sleep.
I hate it! I hate how i am!
The worst thing is that i haven't been to any
gatherings at my daughters kindergarten..
It breaks my heart to even think about it.
A couple of weeks ago i got really sad
once again.. So many years after.. I was
rapidly thinking of suicide and such... I
haven't told anyone.
I often feel like i need to cry, i need to get
something out. But i can't..
In 2014.. I forgot to tell... The friend i've had
since 4th grade just stopped contacting
me or responding and we just haven't seen
or talked to each other since.. It was hard..
Now i'm just kind of pissed about it. My parents are of those who judge... I
haven't told them about myself, because i
feel they will judge me as they judge
people they don't know.
I don't know what more to write.. I'm sure
there is more, but this is what comes to
mind at this point.

What I need is some kind of support i guess, I feel stuck... And about to collapse as i wrote in my previous post..

I don't know what im asking for, because i don't know what i need.",11Sep2020,1
73,"Lately I’ve almost been feeling like somebody else is doing the talking, walking, and everything else for me. Sometimes I don’t like the way that I act, and i’m conscious of it, however i continue to act that way, almost like I’m not fully there, but instead in my head.

Thinking just doesn’t feel the same as it used to. In the last couple of years it’s felt like my train of thought has become far more abstract. Which makes it hard to focus on things like schoolwork when I’m focused on the inner workings of the universe itself, even if i’ll never understand what the fuck i’m even thinking about. 

My thoughts sometimes feel as if they’re multidimensional. But there are absolutely no words to describe the actual feeling. Multidimensional is the best that I can think of. Multidimensional incomprehensible thoughts that I almost have a grasp on, yet couldn’t put into words if my life depended on it. So, when thinking these completely abstract thoughts I feel like I understand them yet have no idea what they mean, because these thoughts are not words. 

If anybody has even the smallest clue as to what’s going on or what this is called, please, let me know.",11Sep2020,1
74,"I am a 24-year-old male on my fifth week of psychotherapy in the SoCal region. I got lucky and found an awesome out of network psychotherapist who has a lot in common with me. I don’t know how common it is, but the first two weeks were like this honeymoon phase. What I mean by that is that I have this weight lifted off my shoulders like I didn’t have to go through this alone and had a professional show me how to cope with my anxiety rumination and control issues. however I missed a week and I went on this downward spiral where I felt like nothing had any help and I can only compare it to the week after doing Molly. A few sessions later I asked him if there was a name for what I had and he said that, and I quote, “oh you’re definitely depressed”.

Long story short she told me that I should call the behavioral hotline from Kaiser and that they could get me set up with an evaluation in antidepressants within a week or two. However I’ve been too anxious to pick up the phone because I often stammer and feel like I’m frustrating the person on the other line. The kicker is the I too work in healthcare and I have been on the other side of this absolutely frustrated with a patient who can’t seem to get the fucking story out. I would also like to get evaluated for other things like my suspicion that I may have ADHD.

Is there a quick summary or crash course of what to expect when I call them it would really ease my nerves and I would greatly appreciate it because I’m kind of at the end of my rope here, not literally we’re trying to avoid that LOL.",11Sep2020,1
75,"A week or two before the pandemic I had a spiritual breakthrough that made me feel a new person. Before that I was depressed, since I was a kid. No real reason, it’s just the way I was borned. 

I’m 20 years old and I think I never felt so consciously in peace and happy about life like I was from march to august. fuck, it felt like a whole chapter of my life and it lasted nothing. However, it was the first time I REALLY felt good, without “distractions” like a new boyfriend, etc. Just me living life. 

But reality hitted me now. I dropped out college only for this year bc it was hard to concentrate  in online classes. I live with my sixty something parents and they are REALLY, REALLY taking care of themselves. My dad works from home so nobody gets out of the house, LITERALLY. Groceries are delivered home. My older siblings come visit only from outside of the house. 

I had gone out for 3 walks alone around the block since march, and two visits to the doctor. Those were the only time I crossed the door of my house. 

Recently my parents calmed a little down so honestly I could’ve gone for more walks than those. But 1) I’ve become paranoid and am scared of making them ill, so I end up coming back tense instead of fresh and 2) what is the point of surviving if I can’t live and wont be able to live for years?.

I know this is a global pandemic and all you are going through it, which is obviously worst, now I REALLY dont have a choice, now it isnt just me.

I dont have a hobbie, I don’t like my career or any career. I have spent all this months lying on my bed with my phone and drinking. Honestly all my life.

I stopped even asking the universe for a partner bc what’s the point if I won’t leave my house for years. 

How are you surviving this? How can you find a reason to keep going if life will be like this for years? I’m scared, one of the things that kept me from killing myself before was that I had a bit of hope. But now there is none, because the problem is not only me, there is nowhere to escape.",11Sep2020,1

79,"I am 25 M.I am from India. We have close knitted relationships and families here. I live in a joint family. When i was ten years old and my brother was 19, I discovered he was having an affair with my uncle's( my father's brother) wife. There was a big fight. Living was hell during that time. But time passed and things got better. I still had respect for my brother. When i was in college, i lived one year with my brother.  He was 32 then. Then somehow i came to know he was having a secret affair with an 18 year old girl who is also a family relative. If her family or my family came to know about all this,again there would have been fights and all that shit. I have seen my brother hitting on 18 year old girls in our family. My mother knows about all this but never once discussed these things with my brother(maybe because extramarital affairs,sex and similar things are considered a big taboo in india.) If my father came to knew about all this he would be heartbroken ,it would take physical toll on him and my brother would face consequences. It would tear the family apart.
I hate my brother now due to all this and i just can't even stand his name. I get very upset when someone even talks about him.  I have serious trust issues and i am afraid to form new relationships. I am afraid he could take advantage of my close ones also like this. (I also have mild migraine diagnosed by doctor when I was 18).

80,"Yesterday was my birthday, and I celebrated it alone, which was sort of alright with me. I was looking forward to having a me day and doing stuff I really liked, but when morning came, only my family and one other friend had texted/called me. Since it was a working day, I thought, no big deal, maybe they will text me later, but until I put up a whatsapp status of a digital card my little brother made me in the late afternoon, no one messaged me. I'm kind of ashamed to say that I overreacted and was crying the entire day, and ruined it. In my mind, remembering birthdays and making someone feel special is an act of affection, and I always do something special for them, even when I am busy. I even bake cakes for my closest friends. I wasn't expecting anything big, but I thought they would at least wish me. 

Later when they called to apologize about forgetting and to wish me, I ignored their calls for a long time. Finally I talked to one of my friends that night and explained why I was upset. She apologized over and over, and said that to her, a birthday wasn't that big a thing, since we are all in our mid twenties. After the call, she made a little video for my birthday.

It may sounds stupid 

Since I was born, if I  recall every memory where I was learning something for school or for just hobby, all I do in my as if I taught somebody in my head. For example recently I read something about jets. Actually I can not learn because all I do is  ""impressing myself by telling to a person (usually somebody around my relatives or friends) how cool am I by knowing this fact"" what I  am reading right now. 

As if I taught somebody while I want to learn, but by doing this I can not notice anything because I just ""live up"" the moment in my head how cool am I since I know this fact and telling him.   


I was a top student in school but I  know myself that's how I studied all the time. But in such cases, I imagined teachers and telling them how good boy I am because I know the subject they gave me. 

Just a side note, I was a top student, participating in many competitions in geography, history, langauges. However, I am terrible at maths, physics, chemistry. Sometimes I cannot even add up numbers in my head like 27+34. 

When I was 17 years old, I decided to learn Russian (my native is Hungarian by the way) during the summer time holiday, I managed to reach a decent average level but as I remember I studied by the way I mentioned above. 

Currently, it really bothers me because at least when I was younger I managed to actually learn something even if I was teaching somebody. However, now, I can learn nothing,  only for 10 minutes since this ""event"" in my head is being played out.",11Sep2020,1
86,"I fell in love with a girl few years ago and we were together for a while, then things couldn't go on anymore for several reasons.

I thought of her every day since. I still love her as madly as ever. But I'm not that suicidal anymore so I thought maybe it's ok to check on her just to see her beautiful face after a very difficult year of not opening her Facebook or Instagram etc.

Last night at 3 am I opened her instagram and found out she didn't post anything in a year. And I knew exactly what that meant.
I opened Facebook and saw that I was right. And I can't stop weeping since.
My heart is hurting like it never did before.
I don't know what to do.

So a few weeks ago i mentioned to my dad that i think i May have ADHD.

But i never meant it in saying yes i do have ADHD just to be clear. 

Anyways i brought it up to him and he just said that you could look up any symptom and Can probably relate to it. Although it was only a though it felt so invalidating. I know i have some other sort of mental illness prob again depression or anxiety so hearing that just made me think that i couldn’t talk to him about it. Or that he wouldn’t believe me.

**Important**

I'm gonna start off by saying i think you should 100% read the TL;DR if you want to understand the story fully there's a few extra things in there i didn't know how to fit in without jumping from one place to another. :) I'm not the best at explaining things but i tried my best sorry if it comes off rude i don't want to be rude i just need to be straight to the point. I'm happy to explain more in comments if anyone wants to ask me anything i'd love to answer.

**Whole Story**

I've started smoking weed recently a lot and i feel as if it's not made me paranoid like everyone's going to assume but opened my mind more to make me realize things from other peoples perspective. If people are going to say it's made me paranoid and weed is the reason i'm writing this then please refrain from commenting. I do not have time for people blaming a plant on MY mental health issues maybe some but not mine, the actions that have caused me to realize this have been happening for my entire life i just never saw them as a bad thing as it was happening from my parents and i just thought they cared about me most and wanted the best for me. I've realized my parents have been ""belittling"" me my whole life i only came to this realization today when i told my Nan i was buying some decorations for my room, my favorite band posters, ceiling hangs (tapestry's) and some lights for my room as i'm sick of these boring blue walls now and decided it was easier and cheaper to cover them up that way. When i originally told her this she was completely fine and acted like this was something any 20 year old would do, but this morning when i went down into the kitchen and my aunt was there. I mentioned something about the order coming today to my Nan and my aunt asked what i was doing. My Nan started to explain for me that i was buying pictures and big cloth sheets to hang over my ceiling laughing whilst saying it but not laughing in a good way like kind off laughing like she thought it was stupid. I've lived with my Nan for 9+ years now i know when she's laughing at something being stupid and laughing when she thinks somethings generally funny. I immediately realized in the moment that this didn't make me feel good. When she started to walk out the room she said to me ""don't you think that's a little bit of a 16 year old thing to do? have pictures all over their walls?"" i ignored her and walked out. I truthfully wanted to do it because my girlfriend recently moved into her college dorm and did the same thing and i thought it was cool. I've been expressing a lot recently to her that I've been feeling belittled by her and my mother A LOT but never brought it to attention because it was just my normal i guess. I love my mum and i love my Nan i would never ever do anything to hurt them or their feelings and they say the same things back to me but i feel like they say a lot but don't act on it. I would just like to get other peoples opinions on this i'm not sure if i'm being too sensitive or this is actually belittling. 

TL;DR My mum and Grandmother are insensitive to me and nobody else and treat me like i know nothing and that everything i say or want to do is pathetic. They laugh at the things i am passionate about or the things i want to do to make myself happy. They always say they aren't laughing in a bad way but it makes me feel bad? I've been talking to my Nan and mum about how it makes me feel recently but as soon as i tell my Nan that includes her she gets offended and starts telling me i'm too sensitive and that all she tries to do is nice things. I always question whether the things i say are even true when i'm expressing how i feel i don't know how to even explain this, it's like i can argue with someone for 3 hours about my mental health and how the things they do are effecting me negatively but then at the end of it they make me question if i'm just unloading lies onto them to make them feel bad. I don't know if they are doing this on purpose or it's just because i actually am being a bad person.

92,"Just figured out recently that I don't really have a real bond with anyone. The people I used to think are the closest to me, aren't really. I mean they talk to me for good content and advice and getting compliments and validation from me but nobody really hears me out. In spite of being an introvert, I've tried telling some people that I'm not having a good time and I feel alone. Everyone just seems to ignore it without talking. I know it can be a burden for them to support someone so I don't really blame them for being selfish but after avoiding me when I'm asking for help or just their company, they come back again demanding for stuff, good tutorial videos, cheapest places to buy things, best free resources online, and I'm tired of it. I really am. I don't think I'll be able to carry this on any more so I just removed myself from all other social media. But the thing is, if I don't engage with people, is it really possible to stay happy all alone all the time? I really don't want to be a burden on others or on myself anymore. I don't mind dying either honestly.",11Sep2020,1
93,Not really a good title but I wasn’t sure what else to put. I’m 20 and have been struggling with my mental health for about a year now. The thing is I don’t have good insurance nor do I drive. Having terrible insurance makes it really difficult for me to find a therapist and they’re usually not in an accessible distance for me. I also work a minimum wage job and go to school so it’s been hard to find the time. I know these may all sound like excuses but I can feel my mental health deteriorating and I’m not sure what to do or what my options are. I don’t have a lot of friends to ask for help and I wasn’t sure where else to ask for help.,11Sep2020,1
94,"So this is my first reddit post. And I thought I'll share it on a page which focuses on mental health to share with people what I think so maybe, others can relate to it and gain some insight. 

Social Media has been a boon and a curse to the Gen Z generation. We all know the pros of it, hear about them everywhere and love and share them. 

The cons? We know them, feel them, sometimes talk about them but do nothing to control them or rectify them. 

Social Media has a huge ill effect on the biological wiring of us humans beings. We human beings since the dawn of time have gathered food, hunt, compete for mate and provide protection to our loved ones. And it was all working in balance until the AI enforced social media entered our lives. 

This generation, as we know under the term, has been according to many studies called as the most depression prone one with a huge rising population suffering from it than it has ever before. 

We are wired for competition for mates, to provide better life for our family. But now since social media rules a majority of our daily lives with its unrestricted access for hours and hours by us individuals, we have started showing our biological competition on this platform too. 

For example, we use Instagram, watch people do things we wanna do, or places we wanna visit but we aren't able to, and the fact that we aren't able to do the same thing makes us feel bad and fuels our need to fight and work for being better than others, adding more and more pressure on our mental health. 
 
In the same relative context, if the social media didn't affect our lives that much, doesn't mean we still wouldn't wanna do those things. We would want to do new stuff, visit new places, but the pressure and greed for it won't be as much as it is when fueled by the social media. And hence the pressure would be much lesser, the goal always there but the efforts made by us much kinder to our well being. 

Same about mental health relating to our love life? 
Well, these days, the competition for potential mate searching is so disrupted by the social media. Even for search or potential partners, we have separate platforms like Tinder etc. They have their own pros of meeting new people and getting to know others, but we can't forget the flip side of that coin. The competition to look better, get more matches and have a hot and interesting profile already takes such a toll on so many in the effort to create an ""attractive"" profile. And since we try to create this perfect persona of what we look like, we attract audience and accordingly potential ""mates"" who don't get to see the real you, which leads to heart breaks, meaningless relationships and once again, detoriating mental health. 

See, we humans haven't got the evolutionary time to develop our psychological behaviour in such way to tolerate such tremendous competition which is difficult to keep up with this social media influence which is growing like wildfire. And cause of this, our mind isn't able to handle it, causing depression and anxiety in so many people. 

So many of us now rely on the things we see on our screens instead of taking time to actually know the reality. And I think it's time to reconsider all of this for the benefit of ourselves. 

Just wanted to share my perspective, would love to hear opinions of others too.",11Sep2020,1

Recently stopped Lexapro for depression (was on it for 4 years, did nothing) and Lamotrogine (started this year, gained 30 kgs in two months on Lamotrogine, stopped it, still havent lost any of the weight). Quit meth one month ago FOR GOOD... struggled for years on that crap, never doing it again... That I swear by. I have had my ups and downs on that awful narc, I am now no longer craving it... at all. Quit weed three months ago. That was an easy one, never liked it much. Thing is, I was craving meth when I saw my Psych two months back... and was stating I needed something to help me get off it. And for the lack of motivation. I still experience the lack of motivation (suffer from sever PTSD and General Anxiety Disorder, have since I was quite young). Now I am off meth, and no longer craving it... I hope it is still a drug I should be taking? My Doc is aware of all of this. He seems very keen to up my dosage quickly to 200mg... Am concerned. I also drink nightly, &lt;9 standard drinks per night. That is the next habit to tackle. Please no judgements, I would really appreciate some advice and help! Thanks.",11Sep2020,1
100,"Info: I (17f) grew up in a super abusive and extremely religious household with a Dad who did not believe in mental illness. I always had issues making friends, socializing, making eye contact, and sensory issues. I also had a lot of problems with change and would often fall into a depression when a lot of things changed at once. My Mom suspected I had Aspergers, my Dad didn’t let her go take me somewhere to get tested therefore I continued to be my socially awkward and extremely anxious self. When I was like 9 I started getting unwanted and really scary thoughts and fears that I could not shake no matter what. I also started picking up strange habits and tics which concerned my Mom greatly, but again she was not allowed to get me help. 

When I was 12 she finally took my sisters and I and left my Dad and when I was 15 we finally found a child psychiatrist who accepted our insurance and I started seeing her. She said I showed signs of Aspergers &amp; OCD but then said nothing more. 

I’m 17 now and I’m really getting annoyed. I know I’ve got something wrong with me and I want whatever it is to be treated so I can be somewhat normal. Any advice on how I should ask her to test me for Aspergers &amp; OCD?",11Sep2020,1
101,"Until this summer I was very happy in the relationship I was in. We had been together since january 2019, and moved in together january 2020. I thought everything was fine. We had a gaming room, and a lot of plans about how to fix up the apartment.

Then Come july 2020... Me and my best friend decided to take a roadtrip around the country, and it was great. The same night I arrived home he was waiting for me in our livingroom. He told me he had moved out. His stuff was still there and he wanted to make a relationship with me work, but due to his own issues he didn't want to live in that apartment anymore. This broke my heart, but if course if that was how he felt I couldn't do much about it.

A few Weeks passed and before I knew it he was basically ignoring me. I asked him to Come back to our place so we could talk after I finished work that day. When he came I told him that I really wanted to work our situation out, but he would have to put in a bit more effort. What he said next will probably always haunt me. He said that fighting for a relationship with me was not worth it. He didn't feel the same anymore. He thought his previous feelings for me had Come from a place of self loathing.

Forward to last night. His stuff is still in my apartment and when he left it looked like a mess. I have cleaned the apartment, paid for everything, packed away some of his stuff, washed the clothes he had left there as well as dried and folded them. Last night I packed away some of his childhood pictures and I am so worn out. I've been working full time on the side and he won't even let me know when he's coming to pick up his stuff.

I don't know what I want out of this post, but I felt the need to get this off my chest. The last month has been so bad for me. The feeling he left me with is like a dagger in my back that twists everytime I think about it. I don't know how to cope with my feelings. I Just want to be okay..",11Sep2020,1

I'm terrified for him, I feel that it's all my fault. I don't feel like I deserve things like water, food or sleep because of this. If I can't provide him with that right now then I have no right to give it to myself. I honestly feel like I just want to die, I really hate myself for this. So, so much.

I have been going through a real down slump with manic highs and lows since narrowly surviving suicide in February. It's honestly a miracle I wasn't at least left with brain damage. 

After a period of 6 or 7 weeks of really struggling, yesterday I put together my short synopsis and sent my work to 5 literary agents as a first run.

The hope that I can share my writing with people the world over and perhaps let some light in the dark rooms of those of us who suffer.

What happened was that I made a mistake of leaving my phone at my house that I was hosting the woman and her family, and she went through it. I’m currently going through a non toxic divorce with my ex wife, we divorced due to just not being able to reconcile and it was a mutual decision. My ex wife and I talk once in a while mostly about the divorce or other obligations, and I had found our old wedding album while cleaning my house to host the family. I ended up sending pictures of my the wedding album to my ex, in which she responded “ew I needed braces” and I responded “I always liked your smile” and that she said she looked ugly in another and I said “you looked pretty”... I swear I didn’t mean anything by it, I wasn’t trying to get my ex back.. but this girl read it. The girl then refused to talk to me the rest of the weekend, she deleted her contact off my phone, and refused to tell me what the problem was although I suspected she went through my phone. Before she left, she was still acting up, I asked her what was wrong and she responded “YOU CHEATED” in front of her whole family and when I said “no I didn’t” she took it as I’m trying to make her into a liar in front of her family, her mother started crying, asking me how I could do such a thing before even listening to what I had to say, I was traumatized.She drove back to her city and refused to talk to me, and relayed to my friend that it was over. I’ve talked to her a few times since on the phone but she is still sticking to her guns about me cheating, saying I shouldn’t have complimented my ex. Just like that I lost the woman, I could spend 13 hours on the phone with.

She wants nothing to do with me, I busted my ass for this woman, I did everything I could to make her happy, but all of that went to waste. She refuses to even give me a chance to be in her life. I’ve heard through the grapevine that if she feels disrespected she cuts people off, I understand what I did was not cool in a relationship, but I didn’t mean to come off as I wanted my ex back.

Ideas come to me, things I should do or might like to do but then the motivation just gets ripped out from under me. Everything feels pointless. Everything else feels like too much pressure. Sometimes I have an idea, get up and then forget what it was, and sit back down. Sometimes I head towards the thing I was going to do, then look at it and feel unwell at the idea. 

I get stuck in this cycle where I just sit or lie there doing nothing and feeling sick to my stomach with guilt and anxiety about it, but totally unable to do anything. Even eating feels like too much to ask sometimes. Even when I'm so hungry my stomach hurts. My brain just has an answer for everything as to why I shouldn't bother.

117,"CW: Mention of suicide 

For a bit of background, my mental health had been improving in the last couple of years. I started going to therapy too. I had been feeling numb but fine y’know. No suicidal thoughts, I even had been planning a bit of a future for myself.

But everything has come crashing down recently and I don’t know why. I feel depressed all the time, I sleep a lot but I’m tired all the time, don’t have much appetite, I’m ill, have thoughts of harming or killing myself, etc. All that good stuff. It seems I’ve gone a step back.

I’ve gone back to school which means, of course, more stress.

I’ve also lost my support system, I don’t have friends to talk to, my therapist... well I’ll start lying to her today and my parents have been dismissive.

I feel so alone and I don’t know what to do again, I’m back, and I’m scared. I don’t know how much more I’ll fall, if I’ll start self harming again, if I’ll lose myself again. I’ve already been pushing people away. Yesterday I planned what I was gonna do and say to everyone. I was thinking when it would be appropriate to relapse

My only choice right now is to pretend for everyone else, keep working, keep smiling and see if this is temporary or another 3 years gone.

It’s almost like as soon as I realise I’m too happy or laughing a lot or having fun, it hits me that I shouldn’t be happy, or that I’m not allowed to be happy, or I’ll remember all the reasons to not be happy all at once, or I’ll catch a glimpse of my face and feel horrified/ugly, or sometimes I’ll even just... forget how?

120,"I've been thinking about this for a while now. I recently got myself into a very VERY destructive cycle where I started drinking excessively, smoking again, having meaningless sex and repeat. It's horrible and I feel horrible every morning I wake up hungover, wanting to vomit and cry at the same time. 

I started this cycle years ago when I was around 13-14, even if it's not drinking or smoking, it's always something self-destructive like starving myself, binging, over working. I've forgotten life without that high from doing horrible things to my health. I can't even have sex without being blacked out drunk. 

The thing is I'm still very functional, I'm getting relatively high grades doing pre-med. I seem fine, but I just can't function properly without rewarding myself with a whole bottle of whiskey that night. 

I do want to be better now. I'm turning 19 in a few days. No one is responsible for my health anymore. However, every time I get determined to make a change like this, my thoughts always try to shut me down.

124,"Long story short, my parents were fairly strict and ""coddling"" despite I liked independence. As a toddler I was a bit of a ""momma's boy"" but around 7-8 years old, I started to move from that and broke out of it. But, the helicoptering of my parents still was around. I wasn't able to have a sleepover with my best friends until I was 16. I couldn't stay home by myself until I was 15. I was never able to leave the house to simply go on a walk by myself, unless I was with someone else. While living at home during college, whenever I left the house to go to school, work, etc, I had to text them when I was leaving, when I arrived, when I was leaving that destination, and when I got home. Every time. I moved out when I was 25, and had to do it up until the day I moved.


I don't live at home anymore (haven't for four years) and while I love my family and do miss them, I absolutely love living on my own and with my fiancée across a state border. The independence is unreal and while their ""grip"" has obviously relaxed, I wouldn't trade this life I'm currently living for anything. I can do what I want, when I want, and it's wonderful. Got my own little world here with us two, and I've been doing things I haven't been able to do, and experiencing things I never did. It's awesome 


That said, I feel like I missed out on stuff in my youth, and get nostalgic for things I didn't even experience. The example that sprung this post; I was watching the Netflix show, Stranger Things the other night, and got nostalgic with the kids going on their own to ride their bikes to their friends houses on their own. The idea of doing that was unheard of at my parents house, but was something I would have loved to do. I'm still best friends with my friends I mentioned above (have been for 22 of our 28 years) but we aren't in the same town now, and I felt like... nostalgic for those times I couldn't see them, in ways these kids on this fake show could. Like, going bike riding with friends? Unheard of in my adolescence. Yet I got nostalgic for it. 


Sounds really dumb, and I'm not even sure if 'nostalgic' is the right word, but it's the closest thing that comes to mind. But it's dumb, right? I mean, I have a car. I can and do whatever I want and that includes going to friends houses. But granted, adult lives get in the way of that and I haven't seen my friends in months unfortunately. So maybe I just am nostalgic for the carefree days of youth that I unfortunately was not allowed to experience in its fullest? Like I missed out on so many adventures and  sleepovers (like, I always had to lie to my friends and say I had a doctors appointment in the morning whenever I had to leave a sleepover, because I couldn't) 


Anyway, I'm just curious if anyone has experienced this sort of thing before. I'm probably being super over dramatic, because like I said, I love my life now and have all the freedom I could want, and do use it to its fullest. But still, it was just a  bizarre feeling I wanted to talk about which was really weird.",11Sep2020,1

Is it inappropriate for me to intervene and find someone for him? I'm really worried about him. I told his brother that he is welcome to come over and bring his autistic brother and stay with me.

127,"Very interesting, and good doc. I’m surprised how there’s not many post about this. I honestly feel like a piece of shit coming to reddit right after watching it hahah! I haven’t been on Facebook, twitter, or any other social media platforms for years and I think that is really beneficial to my over all mental health. I really feel like we are watching the dissolution of society, especially since I have been somewhat separated for awhile now. We are more polarized than ever, and we need to change. 

If you want to better your mental health, take a step back delete Facebook, Twitter, etc just for a week and see how it goes. At least turn off notifications. 

On the platforms I do use (basically just reddit and YouTube) I choose to only follow or subscribe only to comedy, science, etc.. things that don’t polarize and are only there for entertainment. Anything that gives you an opinion is dangerous.

So I’m 17 and autistic, I’ve had a fairly decent childhood, apart from where my brother is involved, he no longer lives with us so I’m safe, there’s no need for major concern, but in the past he’s been verbally abusive towards just about all of my family members, and earlier today my mum and him were in a heated argument about something I’d rather not post on here, she was telling him to get out the house and he was saying no, so flash forward a few hours and he’s been arrested for something he’s done to someone else the night before, then he’s released on bail and he came back here, the second I so much as heard his name I was shaking, and I don’t know why, I’m not scared of him, I’m not angry, I just shake. It’s not the first time I’ve shaken around confrontation either, this goes back a year or two. Every time I’m in an argument, or someone around me is in an argument I don’t know why I shake but I do, and that’s why I’m asking on here does anyone know what it is/could be? 
I got thinking but it just plays on my mind and since I’m no professional all I can come up with is maybe ptsd? Anxiety? I haven’t got a clue, like I said earlier, I’d like advice/ help from someone who’s gone through something similar or a mental health professional",11Sep2020,1

I thought my anxiety wasn't that bad at that time but recently, I've been feeling more anxious. My heart would start racing, my stomach would ache, and experience lack of appetite more often. The most concerning thing for me is I easily get disappointed and unhappy often ended up thinking people don't want to talk to me. It's because we can't meet people that we resorted to using instant messaging. Sometimes I feel like I am being purposely ignored. I didn't want to think about it because it alleviates my stress levels and I know it's dumb since not everyone has time to spare. Even midway writing this, I feel like I should just stop in fear of being ignored or called an attention seeker. I tried to deactivate my account once but I become even more anxious, what if there is something someone wants to tell me, what if someone wants to reach me. Those are the things I constantly think so i always have my phone and reply instantly whenever someone message me. I thought maybe I'm partly feeling this way because I don't get the same treatment I give to them.

I just keep of growing more and more afraid.

If anyone out there has been struggling with anxiety too, can you please tell me how are you able to cope?

136,"So I've been staying with this guy for a few months now and have noticed some strange things. He seems like a very nice guy, he is well educated and has a good job that he's kept for many years... so he is able to function in society but something is off that I can't put my finger on. Sometimes I'll pass by the living room to see him pacing around talking to himself while watching tv, it's not always audible but his facial expressions are as if he's having an intense conversation and sometimes he'll even laugh at/with himself. As soon as I talk to him he'll stop and it's like it wasn't happening. Sometimes we eat dinner together and if the conversation gets quiet, I'll look up to see him talking to himself (not out loud). Sometimes I'll ask him if he's ok, if anything is bothering him or if he has something to say and he's like ""oh no, I'm fine"" and smiles. I even told him one time he was talking to himself and he said no he wasn't. It's almost like he doesn't realize he's doing it. 

Another strange thing is when I first started staying here his room as a complete mess.  His bed was in the middle of his room and was surrounded by boxes and just... his junk... like there was just a path to his bed and the rest of the room looked like a bomb went off. I'll help him clean it but it ends up going back to the same. He loves old cartoons and has pictures of bugs bunny and other Disney drawings on his walls. He has a daughter who's full grown now but he keeps her finger paintings from when she was a toddler hanging on the walls as well. Sometimes he'll even talk to me in this baby voice ""would you like a dwink?"" He has a very hard time throwing old things away and he has told me that his brother has OCD and is a hoarder and I can't help but feel like he might also have some of that...

He's also socially... off or maybe awkward. He'll knock on the door when I'm in the bathroom and I'll say ""I'm in here!"" and he'll just walk right in so I have to be like um no! and he'll be like ""oh you're taking a dump sorry!"" Like wtf.... we went grocery shopping together one time and in the middle of an aisle with other people around he was like ""omg I can't believe you like that poo-pourie that my mom bought me!"" and I was just like.... uhhh what why would you say that right now &amp; so loudly? Just weird.

137,"I skirted the edge of the abyss for many years, feeling the pull of the dark, the screams of despair. Many times the sound drowned out everything else. A few times, a foot slipped, and I was sure that THIS time, I would fall in and get swallowed up by whatever demons set upon me. It was terrifying. Then came the cold, unfeeling nothing. Which was somehow worse. I got used to it, it became, not comfortable, but tolerable. I felt nothing other than anger and annoyance and irritation. Absolutely nothing. No one knew tho, cuz I’m smart, and I fooled them all. Behaving in such a manner as to convince them all that I was just like them. Sometimes, I’d even almost have a true, genuine feeling. Almost. So I became complacent. And just carried on existing. Then one day, it happened. My foot slipped. I fell. I fell so far...inches from the very bottom. I’m not sure what word conveys more than terrifying. Worse than being dead. At least if you’re dead, you don’t feel anything. It’s the ultimate NOTHING. My thoughts became tornados, violently swirling around, crashing into the locked steel boxes, threatening to unleash their long forgotten contents. My brain already processes so many thoughts, so quickly. With tangents shooting off exponentially in every direction. Down there? It was more than double. The thoughts were dark. The darkness enveloped me, as the thoughts screaming in my head became a symphony of torture. I wished I were dead. Just to have some peace. Just to make it STOP. Omg! There’s one box smashed to pieces. No thanks, I really don’t want to review the contents of that one. What’s that? Too bad? What about this one? Or this one? Etc. and so it went. And I just tried to stay away from the very bottom. I knew that would be the END. As much as I wanted it to stop, I did not want to give up. And then, I not only stayed off the bottom...I started to get traction. I began moving, ever so slowly upwards. I’m impatient. I tried to go faster. That just made me slip down again. I kept trying. I eventually got all the way to the top. But I couldn’t get quite all the way out. I kept trying (mostly-sometimes my foot would get caught, and I’d be pulled downward). Remember to breathe. Finally, one day it was just my toes dangling over the edge. And not far beyond the nothingness was life. I sat on the edge for quite awhile, reflecting. I realized that if I could fight my way back up from the depths of the abyss, confronting my demons, I could push through the nothingness. I did. Sometimes the abyss will open up in front of me, but the call of it has lessened. The most difficult thing to remember when in the dark, is that the dark WILL end.

Covid, living alone, not having any friends but one and working from home for a new company all hit me very hard and I wound up being escorted to the hospital for an evaluation by the police.  I never said I was going to hurt myself.  

It’s 5 months later and I feel just as shitty as April even with medication adjustment.  So I’m pretending I’m fine. Everyone thinks I’m ok because my eyes are clear and I’m eating again.

I'm just wondering how many of you end up experiencing isolation and abandonment from loved ones and the healthcare system at large

For context, I had an abusive childhood and am estranged from my family... as you might imagine, this combined with being autistic has not been a fantastic combo. I spent the last 2 years at a university where I could not make any friends and have been left on my own with all this trauma and anxiety. I recently got up the courage to reach out for help... I emailed more than 8 therapists in my local area to try and access treatment for all this, and reached out to some friends from school just to ask if they wanted to come and hang out with me

None of the therapists replied to my enquiry about accessing treatment despite me emailing each one multiple times (it's been over a week btw) except one who said she was fully booked, and as for my friends from home and just some company to combat the crippling social isolation well... both left me on read the first time I asked if they wanted to hang out, which hurt but I tried messaging again a couple of days later... and they did the same thing (not only this, but one literally read my message, posted a photo of themselves hanging out with another friend on their facebook, and left)

Ive been getting sadder and sadder more often this past year... but whats really made it unbearable these past few weeks is the isolation. Both my parents are almost sixty, and they arent letting me go to regular school because of covid. ""You could get covid any minute, theres so many people there, you cant go until this is over"". They wont even let me see friends anymore. I spend 22 hours a day in my room doing online classes, the other two just being spent in other rooms of the house. I cant even do my classes right. Its so confusing, I dont even know what my homework is, im so stressed out and overwhelmed. I miss people. I just want to go to school again, even if its just for one day. On top of that, my mom has been at my neck all quarantine. Shes been getting crazier and crazier about everything and her depression and anxiety has taken a turn for the worst. Lately shes been playing the victim card, saying how she should just move out since i dont like her anymore. One time she even stormed out of the house and drove away because I didnt listen to her when she told me to use paper towels to clean something up, and I used a regular one instead. 

I reread this, and its been what ive been thinking the past few months. I dont have a right to be sad. These are just insignificant problems. I dont have any abusive parents or going bankrupt because i couldnt pay my taxes. I dont have any problems. Why am I so self centered?

But I can't help but to think I'm inadequate, mainly because I just want my partner to be happy, and I've always had past rships saying that I was ""too busy"" for the rship and I have been cheated on many times. Given that I was also sexually inactive for the past few months, this just makes it worse because my mind races towards ""I'm not even sexually sufficient for my partner, hence partner isn't satisfied at all, partner is gonna find me boring/would want somebody else"" .

*Posting from phone, will do my best with the formatting

Since all the quarantine/self isolating/ working from home situation started I thought I was doing well. I had no issues to work from home in the same room as my partner and even we had so much fun during our working days. It makes the days easier and go faster.

This has changed however.

Due to extra time I had out of nowhere, I started to feel so guilty that I lost contacts with my friends. I moved abroad and have busy life until now. With some I haven't talked for years. So I contacted few of them which I was close to but not close enough to talk to them daily to catch up on life etc... Everything seems to go back to normal and I was happy, anxious free for while. I also keep reaching out friends since which I feel so happy about and planning to visit them once the pandemic ends. :) (I am one of the person who prefers person to person contact rather than online chat so I know I lost friends due to this as well).


After a while had thoughts about breaking up with my partner for no obvious reason. I just felt I don't deserve him and he would be happier without me. This last for about 2 weeks and then all came back to normal. 
I love my partner, we never had issue, never really argued or had any partner's troubles. 
It makes me feel so sad and guilty and even more anxious. Luckily I somehow overcome this and felt happy for a while again.

Recently I started feel down and anxious again. There was a time back at university when I felt in love madly with one guy. It's been now 8 - 7 years. (Thanks Facebook memories to remind me of this.) We met abroad where we both stayed as foreign students for 6 months/one year at university. We both knew, it wouldn't last longer than the time we both were there and I accepted that and was so happy for the time.  It felt like a break up when I left back home, even tho it wasn't really a break up and relationship as we didn't dated. 
I tried to stay it touches, even visited him and others mutual friends in their home country. I lost contact maybe 6 years ago when was the last time we chat. I think he deleted all his social media and I don't have his phone number, email or any other contact.
I met my current boyfriend 5 years ago and was happy since then and even I sometimes remembered the time while I was studying abroad and the guy, but always as s nice memories I had and was able to talk about him and all about the time I spend there without any issues. Until Now. He pops up in my thoughts more than I would like and I feel so guilty every time. My heart literally hurts every time I think about him. And I feel guilty also as it's feels to me like cheating on my boyfriend. And I don't want to feel that way.

I love my boyfriend, I don't know if I love him as much as I loved that guy, but I know I don't want to break up with my boyfriend or hurt him. I feel clueless and just waiting for this period of damn FB memories pass, which may take couple of months tho. 

Well, just wanted to get this out of my mind. Nobody form my friends knows about it, I opened just yesterday to one of my friend but I didn't tell her the whole story how I feel rn.

153,"hey guys :)

I've been struggling with mental health for quite a while now and 3 weeks ago I was admitted to a mental hospital again because I tried to kill myself. I've been there 2 times before.

well, the first time my diagnose was depression and anxiety and the second time depression with psychotic symptoms. now the doctors and my therapists think that it's something else. because now I actually began to tell them everything and not leave out so much like I did before. they thought about psychosis at first, but I don't have any hallucinations and don't really fit in a few other criterias, too. so that's not it. my therapist told me my case is really complicated and it's hard to find the right diagnose. 

and that's really frustrating me to be honest. I feel like it would help me so much to have a diagnose I can actually relate to. to have just a little sense of identity or something. I need something like that.

I'm afraid I'll never get the right diagnose, but I don't know if I can help in any way to get closer to finding it.

I just feel hopeless, in general. I feel like it's never going to get better and I'll just always end up in this dark hole again. I know I was extremely lucky to have survived my attempt, but sometimes I wish I hadn't. I just don't know.

156,"I (37f) was talking with a very good friend today, about what it was like for me being a teenager. And it got me thinking. 

I was a 'problem child'. For as long as I can remember, I've been told how difficult I was(am). I was a bitch. I was a bully. I was a liar. I was dramatic. I was too sensitive. I was annoying. I was a hypochondriac. And I was most of those things. I was also abused by a family member at a young age. 

I was also being bullied. I was being shamed at school nearly every day. I was ugly. I was too skinny. I was too fat. I was a nerd. I wasn't smart enough. It was embarassing to be my friend. I learned not to trust anyone with my secrets, but it didn't stop people from trying to weasel them out of me to use against me at a later date. I fell for it a few times before I caught on. I was desperate to be liked, and it made me a shitty friend. Ready to drop you the moment the cool kids snapped their fingers. I'd make up stories, dramatic and impossible ones and try to pass them off as truth. I was ridiculous. I can remember some of the yarns I would spin and I cringe. I'm so embarassed by my teenaged self. I have so much sympathy for her too. 

See, I was obviously mentally ill. my moods were all over the place, I was anxious all the time. I was so depressed. I was suicidal. I was being bullied at home by my step mother (long gone), and dad was not ready to see what she was doing to me. I had aquaphobia, and found it incredibly difficult to keep myself clean enough for people not to notice my fear of water. I was not always successful. Swimming carnival was my personal hell. I occasionally feel some resentment for the fact that my mental health issues were just passed of as me being a problem child. Too dramatic. Far too sensitive. I feel like if I had therapy as a teenager, I might have been able to sidestep some of the mistakes I made as a young adult, and even as a thirtysomething adult. I married the first man that showed any real interest in me, and stayed with him too long. I was such a bitch to him at times. I cringe. Sorry bout that. I'd make massive life changes at the drop of a hat (Still do that, apparently). I made some terrible financial decisions which are still haunting me. I was irresponsible with my health, bulemia. Had to be thin! Thinner! 

My teenaged self was an amorphous lump of clay, ready to mould myself into whatever you wanted me to be, as long as you stayed my friend. It was pathetic. And sad. I feel genuinely sad for her, but I also look at the personal growth I've had in the last 18 months, and the strides I've made in my mental health, and I'm proud. I have a few fantastic friendships. I have a wonderful life with Alice, my outside heart. I live in actual paradise. I have two of the most fantastic cats, who I adore. I'm more fiscally responsible. Alice's father is has been a surprising source of calm for me, and we are looking forward to seeing him soon. I am making my little unit a home for me and Alice, and actually looking forward to the future. No longer made of clay, but of steel.",11Sep2020,1
157,"I want to talk about something. I’ve had a hard time admitting it in the past because it doesn’t fit with the image of who I want to be and it makes me feel like an imposter because I’m a “successful” PhD student. I also have no idea what it means. But it does feel like a lot of what I experience isn’t explainable by anxiety and depression that I’ve been diagnosed with and treating. 

I struggle with a lot of things in secret. No one knows about them besides my partner since he lives with me. I’m so, so disorganized. I have a hugely hard time keeping the house clean and often my partner has to do most of it. I have extreme trouble with focus in almost all situations. I tend to space out in the middle of someone talking to me and completely miss what they say. I can spend entire class periods staring at the professor and absorbing absolutely nothing, or entire meetings where I couldn’t tell you at all what the discussion was about. I feel desire to focus on these things but it seems incredibly difficult for me compared to others. I can never remember details and I can only do well on tests if I cram the information into my brain right before and then I forget it as soon as I’ve taken the test. 

I have a very hard time with long term goals and anything that requires me working towards a goal for longer than a week. I honestly barely studied for the comp exams until the week before. And I’ve always been like that. I get hyperfixated on anything besides what it is I have to do, and end up with personal projects that I devote 95% of my energy to and are all I think about obsessively until I get overwhelmed and abandon them. They can be anything from redecorating a living room to starting a book blog to finding the most perfect diet plan or most perfect piece of clothing. I will become obsessed until I accomplish it or get bored of it. So many little things in my life overwhelm me when they’re not a part of my current fixation/project; feeding my cats, basic hygiene, keeping up with cleaning, even eating meals and sleeping. I feel frustrated, overwhelmed that I have these tasks that it feels like I can never keep up with and that interrupt me from my “projects”. At the same time, I WANT to keep up with life. I hate feeling constantly overwhelmed and lazy. 

The feeling of obsession and fixation I get on my projects isn’t pleasant, it’s overwhelming and I want to feel calm again so I hyper focus on doing the project. Often the only times I feel calm are when I’m neglecting responsibilities, but deeply I’m unhappy because I know there’s things I need to do and I WANT to do. 

I don’t know what all this means. I don’t know if it’s just an extension of my anxiety or if it’s a mental disorder at all, or just personal faults that I haven’t dealt with. But I know I want to stop running from the reality of what my life is like and figure out how to finally have a normal life.",11Sep2020,1
158,"Im 16 (M) and ever since quarantine started, me and my mother (Dad doesnt live with us) havent gotten along so well. There is no specific conflict between us, there are days where things go by smoothly and there is no problem. But the majority of the time, she ruins my mornings by giving me orders or speaks to me in a passive aggressive tone and all this subtle ways of pissing me off. And I try to keep my cool because:

First of all, I think “Well how can I get mad at my mother dont be a spoiled brat” or something along those lines.

Second of all, I know because of research its natural for teenagers to feel “rebelious” or “distant” towards their parents, but I dont want to feel that way, I just want peace in my house. (Actually I feel as if I already went through that fase anyway).

And third and lastly, among other things, something ive gotten into thanks to my spare time in quarantine is to be in touch with my emotions and to try to be the best version of myself, and because of that I dont want to feel anger or negativity but its like I cant help it, I feel like its my mothers fault but I cant help but doubt if im the one in the wrong here.

At one point I believed she was manipulative and toxic. Her behavior fits the description if you look it up on google but once again, I cant help but discard those thoughts by doubting myself and thinking that I may be the one in the wrong here. 

Also, ive put up with this for a lot of time but it reached a point where I feel like its the main cause of my stress. In general I feel like she is really selfish. I mean she is always complaining about how my dad doesnt earn enough money or doesnt transfer her the cash in time, but at the same time, she doesnt work, spends a lot of money on clothes, drives a better car than my dad. Like everything she has she hasnt earned it. 

Before you tell me to tell her this, ive tried, she doesnt listen, as soon as you call her out on anything she feels attacked and gets defensive and cries or gets pissy.

TL;DR: My mom is always giving me orders, being passive agressive and it bothers me alot. And I wish to know if anyone can relate? What can I do to make her stop or understand? Am I being dramatic? What can I do to ignore or dont let her attitude bother me?",11Sep2020,2

162,"This is a crosspost from r/raspberry_pi, so I hope that's allowed. Someone created a hardware interface which allows a raspberry pi to control lighting in response to their heart rate. They use it to help with depersonalisation and derealisation, and I wanted to share it here as I think there is potential for this to help others too. I work with young autistic people and lots of them have issues with interoception, which leads to issues like alexithymia. A visual representation of heart rate like this could help so much with issues like that, and also in developing a state of mindful meditation which can help with anxiety and depression. Hopefully some people here will find this interesting. If the OP updates the post with more details of how this was achieved I'll update here too :)

165,"Hi everyone! Day 11 of **Suicide Prevention Month**. 

Yesterday, Mental Health was the most spoken about subject throughout all social media. September the 10th is **World Suicide Prevention Day**, throughout social media, people from all around the world tweeted, shared, posted everything to do with Suicide Prevention and Mental Health in general. It was fantastic to see the world come together as one, to fight off this hateful illness. 

But, today. How many people are talking about it? Besides this sub and a few other people on social media, nobody has a word to say about it. What does this show us? People will care about you for a brief period of time, but in the end, they eventually give up on you. It’s well know that people from around the globe post a fitting tribute about Mental Health for easy likes, retweets, shares and reactions. While others, who are battling this illness, look up to this person for hope, motivation and faith, then suddenly realise this person doesn’t give a damn about the illness. 

**Mental Health should be the main talking point every single day**. Millions of people around the world suffer from this illness. From depression to anxiety, to suicidal thoughts and eating disorders. 

I decided to type this post on Day 11 of **Suicide Prevention Month** as it hit me like a bolt of lightning. As I was scrolling through social media, not a single world was said about Suicide Prevention or Mental Health. As they say “the hype is over”. Mental health needs to be taken seriously and taken seriously soon. 

During this pandemic, more people have died from Suicide than the virus itself. That stat is quite frankly, astonishing. In the year 2020, this is how a typical conversation goes regarding someone who is pleading for help...

**Person 1**: Please help me. I suffer from Mental illness. I would greatly appreciate your help in any way. 

**Person 2**: Ok, what’s wrong with you?

**Person 1**: *proceeds to tell his/hers story*

**Person 2**: Ok. Let me tweet something out first. *tweets a motivation quote*

**Person 1**: Thank you so much, you don’t realise how much this means to me. 

**Person 2**: *tweet doesn’t get much acknowledge* I’m sorry, I can’t help you. But, good luck. 

**Person 1**: *self-esteem lowers*

Typically how a conversation would go this day and age. 

**TAKE MENTAL HEALTH SERIOUSLY**. Close to 800,000 people do every year from suicide. That’s roughly 1 person every 40 seconds. Typing a TWEET would usually last more than 40 seconds. How about that TWEET, that POST, that SHARE can be something useful? For you, it may mean nothing... but for someone else, someone who is on the other side of the World to you... it could save his/hers life. 

Mental Health shouldn’t be the main topic for 1 day a year, it should be the main topic **every.single.day** of the year.",11Sep2020,1
166,"The company I work for laid off a whole bunch of people - in my department alone, we lost 30 about 3 months ago, then 10 more yesterday.  That’s nearly half our staff.  So many of them were very good friends of mine, and most have been with the company 10+ years!  I feel awful that they’re cast aside so nonchalantly, yet I get to stay?  I feel like I’m barely staying productive here, there’s so little work to do.  How much worse was it for them?  Or was it even about productivity at all?  Maybe it was random.  No one tells us anything.  What kills me the most is that this company has bragged year after year in their quarterly meetings how many billions of dollars we made, yet they can’t stand to take any sort of loss at all?  Fuck all of them.  Now I’m hating myself for staying, but they pay too well for me to up and leave without a backup in place.

167,"I’m not sure if this qualify as something that I should post here but I don’t know where else to ask. 
One of my earliest memory is sitting on an armchair in a living room playing with my sister who sat on the arm rest. Then she fall back and then blank, nothing at all. The next thing I remember is standing outside of my living room watching a car leave. 
From what my mother told me what happened is when I was about 2 years old, me and my sister (only about a year old) was playing with something on the chair so we both sat on the armrest, then when no one was looking my sister fall on to a glass shelf which shatter and pierce both her back and her neck (she is okay but still have scars from the incident). She was rushed to a hospital while I was left home with my grandma.
What bother me is that I can’t remember what happened no matter how much I try. I have been known to roughhouse with my sister a lot when we were young and whenever I think about it I keep wondering did I push her? No one blame me for the incident but I just feel incredibly guilty about it. Especially now that she complain about how she can’t wear some clothes because of the scar. Is this normal? Am I just imagine thing and feel guilty for nothing?",11Sep2020,1
168,"Well, this is probably going to need a bit of a backstory... let’s start last November, when I got a text from my boyfriend saying we should break up. At the time, this was the end of the world to me, because my immature brain had somehow convinced itself that our relationship was ‘perfect’. Yuck.

At this point in my life, I had already self-harmed in the past. Hell, I must have done it not long before that night, because I remember trying to hide the marks on my leg for halloween. But I never really wanted it to go further than that. I was scared of the idea of death, there was no way I could actually want it.

So... let’s fast forward to February. My mental health was on a sort of slow decrease, nothing too extreme compared to what I was used to - though thinking about it now, I seemed to get angry really easily. To the point where I had big bruises on my arm from repeatedly hitting myself. But hey, at least I stopped cutting right? And for once, I wasn’t feeling so bad about my appearance. Maybe I felt like crying a lot more than usual, and maybe one time I did break down in front of my friends for no real reason, but that’s normal right?

Haha. Wrong.

By early March, I had started to *consider* suicide. Key word: consider. I didn’t actually *want* to do it... it was just an idea in the back of my head. Which then turned into a plan. And then?

We went into lockdown.

I felt pretty good for... well, a couple of weeks. I don’t really remember *exactly* when it started, but it must have been in late March/early April when I started to feel a lot worse than usual. I felt like I was going to cry over any little thing. But night time was the worst. Some nights I cried, some nights I didn’t. But every night, I *wanted* to kill myself. 

The worst part about being suicidal? Not being able to think of a reason to live.

I spent every night questioning whether I would make it to the next day or just give up. Only my best friend knew about it. I think the closest I came was the day I was in the bath and I breathed in some of the water. I wasn’t really thinking about it, it just... happened. I think that was the moment I realised I should probably talk to someone.

I ended up telling a small group of friends about it and honestly? Things started to get better after that. I made some new friends, and I finally got over that ex I mentioned earlier. Things were pretty good. 

After that? Well, I started school again on Monday.

I had been looking forward to it for a while, actually. I was excited to see my friends again. And the first day back was really fun! My friends said I was being really quiet, but I didn’t really think much of it. I thought maybe they just... forgot how quiet I was or something? I mean, we hadn’t seen each other for six months.

Tuesday was pretty good as well. Wednesday was average. Yesterday... I felt like crying for no reason again. I don’t know what happened. I thought I sorted everything out. 

Today was the worst day this week. I was really out of it. Maybe it’s because I got offended over a stupid joke my friends made, maybe it was going to happen anyway. But I was almost at the point of tears when someone asked me if I was okay... why am I back in this situation again?

I really don’t know what to do. I don’t think talking to a professional is exactly an option because I *really* don’t want to have that conversation with my parents right now. I just don’t know why I’m going back into this state. I feel like I want to talk to someone but at the same time I don’t want to seem like some selfish, oversensitive brat who gets offended over everything.

I think I need some advice...",11Sep2020,1

I’ve recently started suspecting a friend of mine is self harming, I wouldn’t want to assume especially since I haven’t been told directly, but I’m really concerned.

For context, I met him in my first school year (we just  started our last a few days ago) we sit on the same table every morning for our registration period
(called “form” in the UK) however, we are not in each others immediate friend group, hence why I don’t know how to show my support, since I feel like I’m the only one who’s noticed but I don’t want to overstep. This is the first school year he has fully came out and the whole school (teachers and students) to refer to him with his new name and he/him pronouns. On the most part this has been handled respectfully, and I’ve stepped in to help/correct/educate when i can.

I noticed bandages wrapped round his whole wrists (one of our mutual friends even brought him in some more 2 days ago) and he’s been using them daily. He also posted some concerning things to his Instagram story in extremely small font (that I could only just manage to read) along with a countdown.(I believe this countdown if for a goal of days clean of self harm based on what I read, but I can’t risk being wrong and assuming)

I don’t know what to do without over stepping my boundaries, I would like to tell a teacher but since I’m only assuming it would feel wrong, and possibly result in a even bigger invasion of privacy from a teacher who hes not close with. I want to deal with this and be the best support I possibly can, any advice/ responses would be appreciated!",11Sep2020,1

175,"My wife was abused as a child pretty severely by her dad. This led to a life of bad relationships, alcohol abuse and poor decisions. She had been married three times before me (yes I know but she said they all were mentally abusive and one was cheating on her). When I met her at 37 she had gotten her masters degree in child psychology, was a wonderful and warm human being, and had promised therapy had allowed her to put the past behind her and move on. She was ready for a “good guy.”
We were married a year after dating and things seemed to be ok at first. About a year in I noticed she was taking quite a bit of anxiety and depression medication. She had constant migraines and health issues. Her sex drive was non-existent and she admitted she never enjoyed sex. She also slowly stopped doing things with me and my daughter but hyper focused on her daughter’s activities. She became a shut in/homebody never wanting to leave the house.
Despite this I still loved her and we had lots of good times. She would vacation with us on beach trips and cruises. Unfortunately about a year ago she started actively ignoring my daughter and I so I started doing things without her. Right before lockdown I knew we needed to have a conversation about fixing things as we weren’t going in the right direction. I attempted to reach out but she would shut me down.
I took a trip with my daughter out to visit family and she texted me saying the marriage was over and they were leaving. I was in shock and totally blindsided. Over a period of time I convinced her to continue living with us as a roommate and she agreed as long as I never tried to fix it.

I have major depressive disorder and bad anxiety. In the past I was on Remeron (SSRI) and had amazing results but it stopped working. I also was prescribed Xanax in the past and it helped a lot but due to pregnancy, I stopped using them and I’m not sure my psychiatrist will put me back on Xanax because so many people are abusing it now. I’m scared to be put on a different anxiety med because Xanax worked best for me with no side effects or withdrawal. I’m not sure if something more is going on mentally but I just feel highly disconnected. I feel so anxious constantly that I never get that “ping” of happiness in my heart that I used to get. It’s almost like I’m living in a bubble, not soaking in the happiness around me. It’s particularly upsetting because I have a baby who I love but I feel like I’m not living in the moment enough with her due to my thoughts and I know I’ll regret this, but I can’t fix it alone.

When i first noticed it (age 9)I was constantly sad, lost of appetite, loss of energy, and had couldn't sleep. Which later fell into a fantasy world in my head which to me was happy. Over time I became more interested in death, not as in wanting it but what was it like. Then when I started puberty a year later the agression and isolation fell in. I separated myself socially and when I was focused or something happened unexpectedly I would get angry. This anger could last just a few seconds to the longest of 7 months recently. When I'm that upset i normally fall hard into a bit of depression for a bit. 

Around 15 when I noticed what wanted in life did I become focused on it and drove a hard for it. But when I was going hard for it and nothing was really changing would I just give up and start over. And then did I start feeling remorse for my loved ones who had been dead for years by then. I regularly do this.

I can be so enthusiastic and energetic about something. And it's not always in a positive why, this brings out a competitiveness that pushes me to my own limits and I dont stop even when tired. 

When I was 17 I fell hard for a girl. Thought she was the world to me but only now when I look back do I release I was controlling, and mentally abusive to her. But I did not mean to be this way. If I was talking to someone and my phone rang or I tripped it would bring out a anger in me, I will throw what ever I had in my hands or even break my phone(6 times in 1 year). I would even go as far has to punch walls and doors. And when I was hit with some depression I will cry for hour on end. Feeling lost and trying not too be me. In those moments I want to hurt myself but I always fight myself. 

Iv noticed I will talk to myself(and respond) , to my emotions, and to objects.

Recently a girl asked me out and after being with her for a bit(she is 18 and has IED, how similar we act but I always seem more aggressive about it and there is more to it on my end.

For years friends say I Bipolar, But knowing little about it idk what that means. And I am asking for anyone who is professional who can tell .e if I need to reach out for help. My parents never cared about it and didn't see it as important. Now that I'm 18 I want answers. And I want to k ow if there is help for me.",11Sep2020,1

Recently I’ve felt like everyone hates me. My friends, family, and everyone I know. They haven’t shown any signs that they hate me.

184,"I have never opened up to anyone about this but I'm hoping somone can help me out. 3 years ago I started to feel really down and started to think negatively as I always compared myself to my friends. They were the ones always getting somewhere in life whether it's succeeding in their exams or having girlfriends and just generally having fun. I know I shouldn't compare myself to others but I dont feel like I ever did something I'm proud of or at least something I can look back on and feel proud. One of the problems I have is that im underweight, not necessarily anorexic but definitely closer to that than normal. One of my friends had the same problem and managed to gain around 7 kilos in 3 months, I told him I was happy for him but to this day it makes me feel like more of a failure, I've been trying to gain for so long and was doing so well but it all comes crashing down every time I try. I manage to gain something then lose it all within a few days, and it comes back to haunt me. I read so much advice on weight gain but it always comes down to 'eating more' but thats not helpful to me. My other problem is my negative approach to life, I'm not sucidal but I don't enjoy anything. I always think of the worst scenario even to the smallest issue. The friend I mentioned earlier has also tried helping with my apporach but my negative energy is far too strong for him. I could doubt myself and say things like ""I'm not gonna be able to do that"" or ""I wish I was as good as you but of course I can't be"" and he would just stay away from me but I don't blame him for it. 

I really don't know what to do at this point.",11Sep2020,1

186,"Hey everyone, I'm new to the group, wanted to maybe open up a conversation about mental health issues artists like me face in todays extremely fast paced entertainment industry. I know its a huge topic. Personally, I struggle with anxiety and depression in being independent artist. I feel like a lot of people like me....

*(in their 20's, has career dreams, maybe 2 many goals, maybe over the top with ambition, maybe a little bit ADD, and ultimately just struggles to be happy because personal happiness is never a priority when you are focused on so many things at once)*

End up internalizing everything, pushing friends or significant others away unknowingly of how, or even end up just giving up on various levels. 

I really feel like social media and the judgement that comes along side of it has played a huge role in making it harder for people to communicate who they are, how they are, what they need, what they want, what makes them happy... etc. 

Basically that is something I'm struggling to expand on, and my goal as an artist is to help people facing the same mental health issues gain new perspectives that ultimately help them get to a better place. This isn't too promote, but In case anyone wants to help start this conversation, I wrote a song about my ongoing struggle. Maybe it will help people understand what I'm talking about because I know I just went on a rant...

187,"tw: mentions of several types of abuse

I'm going to share just one of the many experiences as a child I had with spanking.
It was late at night. My dad had to go to work in the morning, and we weren't supposed to talk, but my sister and I were whispering to each other. Suddenly, the door bangs open and we're being dragged out of bed by our arms. My dad bends me over his knees and starts hitting my legs hard, I want to scream but decide to be silent and ""zone out"" - this is what started my dissociation. ""If I show anything negative, he wins."" Next, he does it to my sister. I'm watching, still zoned out, she's screaming and crying and trying to cover herself, he hits harder. He tells her she should be in a ""home"" - as in, a home for ""bad kids"". We're about 4 and 6 years old. We go to bed crying, and still whispering about how much we hate him, now.
This was a regular thing. Once I was pulled out of the bathtub naked to be hit, because I ""wasn't supposed to take a bath today"". I was hit - again, naked - once, because while I was changing with my sister, I guess we got into a fight and I smacked her arm. So I'm not allowed to hit, but my parents are?
Maybe I view this as abusive because I grew up in an otherwise abusive home - my mom was constantly screaming at us that she was going to kill herself and how she would do it, and then run out the door and disappear for a while. She would have flashbacks and not know who we were and tell us that she wasn't going to let us hurt her. I remember my siblings hiding the knives in the house, because at their young age, that's all they knew someone could use to kill themselves. My dad would scream at us, drag us around, lock us in dark rooms for hours, threaten to tie us up or strangle us, call us names, etc. I was also sexually abused by a couple of family friends.
I just don't think you can hit a child in any way - whether that's spanking, slapping, smacking, etc. - without teaching the child that their body doesn't belong to them, that no one needs to respect them. I think I learned to dissociate under stress, I have the hardest time showing my emotions or communicating. I also jump when I'm alone in a room and someone comes in, and have a hard time with confrontation.",11Sep2020,2
188,"As the title states, just wonder what feelings and emotions you went through after your wife went back to work full-time in a different job. 

I'm not sure what it is but I'm feeling insecure, I have no reason to be and as far as I know my wife has never cheated on me. 

Suddenly we have no time for eachother with home commitments and two children, it's getting to me as my life is still the same, before the pandemic  I was playing football once a week and hitting the gym 3 times a week. 

On the other hand my wife found it very tough through the start of the lockdown, she lost her job and become housebound with the kids, she managed to get a new full-time job that I am thankful for and she had been feeling not worthy working part-time in jobs that didn't suit her skills. 

I know I'm sounding irrational but I cant seems to shake these feelings, I know what I have to do but I'm down a hole, I think it's always been there and I can't exactly say my wife getting the job is the main reason for these feelings, it feels like fog, like I'm always thinking about some negative or coming up with scenario's.

Also my wife goes out for walks with her friends, but if she's late coming home i can feel the frustration building up inside of me, I'm not a controlling person at all but I feel like one. 

Little tiny things my wife doesn't do like not kissing me when she gets home from work are really getting to me, I've questioned her about who works with her has any men come onto her. 

I know these are my feelings and emotions I need to get a grip of, there's more I can write but I just wanted validate my thoughts for now, I needed to get them down somewhere so I can read them. 

Anyway, I'm am open book so ask me any questions you wish, and call me a jerk as much as you like as I know I am being one and my wife doesn't deserve it, these strong feelings and emotions started the day she started work, two weeks ago and I'm scared I'll push her away.

191," I hate putting myself out there but I'm still writing this post in the hopes that it might help someone.

Due  to reasons I went to see a psychiatrist and I had to go on my own. It  was honestly terrifying and so anxiety-inducing but I wanted to share  some tips. Maybe it will make it easier for anyone else out there.

1. Visit the place before your appointment.

I  read a book by Elaine N. Aron on HSP. She mentions somewhere that  visiting a place before an event can help you substantially with your  anxiety. I second this. I went to the clinic a couple of days beforehand  and just knowing where I had to go without thinking too much about it  helped a lot.

2. Go early.

Same  principle as above. Go early so you have some time in the waiting room.  No need to go to the reception just yet. Just get used to the waiting  room. It helped me a lot. When you're ready you can go to the reception  and tell them that you have an appointment. When you go back to sit down  it should be a lot easier.

3. Do something nice for yourself.

Talking  about your vulnerabilities can be incredibly uncomfortable and  stressing so promise yourself that you'll do something nice when your  appointment is over. What works for you only you know. Don't feel too  bad about spending a little money on something you know that you'll  enjoy. It's payment for a job well done. Personally I went and bought a  new book.

On a sidenote I always recommend having a book around. Especially one with fond memories attached.

I'm posting this on a couple of mental health subreddits to try and reach as many as possible.

I truly hope this helps anyone out there and if anyone has similar experiences or anything to add please do so.",11Sep2020,1

193,"It's been about 5 to 6 years since the last time I cried. My tear ducts seem completely fine. I tear up quite often, in the morning especially. Lately have been feeling especially down, but every time I try and just cry, it's like reaching for something that isn't there. I just sit there feeling more empty and tired. It really feel like I'm missing something, almost like I'm sleep deprived whenever I feel sad. 

Instead of being properly sad I just become psychotically ""upbeat"" and reminding myself that this is just how things are and who the fuck cares. If things get really bad I might even cynically dry laugh at my own shitty situation. It's not a happy laughter, but it seems to come almost compulsively, building first from a snicker then just coming in short bursts. It REALLY hurts in my chest when I laugh that way. 

I don't know if there's any way I can ""rediscover"" how to cry. I just feel so lost when I want to but aren't able to just, properly be sad. Maybe it's the emotion itself that is missing. I don't know anymore. 

It just makes me feel like something has broken inside me, permanently.

I think most of my friends and family just see me as a lost cause, too far lost to properly fix,"" just make sure he isn't suicidal and keep him that way."" I don't even know who to go to anymore. I've talked to shrinks but the same ""what do you want us to do about it?"" seems to be the final destination of all the ones I've talked to. I've considered therapy, but economy isn't stable enough to go to something that ""may or may not help"". 

Even when I was properly suicidal I wasn't ""typically"" suicidal. Basically I just logically feel life is more effort than it is worth. I was told a million times that ""it will get better"". I feel at the very least more stable now, but I never really stopped being suicidal. I just got more comfortable and now has more comforts to convince me not to end it. I still feel the exact same way. I wouldn't say I am suicidal, but honestly it's just always there in the back of my head. I don't say it, (because I've been accused of using it as a bargaining chip and honestly that's both patronizing and offensive) but every now and then if someone tells me that ""you're just gonna have to live with it"", a part of me in full seriousness goes ""yeah no, it won't come to that. Trust me.""

I really don't know what to do with myself any more. Right now I'd say I live more for the sake of those around me than for my own, so I'm not really considering taking my own life exactly, but this feels like fucking garbage. When do I get to be happy? I've felt happiness, love, friendship and trust in my dreams, I know how it's supposed to feel. Everything just seems to always turn out terrible. I even think that was a diagnosis I got one time, as in ""you're not depressed, you're just living a very depressing life"". I wish I'd stop being pessimistic all the time, but then I'd stop being correct all the time as well. 

I just want to cry about all the things I just talked about and so much more. My miserable childhood, my miserable adolescence, my miserable 21 year long line of almost comically over the top emotional fragility. My mental breakdowns. How my girlfriend just doesn't love me anymore. How much I hate how every single good thing becomes boring and mundane, but every bad thing gets worse and worse. 

As I'm typing this I can see my reflection in the window next to me. Stone faced, tired expression. I don't hate it, I just feel so indifferent and empty inside. I can feel ""laughter"" bubbling in my chest.  I just want to break down and cry it all out. But I can't.",11Sep2020,1

I feel anxious solely from the fact that I have these thoughts and wanted to see if anyone else out there has felt this way before.

200,"I'm (21 FtM) so tired. I've got severe chronic depression and probably lupus, both of which have a symptom of being extremely fatigued.

To say that my father is typically the more understanding parent of the two is an understatement. My folks don't respect my identity, and I can't even have a conversation with my mother about it without her having a screaming fit. For now, I have to live with these people.

This being the way things are, I've decided not to tell my mother that i have lupus yet, as I've not been ""officially"" diagnosed, but from what the doctors said, it's very likely the reason for a lot of the health issues I'm having, so it's highly likely. I have to get more testing done when I come home from my trip. I don't feel comfortable telling my mom things because she freaks out about every little thing.

I'm always talking about my mom and how she causes problems, but today my dad really frustrated me. 

I live in a big house, and I have a dog who doesn't always come when called. This morning I woke up and after a while noticed my 80 lb dog was nowhere to be found. I was freaking out because when I'm the only person home, he is my responsibility. I thought everyone else was at work or school. After looking around the whole house for half an hour, I texted my dad asking where the dog was. I got no reply. Looked around the house for the dog again. I probably spent an hour or more looking for my dog, calling him,  shaking his bag of treats all around the house, filling up his food bowl because he comes running to the sound of that, and I even looked around the backyard. I called my mom and she told me she didnt know where he was but that he was probably with my dad. All in all I spend over an hour looking for him when I had things I needed to get done. My dad texted me that he had the dog and was home 5 minutes later. I was exhausted from looking for him everywhere. 

Immediately my father asked me to mow the lawn. I told him I was really exhausted already and he told me that was bull, as I had slept in this morning. It is not a small lawn, when again,  I'm supposed to be doing other things I need to have done today, as well as the fact that my family bugged me and bugged me for weeks about celebrating my birthday with them tonight (I'm out of town on my actual birthday and away from them thank god) until I gave in. My mom even told my relatives not to get me anything for my birthday probably because I said no to having dinner with them initially.

Now I'm exhausted, and on top of all that I need a shower today now because I mowed the lawn, which is even more energy consuming. 

I need to pack for my trip, and being an unorganized person with unmedicated ADHD, that is going to be very difficult on it's own, without the added exhaustion. 

You may say ""hey why aren't you doing it now, you have time,"" but I am too tired. I am beyond tired. My body does not want to move. I feel like I will end up puking if I try.

I have things to do. I have to do some cleaning before I leave and go through the excruciating task of packing my bag. I need this time to recuperate but I also need it to do those things. When I'm done feeling like I'm gonna vomit, I'm going to get up and go do what i need, and if I'm really really lucky, I might get to bed early enough to get 6-8 hours of sleep, when really, because of what's going on with me medically, I need about 10 or I'm going to have a miserable day tomorrow, which at this point seems inevitable. I'm going to see my partner for the first time in months and I'm going to be cranky and miserable and fall asleep as soon as I can. My partner shouldn't have to deal with that, especially because when I feel bad, he feels bad. 

My family is utterly exhausting. I'm so damn fatigued that it's hard to do anything, and they expect me to function like a normal person, even though I have a physical and mental limiting factor there.

I woke up less than 4 hours ago and I'm already ready to go back to bed, but I've got a long day ahead of me, followed by not enough sleep, followed by another long day where I'm travelling. Its ridiculous.",11Sep2020,1

My brother sends me constant articles or other accomplishments then criticizes me for having an employer (despite that I have a doctorate). He constantly talks about homes he wants to buys- but never takes actions. I know he does well but I suspect he inflates his wealth to us. He constantly insults the “middle class” and tries to force us to think like “wealthy” people even though we are all quite simple. Btw I make six figs and do well for myself.

211,"I'm atheist and transgender (FtM). My family supports neither of those things and I really haven't told them that I dont believe in god but I'm sure they know by the way I act. 

I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this. I just really hate my birthday for a lot of reasons. I'm spending my actual birthday in a few days with my partner and their family, whom I'm not telling that it's my birthday. (My partner knows)

Birthdays have been a miserable occurence for me, especially since I came out, but they always sort of have been. Ever since I can remember my parents, mostly my mother, have something to ruin it, or somehow humiliate me. For this reason I always insist on not going out for dinner for my birthday, which they make me do anyway. It isn't just being unthoughtful either. One year I(a shy socially anxious at the time vegetarian) begged them not to take me out, so they decided we were going to a steakhouse. I also begged them not to tell them it was my birthday, as I did not want all eyes on me for the dreaded birthday song. You'll never guess what happened. It gets worse. While I was eating my side of fries (all the restaurant had that I could eat) the waitstaff brought out this wooden thing with a saddle on it and made me sit on it and wave a napkin around while they sung. I almost cried right there, I definitely did when I got home, and I can remember my mom smiling as she took a video. I hate being on camera. Stuff like this happens almost every year. I have to have dinner with them tonight and listen to them talk about how much I should appreciate them for buying me dinner, when I genuinely want nothing to do with them, and definitely do not want to spend my birthday with them.

My mother is mad at me for a host of reasons, and mostly things I cannot control, such as my depression. She is angry that I am stressing her out and telling me that I am faking it. This year she told my relatives on her side of the family not to get me anything for my birthday and it got back around to me. She has also told them in the past to get me things that are as feminine as possible, starting right when my mother outed me to them. For the past 5 years, I have gotten almost exclusively stuff like makeup and nail polish and frilly socks that nobody my age would even wear, as well as more christian paraphernalia than I have ever seen in my life. These people have seen the way I dress and it bothers me so much that they would, first of all, waste their money on this sort of thing, and secondly, my depression gets worse with the clutter that this sort of thing brings. I don't feel like I'm allowed to get rid of it because they're the type of relatives to ask about how much I like what they got me. What am I supposed to say to that? No?

This year I did not get any gifts from anyone that I will ever touch other than food. My aunt brought me half of her lunch today and it is the best gift I have received, even though it was cold. I feel extremely guilty about these gifts, yet I know my family is just trying to push me into a box, and I dont think they realize how much of a toll it takes on my mental health. I also feel bad that none of my family even seems to have any idea who I am. They dont know what my interests are. I have not worn makeup in probably over 6 years and I just got makeup wipes. 

My birthday is supposed to be at least kinda about what I want isnt it? Or is that too selfish? I just feel like if I had a good time and was not wracked with guilt, it would have been good for me, but I'm also aware that my own birthday may be tainted with shit for the rest of my life. I feel so ungrateful about the gifts and about the forced birthday dinners. It feels wrong to be upset about this sort of thing. What do y'all think?",11Sep2020,1

218,"I'm starting to lose taste of everything.

Everything I've built is meaningless without a little piece that stepped away from me.


I've known since long time that I shouldn't build thinking in someone else but myself but I really thought things were meant to stay.


I got so caught on in the process of building and planification for this ""machine"" (which could be considered a group of works, projects and plans), that I was ignorant that I was straining what I wanted so hard to keep together and some cracks from before started to get bigger until they gave away.


Since then I was hopeful that the piece would return, sort every thing that was harmful, mending the cracks and start fitting that piece I had with me for so long in the grand scheme of my machine.


But it didn't happen, and I accepted it, respecting the will of someone that I know I have put weight on, and decided to simply save my machine for someone else.


Then I found 2 individuals apart from each other that I really, really thought would be the new piece to turn on my now rusty machine.


But we are an in an ever changing world, and people are changing alongside, the values one appreciates from before are now forgotten by now and everyone you find now have a totally different perspective and mentallity, the first person simply toyed with my expectance of a reliable partner, making it look like she was invested in the idea of building.


But it was all a game, probably I was a temporal piece she wanted to fit around until she wanted a new one, once I caught on her game I simply did not let her pick me and fit me in whatever warped agglomeration of scraps she was working on.


The second one could have fit my machine, It looked like it would, but seemed like a fragile and unstable piece that would break at any moment.


After loneliness kicked in, the original piece presented herself on my sight again and initially I thought the piece was just there for show but not to be picked by me so I accepted it and remained as a simple spectator without any attempt to intrude past the idea of just looking at her.


But after exposing myself for so long to her I started wavering and it reminded my why that piece was so perfect, why my machine was made for that piece. She was here after all, why would she be here if not to be picked by me.


After all she is a piece so unique the world should be proud of creating, what this piece does, her stance in this world, her lack of ill intent, her desire to improve what she has around, makes her all around perfect.
She had some rough edges I wanted to polish since long ago but...


Us going back was not what happened and in my attempt to pick the piece, I realized the piece was so hot it was not meant to be picked, leaving my fingers burned because of my naiveness.


But I like having the piece there, appearing in front of me, it always have been healthy to just look at it and I prefer being able to watch her there than the piece just not being there at all, and she probably watches me too in hopes I fit somewhere, and if she fits on another machine, I will be glad instead of resentful.


But I'm still scarred, my skin still burns and my machine still lacks a piece.


I have everything I could ask for as a person, I have a roof, I have income, I have savings, a skill that I have passion for and carries me trough the dullity of the day to day, projects to fullfill or mantain, and a clear goal to reach, but I just can't taste it as well anymore.


I feel all I have is just for survival but not for enjoyment despite relating to what I'm supposed to enjoy.
It lets me not starve but I cannot savour it anymore.


My mind is decaying, my identity is being trivialized and i'm fearing I'll eventually just turn into a machine that does but not feels, a program that runs on parameters but not on algorythms.


I really have no one to talk to this way, everyone I know wants my fun side but never my open side, including relatives.

 
The only one I could open to was her, the only one I felt that really listened but yeah, how in my right mind would I talk to her about her now.


I always have developed a little nihilistic side since adolescense, and the world as a whole and its people keep giving me no reason to think differently but the time I was with her always kept me forgetting about it and appreciating only the good, which is no longer the case.


Suicidal thougths sometimes cross my mind, but I feel that doing such thing would dissapoint her, I've always known how she thinks about suicide and a mental apparition of her lecturing me always has stopped me from developing such thoughts past the  ""just crossed my mind"" phase.


Believe that I want to be strong, I think I'm being strong, I went to some psychological sessions a little bit after the breakup and although the service was pretty much dissapointing, It helped me by learning how to think and with some research I managed to keep my emotions under control and I'm waiting for bookings to be open from my social insurance so I can have some analysis on ADHD I found not long before I had. But in the end, being strong does not accomplish anything besides being able to exist.


I know some of you say it is all grieving and it will go away, and I want to think that, it is more complex than that, and my grieving phase already has passed, twice, when the breakup happened and when I thought we could go back but didn't.


In fact I have lost some weight I gained since the start of the year but I'm already slowly starting to go back to shape so that ""body grieving"" is no longer there.


I just don't think I can feel, that anything I accomplish has no value other than keeping my feet moving forward when what I want is to move my feet on my own and taste every step I take.


I'm not looking for good thoughts or wishes that things will become better because they are good, relatively. I just wanted to vent and let all my negative emotions flow out so they stop clogging my mind, because in the end nothing will change the emptiness.",11Sep2020,1
219,"**Hey all!**

My name is Sam. I'm a freelance graphic and web designer who has been affected greatly by the coronavirus. I struggle with anxiety and depression on a regular basis but job loss, lack of social time, and the constant feeling of impending doom really played an extra heavy toll on me this year. I needed to find a new creative outlet to get my juices flowing again. So, I returned to my PC gaming roots and decided to share my passion through live streaming and content creation.

**A little history:**

My gaming career began in the early '90s when I was introduced to PC games for the first time. The earliest titles I remember playing are Duke Nukem, Doom, Quake, and Myst. It was 1998 when I realized I was going to be a lifelong gamer. The first time I played competitively online (Delta Force), it was love at first victory.

Growing up, I was a particularly husky boy who didn't excel at any sports or other ""normal"" activities. I was known as a mathlete and a squirrel boy (thanks to my chubby cheeks). I did, however, learn early on that I had a knack for competitive gaming. Over the years, I evolved into a multiplatform gamer and slowly moved away from PC gaming as consoles became more popular with my friends.

Flash forward to 2020, a newfound love for survival and indie games has drawn me right back to my PC gaming roots. And it's where I intend to stay.

**Back to the point:**

2020 has been so difficult for most of us. I personally ***needed*** to return to an old passion and find a new creative outlet. PC gaming, streaming, and content creation was the prescription I needed. It's already helped my mental health and well-being a tremendous amount. I've made fantastic relationships, discovered new games to explore, and settled into a community where I feel I belong.

**And most importantly:**

I hope every single one of you that have felt underwater this year is able to reignite your fire and pursue your passions like it's your only chance. This year, if nothing else, I've learned that change is the only guarantee in life. Tomorrow is never promised. Please, please, please take your passions seriously and chase them relentlessly until the lights go out.

**Peace, love, and prosperity to you all.**

Cheers,

220,I don’t know how to write this so sorry if it doesn’t make much literal sense but My Best Friend is currently cutting himself off from group chats and social life and is slowly slipping into a deeper depression. He describes it as “dealing with his emotions”. Anyway at school he seems to be one of the happiest people when he is with us away from his family but there are sometimes he I look across the room and can see that he is hurting inside. Tonight he left our group chat and we kept asking him if he is ok. He keeps saying that he’s fine but I know he’s not and I really want to help him because he is such a kindhearted person.

Like the title suggests, I hear voices inside my head. Now let me explain, I know when a song is stuck in your head and you can kinda hear the music and everything.

But I hear people (I know) talking. They’re saying things I’m not even thinking about. Also, every time I hear these voices; there’s a ringing noise in my ears that doesn’t go away for awhile. Sometimes the ringing drives me crazy.

It’s not like I hear these voices outta nowhere, like I have to close my eyes in a quiet place to hear these voices. For example, I was laying in bed last night, pitch black and quiet, and I heard these two voices talking to each other, not even saying anything directly to me.

I know I sound fucking crazy but should I be worried about it? They just say random shit, nothing negative or positive. This has been going on for awhile, but only yesterday I noticed it happening more.

227,"Okay, hi! I’m Ellie. I’m someone who suffers with a lot of anxiety and has to rationalise “worst-case scenario” thoughts daily (when I’m at my worst). One thing that I’ve learnt that I feel will pertain to almost anyone suffering with anxiety or other mental illnesses under the category of neuroticism is to NOT LET ‘AUTOMATIC NEGATIVE THOUGHTS’ TAKE CONTROL OF OUR BRAINS. Automatic Negative Thoughts are those thoughts you get about a situation or the future that are inherently negative or detrimental to your overall mental health and mood (this is exempt of necessary negative thoughts, such as - “if I trip on this bridge, I’ll get seriously injured/die” of course) one thing that I’ve found is closely associated with anxiety and low-mood is this constant, routine believing of ANT’s. One thing that is undoubtedly true is that our brains LIE to us. Our brain does not know everything, of course and makes MANY mistakes and misinterpretations. When we get an automatic thought that isn’t going to contribute to the bettering of our mood, then it is not worth it - squash it, like an ant. Disregard it. It doesn’t exist outside of your brain. It is wasteful matter. Don’t overpopulate your brain with trash that isn’t even true at the end of the day! Instead, make a conscious effort to populate your brain with positive things that make you feel better - the results will show. Thoughts like “they’re gonna think I’m weird”, “I’m gonna hate this”, “this is gonna make me feel AWFUL” &amp; millions and MILLIONS of other sentences we speak out in our brain and treat as gospel. As someone who suffers with health anxiety (an intense version of hypochondria), my negative thoughts consist of, “this constipation is bowel cancer” etc, etc - you get it. Making ‘absolute’ statements in your brain is common in people who feel heightened levels of anxiety/depression - this is one of the driving forces of these mental illnesses for the large part. To say that one day these negative thoughts will just disappear through the conscious effort to eradicate them is untrue - it’s a trained thought process that gradually decreases your levels of anxiety as you teach the brain to dismiss these negative thoughts. Once the pattern is established in your brain, the positive effects will begin to show and will result in you having a great decrease in levels of anxiety etc. Hope this helps someone, if you’re struggling, you have got this. You’re not alone, hundreds of thousands of people around the world are feeling the way you do and hundreds of thousands more have got their minds under control. Trust me, YOU HAVE GOT THIS! We’re in this together ❤️",11Sep2020,1

232,"Here are a few tips I've gathered along my life that have aided me to help myself.

I hope I'm allowed to post this here. If no I apologise. 

Try and slow down, everything is so fast nowadays. We have movies on demand, we have friends inside our phone that can be contacted in an instant, we have food that can be at your door in less than an hour. All this promotes impatience. SLOW DOWN. take the time to do things and enjoy them. Instead of cooking quick meals and ordering food. Cook yourself a dinner and be mindful whilst doing it, focusing on every little detail and you'll feel accomplished.

Find a non destructive coping mechanism. This can be a massive help. Most people stray towards destructive ways such as, alcohol, drugs, smoking and isolating themselves. For me personally I like knitting, playing video games (not competive games) they make me worse and as daft as it sounds, singing Hakuna Matata in my head when in a stressful situation.

Find friends that actually care and avoid toxic people. I spent ages with friends trying so hard to feel validated by what they say and do but this was my biggest downfall. You can't make somebody care about you. No matter how hard you try. 

Consider medication. Some people are scared of going onto medication because they feel it will show them as being weak or it'll turn them into a robot. This isn't the case when you find what works best for you. Your GP can help and point you in the right direction but just remember they aren't trained therapists. 

Look into people's eyes more. This is a monumental task at first but start small. Maintain a moderate amount of eye contact whilst walking past someone in the street and smile. DO NOT LOOK AT THE FLOOR. If you struggle to look at people's eyes, look at the bridge of their nose first and slowly work up to their eyes. 

Tell yourself that others are going through the same thing. You're not on your own and things will get better. 

Get to know somebody older than you that has probably been through similar life experiences. 

If you get anxious about the unknown follow a routine so that you know what you are doing and when you're doing it. 



If this post helps just one person it's done it's job.

234,"Recently I started imagining that the pillow I cuddle with every night was my girlfriend and I'd daydream how we were the best couple, and I kissed the pillow allot and imagined how her face would blush and how I'd ask her if she wanted a hug or not. At first I always imagined her to say yes but then I felt that first idea that came up to me was that she's uncomfortable then I got the idea that she would say yes, so I prioritized literally the first thing that would come up to my head as her response. 



Me and her were limited to kissing, I couldn't have sex with her because its a pillow and (unlike cuddling) feels too off for me, and second of all, it'd make a mess making my pillow sticky and stinking up the room, and third of all it would look sad.



I've been a pornography addict for 2 years, and I've edged allot to pornography on my bed next to the pillows for some reason I felt that when hugging thr pillow, my girlfriend is angry at me for looking at other girls and doesn't want to cuddle with me. I kept telling the pillow ""you're not real"" and threw it around a bit but the illusion is still there. I could kill it but I'd feel her pain getting killed. Sometimes I'll remember that she's only in my head and she's not the pillow but that would just make me feel like she's everywhere with me (this development only happens today). Now I can't fantasize being in a romantic relationship with other girls because I can feel her existence inside of my mind.

241,"Hi everyone.

This day along with some others has been awful.

I get really panicked sometimes. I'd experienced things I won't go into detail about, but whenever something reminds me of it, I freak out.

My heart starts racing and I breathe really fast. Sometimes I experience dissociation. I feel horrible. I can't remember a lot of things prior to the events. They're just kind of gone. I hate that I have to think about this every single day. Not a day passes without me remembering. It just fills up, and it's ought to spill soon. I feel so alone in my struggles. The people around me seem so normal. I feel like an alien. Just the other day I felt like I was floating while I walked down the stairs because of some stupid trigger. Wasn't even related to anything, it was just fucking dumb.

Why did it have to be me? Why do I feel so bad?",11Sep2020,1
242,"Over the last year or two I have been experiencing some serious mental problems, it wasn't until recently that I realised its a problem. I have become extremely indecisive, I've started making large financial mistakes, I've been pushing away my partner and can't find joy in ANYTHING that I do, I can't play any video games or go for a walk or go camping or anything, I just find it to be a chore. But on top of all of that is simply anger, I don't understand where it is coming from, I can just be walking through the shops looking for a new shirt and all of a sudden, for no reason, I will just get so so so angry, to the point where I will punch myself in the leg as hard as I can, I am so frustrated and I am having frequent breakdowns, I cannot figure this out, I'm not even sure where to start looking. Any help anyone can offer me would be amazing, I feel like I'm going to lose so much if I can't figure this out.",11Sep2020,1
243,"I just completely broke down over the fact that the pharmacy I go to only has 27 Vyvanse pills so I will have to go to a different store to get that medication as well as my normal one to get my other meds. I'm sobbing and hyperventilating and have not had such an intense urge to end my life in years. I recently had to switch my insurance to a Medicaid plan and they want prior authorization for the Vyvanse even though I've been taking it for years. I've been calling and emailing my psychiatrist's office for over a week asking them to please do the prior authorization and they haven't done it and I ran out of pills so I have to buy it without insurance and it's going to be like $400. I feel I absolutely cannot just go without it because I started a new job a few weeks ago that I have started to struggle with and I absolutely need to be able to focus and perform at my best next week. I guess the job is a big contributor to how I'm feeling because I'm absolutely fucking terrified of getting fired. I can't accept the possibility. Rationally I know if I was fired I would have to just move forward and find another job but at this point I believe that I would kill myself if I lost this job. I have been struggling with severe mental illness since I was about 13 and I am 27 now. I managed to finally go to college when I was 23 or so and I just graduated in June. This is my first full time job and my first ""professional"" job. If I got fired the shame and anger and sadness would just be too much. I have tremendous social anxiety going out in public terrifies me. My regular pharmacy is fairly nearby, about a 10 minute walk. This other one I will have to go to is farther and I will have to take public transportation or an Uber or walk for about an hour and all of those options terrify me. 

I just feel like my experiences in life have shown me that I am unable to function in this society. There is something so wrong with the way I think or my brain and there is no fixing it. I just want it all to be over.",11Sep2020,1
244,"So, like i said, don't have Dissociative Identity Disorder. Wasn't traumatized when i was a child and always had a continuous consciousness 

HOWEVER

2 years ago i noticed my lucid dreams became... weird
Essencially, i started to notice my brain was starting to build a inner world for my lucid dreams. Actually, a inner solar system. Like, most lucid dreamers are vasically nomads. They hop throughout cenarious, be it by will or accident. Not me tho
In my inner world i have a room, just like my real room, but inside a house in the middle of the woods. But there's a basement in the inner world's room, which is basically a large room with a door in it's end. That door is where i can hop to different cenarious. The world, however, is immutable. I mean, i do have some powers, but I'm definitely not omnipotent, and i don't know what's going on with the, well, NPCs ""lives"".

So, is it normal? Because i NEVER heard something like this before",11Sep2020,1
245,"I know how silly that sounds, but when I was 11 some dude tried kidnapping me and dragging me into his white Jeep Wrangler. Thankfully some passerby’s got out and saved me. Beat this guy to a pulp. The guy killed him self in prison a few years ago. It’s been 11 years since then, and I’ve gotten over it, but whenever I’m on the road and I see a Jeep Wrangler, especially a white one, I get flashbacks and get scared a little, I broke up with my boyfriend because he bought a Jeep Wrangler when he knows they trigger flashbacks. Whenever I see one, especially a white one, I have a mini panic attack, Where I live there quiete common, so I try to avoid driving when I can. Is this a normal reaction, and honestly I want to get over this",11Sep2020,1
246,"Everything is so shit. My friends are both amazing and pieces of shit who insult anything they can about me, when they cant find anything else to talk about. I can't get away from them without be bullied to shit anyway and i still dont hate them because they are good friends most of the time. Lockdown was deppressing, School is even more deppressing. I dont have enough time to study for my exams and even if i did i dont have any motivation for some reason. Almost all my happiness comes from the media i consume. I have college next year. I dont know what i want to do with my life. I live in such a shit place i think my life is just going to get even more deppressing after i finish school. Like seriously, why is everyone around here druggies or working really shit minimum wage jobs they never get out of. Why am i so sad and deppressed all the time? Fuck me.",11Sep2020,1
247,"Well, the title basically explains it. I am 22F and My parents are constantly arguing with each other, everything is way too cramped and my mom has so many knick nacks and it is really messing with my head, I can never get comfortable, and making healthy meals is just a huge challenge because I hate my kitchen and there’s so much stuff around I feel like I can’t even cook. There is not one area of counter space that can even fit a cutting board to prepare food. 

On top of that, my mom has an awful smokers cough and I cannot handle it. It is so loud and echos the whole house and it is so disgusting and it is at least 4-5 times per hour. My mom also bullies me about so many things, such as my weariness of covid and always laughs at me whenever I say something she doesn’t agree with. For example, she was talking about having people over for thanksgiving and I suggested everyone get tested for covid before coming just to be extra safe and she laughed in my face saying it was a bad idea. That’s not the first time something like this has happened, and I told her it is rude and she knows that I don’t like it. My mom also has a phone addiction and spends her entire day on Facebook and mobile games. I told her so many times it upsets me and I feel like I’m not close with her cause she doesn’t make an effort with trying to spend time with me and she denies the fact she has a phone addiction and refuses to try new things. I feel closer to my boyfriends mom sometimes because she actually tries to spend time with me and talks to me about my day instead of just... not talking to me. Everyday, she wakes up, makes a bowl of cereal and spends time on her phone from 10 am to 12 at night, sitting in the same spot and (most days) does absolutely nothing productive. Don’t get me wrong, we are in a pandemic and it’s okay to be more unproductive right now. But she’s been doing this even before covid started, and honestly I just feel like she makes no effort to hang out with me or do anything beneficial for herself. I’ve tried so hard to help her find things she’s enjoys but just refuses it and gets so defensive and argues with me. 

I’m in school online this semester, and I had my first classes this week and all I heard while I was doing my lectures was her coughing and talking on the phone the occasional time. dealing with this while doing school is absolute shit cause I can’t escape her coughing like I normally do when I leave the house. 

I can’t even do my hobbies like baking and art because I don’t have enough counter space for baking. In terms of art, I need to relax and feel at  peace but in the background I can just hear her coughing and it triggers my anxiety, angers me, and I can’t stay relaxed. I even tried yoga but nope, she coughed and completely ruined my experience and broke my relaxation. I just feel like I cannot win no matter what I do. 

I’ve just had enough and can’t handle it anymore. I’m ready to move out and she knows that, but logically it makes no sense right now and won’t be ready to move out for another 2/3 years with my boyfriend. I just am so frustrated and annoyed. She treats me like a child and I feel like I am not an adult in her eyes, and she just always is arguing or barking at me over something so stupid. 

I lived at my boyfriends house for 4 months at the start of the pandemic and recently moved back home last month. I can’t handle it anymore and want to move back but I can’t ask to live there again and I know that I definitely overstayed my welcome. My boyfriend didn’t mind of course but his parents did, so I need to respect their wishes. 

I just don’t understand how I’m going to handle the rest of the pandemic without being able to comfortably leave the house and get the break I need from my family. I don’t know how I’m gonna handle doing lectures upstairs in my room and online coursework cause I’ll hear her cough and get instantly triggered. I just really feel so miserable and depressed and don’t know what to do. I can’t really talk to anyone about it and my boyfriend already knows how much it bothers me. Don’t get me wrong, I love my parents so much and they have done a lot from me. But now being an adult I am ready to spread my wings and live on my own. 

I just can’t win no matter what with life.",11Sep2020,1
248,"So I have this weird sleep cycle I was awake for like 30 hours then slept for 26 hours in this time I cleaned our living room room down a bed and put up a bunk bed.


Today I was disoriented and felt drunk (I had no alcohol) and felt faint after sleeping 26hours... I had a driving lesson and in it I just wanted to sleep so I kept messing up, I stalled 3 times... it was weird in the end I  stopped and told my instructor I wasn’t capable to drive 

I’ve had 3 nose bleeds in a week my chest hurts I can’t pee without forcing it with pain 

I chocked on food and had a cough for 2 weeks ( got checked for COVID (I was negative) I can barley breathe without pain sometimes but not always

My patent thinks it psychological (I tend to be an attention seeker) I contacted 111 and they said my GP would contact me when they didn’t I left it should I call again??",11Sep2020,1
249,"Hey everyone, firstly i would like to state that i am not a psyclogist or anything like that, Just her boyfriend.

250,"Since 2012 I’ve been suffering with anxiety, paranoia, depression, eating disorder and ptsd.

I’ve never talked to a professional or family about this because I’m introverted and I find it very hard to talk about my feelings face to face.

I’m usually able to control myself after a while but lately I feel like it’s all building up and I need to do something about it.

I do want to speak to a professional but I really could not open up to a stranger like that. I know it’s their job but I will hold back and keep parts in. I also can’t afford to see one. I just want some answers of what’s wrong with me and reassurance. 

Is there any other option or anyone who can talk to me? I really just have no one and I’ve been keeping it all in for the longest time.",11Sep2020,1
251,"I (27f) have been battling with anxiety for a long time. Over this last year it has gotten so severe that I didn’t think I would make it out alive. It’s like I live in fear for no reason. Everything around me screams DANGER! all the fucking time. I spiral into panic attacks on an almost daily basis. The panic attacks get so bad sometimes that I get suicidal and think the only way to make them stop is to not exist. My biggest issue is the fact that I cannot drive or get into a car without having an episode. It has caused me a lot of embarrassment and has burdened my life in so many ways. I slip into depression a lot because I can’t leave my house, but I get restless because I WANT to leave my house. 

I finally made it to see the doctor and he prescribed me Zoloft to start on a daily basis. I was really worried that it wasn’t going to make any difference and that I would have to live the rest of my life in mental agony.

Today I felt okay. I wouldn’t say great, but it was finally on the side of normal. I’m surprised because it’s only been a few days of taking them. 

This afternoon I walked down the street to the playground with my daughter. I felt the sunshine on my face. We picked dandelions and raced down the slides. We walked back home on the sidewalk as cars drove by on the road. 

When it was time to leave she told me she was hungry. I drove us to get some food for dinner. I had to put my car in park every time the line moved in the drive thru. Something about being surrounded by other vehicles was freaking me out a little.. BUT I did it. I drove into town and I drove back home and I made it out alive. I only had to pull over twice. I left my house. I gave my daughter a day of fun. I was able to participate. 

It was a good day.",11Sep2020,1
