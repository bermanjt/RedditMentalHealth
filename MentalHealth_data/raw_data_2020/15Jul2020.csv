0,"has anyone ever had one of these done? 

I know I have depression and anxiety and possibly some form of ADD, but I have never been diagnosed with anything specific out of these categories, and I'd really like to know more about what kind of brain I have. 

I struggle with daily motivation and always seem to be distracting myself from just being. Some days are better than others, I have pondered whether I am bipolar but I'm not certain because I only qualify for one or two of the symptoms. (if anybody knows about this please don't hesitate to correct me!)

I'm a bartender who works nights, so I don't have exactly the most fulfilling or active day to day life. First thing I do when I wake up is smoke a few  cigarettes and drink coffee, then I may run an errand if I have one, if not I will smoke a joint. Then I will try to write for a bit, usually my brain has so many ideas it can't even decipher what it wants to say or how. But I still try. Then I smoke another joint. Then I either take a nap or watch tv until it's time to go to work. On my better days, I will go for a run and workout or do yoga. I have a few friends, but now with the pandemic life has been extra lonely. I don't have much of a family, we are all kind of distanced from each other. I don't have a boyfriend, or anything close to it. It's hard to know what needs fixing with the chemicals in my brain  VS what needs fixing in my *lifestyle.* Does this make any sense?",15Jul2020,1

4,"I don’t know if this is the right subreddit but I feel this is the most appropriate place to talk about my thoughts 

After lockdown my state of mind just went downhill. I realized how much I might value a friend and maybe how little I matter to them. See social media shows me a bunch of videos of people who like live on the beach or adventurous places and spend all day with their friends just having fun and it makes me jealous and I feel like my teenage years are going to waste. Obviously life isn’t like social media but still it’s hard to see other people living your dream. I’m never any of my friends first options to hang out or anything. I have to invite people all the time if I want to do something because it just feels one sided. I just genuinely like to be outside with other people and just have adventures but nobody seems to share my passion, except a few friends. But I never ask those few friends because they won’t necessarily want to go with me. All of this has made me a lot sadder and just a negative vibe all around if that makes sense. I’m not self diagnosing depression because it’s not like I don’t do anything, I have swim practice and workout and other hobbies but my mood has been down a lot recently 
Is there any way I can try to make this feeling of regret dissapear?",15Jul2020,1
5,"My partner dumped me via text the other day. Told me I ""treated them perfectly, but they weren't ready"" and now they won't even talk to me. I've never loved a person so much. They were my best friend. I feel so empty and lost. None of my hobbies feel worth doing if I can't share them with the person I love, so I do nothing. The worst part is the loneliness. I just open my phone expecting a message from them, but no one messages me. I guess I'm curious if anyone knows of like a depression pen pal type of deal? Like meet people to talk to about your feelings. I'm looking into actual therapy, but it's expensive, and they're not gonna text you all day like a friend might. I just don't really have many friends either. Idk. I'm sorry. Doubt anyone not being paid wants to hear me bitch about my life. Probably a dumb question to begin with.",15Jul2020,2

7,"I do not feel depressed or sad, but not happy or almost no emotions at all. It has been like this for well over 3 years no, and I haven’t though mouch about it before. It was not before about 6 months ago i got a girfriend. We fit well together but I feel like I let her down. I feel like I can’t show excitement, and even when I try to ""fake"" the excitement it stops like I’m being choked when i do so. 

I haven’t really laughed anytime I can remember, and I haven’t been sad or cried even when I fell like i should be. I am not anxious or depressed and not shy either, but it is hard for me to participate in conversations, and if it is just me and any other person, it’s just extremely quiet. At family gatherings it feels a little akward as everyone jumps around superexcited and I stand there still having a hard time forcing a smile.

8,"Hi, all. I'm a lifelong anxiety-sufferer due to C-PTSD &amp; CEN (Childhood Emotional Neglect) who has been very reluctant to take prescriptions for my issues. Until now. So, I'm seeking people's experiences so that I have some ideas of what to discuss with a psychiatrist.

So, I'm starting to recognize more and more that so many aspects of what I thought were my personality, but am starting to come to understand as likely results of my trauma. E.g., terrible sleep, terrified of public speaking and potential rejection of possible mates, frantically keeping my mind busy for fear of the self-loathing that will arise if given space for it, alcohol dependence, incompetent finances out of fear, regular anxiety attacks, constant body pain - back in particular, inability to follow through on most anything, irritability, always being on edge. I've long naively hoped that I could dig myself out of the whole just through diligence, and worry that if I ever tried to come off the meds, that it could lead to suicidal ideation.

I've been doing a lot of other things in the past couple years that have lead to vast improvements: regular exercise including yoga, meditation, journaling, limiting alcohol intake, whole foods diet, supplements, kratom &amp; hydration, psychotherapy, and about to start EMDR (tomorrow - yay!) But I'm starting to realize that this all might not be enough. At least for the time being.

As my understanding is advancing I'm realizing just how deep the effects of my trauma have been, including struggling to follow through with my mental health goals due to a kind of scatterbrained lack of consistency, fear of failure, and fear of facing my trauma and getting healthy finally.

So, who here has found a medication that helps them deal with the deep-seated effects of trauma? What have you tried? What are the side-effects? Any additional info that would be helpful in my research?

Thanks for anyone that read that whole tome and any info that might come from it!",15Jul2020,1
9,"I've seen a lot of mental health posts on social media, as well as popular songs (Carry On by fun, and Keep On by Sasha Sloan), that carry the message ""If you're struggling, just keep going"", and I'm wondering how this sentiment helps people. I've been having a bad day so I put a Spotify Playlist on called ""mental health recovery"" to see if it could help, and I noticed the trend, and for me personally, I didn't feel like being told to ""just keep going"" when I feel emotionally exhausted made me feel any better.

I want to understand this better, hopefully in a way where the message could even benefit me when I start to feel down on myself, but if not for me, just to understand and empathize with others better.

Thanks, all. Much love!",15Jul2020,1

11,"Now that my schedule isn't as hectic and my mental health is pretty okay, I've been starting to dig deeper about where my depression and anxiety is stemming from with my therapist. My therapist suggested I look into codependency... while it's mostly used for romantic relationships, I could find some things relevant when it comes to how I interact with my students. I'm fully aware that mental health is on a spectrum, and I know loved ones who absolutely need medication to do daily activities (and it has less to do with circumstances). My symptoms are very mild, and I completely understand if you don't feel like reading a block text about where I am mentally. I'm doing OK and doing my best with self-care. This post might be more for myself.

Sometimes when my symptoms aren't amazing but manageable, I mentally talk to myself as if I'm my own student. I ask myself questions to get to the root of why I feel the way I do. It helps, but obviously I have a therapist for a reason.

A year ago, I attempted suicide and chickened out. I admitted myself to a nearby hospital. I surprised some close friends because I was always the type to give other people advice and kept a smile on my face. I took a sick leave before officially quitting my teaching position for a few months. I gave substitute teaching a try and luckily ended up accepting a teaching position at a school that I absolutely love (things could change depending on public funding, but that's a different issue). I also ended a 5-year romantic relationship and currently in a happy relationship. Changing circumstances made a huge difference in my mental health.

Prior to my first teaching job, I never had a therapist or took medication for my mental health. I can now tell I had depressive moods since childhood, but it was manageable. The school was clearly not a good fit for me. In retrospect, I can identify things that worsened my ability to self-care, grow as a teacher, and enjoy my career:

* The first principal's only feedback after criticism of poor behavior management was to attend more professional development (trainings). He was simply disappointed in teachers that didn't meet his expectations, but kids didn't really listen to him either. He rarely left his office. When I confided in him that I was really struggling, he said to just go to more trainings. 
* Deans were pissed off when you called them for behavior support. Sometimes they never came out of annoyance. Some deans were verbally abusive to misbehaving students and terrified even the brightest ones. One of the deans ended up getting arrested for hitting a student (outside of school). I taught one of the dean's son, and he was angry when I gave him consequences for misbehaving.
* School-wide consequences were inconsistent and unclear. Kids already knew that they would be pushed along to the next grade. This made enforcing discipline that much harder.
* The first principal was laid off (rumor was that he used funds for personal use). This actually revealed he was hiring non-licensed adults (who were also warned that they would be laid off if they didn't get licensed by a certain date.) This was a slap in the face as someone who worked hard to get her degree.
* I initially loved the new principal who kept pushing for positive changes for the kids, but she became more critical towards me when my depression got worse. She said that if teachers truly cared about the kids, they need to make that their top priority. She meant well. In a different school environment, I might've had a better relationship with her.
* Some veteran teachers yelled and scolded younger teachers in the hallways... in front of students.
* I got along with very very few colleagues. One of them happily transferred to a different school. My mental health became a wreck when my mentor and best friend changed careers. 
* There was attendance awards for teachers to be able to purchase more school supplies/books for themselves. I've experienced both sides, and I hated it. I either felt guilty for taking any days off or felt a lot of glares for purchasing extra books for my classroom.
* I switched to a teacher team my second year that I didn't mix with at all. The team leader scheduled herself in my classes once a week to ""support"" me. She pointed out everything that was wrong and told me what to do. I was actually starting to get colleagues commenting on how much I've improved, but she completely crushed my self-esteem. She later complained to my mentor that I didn't like her even though she was doing me a favor. 
* Staying and working late in the building was applauded. I felt guilty when I left right after the school day was over (even though I was taking work home).

I felt like a complete failure, but I was stuck. I couldn't find another school to work at, and I genuinely felt that perhaps this was the wrong profession for me. When things got easier inside the classroom, I rarely stepped out of my room. I didn't want to interact with other adults in the building. It became increasingly difficult to get out of bed and get on the train. I eventually had to depend on Xanax to calm myself. It was a matter of time until I just hated feeling like shit and walked to the edge of the train tracks. (I did not jump).

When I got out of the psychiatric ward, I took a few months enjoying myself. I was seriously looking into alternative careers, but my boyfriend at the time knew that I still felt passionate about teaching and helping others. I just didn't trust myself. I officially broke up with my ex before being a substitute teacher. He mentioned that my depression could be influencing my rash decisions, and I can agree with that. Taking a step back and focusing on my own needs made me realize that:

* My family and friends loved him and felt that we were perfect together. I didn't want to break that image. I didn't want my mom to get nervous about me potentially not getting married by breaking up in my late 20's. I'm not the most popular gal.
* I don't feel comfortable talking about everything with him because we have different values.
* I became way too dependent on him emotionally, and I resented myself for it. It became to a point that I felt that I couldn't do anything without him. 
* He compromised so much for me. Breaking up would completely crush him.

I still feel guilty for breaking up with him. He was willing to compromise even more for me. I chose a blank slate instead of working things out with him. I felt better post-breakup though, and I felt my confidence coming back little by little. I gradually applied to different schools. Subbing in the meantime was a game changer-- I saw different school cultures and classrooms. I also jumped into online dating and am now blessed with a boyfriend that still gave a thumbs up after I told him *everything*. 

I was overjoyed when I was hired by another school. Honestly, I did have *one* depressive episode, and I am aware that those things won't completely go away (at least not that easily). I absolutely loved working there though, and I hope that public schools won't be defunded to the point that I lose it. At least I know that this is what I want to do though. 

Based on my experiences and my therapy sessions, there's some things I am working on and figuring out:

* My confidence is largely dependent on what other people say to me. It's really difficult for me to really feel good about myself even when people don't say nice things about me.
* My therapist wants me to look into codependency. I am super compassionate towards my students, and I want to be needed. It starts to hurt my mental health when the guilt kicks in. I tend to blame myself when I fail to reach certain kids, or when my students are in so much emotional pain but I'm unable to heal them. My therapist said this would be a challenge if I become a mother. I take responsibility for things outside of my control.
* I still strongly feel that my purpose in life is to help people even if it means putting my needs to the side. I feel good being selfless. I like easing other people's emotional pain and letting them know I'm here for them.
* It took forever to break up with my ex because I felt he also needed me. I did not want to break him. He was not a bad person.
* I still have a hard time talking about childhood trauma with my therapist. I'm still making sense of it. My dad was abusive towards my mom, and I wanted to protect her. They are divorced now, and I live with my mom (who's a very strong person). I am still protective of her though. I don't know if that influences my current attitudes.
* I honestly told my current partner I appreciate that he's able to be an independent person outside of the relationship. He likes me, but I don't feel like he depends on me. I'm sometimes tempted to care for him, but there's no need-- and therefore, my current relationship hasn't impacted my ""codependency"" problem.
* Strangely enough, I do have confidence and pride in my work. I get very defensive when people dismiss teachers as glorified babysitters especially for those working in really challenging districts. I couldn't last at my first school, and I have 100% respect for people working in those types of schools. They need really strong and passionate educators.
* I've become much more outspoken at my current school. I'm more receptive of constructive feedback because it's genuine. There's a good exchange of resources and support. It feels good when my struggles are included in conversations of how schools can support the whole community.

Sorry for the super long post! I am currently off medications and taking online classes. I also continue therapy sessions over the phone. I'm a work in progress, but it's important to be selfish sometimes for your own mental health!",15Jul2020,1

13,"It’s going on for three years at this point. I think I have to give some background to help you understand my situation. 
#Background
I’m 21 yo and this all started on my last year of high-school (since I was 19). You don’t have to know everything but let’s just say it was a strict school.    

The year before was actually amazing. I felt really accomplished and successful in every field: in the studies I was second in my class and however very very good (the gap with the others was pretty big) and the same I felt in the sports and also socially I finally felt to blend in with the others (I’ve always been isolated even if I had my little group of friends, and also in that time and now I still am a ‘solitary’ person so I think it’s more a trait of my personality and not at all a symptom of anything).  

In the spring something started to change. As I really felt there wasn’t anything else to accomplish and as I felt (for kind of a stupid reason, but it’s more complicated than this) betrayed by the people closer to me I started to push everyone away from me, in a more or less drastic way. As this went going on I became close to less and less people until really remained only one.    
I think it’s worth saying this was a kind of school where we all lived togheter and that I’m bisexual and have known and accepted that since middle school but never stated it publicly. So with this friend I won’t go into details but I’ll say that he was into girls but I think he returned my feelings. So this is the time I lost control and pushed also him away. Other things happened but this is the time where I started having some crisis where I had to go away from everyone else to breathe and then start crying (I wasn’t really someone who cried, I knew it wasn’t wrong as a thing but or didn’t feel to do it or didn’t want to be weak in any way).    
So the summer came and it really passed away almost I didn’t notice it. However I had problems sleeping (at school I didn’t sleep a lot at night too but for other reasons) and I also think I started eating less.  

So school again at September and here is where things really went downhill. I started more and more laying around doing nothing and feeling bad. The best way I saw at myself was through the eyes of my friends: 
- they started to notice I was eating less and at some point insisted that I had to eat (one once said he didn’t notice I became herbivore bc he didn’t usually eat with me and I was only eating vegetables) 
- I previously used to watch movies and series on my laptop because I really enjoyed them and was kind of my trademark to do so even if something was due for the day after and I remember at this time one of them saying worried “you don’t even do that anymore”
- One of my closest one once said, as I was laying on a desk in class, that she thought I could have been depressed 
- The one I last rejected and for which felt something said it was like I was ‘degradating’ (don’t get it wrong, it was not in a bad way).    

My friends were really supportive, even if I was at some degree still pushing them away. At one point they also came in my room wanting to know what was happening and I ended up talking to a couple of them but couldn’t go over explaining my sexual orientation and what I felt for that friend. I also went to a psychologist we had there a couple of times but also couldn’t go over that.  

As for what was happening to me on the outside now that I think about it I think I reached my peak both physically and at school (I had the highest marks for a time and also won a prize at February).  

For what concerned me I felt dumber: I had to read a sentence multiple times to understand it and really felt like I couldn’t do some complex thinking I was able to do previously (this went down with the time and still haunts me).    
I also started working out even for several hours just in order to feel fatigue. I think it’s worth saying that I never accomplished fatigue and didn’t really feel either hunger, sleep or anything else. I just felt bad. I didn’t even feel pain after hours and days of exercising, and to me it was bc I was at the peak of physical condition. I also didn’t smell, only recently I have smelled my sweat again, along with a lot of other things of myself, and I don’t know if there was something wrong with me or it was just my nose.
##Conclusion
At this point nothing else comes to my mind just that I knew something wasn’t right and tried to fix it in different ways but nothing really worked and I thought it was a breakdown for all the effort I had put in the precedent period (seriously, I don’t know how I previously did and accomplished everything I did, at the time I just thought that those were my capacities and I could just do that but now I see that as inhuman).  

So to relax after graduation I went back home and restarted my life and tried to relax more, exercise less, enjoy video games and other things (and I really started enjoying that).    
Initially I had problems waking up and getting out of my bed but I’m getting better at it.  

Recently I also started enjoying reading again.
The only problem I still have with it it’s whit prolonged attention: I can’t read for long times and also tend to watch maximum 30 minutes episodes (mainly anime) even if I end up watching several of them.
#Problem
So it’s overall going better but I just feel it isn’t still right. My emotional status changes day by day and as I’m attending law school I struggle to study and focus.  

My overall problem it’s my memory. As I started talking with my old friends I noticed there were some things I didn’t remember, things from my past they would tell me and I could not remember, most of the times not even vaguely. At the beginning I thought it was normal since I went through some years of a completely different life and through some psychological distress but now not also I think it’s getting worse, it’s also becoming an impending problem for my future. As I can’t properly remember what I study it will affect my future and these ‘failures’ will affect my psychological status. So what can I do at this point?  

I know that probably I went through depression (and at some degree I’m still into it) since every time I read something regarding it I more and more identify myself into the symptoms. What pushed me to write this it’s actually that I read that memory loss was one of the symptoms.  

If your advice is to go to therapy: if you’re really assertive I might consider it but at the moment it’s not among the alternatives and, for personal reasons, I don’t think I will.  

I’m already regularly exercising, eating better and eating what I like (recently I have started having breakfast whit self-made pancakes and it’s really the best thing ever). I started watching tv and reading again and everything else.  

If something I feel lonely but that’s something that accompanied me for almost my whole life and also I don’t think there is an easy solution to that. Don’t get it wrong I have friends I just lack the right type of friend, someone I can deeply relate to.  

I don’t know maybe I’m making a big deal of something that isn’t worth such worrying but I just don’t feel right yet and I want to. Now that I have put it down I also feel kinda stupid because it seems so trivial and at this point I should just keep what I’m doing and wait for it to get better.  

As I said **my main problem is with memory** so if you could help just whit that I will be immensely grateful anyway.  

Honestly I don’t really know why I wrote the story of my life but I think it can be therapeutic by itself (I actually felt emotional in some points) and also I have a friend who is studying Psychology and hearing some cases he has studied of Freud I thought that adding my background story could be useful.    
Keep also in mind I didn’t include some events or details:
- to preserve my identity of the others surrounding me (I have also deleted something for this reason)
- because I didn’t think they were as important 
- because I didn’t remember them.  

Also English is not my mother language so if something it’s not clear I’m willing to further explain it.",15Jul2020,1

My “life” right now, isn’t even a life at all. I spend all of my days sitting in my bedroom alone, friendless and feeling sad, angry or numb.

 Right now I’m feeling sad and angry as usual but I just can’t bottle it up anymore, I need to tell someone.

 Nobody gives a f*ck how I feel, I don’t have anyone and I’m just a massive burden, wasting space.

 I used to study and be athletic but not anymore. I’ve given up, I’m useless right now. I’m such a disgrace. 

This has been building up for a long time. Throughout my life, my OCD and autism has chipped away at any sanity I had. 

I can barley function anymore. I have no motivation or confidence. I’ve always struggled with confidence in life but nowadays I can’t do anything without thoughts of self hate and intense anxiety. I can’t do anything right. My social skills are nonexistent, I can’t talk to people. I’m too weird, I wouldn’t want to bother others. I actually feel sorry for anyone who has to put up with me. Because of this, I’m friendless and alone. I feel so worthless, like I’m not worth sh*t. I don’t believe in myself, making it impossible to achieve anything, even basic tasks. I’m convinced I can’t even do simple things like brush my teeth right. My OCD is so distracting, I can’t concentrate. I’m constantly doing irrational compulsions instead of doing something productive. 

I couldn’t hate myself more. I’m a complete mess. I’m a hateful angry person, I’m afraid of what I’ll be like in a few years. I get worse every year, the pain just gets worse. 

There’s no way out of this, I’m tired of false hope and fairytales. I want to die, but since I can’t do anything right then of course I can’t do that either. I’m too afraid, I’m a coward about it. 

So to distract myself and in an attempt to bring myself some happiness I waste my life on my phone. My screen time is around 12 hours a day, everyday. I can’t really go wrong, it’s not like the real world. 

I’m going nowhere being like this but I can’t get out of this. Sometimes I just sit and think about suicide and it actually brings me happiness. Anything is better then what I’m doing now.

22,"**Trigger warning**

I was looking through my old iPad mini. Seeing if anything was worth saving before I sold it. 

I came across a lot of pictures of my stomach, food and Diaries talking about my journey of rapid exercising and starving myself. 

Most of this was at 12 but it all started when I was 10 because an adult called me fat. 

I’m 15 now and looking back I was just a little chubby, cuz I was a kid. But my mind was so broken then. 

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/AbQ8Ymy) is one of the pictures. I was 13 in this photo.

You see the little bit of fat poking out of the waistband? I cried over that. 

I would make hundreds of videos on my iPad of me just standing up and turning around so I knew what I looked like from all angles, it’s a habit I still have before I go out somewhere. but I delete the videos after. 

I just want to let every adult know to never call a child fat or ugly. Because it seriously impacted my mental health. My entire family has had a history of suicidal thoughts, depression. Anorexic etc. But I would have never become so aware about my body if that Adult hadn’t said I was fat.

I suspect these 2 have engaged in having sexual intercourse. I don’t think it’s gone as far as I have suspected, but nonetheless it happened or was lied about. 

He’s also listened to this person lies when I wasn’t around, off the clock from his job as a lawyer? Which means... I’ve recently found out that he has a GF/fiancée who has a child of her own but I believe he’s lied once about the child being his. Its been a year since I’ve accidentally ran into this girl so she should still be in his life because i heard she wanted to be with him but she was just as messed up as he was for what she also did to me, and I didn’t know her. 

His parents as well as I are worried about him. He’s not himself to his parents and the fact he has sex with my family member who’s my relative isn’t okay as well as admitting to wanting to murder someone? Which he’s then turned around and said wasn’t true. 


My relative (59) fed this (25) year old lies and he didn’t even check to see if it was true or not. Why would a 25 year old mess with my aunt who’s almost 60? Doesn’t society shame this? 

Can someone tell me what they should do and I should do? I’m afraid he’s just losing it because he thinks she knows me when she doesn’t. Everyone is looking at me ultimately to send him to jail also because of what he’s done to me.",15Jul2020,0
24,"I am from a middle eastern country. I was diagnosed by inattentive ADHD 5 by 5 different psychiatrists from 4 different countries, but that is besides the point. After graduating highschool, I decided to continue university in Russia. I had absolutely NO idea that all ADHD medications are illegal here under all circumstances. I only learned about this after a year and a half of learning Russian to a good enough level to which I can read, speak, and think in it given that information concerning living in Russia with ADHD is only available in Russian. Before, I thought that I can bring my medications from my home country with a legal prescription as in most European countries, but in Russia there is no such thing. Consuming and buying Ritalin and Vyvanse is as big of a crime as abusing heroine here, which can land a person 7 years in prison. Despite how difficult it was, I managed to pull through and passed the entrance exams for medical school here, but I cant realistically continue like this. This was all a big mistake. Knowing Russian now is nice, but I spent two years of my life for nothing. Before corona hit, I was accepted to study in Spain, but that didnt work out in the end for obvious reasons. After that, I applied to a couple universities within the EU, and it didnt work out in the end. On top of that, I have no idea where my highschool diploma is since I sent it to my home country via a Russian post office to fulfill requirements to apply for EU universities. Things been stuck in Moscow 3 weeks now. Now, my only choice is to go back to my home country and prepare again on my own, and redo the SATS and TOEFL. Is that wise? What should I do?

An Attempt to Save Yourself

July 12th, 2020

This was a “spur of the moment” decision. Seems like I have a lot of these moments. Well, because I do. I go through my hoard of stuff from time to time and just find my ramblings written across random old journals. Never did I find one with more than one entry, that changes today. (That sounds so determined, but fuck it i’m sure i’ll skip this like all the others.) I want this to be a rather *critical log of my thoughts* moving forward.

I often think “Okay why is it such a big deal if I do X or think like Y. Tons of people do (this) with no fucks given, so why am I being harsh on myself?”

While I feel like this is a very healthy (To an extent) mindset, I also think about the things i’m doing that make me feel this constant guilt. Most of which are not considered “healthy” or “mature” actions. *Relativity is so important, yet impossible to truly pin down.*

So, I think this might be where the root of my constant inner conflict and unpredictable outer nature comes from. Think of these 2 examples. Try and break them down. One, more concrete and obvious while one is more, challenging, involving a more direct conflict of emotion. Example 1. Everytime I go to the gas station to buy a pack of vape pods, I feel judged. I appear and hold to this kind, friendly and good kid demeanor and then I ask the clerk “Yea, can I also get the menthol pod, 2.4 nicotine.” immediately I feel like less of a man. Maybe it’s because i’ve half-convinced myself for years that I WANT to quit. Or maybe because it’s for me and a proper man shouldn’t need this nicotine crutch. Or maybe it’s because I told my Ex, that I would &amp; did quit, but just began hiding it instead. Well… I guess realistically it's all those things. But then, something happens. I just get this feeling of.. “fuck it.” I want to vape so i’m going to do it. And then the cycle repeats.

For this second example, I should probably write the backstory associated with it. I loved my best friend for always, until she caved and we got together. Things didn’t work out. But I felt tethered to her. I was always anxious or depressed when I wasn’t with her. So screw it, I’ll stick around. Years pass and I remain single. No crippling anxiety. No fucks given. Interested and focused in my career. That’s when I made the connection. My anxiety and depressive feelings were always centered around her. Thoughts like “What’s she doing right now?”, “What does she see in this fuckboy… He’s going to hurt her.”, “She makes me feel so warm, how will I live a content life if we can’t remain together?” So without her in the picture, I was confident. Successful. While the depressive habits would creep in from time to time, they were always manageable. Now here we are. 2 months post-break up from a different girl I've dated for nearly a year. From the start, my mind has been in a whirlwind. We would click and be great, then weirdness. Next comes discomfort. Then a break. And repeat. Was it love? We were so different emotionally at least, but the same in a lot of ways. She would do lots of inconsiderate things, I would get hurt, then upset and either lash out or become reserved and uncomfortable to be around. A month passes after our actual break up with no communication really. The first week was hard, but I'm no stranger to numbing my feelings. Next couple weeks i’m filled with confidence and hope. BOOM. Depressive brick wall. I think about all the things I did that were really hurtful or inconsiderate, things that I’d get so defensive over at the time. I reach out to her. (Hey, you know how this road goes. If you gush your feelings, it’s really over. You know that right…?) I don’t care. I cannot keep this in. \*A heartfelt message returned with a comforting denial.\* (You know she’s just saying that to make you feel better right…?) Yeah, but what’s so wrong with that…? You keep talking. Frequently at this point. Feels like years ago… Like i’ve learned no lesson. I was a confident but defensive guy in our relationship. Isn’t that a contradiction..? Oh well. But now I just “simp” because the conversation is good. We click without the drama of romance. (Okay but you still want to be with her…) But I start realizing things. Why did I take some jokes so seriously before, when now they have me rolling in laughter? Was it love? Can I love? Or do I obsess…? Even now, she’ll hint at being jealous about me casually talking with a girl, or hint that she’s lonely and wants some company.

Here’s example #2 of your inner conflict (As if that wasn’t enough baggage already dude.) Is it bad to “Simp?” To have so much care and desire to give someone anything they could need, even if they don’t give that much back? Of course, thats a subjective statement. She would and does give a lot back, but is it to the same degree that I consider my own involvement BUT ALSO why should that even fucking matter? But then I think, KING get out there and get shit done! Screw these women, you do you. And I do. I feel the confidence, the pep in my step, even if just for a day or two. People notice. Girls notice. She notices.

How do I become a “Simp King.” How. How do I maintain healthy confidence, where I can brush off a joke and laugh back but also give anything and everything for someone…

I think many of my love issues spark from my inner ashamedness/hate of myself. Should I stop doing these things that make me feel ashamed, or can I just own them without caring? I’m worried in doing so, I would be the fool and not the King…

**Below is a list of things I do even though i’m ashamed. Imma just be brutally honest with myself here.**

* I Drink, Like ⅓ a bottle a night. Usually alone, and I don’t tell anyone when I have.
* I Vape. I am fully addicted. I don’t see any gain here, but I don’t really care enough to stop.
* I leave my room a mess, cleaning it maybe once a week.
* I Neglect my pet lizards. I provide the absolute bare minimum care and I hate that…
* I'm too uncomfortable to make use of the rest of the house (I’m a 24-year-old living in my grandparent's basement ffs)
   * Idk why. I know they don’t mind, I just don’t want the interaction.
   * I will pee in a jug, just because I don’t want to go out into the bathroom if my grandpa is there…
* I don’t reply to friends or family, randomly.
* I eat in my bed &amp; leave the dishes all over until I finally clean up.
* I invest time, money and effort into making masturbation more realistic
   * I’ve tried to sew a “pillow” in order to replicate an ass.
   * I use a fleshlight in different scenarios to simulate sex positions, etc.
* I take viagra sometimes just to get a good masturbation session.
   * I occasionally took it before seeing my ex, hoping we would have a great time (Rarely happened anyways…) And I never told her.
* I drop food or drink on the carpet and rarely give a shit unless it’s a pretty bad spill.
* I only brush my teeth when I remember/care too… (3x a week?)
* I’ll waste a whole day watching youtube if i’m not feeling productive.
* I drink a lot of caffeine (3+ red bulls a day)
* I will eat out for almost every meal and the meals i make at home are pretty easy and unhealthy.
* I rely on the Adderall i’ve been prescribed to get stuff done. While it changed my life for the better, I feel like it’s made me a less *real* person and idk if I like that.
* I tell everybody i’m going to take my GRE soon, and I haven’t even checked the testing dates… Why. I just… I don’t feel driven too. Fuck.

Well damn. That’s quite a list… I don’t like any of it. I don’t want anyone to see any of it… How do I change? Some of these make me happy on a “guilty pleasure” level, is that so wrong? Probably not, but there’s a lot here… Lmao. I just feel like a live a double life. The life of sin I need in order to give everyone the life of joy, positivity, and energy that I genuinely have when i’m around them. No one could know this shit. Would telling anyone help? I don't know. I’d rather just tackle them one by one and make myself a better person. Is this why I couldn’t love? Even to those that mean the world to me, I still live a life of lies behind them…

Perhaps I’m a psychopath? I mean, I read other people very well. But no… I’m low-key too emotional haha and at the very least I can sympathize with people’s pain. Idk. Hopefully, this journal will help me figure out.

I just want to be a better man, I just don’t know where to begin

26,"Let me explain. Ever since I was in kindergarten, I have always had this sense/mental image of all of my close friends and family, sitting in one room together, watching me and my every move on multiple televisions. As if there were hundreds of surveillance cameras all around me at all angles, showing my every move to said friends and family. Its like, I can be washing dishes, right, but in my head I can see myself washing dishes as if i were standing right next to myself. or behind myself. or even above myself, looking down. basically i can ""see"" myself all around and in turn, my friends and family sees me from all around too, via the television surveillance. They watch me and they have BEEN watching me since I was 5 or 6. And they all talk to each other about me, positively or negatively. And its just something I've always lived with. However, I know fully well that this is insane and this is not happening at all, but no matter how hard I try i cannot make myself stop ""thinking"" about it, if I try, one of ""them"" always says something like ""look she's trying to get rid of us again, it isnt going to work"". Please, I know how crazy this makes me sound. I know. I just dont know what this is and if anyone could at least tell me what might be wrong with me it would help me so much. I dont want to feel or think this way anymore. To be clear, I have good relationships with my family and friends, I dont think anyone is out to get me. I just constantly think that I'm being watched and idk what to do anymore so I figured I'd make a post here. I dont want to explain this to a therapist and have them
lock me up somewhere.",15Jul2020,1
27,"I'm 15 trying to figure myself out. I get sexually arroused by literally everything from the opposite gender that has a butthole. Animals, old women, girls my age. Everything.

Anyways, I also get aroused by children (mostly over 12). And that surprised me. Surprised me so much in fact that I went through a severe depression for some days. Took anti depressiants and they helped. Anyways, lately I can't look at children without getting this butterfly-in-my-stomach feeling. And I don't know if that's because of arousal or anxiety of being aroused. 

The thing is, I usually don't get the ""intrusive thoughts"" that comes with POCD whenever I see a child. But sometimes I do and I try to convince myself that it's just hormones and puberty. It usually goes away but not always. 

I haven't talked to a therapist yet, since my appointment is in 1 month due to her going on vacation. 

I just want to know if this is because I'm still confused about myself or because I have POCD. 
Thank you.",15Jul2020,1

I’m super proud of how todays video turned out (I cried watching it back) but before you watch, read some of the thoughts I have: 

As “adults”, we have to unlearn most of what society piled on top of us as kids. The things that made us feel broken, unseen, undervalued, unloved, unworthy etc. The things, that made us see ugliness and not beauty in every living thing. 

The older my physical body gets the more I have to “unlearn” and expand my mind. I strive to “unlearn” at least one thing a day, to heal the inner child. 

What are you unlearning today? Where do your beliefs come from? Do your current beliefs and systems support your mental health? Is everything in your life in alignment with your eternal soul? Do you believe everything to be true to yourself? Or do you believe it because it’s what you’ve been told? 

If you’ve ever felt lost, misunderstood, purposeless, I have a new YouTube video out that might help. 

I hope you Subscribe, (its free to you, and helps Youtube algorithm push out my videos) Like, Share 💕💕💕

Let me know in the comments what you are unlearning today?

29,From past experiences I've shut them out or distanced my self from them. I don't know why I feel this way does anyone have a clue?  I feel like it kinda became a sort of trauma that hold me back from making anymore friends cuz I feel like I'll only hurt people so the best thing I could do is keep them away from my self. But I'm very lonely and really need ppl who I could express my self to and who would love me but I feel like id never be able to return the love they'd give me more so I'd never forgive my self for hurting or upsetting them so I just let my self suffer and not hurt anyone else.

Fireworks, and loud/sudden noises are huge triggers for me and I don’t know why. It makes no sense, I know I’m safe, and I feel so stupid. I can’t even hold a sprinkler or shoot those little parachute solders with my little cousins and grandparents. Not even the loud ones anymore, even the ones that just spark. I’m missing out on what little quality time I have with them because we live many states apart, but I can’t bring myself to even go outside. I lasted maybe five minutes.

I feel an absolute loss of hope and motivation for everything. But I cant just do nothing and wait for it to end unless if I were to actually end my life but I dont have the nerve for that and to die sooner is the last thing I want. If I dont want to die yet everything feels pointless, I cant figure out what there is to do and how I can get over this feeling. I just want this suffering to end.

I'm tired of medication and therapists being so incredibly expensive. Theres no way I can get any help anytime soon because of it.

So I'm adopted and my mom is driving me fucking crazy. she always is pressuring me to cut my hair and dress differently and if I don't comply, she gets very upset. She's tried to keep me from seeing my birth mom multiple times, by saying that if I don't do well enough in school or I don't do something specific I won't get to see her. I personally think it's very fucked up to do that but I've been told it's not a big deal. She has a bad way of handling certain things and sometimes tries to have uncomfortable talks with me that make me uncomfortable. I've made a lot of mistakes in my life that could get me in trouble and I regret everything I did. I have been in a toxic relationship for years and it's been devestating on my mental health. I've made plans to kill myself before and she found pills in my room and she tried locking up all the razors and knifes so I wouldn't harm myself but it didn't work because I did it again not too long ago.

He approached me on the street after I had been drinking. He was 30 and I was 19 and separated me from my friend. Once we got back to his place, he started violently kissing me. He forced me to undress, bit my breast, suffocated me with his body, pinned my leg down with his knee, and told me to perform sexual acts on him before vaginally penetrating me until I started bleeding. He didn’t stop when I was bleeding and kept going. I dissociated the entire time.

He made a lot of degrading comments and forced me to tell him what I wanted him to do to me. He tried to take pictures of me, yelled at me when I tried to leave, and forced me to sing for him knowing that I was studying voice in school at the time.

41,"Hello! So I’m a 17 year old girl and I have diagnosed GAD, emetophobia, OCD, and a panic disorder. I began taking antidepressants in late January and they have worked great, I went from having 10 panic attacks a day to 1. My anxiety HAS increased recently but that’s most likely due to the general chaos of the world right now, as well as the fact that I’m in a transitional period since I graduated high school last month. I do have a question regarding my mental health though.

Recently, I have been feeling very bored. Not just bored like “there’s nothing to do” bored — I just don’t see much excitement or opportunity in life. It’s strange because I’m attending college in the fall and I have a lot of things going for me, but I just don’t feel excited or like life is very special anymore. I’m not sure if it’s because of the quarantine or something but I’ve been feeling this way for a while. I also have had a strong lack of motivation that might also be due to quarantine as well, but I’m not sure.

I know this can be a symptom of depression, and normally I’d discuss it with my therapist as I know anxiety and depression often go hand-in-hand, but 1) depression doesn’t really run in my family and 2) otherwise i’m a generally happy person. I smile and laugh a lot, I sing along to music, and I love playing with my dog. I exercise every day.

I’m not asking for a group of strangers to diagnose me, but I’m just wondering what your take is and whether I should bring this up to my therapist. I’m really scared that I do have depression, but it might just be me overthinking as I do that a lot haha.

42,"Will try not to go into too much detail.
My childhood was a nightmare the likes of a gut wrenchingly tearful movie.
I have no faith, I do not have a connection with anything, not even spiritual. I feel numb.
Nothing ever matters.
Sometimes I find a muse in helping others, but it quickly passes when I find everyone just uses me.
Without helping others I'm never around anyone, aside from work that is.
Also relating with others has never been possible, I'm fundamentally different from the lifetime's worth of people I've met along the way.

Work helps me pass the days, months, years, etc..
Basically I have no logical reason to exist.
I have exhausted all options presented to me in life. Nothing brings me to a place where I feel a connection to life.
Going back to the whole faith and spiritual part, I nearly obsess with the idea of killing myself.
I'm not going to do it soon, I just know I'm headed towards it, just a matter of time.
I will not burden anyone with my checkout at that time, don't worry.
I am not looking to be talked out of the idea, but rather looking for some insight I've never seen,  maybe I'm missing something?

Is there some magical explanation to people living out a fulfilled life, is it all a big lie everyone tells themselves and eventually come to believe in the end?

I’m going to yell at my kids because he’s not answering. I’ll call him repeatedly until he blocks me. Then I spend all night unable to breathe just praying to God that he’s alive. 
When he’s done, he will call me and tell me I’m crazy and we will fight until I can’t fight anymore and I just forgive him because it’s easier to pretend it didn’t happen. 
But I’m spiraling now. 
It’s just getting worse. 
But I see clearer now, I can see how our kids are suffering. 
I can see why i have so much anger for him. 
I know it’s because I have no control over my life and what happens to it and i can’t help my kids if something happens to him. 
So am I getting better? Or am I getting worse? 
Was I as bad as he told me I was and I just didn’t know it?

But these thoughts. These thoughts are getting darker. And they don’t stop. They just loop and loop and loop and I obsess over them until I finally pass out. 
These thoughts are new. They aren’t about him. 

I’m suddenly terrified of the tree in my yard. 
My kids aren’t allowed to be in the back part of the house. 
It’s going to come down on the house I know it. 
And the driveway. It’s sinking. And I check it everyday and it’s just getting worse. And I’m consumed. I’m consumed of thoughts of a sinkhole swallowing ya so deep into the earth that no one can reach us. 
But we don’t die. 
No my brain wants to make me suffer by giving me visions of us buried in rubble and all I can hear are my kids screaming in pain and fear for days on end until we all die. For hours and hours these thoughts consume me. 

I couldn’t even do the dishes tonight because I know if I went near the sink I would turn the garbage disposal on and what if o just stuck my hand in there?
And at night I don’t sleep because I’m checking to make sure it’s unplugged every twenty minutes because what if my four year old climbs in the sink while everyone is asleep. 

These thoughts consume me. Paralyze next. There’s no room for anything else. The kids want to play but everything is so dark and these thoughts just won’t give me a break. 
But then they do. 

And then I spend the rest of the night thinking about how I’m failing my kids and I need to be better and I need to get up and call my doctor. But I won’t. Because I can’t. Because my brain fucking hates me and I just can’t get out of bed.

I’ve always dealt with low self esteem and low confidence since elementary days and it got worse during my junior year in high school not to mention also in college. 

I’ve always considered cosmetic surgery. However, my family would disowned me despite that I’m doing this in order for me to at least feel beautiful and regain my self confidence as I also have a strong negative perception about my body (in other words worse body image if that makes sense)

I'm an operator and when logging an incident today, my boss (it can't be good that he's said something) made a comment about my report saying that I did well to cover myself and include all documents to show why something wasnt done right.

As soon as I realised this, I'm thinking back on all other times I've done this without knowing it at the time - no matter how small the incident and both work and personal related. I automatically overexplain myself and cover all bases, I think in a way to avoid responsibility. I don't even know if I'm explaining this right.

These days it seems like I can't watch a youtube video and enjoy it, my mind is elsewhere just constantly in a bad mood. It seems as now I am back at square one and I don't want to be because I have made alot of progress and I am not about to have it go to waste.

61,"Okay, so this post was originally meant for the teenagers sub, but I decided to post it here.

Before I start I want to say that Im 15 and I have some issues with mental health. Im very emotional a lot of the time and kinda unstable. Im not mentaly unstable to the point where I would snap and do something crazy but my mind is just a crazy mess now. I dont think I have any mental disorders even tho there is possibility for that. I wont explain the whole thing because Im not doing this post for that. I heard that your head can be a mess in puberty and it probably is because of that but I never imagined it could be such a mess and here is one reason why:

I finished elementary school this year. Idk how school system works where you are from but here there is kindergarden to age ~6 then middle/elementary/primary school from ages ~6 to ~15, then 4 years of high school and then college. You can also go to high school for 5 years but then you cant go to college. The last four years we had these presentations about puberty and other things like that. About 1-3 per year. They were presented by people who work in places where they work with that kinda things like teens and stuff I dont really know but they are specialized in that kinda things. It was fun having these presentations. They talked aboult all kinda things that can happen in puberty or in everyday life like on the internet for example. But they almost never mentioned mental health. All they mentioned is that we might get more emotional and that we might fight with our parents a lot or that we might feel ""more rebellious"" and that we will need friends if that counts as something because I think it has to do with mental health. They did a good job with other stuff but all Im saying is that schoold dont talk enough about mental health issues or mental health in general. Idk we'll see how will my high school be about that next year.

 Im still learning about mental health so if anyone know anything about mental health in puberty or think that it could be something else or just anything feel free to share. 

Im sorry for all the grammar mistakes.

Stay safe everyone and have a great week. Bye :)

I don’t feel anything from doing anything anymore. Nothing inspires me or makes want to keep going on in life, there’s no reason for me to keep on living it feels like everyone is done with me by this point. I really don’t care but isolating so much for the past couple of years has made me think so much about everything and now I just feel empty and dead inside. I wanna say I’m happy about hanging out with friends or happy that my puppy is healthy but it doesn’t feel like any of those things will ever happen because I don’t think I’m in the position to care about anything anymore. The only thing I do in life is waste time. I am completely drained by everything and it feels like there will never be a reason for me to keep on living. I don’t wanna kill myself just yet because I’m afraid of it getting better and don’t wanna lose an opportunity for my life to be fixed but that glimpse of hope is slowly fading away and having that as the only thing keeping me alive isn’t gonna do much when things get much worse. I am really in no position to complain, my life was looking good but I don’t know what happened, everything just disappeared, my friends, family, and overall human connection which has just put me into a complete state of denial. I don’t think life is worth anything because even if I find happiness and build a life for myself it will inevitably end and disappear as I take my last breathe. I’m just warped in an entire feeling of nothingness that is not going away anytime soon and I don’t think anyone will ever be able to fix that and make me function with purpose again.

72,"today i went to the lake with a close friend. we ordered sushi, drank red bull, sunbathed, and bought some tea at target. it was fun and all, but all of a sudden i got this overwhelming feeling in my head and chest. a heavy pressure. a bunch of thoughts flooded in at once. 

my relationship with my dad is unhealthy and i don’t think it’s fixable anymore.his comments about my body, he’s manipulative, his mental state even makes me feel more depressed, and still hasn’t recovered from his divorce in 10 years ago and still makes me feel horrible about it.

my future. it seems so far and difficult. i graduate in 5 months and i have no clue what i’ll be doing afterwards. i don’t know what to do with my life. i don’t feel i’ll be successful.

my boyfriend. sometimes i feel like i’m not getting what i need, but i want to work everything out with him. i’m feeling sad now, he went to sleep, and i wish he would stay up with me a little longer or at least try to help me feel better. but he wakes early for work so i feel bad keeping him up. it’s hard to vent to him. he’s never had problems with depression or anxiety. he’s a very determined and hardworking guy, and i respect him for that.

i wish i had my own source of income to buy those paintbrushes or new fabric for my embroidery, or that body scrub that smells like vanilla cupcakes. you know, to treat yourself a little bit. i want a job to keep busy, but with the recent corona spikes it’s very difficult to find a job— especially in a small town.

i might be having to get rid of my two month kitten because the smell is too overwhelming. he’s my pride and joy and my parents think one cat is enough. i’m trying to find solutions like baking soda and other deodorizers but i haven’t found anything yet.

i have frequent utis. every other week. i wish i was kidding. i finally got a referral to go to a urologist but continuously having these infections make my heart sink to my stomach. the pain and uncomfortable is simply too much.

75,"I have been struggling with depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, low self esteem, etc.. for years and in the last 3-4 yrs i have probably seen over 10 different counselors/therapists (forget what is what at this point they all feel like the same really) but i have never really left a session once thinking that this person is actually guiding me towards a better me as my life keeps spiraling down and out of control.. it sometimes just seems like they all have that sales pitch you see in scammy ads where they egg on about eventually showing you the ways to get better then when the fund dry up or my free sessions are soon to end they just tell me we can't get to where we need to go unless i keep seeing them. But all i feel is like i'm paying 120$ to be told see you next week.

At this point i'm willing to even drop 300$ per session if i see a therapist that actually asks and engages with my situation and can help me bounce from this eternal dread.

I'm just tired of investing so much money and time into the wrong therapist who says pretty little things until i catch that we aren't going anywhere.

To anyone that has found success with a therapist/counselor, how did you know it was a good fit? any advice to someone who hasn't found a good fit?

I think personally, i always expected that if you're paying for the service it's because you're essentially going in saying ""look somethings fucking wrong with me but i don't know what/how/why it is, please help me fix it"" but i'm never found with a supportive counselor like that. I thought the very least they're meant to do is probe right? too many times i'm left at awkward pauses because i don't know what to talk about and they don't ask me a damn thing. I was raised in an emotionally abusive household where i was raised to hide and not acknowledge any of my problems but yet you expect me to know how to convey these problems for the first time to total stranger randomly? that's why i'm here in the first place!

Im 17F and have usually been a very emotional person.  All through high school I would be the first person to cry during a movie, and I’d always empathize with others. Then, 2020 hit. My mental health began to crumble and I was diagnosed with Pure O OCD. My OCD obsession is that I believe that I might be a sociopath. I‘ve had good weeks and bad weeks since January, but this obsession has stemmed from my recent lack of emotion. For some reason, I feel like my emotions have turned themselves off. I don’t feel sad. I don’t feel happy. I don’t feel empathy for others. Hell, I don’t even feel fear anymore. 

My therapist attributes this feeling to depression, which I disagree with. I have been depressed before, and this is not how I experienced it in the past. I dont experience the typical symptoms of depression like loss of appetite (although food has lost its taste now) and trouble sleeping. I feel myself pulling away from friends, though. 

I guess my question is how do I bring up lost emotions again? Could I have turned into a sociopath? Everyone Ive asked for reassurance from says no, but I don’t know what caused this complete shut off of emotion. Thanks for any and all advice, and Im happy to answer more questions.",15Jul2020,3

I can’t even say hi back to people and whenever I try to make conversation I can just see the disappointment or confusion in their eyes and I die inside a little. I see wonderful people around me just pass by my life because I don’t know how to establish relationships. 

But no one points it out or thinks I need help because I go to a renowned uni and do well in grades. People just think I’m weird or “quirky” when in reality I’m just broken and malfunctioning.

My parents think I can do things on my own, that I figured out most things I need when in reality it’s completely opposite. I have no direction in my life.

And I have no one to talk to about it. I have very few friends and they are all suffering from mental health issue, probably way more severe than mine and they simply don’t have space in their heart to listen to or care about my problems. I can’t tell my parents either. When mom found out I was seeing psychiatrist and taking medication she was heartbroken and acted extra careful around me which made me feel even worse.

Then it was will I graduate from college? Then it was will I find a job after college? Then it was will I keep this job? Now my job will become obsolete October 1, so now my new worry is will I find another job? Another worry is will I be able to make as much as I did before? &amp; it’s not even just jobs that worry me.

Oh someone killed a baby bear in my neighborhood. Oh a whale was found died choking on plastic. It doesn’t stop. I want it to stop.

95,"Hi, I'm a 23 year old student currently doing a final internship to graduate my Human Resource Management bachelor. My bachelors usually takes 4 years but I'm now in my 6th year, also due to a gap year. After that gap year I felt great and finished with good grades. But ever since I started my final internship in February I've been extremely unsure about myself. 

I have been struggling with my mental health since high school, I was bullied for 2 years which severly damaged my self esteem. Right now I don't feel confident whatsoever that I'm going to graduate in October. I'm having light panic attacks whenever I go to the office, not being able to be productive and constantly thinking about the worst case scenarios. 

Worst of all is that currently my therapist and my coach (every student at my college is assigned one) are both on vacation so I can't speak to them untill mid August. I want to speak to the person at my internship who manages/mentors me about the whole situation (she knows a little and we already decided to cut worktime from 5 days a week to 3) but I'm worried that she is fed up with my issues and that I come off as unprofessional and lose my internship. On the one hand I would'nt even mind starting all over again at a different company but on the other hand that would mean that I failed again, have to spend more money paying for my degree, etc.  I'm so close to my diploma but totally does'nt feel like it. I feel that I'm on my own, my fantastic GF tries very hard to console me but it's like she doesnt really understand (which I get, it's so complicated, for me too).

Right now I'm in the office, not knowing whether to stay or just go home and give up. I feel nauseous just thinking about doing the work that I have to do. I can't trust myself that tomorrow is going to be a better day and I don't know what to do.

101,"I’ve been in a near-crisis state for awhile now and I feel like part of me logically knows that I need to find some sort of professional help, but I’ve had such bad experiences trying to seek mental health care that I’m honestly a little bit cynical about it and also just scared. 


My first experiences with “therapy” were when I was in middle school and made the mistake of posting dance videos on YouTube, which lead to me being in contact with a lot of predators and my laptop being confiscated by the police when they found out. I had a couple mandatory meetings with a psychiatrist and they were just... weird. I had a lot of issues with my mom and whenever this came up he would always steer the topic towards intrusive questions about my moms sex life, to which I had no answer, but he would press. He went as far as to ask me if she was a prostitute, which he had no reason to believe, except for maybe wishful thinking (my mom was fairly young and very conventionally attractive). I would also refer to some of the men who talked to me as pedophiles, which would make him get annoyed and correct me about the distinction between pedophile/hebephile/ephebephile which I guess was valid, but I was calling them pedophiles as a way to express my disgust, obviously not as a diagnosis (I was 12/13) and as a kid with an interest in psychology, he kinda made me feel really stupid with the way he went about it. Anyway I was just not comfortable speaking with him for a variety of reasons and I was pretty happy when my sessions with him were up and I moved on to a family therapist instead. So I had my first session with the therapist, and when going over the basics of recounting what had brought me there, she was just incredibly rude to me over seemingly everything. She outright accused me of lying a few times over stupid things, one of which was my follower count on YouTube (which was like 1000 or something not even something unreasonable). Thankfully my mom was there for that session and knew I was telling the truth and didn’t want me to see her again. So I bounced around a couple of different therapists, but was always too nervous to talk about anything with them in fear of being insulted or disbelieved. 


Fast forward to high school, I develop a pretty bad problem with self harm. I was brought to the hospital a few times because of it and it was generally the same deal. Get cleaned up, referred to a psychiatrist a week later, they’d tell me to get more sleep or eat better or something and refer me to a therapist, never see therapist, rinse, repeat. Until I had a particularly bad night where I drank an obscene amount of alcohol, slashed up my wrists and throat really bad, and tried to jump out of a window. My wounds weren’t as serious as they looked so they gave me some first aid supplies and instructed me to wash and bandage my own wounds, then told me I’d have to wait in the family room (small waiting room with just a couch and a table with some tissues, no bed/washroom) until the psychiatrist arrived at 11am (it was maybe 1am). I got really frantic and begged them to just let me go home. They said no and I tried to run out of the hospital, so they locked me in the family room for the night, without water or anything. I just felt so trapped and helpless that I ended up having probably one of the worst mental breakdowns of my life over the next few hours, tearing out my hair and clawing up my face and feeling more suicidal than I had felt before. By the time the psychiatrist arrived I had calmed down a bit though, and I told her that I was just drunk and I didn’t feel suicidal anymore, and that was that. She made a follow up appointment that I didn’t go to and I refused at all costs to be taken to a hospital from that point on. 


But after a few tough years, things eventually did look up for me. I kind of developed my own coping mechanisms and although I definitely still had issues, I got by fine enough. Until one night I decided to have ONE beer with a “friend” of mine that I had been avoiding due to exam season. He drugged me, held me against my will for hours, and repeatedly assaulted me. I ended up having to go to my academic advisor to defer an exam, because 24 hours after being drugged I was still feeling confused and groggy. I told her the truth because I didn’t know what else to do and she honestly handled it very well, setting me up immediately with a counselor. This was definitely my best therapy experience so far, but it just wasn’t a good fit. She would often recommend essential oils, which just aren’t something I find particularly useful to be quite honest. But she was nice enough and meant well so I kept seeing her for awhile even though it didn’t feel like it was going anywhere, i thought maybe once we got to know each other better I’d open up more and she’d be more able to help me. Anyway it got to a point where I was having very intense, debilitating flashbacks to the night and the next session, she came prepared with something she had “typed up” to help me. She decided to read it aloud to me and it was basically saying like “it’s normal to experience these symptoms after trauma” and it went into a list... which turned into bed-wetting, and asking to sleep with your parents... and then she realized that she had accidentally printed an article about childhood PTSD. And I know she meant well, but I just didn’t see the point in going to a therapist for advice I’d be better at googling myself. 


Anyway my symptoms ended up getting better for awhile, but I don’t know if it’s isolation, or the upcoming court case that keeps getting pushed back, or graduation anxiety, or what, but my mental health is NOT good. I’ve slipped back into self harm on a few occasions now and I’ve been having extreme anxiety and suicidal thoughts. It’s getting to the point where I don’t know what to do, and I KNOW I need help, but I don’t know where to get it. I don’t know if I could afford it. And honestly I just don’t know if it’s worth it.",15Jul2020,1

Learn from my experience. 
Got stopped by a crip a couple hours ago at midnight and he kept trynna get me in his car and wouldnt take no for an answer. Blue busted up car, blue bandanna over his chin and he was eying my sony headphones with his hand over his chin as if he was considering doing some shit. I said have a good day and hinted at me living real close, that my friend was behind me and once i got away i immediately called someone to pick me up. Watched to see he didnt follow me and walked hella fast. Stressfull and scary as shit. I know it wasnt natural because he damn near drove across the whole parking lot to almost stop in front of me. Thank you for listening to things like this. I appreciate it. Make sure you dont make my mistake and walk half a block down to albertsons for razors at midnight. Not even that far smh. Im only fucking 17 and i gotta worry for my life and worry about walking to the store. Im lucky, he couldve done whatever because i wasnt strapped with anything. Thank god for witnesses and my ability to keep cool and not panick. Sorry, just had to vent. Life sucks. Maybe he wanted to roll up on me because im white. God knows that people are using these protests as an excuse to hate. I have love for anybody that took the time to read this. Be carefull, especially nowadays. He was dumb. If he wanted to rob, murder, or do some shit, all he had to do was roll up quietly and wait till i got to a dark area and jump out and club me in the back, shoot me, chokehold, or whatever. I understand that hatred and anger at life and the desire to do things like that but i always let my morals control that desire. I used to walk out in the middle of the night armed with a pocket knife hoping someone would attack me and that I would have an excuse to unleash that pent up anger, rage, and hatred. Ive since learned a lil self love and learned to value myself again. That why i got scared. If this were a year ago, i dont even know what i would have done or wanted to do, due to my lack of self care and anger i have towards society. It wouldve probably got me killed. Whoever took the time to read this, i have an immense love for your compassion and desire to listen to others (if that was the intention).

BEFORE approaching the fundamental principles upon which this lesson is founded it will be of benefit to you to keep in mind the fact that it is practical – that it brings you the discoveries of more than twenty-five years of research that it has the approval of the leading scientific men and women of the world who have tested every principle involved.

Skepticism is the deadly enemy of progress and self-development. You might as well lay this book aside and stop right here as to approach this lesson with the feeling that it was written by some long-haired theorist who had never tested the principles upon which the lesson is based.

Surely this is no age for the skeptic because it is an age in which we have seen more of Nature’s laws uncovered and harnessed than had been discovered in all past history of the human race. Within three decades we have witnessed the mastery of the air; we have explored the ocean; we have all but annihilated distances on the earth; we have harnessed the lightning and made it turn the wheels of industry; we have made seven blades of grass grow where but one grew before; we have instantaneous communication between the nations of the world. 

Truly, this is an age of illumination and unfoldment, but we have as yet barely scratched the surface of knowledge. However, when we shall have unlocked the gate that leads to the secret power which is stored up within us it will bring us knowledge that will make all past discoveries pale into oblivion by comparison.

109,"This app(MyLife Mediation by Stop. Breathe. Think) helps me a lot: it is based around grounding yourself and processing your feelings, thoughts, grudges ect., through mindful meditation. 
These sessions are really short, the longest I've found is 15 minutes but they are generally around 2 to 3 minutes long. You chose the narrator too, based on what you want to do.
The sessions can also be simple, like drawing your attention to sensations or actions. One is even having a cup of tea and being aware of how it makes you feel, the taste ect. 
You also get recommendations on how you are feeling, mentally and physically. 
So guys, give this a go.

I have also looked through the terms of use: they don't sell or distribute you data, unlike other apps like Headspace- who track most of you social media accounts - so it's completely anonymous.

117,"To avoid getting into the details, I have to build a thick wall around myself because I have been struggling with multiple mental health issues for pretty much all my life.

But slowly and surely, I have been gathering strategies, techniques and other methods on how to deal with them, even though the amount of effort and time that it took me was way longer than I waited for them to be and I still have a lot stuff to delve into in order to master these strategies.

Over the years, I have been learning how to break that thick wall that I built over the years and slowly creep into the dark unknown and face these demons and even face the real world due to that my experiences has left me with a scared and scarred image of the world.

But for some reason, dealing with loneliness is perhaps one of the most exhausting, nerve-wrecking and humiliating war that I had to fight through.

I am well aware that loneliness is not easy to deal with - it is a mentally tricky thing to face and counter and can lead to so many other traps and other complications and difficulties that you sometimes become stuck in a maze or a in a super-thick and sticky web of different threads with different poisons slowly sucking away what is left of your blood, soul and health.

It is a double-edged sword that you want to get out of this invisible prison but at the same time, the prison is also your only ""home"" and walking out of it is very scary and the fear of being rejected, even if you try to be as friendly as possible, is very tough to overcome.

&amp;#x200B;

The person few years, I had to really pull myself from my bootstraps to overcome the traps of loneliness - the fear of being rejected, the neediness of attention and the appropriate social skills for different situations.

Yet for some reason, as much as the world of today *should* be able to allow me to use the resources that we use today like social media to my advantage to reach out but in reality, it is often the opposite!!

&amp;#x200B;

I know that social media is a big joke and a trap of itself where behind every smile and photo of the last party, dinner or get away that you want to hides a dark thing that you do not want to share to the rest of the world.

Yet at the same time, seeing the sheer amount of photos and posts where I see smiles and even laughs with other people, friends or even random strangers, it makes me feel angry and pathetic with myself, desperate to do something about it.

I reached out plenty of times with other people but more often than not, communication in the 21st Century makes us more alien than connecting to one another.

It is super easy to ghost someone nowadays or leave a seen without even giving a clear reason why or giving the cold shoulder because the person you are talking to is simply a stranger or you do not like for no reason whatsoever. I constantly feel that I do not know where I am with another person. It is humiliating and nerve-wracking and it burns me out. It makes me feel pitiful, petty, little. It makes me feel less of a human being and like I am being passively-aggressively bullied.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet it is also pretty hilarious that the technology of today is supposed to make us more connected yet it makes it too easy to push people away. 

Why is it common to leave only seen almost after every message? Why not just speak from the heart? Or just say a word? Anything

I feel humiliated and angry and constantly going through a thick and mighty storm every day to keep myself sane throughout this process and it feels like I am going around in circles or walking inside a maze where I have no idea where I am going.

I know that loneliness is also in my head (even though my mind and body have real reactions to the feeling) but this feeling is incredibly overwhelming and when I try to reach out, nobody is available or I have to be very careful of what to say to others as though I am walking on eggshells because of random excuses like being busy or unavailable and/or whatever excuse they can think of to avoid contact",15Jul2020,6

130,"The Road is long and paved with many hazard signs and bright red flags to direct your way, to make you aware of the jagged edges where the footpath ends, to keep you from getting lost. It's a Road that contains many distractions as well, for it is a well used thoroughfare and the feet upon it are many. 

Cracked and broken in places, smooth and treacherous in others; its a difficult road to walk upon, so much so that many choose not to walk at all. At the Road's entrance, piles upon piles of what appear to be rags lay everywhere. Torn and dirty, almost colourless with age... until they begin to move, or groan. They sit huddled together staring down the road, with a mixture of fear and wanting in their eyes. These barely human souls, sitting with their demons to keep them company, are forever lost - frozen in their indecision to move forward.

It is, of course, their choice to see the journey ahead as one containing nothing but fear and pain. It's certainly a valid observation to make from a surface level, but once the terrible/beautiful knowledge that is Recovery is fully known, it cannot be unknown. It is this knowledge, and fear of the Road itself that scares these lost souls more than anything else ever has, paralysing them there in place at the entrance to the Road and all that awaits those who reach Recovery.

There's a tide of traffic to walk against, quite thick at the start and a few dodgy corners along the way. It can almost seem to bottleneck at times. This tide is also barely human, but it's still a great deal more alive than the rag piles at the start. A horde of walking dead, going back the way they came, zombies with very little interest in brains. They walk with conviction mostly, no matter how broken their bodies may appear to be. Briskly, matter of fact-like, eyes fixed firmly on the horizon where their old demons await to greet them as long lost friends. There are a few amongst the tide who walk hesitantly, looking over their shoulders. They are wondering if they should turn around and walk back towards the goal, feet shuffling as they argue with themselves. They try to shake the fear from their hearts at the thought of returning, and wonder if the host of new demons that had come to dance with the old were really as awful as they seemed.

No one stops on the Road. 
They run, walk, stagger in every which direction, some even drifting past the hazard signs and red flags at the edges... but they don't stop. The edges of the Road are even more treacherous than the road itself. The soft shoulder is deceptively spacious and wide, dotted haphazardly with the warning signs and red flags. Some choose to weave through these obstacles instead of walking the road itself. The way is easier at first glance. Far less foot traffic, soft earth to walk upon, just some ducking and weaving. These people walk with a variety of speeds and in all directions also... but those who duck and weave past the signs move fastest of all. They dodge words like ""DANGER"" and ""NO HUMANS BEYOND THIS POINT"". Flags flap in their faces as they impatiently push past, the red fabric unnoticed as they move on. Hurry, hurry, Recovery is just ahead, or was it back there? It all depends on the direction they're choosing to take. Only two are recommended.

You may have gathered this already, but the Road is a rough place to be. A place for the damned perhaps, or those who refuse to see life in all of its beautiful yet terrible glory. It is a place for the ghosts of Pain and Addiction, a place where they wail and scream for the attention of the walkers, showing each soul whatever horrible vision they believe will lead them off the road for good. Whether its back to the start, or straight off the edge, it makes no difference. The ghosts wait, and watch, and seize travelers at every given opportunity. 
Casting them back with the images of old fears and new insecurities, calling seductively, and at times fighting for the attention of the tide openly. 
They don't want them to reach Recovery, you see, and neither will some of their audience when they do.  

What could possibly make Recovery both so horrible and wonderful all at once, you may wonder? Lets talk about the end of the Road, and perhaps it may become more clear. As the crowd thins and the ground less difficult to walk upon, scores of new demons begin to appear in the distance. Some stride forward with ease, greeting travelers warmly, shaking hands and taking individuals aside, speaking with confidence as they lead them away. Still others shuffle and wail, and shriek of the dangers ahead. 

Some of the demons have names that all can recognise easily - Depression and Anxiety are quite the show stoppers - still others call themselves Past and Present. A host of other demons await, many just vaguely recognisable with blurred nametags that only some travelers recognise. They greet the travelers' existing demons as old friends, and call words of welcome to the ghosts of Addiction and Pain on the sidelines. Such is the welcoming party that awaits our weary travelers. Many will choose to simply turn around at this point, fear and recognition now showing in their dull eyes, their pace quickening as their demons whoop and celebrate. 

Still others take in what appears to be the final stretch of their journey, and try to dive off the side of the road entirely. The signs and flags catch some but not all. Young or old, beautiful or weathered, proud or broken, confused or aware... these people are all different but share one thing in common - the look of puzzled fear on their faces before falling to their doom. You may remember that no one stops on the road, but that only two directions were recommended. The edge of the Road is Death, and it awaits all who choose not to travel. 

The destination isn't much better for some at first. Reality awaits on the other side of the intersection that turns off on the corner of Recovery, and that particular highway is what often drives many back down the Road to the start. The knowledge that the next Road is far more confronting than the first sends many running back at first glance, crashing hard into the arms of the Devil(s) they already know. 

The terrible truth that must be realised for many as they each arrive at what they believe is the end of the Road to Recovery, is to discover that there is a road they must always walk upon, finding the strength within themselves to keep going, taking step after step towards the future. After recovery, they must choose to join the greater tide of people in Reality, regardless.

The Road may be long, the race is certainly hard, but in the end, it really is only with yourself. It may not be an easy journey, but its the only one we have once we've led ourselves astray. Whatever your demons, whatever your ghosts, I pray that you all choose to keep walking. If you keep an eye out, you may even see me strolling beside you one day... but only if you're walking forward.",15Jul2020,1

So im ruminating in different life events, stuff that i did in the past and im stuck in one memory that i never seem to be able to forgive my self for. Im feeling extremly ashamed for this and im ruminating if this makes me and horrible person because i read its a serious crime. So im 22 years old and a couple of years ago i watched alot of porn and i stumbled across some child porn videos and actually watched them because i got curious and i can even remember that i got aroused aswell, one girl seemed to be like 12. I even saved a link ( not the video itself) of one girl in a porn video who im pretty sure was underage, (she showed her breast in her webcam nothing else). I was not addicted to this type of porn and i have never done it since then, and i would NEVER do it again. Will this mistake that i comitted in the past make me an horrible person or criminal? I dont know what to do. Sometimes i even want to kill myself because of this. Im not attracted to childs but sometimes i get POCD wich makes me thinks im a pedophile .

136,"I don’t know where to start with this one. I don’t even know how to type this :( 

Years ago, I had some really terrifying instructive thoughts. They were things that I found abhorrent and things that sickened me and that I would never have done in a million years. Whilst changing my nephews nappy, I would think of paedophiles and the terrible things they’d do to young children. I’d try to stop thinking of it because the thought made me feel sick. The more I pushed the thought out, the more it would come back.

This was years ago. I now have my own children and thankfully these thoughts disappeared years ago. 

The problem is, now when I hear stories of paedophiles being caught, arrested and sent to jail, I somehow feel sick to my stomach with guilt. Like I’m just like these people. I know I’ve never done anything like that, never ever would and find the whole thing completely disgusting but for some reason, I still feel this guilt. I feel fear of being caught!

138,"I was diagnosed at 19, I am now 21 but looking back at my life I've often wondered if I had bipolar disorder all this time only that it was so mild that I never really thought of it? And that it just got severe when I was older and then considered a diagnosis?

Because I've had depressive episodes since I was 11 years old and they came and went through the years.

Mania/hypomania is the tricky part because I remember clearly starting to struggle with that when I was 17 and then it got worse.  
But I have read my entire psych journal and looking back there are things I find out. Like my 7th grade teacher saying I usually kept to myself and didn't talk much but sometimes I would come up to her at random and talk a lot and very fast. And I remember many times when I was 13 I would have these moments or days where I was overwhelmed with confidence, walking down the hall of the school playing these upbeat rock songs thinking I was the shit and thinking I was amazing. Getting into a lot of fights etc. Which was in big contrast to my usually depressed self but I always saw that as that I just ""decided"" to stop caring about the things that made me depressed. I remember staying up all night writing music and writing short stories but I don't remember it as the feeling of mania just as being very pumped.

Also searching bipolar in my search history I find results from when I was 11-13 but I can't say I really knew what it was so I'm never sure why I was considering it.

And you could say maybe I was bipolar then and was just diagnosed late but it came to a halt when I was 14 and I can't say I struggled as much at that age. Same with 15. 

Then I turned 16 and I thought I had borderline personality disorder because I was just unstable (as in mood swings every day and being fragile and anxious in general). Which I was diagnosed with at 18. But when I was 17 I recognize the feeling of not mania but hypomania, that specific itch inside. Especially when I started taking citalopram. 

Then something traumatic happened ig and I got full blown bipolar 6 months after being diagnosed with bpd. But the bpd diagnosis was probably bipolar in the making all along because I recognize a lot of those symptoms with me being depressed.

It just really makes me wonder because I blame myself and I try to look at things I could have done differently to prevent myself from being how I am today but I'm also not sure if this was always meant to happen? Because I've been asked about bipolar disorder by doctors since I was 13 and I always said no but if I were to go into 13 year olds me body now knowing what I do I would say I don't know because I can't tell if shit started with that traumatic event or with my first depressive episode at 11 and if I would have gotten it no matter was because it was already ""developing""?

Sorry this is really long but thank you if anyone actually took the time to read because I just want to know if I'm looking into it too much or if it's actually possible I just always had it but it never got severe until I was older.",15Jul2020,1

I need an outside opinion.

So short past time story: I was given into a foster care when i was 14. My parents never gave me rules or boundaries (i know sounds like the perfect life, bc i was doing everything i wanted, but that was the problem) I was struggeling with really bad depression. I went to therapy for like 6 years.

Now I'm 23. I kinda feel like i have the depression under control. But there is something that really annoys me. I don't think i'm capable of feeling love. There was a major event in the past, i had some bad ptsd, but i thought i solved it. But i really can't get close to people. I have a okay realtionships with my parents now, but i don't love them, its sounds rude to say, but for me they are  acquaintances .

I tried to get into realtionships, but i don't feel anything. When a person gets to close it bugs me. I don't like being touched. So i dumb the person, because its unfair to them.

So my question is, can i fix myself? Can i feel love? And how does love feel like?, bc i seriously dont know.

Based in UK, individual suffering is my mother-in-law, who is not a native English speaker but has been a UK resident for nearly 20-years.

Currently, individual is staying with family, but behaviours and things being said around young children make this very difficult and rather untenable, especially with work responsibilities although all individuals do have holiday time.

156,"**For 21 years I never really knew how to express myself genuinely, to the point that even I myself don't know if I'm being genuine in most situations.** 

I envy a child's freedom to express. The can be angry, sad, overly happy, cry their lungs out, walk out when they don't like being in the room, and tell people whatever silly thing comes to their mind. People tell me that I've always been a happy child. But somewhere along the line, I wasn't allowed to be myself. Maybe it started with my dad noticing that I was too effeminate for a boy. He even sent me away to some relatives to ""man"" up for a summer. And like his worst nightmares, I am indeed gay. It wasn't just him, it was the world - the relatives, the uncles, the uncle - friend of my parents, the schoolteacher who tells who to not cry because that's not what boys do. *As a child, I got that signals from my family and the world. It was loud and clear:* ***Hide yourself.***

And I guess it just built up on top of one another. I had to hide something about being queer, which I definitely didn't understand what it was back then, and **it trained me to have a knee - jerk reaction to just hide from everything in general.** I had to hide my thoughts in even the smallest of things. I had to hide what I liked. What I know and what I didn't know. What I did and what I didn't. And the BEST part of learning how to hide at an early age was learning how to hide *effectively* \- that is, they won't discover what you're hiding if you're telling a completely different thing. If you're feeling sad, you show you're happy. So that they don't know what's bothering you, you have to act excited. Deal with them as quick as you can so that you can hide immediately in your room, where no one can see you. You're an actor without pay. 

While at college, I was finally able to express myself to some extent. But because of the years of hiding I had to do, I was developmentally stunned - it's like you're going through a crash course for something that you should've always been doing all your life, which is having confidence to be able to really express yourself. I made improvements, but I can't say that it was enough. Having to know yourself after years of trying to repress yourself leaves you confused a lot of times. It makes you miserable because you are aware that you didn't have the life that you know could've made you more happier and more productive. 

And since you don't know how to live yourself out to the world, you always second guess yourself. **Is this really what I feel, or is this what I trained myself to feel?** Have I ever really been happy if I'm not even sure if I know what makes me happy. I've been living on autopilot for so long, and now I'm going to crash. Is living a life worth it if you're not sure of yourself, how you feel, and what should you be doing? 

I've been hiding and hiding all my life. And now that I realize how much freedom I lost all my life and how little freedom I have now, I just want to disappear. Even if I have the chance to be really free to express myself, I don't have the capacity to express myself because I have always ran away. I have been in a depressive pit the past months because being stuck with my family this quarantine just made me realize how miserable and fake I have been my whole life.

166,"It’s been 6 years since Jessica’s passing, I’m shaking my head writing this line because I’m having a bit of difficulty wrapping my head around it. It’s like that surreal, dreamlike feeling hasn’t faded but became my norm. I’m sitting back, trying to recall what her laugh sounded like, the twinkle in her eye, the comfort of her embrace and to be honest it’s kind of difficult. Writing that line makes me a bit sad but I guess it’s quite natural for these things to happen, right?  
.  
Even though the gleam of Jessica’s smile may have faded in my memory, I’ve gained something new from her, as if our relationship has evolved into something else… not better or worse, just different. I’ve come to rely on her guidance, her assurance, her direction and her protection. She’s not only the metaphorical guardian angel but the needle of my life compass or maybe a secondary gut instinct. I consider myself to be pretty damn lucky having someone looking down on me and providing all this support.  
.  
Like a man taking a mental inventory of some comfortable yet fascinating room, I evaluate my life and see that I’m fortunate in other ways too. I’ve grown so very much in the last 6 years, and I’m certain the catalyst was her passing - but the encouragement to strive for more, to heal, and find meaning in this life was provided in part by Jess’s unwavering love. There is no doubt in my mind that she proved as supportive after her passing as she was for me while still here. Humbly speaking, I’ve learned quite a few lessons over these past 6 years with her constant support but there is one in particular which I will forever cherish and mind; tell the ones that mean the most to you that you love them.  
.  
So in honor of Jessica Marie Hehn, I’m asking all of you to do exactly this. Tell at least three people in your life that you appreciate and love them. It doesn’t have to be anything dramatic or long winded, something like this usually does the trick for me,  
.  
“hey stupid… I want you to know that I love you very much and appreciate you for who you are… even though you’re stupid and you smell bad.”  
.  
It works for me each and every time, I promise. Thank you for doing this for me and to honor Jess. I know it would make her laugh and smile - and imagining her smile and laugh helps me remember it a bit better.

And before all this I’m basically verbally abused by my uncle and grandmother, both calling me useless and disgusting, telling me I can’t do anything right.

Then the virus stuff has stopped me from seeing any friends or other family, and I’ll most likely be moving school cause of our lack of money, and I currently don’t have a house as my mom and I are fixing a place to live in.

Now my mother has gotten sick 3 times in 2-3 months, and she can barely do anything, she’s just lying down puking and having…accidents…and I’m afraid she has Covid now. There’s so much stuff going on for me and it’s just hurting. I don’t know if I’m okay mentally or not, I had a breakdown a couple weeks ago from everything, and I am just not sure what to do.

174,"A quick recap of my mental health. I’ve dealt with anxiety and depression as long as I can remember. I’m 20 years old and moved out of my narcissistic moms house at 17. I’ve tried multiple antidepressants and am in therapy twice a week for close to a year now. I was diagnosed with PTSD along with clinical depression and GAD. I’m doing a ketamine treatment for all of those problems. I’m on my second treatment a feel a little better, more clear, less of a cloud over my head. The issue is I still have a problem with my thought process. My psychiatrist recommended a 6 week IOP I would need to be on disability for this. All the money I have is money I’ve worked for and saved up, I just had to spend 3,000 on the treatment because insurance won’t cover anything. I work at a place that has less than 50 employees so I could be fired for needing disability. Sometimes I just feel like so many things have been set up against me, I don’t have it in me to continue fighting this stupid flaw. I’ve been having the thought that I’m just destined to feel this way forever. Mental illness is really severe in my family and I’m the only one who has recognized it and tried to get help. I just feel everything is stacked up against me. My boyfriend is the only person in the world who I have right now because the only family I’m on good terms With is moving to Michigan.

I and my SO are both in a tough place mentally and I just don't see any way to change it. 
I have IBS, which for me is most often triggered by stress and anxiety. This  makes things difficult since talking about problems is the only way to find their shape and look for solutions. Heavy stressful topics will offend send me to the washroom and shut off my apatite for a day or so. I have been eating under 1200 calories a day for 2 months now. When my partner is upset I get upset, which makes it hard to be supportive. I get physically sick because he is hurting and I am worried about him. 
Our main issue, which we seem to circle back to frequently, is moving. We are 100% ready to move and can find another place easily, but we can't till we sell. Our place has been for sale since last year, excluding the winter, and it just wont sell. We feel trapped, and he cant do about 80% of the hobbies and activities he wants until we do. I am irritated by the not selling thing, but not as bothered because I at least like our current one a little. Neither of us can controll the housing market so this is a weight we cant effect.
Covid is an inconvenience, but not that much of a worry beyond following guidelines and wearing masks for me. It is a much bigger weight for him as it affects every level of his job.
Both of us are working from home, and while we keep schedules and get dressed for work to keep the mindset it is still being stuck home all the time.
My ongoing illness and inability to eat is dragging him down too. Plus our libidos are not lining up because I am sick. Cue feedback loop.

Both of us have several signs of depression, but getting professional help or a diagnosis in this province was a 4-6 month wait BEFORE covid.
I just don't even know what direction to look for help.
I just want us to stop hurting inside, figuratively and mentally. How do we break the cycle and start looking at the future with hope instead of defeat?",15Jul2020,1
187,"Hello, I’ve never posted on here but after a conversation with my mom I thought it was worth a shot. For background I’m 19f living in America, family history of mental health isn’t good at ALL on either side. 

So getting into it, starting maybe a year ago I started hallucinating auditorily, just little things like someone saying my name but they’re just too far to be sure you really heard it or I would constantly hear what sounded like my parents arguing downstairs even when they were asleep. In my opinion it wasn’t that big of a deal, it didn’t impact my day-to-day life whatsoever so I never really addressed it, but now it’s becoming a bigger problem.

Lately I’ve been having a lot of trouble falling asleep, because about every five-ish minutes my door knob turns or at least I hear my door knob turn, I have no clue if it’s really happening or not, it happens a lot when I’m awake during the day too. It kind of came to a head the other night when I was almost asleep, it sounded like someone almost knocked my door down trying to get in, it scared the crap out of me and I sat straight up in bed and it stopped, nothing had happened in real life, it was all in my head. 

I also have this paralyzing fear of someone or some thing crawling around my floor where I can’t see it (and inevitably crawling up in the bed with me), I SWEAR I hear things shuffling down where I can’t see almost like someone’s crawling around and I know it’s probably just in my head and I’m making things worse by dwelling but I can’t shake it. 

I’m staying up until 3-4 in the morning because I DREAD trying to fall asleep, I have three fans, a white noise machine, and music but it’s coming from inside my head so it doesn’t help at all I don’t know what to do. :(",15Jul2020,1

192,"Even when I was young, my mother had told me that my father is seeing someone else. I had been contemplating since last year that I never felt pain even when I heard it from my mother as a young child. Was I confused that time? No. I have a clear definition of ""affair"" even if I was a kid. Was I supposed to feel that pain that time? I think I should've been crying after knowing that but I didn't. 

Fast forward, I had a nice, fun time with my friends, we were very happy. Suddenly it fell out just because they couldn't agree on this travel plan. I wanted us to get back. I was stuck in the middle with two opposing sides in which I just want them to get along again. Afterwards, I finally have no friends! Great. Honestly, it was my fault for not finding anyone to confide in. My mother by that time had been comparing me to her friend's son for God knows what.

When I find a hobby to distract myself from my internal drama, my mother suddenly appears and she tells me that my hobby won't benefit me financially. Would I earn money from doing that? No. Of course not. I was just doing it to make me happy, not to earn money. But she's a mother, and she knows better in this world. So I stopped. 

I still have so many things to say but I just can't jot them all down here. Sometimes my throat just hurts but I'm not supposed to cry when she is here. I've been called a robot by many other people, guess I am.

I don't know if anyone else would read this but I hope everyone could feel emotions when necessary. Sometimes I just feel disconnected with other people but of course, it is my fault for building my own walls even to my own family. There was even a point I wanted to cry but I couldn't. I guess I could say I was not abused nor violated when I was a kid up until now, I can even say I was given a lavish life and pampered.

I won't be fishing for any reassurance. I can definitely tell you that I am an ungrateful, selfish brat that takes unnecessary things personally and supposed to take painful words not as a challenge but only to down myself and excuse my current state.

Sometimes I have high self-awareness and sometimes, I don't know myself. I want to get back to my old hobbies but I can't do it anymore. I want the old happy me. I want to get back soon as possible before I turn into an adult and regret things because I let my so-called emotions drown me.

I don't wanna dwell but I subtly notice patterns to my present and rely on my past and there and then I suddenly hold back. I'm supposed to talk about anyone about this! I'm having a turmoil and it's my fault. Or is it? Back in my head I know my family has an influence in this part but I can't blame them! I should be liable for my own actions.

I just wrote everything without holding back this time. I don't know. I need help or maybe I don't? Maybe I'm just acting upon my hormones and this soon will fade.

But the title is still a question I want to ask you Redditors, as my answer is just one in a million. What are your thoughts or questions? Please tell me as I am willing to listen and answer, if there are any, thank you for your time, if there aren't any, it's okay, I will forget this again soon and it's much better that I am not a bother of someone else's time.

He's now in the depressive phase and it's looking really bad. He's really depressed, doesn't wanna do anything, doesn't want to go out and he also lives alone and refuses to stay with us. He doesn't work so he has nothing obligatory to do during the day and any normal activity he's too depressed to do.

196,"I've been thinking a lot since I have nothing else to do and this whole Covid-19 isolation is like hell on earth.  The reason I say this is because it has forced me to deal and live with my actual life and the reality of the world.  Suffice it to say the reality sucks.

I made all of my friends late in life (in my 30's) so I am no-ones best friend or most important person in their lives.  I know a lot of people but I would say they are more acquaintances than what would traditionally be called friends.

Having friends when you are 40 and the people you know are even older than you is just weird.  As I said everyone I know has someone who is a higher priority than me.  As a result no one calls me, texts me, emails me, etc.  I've tried to put some effort into it but I just got sick of not hearing back from anyone and people not caring.  

I've had a lot of stuff happen in my life and really I have no idea how to interact with people.  The weird part is I do not even know what to do when I do spend time with people I know.

I just think it would be nice to live in a spontaneous world.  In a world where things are a two way street.  

I don't know.  I am an introvert and in the beginning this whole isolation thing was heaven on earth but I am getting tired of it.  I have nothing to look forward to.  No escape from my life.

197,"A little backstory, I’m 17 and I’ve had mental problems ever since I started smoking weed about 2 years ago. At first I only smoked every once and awhile but it eventually turned into an every day thing. I was smoking every day alone for about a year and especially a lot during the last few months of quarantine. Smoking every day slowly brought on so much stress and anxiety and I was just constantly talking to myself in my head, if you don’t get what I mean by this, you know the constant narrator in your head that that turns on whenever you need to think about something? Well it was constantly turned on for me, basically every minute of the day. This brought on a lot of negative thoughts after a while which I still get (but not as often) to this day. I was brought to some really dark places in my head and I knew I had to change because I just wanted to live normally again with general peace in my mind. So I quit smoking about 1 month ago for the most part and decided only to smoke if I was with my friends which is about 1-2 times a month. I took up meditating which actually really helped with my anxiety and to just generally calm me down when I’m in my own head. Anyways I’m starting to live normally again but my anxiety or whatever it is, is preventing me from being happy. I hung out with 2 friends last night who I’ll call Dave and John and this one girl who I’ll call Lena who was a friend of Dave’s and knew John. Anyway the night started out ok my anxiety was definitely present but I could bare it and maintain normal conversation. We went out for a walk in the park to smoke a couple joints I rolled up which was our original plan. As soon as I took a hit of the joint my anxiety almost immediately went away and I felt confident. Before smoking I was constantly thinking about things like am I being awkward and I would just not willingly want to start a conversation with Lena I would respond in short answers if she said something and I wasn’t really talking much at all. After smoking however I felt great all my problems seemed to just go away and I started to join in on the conversation. I just felt present and normal and I wasn’t worrying about being awkward in fact I was actually being funny and confident. This went on for a while and I was getting to know Lena which was nice but once we got back to Dave’s house everything changed. Suddenly the thinking turned on in my head and it felt like my head was telling me “your having too good of a time, let me ruin that for you”. Slowly I became more and more like I was being before I smoked. It was insane.. I couldn’t even make eye contact with Lena or hold a conversation because I was so anxious... this continued until she eventually left and it was just me Dave and John left alone. We watched a couple movies and my anxiety calmed down a little bit but I was still on edge. 

Anyways I really want to know what’s wrong with me and how I can fix this because it’s ruining my confidence and I’m afraid it’s ruining my  years of experiencing what it’s like to be a teenager. If anyone can offer and advice I would appreciate it... thanks


Tl;dr: I have extreme anxiety and I went to hang out with a couple friends and a girl I’ve never met, my anxiety was bad and I felt I was being awkward when I was with them but then we smoked weed and my anxiety went away and I was confident.. after a while of this the thinking voice in my head basically said “your having too good of a time, let me ruin that for you” and I had major anxiety kick in which ruined my night and I went back to being like I was before I smoked.

Yet I can't seem to find happiness or motivation anywhere. I have really bad depression and have let myself fall into a pretty deep hole. It's hard to even care for myself these days. I also have pretty bad anxiety, which makes me dwell, assume, have irrational fears, and be paranoid among other things such as essentially living a life of agoraphobia. I feel like every day is a constant struggle and source of stress. I feel like a failure because I haven't been able to do anything with my life. And constantly feel like I'm not good enough for anything or anyone. I was drinking and vaping as an unhealthy ""coping skill"". But I recently quit both. I've felt nearly consumed lately by my depression and anxiety. I have crying spells multiple times a day. I can't even focus on things, because my anxiety pulls my focus away to dwell on random shit every 5 or 10 minutes. My emotions are so sensitive, like anything can set me off into a spiral. I know that after having been using drinking to forget, I'll have a flood of dealing with everything I've been avoiding. But I've always been like this.. it's just too much to handle a lot of times. There's one person who I can really count on, and who understands my struggles, cares about me, motivates me, and tends to put a smile on my face. But things have been tricky lately. I am somewhat having to go back to dealing with all of this alone. Aside from that person, and a few other ok friends, close family. I really have nearly no one in my life. And definitely no one that fully understands. I also struggle most likely from some level of asd. I tend to have a really hard time reading people, and taking hints. Everything has to be blunt, or else I get lost in assumptions and guesses. I have a really hard time with conversations and meeting new people. Never knowing what to talk about or what to say.. I overwhelm a lot of people because I focus on the nitty gritty details of everything. I also tend to never really fit in and am kinda different.. Between all of the things I've said, I'm just having such a hard time. Not just now. For the past 15 years when it comes to anxiety and depression and for nearly 30 years with the asd. I really don't know what to do. I have suicidal thoughts pretty frequently. And I honestly just don't have the energy to care. The social stuff drains me really bad. And a lot of times I don't feel like i can be myself around people. Eventually, I tend to end up isolating. Which just makes the depression and anxiety worse. I'm just so tired of caring... I'm so tired of trying... I'm so tired of thinking... I'm so tired of hurting... A lot of times it's hard to find reasons not to quit. There's only a couple left that I have. And sometimes the nagging thoughts try to climb over that wall.. More often than I'd like to admit... All I wanna do is sleep. I don't even wanna be awake. I just wanna hide from all of it because I just don't have the energy to handle it most days anymore. I tend to wonder what life is like without depression. Waking up, and looking forward to your day? It's hard to accept that this is my life. This is my fate. How do I even begin to find a reason to live? I want to be happy one day.. I want to try at life.. but why? What's the point... I feel empty inside. I can't even find the energy or motivation to pursue the things I enjoy. most days I end up just sitting there, not knowing what to do because nothing sounds appealing. I have hardly even been eating lately, I'm just not even hungry. I really don't know what to do. I'm on medication. But it doesn't help a ton. I've tried nearly all medications, and none of them solved much. Not to mention that they tend to just stop working after a while. I'm in therapy. once a week. It helps, sometimes. It also makes things worse, sometimes. And I've been in therapy since I was like 3. I'm honestly on the fence about commiting myself. I just don't think that's the answer, and I've had bad experiences with that in the past. I'd probably have to turn to long term inpatient, residential. I'm really scared of the future.. I'm afraid of facing all of this alone, for the rest of my life. I'm afraid of the day where those couple reasons I have left, may not be there anymore. I'm afraid that one day, I just won't have the energy. I'm afraid that one day, I'll not care just enough. Idk.. I really dont know....",15Jul2020,1

I don't really feel anything when I do, not happy, not sad. I just feel sort of empty both in thoughts and emotionally. Even when I say to myself I'm going to do something, I find myself doing this instead at times, even when the activity is fun. For example, yesterday I planned on watching a Netflix show and I was prepared: I completed my work, I did the dishes, etc. Everything was ready- I didn't have to do anything else for the day but simply enjoy what I wanted. Except I couldn't. Instead of watching the show, I just sat in front of my television and stared at nothing.

I have done some research on different types of health food that’ll be able to lift your spirits up, whenever your feel down. Not only will they lift your spirits, but they are healthy! This will drastically help you both physically and mentally. So, without any further to do.... here are some healthy foods that helps to lift your spirits:

Starting off with a tasty one... **Dark Chocolate**. 

Before I start... YUM! Chocolate, dark or white, is rich in many mood boosting compounds. The sugar that’s inside of the chocolate is able to improve and lift your mood since it’s quick source of fuel for the brain. Dark chocolate is high in health-promoting flavonoids, this has been known to increase the blood flow to your brain. Because of this, it reduces inflammation and boosts the health of the brain. To finalise, dark chocolate, inside has a high rating of hedonic, this means that it’s pleasurable taste, texture and smell can promote good mood. That’s your dessert sorted for tonight!

Secondly... a fruit.... **Bananas!**

Banana’s is able to turn that frown on your face.... upside down. Bananas, many like them, many don’t. But, they are very high in vitamin B6. This helps synthesise feel-good neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin. Also, a single banana provides 16 grams of sugar and 3.5 grams of fibre. Wow! 

When sugar and fibre combine together, the sugar is slowly released into the bloodstream, this allows for stable sugar levels and a better control of your mood. 

Thirdly... here’s a boring one... **Oats**. 

BUT, Oats are whole grain. Oats are able to keep you in good spirits and a terrific mood all morning. Another positive thing about Oats.... you are able to enjoy them in different ways and forms, such as... oatmeal, muesli, overnight oats and granola. 

Oats are an excellent source of fibre. They provide 8 grams in a single raw cup. Fact! Fibre, in general can help slow your digestion of carbs. Instead of eating biscuits and crisps, grab yourself a cup of oats. Also, fibre allows for a gradual release of sugar into the bloodstream, this helps the energy levels to stay stable. 

Another one.... **Berries**.

Yup, you guessed it, another fruit. Delicious! Eating fruits and vegetable is linked to lower rates of depression. Berries carried a BIG range of antioxidants and phenolic compounds, this plays a key role in combatting oxidative stress. 

If you’re not able to find yourself fresh berries, try frozen ones. By getting yourself frozen ones, the berries are at the peak ripeness, which helps to retain the maximum amount of antioxidants. 

Lastly... to finish this off... many love it and many hate it - **COFFEE!** 

Whether you love it or hate it, coffee is the most well known drink in the whole world. Thankfully, coffee makes the world a much happier place, believe it or not! Coffee contains caffeine. The caffeine itself prevents a naturally occurring compound called adenosine from attaching to brain receptors that is able to promote tiredness, therefore it increases attention and alertness. 

Also, coffee increases the release of mood-boosting neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and norepinephrine. 

So.... there you go! Here are just a few example of foods (and a drink) that is able to help boost improve your mood. Instead of snacking to junk food over the week, try some of these! If you do, let me know what you think in the PM’s. I’d love to find out what you think. 

As always, my PRIVATE MESSAGES are open for all. If you fancy a chat or some sort of support, let me know and I’ll be more than happy to help. Have a great night everyone!",15Jul2020,1
210,"**Tl;dr: Co-morbid anxiety and depression under control with SNRIs, episode-free for about 6ish years. Met someone special, not sure how to reassure her about myself and potential future. Looking for people's previous experiences sharing with partner.**

Hi everyone,

This post is a little different from a typical post, so please bear with me here. I was first diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Major Depressive Disorder around 2009. I spent the night at a hospital a couple of times due to panic attacks, and eventually through CBT, medication (low SNRI dose), and my own work, my last panic attack was in 2013 and I haven't had any paralyzing depressive episodes since 2012.

Now, after many years, saving the subreddit all the history because it's not relevant, I've met someone I feel like I connect with in every way. The only concern she has right now boils down to her need to protect and do something about the people she cares about. To be more specific, she has no prior experience with any friends/family, let alone significant others, with mental health issues. 

I've tried to explain to her that:  
1. The dose I'm on is very low  
2. I haven't had any episodes in quite a long time

However, the issues she's concerned about are largely:  
1. How will this potentially affect our family in the future (the old nature versus nurture argument)  
2. As a slight control freak and worrywort, whether she can bear with the thought of not being able to do much/anything if I (or our future children) have these issues

Now, for a little more context, both of us were partially educated in the US, but she grew up in a fairly conservative part of Asia, meaning understanding and open dialogue about these issues is sort of taboo, which kind of led to these discussions we've been having. I'm here because we've been only dating a short time, and she's asked for some time to clear her head, do some research, and consider whether we should be together or not. 

*(insert long impassioned speech by me about how I'm super sure about this person, might be ""the one"", yadda yadda no one cares about this, but rest assured I'm here on Reddit because I really want this to work)*

Basically, I've been on Google pointing out research articles and stuff about nature versus nurture, but I'm looking for people who have come out to their significant others about their mental health issues, and how they came up with a bilateral system of support within that relationship. 

Bonus points if your partner:  
1. Did not have prior knowledge or experience with mental health issues before you  
2. Grew up in Asia

Bonus, bonus points if you are the significant other that learned/received all this information

Thanks very much for your time and for reading.",15Jul2020,1

And now I feel pure. I'm going to church tomorrow to embrace god into my heart and ask for forgiveness for my sins.

I've been down and I haven't cared to be alive. In fact I've done a lot of things in hopes of dying including trying to drink myself to death every day. All my meds have made me depressed, they have not protected me from myself. This is a new start and I will let god in and hope he forgives me and that he can allow me to feel the love that I feel today.

I have woken up from a dream, a medicated dream and I feel alive. I will get a grip and take charge of my own life I'm looking into getting a loan so I can buy an apartment and I will be free. I won't make myself depressed with medication and I won't be manipulated into being okay with it. It would have gotten me killed.",15Jul2020,1

Im a girl and i turned 24yo in May, way before my birthday i was freaking out but lately its been so bad i cant even sleep. I feel useless and pointless and i just dont know what to do with myself. I grew up listening to my dad say that a womans worth will vanish with age, and that we peak in our 20s blah blah (yes he is a bit of a twat). So i have always been terrified of growing old. I feel like 30 is the end. Like there is no point in living past that because i Will be a washed up trash bag. And i know deep down its not right, but i cant help but believe it. I feel old.. I look in the mirror and hate what i look like now, so all i can think is ""shit it just gets even worse from now on"". 

I lost my job because of covid and being home certainly doesnt help. Ive looked for jobs but right now its really hard. I see my friends very rarely, most of them are busy with boyfriends, jobs or kids. I feel like they all have it figured out and it really stresses me out. Whenever i do see them they brag about whatever it is they do and i have nothing to add. I do nothing, im just nothing. I try so hard to get out of this funk, i tried hobbies and sports and just taking walks but i find it all pointless. Whats the point? If im miserable outside im better off being miserable at home. Ive forced myself to do all these things and i just cant. 

Im not good at anything, i also dont really enjoy anything so ive come to terms with the fact that im never going to achieve anything extraordinary, im never gonna be ""that girl who is really talented at doing...."". I will never have an actual career and enjoy work, i am and will always just be the girl who serves tables. I missed my chance to be someone, i never did anything with myself because ive always been to miserable to just live. To just enjoy the little things.. Why cant i just enjoy looking at the stars? And taking walks at night? Why do i ruin everything for myself. 

And its not that im looking to have Kids and marry and all of that, im fine being alone, i just want a purpose, something to make me want to wake up in the morning and not just lay there wishing i was dead. Ive considered therapy because lately its been scary. But im broke, i have no way of paying for sessions. The only way to get free is if im under 21yo lmao.

I only talk to like 4 people regularly and even then I don't really talk. I can't remember how to have a conversation I'm just kind of there. Nothing interests me and I can only pass in social situations when I'm drunk and that's terrible unhealthy. Any ambitions or goals I have I quickly give up on and I don't have anyone I can actually talk to about this. I can never form the words when I try and if I try again I feel like I'm just rambling on and all I ever talk about is how fucked I am.

My sibling and I are close and I don’t want him to end up where I am, mental health wise. I don’t know if that’s good or not but I really want to him to be in great health always.

It’s like a never ending cycle. I don’t want to term it as abuse because I kinda know why they are the way they are and they’ve never had a self sufficient childhood like my sibling and I are blessed with, but yk...things hurt. Sorry, I’m rambling. Well, any advice?",15Jul2020,1
223,"So I have a dear childhood friend -25 years old-, whose parents are divorced.

Last couple of  years we noticed he's depressed -his group of close friends- , we tried to help him. his parents made it hard for us as neither of them cooperating.

They both worsened it. And they both are responsible for his misery. They continued their war even after their divorce to include him.

He was in a different country, I noticed he's depressed from his voice, but since it's a very personal matter I didn't bring it up, and he didn't seek my advice, and I didn't want to pressure him. he only asked for financial aid, I supported him every time he asked, after that he disappeared.

I heard from my friends who are in the same region as him that he's blocked them all and is avoiding them. we know he's clear from drugs, alcohol or weed, he doesn't even smoke, but they noticed his very negative attitude.

Last year he came back to the country, I didn't know that, out of the blue he called me at 4am in the morning to ask for a number of an old friend, in an angry tone as if he's holding a grudge against that friend, so I told him: ""Tell me why you want his number? what's the problem? and where have you been all this time? and is this how you speak to a friend whom you haven't heard his voice for more than a year? what's wrong?"" he responded ""give me his number or I will come to your house and crash your car"", I realized he's NOT depressed, he is something else, then I to played along to stale him: ""OK... alright... I don't have his number but give me a few hours to find it for ya"". After two hours he called again and told me to forget everything.

Then I texted his father to tell him the situation, at the time I trusted that his father cares for him, so acted as if he's broken for him and he doesn't know what to do with him, and he's trying to put him in Mental Institute but can't do anything about it since he's living with his mom, so he asked us -his friends- to set a trap for his son so that the mental  institute can capture him outside of his house -because apparently he is living  with his mom and his father cannot (by law) be near her house- so anyway I REFUSED and I told him *""no way I would trap a friend of mine, I will  talk sense to him I'm gonna try to help him...there is no shame in mental illness""* of which his father responded will if it works it works, but if not, send me your location to capture him.

So we took him outside to his favorite burger joint, he was in miserable shape. he had fun with us. then we headed back to our car. 

&amp;#x200B;

As good friends  I told him ""look I don't like what are  you doing to yourself, and we're here for you, and we will always be, we are brothers,  and no matter where you go, we will go with you, and stick with you.. so please listen to us."" before I even continue my sentence he told me to shut my mouth, ""Shut your mouth, shut it, shut it I don't want you to continue, fuck you, fuck you"" then as I was driving in the highway he attacked me while driving, punching kicking, almost causing an accident to kill us all, my other friend held him tightly. he started spitting and screaming. ""Stop the car I will teach you all, stop the car I will fuck you all you sons of bitches""

Then I told him ""why? why did you attack me? what did I do to you? so your father was right? it was true what your father said about you and I didn't even want to believe him"" he was SHOCKED. he panicked and started apologizing. then told me ""stop the car and let me go, I will not chase you.""

but I couldn't do that, I couldn't let him go back to his mother's house and become even worse, so I called his father and told him what happened, his father told us ""Great the ambulance is on the way"", it was not his first time in the mental institute, he was there before, which is why he disappeared, so until they came, he threatened to kill me and my family, he swore on it. I at the time thought this was the best for him.

since that incident I stayed out of the picture. I visited him once in the mental institute and he hugged me.

The mental institute were heavy with him on the meds, they diagnosed him with schizophrenia, he stayed there for three months, then he back out, his father rented an apartment for him, and started causing more problems, not taking his pills. sometimes he takes them, then skips them for months, his mother traveled out of the country, and his father doesn't want to deal with the mess directly.

He asked one of our friends for a gun, and our friend told him why? he said to kill me.

now should I take this seriously or what? 

and I honestly don't know what to do? should I be worried? and should I respond to his calls? he sometimes calls me, sometimes texts me, and I've been ignoring him, last couple of days he's been calling from different numbers and mt friends told me he is in bad shape and not taking his pills again, he even told them he is AFRAID from me....

225,"Hey guys and girls


I'm M24 and live in Germany 
I lost my job back in May because of Corona. 
I get unemployment payments so that's only a little issue because I'm still living with my grandma (She is the only person in my family who's still alive or I have contact with)
My grandparents raised me.
Never knew my father and never had a father figure in my life ..(my grandpa kind of acted like one but he couldn't replace that..)
My grandpa lived until two days after Christmas in 2016 where I found him dead. That is still a great great trauma for me ...I will never forget this picture in my head...


My car broke down and while my grandma paid for the repairs (1.500€), the car is still broken. I cost her so much money ...i can't repay her in my life 
I wish she had a better retirement instead of the need in raising me and investing every Euro in the failure that I am 
I feel so bad because of this she deserves better than me...
If something might happen to her now I will off myself 
I can't support myself 


I have depression and it gets worse by the day 
It's brewing inside me since my grandpa died 
Even the anti depressants doesn't seem to work anymore 
I feel like I'm a failure and useless 
Never had a girlfriend I'm lonely as fuck
It's a pain to wake up and get out of bed, I ask myself every day ""Why? For what? It doesn't get any better anyway..""


There are many more reasons I feel like shit


While the lifes of my friends go forward my life is going backwards ..i would do so many things different if I could go back in time and start over


I lost every bit of hope and will to live..

227,"[TW: obvious mention of suicide, ftm]

I cant do it anymore. I'm a transgender male, unaccepted by my parents and family, regularly accused of deceiving people by my parents.
My dysphoria has gotten so bad that I can hardly leave my room. My family blames me for this.
My mother constantly tells me ""oh, I just wish it was easier for you"" while at the same time barely giving a shit about how she makes me feel. She'll get pissed off at me because her calling me ""beautiful"" makes me extremely uncomfortable. She will say she's on my side one moment and then the next she's saying how much she misses her daughter and how she wishes I would just stop.

I've been out for about 5 years now.
My plan is that once I turn 18, move to an apartment i can pay for and start transition. But I'll be all alone. My parents will cringe everytime they see me or hear my voice. My family will disown me because of their tight religion. I'll never have a girlfriend because I'm short and awkward. And guys will never see me as one of them.
I just want to end it. I'm so tired and done.

Today I went to the doctor for some xrays and she wouldnt stop calling me ""sweetheart"" or ""baby girl"". I was forced to sign a paper stating that I am not pregnant, which was near heartbreaking for me because I wish I never had to touch such a paper. I feel so disgusted with myself. Today I was feel alright, pretty confident... but now it's all ruined.

My mother tells me that I should let that ruin my whole day, but if you dont have dysphoria then you'd have no idea how scummy that made me feel.

I just want to die. I'm tired a living a life where people think I'm deceiving them. I'm tired of living a life where I have to be continually reminded that I am not right in my body. I just want to fucking die.
I cant do it anymore. I dont want to be the ""trans friend"". I dont want a girl to date me because she thinks I'm ""man lite"". It all makes me sick to me stomach.
I wish someone understood but I'm so alone. I dont know what to do now. I feel so lost.

Surgery is a fortune and I come from a poor family. I feel like there is no escape. If I keep living how my parents want, it'll kill me. If my family turn their backs on me because I'm transgender, it'll kill me. 

There's no one I can talk to about my struggles. Struggles of someday wanting to be a husband and dad. Wanting to go to college and be one of the guys. Wanting to be able to have a normal sex life. I cant talk to it with anyone because they just say ""well if you stay a girl you wont have any problem"". My mom cant understand why I want to be a parent, more specifically a dad, and dont want to give birth, but want my child to have my DNA. I wish I was just born male. Fuck.

230,"So I've (21F) spent the last 4 months in my home country in quarantine with my family and boyfriend. I'm going to university in another country, 1000kms away from my home.
Quarantine has felt like limbo. I have no friends in my home country, and it has felt as if I was robbed of half a year of precious uni-life - something I've idealized my whole life. Although I love my boyfriend and family, we've had conflicts through the last 4 months. By the end I felt like they were driving me crazy. I felt like I wasn't really living and I didn't belong there. I had to do something.
So I've went and came back. Got a new place in my uni-town. And only when I arrived did I realized how stupid that was.
It's my exam phase-so my friends and I have to study pretty much all day. I've never been so alone and homesick in my life. It's been a week but there are still times I can physically feel the homesickness, like a burning sensation in my face. I was already struggling with depression when I was back home but it's gotten worse (of course). I have no appetite or energy and even simple things like taking a shower or trying to stuff some food in myself are challenging, let alone studying all day.
I mean I don't know what I expected. I feel so unbelievably stupid. I feel if I had sat down and realistically thought about what it would be like to be here, I could have easily figured it out. But I went ahead and made a rash decision.
I also find myself pathetic. I'm just a priviliged little girl that thought ""oh I'm so sad I wanna go back to that place cause that will SOLVE IT"" and my parents go ""of course darling, we'll pay your rent"" so I get money shoved in my face and once I get here I go ""oh no no i want to go back i didn't want this after all"".

I'm in a pretty new relationship with a sweet, amazing girl. I truly feel very blessed, but I can't help but have trust issues even though she's never given me a single reason to doubt her. When she goes a while without texting me back, I get very, very anxious. I freak out in my head and play every possible worst-case scenario there could be (even at times I know she's busy). Sometimes she'll use Snapchat and such without replying to mine, and I'm positive the only reason behind that is that she wants to be able to give me a proper response but I can't help but have this crippling anxiety.

I've always had anxiety, and have PTSD from some things I endured as a child, so I'm terrified of abandonment and betrayal. She's given me no reason to doubt her at all, literally not one reason, and I know I *can* trust her, but for some reason I can't convince my brain to. Any tips on dealing with this?

243,"I’ve been trying to search for jobs but is been very difficult. I have SAD known as (social anxiety disorder) and it’s been keeping me from getting a job, i try to apply for jobs with the least amount of social interaction like popular restaurants and shops but those are the ones that are popular in my area. I don’t know what to do and i’m freaking out because I want to make some money. If anyone has any advice of what I should do please let me know in the comments.:)",15Jul2020,1
244,"So i was on a messaging site since i was 11 years old, and did some very embarassing stuff. i've met a lot of awful people, and some even threatened to doxx me (they were 20-30 year olds) and one of them proclaimed that they have found my parents. I left the site for 3 years, and now i was back with my new account, only revealing myself to some of my internet friends. Over these past 3 years i developed a trauma, i have nightmares where everyone looks at me in the street and laughs at me, that those people who threatened me actually found me in real life, that i became a lolcow. I spent these 2 years in anxiety and a mental trauma. So anyway, i was contacting with those old friends, who didn't know my identity. everything was fine, i was keeping it cool and mature, I recovered from that trauma, but then i told my real friend about it and how vulnerable i am to such things, and instead of supporting me, he gives my internet friends hints of my real identity. don't know if they believe it or not, i even have thoughts that they know everything about me.  The problem is, my friend triggered my trauma and anxiety again. Now i can't sleep and i have intrusive thoughts about everything, sometimes i even wonder, if there is a picture of me somewhere, being mocked, harrased, laughed at. or are my internet friends actually my enemies, who are just playing the role of a friend while laughing at me behind my back, what if they actually know my identity?... I want these thoughts to stop, they are eating me from the inside, i can't sleep properly at night, I want these nightmares to stop. Ever since these thoughts started i don't recall having a good dream. I wish my friend could understand me, what am i going through, when he started giving hints, i wasn't that worried about it, but now he was sending them pictures of our mutual friends, and i am very worried that this could help them identify me.",15Jul2020,1

my mental health is okay lately... i recently got a job and am going back to school after two years of being in debt. it's been such a wild ride lately...

It was so hard to tell her but now I feel a bit better knowing that that weight (at least) is off my shoulders.

247,"How to get over a former roommate and friend that heavily disrespected and bullied me towards the last few days I lived with him? I bought this fucker meals and gave him rides to and from work when he was low on savings and in need of help. Then he repays me the last few days I lived there with horsing around with me, calling me stupid and generally getting up in my personal space and acting all smug all to just throw his weight around and stroke his own ego. I was already ina bad place because I had moved there for a stressful job and I was getting ready to quit around the time I left. I didnt really react either, because I'm just not very confrontational and because of the fear of police being called or legal trouble.
Still, the feelings of belittlement, being a doormat and just being mogged or shat on still persist a year after it happened and I moved back home. It's just seething anger that comes and goes now. How to deal?
'hurr durr the more you let it bother you the more he wins'
This kind of mentality just leaves me feeling weak and vulnerable for someone else to treat me the same way. I need to know I'm not alone in having experienced this.",15Jul2020,1

249,"Hi All,
Brand new to this sub so please take it easy on me!
I’m 22M and have been diagnosed manic depressive and GAD since I was 14, and have struggled for a long time. I’ve been on basically every SSRI, SNRI and trycyclic antidepressant that you could name, been to 30+ psychologists and never had any success. Last year I spiralled into benzo addiction, ended up in hospital after seizures from withdrawals several times, but have finally kicked them. 
I found a new psychiatrist and have started on moclobemide - I’m about day 24 and this seriously seems like a miracle drug. I still have pretty hard down times, but when I feel good I feel on top of the world. I haven’t experienced happiness like I have in the last few weeks in literally years. Life feels like its worth living again. Anyway, just wanted to share! Love to you all. Together we can do anything!",15Jul2020,1

251,"I can't do anything without my sister and even sometimes my father calling me crazy. I have depression, anxiety, ptsd, bdd, and disordered eating habits(I've never been diagnosed with an actual eating disorder), so I guess I just don't act normal enough. Whenever I try to explain myself they literally just walk away. My sister always blocks my number when I try to talk to her, and she keeps saying things she know triggers me, denies she said anything and then calls me crazy or says I have issues or something. She NEVER acts like this to her friends with any sort of mental health issues, so I don't understand why she does with me. She's seen me getting into an ambulance when I tried to kill myself and she saw the blood on the floor, but she still says I'm making it up. My dad literally walks out of the house, slamming everything he can on his way out, and just leaves me. I try to explain myself and he either talks over me and says I'm selfish and ungrateful or ignores me and walks away. My mother is the only person that doesn't immediately make me feel like she thinks I'm crazy and she actually makes an attempt to understand what I'm saying, but she just tells me that ""things will get better eventually"" and things like that. I don't think my father and sister mean to make me feel so bad, but they never listen to me when I tell them it does and they keep doing it, so that's what really pisses me off.",15Jul2020,1
252,"So one of my friends has PTSD and mental regression. He copes by mentally regressing to a toddler. I'm one of the few people he has told, and he asked me to help by babysitting (basically someone to look after him and make sure he doesn't hurt himself). But the problem is, thinking about doing that makes me stressed, he wears nappies and said I might have to change them! I do not feel comfortable with that but don't know how to tell him because he trusted me with the information and seems to really need me,and I struggle saying no to people anyway. He also told another mutual friend, who said 'no' several times until he kinda pressured her into doing it. He also told her that 1% of the time it is a fetish/sexual thing, and I'm his ex and do not need that right now. I don't know what to do because I don't want to crush him, but I am going through my own things right now (possibly depression). What do I tell him? How do I tell him? Also, am I being totally stupid or naive about any of this, or insensitive? I honestly have no idea and it's stressing me out!",15Jul2020,1
253,I [17m] have this overwhelming feeling of wanting to get something innocent and just torture it and hurt it for no good reason. I want to scream at it and tell it how much I hate it. I don’t know why I feel like this it makes me feel horrendous because I could never hurt someone I loved or something like a kitten or baby animal. But for some reason I have this horrible feeling of wanting to just unload and torture something small and innocent like a toddler or a baby cartoon character. I’ve gotten a rubber duck and stamped on it and ripped it apart but I still feel this feeling. Please don’t think I’m trying to be edgy or I’m doing this for attention this is a genuine concern and I’m trying my best.,15Jul2020,1

256,I’ve been struggling with depression for quite a while and I finally went to see my school psychiatrist and she thinks I’m faking it,15Jul2020,1
257,"i don’t even know if this is the right flair, but there is something really fucked up about me. in november 2018 i started to really think that my school friends were talking to me only to talk to other people about me, like to monitor me. i was convinced for so long, until literally this moment i’m thinking maybe they actually were just talking to me. i swear i heard them talking and whispering about me, and i’d see them walking together talking about me. they’d be sitting on the beach whispering, and i walked back to school to get away from the stress of thinking about it, but they were in their rooms, studying as if they never left. i don’t know if what’s been happening to me for the past 2 years was real or not.",15Jul2020,1
258,"A little background about me: I struggled with severe Social Anxiety for the majority of my life. I was always the shy and introverted guy, even up until my 30s.

A long story short, I missed out on many career opportunities because of my inability to speak in front of people. Whenever I tried to, I would stutter and my mink would go blank, leaving those around me extremely uncomfortable and to deeply shaming myself as a result. This eventually lead to having panic attacks whenever I found myself in situations in which I may be put on the spot to speak.

And I also missed out on having deep meaningful relationships because I did not have the ability to be present let alone listen carefully to what other people were sharing with me. It prevented me from being vulnerable with my wife who I absolutely adore and in my opinion, it is the worst human condition to have simply because it’s prevents connection with others.

Seeing years of my life and my goals, hopes, and dreams pass me by, sent me on an 8-year search for answers starting with CT brain scans and doctors. Who all told me I was fine, and put me on medication (which did not help).

I tried everything. Talk-therapy, Self-love/Affirmations, CBT, Exposure therapy, Hypnosis, and many more tools which didn’t get to the root of the issue. But eventually through much trial and error I was able to heal. It wasn't easy, and it took a lot of action on my part, but at the end of the day I am fully free and it was a matter of finding the right information.

No more physical symptoms and regaining the ability to connect with people whether in groups or one-on-one. A life fueled by freedom and accomplishing my goals. Now, I coach people step by step to overcome social anxiety because through coaching people are able to shift their mindsets while also having someone to hold them personally accountable (the two keys to personal mastery).

So ask me anything 😊

What questions do you have for me?

DISCLAIMER: When I mean ""overcome"" social anxiety, what I mean is that I no longer have intense physical symptoms. There is a fine line between nervousness and utter panic/terror. So now it doesn’t matter what the situation is, speaking to a stranger or speaking in front of hundreds of people, I just feel a bit of healthy nervousness (it’s what makes us human right?). No more out of body experiences and losing complete control.",15Jul2020,1
259,"So, yesterday, I had an odd feeling. I can't describe it as anything else other than negative thoughts being injected into my brain and fears of doing harm. I know I'm not the type of person to want to hurt people, but it still scares me. I'm not sure if it was some form of panic attack, since I'm prone to getting those, especially shortly before/after my period, and I've been getting extremely stressed lately (mostly due to a lack of interactions with friends, difficulties with my parents, possible childhood trauma, etc.). My question is how can I keep this from affecting me in the future and if I should try to get a proper diagnosis after this pandemic is under control?",15Jul2020,1
260,"First post here, but I’ve been sitting with some of these thoughts for a while and I had to rant a bit while I’m feeling brave.

For a little context - I’m an artist and a part time streamer. My work CONSTANTLY relies on a very simple rule : “ you must be the first to do it, and you must do it well to be successful “ which is easier said than done. I have constant struggles with depression and anxiety but this year has been a pretty progressive year for my mental health. (Last year posting anything like this would have sent me into panic) I’ve really pushed forward to heal. 

Recently I’ve noticed, while I work on my self confidence, I’m having a bad time with personal insecurity. Feeling as if i’ve never created anything good enough or unique enough and that I’ll never make it to the goals I’m aiming for (self employment, full time streaming, successful freelancing etc.) While I grow my community connections I realize this comes out as jealousy very easily and it is NOT my intention to look spiteful and cranky at other’s success. 

The old saying that goes “there’s always someone who will do it better” makes these feelings worse. People say it to make you feel better but it just alienates my negative feelings. It feels like even if I do something that I’m so proud of, something I think is new, what’s the point if someone does it better? It’s irrelevant that I’ve made it. As a creator this can be pretty detrimental to my work. 

I know admitting it’s a problem is a good way to start but I wonder if I’ll ever see the end of these insecure feelings and if I can one day view things without being afraid it’ll harm my chances at success.

Anyway... I guess I thought I had more to say but that’s pretty much it... feels good to finally type it out so to those who read through, thanks!",15Jul2020,1
261,"I have many friends who are all going through something mentally, big or small and I try to help them through it as best as I can manage. People seem to trust me fairly easily, and I’m glad of it. But I feel like it’s putting a pressure on me to be OK, because when you’re feeling down or sad, you don’t want to talk to another down/sad person to help. You want someone outside of your current emotions. I’m scared to tell them I really don’t like the why I look and I’m currently dieting at a fairly young age and it’s been really stressing me out. I especially don’t want to mention it around a friend whom I love more than I can express who struggles with an ED. How can I help my friends while also taking care of my mental health?",15Jul2020,1
