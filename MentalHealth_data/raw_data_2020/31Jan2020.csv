2,I was sitting with my friends at school when the topics came up of who was most likely to die young then one of my friends turned to me and said that that would be me and that I should do it already. For the rest of the day I kinda just became quite and distant and had a empty feeling,31Jan2020,4
3,"So this is probably going to be a very long story..
A bit of a vague background 
I am currently married with my best friend at 23, good job life is great... but I am very depressed .. low libido, PTSD, self esteem, borderline personality disorder.. and i feel like this is part of the reasons why..
Ive never actually spoken about this, fully... and i really want to get it out of my chest.. and what a better place to here.. 
I honestly don't even know where to begin..


Okay well here it goes... the first person who did it..no one knows.. i was 5 years old.. and it was my sister. 



I was born in mexico, I have 6 sisters and only one brother.
(I am number 6 Female) 


My sisters and I have always been close, since we were little. Our home in mexico had 3 bedrooms 2 baths. All the girls would sleep in one room (had 2 beds that we shared) my parents and my bother had their own room. Anywho, I used to shower with my mom or sisters since as far as i can remember till like i was 7 when we moved to USA.

Well.. in the bathroom is where it started..

My sister before me (lets name her Sam) spent most of my time together since she is only 5 years older than me.. 


There were various times when me and Sam used to shower together and things were well unpleasant.
There was another time when my parents were having a party. And there were tons of kids and adults.
Somehow she got us to play adult. 
There were so many other instances but i cant post them because they are utterly disgusting..

Just.. why her? 
Did something happen to her?
I want to ask her..
But we have a good normal relationship rn and i feel like asking her would open up old wounds for me.. that im not ready to open...

Just like the second person I'm going to speak about..

My bother in law..


my parents were very bad parents most of my teen years when my last sister was born they didn't pay much attention to me. Yelled at me..mistreated me, called me the meanest names when i made mistakes.. i could count the times on my hand my mother would huged me from the age 10-18.. they played favorites with the youngest one. And ignored me.. but always expected too highly of me..

Anywho.. my sister.. the one before Sam..(lets name her Gina) 
Married to my brother in law when she was 17 ( he is 10 years older than her.)
I was 11 at the time..

Time passed and they had a baby, i still struggling at home so i liked being away from it and became their personal baby sitter. Since i took care of my younger sister and they all worked, i ended up going over their house and baby sit..
Sometimes only my brother inlaw would be there, sometimes me alone with the two kids.

The first time, ill never forget..
You see, i have freckles..
He was playing a game, and i being a 12 year old wanting to be cool and included since i always felt alone, wanted to play. 
He said he would let me.. but if i lost, each time he would have to kiss one of my freckles.
I found this sweet and innocent so i let him.
Mind you, to my eyes I only have a splach across my face, my cheeks and nose, also a mid size one on on my cheek. Things didnt go so well and normal.. i cant explain what happened but following after

The next couple of days i knew... I understood it was wrong.
I didnt want to visit. 
I didnt want to tell anyone or talk to anyone.
I didnt think anyone would believe me.
Or say it was my fault.
Cause everything waz always my fault..

My brother inlaw i guess felt guilty and told my sister because a week later she came to the house and came into my room, she looked sad, and asked why i havent gone over or why i dont want to go back.
I didnt say anything besides, idk, i like home better..
She sat down in my bed and started crying, telling me she was sorry and how he was sorry, that he told her what happened. I didnt ask any questions or said anything. Just began to cry.
Moments passed and she said it would never happen again. To forgive him...

Everything was somewhat normal for a couple months.

I started going back to her house and got comfortable enough to start sleeping there again..
You see, im a mid to heavy sleeper.
So, sometimes i wont wake up even if there was a siren right by my ear..

My brother inlaw would do stuff to me in my sleep.
I am a heavy sleeper but i woke up to some at times..


I never told anyone besides a few very close friends..not even my husband knows.. because he is the father of my 2 beautiful nieces and 1 nephew. And my family are all okay with him.

He still makes weird i love yous, ive tried to keep it normal for the sake of the family and relationships but i hate him.
I love my sister Gina but i hate her too.
Was she blind to this.
Does she even know everything that happened the first time?

I hurt so much because at the same time that this was happening 

My 3rd molester was my parents roomate.

Yes, we hand a roomate. It was weird but normal, he was like a family friend but only to us.
He was also in his 30s.
Whenever i was left alone at home he would be there and he would corner me and try to kiss me, succeeded a couple of times. Told me one day wether i liked it or not i was going to be his wife.
And other uncomfortable things..

Why didnt i speak? Was it really my fault..
I became so numb to it all, that i didnt fight it anymore.
I wanted to die.
I still do, i hate myself, i hate my freckles.
I tired killing myself twice.
one when i was 15 and another at 16, 
My parents never cared to much for me back then. They were too busy on work or my little sister that when they saw my cuts in my arms they called me stupid and that if they saw more cuts they would beat me.

Mind you, this is was years ago.
And it still hants me.

I met my now husband at 15 and we started dating and he loves me and i do him.
He helped me get through a lot. But he doesnt know about anyone else besides the last guy.
Because he has a friendship with my brother in law and sister.

My sister, i forgive her. She was a kid too you know. I dont blame her, things could have been happening to her too. And from what she once told the family, my brother sexually assaulted her too. 
But nothing ever was mentioned after.
I want to ask her and talk to her..

Anyways.. this is far too long, 
I recently started feeling suicidal again and i wont tell my husband why.. 
There is so much more messed up in my life..
But i guess that will be a confession for another time..

It was tough writing this.. and it sickens me how much these people massed my life. My will to live. And My sex life...

Idk how to work through this.
I am going to therapy and my therapist wants me to tell my family.
But im scared.
My sister is onces again pregnant and im here trying not to kill myself because of all the mental problems i have that my dear husband deals with.. yet doesnt know why..",31Jan2020,1
4,"The last thing I want to do is minimize her issues with me. But, that's what I'm going to do here.

We argue, but it's over small stuff and it's usually me getting annoyed with her. She doesn't like it when I'm moody, but I'm always quick to try to turn things around and get back on track. I've been in two other serious relationships, and this type of arguing feels not ideal, but I'd still say it's natural and OK. We don't shout or do or say mean things. It's more just an attitude problem. Overall, I'd consider our fights pretty healthy.

She thinks it's the biggest deal in the world. She thinks the occasional argument or conversation that leaves a bad taste is the worst possible thing that could happen in a relationship. I understand how arguing could be tiring, but to me, her analysis feels way out of line with reality.

I think there's more going on to the situation, and here's why...

She has a big time career in the public eye with a lot of stress. Last time she was in a stressful career place, about 8 months ago, we broke up.

The first breakup happened because she said she would call me one day at a specific time, I got a bit irked when I waited around and she didn't keep her word, and I brought it up calmly the next time we talked. A few days later, I get an email that basically says that conversation was abusive (big red flag for me) and I'm super mean and she can't be in the relationship anymore.

So, 3 months pass when we don't talk. She isolated herself the entire time and drank heavily. She told me she was vomiting almost every night for nearly 3 weeks. Her whole family knew her mental health was poor. She eventually came out of it, contacted me, told me that I did nothing wrong and that she was sorry and that she had a breakdown from stress and lost control. She insisted this was how she felt and I forgave her. It took a lot for me to trust her again but she promised it would never happen again. My mom is bipolar and I've gotten used to being understanding of these types of things, despite it being horrible.

Cut to now, and it's the same thing happening. There is another very similar major milestone in her career. We start having small little fights or arguments that she takes from a 1/10 or a 2/10 on the intensity scale directly to a 10/10 every time, no matter what it is or how I react.

Half her words are telling me she loves me more than anything and I'm her best friend and her family. The other half of her words are her saying that the relationship cannot work and I need to leave. We've been talking about the break up, with me basically begging to work on it, for about 3 days now before it finally stuck. I wrote her a letter apologizing and trying to take responsibility for my role in her feeling poorly. I told her I would work hard on interacting better and giving her what she needs. I tried so hard to be a leader or at least a good person here, despite the dynamic feeling completely unfair and out-of-whack with reality.

She had a trip to Los Angeles planned for work today to have some major meetings. She cancelled the entire trip and I think she's planning on starting drinking heavily again.

I've brought up my concerns a couple times about the similarity between now and the first break up

I'm sitting in a hotel right now wondering what the fuck happened, and I can't help but think that she needs some kind of help. She's been in therapy before and has had run-ins outside of our relationship with some acute mental health episodes with anxiety and that sort of thing.

I don't necessarily expect to get back together. I wonder if she will turn her perspective around like she did after the first break up, but I can't wait 3 months and I don't think I can trust her again. The first time was probably the last chance. But I'd like to at least understand the situation better and to do/say the right things to her if we do speak again. I just want her to be happy and I want to understand why I couldn't do it. I love her so much.",31Jan2020,1

7,"Last year I had gotten engaged and before marriage I discovered she had over 2 dozen affairs. So I broke it off I'm depressed and anxiety ridden. That's taken care of with a prescription. My real question is I feel like I developed a fetish for that. Like being a cuckhold or something which is something I've never had until those events it's been almost a year. I've had other ""relationships"" since then but whenever I do think about it I'm torn morally in my head. Like what is wrong with me. I'm not sure how else I can explain it. I don't like being cheated on but at the same time I think I do. 1 half of my brain says it's okay the other half says how dare you think that. I need some advice....",31Jan2020,1
8,"Today’s session: Control. Why we crave it. Why we exercise it; and, why we feel we have no other choice, no option but to maintain it. 

Is it that control boosts our ego or that circumstances leave us no choice but to take responsibility of a situation simply because no one else will do so. A choice is a choice is a choice but consequences of not taking control can create suffering for loved ones. Ugh

Yep, that pretty much sums up my session. 

Oh, and what it means to learn about myself, accept myself and like myself. Obviously I didn’t understand this and am still a bit unclear about what it all means. 

Today was to be my first session since November 2019 to not cry. Well, there’s always next time.

9,"last year, my mental health was at its worst. i was cutting, not taking my meds, and absolutely miserable. i didnt shower. i didnt brush my teeth or hair. i was disgusting... along with this, i was feeling terrible about the fact i was born a woman. and i was only fifteen when this was all happening. 
one day, my friend had caught me cutting in the restrooms. she told the counselor, which i do not blame her for, but it almost... ruined my life a little more?
my dad was already mega abusive. he’d push me down stairs, deny me medical attention, insult and degrade me, hit me.... but when he learned i selfharmed. he lost it. in front of students in the office, in front of the counselors, he screamed that im going to live with my mom and he was done with my bullshit.. he said and i quote that if i wanted to die i would do so at my moms house. he drove me immediately there afterwards without anything. took my phone too. i had to move schools, basically change my whole life...

now he “misses me”. fucking misses me. he abused and kicked me out and never got me the help i needed. told me i cut for attention, that depression is bogus. now he misses me. wants me to come back. my mom says hes super depressed now, guess thats a little ironic, but. anyways i dont want to come back. i kinda... feel justified. but at the same time, i feel like a total ass?? idk. im torn. if i go back, i can stay in this state (my moms moving to florida in six months) idk why im even fucking considering it im just!!!! feeling bad :)

10,"Hi, I’m fairly new to Reddit, so I hope I’m doing this right. Yesterday, I thought I was finally going to end my life. I finished my suicide note, printed it out, and walked off campus, intending to jump in front of traffic. However, I didn’t. All I could think about was the possible guilt the driver might experience for the rest of their life.

I have an appointment with a new therapist tomorrow as a last ditch attempt at recovery before actually taking my life. What should I tell the therapist? Despite going to therapy since middle school, I’ve never actually talked about my suicidal ideation or self harm. Should I show the therapist my note or tell them about how close I was to finally committing? I don’t know how to broach the topic. Thank you in advance.",31Jan2020,1
11,"A while ago, there was a conversation on ask reddit about some people mentioning horrible videos on the internet. I remember a comment named a website where you are shown a series of videos that progressively get worse. I looked it up today out of curiosity having remembered that thread from a while back. 

It was a big mistake. I forced myself to watch all the videos. The last 2 videos however were the worst ones. I still wish I didn’t watch them. It’s been half a day and I still can’t get those images out of my head. I didn’t eat... I can’t eat. The way the meat jiggles... the way it’s soft. I hope that this is a temporary matter. I haven’t cried in about a year, I can’t cry. Even if I wanted to, I can’t. I tried to draw or listen to music but it’s only a temporary distraction. I don’t feel like the same person. How can I overcome this?",31Jan2020,1
12,"There are some people in the world who think that counseling and medication will make their partner, child, or friend “better” again. While it makes improvement, there has to be support. People who are coping with their mental illnesses need support and need the people close to them to support and make an effort to help them cope. A parent can’t simply give their child pills and a therapist and say “I tried.” The parent themselves didn’t, they took the easiest way for themselves. A better option would be to acknowledge the illnesses and possibly change what they say or do to the child. (Still not free from punishments like a regular child.) Groups of friends who find out that their friend is depressed will very often make little to no attempt to try and help. 

What I’m trying to say (and failing to) is that we need to actually support each other.",31Jan2020,2

14,"Hello,  


I have a problem that is probably familiar with almost everyone, but I and my family are struggling with what to do concerning the mental health of a family member. I am not in direct and constant contact with the person in question, however, my close family is and I feel the need to reach out because I am very concerned at this point and rather lost.  


I have a relative that has been ""off"" for a while now. A few years back, they separated from their long-term partner with whom they practically grew up with and spent a long, but tumultuous, committed relationship together. Tensions grew deep between them and after living apart for a while they parted but remained in contact. I believe that the conflict between them is the origin of my relative's mental health struggles.   


Lately, my relative has been experiencing paranoid and delusional thoughts, mostly about the family, the ex, and will make odd and nonsensical statements and accusations. They have even threatened family members. They have self-isolated and I think they drink and unhealthy amount of alcohol, most likely to self-medicate, but this obviously just exacerbates the problem. Each day I think that their mental state worsens.   


Only once was there an attempt on their part to accept that they needed help. Unfortunately, this visit to the walk-in mental health clinic was ineffective. Nothing came of it besides frustration as they were told they needed to ""see their friends more"". No referral. Disappointed with the outcome, I think that they resigned to be non-committal and unreasonably suspicious of receiving help from mental health professionals -- or any doctors for that matter. It is unknown whether they answered openly/honestly about the reality of their mental state, and so it calls into question really how to receive an accurate and useful ""diagnosis"" if they are not willing to accept help.  


I am so worried about it all and I am seeking any solid and informed suggestions with how to go about giving the advice to my family that they so desperately need to be able to know what to do next, what the next step is, and how to go about it-- how to access the help the family member in question needs.  


Most of all, I just feel like I need to be there for my family members who are directly affected. I want to be able to give them an idea of what steps to take and to lead them in the best direction so that they can deal with it all and get things back to ""reality"". Ideally, I want my relative to be able to function to their true potential and hopefully regain a sense of control and some peace of mind.  


In my opinion, I think it starts with anti-psychotics to control the paranoid delusions and therapy weekly to talk it all out. As well as complete cessation of drinking/smoking marijuana/contact with ex.  


Any questions you have, please ask and I will do my best to answer.  Thanks for any advice.",31Jan2020,1

17,"Hi! I’ve been having this issue for a few years now and couldn’t find anything about it online.

Every now and then I get a sudden bad feeling. Honestly ‘bad’ isn’t enough to describe it. It’s a horrifying, dreadful, terrible feeling. The worst I can even imagine.

I don’t think i can explain how awful it really is, but I’ll try. 

Out of nowhere I just feel like all the happiness and positivity is gone. I just want to leave the place, doesn’t matter if I’m at home or outside, I just want to leave immidiately. 

When I was searching for something that could explain it online, all I found was people having a bad feeling in terms of thinking something bad was going to happen to them, but it’s not like that for me.
I never think I’m in danger or anything like that. 

It happens very quickly. One second I’m completely fine and the next it’s awful. I feel extremely distressed, maybe a bit lost as i just kind of disconnect from reality and everything that’s around me. The worst feeling passes in a couple of minutes, but it makes be feel bad for the rest of the day.

It can happen anytime and anywhere. I can get it three times in a week and then nothing for a month or longer.

I just really want to know what is it and why it’s happening.

I do have bad depression and anxiety, but even at the worst times it’s nothing compared to these sudden feelings.",31Jan2020,1

19,"using a throwaway because dont want this on my other account. I feel as if I don't really matter anymore ngl. I try and try to keep on going but i have constant negativity being put on me and I just cant handle the weight of it as much. I thought about talking to a therapist but at the same time I'm very apprehensive about talking to one. Every day its either my family bringing me down by saying something about me that they think doesn't hurt me from the way I act, but it does hurt. I had to disassociate with the only friends I had for 5 years because I never felt welcomed or fit in with them, no matter how much I tried I would just end up being put down and treated like I wasn't a friend (had several occasions where they questioned why they were still friends with me). I've been cutting which I never even expected myself to do ever, and my thoughts have just been negative for the longest. I keep a good look outside to keep others from worrying about me, but then inside I just... idk what to say about it. I rarely talk about it because I'm going to be a full grown man in 2 years or so, and I've been told many times by family to ""stop being a little bitch"" when getting sad or mad at what they say to me, that or I have an ""attitude"" towards them that then turns into me being the main cause for the problem and then I always end up being the bad guy. There are some good times yeah, but theres a lot of bad times. I always blame myself for it though, because I've only shown myself as being the least serious goofy type guy that has no problems whatsoever. Honestly theres a chance my baby sister will grow up with one older brother if my thoughts keep on going the way they are.",31Jan2020,1
20,"So basically me and everyone who knows me can agree I laugh at some stupid stuff for way to long. I’ve literally laughed at the sound of wind. Like actual laughter, not a giggle.

22,"I have very bad OCD for a very long time but I don't believe I've been officially diagnosed with anything else, though therapists have thrown around a lot of different ideas.

I find myself mirroring strong personalities I come across, particularly people I spend a lot of time around and media I just finished engaging with. I'll adopt body language, speech patterns, self-image, writing styles, philosophies, and modes of thinking. I'd like to think this is something everyone experiences, but it has me a bit worried.

Every roommate or friend I've ever had (not that many tbh) I've mimicked. I've mimicked their depressions, their decision making processes, their goals, and so on though never to any overt degree. And of course I've mimicked family members, who hasn't? But I'm worried part of me has been permanently damaged. I worry my self-image is forever attached to whoever I spend the most time around. I wonder if I've always wished to be left alone so I don't have to go through the process of mirroring, or if there's any way to move in a healthy direction.

Are these symptoms of something, or is there a way to spin this in a positive light? Creating a separate positive mental image that I could mimic somehow? How on earth would I go about doing that?",31Jan2020,1

24,"This is something that I've recently noticed that kind of disturbs me. Ever since I was a very little kid I have been obsessed with the idea of being something that I'm completely not. When I was little I'd just pretend to be an animal or whatever (like kids do) but as I've gotten older it's gotten weirder.

&amp;#x200B;

In middle school I'd pretend to be fictional characters and do roleplay type stuff. The thing is, it was never just roleplaying in my mind. Like- I knew I wasn't actually that character but it was like my brain was somebody else.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I create full biographies and social media accounts pretending to be people that I'm not. This isn't to catfish or troll anybody, more like I just want to see what it would be like to be somebody else. It's bothering me because I have at least 6 personas that I've created and interacted online with. Sometimes I don't remember doing things (which is the really stressful part here) and a lot of the time it's like I'll switch into another mental state.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if this makes sense. Does anybody know what this could be and how to stop it. I feel guilty, even though I've made sure not to create any sort of relationship with these personas and real people.",31Jan2020,1
25,"I am just lost

I have suffered through having depression my entire life. When I was still in school I was suicidal, but I thank god everyday that I never went through with those toxic thoughts. I met my fiancé right after high school and he has been amazing support through things that have been impossibly hard but things have been getting worse.... and I’m back to my depression. I’m not suicidal this time but its still so hard. I’m not working right now, which might be the problem but I honestly have no idea how I would get out of bed in the morning and go to a job anyway. There is a lot of family stuff going on (parents getting a divorce, finding out my dad is abusive towards my mom, and my only grandfather passing away) and my fiancé and I are completely broke.... I feel useless and disgusting. But the new symptom of my depression this time around is the boredom. Nothing entertains me anymore. I’ve watched a million shows, nothing, I’ve read a bunch of different books, nothing, I’ve cleaned and gone for walks, I’ve listened to music and watched movies with my man..... nothing helps I just lay there staring at the ceiling thinking about all of my anxieties, and everything that is making me so sad.... I just want to something to take my mind off of this feeling for just a minute.",31Jan2020,1
26,"Why am I so sensitive and weird?

It’s just...absurd how sensitive I am. Not the typical, “I’m offended by everything you say” sensitive, but emotionally and mentally sensitive.

I’m going to try and keep this post brief but I’m really struggling right now and veering on going into a bad place, so I might want to overshare. Mentally I’ve just been on a rollercoaster these past couple years and especially during 2019.

I’m 22 year old guy, probably gay, as a kid I was really attached to my mom. I still depend on her for a lot of emotional support. 
 
Nowadays I’m so obsessed with how I look, act, think, talk, it’s driving me literally insane. But at the root of it all I’m so insecure and my self esteem has become non existent. I can’t be around people without thinking I’m the weirdest person in the world, I don’t have any friends to talk to right now, but I don’t think I could even attempt having a relationship with anyone anyway. I’m so sad and pathetic all of the time. 

The worst part is, for someone so self conscious, is that I think the depression is starting to really affect my face/facial expressions. People talk second glances at me all the time, some part of me would like to think it’s because I’m good looking, but I’m really not. 

This whole post sounds pathetic and whiny but I just don’t understand what’s wrong with me. I see a therapist but I don’t feel better afterwards, I open up to people but I don’t feel better. I try and get out and just feel like a freak. The only thing that distracts me is college right now.

Is there something I’m missing? Is this just what 22 feels like? Am I more then just depressed and is it some kind of disorder? Am I just really weird? At this point if I continue feeling this way for much longer I don’t think I’ll have the strength to go on. I was close to suicide March of last year and I don’t ever want to go back to that place, but I fear that I will. 

Any help would be appreciated, thank you",31Jan2020,1

28," 

I believe I have some sort of obsession with perfection. Now we all have our own definitions of it, however mine is the ability to have limitless potential in the things we wish to learn. Everyday I wake up and think about the things I want to learn. Right now for me it is the game League Of Legends, however a few years ago it was Art and before that it was music. I wish to be among the best in a hobby and try my hardest to learn new things about it so I may become the best version of myself I can possibly be. However this is where life takes a turn for me.

I have ambition and drive but these only take me so far. I do learn the very basic things about something, but there is a point where I come to a plateau. Once I hit this plateau, there is no getting over it. I’ve tried looking up the most efficient ways to learn new skills, learn new thoughts, and just learning in general. I know I don’t have any sort of learning disability or anything but it always feels like no matter what angle I tackle this problem at, it never works out. Sometimes I think I find the “answer” to this problem but after a few days or maybe even a week of not seeing any results in what I am doing, I try another method. This cycle keeps going until I eventually start getting incredibly angry and frustrated that I can’t improve at anything I am doing. The only thing I have ever wanted was the ability to improve in the things that I have wanted to improve at. I never really get angry at others, so I would never pose any danger to someone else. The only person I get incredibly angry with is myself. I get mind numbing headaches thinking about the “answer” to this problem, especially at night. I find it very hard to go to sleep sometimes and sometimes leads me into staying up all night. All of this is very hard to explain verbally so that’s why I am writing it down. 

This continuous cycle of wanting to get better at something, finding some method of learning it, and it ending in failure and me switching to another method has been going on for years. I wish I could just feel like I’m getting somewhere at all. My mentality has degraded so much over time that I used to be a fun loving optimist but this cycle has turned me into a very pessimistic type of person, that I just believe that things will inevitably go wrong. I used to have a very caring heart for other people, but now at this point if something furthers me in my goals and at least gives me that feeling of some achievement or growth, I wouldn’t hesitate to ignore my loved ones. I have an obsession with the ability to learn, which I believe stems from the idealistic perfection. I’m so afraid that every time I feel like I see a glimmer of hope and that I have found this “answer”, I have to write it down in a sort of list format and then live by it, but then when I see that it isn’t working, I delete it and move on to another. I realize on the inside that people have flaws and that is okay, but for myself if I feel like I don’t even have the ability to remove my flaws. This leads me to total anger towards myself and my inability to improve. I just wish I could find the solution to improvement, but I never end up finding it and unless I seek medical help I don’t ever think I will. It’s completely maddening. My only wish is to feel improvement and feel like I’m getting closer to my goals, but I never do. I constantly feel stuck.",31Jan2020,1

So I started to stress eat more because I didn't know how to cope. That's when I got introduced to my ED (I didn't know it was an ED at the time), I tried to talk to my parents but they told me I was too young or to stop feeling sorry for myself. This went one for a couple of years until it got really bad last year. It started with me cutting out sugar again but I got really into calorie counting like I was obsessed. My parents started to notice and told me it was because of my phone and they confiscated it for some time but it didn't do anything. Then I found out about thinspo and would constantly look at the skinny girls and their thigh gaps desperately wanting to look like them. So I started to exercise at random times at night like at three AM and every time I ate a big meal I would try to throw it up so I wouldn't get fat.

He was patient with me and I managed to explain to him that I'm unhappy. Not with him, or work, or anyone else, but with myself and my feelings. 

It was absolutely one of the most difficult things I've done for myself. He waited and let me figure out what exactly I needed to say. I couldnt leave anything out because I knew when I came home I would be thinking about the things that I wish I'd said.

Initially I'd just wanted to let him know that I have problems with depression, and that I hoped my mood lately hasnt been taken personally by him and anyone else I work with. I asked him what he knew or understood about depression, so I wouldn't feel like I was just being crazy. I didnt expect to tell him so much but once I started to explain my basic experiences, his willingness to understand and learn why someone can feel this way allowed me to open up more. 

I spent so much time weighing the thought to speak to him. I know if I kept on like this I might do something rash at work, and let my frustrations with myself get the best of me. I've already been struggling so bad this week and there aren't enough places to hide. I also knew if I told him, there would be no more hiding. If there is something wrong, he knows now. And if it turned out he wasn't capable of understanding, I might have alienated him even more. My rational mind knew he wasn't that kind of person though.

I feel the oddest sense of relief and pain. The whole conversation felt like a dream. I suffer from feeling like I take life for granted, but right now I feel so fucking fortunate and lucky to have a friend like him. I am not fixed, and I'm honestly very embarrassed, but I was met with a genuine enough interaction that I didn't feel hate and frustration towards myself. He said I was considerate to come forward with this, and I believe him.

So.. He knows now, and I feel this weird sense of vulnerability, but talking doesn't seem so frightening anymore. It really felt like a step in the right direction. I'm not sure how or when I'll seek professional help, but I have the support of my workplace at least, and I feel like it's a little less impossible now",31Jan2020,1
55,"The fact is no one wants to be around someone who's upset. It's a harsh reality but it's true. No one really cares if you're sad they want to be around someone who makes them feel good. People who make others feel good are people who are always smiling and happy and making jokes. 

I want people to think of me as a happy go lucky girl who has nothing going on in her life and if I know anyone has any other feelings that are different I get super stressed. I hate talking about my emotions and feelings and I hate talking about serious stuff about me. I'm more than happy with helping someone out with their problems but if I feel like someone knows my problems I feel awkward and upset. 

I guess its because if people think I'm happy it forces me to think I'm happy too. It's kind of a fake it until you make it kind of thing. I used to be super good about crying by myself and then minutes later being the happy go lucky girl but now not so much. Now little things set me off where I want to cry in public and it scares and infuriates me. Idk why I'm like this but I hate it. I dont want people to feel bad for me because it makes me feel wierd and strange. I want them to like the energy I have. I want people to gravitate towards my laughter even if it's fake. But maybe I've been faking for too long because when I'm alone pain is the only thing I feel.",31Jan2020,1

But for the last 5 or 6 years i have realised that i want to work a lot but just cannot get started with it even though i like it and like to work. And even if i start to work i can't work more than a few hours and after few hours i feel like i should call it a day and i just then waste rest of the day.

62,"I have no motivation to work at all. It’s been a pretty major issue in my life. It’s not that I don’t understand the importance of money and making a living because I do. I’ve tried to convince myself that this is not a good way to think or feel, that I want to do well and make a lot of money. When I see homeless people on the streets, yes I feel horrible for them, but I tell myself if I don’t work I will end up like that. To no avail, I’m already in that frame of mind again with my new job.

I dropped out in 12th grade. I was very intelligent and only needed 3 credits to graduate. I attribute depression, growing up with an mentally abusive alcoholic father and being harassed and bullied (by administration) as the reasons for dropping out. I was in a very bad place mentally at the time. I’d like to think I’m in a much better place now but my work ethic sucks. 

I’ve been through more jobs than you can count on two hands in the last 5 years. Even more is the time I’ve spent unemployed In those 5 years. It’s been the only constant problem in my relationship of almost 6 years. After all my of failures, my boyfriend has gotten me a job where I work the same exact schedule as him. I get the same days off as him. This was supposed to fix the desire of us both wanting to be able to be with each other as much as possible. It was supposed to increase my desire to work. I’ve been working at the place for about 3 months now. I was pretty happy doing what I was doing but now I’m going to be trained on something I don’t really feel comfortable doing. I don’t think telling my boss will change anything. It’s where he needs me. 

My boyfriend said he’s not stopping me from getting another job, but obviously I have to find one first. But I can guarantee you I won’t find a gig like what I got anywhere else in terms of our schedule being the exact same. 

I don’t want to leave my house. I don’t want to leave my dogs. I don’t want to be away from the people I love. I truly hate money. We only get one short life and we waste it away working like slaves. If I have to work I’d rather it be with my family providing for ourselves. But you can’t even get land anymore for free. EVERYTHING costs money. 

I know I should probably see a mental health specialist, but that’s a step I don’t know if I’m ready to take. 

I think it’s also worth noting I guess I’m in a position where if I lost my job and my boyfriend, I’d be okay for a little while. (not that I want to because I don’t) but that fact makes me feel like worst case scenario I’d be okay. Like if I Really couldn’t find it in me to work and I loose this job. This is what scares me. This whole frame of mind is wrong and toxic. 

I don’t want to ruin my relationship. I don’t want to ruin my life. Any advice or stories of similar feelings would really help out. Anything is appreciated. Thanks.",31Jan2020,1
63,"This is just a vent post, no need to respond.

I'm getting really bored of my life, it's the same day in and out. I feel, passionless, exhausted and like my life isn't going anywhere. I know for a fact it won't, capitalism has decided that the rest of my life will be spent working in some soul crushing job until I die.

I'm also lonely most of the time. The only 'friend' who actively wishes to hang out with me is a corporate bootlicker and a manipulator who has practically stolen money from my family. I miss my friends who I related to, the more artistically inclined bunch. The ones who relate to liking nerdy shit like I do.

Everyday is passionless and lonely. To cope I've tried in vain to seek the path to self-actualisation. A small sketch in my journal here and there to help release the creative sides of me which I usually hide from others. Storyboarding for animations that I don't even know if I'll bother to create. It helps to some degree, but it's no cure.

Attending a local vocational school which specialised in more corporate affairs, I was taught that these passions are meaningless. I was taught that the expression of emotions and of the self were signs of weakness and replaceability. I think maybe it's left a mark on me, spiralled me into something of a depression after already having to battle obsessive compulsive disorder. At least I'm waking up to what's happened to me.

I was told that what I'm going through is a crisis of meaning, a term that explains most of my situation. I'm still left asking myself though, what happened to being human?",31Jan2020,1

65,"Hey guys, I am posting on this sub because I am truly frightened with whats happening to my life right now. It seems I am having a complete psychological breakdown, and I am unable to trust any of my thoughts. I feel like someone who is so far from the norm. I talk to people and analyze their way of thinking, and conclude that I think so differently. Right now I can't even think straight. I can barely understand anything people are telling me, and I feel much of my previous knowledge no longer exists within my brain.

It seems I have been stuck in my head for as long as I remember, and am constantly thinking about how I appear to others. It has gotten so bad that I have almost gotten into fatal motorcycle accidents in the past due to not focusing on the present moment. I can't enjoy any experience at all. All experiences require my 100% attention to myself and how I'm behaving. Why the hell do I think like this? Why am I so different?

I can't even communicate properly when I talk to people. Its like thoughts are racing at a million miles an hour and I try to tell myself ""be present"", but it distracts from my thinking pattern and I'm unable to formulate a sentence that can communicate the thought that I have. 

 I have no idea how to behave in society, possibly due to me isolating myself for the past 4 months due to depression. I have developed extreme social anxiety to the point that I am completely clueless when someone is speaking to me. Its like I can't understand whats the best thing to say next. 

My question is, should I see a psychologist? I've tried to do so in the past but I wasn't able to properly communicate the thoughts that I had with her. Being in situations where I am being listened to or being evaluated gets me so fucked up that I don't know what to say or do anymore.",31Jan2020,1

Saying goodbye was the last straw and I was finally able to cry again for the first time in over a year. That feeling of sadness may be painful but at least I feel something. It tells me this was real. This has been what I always wanted in my life but what always felt unreachable and wrong to aim for. I didn't feel lonely anymore, even if it was just for two weeks.

69,"This is my first time posting in here, I guess I just want to get everything out there.  In August, I moved from Wisconsin to Arizona to start college.  I got a dream spot studying musical theatre in one of my favorite places in the world.  My class is pretty small, 16 freshmen, and we have all gotten really close like a family.  In October, everything started to be too much and I started to feel like I couldn’t do everything I needed to, and if I wasn’t cut out for college I didn’t have a point in living.  It has been nearly impossible to find a therapist and my university doesn’t have enough resources available for all of the students that need them so I couldn’t see one as often as I needed.  I checked myself into a mental hospital for the first time.  I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression when I was 10 and have been on various medications since.  I was under the impression that I’d go to the hospital and get my medicine figured out, speak to a therapist and get set up somewhere long term.  They immediately took me off of the medication I had been taking and put me on lithium and abilify.  The whole experience was honestly more traumatic than helpful and I remember crying myself to sleep and praying that I could get out as soon as possible.  All we did was group therapy and random circles where we talked about our problems.  I thought at least some of the stuff I learned was helpful, about taking my mental health into my own hands, but mostly I just wanted them to see me be healthy so I could leave.  They set me up with a psychiatrist and therapist locally and I was on my way.  The psychiatrist upped my lithium dosage and I began to feel nothing like myself, foggy-headed and forgetful all the time.  I expressed this to her and she didn’t seem to care, so I stopped taking them on my own.  Then at my next appointment she scolded me and put me on 1/3 the dose of the medication I was taking before I was hospitalized. (Logic wasn’t her strong suit I guess).  I continued to struggle, getting to appointments without a car.  I went home for winter break and realized I forgot my medication in my dorm.  We called my psychiatrist a few times to ask for another prescription we could pick up for the month away.  No response.  So I was off medication until January, another detriment to my health.  I decided I was done with that psychiatrist and health agency as they were inconvenient and unhelpful.  What followed was weeks of some of the darkest and lowest things I’ve ever felt.  I was suicidal every single day, crying on the phone to my mom, calling crisis lines, nothing changing.  Eventually I was able to get an appointment on campus with a psychiatrist, hoping to get stabilized before I looked for a more permanent solution.  If you haven’t been through a med change or pharmaceuticals in general, it’s a long, often irritating process.  My mother flew out after an especially awful breakdown where I expressed how I had no choice but to die because things were never going to get better and kept getting worse.  We vowed to take a week to figure everything out and make a plan.  So we went to countless meetings with mental health professionals and university staff.  We decided I would take a reduced credit load, enroll in an intensive outpatient program, and start seeing a therapist close by weekly.  You have to understand that being in a deep depression like this, I have no motivation but am just going through the motions trying to make something work.  After my mom left I started thinking about just how much was on my plate now and how much more responsible I had to be.  I realized there was no way I was going to continue being in school if I was really going to get my mental health back to where it was before.  We talked with the director of my program and he gave me the opportunity to take a medical leave, and rejoin next years freshman class in the spring semester where I left off.  This was one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever made.  I decided it would be the best for me in the long run.  I leave Sunday and each day I just get sadder and sadder about it.  I want to be here in Arizona, doing what I love, but I just can’t and it breaks my heart.  I don’t want to leave all my friends, even though I’ll be back in the fall.  I feel like I’m not a part of anything anymore and that I’m just a failure.  The cold winter back home is gonna kill me, not to mention that my only couple friends there are in school.  I don’t know what I’m gonna do but I just keep praying things will get better no matter how much they look like they won’t.  Here’s to sunnier days ahead.",31Jan2020,1

71,"Before I begin, I would just like to say that this is my first post on reddit, and I absolutely don't know how this works. Please 🐻 with me.

I decided to move to a new city less than 2 years ago. Mainly to take care of my mental health, since I've been struggling with it for years now and this new city seemingly had better infrastructure as far as mental health is concerned. And also to start working regularly again.

Things have not worked out the way I wanted to, unfortunately. I have lost multiple jobs, mainly due to my inability to cope with the pressure that comes with it (I work in advertising), but also because I think I wasn't able to communicate the extent of my problems to people around me. So much so, that I have imbibed this constant fear that I won't be able to bring a level of consistency that I expect from myself, as well as from my present/future workplaces. Because, again, it is something I have experienced in the past.

I have been to therapy, on and off this past year. I intend to start going back to therapy again, although I don't think I'm in a position to understand if this is helping me or not. My friends have kind of alienated me. And this is something that I have faced with multiple people and not just my friends, where I don't think I've been able to get through to them. I get this feeling that even though people say they understand mental health, they seldom really do. I was trying to open up to this particular friend (who has known me for decades) about things not working out in my life at that moment (I had recently lost my job, been in a life-threatening accident, and also gotten out of a relationship), and all that person had to say/highlight were my shortcomings (lack of focus etc) and erratic decision making (I've had a fair share of that too, I won't disagree). Not sure I needed that. Not at that moment. But then I understand how it must look from the outside.

People have this conception of me, where they feel I am lazy, I am not interested and clearly lack the essentials needed to deal with things in my day to day life (especially my workplace). Because how can someone have such a mismanaged life? I must be doing something wrong. The sad thing is, I have started to believe a lot of it. 

So here's where I am currently. I am working in this extremely shoddy company (the reason I decided to join this place was because I felt I could deal with the pressure), but because of my demeanor at my workplace, I feel like I'm being trampled over. Again. And I know this will continue to happen going forward, because as a society I don't think we're quite there yet when it comes to understanding mental health and our role in it. People have busy lifestyles, and to quote someone who said this to me very recently, ""I have a low threshold for bullshit"". Even after working weekends and overtime (I'm the last person to leave my office), they felt let down because I had to suddenly take a week off from work due to a deterioration in my physical and mental health. 

I know, all the things I have mentioned are a bit vague and ambiguous in nature (because I don't think I'm quite there yet in terms of opening up to people in general). I am currently staying alone, trying to work this out on my own so that people around me don't get too affected by whatever is going on with me. I do smoke a tiny bit of pot every day just to take the edge off, whenever I feel a sense of panic or something similar. I'm trying to get back to writing again (for myself, not for work). I have supportive parents, although they don't understand mental health that well (they still extend their support wherever they can). I've started playing video games in my free time. Watching soccer (and hopefully getting back to playing again somewhere in the future) And my short term plan going forward is to take a short holiday, just to take my mind off of things. Get a pet. And start going back to therapy again.

Just wanted to share this to see if there are people going through or have gone through similar situations in life. 

TIA!",31Jan2020,1
73,"My roommate is an alcoholic, and he's mid-late 20s. Last night he started drinking probably a fair amount.

At around 3 am I woke to him yelling nearly as loud as he could yell. ""What the FUUCK! What the fuck! Fuck this!"" and then he would kind of sing and be like ""wooooweeeeee"" and slam doors over and over. It was incredibly aggressive and felt pretty inhuman. He'd pace around to his room, then back to the bathroom, and would repeat. As if there was something in his brain that was broken. I thought the neighbors were going to call the cops on him and that he would get arrested This went on for about 2.5 hours, I think with some pauses. He broke a bottle of vodka in the bathroom during this process.

His sleep schedule is whack because he's unemployed. At 7 am I woke to him having a completely pleasant phone call with a friend where he was offering that friend moral support. He was as calm as a person could possibly be.

I confronted him this morning, shaking. I've lost a lot of sleep to his actions but last night was absolutely insane. When I confronted him, he had no memory of this, and was genuinely confused. I told him what I witnessed and he didn't really have an answer for me. I told him I didn't know what else to say because I don't even really know what I witnessed. Is this PTSD? A dissociative episode? Just being drunk?

I've seen this before. There was a mid 50s homeless alcoholic man who lived near my old apartment. I'd give him money sometimes. He was nice but could barely talk due to such a damaged throat (my roommate has a comically growly voice, so probably on that same path). At night I'd see him sometimes just fucking yelling and cussing at the top of his lungs. Full on crazy homeless mode. For hours. At nothing in particular. All I can say is that what that guy did and what my roommate did seemed to me to be the same thing. It doesn't seem to have come from a coherent place. It's like being stuck in a maximally uncomfortable state while in a trance or something and the person in that state has the impulse to just yell at the top of their lungs.

87,"It’s been buried in my subconscious, but I’ve realised lately that the only reason I avoid sleep and procrastinate at night is because of how dark and fucked up my dreams seem to be. I hate sleeping, and I hate my dreams. They’re always ugly, dark, and I wake up in panic a lot of the time like I have today. 

They include: 

- Being back at school and reliving my experience with being singled out; failing in class, bullied and chastised by other students and my ‘friends’ at the time, a source of ridicule. I wake up in panic every time as school developed a painful and severe anxiety deep inside me. I have been unemployed ever since I left school, and haven’t fully recovered from it. It was the worst experience of my life. 

- Jumping off of high buildings. Like last night, I dreamt off of jumping with the intention of killing myself, and becoming a blob summation of organs, nerves and blood on the pavement. Then everything turns back to black and I usually wake up, or I do it again, usually with a celebrity turning into me. 

- Relating to killing my self. Usually arguments with my family; my Siblings telling me that I’m not good enough, that I’m a burden and hindrance on the family, that I’m a loser, that he hates me. Then getting beat up by them - we argue a lot, so I guess this is why. 

- Other stupid things like turning into an Eldritch monster; being an old man; squeezing a dog toy and spiders crawl out of the orifices (I have a fear of insects; namely spiders). 

- And lately I’ve been harassed by a stalker, and I dreamt about a smothered relationship with her. That’s something I can’t go into, but that’s ultimately terrifying. 

It’s weird, to me these are ‘normal dreams’ but after talking someone I’ve recently been fond of , apparently not. I’m concerned about who I really am. Why are my dreams so ugly? I can’t sleep at night because of this. I’m pissed off at looking at this ugliness.",31Jan2020,1

I am colorblind ,but just get so frustrated and have very low temper requirements. I get so annoyed at my house when my sister does little things like cough and I have to walk outside to calm down but at school I can’t do that and a lot of times I feel like running up to the people who are bullies to me or just annoy me and beating the crap out of them.

90,"I know it probably sounds daft but the documentary had some terrifying cases of this, including a woman who survived it, it was a woman in her 30's and she said she suddenly felt hot in her throat, and then flames started spewing from her mouth. She drank water and the fire was put out, but she sustained 3rd degree burns to her stomach and intestines and had a scar on her abdomen because of the heat of the fire coming from her gut.

The others weren't so lucky and were found reduced to a pile of ashes. For example there was one where a son was talking to his mother upstairs, then he went downstairs for 15 minutes. He then came back up to find his mother was burned to death in her chair, with her legs and arms and head intact but the stomach area was completely burned out and reduced to ashes.

Ever since that I can't stop thinking my gut will suddenly catch fire. The documentary had a British chemist named John Emsley mention that our guts produce a self-combusting liquid called diphosphane but in tiny amounts, too small to cause self-combustion, but in some cases it can produce too much and this ignites all the other flammable stuff in the gut and can blow a hole through the abdomen in some cases as it's more like a fiery explosion.

Another terrifying fatal case was witnessed by relatives and the woman was just reading a newspaper when suddenly blue flames burst from her mouth and gut area before she died. The documentary had a terrifying reconstruction of this, specifically when her relative looked away for a second and suddenly saw flames in the corner of his eye, only to see her spewing flames out of her mouth and abdomen like a dragon, while she was completely motionless/in shock.

Ever since I can't stop thinking about my gut just bursting into flames and burning to death from it. I always have a glass of water next to me in case it happens, and when I go to sleep I have a 2 L bottle of water next to me. I hate being human sometimes our bodies are so badly designed, I've never heard of birds exploding into flames and there's like a hundred times more birds than people.

Whenever I'm talking with friends I get anxious, thinking they might suddenly start having fire bursting out their mouth and gut, then keel over and burn to death from the inside out, and imagining how traumatised I'd be if that happens. This case is one of the most haunting ones for me - https://enacademic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/1034226

Is it possible to remove the gut surgically? Ever since I saw this documentary I want to get rid of it because I feel like I have a bomb inside of me.",31Jan2020,1
91,"I have caught myself red handed in a ""pattern of behavior"" here on Reddit that is ""something I do so often and it's a classic way I think and do things""....

Please could you take a very quick look at this ""pattern of behavior"" of mine and can you give me suggestions as to what areas of mental health this is. or if you recognize this pattern within some type of condition or within yourselves or if you feel it's related to anything..

I'm undergoing a long term (Probably all of life process) of trying to lessen my symptoms (If it's possible as we all know trying as hard as we like doesn't mean we succeed does it) - if you recognize this pattern then any input would be helpful to me in my overall work with my psychiatrist/doctor/therapist and most importantly my own self because as well as being here offering help and support to other people I have gotten so much help from talking and interacting with the community here on these different boards that we all use.

Here is my pattern I want to ask you about please. Firstly I want to just say I have never ever been banned and never had a post removed and never gotten into any kind problem anywhere on the internet for anything - I am not a controversial person and I am tactful - I don't cause problems in real life and nor do I on the internet - I am ......OK now I'm going to use this as another pattern (I talk to much...I waffle I go on and on and on and on)

&amp;#x200B;

1. I talk too much...I go off at tangents.....I just confuse people with my thoughts..I go from one thing to another... I just have done it right now.. Look back at this post.... I have now switched to an entirely new pattern..Pattern of talking too much, pattern of waffling and pattern of going off at tangents.......... 
2. Now I'm going to go back on my original request for patterns. I've already messed up this post. Posts are supposed to be small and succinct.. now nobody is going to read this and my mind is full of doubts  and I now want to delete this post and delete my entire ID&gt;..........

3. Here is the original pattern....I'm asking about

&amp;#x200B;

I have just posted a long post which took me about an hour in all of my time to try to help a girl who is having issues. I will provide the link. I realized after I posted that it was a huge huge post. As with all my posts it's honest and genuine and mindful of not saying anything that could be misinterpretated or whatever.... 

On one of my comments one person took away a point from 2 down to 1 which meant my karma point went from 5 down to 4...that caused me to re look at my post and think someone didn't like it.....then I started to have more doubts.. although this is my truthful and honest opinion and it's totally not even talking to a person who is suicidal it's talking to that persons girlfriend - have I been to harsh - is my opinion going to have some knock on effect...

Then I see that she has not replied to my one post and I've now replied 2 x and not got a reply...so does that mean probably I've done something wrong. Have I offended that person are people going to not like my post am I unhelpful and is this damaging to the community.

Am I going to get banned, will the moderators look at this post and see it has harmful because I've told my own opinion and it might not be poplular but I've tried to be fair and give reasons for my opinion. (Please don't comment on whether you agree or not agree on what I have said because that's not the issue here)

My normal reaction is to delete everything I've written on this post and to permanently delete this account. 

I would go back and delete every other posts I've ever made with this....

I've done this so many times...I always have a new id even though 

Somedays I've gotten 50 karma in 24 hours through posting on one channel like suicide watch..and suicide watch they don't go around throwing karma at you for no reason. My point is that I am not an problem poster I am not a nuisance I genuinely contribute but why why why why do I do this..

I can't bear my words or my voice or anything recorded about me to be put down.....I mean why do I do this... even this post will probably make me delete it.

I even go and learn how to disguise my writing so I can't be traced. I post this..stuff. this is all I post online..there is no other place online I have ever posted why am I so scared...I am not wanted, I am not a criminal, I have no criminal convictions in the world....but I hide all the time..as if I've got something to hide.....

Why do I do it??? Rarely rarely would I do this in fact I've never done this before...it's actually a sign of my overall slight slight slight improvement.

I was going to write to the moderators but I'm too scared becasue they might say something negative about my post..when in the past they've done nothing but made me more effective, and more helpful to anybody in need.

Do you recognizes any of these tendencies at all? What is this linked to? Is it all or nothing thinking? 

I've done it before...even if I get my grammar wrong I sometimes will delete a post.. I am scared to talk normal like ""non formally"" I always seem to want to make my posts sound like i@m a news reader or somnething.... i care about ...OK here's another bullshit thing I do...

&amp;#x200B;

If my post no matter how small doesn't get a reply from someone else and other comments do I feel like what the hell is wrong with mine and I delete it....I feeel rejected and.......not only that 

If I edit it for spelling or something and then I go away and it looks edited I think and worry to myself that someone is going to think ohhh noooo he's edited it that's suspicious so I'll then delete it...but then you know when you there's a time lapse between someone writing a comment, posting the comment and the system processing the comment well if during that itme I've deleted mine then someone else posts in reply to my comment and it leaves a messed up look where it says ""deleted"" and someone has posted to that ""deleted"" comment and it looks untidy and messy and I'm responsible for that so not only do I then delete all my posts on that post but because all my deleted posts are linked and can be seen by admin someone somewhere has always got and always will have the power to see that I am responsible for messing up the look of that post! 

I therefore often will just delete my entire accoutn permanently. I've got over 100 accounts like this I just make them use them...then something like this happens and I delete..the thing is i get good feedback there's no arguments and I'm not deleting them because of some negative thing....I haven't had a single cross word with anybody on Reddit in my entire life..not even an online disagreement. I don't even go into those ""argumentative areas"" and even if I was I would never ever argue in a public space...so it's not like I want to cover up something and start again...........................

Is this something that applies to people as well? What is this thing that I have that makes me do this....

&amp;#x200B;

I am not going to put a TL;DR because I don't know how to summarize this condition which has plagued me so long - it's just one pattern but as I caught myself doing it in real time I thought I'd just put it out there and see if a single person reads and can relate..............I'l,l delete this and this account before days end anyway....

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to anybody even attempting to read this and any feedback would be a bonus. There is no right or wrong here...just any thoughts or opinions are truly valued!!!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I caught myself in a pattern of behaviour that i wanted to share to ask if anyone can relate. I am a serial account deleter for no reason. I suffer paranoia/ocd. Two things I'm addressing here is

1. I go off at tangents when I talk. I talk a hell of a lot. One of the reasons I'm not unhelpful in Suicide Watch..I care about other people ....OH SHIT I'm doing it again..I'm going off tangent on a tangent....flipping heck...
2. I delete stuff and always want to start again. It's a hallmark I do it with relationships, people and places....I love people but I dont' throw them away ever but I think oh they'll not like me because I'm this or that so I'll go and ask another girl out or she didn't like my opinion about this or that so I'll go and find another girlfriend or something like that. Or I'll have a small argument with a friend and think oh that's it broken forever they'll never like me again blah blah ..and so on and so on

Update: Since my karma went down to 4 that provoked me to self doubt and since writing all this it's gone back up by 2 points.... now I'm happy again..but that's not the point. What is wrong...I mean I know that you have to sometimes be prepared to say what you believe and feel even if what you say is not believed by the masses..",31Jan2020,1

I dont want to hurt her I love her deeply but a large part of me just wants to shout at her and tell her all the ways it hurt me. I twitch when I am around her when I think of her doing it which has a crippling affect on our physical affection.

My thinking for why SH is considered problematic is due to risk of escalation (over time to get same effect) and potential risk of accidental suicide.

97,"This month I was especially stressed out about choosing future plans. It also has been a week of being constantly anxious of the corona virus and after two weeks we will be flying to Cyprus with my family which only adds up to all my worries and fears. After last friday my classmate who is one of the few people that are closer to me stop talking to me. I don't know why but it was the time I felt the need of support the most. It made me realise how we aren't that close and don't know much about each other. It sucks as it seems that I'm not good at making friends, maybe it's just because I still haven't found my type people.

I had anxiety problems from my childhood and it's very hard for me to cope with them, also it seems to me that my perspective of live is unhealthy.

All of the things added up.

One psychiatrist told me ""you have ADD, that's why the world is so overwhelming"", the next said ""bi-polar! You need to be on mood stabilizers!"" So much for science.

But I finally found it. The magic pill. The elixir of life. I don't know, can't know if it will work for anyone else, but by God I swear it's working for me.

What fixed it for me, and I mean *fixed* it, now I'm ok, just normal, was Vitamin D. 1000 IU - one pill - every day. The big oil-filled capsule of Vitamin D specifically, not the multivitamin with a tiny amount of everything in it. Cheap. No prescription needed, no special secret MLM formulation, no mysteries of the ancients, no nothing. Just go to local pharmacy, purchase vitamin D. I keep it next to my shaving gear, pop one every morning. When I'm about to run out, I get more.

Hey all! It seems most of you guys here know that the mental health scene and stigma is still very strong and discriminating in our modern society and it goes to show how hard someone with a mental health condition like depression, anxiety, bipolar, personality disorder etc. has to go through just to find help or even just someone to talk to about their feelings.

I've had enough of the discrimination and marginalisation towards people with mental health conditions and hence, what I've been working on the past few months is creating a closed non-profit telegram support group for you guys of all backgrounds to come together to support one another, as well as advice each other when one is going through a tough time.

We are about 300 members strong as of today.

The group is a caring, close-knit, non-judgemental and well managed community filled with people being able to freely express themselves in a safe space and share any sorts of problems or issues that is currently affecting them.

Remember you are never alone in the fight against mental health and if you wish to join this closed telegram group please do so with the link below or search huddlehumans in the telegram app.

100,"I’ve always been someone who was categorized as optimistic. 

Whenever someone would do something questionable to my judgement, I would assume the best of them. Give them the benefit of the doubt. I have always liked believing the best of people, and most of the time this benefits me and helps build my relationships with others. 

I ended up getting burned a few times because of this. There was instances where it led to me ignoring signs of failing romantic relationships, friendships or just general mental health problems. 

Maybe my optimism was a bit childish. Maybe my optimism was blinding. Maybe my optimism needed to be replaced with realism in some circumstances. 

But now I often see myself assuming the worst. When someone doesn’t clean their dishes right away, my mind goes to “wow they’re lazy” instead of what I know I would respond to as “maybe they’re really tired after a long day at work. It doesn’t really matter that they left the dishes there. I know they’ll clean them eventually”. I have good, nice, reasonable roommates. 
I know this isn’t me, and I hate it. 

I’ve been wracking my brain trying to figure out what is at the root cause. Is it because I’m burnt out working on a masters thesis and having a part time job? Is it just me getting used to having roommates (I’ve always had my own apartment)? Is it because I’m home more so I feel more responsible for the chores? Is it because I’m feeling overwhelmed? Or that I just doesn’t know what self care I need?

Or is it because I’ve just lost my faith in people?

I know it would be unreasonable to ask anyone but myself to answer those questions. 

I really want to get back to my old optimistic self. 

Has anyone else ever lost their optimism or positive outlook for life?

110,"Do you think depression impacts language use? Why?

For example, Hancock's study on the language of psychopaths determins that there appears to be a difference in the lexis used by psychopaths and non-psycopaths. I've written a summary below:

Hancock’s study was to determine a lexical difference between psychopathic and non-psychopathic (the control group) murderers. All of the participants (14 psychopaths and 38 non-psychopaths) were male and did not differ vastly in regards to age. They had all admitted to their crimes and had volunteered for the study. 

The process was a face-to-face individual interview in which the participants were asked a variety of questions. The investigators were seeking any differences in speech, such as word choice and their use of conjunctions.

The study found that psychopaths did use language differently from the non-psychopathic control group. Psychopaths were more likely to use subordinating conjunctions and emphasised basic needs, such as food, sex, and shelter, whereas the control group focused their answers more on social needs, such as relationships and spirituality.

Their next step was to focus on the emotional expression of both groups. Here, psychopaths vastly differed from the control group. For example, they spoke in the past-tense, used more concrete nouns, and they used less positive and emotionally intense language. The data also suggested that psychopaths viewed their crime as more in the past and more psychologically distant than non-psychopaths. Finally, the study concluded that the psychopaths’ language was less fluent, with 33% more disfluency (such as “um” and “uh”) than the non-psychopathic group.

While there is no explanation for these results, the researchers concluded that there is a connection between mental health and language; that those with mental health disorders do use language differently than those without a mental illness.

I have read numerous articles regarding depression and language use, and most tend to agree that depression does impact language use. Now, I want to know personal experiences of lexical changes and depression.

112,"For quite a while now, I've been developing all these fears and imagining scenarios in my head related to my own intelligence.   
I either make connections from the past, compare myself to the wrong people, go in a pattern between feeling smart and dumb, come up with complex reasons why things would bother me or read articles online that cause me to fear things related to my IQ level.  


To clarify, I often times have reasons behind things that I forget to mention while posting these threads. So not ever single reason I have behind it will be listed down.  
Though sometimes I get thoughts in my head related to making mistakes, or people not taking me seriously (treating me as a naive person) if it ever turns out I'm not intelligent or anything. There have been times where every time I make a minor mistake I start over-thinking how much it actually defines me.   
And that's not all...  


&amp;#x200B;

I usually post threads on internet forums in order to preserve my own thoughts and ask questions related to myself that I don’t have the answers to. But if I were unintelligent or something, it wouldn’t matter anymore. There would literally be no point in caring about any of the thoughts in my head!  
They mean quite a lot to me.  


  


This one is rather difficult to describe…. But when I develop super weird tendencies that relieve me on an extreme level, I feel like a bunch of good things have to coexist with relief in order to be truly satisfied.   
I don't know whether this would classify as just a perfectionist tendency or a straight up OCD probably ( I get intrusive thoughts, and have been diagnosed in the past).  


&amp;#x200B;

Some of my goals for the future involve pursuing things that are at least a little bit intellectual (anything biology or psychology related), and most of my friends on the internet that I enjoy associating with are on the smart side. A huge fear of mine is being overly separate from my friends as far as abilities go.  
I have to be on the a similar level to be truly satisfied (though I would **tolerate** being 20 points lower at the maximum)  


&amp;#x200B;

At times I have a difficult time describing the thoughts and perceptions that mean the most to me, and if I turned out being dumb, nobody would probably take me seriously or just straight up judge my entire set of reasoning.  
As I've said, sometimes I go in an actual pattern between feeling sharp and feeling pretty stupid.  
And when I'm looking on the positive side of things, I'm always dying that the good thoughts reflect the truth more so than the negative ones.  
\-------------------

And to get to the things that actually trigger my fear, let's start off with some article titles that I've found online.   
I have a close relative who has schizophrenia, and apparently it can cause decline with age.  
I don't actually know whether or not I have it, though for at least 5 years I've been observing my own mentality and behavior of my past (as well as comparing it to my **most likely bullshit** diagnosis of HFA).  
From what I know, it would make logical sense for me to be a mildly psychotic person as opposed to an autistic one.  


I've also read somewhere that the lack of exercise and excessive screen time can harm my cognitive abilities. I typically experience problems related to laziness (can also be an apparent sign of efficiency and thinking associated with high intelligence) and computer addiction (which helps me escape my problems). As a result, I never get enough exercise.  


If I start exercising more often, could it boost my intelligence? Or am I basically doomed once any decline starts to occur?  
Every time something applies to me, I seriously want to know if I could make adjustments to it!  


My obsession with IQ is so major, that every time I run into an article with the word intelligence in it, I immediately feel like my chest is dropping. It's constantly in my head 24/7 (even when entirely different things are making me feel optimistic).   
\-------------------  


I'm somebody who typically enjoys imagining goals and exploring specific topics of my interests.  
I'm somebody who typically feels misunderstood based on the images and scenarios in my own head.  
If I was unintelligent, it wouldn't matter anymore.   
My passion for the world in general and psychology (or animal science) wouldn't matter! Throughout my childhood I was sometimes treated like a naive person. A huge fear is that it could've been for the bad reason.  


I keep running into a bunch of articles that scare the shit out of me. Especially considering I **may** actually have psychosis (which is what my dad has).  
But one time my extremely weird schizophrenic dad actually did surprisingly well on an IQ test, so perhaps it's possible for me as well?   


I'm always hoping that my complexity means something good as opposed to something bad.",31Jan2020,1
113,"People always distinguish between introversion and not liking people or crowds etc. They give the conventional description, that introverts are just de-energized by social interaction, not that they don’t enjoy parties and talking to people etc etc. My question is, what if I earnestly don’t enjoy interacting with most people. I don’t actively messing with anyone,  doing “ anti social” things, I just don’t enjoy spending time with most people, regardless of what my social battery is.

118,"Forgive me if I’m in the wrong place, but I’m assuming this issue has something to do with my mental health. If anyone has any suggestions for a better sub to ask this, please share. 

I’ve never had a close friend that I didn’t eventually wind up having sex with. No matter their gender or sexual orientation. This started when I was young. Maybe about 13. Even when I was younger than that, If I got close to someone, I would become sexually attracted to them. Even if I didn’t find them visually attractive. 

As I got older, this would happen even with people whom I wasn’t close to. If a guy or a lesbian gave me even the slightest bit of attention, I would immediately become sexually attracted to them. I wouldn’t always want a relationship or anything like that, but I would want sexual attention from them.

This has resulted in many ruined friendships and relationships over the years. 

I’ve never been sexually abused, that I can recall. I don’t really have a close relationship with either one of my parents. They’ve both hopped around from relationship to relationship for my entire life. To this day, neither one of them have ever been married but they are both currently in relatively unhealthy relationships.

I’m really bad at making and keeping friends as it is, and whenever I do finally develop a friendship, I ruin it with sex in one way or another. I don’t know what my problem is, but I would really like to fix it.

Any suggestions would help. I know I’m not going to be diagnosed with anything here or Reddit, but I would like to have to something that I can read up and do some research on. As of right now, I don’t really know where to start.",31Jan2020,1

As someone with CTPSD who used so drink herself to death, has an eating disorder, and also used to compulsively shop to try to deal with things, I’m beginning to realize how detrimental constantly having ads shoved in my face is for my recovery and mental health. 

For instance, I had a bit of a mental breakdown while I was on my university’s campus, so I went into a bathroom stall to process my breakdown in hiding. Once I became more coherent, I looked at the door of the stall and saw an ad for some alcohol brand, with the ad basically saying how their alcohol makes everything occasion better and will make you socially likable. 

It pisses me right off. People can’t even pee on my university’s campus without being told what they need to make their shitty, stressful lives better. No wonder mental health issues are on the rise! Companies are confusing people about what their actual problems are and making people think that mindless consumerism will solve everything. It’s exploitative and viciously feeds into itself.

128,"I've thought getting help for my mental health for a while now but never ended up going through, always just had this thought in the back of my mind that ""you're fine, this feeling will go away."" and like many people with this problem it didn't. Yesterday I had a deep conversation with my gf and It was a conversation we never really had before about my mental health, like shit that I never let out and stuff came out that I didn't even know I was feeling or how to put into words. In all, it was therapeutic because I let so much out and it felt so good to let it out to someone. And no bottling it up until I explode. We came to the conclusion that I would reach to a therapist and find the proper help for myself, in regards of my mental health. My gf is in full support of it too because she wants to see me do better.

 I'm doing that as of today and this time I'm promising myself that I will go through. My main concern now is how to tell my mother or how she'll feel. My mother and I never have talks about mental health, its like it doesn't exist. My mother's a closed book when it comes to emotions and I think i got some of that from her. Like I have seen my mother cry once in my 21 years of living. I'm also from a culture where mental health is not a topic of discussion, men don't talk about their emotions and if you do a lot of the times you're just labeled weak or you're just told that ""life is hard for everyone."" and that you're not really special because you're going through something.

My father's dead my father before deathkicked me and my mom outside the house when I was 3years old.I have a very complicated relationship with my mother I LOVE my mother the most in the world and I HATE her the most in the world sometimes I love her sometimes I hate her we always fight everyday she always think shes right and Screams really loud and keeps telling me how i am a failure,lazy and good for nothing the whole neighborhood heres her I always try to quiet her by putting my hand on her mouth but she starts screaming more loudly and says things like ""MY SON IS TRYING TO KILL ME"" it makes me look like the bad guy.I get ANGRY really easily by my mom so ANGRY that I bite my lips really hard my eyes pop out I start to lose control I says really bad things and I Think about hitting her but I never hit her whenever I am angry I always hit my self or the walls I dont know why do I do this I just cant stop my self whenever I lose control after  taking my anger out on myself or the walls I regret everything I feel like a horrible person I feel like a Monster but sometimes I put the blame on my mom (even though I know Its my fault)I always hit myself when I am angry I can get angry from basic things but I love my mom too when were not fighting which is rarely shes tells me she loves me the most in the world and shes the only person who loves me but whenever she does something that makes me angry(like telling me I am a failure)I get so angry that I start to hit myself whenever I hit myself I always feel like why I am hitting myself but I cant stop myself its like I lose control of my body.On onehand my mom tells me she loves me on the otherside when she is angry she tells me to kill myself but regardless I still love my mom and she loves me.

EMOTIONS:My emotions are a mess I can get angry really easily Its like I am always on the edge sometimes I am happiest person in the world sometimes I am so depressed I cant do anything I always feel empty and bored maybe this is because I don't have friends? I can fill this emptiness and boredom temporary by watching Anime and playing games.Everynight i cry and i think about my life recently I have been thinking about my school i havent been to school since last week I can never goto school for more than 3days straight and i have been thinking stuff like everyone is gonna laugh at me or hate me for not coming to school because of this i start to panic at night and cry and 2mins later i go from crying to being so happy like i am on drugs(i have never used drugs lol) i feel like nothing is gonna happen to me and everything gonna be fine and sometimes later the feeling is gone and I fell into depression and loneliness I am really desperate for love and affection I always have fantasies about having friends and gf and people laughing at my jokes even after this I have never thought about suicide I want to live and do stuff that I like but still I always feel like I am gonna die alone and no one is gonna come to my funeral. I can go from being happy to depressed to anxious in minutes

OTHER THINGS:I am really lazy I can never do things on time if I am not forced,I failed my exams I felt so shit that I prayed to god to give me one last chance and it was Announced that they were gonna retake exam but surprise surprise I didnt study even if I tried to i can never study after this I was given another chance to redeem my self but again I didn't study if someone tells me to do something in 12 hours and do something in 2 hours i will both finish them in the sametime lol

OTHER THINGS2: I do really irritating things like i wilI wash my hands 5 times or for 30 minutes,I always put my shoes in a manner where both shoes are equal if they are not equal I keep having thoughts about like I feel irritated that they are not equal or I think there not equal when are equal,I always put the mattress on the bed equal to the edge if I dont do these things I can never think straight I cant do anything I keep having these obsessive thoughts because of these things",31Jan2020,1
134,"I just had my first art therapy session. It went ok but I'm left a bit uncomfortable. My therapist insists that I have self esteem issues and feelings of unworthiness because of something I said. It was about my ability to socialize with others.

The thing is, I have noticed patterns in my interactions with others that are unhealthy. I don't think it's all me but I don't think I'm completely not wrong myself. I feel like my issues stem from bonding and trust disruptions from repeated trauma from birth until my twenties. I did used to have self esteem issues in my early 20s but some of my older friends really helped me work through it and I've actively worked on myself, so I really feel like I have solid grasp on who I am and a healthy self image. I worked on self respect and have eliminated several people in my life. 

I'm further confused because she even acknowledged that I speak my own truth despite possibly not having the desired outcome and said many women aren't comfortable with that. If I had self esteem issues, I likely wouldn't. Even when I'm depressed, I've chosen not to commit suicide *because* I like myself and think it would be a shame. 

She thinks my concerns with socializing are due to self worth issues. Meanwhile, I'm falling into social rejection patterns repeatedly and having a hard time making friends. My teacher suspected I had ADD when I was a kid. I personally think its more along those lines.

I feel a few things in regards to her perspective: I feel like my own intuition and concerns have been invalidated. I'm not sure treatment will be effective if her focus is my self esteem and not my social skills. My own goals won't be met. I'm frustrated too because I feel good about myself but she's insisting that I don't.

I think she has good intentions, but apparently her specialty is helping women work through self worth issues and I think she's projecting that onto me too. I'm not sure I should continue seeing her. I'm already annoyed and I already feel uncomfortable at possibly talking to her about kink and bdsm because I know she'll look negatively on that too. Bdsm isn't necessarily a self esteem or abuse thing but she seems like she would think so.

Should I give it longer because she's the expert? Or should I look for a therapist who can relate to me better?",31Jan2020,1

137,"I've been dealing with depression for the past few years. Stemming from a abusive childhood and recently. Financial and just life problems. Start of January I was transferred to somewhere quite far from my house. Making me spend more on public transport and because of the transfer I'm earning less. None of my superiors listen to me and I had a breakdown my first in years a few weeks ago. Was crying and shouting and screaming at the top of my lungs at a lake. I was just angry why is this happening to me and then started punching and hitting my forehead on a wall eventually just calming down and going home. I have been noticing drastic changes in myself. I get irritated by the littlest things (sound of a spoon hitting a plate. Water dripping etc etc) and I have never been a violent person but I've been having thoughts of hurting myself or worse other people just like strangling the life out of them I also have not been sleeping AT ALL in the night but sleeping away in the daytime I don't know why. I've been smoking like a chimney and drinking and taking more of my heart medication than recommend. I'm afraid in losing control over myself over my brain. I have tried to get help went to The Institute of Mental health and they have me anti depressants which my mom threw away because she says I'm faking it and anyways those medicines will make me weak and like a zombie. She used to be a nurse and thinks that institute is a mental hospital like those you see in them horror movies. I'm so lost I'm so afraid I have no one to talk to. All my ""friends"" tell me to man up and that I'm being a pussy because only girls do drama like this and guys are tough and don't.

Idk if that sounds selfish or mean..By that I just mean that if there were more friends the possibility to be left alone is smaller: If one friend is busy working and another is on vacation it wouldn't necessarily mean I had to stay alone.

I don't even know what I have anymore, I get anxiety, OCD, depression, so overall I think I'm just a little bit of a mess. I just don't really want to be alive anymore. I dropped out of college a year ago, and since then, I've spent almost every day sitting in the same chair in my house and I feel like I just can't move half the time. I don't find joy in most of the things I used to and I push away everybody who could possibly care about me, leaving me with no-one. I hate myself so much. I keep hurting people. My weight goes up and down, since I'm often sleeping through the day, and just don't get up to eat. My sleeping pattern goes all over the place. I've tried to force myself to throw up a lot, and every now and then tried to starve myself. I feel like I'm two different people, and while one of me is fucking up my life, the other is watching and screaming at me for everything I'm doing wrong. I've self harmed before, started cutting my arms, but I haven't done that in a while. I seem to have subconsciously found other ways of harming myself though, like punching the wall and telling myself it was an accident, or pinching my skin, or digging my nails into my palms, or tearing hairs out. I'm also pretty scared to go near knives in case I do something to myself. I also seem to punish myself emotionally by constantly putting myself in situations that I know are going to fuck me over. I've been suicidal a lot. The only reason I know I wouldn't actually do it is because it would tear my family apart, since they'd all have something to blame each other for. I constantly think though, what if I could just disappear, without hurting anyone? It's a no brainer for me. But since I don't feel like killing myself is the right option just yet, I was hoping people could give me some advice. What's the best way to go about getting antidepressants?

150,"Hi there,

I've been depressed from a trauma for a very long time now. Certain events always feed it, again and again. I've been to therapy on and off for years and it helped, but still, sometimes, I get hit hard by a low. At this point it's like lucid dreaming: fully aware of what is happening, working against it, getting better, until I can finally snap out of it, after a few days. After the last time I felt exhausted, a bit frustrated, moody. I want to stop falling into this cycle. I feel the urge to get rid of the negativity inside of me, get it out, put it into something that makes sense to me, that I can show to others so they will understand how I feel. It's like knowing what you want to say but you absolutely have no clue on how to open your mouth.

What I've never tried before, yet seen countless times in movies, is to put my feelings into art. That's not something I'd do in a normal therapy session, that's something for behind closed doors of a sanatorium, right? At least I never did that, neither in behavioural therapy, nor in analytical...

So I want to try out different outlets, be it writing, drawing, painting, music... but I need someone to tell me how to start and prompts like ""draw what you feel"" but more specific, because I have absolutely no idea how I'm going to do this. But I need to do something. I have enough free time to try one new thing each weekend and see how that works for me.

Can someone help me...?",31Jan2020,1

This....

this never would’ve happened if I weren’t toxic. Like, I feel no empathy or sympathy, and actually, I sometimes I enjoy making other people upset and I feel like it’s because I used to be bullied and ignored and right now my parents don’t seem to actually care that much about any mental problems I have.

My low self-esteem is destroying my life

I’m 36 now,

I have always felt that I should impress others, or be someone to be accepted by others.

Even when people around me like me I’m hiding my true self. 

I always think that why other people deserve es this and that

I have all the talents needed to succeed. But my perfectionist thinking is letting me down. I’m harsh to myself.

I have always starting to feel insecure when I’m almost making it with something. Being it with career, hobbies or anything else in life.

My biggest passion has been music. I have heard from tons of people dräng the years that I have talent. But I always think that I’m missing something.

During the last few years, I have been more and more isolated with my thoughts. 

My low self-esteem has not gotten me to a point in life where I'm happy. I think about lost opportunities and chances in life. What if this, what that.

I feel like I have wasted so much potential by ruminating all the time.

I have so much talents just waiting to be seen. Career, relationships etc.

But my negative self-talk is sometimes killing me. I have by the way high-functioning autism and been semi-anxious my entire life.

In summary here are just some examples of what I Think

I always end my sentences with “or”, like I need the approval of other people around me that what I say and think is fine

**I** **compare yourself with others.**

**I** **cannot handle genuine compliments.**

**I give up too soon**

**I’m indecisive in the midst of simple decisions.**

**I’m are afraid to contribute my opinion in conversation.**

**I** **take constructive criticism too personally.**

**I back down during a disagreement to appease another person.**

**I believe the world is against me and people are against me**

**Social isolation**

Anyone can relate and what has been the most effective way to get out of this spiral to increase self-esteem and self-worth?

156,"I have taken the MMPI-2 twice during inpatient hospital settings - once in Feb 2015 and once in Feb 2017.

I also remember him pointing out that my score for schizoid was high, but nothing really came of that.

If that is all I heard in terms of results, does that mean that there weren’t glaring results that pointed to some type of personality disorder or any other type of diagnosis?

157,"Disclaimer: Post is longer than I expected. You don't have to read it.

Today I went to work to bring a part of a prototype we are building to a coworker as a good favor. I had the part at home, to work on it a couple of hours and I wanted to study for my exam in 10 days. When I went to work and got off the train I had that feeling of dizziness and loss of control - as I would faint at any moment. I went outside the train station quickly and didn't know what to do. I smoked a cigarette quickly and calmed down a little. Then I took the next train to work, got off after one station and walked the remaining way to work, which took about 5 minutes. I brought the part to the coworker and chatted 10 minutes with him, while my heart was still racing. I drank a glass of water to help my completely dry mouth and then headed back home. I felt a little bit better on the way back and even chatted with an old lady on the train for some minutes because something funny happened. I was telling myself all the time ""only 3 stations left, you can do it"", ""only 2 left "", ... .

Right before I neede to get off the train - before home - I felt that dizziness again. I walked to my bicycle feeling more and more weird, everything was spinning and I felt light-headed. I felt like I would fall to the ground at any moment, but I told myself anything would be fine and I can do it.

I unlocked my bike and rode home as fast as I could. I could barely breathe and I felt like I need to puke at any moment because my mouth was so dry. After 5 minutes in this state, I got home, rushed inside and sat down, wondering what happened. I thought maybe I haven't eaten enough and this was the reason for my dizziness. I ate some fruit and some sugar and drank water, sat down and I started to feel better a little bit.

I have had many - I would say - mild panic attacks, but not like this. The feeling of anxiety is something I have all the time. The weird thing is that it is sometimes gone. E.g. when I was afraid to go to a party that was far away, where I couldn't leave the situation quickly, or where it would be unpolite or weird to leave the situation and I went despite my anxiety and had a great night. The way back from these events, where I had the most anxiety going and had overcome it, was a great feeling.

I would have gone to a birthday party today, where all my friends are today, but I just canceled it. Normally, I would go despite this anxiety. I read online that this would help, to force yourself into these situations you are afraid of and not let the anxiety restrict your behavior, but I still felt weird - nauseous and with a racing heart. That's the reason I feel bad to cancel my plans today. I canceled it because the incident today was too much for me. I hope that doesn't make anything worse.

What if I cancel any plans now? What if that's the incident that makes my life that's slightly controlled by anxiety and panic completely ruined?

I have too many things that bother me going on in my life right now.

My mother had cancer and survived it, but needed to see the doctor lately, because something is wrong with her liver - nothing live threatening and objectively nothing to worry about, but hearing about that reminded me of her cancer illness and it threw me back into this feeling of nearly losing your mother.

Additionally, my father was a monster. Hit her, my brother and me. The police came often, but they did not do very much, only fixing the door that he kicked and broke. They didn't do anything, because it was his property.

He had an affair with an employee of my mother when she was in the hospital for cancer. That was 10 years ago and since then, my father sues her and me for anything he could find.

I work, but I don't make money off of it, because there are legal cases going on - long story. The main case going on is that my father needs to pay child support, because I am still in university and under 25, which is the law here. Besides that, he bombards me with letters from his lawyer. E.g. I have like $200 in my bank account and got a letter a month ago from the lawyer of my father demanding $13k to pay. I couldn't understand the 10 pages long letter. Since then there are legal cases going on, which worked out in my favor. I don't need to pay anything. The lawyer and cost of the case (cost of the court) need to be paid by him and not me, the judge ruled.

Last week my lawyer called me that I might need to go to court and sit in front of the judge and my father, I said I can't do that. I would rather loose the case. He said that this would be very unlikely and he would handle it for me and would do anything to not put me in this situation -  he's a very nice guy.

Besides that, there are many more things going on. Brother had a heart attack 3 months ago, I needed to change my subject in university, because I failed too much, my twin brother got diagnosed with autism and my stepfather is very harsh to me and my mother, which reminds me of my father.

I didn't want to make this so long, but it felt good to write that down. I haven't told anyone that much -ever. Even if one person reads this, I would feel better.

Objectively my life is pretty good.

I am only 21 and work with people that have a Ph.D. or master in computer science. They always say I know more than them and I can stay in the company forever even if don't get better.My boss even told me some weeks ago that he sees a lot of potential in me and wants to help me get better leading people and sees me as the boss of one of his 4 companies in the next 5 years. Since I was 12, at least 50 % of my day was learning new things regarding computer science. Like coding and developing stuff, but I feel like that hasn't paid off and learning all of that was a mistake.

University is pretty good too. I feel like I understand everything well, despite not often going there much and learning from home.

Friends are good too. I have like 5 good close friends.

I don't know what to think anymore. I feel exhausted and confused about life. I feel like it's unnecessary to worry that much. Life is pretty good, but I don't know how to handle the emotional stress and all of these things.

Sorry for the long post. That felt good to write that down. All I wrote, was stuff I kept only for me so far. Maybe someone can help me understand all of that and give me another opinion because I feel exhausted re-thinking all of that every day again.

I remember headlines without the the story the context  and it's driving me insane that a chunk of my life is gone. And when I sit think about what happened in grade 8th I think it's because I was severely depressed. That was because I changed schools and  I was very welcomed by the student and I made barely any friends. Things at home were bad because my aunt got cancer and stayed with during her illness. And seeing her during my illness made me feel bad because my problems are nothing compared to hers. So I kept the depression inside and didn't seek help because I thought I didn't deserve.

I don't even know what I have anymore, I get anxiety, OCD, depression, so overall I think I'm just a little bit of a mess. I just don't really want to be alive anymore. I dropped out of college a year ago, and since then, I've spent almost every day sitting in the same chair in my house and I feel like I just can't move half the time. I don't find joy in most of the things I used to and I push away everybody who could possibly care about me, leaving me with no-one. I hate myself so much. I keep hurting people. My weight goes up and down, since I'm often sleeping through the day, and just don't get up to eat. My sleeping pattern goes all over the place. I've tried to force myself to throw up a lot, and every now and then tried to starve myself. I feel like I'm two different people, and while one of me is fucking up my life, the other is watching and screaming at me for everything I'm doing wrong. I've self harmed before, started cutting my arms, but I haven't done that in a while. I seem to have subconsciously found other ways of harming myself though, like punching the wall and telling myself it was an accident, or pinching my skin, or digging my nails into my palms, or tearing hairs out. I'm also pretty scared to go near knives in case I do something to myself. I also seem to punish myself emotionally by constantly putting myself in situations that I know are going to fuck me over. I've been suicidal a lot. The only reason I know I wouldn't actually do it is because it would tear my family apart, since they'd all have something to blame each other for. I constantly think though, what if I could just disappear, without hurting anyone? It's a no brainer for me. But since I don't feel like killing myself is the right option just yet, I was hoping people could give me some advice. What's the best way to go about getting antidepressants? My local GP is shit, so they probably wouldn't prescribe it unless they saw me on a ledge with a rope around my neck 🙄 if you've got any ideas or advice, please let me know, in comments or dms x",31Jan2020,1
162,"Wishing I didn't exist in the world is a thought that is becoming more and more frequent in my mind.  I feel I have no self worth or self confidence or self esteem in who I am as a person and what I contribute to the world.  I feel often my feelings are not valid in my relationship.  I feel I have no value.  I struggle with wanting my partner to see what's upsetting me in our relationship and help to change that and also realising that he is who he is and shouldn't change and if I had any sense of self worth I would know that I am valid without needing to hear it from him.  I know  I need to work on myself but I DON'T KNOW HOW.  That's where the hopelessness arises.  I don't know how to have cottage of conviction.  I don't know who the fuck I am out why I'm even here.  I feel failure on a daily basis, as a mother and as a daughter.  But then some  days i feel totally fine and think what was I worried about.  But honestly the emptiness and the feeling low are far to common.  I think of that line in forest Gump when Jenny and forest pray in the corn field and Jenny says,  ""dear God make me a bird so I can fly far far away from here. "" I feel that.  The worst of it all is that I have a beautiful  life,  with 3 beautiful children a roof over our heads so why should I feel this way.  I just wanted to put this out in the world.

163,"I'm a 25 year old man living in the UK. I started using online gay chat rooms when I was 16 and when I was around 17 I started talking with a man from Chicago. He had a nice voice and I enjoyed talking with him a lot. I've struggled with my mental health my whole life and I've often felt alone and isolated so he gave me a lot of respite from that. We became what I thought were good friends and I would talk with him every day. 

When I was 21 I flew to Chicago to meet him and I knew straight away that I wasn't comfortable and I wanted to go home. Unfortunately I felt trapped with him so I just tried to make the best of it. Over the course of the time with him he started to make me more uncomfortable and it became clear that he wanted to engage in sexual activity. I tried to make it as clear as possible that I wasn't interested but he continued to make advances. I had no money to stay anywhere else or catch a flight home so I was trapped.

On the last day I was with him he crawled into bed with me and pulled me against him. I just froze, I had no idea what to do. I have never been more uncomfortable in my life, I wanted to die. I won't go into more detail but he touched me inappropriately to put it politely.

I ended up coming home shaken and never told anyone about this. To this day my family think I had a nice holiday meeting a friend online. I blamed myself for everything that happened and carried the guilt and shame with me.

169," 

From the title I'm sure that you must be perplexed. A 16-year-old can be displeased with life? Does depression even exist among teenagers? 

Well unfortunately it does in my case, and I've been unhappy for these past few years. My depression and anxiety are both based around school. I constantly feel these emotions when in school. Why is this you may ask. I can base it off primarily: 

* I literally despise myself and will murder myself over the slightest mistakes that I make. This results in great anxiety around exams or most school endeavours. 
* I have no friends (barring one person who goes to a seperate school). I think this is because I have symptoms of autism. Not a full-blown diagnosis mind you but enough to cause social difficulties. People in my school don't seem to like me.  I often feel bullied and struggle to understand these people.
* I'm gay. I go to an all-boys school and have all these futile crushes. I'm out to no one except that friend I just mentioned. My sexuality is bothering me a lot more as of late, as I see guys my age going out with girls, while I stay at home alone.

In essence those are the main problems of mine, oversimplified might I add. I really think that my self-esteem issues are the most crippling. I am a perfectionist who is never pleased and never gives himself a break. I feel relentless anxiety and depression over school and my social life to the point where I have contemplated self-harm and suicide.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",31Jan2020,1
170,"This situation is maybe a bit strange but I could really use an outside perspective and some advice from anyone that's gone through something similar. I'm going to keep it vague enough that anyone involved doesn't recognize the story entirely...


I'm living with a hoarder of sorts. I had a relative that was down on their luck and needed a place to stay. We have a spare room in the house we own and I am more than happy to have them stay here. 
They are funny as heck, keep shared spaces cleaned, help me with random errands and what not. They're great and I love them. 
So the problem is that I was trying to respect the fact that the spare room was 'their room' and not a place I could invite myself into. I really wanted them to feel like this was home. After a few weeks of them staying here there was a VERY POTENT smell coming from their room. I said I was collecting all the garbage to put in the bin outside and if it was ok if I went in their room and they said 'of course'. Once I entered the room.... my lord..... the garbage... I shit you not.. I used FIVE BIG BLACK GARBAGE BAGS to haul all the trash out and only about one bag of it was actual trash. The rest was ROTTEN food. Now I'm not talking old stale chips bags, I'm talking some girl interrupted shit with rotting meat from half eaten rotisserie chickens carcasses, take out food containers half full with rotting food, drink cups completely full of mold (shoved under the bed, under piles of clothes, literally squirreled away and hidden) I basically pulled every single thing out of that room and cleaned in including having to wash the carpets, furniture and walls to get the smell out.


Mice and roaches are a real thing that I don't want in my house.. so as nice as I could I brought up what I found with them and we had a conversation about how things can't be left in that kind of condition and that they can have a space in the fridge or a cupboard in the kitchen, whatever they needed and it was a good conversation and in the grand scheme... they've gotten a bit better but... now I just straight up ask to clean the room once a month or just go into the room every time they're gone and pull rotten food out from under the bed. They've never questioned me doing this and I feel like I'm imposing on their personal space but at the same time... houses are expensive and I don't want this room to be trashed.


The real problem is this: obviously there's some kind of eating disorder going on here if they're hiding mass amounts of food (unhealthy foods). They eat super clean when they're around myself or other people but it's an outrageous amount of food that's being eaten and hidden in the room. They have eating disorders on their side of the family that's resulted in deaths and I just need to know this: what can I do to help them? how do I ask them if they need help? I already feel like maybe I'm stepping on toes with the cleaning although I'm assured I'm not (by them). This is one of my favorite people and by talking with people in their family it seems that this has always been an issue for them. They've dealt with a few traumas in their life and I think this might be some kind of coping mechanism. I just need to know how to go about offering help in the right way.",31Jan2020,1
171,"I've always been lazy, I studied the bare minimun in school, and still do so in college, but it feels like it's getting worse and worse to the point of me wanting to do a bunch of stuff and instead do nothing for the whole day.

There's also something that I just noticed recently, like when you go and open the fridge every several minutes if for some magical reason food appears. The problem I have is better said with an example:

""I wanna do X, but first I need Y thing"", so I look for Y, find it, wander around, and then find a comfy place to check my phone, then I remember I wanted to do X, so I go back to my room, check my phone again and spend 10 minutes browsing twitter before going back to what I wanted to do.. &gt;!or not doing so entirely.!&lt;

Also, this might be an influential factor, but I daydream.. alot, it's probably the thing I do the most during the day (I may or may not have daydreamed about the potential outcomes of this post..).

While this not may seem so severe, but I wanted to do so much. I wanted to get better at studying, maybe develop some skills, but the whole of 2019 (except for a sport that I got into), is me basically in my bed daydreaming of what I could've done, and it's taking a heavy toll in my own self esteem and my ability to progress like a functioning member of society and student..",31Jan2020,1
172,"Long story short - I recently got new neighbors. It's a family of a mother (probably 60s) a daughter (probably low 20s) and a son (probably teenager)

The person in question is the daughter. People in our neighborhood recently called the cops on the daughter because she was wondering in the streets, stripping nude, falling against cars, laying down in the road, etc. Her mother even came outside and said something along the lines of ""Oh look, shes dancing in the street again!""  Most of the neighbors thought she was on drugs. The cops came and took her away. A couple days later her brother let us know that shes schizophrenic and that they are sorry for what happened. When they first moved in, she came down to my apartment to ask to call her mom (who was at work) because ""she smoked meth and its making her freak out"" which is why I'm wondering if the brother was lying or idk.

 It's been about three weeks since the cops took her away, and today is her first day back. She's doing the same thing. In the streets, dancing around and laughing at the cars dodging her, eating grass, etc. She's fully clothed this time. 

So I'm not sure what we can do. Obviously her mother doesn't seem to care about her wellbeing. The sibling is the same. The hospital/cops didn't keep her for long. Is there anything I can do besides calling the cops? I'm genuinely worried for her. We live right off one of the main streets in town, and it's always busy. Her running into the streets is terrifying me. I've tried to get her to come sit on my patio so she doesn't get hurt, but she ignores me and walks further down/in the street. I've gone up to the apartment and tried to talk to the mother about getting her out of the street, and the mother just basically says she'll be okay.

In case it's useful, we live in California. (Northern CA)

TLDR: Neighbors mentally ill daughter (and/or drug addict) is running into the busy street and laying down in the road. Her family just lets her do this. Who can I call, asides from the police so she can get some help? Or do I mind my own business?",31Jan2020,1

177,"Lately it felt as if everything was getting me down. My boyfriend of three years left me because he realised he never loved me in the first place and was just bored, then when I went on a date with someone to take my mind off him I heard through the grapevine that this guy didn’t even like me to begin with. I would often think about my ex and when I was contemplating him and what happened a man old enough to be my dad walked up to me and called me beautiful, clearly half drunk and I completely lost it; was I destined to only find love from creeps on the street? Not only that, but my mom doesn’t want to talk to me after I ditched my promising career as a lawyer to follow my passion of infrastructure technology, saying that she’s “devastated” on me and that I’m “making the worst fucking mistake of [my] life”. My dad is also very tight on funds at the moment, and while I’m waiting for my job to kickstart I feel like a leech and I hate it, especially that I sit at home  isolated with my thoughts day after day while he goes to work. Every day I have been extremely close to fucking ending this vicious cycle and offing myself.

But while I stood in the supermarket queue today, buying my binge food of cookies and chocolate milk, a baby smiled and laughed at me. Their mother was getting bags from under the item belt, so the baby turned to me instead, smiled, waved and giggled. And I don’t know, something about that changed my perspective. For once I felt like the world wasn’t full of hatred and scum, and that there was pureness and gold within the hearts of people, too. I could finally see that people aren’t born spiteful, and that no one is two dimensional, everyone has thoughts and reasons why they do things. I went home that day, drank my chocolate milk and made chicken burgers for me and my dad so we could sit in the living room and watch the old Alien movies together like we used to; I texted my mom and apologised for not discussing my plans with her first, but that I wouldn’t be doing this if I wasn’t sure; I booted up my PC and spoke to my old video game friends just so I could talk to someone instead of surrounding myself in silence.

178,"Hello everyone! As a title says I would like that someone far experienced than me helps me with identifying the condition (or more of them) that I have. I know that the best thing I could do is to go to the professional which job is to do that, but since I live in a country where a psychiatrist only gives medications without trying to really help (at least that's the way with my grandma) I believe it's better this way. I'll try to describe my life and my feelings as best as I can so it will be easier for you to determine the condition.  


I am male, 25 years old. I live with my family (parents and grandparents) in the same house for the whole life (that's pretty normal here), but since I was little I had ""problems"" that other kids don't want to play with me and call me various names (I had big ears, by the years my head grew up to their size xD) and my parents are deaf (the kids are brutal so most of them made fun of my parents)  which hurt me a lot.  
As I grew older (7-8 y/o) I started going on ballroom dance classes, and from that moment add ""faggot and moron (but in terms that I am retarded)"" as an insult to earlier insults.  
Fast forward to high school, in the meantime, I can say that I closed into myself a bit, never had a lot of friends, though of myself that I was funny (although I had a weird sense of humor, mostly dark humor, was an average student in school but as the teachers said highly intelligent since I was achieving higher scores without learning much than some students who learned maybe as twice as myself but were hardly any better than me)  
Now, highschool (we here have tests in which you achieve some score and based on that score you chose which high school you would like to go into) I did that test average, but there was a mistake in the grading and I got into ""car mechanic"" class in which only bad students went. The principal of the high school offered me a chance to switch class and go to the class I wanted but I refused and said ""who knows why is this situation good"", as a class where only average to bad students go, it was rather easy for me to be the best in the class without much studying. You may think that this is good, well no, they soon started mocking me that I am ""genius"" but in a bad way, like they thought that I think that I am better than them.  
During high school, I had one big trauma, my father (have problems with alcohol) got drunk and started arguing with family and broke the glass with his hand (he does this so that he doesn't hit somebody else, he did that for the first time when I was 6, and then he once hit my mother also when I was 5-6; *I realized that I didn't give you my fathers background, but average alcoholic that get aggressive when he drinks) and the glass cut his hand really badly and he almost bled to death.*  
After that, he stopped drinking for several years but then again started drinking when my sister from my aunt was born.  
Also one time after he started drinking again he attacked my mother and my grandma and I stepped in and pushed him so that he doesn't harm them, I was very close of hitting him, but didn't. My sister called the police and we all went to the police. *Here I believe that I got PTSD from that event since after that I was really lost and apathetic for some time*  
FF to 2017, I met one girl who had a really jerk boyfriend (he was/is punker) from another city who controlled her every step, and I kinda liked her, I helped her to get the courage to dump him and we started dating, I committed way to much and even neglected my job (I am a freelance video editor, so I really don't have working hours). I wanted to help her so bad that I did everything she wanted which lead to me not speaking to any girls she think I might like and want her to spend all the time together with me which made me feel really bad, but I was thinking that she would change.  
FF to summer of 2019, I was feeling really bad and I decided that I would like to see how down can I feel before I brek (snap) mentally.   
September 2019, several days before my birthday my grandad wasn't feeling right and we take him to the hospital.  
**Grandad** *the person who was always there for me and the person which I loved the most, I look like him and he was my greatest support for my whole life, when I decided to quit my job and pursue freelance career he was the only one that supported me*  
And then on my birthday (how ironic), we found out that he has a lung cancer, only one of his lungs was working and he had water in lungs, and they are sending him to the specialized hospital in the capital for treatment. Since I was the only one who was available (since I can work from anywhere) I went with him, for 3 weeks I was there for him every day in the hospital and I believe that it was much easier for him that he had someone who was there for him. After those three weeks and all the analyses they did, we returned home and waited for a date when he will go to start receiving medications.  
 November 2019, grandad was getting weaker and weaker, couldn't walk alone and as days passed couldn't even get up from the bed to sit, but he insisted that he tries which resulted of him passing out almost every time he tried to get up, and I even had to do a CPR and I managed to save him twice.  
But unfortunately, he passed away on 11th of November, on my hands. This was and still is a shock for me since I never experienced the death of a close relative.  


This was my life up to this day, and here what I think of myself.  
I am introvert, I don't like places with a lot of people but again I could easily become the most talkative person if the surrounding is the way I like it.  
I have anxiety when I'm supposed to go and do some official talking or speak to phone with someone, but in the years I learned how to fake this and since it's easier to look happy than to talk to others about your problems I always seemed like a happy person to others when in fact I never was.  
I would like to do some things, but my family and the persons around me always say ""why would you do this or why are you doing this"" and I don't want to hear that and I always give up from doing things I like.  
Lately, my life came to this routine ""Work 7-9 hours, then go to my gf, sleep at her place, wake up, come home to work and like that in circles"" without any ""me"" time that would relax me.  
For example my grandad was a carpenter and a painter and I would like to work with wood and to fix things. He also gave me his moped and I would like to get the licence for it and drive it but my father will say ""why are you spending money on that, you don't need that, save money"" but it's my earned money.  
And we have grandma who don't like my gf, and she wants that I be at home all the time.

Our chat quickly moved onto my current mood and I told my GP that I had a plan and that I had really lost all hope for the first time in my 27 years of life. He told me he was incredibly worried and the mental health response team in my city advised him to tell me to give them a call because they’d assess me straight away and get me immediate help and that they would be better equipped than sending me to A&amp;E. I tried to refuse to call them but I humoured him and they gave me an appointment for 6 hours later so I sat at work and I did my job knowing full well that I was safer there than leaving and being by myself. 

I got a call one hour before my appointment was due by a man who told me that they didn’t need to see me today because I’ve got a medical review booked next Thursday now and so they wouldn’t be much help for me today until they could assess my medication. I burst into tears on the phone and told him that my doctor had told me to call them because of how suicidal I am and that I was at serious risk of either harming myself or worse before then. I tried to be honest and explain how desperate I was and he raised his voice at me down the phone and told me I was guilt tripping him into getting an appointment sooner. I tried to explain to him that I didn’t care about my medication or any review, I just needed a safe space and for someone to give me some hope which he took for me saying that I didn’t want their services and when I tried to honestly state that I wasn’t sure if I’d make it by tomorrow, he threatened to cancel my appointment for next week and almost tricked me into telling him I’d be there and then said I couldn’t be that bad then. He told me they’d provide me a safe space over the phone for up to an hour if I needed but they couldn’t do anything for me in terms of keeping me alive. 

I don’t know what to do anymore, I really don’t. 
The only reason I am here and writing this post is because my boyfriend is here and when he’s not, I’m passed around my family because no one will even leave me alone long enough to go to the toilet. 
I feel like this is my last plea for something. 
I wish someone would say an exact date and time that I would get to and I would never be sad again because then I really think I’d stay. 

Sorry for such a long post, no one else gets it like you guys do 🧡",31Jan2020,1
