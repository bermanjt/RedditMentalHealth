0,"I’ve been seeing her for less than two months, but wow. This sucks. Both times I overslept after being exhausted, between work and my mental health being shit and getting maybe 3-5 hours of sleep a night. And she knows all of my issues.

Both times she basically told me that her time is precious and her sessions could be the difference between someone living or not, and then told me to find counseling through a community mental health service instead. 

What the fuck.",03Jul2020,1
1,"Hi all, this may not sound too serious compared to other issues on here, so don’t worry about answering if there are other posts that need attention, but here goes... 

So I’ve just finished university, and managed to come out with a decent grade (hopefully). All in all, it has been a very bumpy road from start to finish which has lasted almost 7 years, from multiple jobs to overwhelming stress from balancing my priorities... It’s just not been at all straight forward and I’ve struggled a lot with the deterioration of my mental health, depression and the breakdown of relationships. It’s done now though, and I feel a lot of relief. However... 

I’ve been having strange ‘episodes’ as such, in the past month since finishing the degree, whereby I get an overwhelming feeling of panic, dread and anxiety whenever I look at/think about certain pieces of university work I’ve done, notes from lectures, scenarios I faced at work, and so forth. Most of the time it feels involuntary - like I’ll be doing something completely unrelated and my mind will suddenly fixate on something that will trigger these feelings, such as my dissertation for example. 

Looking back at my final dissertation in particular brings on these feelings fairly strongly and consistently, and I don’t really know how to explain it. It’s all fairly cut and dry, like I’ll look at/think of something that will trigger these feelings, then I’ll just take a moment and it’ll kinda fade out.  

This experience is similar to one I’ve had in the past following a motorcycle accident. Following my accident, I’d have daydreams at random points in the day or occasionally nightmares when I’d kinda relive the accident as it happened, when invoked the exact same feelings of panic, dread and anxiety that I’m feeling now... 

Has anyone else faced anything similar? Or could anyone identify what this could be? 

I’m quite embarrassed about this, hence the anonymous Reddit post asking for advice... 

But yeah, any insight would be greatly appreciated - thanks for hearing me out ✌️",03Jul2020,1
2,"Just like the title says what happens when you can't afford therapy anymore? I may have to stop seeing mine in a few weeks. 

I feel nervous and panicked because I've been seeing him weekly for a year. What happened when you stopped going? (would like positive things) I'm a little scared.

We just might not have the insurance anymore, and I feel like a mess.  Please tell me how you turned your life around with seeing a therapist/having to stop therapy.",03Jul2020,1

4,"I was a curvy 13 year old and felt really fat and ugly once I was 120lbs at 5ft1. I severely restricted my eating habits for 8/9 months at 14 until I was 100lbs and I was prone to dizziness and worried so much about gaining any weight ever again. While I had a healthy BMI technically, I looked way too thin in hindsight. I was hungry so much, wouldn't allow myself to even have ice cream at a family wedding for fear I would become ""fat"" again. I had a shorter lived phase at 17 for 3 months,  where I saved photos of skinny celebrities and used them to motivate myself not to eat. I would limit myself to 1200 calories for 2 or 3 days in a row, and then binge on 2400 calories one night and feel crazy guilty and worthless. It was horrible and I obsessed over calories 2 or 3 hours a day.

Is this normal teenage girl stuff or did I have a problem in hindsight? I'm a Size 2 now, I don't allow myself to check my weight anymore in case I panic and I haven't binged/restricted in a cycle or worried about getting fat in 3 years.

Every day feels the same as the previous one, nothing makes me ""happy"" anymore, I can't enjoy anything, I can't see to future for me, I don't have hope for anything good anymore ... There's to much to write. I don't understand ""happiness"", people start a family, live an average life and then die without achieving anything.  Even if I would like to devote my life to something I like, unfortunately, there is no such thing that would interest me.  In summary, I'm hopeless and each next day is getting worse. Sometimes I can't control myself, I go crazy, not once have thought about suicide but somehow I'm still alive.",03Jul2020,1
6,"I’ve dealt with mental health and suicide for almost my whole life. From environmental factors and genetics. It’s very real. I have bad days, horrible horrible days. However, I’ve convinced myself that I can’t kill myself. And I say it with confidence, because it can’t really hurt. I know it sounds crazy. I’m not cured. I still get suicidal thoughts I still experience my illness. However, my reasonability has become so powerful that I literally can’t.. kill myself... like it doesn’t become an option. I’ve realized I don’t want to die I just didn’t want to suffer, you know? And this mindset has helped me become mentally stronger, more positive, and healthier. It’s so obvious but I understand how hard it is and how much the giving up seems so easy. Of course I still think you should seek help. It doesn’t hurt to get help. I know I say this like it’s so easy but I know it’s not. But I think it’s important to give yourself that chance. To stop seeking blame at yourself or others, because I know I did and probably will again. When you’re hard on yourself you simply excuse your actions, but you know, it’s not your fault that you feel shitty. You have to take things as opportunities to grow. The term “it gets better” is a little nonspecific to me because it makes the world seem all rainbow and sunshine when it’s not. When you’re simply expecting all good you become unprepared for the bad because that’s how things are. Good and bad. And you live for you and along the way there’s people you love, happy experiences, but also struggles. It all seems like common knowledge but for me, it was easy to forget. I don’t know if this is helpful at all but it doesn’t hurt to try and I say this all from a place of love. I’ve been pushing and have been clean from SH and attempts for a year. Take care of yourself and be kind, when you get the strength. I truly believe that there’s good solutions to everything. I’d like to think that, that’s true.",03Jul2020,1

8,"For the past year or so I've been damn near obsessed with the idea that I'm developing schizophrenia but at the same time my mind quickly counters my reasons for thinking so. This sounds horrible to say but part of me wants to have it. I've never fit in or felt at home in the world and the thought of being able to find the illusion of interaction within myself sounds so nice. Basically I'd rather interact with delusions/hallucinations than have anything to do with the outside world. I know that's a dumb thing to think as there are people who genuinely suffer with this condition but none the less I crave it in a weird way. I guess my question is should I be worried about this sustained thought loop or just ride it out? I could go on and on about the ""signs"" that one side of my mind sees and all the counter points that the other side of me sees but ill spare yall. Idk I guess maybe im just weird lol.

9,"I’m about to be 15, yet specific, normal sounds scare me. As far as I know, there is only two different situations that trigger this fear, but there may be more that I just don’t know of.
Usually loud sounds don’t really trigger me, but specifically loud shouting (out of anger) and music that is turned up too loud really scares me and I want to get away from it ASAP. This causes me to have the urge to cry and I instantly receive a headache. People talking loudly (e.g. in a crowd, in a room with a group of parents talking/laughing loudly, kids in school during P.E. class) gives me an awful headache and sometimes my headaches get so bad, I become emotional (want to cry), however this hasn’t really happened for a while now, thankfully. Although when little children are screaming around me, I don’t really mind it that much, I don’t understand it. One more thing, I also get emotional when I get told off for doing something wrong in school, like when I get pulled out of the classroom for something (which doesn’t usually occur, but when it does..), I just genuinely become scared and sometimes feel like crying, but I keep it in.",03Jul2020,1

11,How can I be happy today on my birthday if I haven’t had any friends tell me happy birthday and have no one to spend it with?,03Jul2020,1
12,"Backstory: my parents divorced when I was 5, and it was just me and my mom until I was 17. I was her support and she was mine, so we are really close (which I love, because we can talk about anything and everything in an open and honest manner). But after all those years of just being just the two of us, I sort of projected myself into the problem-solver role. I have a a great realationship with her partner, he has been in our lives for 11 years now, and he did stepped up to the plate a number of times. Also after the divorce, I developed a fear of losing my family again.

Now to the problem, even if they generally have a good relationship there are fights and stuff like that, which I know it's normal, but I always freak out. For example they had a squabble today and she called me to tell me about it, obviously she's being mad and being all like ""I'll show him"" , ""he is going to need x thing and I'm not gonna care"", "" I do this and that and he never does x"", and I know it's 99% just venting but my heart just sinks and I go into full damage control, then I keep creating these awful scenarios where they end up breaking up. 
I've talked to both of them togheter and separately and they both assured me that it would take more then some fights to break up. My mom also told me numerous times that usually after they fight and don't speak to one another for a while they end up laughing about it in the end, which was again confirmed by her partner. 
Still everytime this happens I go into panic/sad mood, and it takes me hours, or at least until she confirms that things are fine to get over it. Due to this is hard to enjoy my own life sometimes, or other times just being afarid being happy or doing stuff, because in the back of my mind there's always the though ""what if something bad happens?"".

18,"Title sums up pretty well, but every time someone shows me kindness it feels like they're trying to hurt me. I don't know how others perceive me so it feels like I'm secretly hated. Kind of like feeling like that One Kid from high school who has just zero sense of self and is so socially inept they're made into a laughingstock.Even in professional settings it feels like this. So whenever people are kind to me it almost seems like pity. Pity, being nice to me to fool me or just being maliciously manipulative by trying to lull me into a sense of false security. This paranoia is ruining my social life. 

For example, I was called over by my Japanese professor after class a few months back. She noted that I wasn't too into the practice activities and wanted to know why I wasn't as into it. When I told her it was because I already knew the material (I'm not wanting to puff myself up at all but I find the class very easy) and didn't see the point in fully participating bc of it, she offered to let me sit out the activities and peruse the textbook for self-study. I was shocked by this, I was expecting her to chide me and tell me any practice is important which would have been deserved, obviously. It felt like she was pitying me and singling me out. This led to me thinking she saw me as inept, needing of extra coddling etc. 

If I think logically about it, it's obvious she felt that if I didn't need the practice I should spend the time actually trying to learn but I can't help feeling this way. I hate being the 'special' one. Normally I can come off as a normal student without crippling social anxiety, I can socialize like anyone else when called for group work, I can sit down with a group and speak confidently. So I'm not some person in a hoodie in the corner refusing to interact with anybody. Why do I feel this way? I can only assume it's my insecurity in my own image.",03Jul2020,1
19,"I've been to many different types of mental health services ever since I was like 5. I ended up having to see multiple behavioral specialists my whole life over anger. I was diagnosed with ADHD and bipolar type 2 at 7 because I ended up doing physical harm to my cousin for being rude to me. I harmed a lot of people throughout my young years which is hard for me to accept today. It was reason for me to get checked for issues and also because I never spoke to my mother unless I absolutely has to. I was kinda silent a lot in my life which I still am today. Not the point though, I feel like I was diagnosed with bipolar without actually having bipolar so I could get medication shoved down my throat to make me a zombie rather than working through my thoughts and problems. I've been on many medications my whole and none have helped besides for adhd and anxiety.  Recently when I think about it, it seems like I was misdiagnosed and that's why the medication never did anything for me. I ended up going to therapy at like 14 up until my current period in life and I was diagnosed with PTSD and I feel like I had a lot of anger because I was rejected, shut down, forced to change how I felt, and was forced to be my mother's therapist from a young age and it didn't help I missed out on my childhood because my mother is disabled and has been since I was a kid a long with a lot of other traumatic shit from medical issues to sexual assault. I did go through depression but I've been out of it for a year. I don't really experience episodes like a person with bipolar. I just had legitimate depression for a few years because of the situation I was in rather than having bipolar type episodes. I don't take medication now so I know I'm not making it up otherwise I would be feeling differently. I just want to know if anyone else felt like they were misdiagnosed or forced on medication when really if you were talked to and listened to some things could've been prevented rather than it being a mental health disorder?",03Jul2020,1

22,"I feel like I spend most of my day in a dream. I'm always taking myself out of this world and putting myself in a new one. I've had these timelines for years that I made up that I sometimes go back to, but most of the time I just slightly adjust the current situation I'm in and make my own story. Like I could be sitting at my desk at work and say hi to a coworker. I'll then go into my dream where it's the exact same situation, except I have a whole new conversation. I even sometimes catch myself acting it out in real life, like actually speaking or making faces. But I'm obsessed with my worlds I make and I am almost always in them. Sometimes I make a choice to go but other times I don’t even realize I've left the real world til it's over. And even then my worlds are so real and repetitive I can't tell when something actually happened or it happened in my dreams. The worst part is there is usually an obsession over a person - not in a romantic or sexual way. Everyone in my life has been an obsession of mine at some point. Sometimes it lasts a few weeks, sometimes months. Then I switch to someone new, even if I've known them for years. I feel so out of control and disoriented. All I want to do is just lay in the dark and go to my worlds and stay there. 

Sometimes my dreams are of things that happened when I was younger, like the bad things. Like when I was taken advantage of when I was still a kid. I go back to specific moments of it. Like I don’t even remember his face or exactly how old. I just remember how I felt, how he felt on me and in me. How his right hand wrapped completely around my left thigh. How his hand was so hot it burned. It was like fire and like I was being shocked and I was paralyzed. I just remember the pressure. I only just started to remember these moments. And I keep going back. I think about this all the time. If I'm not there with him I'm in a new world with my current obsession. And those dreams usually end up with the person of my obsession just caring for me like family should, taking care of me, looking out for me. And when it doesn't happen in real life I feel so dark and isolated.

And the hardest part is like I know everyone is against me. Like I know they don’t like me, they're all in on it, they're faking and that's why. And they probably already know about my worlds and what happened. And I don’t get why they do that to me. They pretend to be nice and I fall for it every time but then I realize I can see past it. I know the truth right now but I'll forget by tomorrow when I see them and fall for it all again.

28,"In my 34 years on this planet, I have never been ready to deal with my mental health. I've experienced trauma, rejections, big life changes, and failures that have impaired my ability to function both as a child and now, as a responsible adult.

I am a husband and a proud father, and though I'm passionate and ambitious, I've never had the courage and motivation to follow through with those passions and ambitions. I suppose I'm afraid to fail, afraid to put myself out there. So afraid that as soon as I get ready to try something new, I talk myself out of it before I even begin. I'd rather choose failure than get my hopes up, just to face what I imagine to be the unavoidable failure. I'm struggling with depression and find it difficult to deal with day to day responsibilities, such as finding work, keeping a job, household chores, and other various responsibilities. When loved ones try to support and help me through these challenges and ""stuckness"", I feel confronted and guilty. I feel so bad that I become suicidal both in thought and verbally.

Recently, my loving and supporting wife has had it with all the insanity both at home and in the world. Due to quarantine and the current economic landscape, stress, and pressure buildup, she expressed that she really needed me to step it up by taking on more financial responsibilities. My anxiety kicked in, but I agreed to make an attempt to improve. Two weeks later, she expressed how hard the current climate is for her, and for whatever reason, I took it as her commentary on how disappointed she is with me and my behavior (probably because of my own low self-image and fears). My anxiety intensified, but I was afraid to communicate that to her because I felt sooo guilty. Sure enough, we had a second conversation that day, and I had a total meltdown. I became quite suicidal and totally lost my temperament and self-control in front of her and our children. Fortunately, we live close enough to my parents, that after wanting to end it all and having a million and one feelings and emotions run through my head, I mustered the courage to head over to them for support. This was helpful, as they talked me off the ledge, but my wife and I both realized that I really need help, and I cannot afford to kick this can down the road any further.

Our kids are getting older, and it's becoming apparent that my mental health is beginning to affect their mental health too.

Although the idea of opening up to a complete stranger scares me, I feel that I must deal with my demons now before my life completely passes me by, or worse yet, my mental health will harm myself or the ones I love.

I live in the NY Metro area, I thought fiding therapists would be easy. It's not. Also, I'm a Medicaid recipient, turns out I can't afford proper help... 

What do I do now? 

I don't want to give up! I want to get better!

31,"My older brother who is in his early 30s had a manic episode in 2015 where he crashed his car, caused a multiple car pile up, got arrested and resisted and got off because we realized he was mentally ill. He drove 3 hours north of his home with no destination and left his wallet and phone behind. He went to a medical center (mental health specific) for involuntary observation to get diagnosed and he never told us what the final diagnosis was and refused to take medicine. During this time he was violent towards his twin sister when she was trying to talk to him and nobody could get through to him. He was erratic and talking nonsense after we bailed him out of jail after the car crash. 5 years later he has not been the person he used to be, always in a daze and as if he doesn’t know what day of the week it is or anything. He doesn’t go see his son ever. I don’t even think he calls him. He doesn’t care about anything. He can’t work. He sits in a room all day blasting music and when he leaves the room he either goes and sits outside or he goes and walks or drives around for hours at a time. One time he got a motel room and was found just sitting in there. He did not pick up his phone and apparently he does this often. He usually shuts off the phone or blocks peoples numbers.

Based on our experiences with him and google resources we think he is either bipolar, or has DID or schizophrenic. The hospitals will not release any information. It is really hard on my parents because they feel as if there is nothing they can do. My mom doesn’t want to live like this where he’s smelly and dirty in the room and can’t work and she doesn’t want to have to take care of him forever. My dad wants to help so bad but whatever he does makes my brother mad and then he will ignore my dad.

I never met up with them but she did when I was in the hospital. One of the guys called me I was laughing and they were in there 20s and would freak when they found out I was 17. I was so young I didn’t understand why. My grandpa called the police they came and I was rude they tried to taser me because I refused to go with them one sat on me and I kicked him because I’m claustrophobic and my grandma told mental health I kicked him and they put me on 5150. They hand cuffed me and took me out of my house and I said to them my friends house is over there which it was just drop me off at her house and he wouldn’t. He took me to a crisis center the woman was mean and cold hearted I told her the walls were closing in on me can I step outside she was rude and said no. There’s plenty of space in here while I hyperventilated. Then they gave me a shot of haldol I told them I don’t want it they said it will calm you down. I just started sleeping on a couch they woke me up and told me they are sending me to a mental hospital 2 hours away I said I just wanna go home. I’m calm now they wouldn’t let me. When I got there they stripped searched me and took my pants away because they had strings and wouldn’t let me wear shoes even though they were slip on converse. I said give me my shoes. They told me we don’t wear shoes here I felt violated like I was raped then they gave me a bed there was a room mate. In the morning she woke up and said to me this place sucks I agreed with her then I went back to sleep and slept all day a lady asked me if I wanted dinner I expected good food. It was nasty so I took a couple bites and threw it in the trash. They got on my case for not eating it. Almost every meal was like that. I would take a bite or 2 and threw it away because it tasted gross. They wouldn’t let family bring you food. If they did I would have ate it. I was there 2 weeks they got mad because I wasn’t seeking treatment I just asked to go home every day I didn’t participate in groups because I didn’t want to be around people.

I’m doing summer classes at the community college right now because of the virus and I really thought I could handle taking three classes and keeping up with my schoolwork, but apparently that’s not going to happen. My problem is is that I have had depression since middle school and anxiety as well.

I want to ask my instructors for leniency because I feel I can accomplish the courses if I could be forgiven for late work, but I don’t want to explain to them my mental health.

doctor's appointments, ironically, have always been a huge source of anxiety for me.  i have never felt comfortable or looked forward to seeing any of my doctors.  the actual session is alright but for like two days leading up to it, i'm on edge and sometimes almost lose my appetite.  the worst part for me, usually, is planning how i'll get there and worrying about all the catastrophes waiting between my place and my doctor's place.  

in the past, i've left the house like two hours before my appointment simply because i *vastly* over-estimate my obstacles.  probably because there are none.  like, the bus might be five minutes late and in reality that's the worst that could happen.  i don't have to fight off a hoard or run through some corn maze, i just have to do something incredibly easy and normal.  i can't imagine how easy life would be if i could just forget my appointment was coming up and breeze through it all like it was no big deal.  because, it really isn't a big deal.",03Jul2020,1

He tried having sex with me and after trying 3-4 times under that situation until he stopped.

Directly after he said that we kissed once and he then tried having sex with me again, I said it still hurt and he stopped and he went to sleep. I couldn't sleep at all that night and went to pull the covers more over me like tow hours later and he started kissing me and fingering me and having sex with me.

54,"I'm 17 so I feel this isn't me just going overboard from hormones and such. But I'm incredibly impartial to some very serious things.

I don't wish to sound over dramatic, but I have problems with death or other people having emotional issues. I don't feel anything thinking about people dying, and I feel very little about a family member dying as well. I don't care about other peoples problems and what they go through.

I've never experienced taking a life or having a life taken in front of me but I feel as if I would be fine, like it just wouldn't effect me, and I'm fairly certain I'm correct. I don't get any feelings about seeing blood or even smelling it, I don't have problems seeing a corpse either.

I don't feel as if I'm this way because I lack the experiences of such things, I feel as if it just doesn't effect me at all. I've recently found something about psychosis and negative symptoms, and I thought it matched what I was feeling, but looking into it more I think it's wrong.

I'm able to feign the correct emotions for such events and scenarios, because I understand it's not normal to just be deadpanned to being told someone died, or a friend tried taking their life. I still have happiness in my life, it's a little hard finding something to give me happiness but I still have that emotion, sadness is very difficult to find and I find myself bored with everything instead. So I know I'm not completely void of emotional reactions, but I just don't feel anything towards matters where most people hold especially strong emotions.

Do I just have a lack of emotions for such things? Do I have a high tolerance for it? Or is something wrong with my brain that's causing me to not produce the correct emotions?

61,"About a month and a half ago I (22M) had a sudden panic attack out of the blue. I had no direct cause of anxiety or stress but i may have had some stress related issues pile up in the back of my head. After this panic i suffered from severe insomnia and i haven’t felt the same since. I feel on edge all the time sensitive to noises and bright lights. I have constant tingling in my extremities and head. I had waves of panic that came with paraesthesia. My legs feel sore and terribly stiff every day no matter how much I sleep or rest. My eyes feel tired no matter how much i sleep. Occasionally i wake up feeling my left side of my body tingling that slowly goes away. I have terrible fatigue and occasional migraines as well. 

I managed to survive about a month until i couldn’t take it anymore and met with my doctor.  I admitted that i went through intense hypochondria during this time because of my terrible physical symptoms thinking at first i was getting schizophrenia then switched to ALS and then to MS and to brain cancer. I explained to him my symptoms and he examined my blood ,B12, and thyroid. All came back clear and he gave me a GAD diagnosis. He prescribed me antidepressants and buspar for the next few weeks. 

That same day at night i woke up shivering terribly in bed at 4 AM and was so scared. The shivering passed after about 20 minutes. I convinced my parents to take me to the ER and the doctors examined me and determined i had nothing and gave me xanax and pain relievers. I was very frustrated by this outcome so the next day i went back to the ER and asked for a CT scan of my head. They were reluctant because they were convinced i had nothing but they gave me it. The scan came back clear and i was relieved for a bit, until my symptoms persisted. 

About 2 weeks into my antidepressant treatment and I’ve noticed some improvement. The burning paraesthesia with waves of anxiety have stopped and my insomnia has improved. However, i still feel so stiff and fatigued that it feels like i ran a marathon everyday. I fear that this is going to be permanent and chronic and this is my new life. Ive been reading about chronic stress and this seems to check most of its boxes. I have always been a anxious guy terribly so believe me but this is something completely different and lasts the entire day from beginning to end.

I started taking Venlafaxine (generic Effexor XR) about 5 days ago (I’m 18F if that matters btw). It worked really well for me, my anxiety and obsessive thoughts tampered down almost immediately (although they didn’t completely go away, and I do still feel quite blue from time to time). Only side effects I had was slight fatigue, decreased appetite and occasional yawning.

However, after reading other people’s experiences with this drug and the extreme withdrawal symptoms, I’ve decided to stop taking it and switch to Zoloft. The only issue I have now is deciding wether to quit cold turkey or taper. I would rather not get withdrawal symptoms, but I also really don’t want to continue taking this drug. I’ve talked to my doctor about quitting and she said that I could quite immediately and take Zoloft, but I’m still kinda worried. What are y’all thoughts on how I can safely?

therapist I’ve been seeing every week for the past 7 months. It’s been very hard for me to open up about my past, abuse, and trauma. I found myself just getting comfortable with my therapist.

I know my therapist is just a person and that this is just their job. I know people leave jobs all the time. I’m told I would be contacted by a new therapist within the week, however I feel like I no longer want to continue therapy. I just got my official diagnosis of PTSD and Bipolar 2 and we were just talking medication. I know my new therapist will have all my notes but I feel like I’m completely starting over.

69,"I've been having suicidal urges for the better part of the past five years. Always a different plan depending on where I spent most of my time. Here are some of my plans that I just never executed;

* When I was taking Isotretinoin, I was prescribed a really high dose so I had tons of it with me. I regularly thought of taking an entire box of the 40mg caps - I was hoping it would either kill me outright or cause enough liver damage to kill me that way. (thought out for about six months)
* When I was on a school trip, it was to jump straight off a museum's roof in a foreign country and hit the pavement below headfirst. (spontaneous thought)
* When I was in high school, there was a very known coffee shop across the road (70kmh limit). My plan was to pretend to be mobile ordering on my phone and cross on the red. Hopefully getting hit and instantly killed by the impact. (thought out for about a year)
* Last year it was to jump into an 80kmh road. (spontaneous thought)
* When I found out I was failing two classes at uni, I was going up to my rez roof to jump off into the road below. However, because my uni was well known for how many people kill themselves in rez (one a month minimum), the roof was not accessible. (spontaneous thought)
* Current plan is to travel to Japan and go back to the one happy place that I can remember having in my life, a wagyu beef place in Kyoto. After having the best beef ever, I'd probably use the rest of whatever money I have left from my credit cards to buy some time with some hookers and a bunch of drugs. Then, find an easy way to off myself in a remote area where hopefully no one will ever find me. I'll be declared dead in absentia and my insurance would pay out. (plan for the past 6 or so months)

I don't understand what is stopping me, I just never go through with it.

My ""friend"" group is playing CS:GO as I write this. I was initially in the call first and in the lobby, but another friend joined and they pushed me out to accommodate the five-person limit of a game. They just stopped responding to me talking in the discord. 

My stomach pain is getting worse and worse I have a hard time sleeping because of how much it hurts.

I always have a lingering feeling of sadness, sometimes it's relatively tame but most of the time (like all of the past 2 weeks) it's pretty bad. I just do not know when it's going to stop doing that. I've been hopeful but now am less and less hopeful since it started 7 years ago.

A few months ago he basically had a hiccup that made him feel embarrassed. He contacted his ex and leaned too much into it. He felt extremely embarrassed when word got out to his close friends what he had done. Because of this he is convinced he is a failure. He also was looking forward to being more involved in the community that he felt embarrassed in. He says his life is ruined. He isolates himself from my family. He will ignore questions (we all want to be there for him and offer help). If he even answers, there no depth. I’ve tried to get him out of the house for a little. One day he left and didn’t tell anyone where he was or what he was doing (very unlike him) and we were all terrified. He will not consider counseling. Even online counseling he shuts down.

I’ve talked with him for hours about how his mistakes don’t define him and his feelings are valid. And he’ll be okay that day, but the next it just goes back to the way it was. I’m also not currently living there so I can’t check up on him everyday. I just feel stuck. Everyone feels stuck. I’m terrified of when he’ll actually make a horrible mistake that he won’t know how to process everything or forgive himself. He thinks a time machine is the only thing that will fix it. I’m even debating on putting this on here but I figured, well why not. Please share your thoughts or resources that may help.",03Jul2020,1
71,"Today I had to take my cat to the vet and they told me she's anemic and going to die soon and there's nothing I could do to prevent it. They tried to convince me to put her down on the spot, but I was a crying mess and couldn't so they told me to force feed her for the weekend then call them back. Tomorrow I'm going to go to another vet because I thought that vet was incompetent, but that's not the point of this story.  


While I was waiting a half hour for them to do bloodwork sitting outside of the vet office, crying uncontrollably into the mask they made me wear a crazy person started coming down the street. A large tattoo-covered man with no shirt just shorts and flip flops. He started talking loudly to the other people standing outside the vet office with their animals about how the night before on that street someone beat him up and now he's looking for a cop to tell them.   


Eventually the guy stopped talking to them and continued down the road. I was sitting a little further away from everyone against a street fixture.  I'm a weird hermit who doesn't know what the fuck your social distancing mask whatever covid nonsense rules are, got berrated for that by the receptionist and the doctor so I opted to sit down the street. The guy passed me without saying anything. A couple minutes later he I see him out of the corner of my eye standing next to me and he hands me a stack of fliers for a laptop repair shop and says ""here take this!""   


I take it and start to read it to figure out what the fuck the guy just handed me, squeeze out a ""thanks"" through my tears. A little bit later he pulls 3 blowpops out of his pocket, 2 were cherry and one was a sour apple I think. He asked me if I wanted one, I didn't, but I wasn't going to turn down his kindness so I took one of the cherry's because he had two of that kind and I figure leave him with one of each. He immediately said ""NO DON'T TAKE THAT ONE TAKE THIS ONE"" and handed me the other cherry one.   


Then he continued down the street. 

&amp;#x200B;

Later one of the other people hanging outside the vets office that the crazy guy told he got beat up saw a security guard walking down the street and shouted ""ARE YOU A REAL COP OR JUST SECURITY?"" guy is clearly wearing a security uniform and he has a rat-tail and goatee which I don't think most precincts would be cool with. 

""I'm security but there's a cop right there."" he points across the street. The two men start  walking down the street together with the man who was standing outside the vet now recounting the crazy man's story to the security guard. The doctor then came out to tell me my cat is dying and I can't do anything about it, so I didn't see what happened from there.",03Jul2020,1

76,"I was diagnosed with Asperger's when I was very young, I've always struggled in school and continue to do so in college. Looking at my low GPA reminds me of my drawbacks, and makes me wish I could just be one of those smart kids who somehow get 4.0's, I'm on par with the lazy unenthused students who just kind of meander through college and somehow pass, and it really puts a lot of weight on me while I try to study diligently and practice good note-taking skills. I'm always a step behind, at least it feels like it. It'd be nice if I were just lazy, and all I needed to do is just /try/ and all my problems would feel less opressing.

 That brings me to my next point, I feel like I look lazy, in fact I'm called lazy by my stepfather when I feel too overwhelmed to do anything but shut myself in my room. Going out for a drive anywhere is anxiety-inducing, I'm looking for work but until then I just practice my art in private, to which im told isnt real work and that I ""literally dont do anything"" but game and draw. I'm trying to build a portfolio but im still young and far behind on my technical skill. I don't have any good art schools nearby and am in no position to take out heafty loans anyway. 

Getting back on the topic, I'm just so tired of the constant feeling of being overwhelmed, im sick of finding reasons to cry almost every other night, im tired of the self harm I inflict on myself as ""punishment for being slow"" that feels justifiable in the moment. Videogames don't bring me joy or escapeism like they used to, my problems still exist there. Art is my most positive outlet, but man is it hard sometimes. I'm just hoping for better days to come and to feel less reasons to look at my life like I'm failing.

TLDR: Asperger's has pulled me down mentally since I was a child, and I feel dumber and less confident than everyone around me, and I just want my outlook on life to change.",03Jul2020,1
77,"I've been struggling for a long time. But lately, I just don't have the energy for anything anymore. Interacting with people is exhausting. Going outside is exhausting. Playing games or doing pretty much anything I used to enjoy is exhausting. Watching things is exhausting. Fuck, half the time, just existing is exhausting.

I have to keep myself constantly distracted though, or things get weird in some pretty horrible ways. So I spend most my life playing stupid, mindless mobile games that I actually kind of hate, or staring at some random show that's on for background noise and doesn't really hold any interest for me. I genuinely don't find any enjoyment anything anymore, so it just feels pointless to spend the energy doing things.

I've been in some pretty dark places, but I really think that this is getting close to the very end of what a person can handle. I don't even have any motivation to end it, nor could I do that to the people in my life. I just kind of lay around, hoping it's going to be over soon.",03Jul2020,1

I’m struggling to keep up with school, I worked at very high stress mental health hospital, and felt so unbelievably alone. No friends, no mentor. Some days I thought I was ok, other days My depression would sneak up on me like a predator chasing its prey. The crying spells, the hopelessness would not end. Today I made the leap. Today I realized I want to change. I want to feel something. I no longer wish to mope around in self pity. I made an appointment to get help, and god it feels so good.",03Jul2020,1
81,"I'm a 21F and I'm moving soon. I'm excited to be starting over without my parents, but I'm also nervous too. See, growing up I had a hard time with friendships. I had a best friend in 6th grade who was awful to me. Would put me down and tell people my business without my permission and would play victim when I got mad. This was pretty much how our friendship ended. We had a bad falling out it was an awful fight that almost got physical, it really impacted me. No joke I cried for a week

•7th grade, I made friends with a group of boys and I started dating one of the boys. One of my friends in the group started tormenting me. I moved to a different school and made friends with two other girls. I was the third wheel and I fell out with them when one of the girls let the other girl text me nasty things from her phone. Me and the other girl who texted me got in a fight because she accused me of telling a classmate about her crush (even though she was right next to me when it happened)

•8th grade, one of my friends moved, and another started hanging out with a group of girls who didn't like me. These girls hit my little sister with glass one summer, which led to me almost getting jumped lol. Anyways, my friend fb messaged me to be nasty and say she never liked me and she felt sorry for me and such. I cursed her out and I feel terrible now because she passed away last year. 

•9th grade I was friends with two girls, but they slowly started pushing me away and became closer with each other. I don't have ill feelings for them, but it still hurt 14 year old me. I also had a friend who gave me the silent treatment out of nowhere and I still don't know why.

•10th grade and so on I had friends, but I never got too close to anyone. 

•This is just the tip of the iceberg, I had a friend in 4th grade who was jealous of me and told my best friend who she was also friends with to not talk to me. My best friend also told me I was the ""annoying"" one in our class and in 5th grade my friend used to clown me around boys and said always made fun of me not having boobs (ironic since they're big now lol). 

Even my casual friends now that I made in high school, I'm scared to get close to them. The thought of getting close to anyone now freaks me out and it makes it hard for me to make friends. I always assume people will find me annoying or not want to hang out with me anymore, so that's why I don't want to become friends with anyone because I have this irrational fear they'll turn their back on me later. Which sucks because I so desperately want that best friend feeling again. That feeling of being able to call someone whenever I'm happy, sad, angry, heartbroken, etc. But I don't want to let my guard down and get hurt again. I'm not saying I'm perfect because I'm definitely not, but I never did anything like this to a friend of mine. It sounds silly because I'm a grown up now and I don't want to be holding on to my childhood like that. And when I move, I want to make friends, but I honestly don't know how. I never realized how awkward I was until my coworker asked why I was so shy and reserved. I'm sorry if it's long, but can anyone give me some advice?",03Jul2020,1
82,"I was in a relationship for about a year with a girl with (what she told me) depression, anxiety, social anxiety.

I honestly don’t know if I was and it’s fucking my mind because there’s no definitive way for me to know. When we started dating, she did this thing called “silent treatment” as kind of a joke, and so I followed along and it just turned petty and it was toxic. She would call herself ugly, I’d disagree and tell her she wasn’t, and she’d never “believe” me. I understand that some people have insecurities but her body language showed to me that she wasn’t insecure, as I’m insecure myself but I’m not her so I can’t for sure know. She broke up with me on ft and I begged her to come back, and then over the next three days I kept asking why and she wouldn’t give me a single reason besides that I always “assumed” things, which is hypocritical of her to say if you knew her. I helped repair almost all of her friends issues, (looking back, I was put in position where I could’ve isolated her easily when she was dead bent on not being friends with her two closest did not like me), and I helped her get through that and through her mental and emotional problems. She would cry sometimes on ft without reason (that I knew of).

i’m currently in my first year. recently due to the pandemic, sch’s are closed, so I have HBL ( Home based learning ) in term one and term two ( 17 weeks i think for both ). 

so term one just ended and it was all zoom classes. as someone who has social anxiety ( though not diagnosed clinically ), i tried my best to be open, talk, and even make jokes in class, and I don’t think I was that one kid that was trying too hard. 

I just wanted to feel accepted and I just wanted to have friends that I can call my friends because most of them are not. People have already formed cliques on their own ( in zoom we had breakout sessions so it’s random, if you are in a room filled of ppl you vibe with then good for you, clique formed). however that’s not the case for me, i have the shittiest of lucks to be paired up w some of the people that already have cliques, or some whom do not share my humour. though in term one I thought i had friends that I can relate to and can talk to, it was different today.

Today was the first day of on campus lessons ( lab lessons ) and i was with my friend that was from the same sec sch, so we r quite close. we both have the same issues. we even joined an outing with some of our classmates but we feel like we tried to talk to them, tried to socialise but ... apparently it was a waste of time?... 

In class we have assigned seats, and i was paired up w a guy that already has a clique??? i’m not sure but i just feel that... he has something against me..? i don’t know, i just feel like whenever i interact w someone i feel that they already judged me pretty badly, thinking i’m weird etc...

I really don’t know how to feel better after seeing cliques posting their group selfies and then having a fun time, any tips?.. should i even ask tjem out even if they have their own cliques ??? i just feel so ostracised it’s crazy how this is affecting me so badly..",03Jul2020,1

There were nights I would act manic and just ruminate on stressful thoughts. I just couldn't seem to find a therapist who I trusted or thought was listening to me. My general practitioner wasn't even much help (in his defense he knew I needed better help).   


On March 13th, after weeks of feeling suicidal and having a plan I called a hotline who convinced me to go to the ER. I did. I was hospitalized for a week.   


I'm grateful I went to the ER that day. I felt like I saved my life.   


After the ER, I was in an IOP for 3 months. I graduated from it 2 weeks ago.   


This all happened to me during COVID. Nothing about my treatment has been routine. I sat at home alone while being told a depressed person shouldn't isolate themselves. I did an entire IOP over zoom. I didn't have any other choice. It's not my fault this has happened to me during a global pandemic.   


To top it off, I lost my job 2 weeks ago (the morning after I finished the IOP).   


I'm now trying to find an outpatient therapist. I've talked with two so far who after I explain the last 6 months of my life tell me that I need a therapist whose more available or could give me more individual attention.   


What does that even mean?   


I appreciate their honesty but I'm starting to get fed up. I can't keep retelling my story for the last 6 months and be told they can't help me. It's making me distrustful of therapists.   


Also, am I that screwed up in the head that nobody thinks I'm worth helping? I'm just that damaged ...

He can even get violent sometimes, when we asked him about it he says he doesn't remember why he did it or give us some non nonsensical excuse. It's get worse when he has any hard alcohol he goes insane, a month ago he pulled a gun on my mom and threatened to shoot her head off, my mom took the gun from him and handed it to my dad and then he whined to her asking why she took the gun. The doctors have said that he can't live by himself anymore, and he can't live with us. the problems with this is he has no one else who cares for him other than us, my mom who takes care of him has extreme heart problems and can't handle stress, she can barley walk sometimes she has some sort of implant for her back that vibrates to num the pain that is not working, along with other problems. The last problem he does not want to live in a retirement center, so we are afraid he will go into a rage and get kicked and even if he we get him to say okay to this he will just forget about it in a day and go into a rage. at the moment he lives in a retirement trailer park so if we send him off to a retirement center and he gets kicked out, We wont be able to send him back to the trailer park. I don't think my mom would be able to handle that stress. Don't get me wrong we love him dearly and he used to not be like this, we only put up with this because we care about him, so we don't want him to be treated badly but we can't deal with him anymore.

95,"My parents both have mental illnesses. My mom has anxiety and my dad has several more specific disorders. Probably because of this, my mom has always presented herself to us as someone who takes mental health seriously. She has always encouraged us to tell her if we are struggling with mental health, and she will be there for us and help us get help. 

Last year, at the age of 18, I started to develop pretty severe anxiety symptoms. I’ve always been a high-strung person, so when I was diagnosed with moderate-to-severe GAD, it was a surprise to absolutely no one. My mom, true to her word, was pretty supportive. She encouraged me to find a good therapist and to get on meds. She didn’t judge me for it. She took my anxiety seriously. 

Today I found out that my 16-year-old sister was diagnosed with depression around the same time as my anxiety diagnosis. I was very surprised to learn this. My family is usually pretty open about mental health stuff, so I wondered how this had never come up until now. And I know this is a common theme with depression, but like... you’d never guess. She seems like one of the happiest individuals on the planet. She’s funny and sweet and has tons of friends. Anyway, she said the reason it’s never come up is because my mom hasn’t responded to it in the same way that she’s responded to my anxiety. My sister isn’t getting any sort of treatment right now, and my mom just doesn’t really think it’s a big deal.

Clearly, my mom has some sort of double standard. Maybe she takes me more seriously because my issues are more obvious (I behave like a stereotypical anxious person, my sister hides her emotions well). Maybe it’s because my mom can relate better to my disorder because of her own experiences with anxiety. Maybe it’s because depression is more common and “it seems like everyone has it these days”. 

Whatever the reason though, I’m angry, and I’m worried for my sister. I am an adult; my sister is not. My mom has an obligation to help my sister, and no such obligation to help me, yet her actions would make it seem as though it’s the other way around. Right now my sister has no issues with self-harm, substance abuse, or anything else like that, and I don’t want it to have to come to that for my mom to realize this is real. And I’m just so shaken to find out that my mom isn’t really who I thought she was.",03Jul2020,1

I'm really upset and need someone to talk to or help me out. I'm 22 and after 12 years of mental health issues I finally decided to get some help and I finally found a Psychiatrist that takes my insurance and was accepting new patients during COVID. I've been diagnosed with ADD, severe anxiety, and bipolar Disorder, and JUST started taking medication.

When I went to get my prescription filled I found out my psych didn't send authorization to my insurance company and I had to pay $60 or wait a week and hope he calls them and explains the medical necessity for it. Apparently he has to do it every month I want to have prescriptions filled. I emailed him about it, I paid the $60 (that I really didn't have) and thought it was going to be fine. He just sent me an email saying: 

""I have been practicing for many years, with many insurance companies, and have never had a situation where there is a requirement to seek specific authorization each month for the medication.  This is a time-consuming process (it often takes 1-2 hours) and if your insurance, in your case, requires this on my part, I am afraid that I will not be able to do this and continue to treat you.""

97,"I have never posted anything about my mental health online. Never spoken to anyone that wasn't a professional or a sibling or partner. I'm 26, just bought a house of my own, in a stable relationship and have had been in remission (if that's the right word) from my BPD/ depression/ anxiety for 3 years. 

You know what caused this panic attack that brought me to the brink of passing out???? An email from my boss asking if I could come in a little early on Monday so we could chat about a few things? Instantly I got anxious and sent her a text asking if she could tell me what it was about because otherwise I'd freak out. She casually responded with not to freak out or anything it's just a chat. I then pushed it more and she basically got annoyed with me pushing so I apologized. I think I know what it's about and it seriously isn't that big of a deal (had a conversation with a co worker that probably wasn't workplace appropriate and was on my phone a bit too much) which in Australia or my workplace is not a fireable offence and I won't even get a formal warning. Just a heads up saying I should probably present myself better. No biggy right? 

Wrong.

I could feel it building. Everything just exploded. The tears and the emotions that feel like it's so tight in your skull that your anxiety driven brain feels like it's literally about to burst out your ear drums and spray onto the walls. I was home alone and knew I had to stop but I couldn't. I sent 8 messages in succession to my partner but due to his recent promotion he can't be on his phone. I resorted to calling my mother who is the main cause of my BPD and not someone who I see as a caring or sympathetic soul. I just knew she would answer and keep talking until I felt my hands and feet again.

I don't know why I'm even writing on here. I've made like 3 Reddit posts in the past. I just feel like I'm carrying these secrets with me. All this #metoo stuff I keep seeing on twitter is making a flood of bad emotions slowly rise. I was raped by my ex and I had dealt with that until a close friend and his buddy drugged my drink and took me home with them... Just after I had started dating the man of my dreams. I never fully dealt with it. I pretended it didn't happen at first and even fucking tried to force myself to still be friends with him. I told my partner, well, it all exploded out when I experienced the same  not-in-control feeling I had that night while doing weed for the first time. I couldn't handle it and the second my boyfriend touched me I screamed it all out. After that I blocked the ""friend"" and all our mutuals so he wouldn't appear in my newsfeed, stopped going to the places he worked and prayed I'd never encounter him again (have seen him once in a shopping centre and when he walked passed I almost vomited) 

I think about the assault once a week, maybe if I'm lucky once every two weeks. Nothing overpowering just a little niggle in the back of my head. 

All this stuff I've seen lately has made it fester inside me like a disease. It spread inside me like a fucking cancer until...

Until my boss asked me to have a chat and I have a panic attack. Why? Because im scared I'll get in trouble? Yes that probably accounts for 10 drops of emotion that just made my bucket of anxiety spill out onto my loungeroom floor. Every little drop of emotion when looked at as it's dripping seems like nothing. Until you collect it all in a bucket without letting anyone help you empty it or even see how much is in there. Then, before you know it. All these little drips you have been keeping to yourself almost drowns you in your own living room.

Moving on to my mom,
I feel comfortable talking to her, I do share a lot of things with her, but somehow whenever I get into an argument with dad or sis, she's never on my side and reveals all the things I've said to her. In recent times, because of the way she has reacted to certain things I've said, I feel that she's changed. She no longer wants to listen to my stuff.
My sister, younger than me, I kinda always feel scared to talk to her, she's a little bit rude but i think its the workload that makes her so.
And then my own situation, unemployed but appearing certain exams to rectify the situation (99% will be employed in the next month or so)
I feel extremely embarrassed and ashamed of my employment situation
I want to say a lot more things but I dont know where to begin with them.

107,"Hi,

I (21F) am a longtime reddit lurker and have finally made an account because I don’t know how to go on.
I’ve had issues with my mental health for as long as I can remember, but it got considerably worse when I was about 13.I started self harming,was dealing with an eating disorder and plunged into a deep depression that I don’t think I’ve come out of.I can’t point out one year,or even a moment where I might’ve done better since then.I was able to endure it for a long time but I finally feel like I have no way to go on and that scares me.
I’ve ghosted all of my friends and almost all of my family.I don’t know why,I don’t want to isolate myself to this point but I can’t control it.
I’ve recently come back from a year abroad and am now living with my mother and her boyfriend whom I’ve never met before.I lost both of my jobs and had to cut my trip short because of COVID.Going back home,especially moving back in with my mother,was devastating.I felt like I had made a lot of progress and had started to built a life for myself away from everything.
My relationship with my parents is very strained because of the way they treated me when I was younger up until now.I won’t go into detail,but I’ll say that I was never physically abused.I love them,but they are not understanding at all and don’t offer me support.
At 18,I was living on my own in our family home because everyone else moved out (long story) and finally talked to my parents about my issues.I was told to see my PCP about it,who then gave me a referral to a psychologist.All that was needed to do was to make a phone call and get an appointment.Because that day was very exhausting for me and I have problems with phone calls,I asked my mom to please make the appointment.When I asked about it later,she said that they only had appointments a few months down the road and that I would have to talk to my dad about it anyway because he would have to drive me there(at this point my parents were separated).I didn’t think much of it then,or maybe I just didn’t want to, but it turned out she never made the appointment.And my dad (whom I talked to first and who was the one who suggested seeing my PCP) never even asked what came of it.That was such a punch in the gut,you won’t believe it.Since then I’ve never dared to ask for help or support,never even brought up anything remotely close to my mental health ever again.

I feel like I’m at my breaking point now.I’m dependent on my parents again,I need their help but I’m so scared of trusting them.I could go out and just do it all by myself but unfortunately I don’t think I’m well enough to do that. I wouldn’t say I’m suicidal,I don’t want to kill myself but I’m getting more and more intrusive thoughts and I don’t see a way out.I need to get better but I’m scared of asking for help.If anyone else has been through something similar and can offer advice please do,I’m very desperate.

110,"I've been through 8 different psychologists/psychiatrists (shortened to ""psychs"" here). I moved on whenever I was sure they were a ""bad match"". The primary issues were laziness/apathy/empty promises, condescending attitudes, specialization mismatch, sadistic dehumanization (of me), and extreme forgetfulness (every session was fucking Groundhog Day).

I've honestly tolerated each one to the best of my ability. The flaws in their approach and demeanor eventually grate on me, and I grow to resent them.  
IDK, could this be a personal problem?  All I want's for someone to be somewhat familiar with me &amp; my struggles, be there for me to talk to about taboo shit, and maybe give me some advice about specific symptoms. So... general competency and openness!

Now, obviously I'm not ever expecting to find a psych straight out of a film. Almost certain that my expectations are not the issue here.  
But maybe all of my ideas revolving around therapy itself are skewed. Am I not supposed to like them, nor the process itself?

Admittedly, some of this discordance is likely my fault, as I have never expressed my frustrations to any of them. I just assumed that they have their own scripts to follow and would figure out how to best deal with me.  
Making direct demands or even suggestions seems taboo. Is there a way to recognize a psych's approach? Such as, what exactly they might aim to do (if anything lol). It'd help immensely if I felt something was happening. Well, assuming that psychs who do ""talk therapy"" mostly follow something that's formulaic at its core.

It’s the only thing that makes me feel ok and quiets the voices in my head that tell me I’m worthless and useless and a loser. When I get drunk, that voice goes away, and then another voice comes into my head which is confident, cocky even. But I don’t act cocky. It just is a nice reprieve from the chaos of every day life in my mind. When I’m sober, I’m constantly battling the voices in my head. I have full blown arguments with myself on a regular basis. I find that time slips away from me and I can’t focus. I’ve taken antidepressants, and they haven’t had much of an effect until lately, but I stopped taking those during COVID for no particular reason. There is more to say about that, but I don’t want to bore people. I’ve seen therapists, none of whom I felt provided a sense of understanding or insight that helped me. It felt like they had canned responses to whatever issue I brought up. If I tried to explain further, it felt like they saw that as me rationalizing my own behavior, but all I was trying to do was to lay everything on the table so they would understand better and be better equipped to help me. I’m drunk now. I don’t have work tomorrow. I like how I feel now. I don’t like how I feel most of the time. I have, in the past, gone a year without drinking. I went to rehab at 20, and didn’t drink for a year after. I have never abused drugs. I’ve smoked weed about 10 times in my entire life, and never liked it, and I’ve done nothing else except drink and smoke cigarettes. This is not the life path I want to be on, but I don’t see an off ramp. Does anyone relate to this? Do you have any insight or advice? Obviously there is a lot more I could say, like how I felt completely demoralized by my college experience, and how I used to blame my parents for it, but now realize I share much of the blame (without negating the environmental role they played).

I am fortunate enough to have moved out from home however - I currently am at university. But because of many factors (inc. social anxiety and by university being really terrible at running social events; I tried my best for the 2 years Ive been here and nothing I joined ran even before covid) I havent been able to meet any friends here. I have a friend group from school, but ofc can only talk to them online... and theyre lovely lovely people but theyre very introverted and all have good families, so no matter what I feel like Im chasing them for any kind of social thing as they dont tend to initiate, and often when I do they'll forget to come and Im left on my own.

I feel really bad because I feel like Im putting more on them than their anxious selves can feel comfy with, but at the same time... Im really envious of them being home with good families whilst Im profoundly isolated, and am kinda angry inside because I feel kinda neglected, and I keep telling myself ""oh theyre home with their families, they dont need you, leave them alone theyre perfectly happy""  
Idk this has just been a big ramble but can anyone relate? It's hell being alone with nothing but the pain of my own thoughts from my upbringing, but I also dunno if Im being a bit entitled in expecting too much from my group? Idk haha

118,"Hi there,

This is something I've been struggling with all my life but it's finally starting to piss me off.   
I get SO OBSESSED with things. Hyper fixations I guess, but this week has been the tipping point.

I got really into a book, invested in it, and couldn't put it down - but not like when people say ""wow can't put this book down x"" I mean I felt trapped.

I couldn't eat, sleep, wash, work, talk to people, anything. Whenever my family or partner tried talking to me I just wished they would go away and felt unreasonably irritated (and I'm an extrovert, so it's not just me being isolating.) 

I felt so trapped in this book and obsessed to continue it. I finished it today (2 days after I started, a 700 page book) and am now feeling dissociated like I'm watching my real life as if it's a tv show.

I have diagnosed BPD, anxiety, depression, and OCD. I thought maybe this level of obsession completely trapping my mind went under OCD because of the obsession but it feels different. I don't think I need to do it or ""something bad will happen"", I just literally can't help it, my brain in't under my own control. 

Could anyone offer me advice? 

Thanks,

A few years ago, I was able to go abroad with for a school field trip to Sri Lanka. I will never forget the moment I saw their stunning botanical gardens. I just wanted to sit there and weep because of the sensations that began to consume me and how beautiful it was against the golden sunset.

The truth is I don't know my value anymore. I just genuinely want to be happy in life, I just want to go out for once and be able to feel I don't have a worry in the world. I just want to be able to tell someone I like them, to hold someone's hand and feel its warmth, or walk about unafraid without thinking of all the fire hazards around me. I just want to be myself and be proud of the person I am. I just want to step out and not feel insecure about every joint in my body. I just want to feel at peace and WHOLE for once in my life.",03Jul2020,1

131,"Throughout the years, I (31/F) have been losing friendships because either: they’re shady, don’t give a fuck, fake, etc. All of my social media accounts have been deactivated as of lately, well except for Reddit (although I don’t count this as one). I am currently in nursing school, focusing on classes online. Kinda sucks dealing with it because of the pandemic, not having interaction meeting new schoolmates. This pandemic has been feeling down and my sanity just goes up, down, and around like a damn roller coaster. I’m currently staying with my boyfriend. He’s doing his best to understand my depression and help. The past few months, I feel like I’ve been attacked by classmates and couple other people whom I thought were “friends,” for NO REASON AT ALL. Nightmares don’t help either.

Just want to make new friends with women around my age, who can relate with mental health and empowering/motivating one another. I need a mental reset.",03Jul2020,1
132,"My mom was talking about how I should try to avoid dark videos since it can lead to mental health issues or suicidal thoughts. I wanted to scream because she told me this too late and I'm already long past that threshold. I also cried in my room blaming myself for slipping up a little on the facade that I was okay the other night. 
It's not like I've been metaphorically sucker punched for opening up about issues before, but for as long as I remember I've just kept everything negative I thought inside, the few times I told someone how I felt can be counted on one finger and all except for one incident have been with friends online under anonymity. 
So yeah, vulnerability scares me. I want to yell about all my feelings to someone because I know one day this will all blow up in my face but nothing comes out of my mouth. I don't want to be more of a burden to anyone than I already am, I don't want anyone to deal with my problems because this is my mess that I myself made and no one should have to deal with that. My dad thanks me for growing up healthy and strong, and I always feel guilty about it because I'm not strong at all.
It's messed up, but sometimes I wished they didn't care so much about me, because they'll be better of not having had me at all. I don't know if I really mean it, but I think about how many people pray for parents who care, and if I could trade places with any of them I would because they deserve it. 
On one hand, I want to talk about this to someone, maybe a counsellor or my parents, and I want to know how I can do that. On the other hand, the thought of opening up to someone literally makes me cry. I don't understand myself at all.",03Jul2020,1
133,"I'm writing this post to express how I felt today. This sort of stuff should go into a journal, but I'm writing it here, because if someone who feels as hopeless as I do can see some positivity, you too will see it someday. Having said that, if this sort of post is not welcome here, I can understand.

I've had depression and anxiety that was left untreated for a very long time. I only started taking medication for it a week ago. It is bad. There is so much self-loathing and I hate talking to my fucking mind. Motherfucker won't shut up about the negativity of everything and my brain just decides to listen to it. I know they're the same thing, but you can imagine what I'm saying.

I only started taking medication because my doctor said the earliest appointment I could get with a psychologist is a month away. 

I also have mild insomnia which in turns leads to exacerbated anxiety and depression. Going through the night without any sleep is torture because I'm not rested and I also have to spend 6-8 hours of listening to my mind spew bullshit again.

Today, something different happened. I never really had a ear for music, despite having learned to play some instruments. I don't listen to music at the gym, when running, or even when I'm on a long bus journey. I just couldn't get into it.

For some reason, I decided to check out what Donald Glover has been creating because I loved his work as a comedian. The song that I picked was Redbone. 

Something happened. 6.30AM in the morning, the sun is not completely out yet, and I'm sipping some tea with my feet stretched out on the window enjoying the cold morning breeze while listening to this song. There is no background noise. No vehicles, no people moving about. Just me in this world, with this song. I just stared at a street sign, while listening to this song and I remembered how happiness felt again for the shortest flash of time. 

I remembered what it felt like to not be a depressed fuck. Into the emptiness of the street in front of me, I flashed an involuntary and genuine smile in reaction to the song and the conditions. I haven't had a genuine positive reaction in a very long time. 

And that is the new moment I am going to hold on to. If I can feel this way for a second, maybe not all is lost. I want to chase this feeling, and I want to make it last because now I remember how it feels. 

I know this can come across to some of you as ""Go take a walk in the woods, or go for a run! It'll cure your depression!"". I promise you, it's not about that. It's about paying attention to the tiniest glimmer of positivity in your life, even if it is a loose end of a thread, because today I feel like it is worth hanging on to that thread.

134,"I graduated with a film degree from a not so great school 2 years ago. I thought filmmaking was what I wanted to do, but it’s just been so hard for extreme reasons out of my control. 

I don’t have ANY friends, any job, and due to the pandemic I’m at home living with my parents. I’ve also been diagnosed with BPD so that’s made sense why everything has been harder for me. 

The film industry is hard to break into unless you form good connections in college, or have family working in it. My college connections are non existent due to unique reasons.

I’m Insanely depressed and don’t know how to turn my life around. I feel like I don’t even know what type of job (besides retail + barista/service) I can get with my degree and not having any other skill/not knowing what to do next. I don’t think I can put myself through another course due to money and not having an interest strong enough to do it. Also fear that I will waste money and time on another course, while I age, to only end up unemployed and overlooked once more. 

When I was younger I used to feel like I was destined for greatness in a creative field, but I don’t feel like that at all anymore. I do believe I have talent, but that’s irrelevant in an industry where others need to see the potential in you. Where do I go from here? I’m so scared and depressed.

135,"i would not be making this post unless i genuinely had nowhere else to go with this. i don’t have a therapist because i cant afford one, my experiences with suicide hotlines have been terrible and usually result in me feeling worse, i have no friends, my family is emotionally abusive (not based on this issue alone, but based on other behaviour). that's why i'm on reddit right now.

I have lists and lists of mental health problems, have had severe debilitating depression since i was 13, have had other issues since i can remember. i'm 22 now. one problem that i've struggled with, apparently since infancy according to my mother, is insomnia. i either don't sleep at all or sleep completely nocturnally. as i hit puberty the symptoms of it got worse and i became essentially permanently nocturnal. 

at this time i lived with my mother and she didn't bother me about it but she got sick a few years ago and i had to move in with my father who was extremely unaccepting of it. he seems to think i don't actually have insomnia and that i'm merely lazy and that all i need is to be forced to wake up early every day and thus my insomnia and nocturnal circadian rhythm will right itself. 

he thinks my refusal to do this is me ""not helping myself"" and that i need ""a good kicking up the backside"" to stop being so lazy and spoilt. this is very painful to hear as my struggles with sleep and insomnia have been agonising for me to go through and the self hatred and punishment he has inspired in me over it is frightening for someone who already has terrible mental health.

the thing is i've attempted to force myself to get up early multiple times before. i've gone a week waking myself up at 10am with about 1-3 hours of sleep each 24hrs before i hit a total mental breakdown and tried to kill myself. i cut myself really deeply and ended up going to the hospital, they kept me for a few days before letting me go. i felt like i was in so much pain physically and mentally over not being able to sleep and like i was cognitively going insane that i got to that state. my dad doesn't take my risk of self harm seriously. 

i believe my reaction was so extreme because of my other mental health problems like depression. since then i ditched the attempt to force myself to wake up early. other things i've attempted is staying up a whole 24 hours and then choosing to go to sleep at a normal time, i succeeded at this once and managed to get up at a normal time during the day for about a month before it slowly inched later and later until i was nocturnal all over again. i've been prescribed temazepam before and it didn't get me to sleep, just made me feel even more tired. since it's addictive i was only given a small dosage. 

however since moving in with my dad he is adamant that i must be woken up earlier and earlier each day. every time he's brought it up he yells at me while i beg him to not wake me up early. 

right now im nocturnal, i get up at 4pm and fall asleep at 7am in the morning. i hate being nocturnal and i cry at night while i try to force myself to fall asleep and fail, knowing my dad will scream at me the next day for it. nothing i do has ever solved my insomnia or circadian rhythm. 

sometimes if i stop trying so hard to sleep at the right time and just let it run it's course it begins to shift naturally to me falling asleep at 4am and getting up at 2pm. in the past i've had time periods where i was able to get up at noon but i've struggled to get to this point for years. 

how do i get him to understand that him forcing me to wake up early isn't going to help me and that i'm terrified i will self harm again if he keeps doing it?",03Jul2020,1
136,"Lately I’ve found myself in a little bit of a bad spot.

I recently started taking medication, Sertraline, for those wondering, and at first it felt as if it was working wonders, everything was going well. But over the past few days things have spiralled out of control, leading to more emotional outbursts and its one of the worst feelings I’ve experienced. The helpless feeling of knowing that even with medication the problems are still present. 

The main issues seem to have been eased somewhat, but are still present - more prevalently found myself questioning reality as of late. The world, and myself, my own perception feels surreal. I can’t exactly self diagnose but I did some looking around and found Depersonalization/Derealization seemed to share a lot of similar traits to what I was feeling - or perhaps a hyper-awareness of one’s own existence. It’s honestly a hard feeling to try and describe.

There’s too much on my mind to really share here, and I’m aware that I should see a professional. I’m working on that for as soon as possible, but obviously, there is no easy fix, and that sort of thing would take a while. 


I suppose what I’m looking for is short term solutions, in the vein of coping, or learning to cope with possible issues until it’s dealt with professionally.

139,"You had a bad day and you think to yourself that tomorrow will be better. This feeling will be your everyday life from now on. As time goes on your mind is slowly making you lose the control of your life. You bare your teeth as your life is slowly getting worse day by day and no matter what you do, you can't reveal your bad Feeling to others. Your thoughts and actions are slowly becoming self-centered, because the feeling that's growing inside you has taken control of your life. You are still not aware of your situation, because you're always thinking of how to hide your feeling from others. Every event where you come in contact with others, you feel like you do not belong there, you are the problem. Every event making the feeling inside you grow stronger.

This is the point when you start distancing yourself from society. Not by choice, but more of a subconscious decision. You start feeling like you're the problem in your circle of people and by distancing yourself from them you're free of the thoughts that everything is against you. This goes on until you've become so distant from others that you're on your own with your thoughts all day long. The feeling consuming you completely, at least that's what it feels like, but you're only in the beginning of this trial. You are so consumed by the feeling inside you that you just can't take it anymore and you start seeking mental healthcare. This is the moment when you start realizing that this is not something you can face alone. Maybe this is depression?

During your mental healthcare you come across something amazing. You start to learn about yourself, what is the reason for everything that has happened in your life. You start learning of these events of the past that has defined everything in you. You are now becoming conscious of who you are, but the problem is that you can't change your past. No matter what, the past will always define the way you are in the future. You can change and overcome the depression, but what for? That is what everyone always says about depression, you just need to stop being depressed. You can't seem to find anything worth living and you just don't want to belong to this world anymore. From now on you struggle everyday with these thoughts in your head, when will it get better. You thought you hit the bottom multiple times during your depression, but the bottom can never be reached. It always surprises you how strong the feeling of depression inside you can get. When will this all end?

Everytime after that I oversleep and have dreams about stuff that I know am inhibiting (partly intentionally) or about just weirdly tiring mix of memories. Then, after waking up, I can't stop thinking about my dreams, and if they were showing my inhibited thoughts, then I would start wondering what could happen if I let them drive my actions (okay, that's actually pretty hard to explain).

So this is the thing: 

My little brother is almost 30 years old. Basically his only content in life is playing video games. Maybe he leaves the house 1-2 times per year except for working of course. 

He never met his father and our mother was one of these mothers doing everything for him. He lived with her until she died 4 years ago. Now I live with him. He wanted food? Mom was doing it. Cleaning and laundry? Mom was doing it. One time I saw him coming home when I was at her place and he went fully bersek when the food was not ready. He said that he send her a message 30min ago that she can now start cooking. She just apologized and was not happy When I got involved. 

I have had my hard times to explain to him that we share any work in the apartment but even after 4 years he is unable to clean. It seems like all activities that do not include being online and playing games are almost impossible for him. He performed bad at work and wonders why. He is about 150kg on 180cm and tries to loose weight. You can imagine how this works. Lunch is like pizza or pasta. Lasagne is like 1Kg at once and cleaning after that is not possible „because I had so much food and need to rest now...“

At some point I need to step in and clean. He knows that but I would turn crazy living in such a mess. 

Any friends or even a girl? Never in his life so far. 

I moved in to support him financially when our mom died but now As he has a job I am about to move out soon.

154,"It’s like every time one bad thing happens to me, 5 more need to happen. 

I’ve been severely depressed with crippling anxiety for about 8 months now, since getting out of an abusive relationship. 

Then I got diagnosed with ADHD 6 months ago and I’ve been cycling through meds. Long story short I failed my uni this year, and had to apply for mitigating circumstances as I couldn’t do any of the work (the circumstances being my depression/anxiety/ADHD). 

It’s been 10x worse since 2020 started. Then lockdown happened so I have no reason to leave my house. Further fuelling my depression. 

To make matters worse my grandma got severely ill abroad and nearly died, and needed a triple heart bypass. I’m 19, and my parents flew out to help her. Obviously because of covid, they got stranded there. My dad has been there for half a year and my mum was there for 2 months, till April. Living alone in the house without my parents support, with my older brother, whilst dealing with depression and PTSD from my abusive relationship was the toughest thing ever. 

My brother didn’t do anything for the two months. I was cooking every single day and trying to save my uni work. I was exhausted and tired of life and questioned my existence/living. 

I got into a new relationship but with someone I trust with my entire life. He’s been my closest friend for 3 years now, so we know we’re in this for good. However my mum suddenly flipped after seeing what happened with my abusive ex. So she said she didn’t condone it. (She’s also very religious/strict and conservative). She ignored me for a week straight before she went abroad for 2 months. It was the most painful thing as I was still so depressed and she was my main support system, we’ve always been close as sisters, so her ignoring me for a week was a big deal. 

I overdosed on my ADHD meds and cried to her face and said I love her and she just got up and walked out on me without a word. I felt so alone. 

Since coming back from abroad she’s realised her mistakes and we’ve repaired our relationship back to how it was. 

My dad is still stranded abroad with my grandad. My relationship is going well and that’s the one good thing in my life rn. 

Then about 3 weeks ago my best friend of 5 years moved across the country. I feel so alone without her. I used to see her every day at uni, and every day through high school. I miss her so much, she feels so far away. She moved right when my depression had a really bad episode. I literally just laughed, because I didn’t think things could get worse, and then she suddenly moved across country within a week. 

Then it happened. On the 29th June 2020 I lost my closest aunty to a long and painful battle against cancer. I’m crying just writing this. She was my mums closest friend for 25 years. She was like a second mother to me, I’d go to her for everything. She was closer to mum than her own blood sisters and my mum was closer to her than any of her family. 
I saw her die in the hospice. We al had to wear masks and couldn’t comfort her children or her elderly parents or hug them. I saw her lying there. I kissed her through my mask and stroked her face. She was so cold. I miss her so much. 

I can’t imagine how her children feel. Her youngest is only 18, and he said that all he’s ever known is her having cancer and being in hospital. He also doesn’t have a good relationship with his dad and isn’t close with his siblings, so I’m worried for him and he must feel so alone. My aunty was diagnosed when he was just starting high school. Her other son was about to get married next month. She was so so excited, she adored his fiancé. And now she won’t be there to witness her own child’s wedding. And then her eldest just had a baby weeks before her death. She only got to see her newborn grandson once due to covid. And only for 10 minutes as she was in and out of consciousness from pain and medication. 

Her poor elderly parents are in shock. They keep questioning “why did our child go so young, it was meant to be us. It should’ve been us that went first”. I can’t imagine how it must feel for them, it’s so unnatural losing your child at that age. She was only 55. 

I also hate thinking about the pain she was in. She also faced a lot of injustice and difficult periods in her life. She had it tough but she was one of the most radiant, warm souls I’ve ever met. 

I’m planning on getting married this/next year, as I know that this man, my best friend for so many years, is the one for me and it’s been staring me in the face all these years and we never saw it. He’s been so supportive through my depression.  We want a very small wedding. My aunty, God bless her soul, was the first person I told my mum I want to be there, sitting front row. Idk how I’ll get through the wedding without completely breaking down, not seeing her there. Every time I’ve pictured it, she’s been there. 

We couldn’t even go to her funeral due to covid. Only 10 people allowed. So we visited after and did some prayers. It was tough. 

Tried therapy but there’s only 4 sessions on the NHS so it did absolutely nothing. 

I’ve been on and off antidepressants and they did nothing so I’m off them now again. I just needed to vent about the train wreck that’s been my life. I’ve also lost a lot of very close friends on top of all this over the last few years, who betrayed me in different ways. I’m tired of losing people.

159,"I’m the type that has a few very, very close friends. in two weeks i’m going to move back to the city i grew up in, right after a weeklong vacation with two of my friends. it was easy finding an apartment and i’m confident i’ll be able to find a job. i have friends close to me that love me a lot, all but one being in different states but still we keep in touch enough to know each other’s every day lives. i live a good life.
but i’m currently having a pretty hard time eating. in the past week i’ve only been able to keep down three meals + one dessert. i have a concussion, and i was also on my period when the nausea started (only vomited twice) so i’m not concerned about it being anything too serious quite yet. but i’m also experiencing a complete lack of motivation the past few days. i feel as if the world is ending soon so there’s no point to try and be a better person. i feel like i’ve put out a lot of evil into the world and i cant shake the feeling i’m more harm than good. i also can’t seem to feel connected to any of my friends. one specifically made the comment of “why am i having to find things for us to talk about? you’re not really talking or reacting” and id just been thinking about the end of the world and how hot the chicken wing i ate was. i’m unable to sleep, even though i have been keeping my phone outside my room so that i don’t stay up. it’s been taking 2 or 3 hours to get to sleep, then i have nightmares about losing people i love, or the end of the world. my mind feels foggy, i have messed up simple things at work, even though i’m a manager and have worked there for a year and a half. 

but the thing is none of this feels like depression i’ve had before. i have no reason. and this came on very suddenly about a week ago. i cant tell you how many times i’ve cried this past week not really understanding why. i’m not sure what’s going on. i see a therapist and my mental health is typically pretty well managed. i know how to talk myself down and how to treat myself. i’m pretty self aware. but i’m freaked out that i don’t understand what’s going on right now.",03Jul2020,1

161,"My friend (friend A) recently opened up to me and a friend (friend B) about an issue she experienced with her family, when we were talking in a group chat. Maybe it was because of the awkward nature of texting communication, but friend B and I were unsure how to respond and it took us a while to say something. Because of this, friend A responded that she didn't think she should have opened up about her problems in the first place, and then she doesn't want us to have to deal with her problems. 

This really sucks because me and friend B really want to help and hope she gives us the opportunity to do so (or at least try?). However, I'm kinda worried because I don't want to open up again only for us to not know what to say yet again, which may only make her more hesitant to open up in the future. Maybe texting just sucks for this type of communication and maybe we would have more luck speaking over a video chat. I suggested that we talk over voice chat but there's been no answer and I imagine she's avoiding going on the group chat maybe to avoid a conversation that from her perspective probably makes things awkward and uncomfortable (but maybe I'm reading too much into it?). 

I'm kinda unsure what to do. I want to talk to her in video form, but I want to know what to say. Any advice?",03Jul2020,1
162,"I’m in a very precarious position here 

My best friend, who I was living with, recently has been making some poor decisions that have placed both of our safety at risk.  This is someone I am very close to for many many years - we have met each other’s families, that’s sort of thing 

One incident in particular was so serious, that it caused me to move out in the middle of the night.   Some more events occurred after I moved out - I was contacted by police (I was in his emergency contacts) because he was drugged at a restaurant, and was found unable to speak.  After this incident, I got back in touch with him to check on him and he was crying asking me to come over since he was scared and alone.  He said some suicidal things and I kept pleading with him to talk to a counselor.  He was trying to tell me he didn’t want to do that, he is too afraid of being “committed.”  I told him it’s only 3 days, you’ll be okay if you do this

He texted me saying he called reporting suicidal thoughts, and he is an ambulance being taken to the hospital.  I told him I’m sorry for everything that’s happened (we had a lot of conflict this week which led to this).  and he asked me if he should call his parents, who live in another state.  I said YES absolutely, they would want to know this 

I have not heard from him since, so I think this means he is in a 72 hour hold and they took his cell phone.  

I have been debating very hard about texting his mother.  A while back, his mother gave me her phone number for emergencies.  I’ve never called or texted her.  I don’t even know if he contacted her or  if I should contact her, what do I say, etc.",03Jul2020,1

Idk why but it could be because I feel overwhelmed due to the stuff I put on myself. If that is the case though I can basically give up on my dream because getting to that would be even harder. **I really need help because I have no clue what I should even do. I just want to sleep and never wake up again.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I am 17 years old (M) and for a few weeks now I am totally hopeless. I lost all the fun in my life. I used to have a lot of hobbies and interests but in recent weeks I am just lying on my bed with no energy. Suicidal thoughts have become  the only content of my life and I have also not eaten anything in 2 days - I lost my appetite and can barely motivate me to drink some water here and there. 

My problem is that I don't really understand why I am feeling so badly.  Until recently I was super happy, always optimistic and basically checked every box in the ""happy life"" checklist (i know that something like that doesn't exist but you will get what I am saying.):

* I worked out 3 times a week 
* I had a healthy diet
* I was always drinking at least 3L (nearly 1 us gallon) of water a day
*  I am good at school and Work (It's time for me now to apply to university, I am easily good enough to get accepted by all the univercities in my area.) 
* I meditate everyday
* I journal everyday
* I take a walk for 1H/ day everyday (in addition to my workout)
* I have several Hobbies

Despite all that I'm just feeling super unmotivated in recent weeks. I broke it down to 3 things that **might** be the cause of my sadness but I am unsure about it and what I take from this is even more depressing:

\- Loneliness: I'm quite an introverted person so I have never been keen about meeting with other people or anything. I currently don't have any friends but I don't think that that is the problem. I am actually a fairly decent to be around I think. I got invited to a lot of parties before Covid-19 but I declined most of the time because I dislike company. 

I do value some nice discussion about topics I enjoy but because of my feelings in recent weeks I don't really enjoy anything so that isn't really a thing anymore either.

\-Overthinking: I'm overthinking way too much and I know that. I am simulating a lot of scenarios in my head all the time. In addition to that **every** solution I come up with I overthink every aspect of it and go down a spiral where I whine about how inaccurate and manipulative the human brain is. This really makes me feel horrible because it instatly puts me into this feeling of life sucks and there is no point in pursuing anything anyways.

It also makes me  think that every little thing is shit and even if it's just a conversation that I can't get around I lose all hope and sink into this feeling of absolute uselessness and worthlessness.

\-Overwhelmed: This sounds like the most realistic cause for my bad mood tbh. It's not because of school or anything but because of what I put on myself in my freetime ( I want to learn a lot of new stuff and if I can't accomplish what I set myself as a goal for that day I will hate myself when I go to bed). The problem I have with facing this truth is that It's not even that much or at least it's not much in comparison with what I have to deal with if I choose to chase the careerpath that I am aiming for eversince I am 12 years old. 

This really makes me think that I am useless because my dream (career) seems much more out of touch than ever before - it's becomming more and more of a dreamand less and less of a reality everyday. 

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to my parents about my feelings but my mom thinks it's just a lack of nutricion and my dad thinks it's because I am not partying every weekend like he did when he was 17.

175,"Hello!

I'm really upset and need someone to talk to or help me out. I'm 22 and after 12 years of mental health issues I finally decided to get some help and I finally found a Psychiatrist that takes my insurance and was accepting new patients during COVID. I've been diagnosed with ADD, severe anxiety, and bipolar Disorder, and JUST started taking medication.

When I went to get my prescription filled I found out my psych didn't send authorization to my insurance company and I had to pay $60 or wait a week and hope he calls them and explains the medical necessity for it. Apparently he has to do it every month I want to have prescriptions filled. I emailed him about it, I paid the $60 (that I really didn't have) and thought it was going to be fine. He just sent me an email saying:

""I have been practicing for many years, with many insurance companies, and have never had a situation where there is a requirement to seek specific authorization each month for the medication.  This is a time-consuming process (it often takes 1-2 hours) and if your insurance, in your case, requires this on my part, I am afraid that I will not be able to do this and continue to treat you.""

180,"Oh yes 2020, what a year! Who would have known right?! One moment, we’re all living our same-old, normal lives and BAM! A new-born deadly organism threatens life all over the planet and forces everyone to lock themselves at home.

They say humans are social animals and for the right reasons, we aren’t meant to be cooped up in our houses for extended periods of time. Social interaction is a very important aspect of our lives, unsurprisingly, taking that away drives us completely insane. But there’s more to it than it seems!

# 1) We love Routines!

Okay before you click away, just hear me out. The very fact that you’re here on Medium, reading articles on self improvement and betterment rather than binge-watching Sherlock on Netflix is enough to say that you are someone who takes their life very seriously and have high expectations from yourself. (and that’s applicable even if you did binge-watch Netflix, I know I did.)

Humans are creatures of habit, we freaking love Certainty! We love knowing what’s coming next and we enjoy being prepared. I mean think about it, our bodies adjust and refine themselves according to the external stimulus. That’s why you, at least for the most part, feel sleepy as the daylight recedes and darkness fills the sky. Your ancestors from 1000 years before did that and its coded in your cells.

If you eat your lunch at 12 noon every single day for a few months and forget to eat at the same time one fine day, the growling of your stomach will most definitely remind you. You see, when our bodies notice a pattern, it conditions itself to adapt accordingly so as to make our lives easier.

What our bodies also love is predictability. Haha no surprise here! To understand it in the easiest way possible, consider Homeostasis. Here’s an example- Our body has a tendency to regulate our internal temperature to 98.6°F (37°C) no matter how hot or cold it is outside. If it gets too hot, you start sweating to cool down yourself as sweat evaporates. Too cold? Healthline says “A shiver is caused by your muscles tightening and relaxing in rapid succession. This involuntary muscle movement is your body’s natural response to getting colder and trying to warm up.”

You get the gist of it, right? Well the lockdown imposed in response to this pandemic has shattered all the routines we set for ourselves. Routines- the only constants in the otherwise unpredictable, chaotic life. See where I’m getting at?

The lack of a routine, the very same one that you spent years perfecting no matter how difficult it must have been, was effectively triggered void. Suddenly everything stopped making sense.

&gt; ###### **What can you do about it?**

But it gets better you know. You might feel as if you’re stuck in rut of endless unproductivity and fruitlessness. All you need to do to get out of this is establish a discipline to your life. And I don’t mean allot activities to every minute of your life.

Just make an attempt to get your life back on track slowly and steadily. Start by just adding one productive habit to your life right now and follow it religiously everyday. Make sure to keep this habit easy and simple or the resistance will kill the motivation.

If you want to be healthy, start by exercising 2 minutes a day. If you wish to read more, aim to read for 2 minutes in a day. Only increase the time once you start looking forward to it. As and when you start adjusting to this new habit, add another and work it up the same way. Flexibility and adaption is the only way to survive.

# 2) Our Fear of Darkness

Man has always been afraid of the dark, both figuratively and literally. But it’s not really the darkness that we’re afraid of, rather what it represents- The Unknown.

I mean think about it, we’re afraid of what we don’t know, the mysterious, the supernatural. We fear anything that our minds cannot comprehend with logic and reason, so much so that we tell ourselves lies just to pacify the roaring mind.

And this is not a new pattern, we as humans, have always feared the unknown. Religion has been a very integral concept of human civilization, also a very successful one. It is easier and more convincing to believe that the world is created and maintained by something supernatural, something far superior to humans rather than by mere coincidence. People want to feel hopeful, they like to have a sense of familiarity than deal with the agony of fear and mystery.

You see, all this talk about darkness and atheism is not irrelevant. It indicates a pattern, our tendency to manifest and nourish anxiety when the future seems clouded with uncertainty. When will things get back to normal? Will I lose my job? Has my health been compromised? Do I have enough money? A once purposeful life suddenly rendered meaningless. Anxiety is a monster, one that dwells among fear and uncertainty. The lack of control over our life can feel hopeless and powerless to say the least. And hopelessness breeds further anxiety.

&gt; ###### **What can you do about it?**

Now that we’ve established that lack of control over our life is the cause of anxiety, all we have to do is bring about order and control to our life. Easier said than done right? There’s no harm in trying!

Like I already mentioned previously, one of the fastest way to take back control of your life is committing to a routine. Routines represent discipline and a sort of authority over the actions in your life.

Educate yourself with respect to your anxiety until it fearing it seems futile. If your concern is not having enough money, sit down and make a record of all you bank balance, expenses and incomes. Carefully evaluate your account statements and jot down the necessary changes.

Make plans! Back-up plans! Lots of them. Imagine the worst and armor yourself with shield of well-preparedness and strategy. Anxiety has no base to thrive if you take away to uncertainty factor.

# 3) Claustrophobia

Claustrophobia, like any other phobia is an irrational fear. An irrational fear of being trapped in closed spaces. Although claustrophobia is a real mental health disorder, I intend to use it figuratively rather than literally. Mental health issues are very much real and I don’t mean to subside its validity.

Being cooped up inside four walls for extended period of time is not really something we as humans are meant to be, rather any animal for that matter. Having literally no real social interaction isn’t just miserable but takes a toll on mental health.

Correct me if I’m wrong but the sense of loneliness is overwhelming since being quarantined. And that’s coming from me- a hardcore introvert. I am guilty of taking the long way home just so I avoid meeting people I know. I’ve always dreaded being in crowds and found comfort in the solitude of my four bedroom walls. Yes, I’ve definitely been alone but never really felt lonely.

Perhaps the difference between solitude and loneliness is willingness. Lesson learned-forced by the circumstances to be alone evokes loneliness rather than solitude.

&gt;###### **What you can do about it**

Catch up with your friends and relatives- they probably are lonely too. The other day one of my close friend happened to call me for something work related. We talked about that for a few minutes and spent time catching up for the rest 80 minutes.

Exercise. Yes I know how cliche and blah blah but believe me when I say it, it helps. Maybe because you trick your mind into substituting physical activity for social interaction. I completely stopped exercising since the outbreak and just started again a few weeks back and it makes so much difference in my life. I’m just doing for merely 10 minutes now cause I don’t want it to feel resisting.

This new situation is to remain for quite sometime, and we must make an effort and try our best to adjust to the new normal. I’m not going to lie, I don’t enjoy this but what does kill us makes us stronger right? And what even are we if not adaptable, we made it through the world wars and the plagues, this too shall pass. Perhaps this will make a good story to tell our kids and grand-kids.

181,"Hey there, hope I'm posting to the right subreddit, r/AmItheAsshole sent me here. Apologies as English is not my first language.

Basically  I (30f) am struggling with my corporate job and have had bad anxiety,  barely getting out of bed, not been able to work, logging in on zoom  meetings only when high on antianxiolytics. I have a story of mental  health issues: burnout, low energy level and motivation, anxiety,  depression, psychotic thoughts. Earlier this year I was put on a  2-months sick leave and had to take a neuroleptic on top of the  antidepressant I've been taking for 3 years now. I have covered up my  failures at work the best I could and been upfront about feeling  overwhelmed (while staying vague about the cause) with my boss who is  actually happy with my performance and wants me to stay and grow in the  company.

However, I feel like this  situation will only get worse as I don't see how I can continue  performing in this job with such crippling thoughts, every day is a  uphill battle and I feel like Sisyphus. I feel like one day I will lash  out or disappear. I figured if I could just quit my job I would have the  mental space to work on bettering myself and figuring out what I want  to do with myself/who I want to be as a person.

Now  this decision does not just involve me. I have a husband (36m) that has  been struggling to find a job for a year so our whole household rely on  my income. He was working when we met 5 years ago but then 3 years ago I  had to move and he followed me in a new country, went back to school to  get such country diploma and learn the language. Given the current  economic situation, it could be anything from a month to a year before  he finds a new job that matches his skills.

So  if I quit, we will both be living solely on the state financial aid and  thus will need to sell our furnitures and move again, probably to a  small town in a rural area, which will make it harder for him to get a  job and put us both in a precarious situation.

I  am wrecked with guilt no matter which solution I lean toward. Neither  my therapist and psychiatrist want to weigh in. My mom thinks I should  go back on heavier medication so I can put up with my job (as the  neuroleptic makes me artificially more passive and accepting) and my  husband is supporting whichever decision I will take.

So I am turning to you, reddit. Thank you :)",03Jul2020,2
182,"Hey r/mentalhealth, I'm here to ask how to seek help. I've come to believe that a lot of the difficulties in my life may not just be ""the way it is,"" and I believe at least some of them may be a result of undiagnosed depression, anxiety, adhd, some combination of the 3, or something totally different. I've come to believe that life doesn't have to be this difficult and that I can do something about it, and I know that realizing I *can* do something about it is the first step for me.

I'm lost on the next step. I'm M/28/US, and the closest things I've done to visiting a doctor since I stopped living with my parents have been an appendectomy and a couple CVS MinuteClinic visits for a flu test and a stubborn athletes foot infection. I don't have a primary care provider, and I don't know what to do. I think my unwillingness to find one may be an anxiety coping mechanism, I won't get anxious if I don't do anything I'm uncertain about. That is a bit of a cycle though, because it means I don't deal with anything. Prior to COVID-19, I was able to cope through a regular work schedule, but working from home long-term has made it more difficult and that's why I'm finally making this post - It's the only thing I could think of to figure out what to do.

So, reddit, what should I do? I can find an ""Internal Medicine"" doctor through my insurance provider, but I don't want to get to an appointment only to be told ""Sorry, you need to see a psychologist/psychiatrist"". I could try and set up an appointment with a psychiatrist, but I don't understand health insurance enough to know if I need to see my nonexistent PCP first for a referral or something. I could set up something with a psychologist/therapist, but honestly that scares me for some damn reason even though it shouldn't - I think I've internalized some sort of stigma that therapy is for people with some kinda trauma or some real heavy shit to work out and that my problems aren't ""enough"" to warrant it. By that, I mean I don't have any major trauma, I'm content with my career and I'm mostly able to manage my work every day, I just struggle with some things most people seem to not have any issue with, such as nonexistent motivation, excessive procrastination ( see paragraph above as an example), and minor things seeming like too much work so I put them off which compounds the problem (e.g. I don't feel like cleaning up after dinner, I'll do it tomorrow, and then the next day, and then my apartment is such a mess that I wouldn't want anyone to see it, but then because nobody is gonna see it I can put it off another day or 30).

What should I do to stop struggling with things that shouldn't be hard?

Edit thanks to the AutoMod comment: I'm not exactly looking for specific resources, more just some direction on what resources I should find myself, but screw my ""I'll do it myself, just give me direction"" attitude this time, it hasn't exactly worked out for me so far in this context. I'm in Charlotte, NC, United States in case anyone has any specific recommendations. I know I'm not the only one out there in this boat, though, so I also hope for general advice so it might help anyone else in my position who comes across this post.",03Jul2020,1

185,"I know lots of people have had birthdays since the whole covid thing and missed out on their usual celebrations. But it just really sucks to be cooped up for months and then have my birthday effectively be canceled. My favorite thing to do on this day is to watch fireworks from a big crowd of people and eat food from street vendors and basically be a part of something that so many people are enjoying. I thought about renting a hotel in a city that didn't cancel their fireworks and watching from the hotel room, but it's been impossible to talk to someone who works at the actual hotels to confirm the room has a view. And it's not just the fireworks that 'make it my birthday'.

Last year my birthday was pretty disappointing because of my mental health. I wasn't myself and was socially isolating and basically just slept all day. So I was looking forward to having a decent one this year. I also kind of feel like if I tried explaining this to anyone else, they'd just be like, ""Yeah we wanted to see fireworks too.""",03Jul2020,1

What I disagree with is that his doctor told him he should go off cold turkey. I’ve had this argument with my partner before. He’s prescribed antidepressants (for depression or other reason) but never by a mental health expert. 

So when he told me this morning, that his doctor told him cold turkey, I was upset. I said never go cold turkey and he told me he has a plan to take one every other day. Bad idea. He told me to watch him in case he does something. Once I told him it was a bad idea (I’ve been on antidepressants and other psych meds for probably close to ten years) he flipped out.

196,"I don’t care if anyone reads this I just want to get it out somehow

I’ve always had really bad anxiety but I’ve always been very pro-active about dealing with it, I have tons of coping methods and I do everything to make it better

Well basically covid-19 left me unemployed and back home with my family (which is a really toxic environment as my Dad and brother are very bad alcoholics) and I have been applying to all these jobs that I feel so unqualified for. I was enthusiastic in the beginning, I thought that I would at least get through to one round of interviews maybe but it’s been months and I’ve heard nothing from anyone. I’ve started to feel like I should just give up and go back to my undergrad job at a tea shop but they’re not even hiring because of the pandemic.

So slowly I felt my anxiety coming back except I don’t have the same access to my coping methods because I sold my musical instrument and I don’t live alone anymore so I don’t want to exercise because I hate the thought of somebody even being in the same place when I exercise (idk why I just get embarrassed, really anxious about it, that’s why I never go to gyms and I hate exercising outside). 

Once my anxiety kicked in it was relentless and I started feeling like my family was resenting me for being home. Now I’m not sleeping, I’m panicky, and I’ve slowed down applying to jobs because I feel so depressed thinking about how they’ll probably not even email me back. I believe now I’m not qualified for anything I apply for even though I probably am 

Logically I know I’m starting to spiral and I should keep trucking and find new coping mechanisms and I know I’ll eventually get hired somewhere but for now I just feel horrible in every possible way.",03Jul2020,1

199,"TW for discussions of weight, diet, food.

My dosage of Wellbutrin was upped from 150 mg to 300 about 3 weeks ago. I basically haven't felt hunger since then.

I haven't been weighed since March, but last week I went to a doctor's appointment and it turns out I've lost 10 lbs at some point since then. That would be basically about 7.5% of my body mass, which is why I'm more concerned. I've been unemployed, pretty sedentary, at home since March bc of COVID so if anything I would have expected gain. I already lost 50 lbs last year just from depression.

Eating has never been an issue for me. As it turns out I might be ADHD, working on finding assessment centers w/ my psychiatrist and therapist, but basically we've determined I'm ""feeling"" motivated. As in, I just don't do things if I don't feel like it, despite wanting to, being able to, or knowing I need to. So eating has become very hard when I don't feel hunger.

Even things I enjoy, like sweets, are hard to eat, but they make up a good portion of my daily diet now. I know that isn't particularly healthy but it's better than nothing. Cooking is out of the question, I've been relying on my parents to make home cooked meals, which typically are very healthy as we have a garden this summer. But I'll eat maybe one meal like that in a day, much smaller serving than I would have had 6 months ago. I've never counted calories before but if I had to guess I would imagine I'm eating 1000 or less calories in a day, and it doesn't feel particularly good at the end of the day if I forgot to eat at all.

TLDR; Basically I'm asking anyone else who's been on Wellbutrin/bupropion how do I keep eating when I can't feel hunger? I think the medicine is otherwise very effective for my depression, particularly my executive dysfunction, but this seems like something that could snowball very easily.",03Jul2020,3

201," 

Hi! I’m writing this before you have agreed to read this because I really enjoy writing and bullshiting. What I’m writing about is the difference and similarities between Eastern and Western medicine. Remember to take this essay as a grain of salt. As we know from Chemistry class, table salt is Na+ Cl- held together with ionic bonds. We believe this to be true because when salt is dissolved into water, it is not a solid or grain anymore, and it conducts electricity when passing a current. Is this our explanation of what sea salt is? How can we be so sure? That was just a primer of thought before I continue about medicine.

Let us ask a medical professional how depakote works. Medical professionals will come out with an explanation that GABA is the culprit neurotransmitter to cause mood stabilization in bipolar patients and people with epilepsy. As a person diagnosed with bipolar, this only eases my curiosity to a certain age before I wonder why it doesn’t work. Are medical professionals lying to me for my own good? Is GABA or neurotransmitters just a “santa claus” explanation discovered in order to ease the curiosity of the kid so they live life in ignorance to the truth till death? This link is a whole explanation of how GABA is discovered, but I don’t expect a reader to read it because I’ll speak for the majority of people, that they don’t read into studies before they claim. That’s because when we hear double blind study that we KNOW is the gold standard for proofs; end of conversation or else you are labeled bipolar for the rest of your life for bringing disruption in other people’s lives. Also, please question your own beliefs before you judge me by my cover as being a bipolar and that none of my logic makes sense. Also, please don’t be one of medical professionals that say “don’t have children because you will spread your bipolar genes”. Rather give the person a sexually transmitted disease/infection test and give the diagnosis of HIV. Then as a medical professional, you know you scared the bejesus of them to never have sex again because they want the best for their partners. Okay my venting is over, let me compare western medicine with eastern.

There are so much similarities with Eastern and Western medicine. Both types of medicine give explanations to why a patient is feeling a certain way. But one is more likely to conclude that “I don’t know how to fix your problem”. Maybe it’s the practitioner not the style. I’m still alive unlike many of the great writers of the past.

204,"My brother (20) was a huge fan of the gamer ""Reckful"" who committed suicide recently, and my mother (that he lives with) told me that his mental health has taken a big hit from this. 

He struggles with some mental health issues himself, and I think it that, besides mourning the loss of a hero of his, he is worried that there might not be ""light at the end of the tunnel"" regarding his depression, as there wasn't for his hero/inspiration. He took it hard too when Chester Bennington passed a few years back from suicide, and these feelings are resurfacing as well now. 

How can I show him that besides these really tragic and terrible situations, there is a way out and suicide is not the solution? We have never been the most touchy-feely or talkative of siblings, but our parents doesn't quite get it, and I want to make sure that he isn't having thoughts of his own like this.

205,"I see suffering everywhere. On every level. The older members of my family are slowing aging. My friends all have issues with things such as anxiety, eating disorders and feelings of inadequacy. All of humanity is suffering with this pandemic, the growing threat of climate change, lack of resources, over consumption of resources, inability to understand their own thought and emotions. 

I find myself increasing apathetic. I increasingly want to retreat into my own world of video games, porn and self harm. Things to dull the pain. I feel a intense self hatred at my actions and a feeling of overpowering worthless. When I was young I think I found joy in helping people and the world as a whole. But this goal feels increasing meaningless. I can't really help people. Suffering is embedding into the structure of the world. I had caring parents who still provide me with everything. And yet I can't pull myself together. 

My attempts at therapy haven't really changed anything. I still feel anxious about the future and still procrastinating doing anything productive. Is it just another waste of my parents money?

And underneath it as is the shame. My mother suffered similar things and still went on to be a doctor and help many people. My therapist themselves hinted they lost someone during the pandemic and yet after only a month break they are still wanted to start helping people again. People suffer through so much pain and yet are still hopeful. They don't back down and retreat into their own worlds. All the nurses, doctors, shop workers, care workers, teachers, firefighters etc. They don't stop working. They keep going in spite of everything. 

I can only wonder how. I feel my life slowly dissolve. I can managed enough at uni, procrastinating and doing things at the last minute. But well enough. But I am terrified of work. Of responsibly. I am afraid my girlfriend my release my inadequate nature and level me. But I really love her and she loves me. At least the parts that she sees. But I think if people saw the poison underneath me they would realise there is no hope for me.

206,"As I type this I am on vacation with my family (dads side cause parents are divorced) alone in the condo feeling bad for myself. I don’t even know where to begin describing what’s going on because it seems that every little thing that happens pisses me off. Just some back ground info I’m 17yrs old M, 6’3” 155lbs and just started a t break from cannabis (which while I don’t have a card, I still use it illegally to treat my Tourette’s syndrome.)  I started my break the morning we left for the beach which was Wed July 1st and didn’t bring anything with me so I couldn’t be tempted to give up on my break like I have every prior attempt. Before starting my break I was going through about a gram of wax about every 2-3 days, plus a g cart and an 8th of flower in about a week just to switch it up since probably a little before thanksgiving.  I know a bunch of people go through a lot more than that but for my current financial situation it makes sense to suffer through a break thank go keep paying $150 is dollars a week just to stay somewhat buzzed if you could even call it that. 

I know I’m depressed but since I’ve started my break it feels like I’ve developed every fucking mental illness imaginable and it’s driving me insane. First of all I’ve been super critical of every inconvenience and arguing with anything I hear that I know isn’t %100 true, it’s like I can’t hold my tongue for any reason and it’s starting to get me in trouble with my parents since I have to talk back to them any opportunity I get.  We’ve spent 3 nights at the beach so far and every single morning I have woken up way earlier than my sleep schedule usually would allow, I’ve woken up with cold sweats and random joint pain that I don’t remember going to sleep with. 

And to touch up on the depression part that I previously stated. I have terrible self worth issues and can’t let anyone know that I’m struggling ever because I don’t think I’m worth worrying about. I know that it would %100 be in my best interest to go to a therapist but my parents are divorced and I would want to financially burden either one of them. I’ve worked a part time job since I turned 16  because I want to pay for everything So that my parents have to spend as little on me as possible. 

One of the biggest contributing factors to my depression would definitely be my mother. I love my mother but I don’t know how at this point because she can make me feel like the biggest piece of shit in the world with just a couple words. I feel like she uses that against me to keep me under her finger and do all of her chores for her. Which I’m not saying I mind to help her but that’s the thing, she asks for me to help her with stuff and then leaves me alone to do it by myself. As I stated I’m 17rn and I’m turning 18 on the 19th of this month. But my mother has blatantly told me she will not let me move out when I turn 18 which I know I wouldn’t need her blessing or anything but I know life would be much easier if I could get her support.

208,"So I have been seeing a Consultant Psychiatrist for over a year. Half of that time has been virtual as I moved areas. I felt she had been great and we had a good relationship. 

Anyway on Wednesday for the first time I took cocaine cos I was so low, I then took a slightly larger dose of my prescribed sleeping pills than normal (22.5mg Zopiclone) and 1mg Xanax as I cudn’t sleep. I then panicked and went to A&amp;E to make sure I hadn’t put myself in danger. They weren’t overly concerned and said I should def contact my psychiatrist to discuss. So I sent her a message explaining what had happened, that I went to A&amp;E and was safe and would like to arrange a consultation when she was free to discuss.  

This was my text:

Hello Dr. Xxxxx, this is (name removed). Apologies for contacting you unawares but I wanted to explain the last couple of weeks my symptoms have gotten worse. Things got a bit bad and I ended up in A&amp;E yesterday. I told the A&amp;E consultant that I had my own psychiatrist that I would speak to, and that I would make contact with you. I know how busy you are at the moment but if you had time for a consultation I’d really appreciate it. Thanks 

This is their reply:

Xxxx I do not have time to reply to this message or emails today. You need to accept any mental health care that is offered to you locally in the NHS. If you are in crisis I am not able to adequately help you manage risks to yourself in (location removed) at a distance from (location removed). Unfortunately I am not able to offer an emergency support service. I’m pleased you went to A and E in crisis and you can attend again if necessary . Your GP can refer you to the local mental health crisis team for over the weekend. I’m sorry I am not able to offer a crisis service. 

I wasn’t asking for an emergency treatment and made it clear that I was keeping myself safe by going to A&amp;E of my own accord. I think my email wasn’t pushy or needy, I just wanted to arrange a consultation. I was rather upset to receive this message and will now look for a different psychiatrist.

209,"I'm really not doing well right now. Going to be a long post, so appreciate anyone willing to read through.

First issue, is a very complicated situation with a guy I know. To try and keep things as short as possible, he and I met 2 years ago and started off as fwb. A few months in, he said he was too conflicted between me and another fwb and was shutting everything down sexually. He said he was figuring out feelings for her, which hurt. Fast forward a few months and he drops a bombshell on me that they're in a relationship. I was devastated and things weren't good between us for several months. They broke up a few months later and of course, I wanted things to rekindle with him and I. After months of excuses, it comes back to him deciding if he was going to get back together with her. A few weeks ago, he initiates a conversation with me that he has decided they aren't going to get back together, but he doesn't want anything with anyone right now.

Not easy to hear, especially since it's been almost 2 years of us not having sex and I haven't stopped wanting it back and for things to go back to how they were. There's been some soft sexual activity (dry humping), but he says he's got this ""block"" where he can't go further than that. 

We've been fighting a lot lately because I've made it clear that I'm not happy with things as they are. He's said he needs to just have some space to figure out what, if anything, he wants. I would be understanding of this, and I am still going to give him space, but I've heard it before and don't trust it. He's said he's gone back to being platonic and then resumed things with this other woman numerous times and I don't doubt he will again. This absolutely tears me apart and makes it nearly impossible to do what he's asking. I've flat out asked him what I need to do for him to reconsider things with me and hit ""for starters, stop bringing it up"". I feel like he's just manipulating me to get me off his back instead of having the decency to be honest with me. So, now I'm wrestling with walking away entirely because I'm just sick of it.


Second issue, my relationship with my siblings, sisters especially, is strained. My youngest sister and I have lived in the same city for about the last two years, and she never replies to my messages, calls, etc and almost never initiates contact with me. I stopped trying to reach out to her quite a while ago because it's just draining. I won't see her for 6+ months and am genuinely excited to see her, but within minutes she has to make some bitchy comment and it's disheartening to deal with. I've called her out on it and she constantly makes excuses - she's too busy, she claims to her phone isn't sending her messages/calls (I work for a cell company so I know that's bs). My other sister is better about keeping in contact, but same behaviour - I maybe see her twice a year and the last time we went on vacation and both of them wanted nothing to do with me. I've reached the point where I just give up, because I don't know what to do anymore.



Third issue, I've just moved out of a place I was renting and my landlords are giving me a headache. They're trying to pin water damage on the baseboards and windowsills on me when they've admitted it looks like there is water coming in from somewhere (we've had a lot of rain over the last few weeks) and that their baseboards also have water damage, to a lesser extent, just from mopping - ie, the contractors used poor quality materials. Now they aren't giving me an answer about what the findings were when they had their home builder come in to inspect. It's probably going to have to go to court, which is a whole headache I really don't want to deal with.

I'm just at my wits end right now. I'm stressed out, worn out, heartbroken and just tired of all of it. I'm alone and have no one to talk to and am not taking care of myself. I just can't snap out of it.",03Jul2020,1

220,"i know that this kind of question is meant for a psychiatrist, but i don’t have health insurance so reddit it is. i figured some of you might have experiences with this type of thing, i don’t know. 

A little backstory- last august i went through a very horrible, manipulative breakup. about a month later, i finally told myself enough was enough and i forced myself to get over it after i started talking to someone else that had recently moved several hours away, which resulted in me moving up there to be with them because i had nothing left for me in the position that i was in, so why not. only people that cared about me enough was my parents and a couple of close friends who were supportive of my move (my friends, i might add, not my parents). the relationship after moving was great at first, but then it started to get really rocky and became toxic very quickly. i spent about 9 months there, and decided to move back home after a another failed relationship that i was mentally manipulated in and ignored sexually/physically/emotionally for the last 4 months of it. 

i’ve been home since may, living with my parents again like i was before i moved away, working the same job i had as before, my room even decorated the same way as i had it before, and it’s starting to feel like i never left and that the things in that time period never happened. over the last couple of months my brain has pushed out almost every single memory i’ve had of living away from home- from relationship things, friendships, working, etc. i can’t recall certain things about my ex partner, i can’t remember conversations or memories of pictures. it’s only gotten worse and i don’t know if it’s the emotional trauma that’s making me forget or what. text messages, pictures, and people on social media are the only grips i have with reality right now. 

so my question is, when does something like this need to be considered concerning?",03Jul2020,1

It’s a very small scene towards the end of the movie. The T-Rex is walking through the suburbs at night where it crashes through a fence to drink water from a pool. The part that I am specifically talking about is when the family dog barks at the dinosaur only to retreat to his dog house whimpering. 

What stuck with me about this is I liken it deeply to my situation.  It feels like the world has insurmountable odds facing me and I just retreat to my bedroom which I’m am likening to the doghouse for salvation and shelter. It makes me realize how pitiful I am and my life’s attempts are and how my little bedroom in my own naivety is the only peace I have.  Just like that dog I go back whimpering with my tail between my legs defeated.

224,"(If these seems familiar, I posted something very similar to askreddit) 

Recently, a friend of mine took his own life. He was a vital part of our community and loved every single person he met, and was endlessly kind. Some of my friends and I are trying to work with our school  to start some sort of program to locally revolutionize suicide prevention and support for mentally ill (or anyone struggling) community members. 

I have experienced suicidal ideation very, very frequently and for a very long time. I have my own personal ideas on dissipating astigmatism, support for suicidal people and how we treat the topic of suicide. However, I am only one person and everyone experiences suicidal ideation and mental illness differently in their own way.

I am asking this in order to learn how to support people like me and hopefully prevent something like this from happening. I want to make people (including myself) want to live rather than live in guilt. I want to carry on the legacy of kindness that he left us and help others as he did. 

Tell me what kind of support YOU would want to be shown, and how to move forward from the general mindset surrounding suicide. How can we do better for ourselves and each other?",03Jul2020,1

231,"About a month and a half ago I (22M) had a sudden panic attack out of the blue. I had no direct cause of anxiety or stress but i may have had some stress related issues pile up in the back of my head. After this panic i suffered from severe insomnia and i haven’t felt the same since. I feel on edge all the time sensitive to noises and bright lights. I have constant tingling in my extremities and head. I had waves of panic that came with paraesthesia. My legs feel sore and terribly stiff every day no matter how much I sleep or rest. My eyes feel tired no matter how much i sleep. Occasionally i wake up feeling my left side of my body tingling that slowly goes away. I have terrible fatigue and occasional migraines as well. 

I managed to survive about a month until i couldn’t take it anymore and met with my doctor.  I admitted that i went through intense hypochondria during this time because of my terrible physical symptoms thinking at first i was getting schizophrenia then switched to ALS and then to MS and to brain cancer. I explained to him my symptoms and he examined my blood ,B12, and thyroid. All came back clear and he gave me a GAD diagnosis. He prescribed me antidepressants and buspar for the next few weeks. 

That same day at night i woke up shivering terribly in bed at 4 AM and was so scared. The shivering passed after about 20 minutes. I convinced my parents to take me to the ER and the doctors examined me and determined i had nothing and gave me xanax and pain relievers. I was very frustrated by this outcome so the next day i went back to the ER and asked for a CT scan of my head. They were reluctant because they were convinced i had nothing but they gave me it. The scan came back clear and i was relieved for a bit, until my symptoms persisted. 

About 2 weeks into my antidepressant treatment and I’ve noticed some improvement. The burning paraesthesia with waves of anxiety have stopped and my insomnia has improved. However, i still feel so stiff and fatigued all the time that it feels like i ran a marathon everyday. I fear that this is going to be permanent and chronic and this is my new life. Ive been reading about chronic stress and this seems to check most of its boxes. I have always been a anxious guy terribly so believe me but this is something completely different and lasts the entire day from beginning to end.

It's really dark, something is hurting me i dont know what, but its as if sometimes there is something evil , dark and wicked inside of me trying to guide me into just feeling suicidal. It hurts so fucking much, nothing in this world seems real to me anymore i've reached out for help but i'm still going to have to wait months upon months for CBT.

Ah to be honest i dont know what im asking for, because im just worthless and unworthy. What am i supposed to do? My mom just tells me toughen up, but its not as simple as that...

Now I’m back into “neutral” and I feel like I should be grateful. I’m not sad or exhausted like when I was depressed before. That type of depression is painful. I can manage my everyday activities pretty well.

I guess I’m still kind of depressed but since I’m able to deal with everyday life so much better I feel like that should make me feel better. I don’t think I’d be feeling bad at all about being kinda numb if I hadn’t experienced that happiness recently

Also my other mental illnesses are pretty good right now, I live with some people I like a lot, and I have a remote job that’s a great match for me.

But it’s just not enough. Like I don’t struggle to make it to the next day, but if something happens and it gets hard to make it to the next day again...I don’t feel like now is so great it’ll motivate me to work through that

I see food as calories, Seeing large amounts of food scares me and i don’t like the thought of me being hungry. I eat once a day, and even then i feel like crap for even eating that. I feel bad CONSTANTLY and put myself down about my weight. I was 209, then i dropped to 194 and now i’m 189. I don’t see a difference, despite everyone else saying they do. I feel bad when i end up eating something outside of the one meal a day (which usually only comes up to 400 calories, sometimes). I even had a point in time where i’d not eat for a full day, eat something that’s 200 calories one day, and then skip another day.

I wasn’t sure what to tag this as between needing support or just venting, but any comments or feedback, especially from someone who has this same fear wired into them, would be appreciated greatly.

245,"In 2008 one my best friends died to alcohol poisoning. In 2010 another friend of mine and my cousin both lived at my place we pretty much split everything. All you could hear was video games being played throughout the night. They died in horrible truck accident. They were drunk and the truck flipped multiple times ejecting them. I got the news when the phone rang and I got up and tried to run over and answer but just missed it and had to listen to some girls say they were both dead. 2013 my mother passed away after a long fight with HIV. My grandmother called and left a message she had died. To this day I've always wanted to ask her why she thought that was good idea. 3 months later I was watching a movie, my brother was in the guest room playing a game. He struggled with addiction for many years and had finally cleaned up and it was the happiest time for me to see him finally laughing and hanging out considering at one point I yelled at him to never come back to my home. He walked past the living room and went into the bathroom and was taking a shower. I got up and walked over to the kitchen and grabbed a drink and heard him struggling to breath and knocked on the door asking what was happening and he walked out and said he couldn't catch his breath.  He looked at me one last time before he went with paramedics.  He died of a blood clot that traveled up into his lung. Towards the end of that year my youngest brother was found dead in a hotel from an overdose.  My grandmother would ask me to come to church so I did, I remember someone talking to someone else and saying God has a way of bringing you back to him. That he took them home to bring me back to church. I didn't like that at all but just ignored it out of respect to grandma. I also found out a couple years later I have early stages of congestive heart failure. Then after having my blood taken and the doctor asking me to do 3 tests that took like 3 weeks to finish I was told I may have a benign tumor in my head. Through out all this my good friend who I've always told everyone is my 3rd brother is now struggling with alcohol and drug addiction in this present day. I tried to have a conversation with him and he looked at me and said ""you don't know what I'm going through"" and I suddenly felt this intense anger towards him. I felt like I hated him. I also felt like he's gonna end up like my other two brothers. I said some stuff I'm not gonna repeat. Ever since that happened I feel like anger and sadness is crushing me. I will feel like I'm gonna  be alright when I wake up in the morning and suddenly I am completely depressed and easily angered at the slightest thing. I feel like I need to give my dogs away because I start yelling at them for doing normal things dogs do. I feel like Im gonna lose my mind when they run and hide and wont come to me. Every day I start crying. Almost everyone I grew up with are dead either from substance or alcohol abuse. I never drank or smoked and one day said fuck it and took edibles. Everyone said it was medicine but it all did was make me feel like I couldn't walk across the room to my bed without falling(I have no experience with alcohol or most of the drugs I hear people talk about). I'm obsessed with watching youtube and twitch because it completely distracts me most of the time. If I'm not watching I play fallout or skyrim or some arpg by myself. I've always heard call a hotline or something and talk to someone if you feel trapped. Telling someone face to face or even talking on the phone right now scares the hell out of me. I typed this all out and considered deleting it when I looked at and said to myself I sound like some crazy person making shit up.

Welcome back. Savour the sound of crickets and become absorbed by the stillness of midday. Sunlight hits the white of the paper, creating a startlingly bright canvas for the unfolding of a strange and disquieting tale. Tell me if you can, how many times can a person be born? If your answer was once, that would be a reasonable conclusion to draw. As we grow and change into the people we become, we collect experiences and file them away. Inside us there exists a catalogue of experiences that dictate and influence our responses and beliefs. There is a communication that occurs between the external world and the inner identity we have constructed across a lifetime. Without that communication what we are would cease to be because we are the sum of our experiences at a core level. What if that person on the most intimate level becomes interrupted? Fractured even? Have you ever looked into a mirror and in all sincerity responded with the question ""who is that?"" There exists a sense of unsafety and racing pulse a palatable discomfort in one's own skin. If so perhaps you have become fractured. When something severe happens it ultimately disturbs a person. There are a number of tragic experiences that can result in a fractured state of being. Someone that can never entirely become recovered. The world can leave an inner self in a proverbial corner, tape across the mouth stunned into silence. A quiet nod to you if you also are aqquainted with this silence. My inner person has been held for ransom on multiple occasions. In the beginning I was aware of myself, and my physical body. Two entities facing an unpredictable world when the unimaginable overwhelmed us and the fracture began. To survive we construct other ""self's"". Unable to identify the voice of the first, concentration and energy is utilized on the development of a new person. A new person with a little less curiosity and slightly elevated levels of caution for the outside world is formed. For the outside world is uncompromising and requires constant adaption. To illustrate there is the sound of hustle and bustle outside my room. This room is certainly not home like nor does it suggest itself to be. It is a hospital room and personally, it is the place where my every fear comes to congregate. There is shuffling footsteps in the halls and iridescent lighting. The misery and anticipation is thick and palatable in the air, I try not to be swept up in it. outside the breeze is cool the bushes are home to misplaced possums and lizards the sounds of traffic often interrupting the silence. I notice I can't swallow there is a lump in my throat too large and an ache in the depths of my gut beckoning me to go in search of a cigarette despite having given up. In this place there is no thought of restraint, or is abstinence applauded. This is a place of acute turmoil a last stop for survival and a resting place for broken dreams. Optimism here seems delusional and people would sell their very soul in exchange for some relief. I'm summoned into the treatment room and brace myself in disbelief for what is about to unfold. I lie down on a starched white rigid bed as if readying myself for an execution which in some ways is not entirely innacurate. For me, a further fraction is about to take place another split in the self. A recalibration, rewiring and resetting is occuring, and I feel reborn into the world to start from scratch. Through induced seizure I am reformed and prepared for release. But as a patchy canvas I have lost context texture and storage. like a wiped computer I am ready to be reloaded and filled, but never with exactly the same content. I am alone but surrounded by glitching data some times during the neural shuffle, memories are brought forward to re experience. I feel I have lived a strange life with merging identities that together create the sum of a fully formed person. A hub of colorful fear and dysfunction full of secrets. Inbuilt is a permanent caution toward the world which only the fractured will ever have to know. ",03Jul2020,3
250,"He had an extremely difficult upbringing with his mom getting severe Parkinson's disease and paralyzed when he was 15. His dad became a depressed alcoholic, I think he was sexually abused as well when he was very young by his aunt... 

We grew up in complete and constant terror throughout my childhood, I realized later in adulthood that he had a wide range of mental disorders which manifested in rage, constant anger, paranoia and the list keeps going. 

My childhood was full of severe emotional abuse, constant stress and fear. 

Later in life when I was 22 just graduated from college he got lung cancer (he chimney smoked for decades, quit five years before he got cancer) anyways, god decided not to take him yet, but make him handicapped (ataxia) now, 11 years later, he's still alive, 10× more abusive, 10x more manipulative.

I've realized now, that I was conditioned to be completely obedient and do whatever he says. He had controlled my entire life, and had sabotaged every single attempt I made at achieving independence and making a life for myself. He ruined my career with his cunning manipulation, ruined my emotional life and relationships with women. Interfered in every corner of my life.

If it weren't for my mother, his fulltime caregiver I don't know what I would do... he abuses her constantly and she literally collects his piss whenever he needs to go for the last 10 years.

I'm so damn tired of this, so tired of living because of him.

You hear stories of good people getting cancer and dying soon after, devastating everyone around them. But you never hear of people who's illness exacerbates everything that is evil and destructive about them and ruines the life of everyone around them intentionally and they just wouldn't die, for 11 years, to have the most aggressive form of lung cancer, and to survive it solely for the purpose of destroying everyone around you.

261,"(Question at the bottom, this just provides context)

I’m fifteen, I live with both of my parents and everything is so wrong. It’s not right to say they’re bad parents, because I couldn’t do that to them. They call me names, they’ve physically fought with me, they shout, they argue with eachother, but most importantly they’re hard to talk to about anything with. Despite being lucky enough to be blessed with having both my parents, it feels like I may as well have none. 

The only time I feel like they cared is when I was sick, I had a really bad case of pneumonia and it was the only time I ever felt like they cared at all about me. 

So I tried to get ill again. 

It sounds so horrible looking back at it, and I wish I didn’t. I had the mindset of “if I get ill they’ll notice again” and part of me still thinks that way. I’m disgusted with the mindset and I’m trying to get past it. 

I’ve done so many stupid things in pursuit of one of these good adult figures in my life, like actually message older people who aren’t my parents to try get some kind of relationship. Nearly all of which have turned out to be *bad* people and try coerce me to do *stuff*. I was really naive looking back at it and I’m glad I caught myself before I did anything I’d regret forever. 

I can’t put into words how badly I just wanted someone to talk to, someone who was just mature and  older, is it weird? I didn’t want *that* kind of relationship or anything weird, just an adult figure in my life I could rely on. I dunno, maybe I’m just attention seeking and there’s nothing more too it. It just makes me sad when I see all of my friends with their families.

I’ve become close with some teachers, I wouldn’t tell them anything like this though. Just have a laugh with them. That’s the extent of good adult relationships I have.

265,"If you look at my previous history, I don't give a lot of replies. Don't hate me for it. But i would like some advice if I could get some.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought this has only been for the last couple of years but the more and more I've thought about it I actually cant remember when it started. I always got made fun of in middle school. Just everyday. For being poor, how I dressed, for how I acted( My grandma raised me and kinda sheltered me cause she was terrified of the outside world pretty much). Made a few friends in High School and somehow even had a girlfriend for 4 years. She didnt really know me when we started dating and i really dont think she would have if she had gotten to know me first. Still got made fun of but it was more tolerable when I had people who actually seemed like they cared for me. 

Growing up I was always told by my family and teachers how I was really smart and was gonna go somewhere in life. Don't think I let that get to my head but I might have. Passed every grade with A's and B's. Graduated with a scholarship to a local college near my town. Had pell grant too so I was getting a lot of money back every semester because my scholarship nearly paid for everything. Could have literally bought land and small home or trailer with how much i would have gotten back by the end of  my college. And a degree I might could get a decent job at and work my way up. 

When I started college was about halfway or more through my relationship with my gf. I really think this is when things started to go downhill. I started making mistakes left and right. I wrecked my gf's car when she didn't know i was driving it. I offered to change the title of my car over into her name but she said she didnt want me to. We were staying at her parents at the time. We had to move out because of  me so we got a trailer. I didnt have a job for a while deciding to not save my pell grant money and instead use it to live while I went to college. Ended up spending most of it on junk. Missed paying bills constantly. Started struggling in college and started to not go more and more frequently. A friend who had been living in a bad situation started living with us. My idea. Thought I was being a nice guy. Made bad decision after bad decision. Dude has people over at my house constantly and my gf seems like she's flirting with all of them and him everyday. Weird shit starts happening. She ends up getting pregnant and wants an abortion instantly. I tell her no please we can do this. But I def obviously didn't know how to be an adult so no i didn't have that. She ended up leaving and going back to her parents and would occasionally come by to fuck until eventually she started dating someone and told me she was only coming by cause she was desperate for sex. Dude stayed for about a month or two longer and kept promising to get a job while I got one and worked on trying to pay my bills and fix shit so I could get her back. He eventually dipped when he got a girlfriend and got a job so he could live with her. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I say I tried to fix shit but I was so depressed and lonely (literal first time just being absolutely alone in life). I started drinking heavily, took pills, etc. anything to drown out the feels. I still worked constantly through all the depression. Even tried to help other people with their problems. Was going to the hospital and checkups with  my ex so I could see what was going on with our child. Was in the operating room when he was born. Very premature. I tried to go up there to the hospital( a 2 and half hour drive there and same back) every weekend. I had started having paranoia towards the dude and my gf and our ""friends"" a couple months before the pregnancy had even been known about. After he was born I started hearing stuff from lots of different people about how the kid wasn't mine. People would laugh at me when they told me. The dude who I let live with me for free for months and who I was still trying to be friends with for some reason would smile and smirk in front of me when people would talk about the kid not being mine. Two people who he was good friends with told me how he bragged about fucking her. I was still trying to go see the kid who now lived with her at her parents house. But at this point I had no faith he was mine. They still wanted me to come over and watch him all the time though. Thinking back on it now, my ex had gotten a boyfriend as soon as she left the hospital. It tore me up, literally fucked me up seeing her with him every time I went over there. It was a guy she had worked with and literally everyone knew he was on some bad drugs. She started acting sketchy I guess trying to act out or something. I don't really know. But I think I was pretty much a glorified babysitter while she went out with him. Her parents didn't watch the kid alot. 

At this time I had basically let everything in my trailer go. Rent, water, power were months behind. My water had been cut off and there was a literal pile of shit in both of my toilets. Would try to get water from somewhere to flush the toilet but for the most part just didn't care.  I got kicked out and I had to start living at my grandma's old home by myself or with my dad who has always made me feel like a child just like I don't know anything at all. I was still working at the time and was actually paying the bills at my grandmas for a little while. My gf broke up with her boyfriend and sometimes I would stay the night at her parents to help watch the kid and she would let me fuck her. Let is a big word. She always seemed disinterested and would constantly tell me how her dad would kill me if he found out. Like it was a privilege getting to have sex with her. At this point I had no faith that the kid was mine but I still loved her and wanted to be with her which wasn't happening. We ended up getting in a fight and I left her parents and never went back over. Quit my job and stopped paying my bills. Started doing drugs with my dad(who has always seen me as a child and will not acknowledge me as a man). Everything I did in my dads eyes before I gave up like back in highschool and going to that college was a mistake. Doing drugs with my dad was a bad idea cause he could get a lot of different shit. Went down a long spiral that eventually ended up with me getting arrested. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even waiting the year and a half for my trial I just didn't care. I kept doing drugs and just being general trash. Stole from a lot of my family  so I could get spice, pills, just whatever. The drugs never helped though. Obviously. during this whole span of i think 3-4 years(Beginning mildly in my trailer after my gf had left and progressing to more intense levels as time went by), I suffered from constant panic attacks(Short breath, tight chest, feeling like everything was closing in on me, tingling feeling all over my body), extreme paranoia, anxiety and social anxiety. I didn't even think or worry about my trial until a month before hand. I wasn't clean when I went to trial and I got put on a drug screening program along with probation. But somehow my lawyer got it to where I wouldn't have to drug test until I was clean. I dont know how I didn't end up going to prison. But I got clean. Got a job met a roommate who I thought was pretty cool and we got a place together. Made a couple of friends at that job. Thought everything was going great. Lived with my roommate and his on and off gf for 4 years. Turns out he hated life just as much as I did. And took it out on me every time he got the chance calling me names, telling me I was a weird little man. All kinds of shit. He was an awful drunk. But I had nowhere else to go. All my problems started getting worse again and I started hating working. Lost all of my friends to paranoia and other bullshit. Had let some dude I felt sorry for live with us and of course he fucked me over as hard as he could too. I left that job and got a new one for six months left that job and got a new one and now I want to leave this job because of my paranoia and anxiety. I feel awful every time I step in the building I don't talk to people a whole lot now because I'm literally scared to trust anyone. When I do talk I can barely make a jumbled sentence before I just walk away. I get made fun of a lot now or else my mind tells me that I am. IDK. People stare at me and when I look at them they avert their eyes like they are scared to make eye contact. I think they literally think I'm a loaded gun and I might come firing the place up at any time. I don't even really trust the two friends I have. I actually believe they make fun of me a lot. 

 I think people see me as a bitch now that they can manipulate. And they can because I'm gullible and just want anyone to want to be around me. But when i'm around people I can't stop feeling anxious and paranoid. I only truly have any kind of happiness now when I'm alone. and I hate that more than anything. I just want someone to care about me. Genuinely. But I'm like a side piece in every interaction. My roommate now( I really don't know how to afford to live by myself) acts likes he's my best friend but at the same time acts like I'm mentally challenged and he's my special mentor. I don't see my family a lot now days and they don't ever contact me. I have 2 ""friend's"" who I can barely trust. And that's it. I'm miserable, lonely, anxious in every situation, paranoid, and I just feel dead inside. I cried a lot when this first started but it slowly stopped and now i just don't feel like crying either. I hate my life and constantly think about suicide as the only option that's really left. I'm 28 years old and I'm not gonna let this be the rest of my life. its been around 6-7 years now and this is just fucking insane. It's like everything about me is just fundamentally broken. I work and pay my bills so i can survive. But I'm literally like a child in a mans body. It's like unconsciously my mind tells me that everyone in the world whose considered an adult(be it younger or older than me) is a lot more mature and adult like than I am. I do adult shit everyday but I can't make myself feel like an adult. I barely feel like a human being. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's all i can think of for now. There is a whole lot more but those are definitely some of the most major things I can think of. I'm sorry if things seem jumbled or incoherent. I've been awake for over a day now and haven't been able to sleep. I'm not looking for pity or for cries. I just want some actual good advice. 

Am I a man child? Some giant fucking baby who just cant grow up? Do I have a mental disorder? Autism or just mental illness? Am I a lost cause? Should I try and seek help(I have before but to know avail). 

One last thing I want to mention is that when my dad moved into my grandmas old house with me, he had went through almost the same identical situation. My step mom cheated on him with his ""best friend"". They had been together for about a decade and after she did that he just threw everything in his life away. Before he had worked all the time had cars constantly, boats, etc. was always buying and trading stuff. To this day he lives in shop that almost rotted and collapsed outside my grandma's. He refuses to work or to do anything at all to get back to a normal spot in society. He just doesn't care anymore. The only difference between us is that I went back and tried to at least partially fix my life. But I'm scared I could just mentally collapse and fuck everything up all over again. I can't end up like my dad. I have to either fix it now or just finally realize its time to give up on life. I won't be homeless again.

269,"Here's a little background: turned 24 years old last week and have been dealing with what I believe is depression and anxiety for half of my life (I think I've been diagnosed with depression once but I'll explain). 

I don't think therapy will ever work for me, and at this point I really wish it would because I'm in need of support. But that isn't the point; I want to explain why I think therapy won't work for me and have anyone else's input or advice. 

Long story short, when I was 17, my older sister found out that I was cutting myself and forced my dad to take me to see someone. 
This was the first time I saw a psychologist. I did the initial session of getting to know each other. I liked her, and I was relieved to have someone to talk to. I looked forward to our next session in two weeks. That session finally comes, and as soon as I sit in her office, she tells me that I would be better off in group therapy. For the sake of keeping this post as short as possible, I won't list the reasons why I believed I would not benefit from group therapy without any one-on-one beforehand. She doesn't listen -- she gets my dad and the group therapist involved while I'm standing in the hallway trying to leave. Eventually my dad says he won't force me to do group therapy and we leave. I don't attend group therapy and never see that therapist again. 

Now, the second person I saw was a psychiatrist. It was only a couple weeks after seeing the therapist. I tell the psychiatrist the issues I was having; I put a lot of emphasis on my anxiety because I was struggling to leave my house without vomiting or being unable to speak to strangers. She told me she believed I was depressed and wanted to prescribe anti-depressants. However, the type she wanted to prescribe worsened anxiety but prevented weight gain. I never mentioned issues with my weight, and I stressed how upset I was over my anxiety, so I was confused and sad that she didn't seem to listen to me. I decided against taking the medication because I was scared about the side effects, and I never saw the psychitrist again. 

Lastly, when I was an adult, I decided to try an online service. I filled out questionares and applications for all the reccomended online therapy sites, and each one sent an email back saying I was not the proper candidate for them. 

I have no idea what's wrong with me. I feel like I'm too much even for people I'd pay to listen and help me. It's so hard finding a therapist, and while I think I really need help, I already know it wouldn't work because of my past experiences. I just feel very stuck and like I have no hope. 
Has anyone else ever been through this? Were you ever able to find a therapist? Or did you do other self care type stuff to make yourself feel better? Any advice would be nice. Thank-you.",03Jul2020,2
