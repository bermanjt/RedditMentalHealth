0,"Does anyone else with social anxiety experience this? I’m so tired of it. I’ll be stressed out about something and I’ll cause my body to do something I cannot hide, because that’s fun... not. It used to be sweating above my top lip (gross) even when it wasn’t hot, or looking in inappropriate places, now it’s facial twitches. I’m sure there’s been others.

I say making it happen because the thoughts in my head actually make it happen. I think “wouldn’t it be mortifying if...” and no amount of CBT can stop it. Eventually they stop but something else replaces it. It all revolves around interacting with people. I spend so much time trying to stop it happening I cannot live in the moment. Anyone?",09Jan2020,1

3,"This is my first post here and sorry for the bad formatting...
Now on to my story

Ever since I was young I have always daydream to escape from reality,sometimes I used to do it for hours. I remember that daydreams would always be revolving around my interest. For instance I was always into videogames such as Minecraft,fnaf,undertale and roblox. And videogames have always beeny primary interest.sometimes to the point we're that's all I think about all day. I don't play them or anything,I just happened to really like them for some reason.
So everyday I would make scenarios in my head for hours to the point I forget about reality. 

I also here voices in my head,and that's been a problem ever since I was ten. At first they weren't that bad, most of the voices I heard before were really positive.Now the voices are really negative for some reason.

I also have an intrusive thought problem were I have thoughts that come right outta the blues and Annoy me for hours. I had this problem ever since I was 7 or 8",09Jan2020,1

I can't tell my parents about any of this because they still treat me like I'm a child. I'm turning 18 this year, but they're still gonna treat my mental state like it's something I'm making up or that it's just hormones. It's not, and I know it.

7,"Hi! This is my first Reddit post!

I am a 19 yo male from Canada, and I am seeking advice on how to feel better psychologically.
 
 I suffer from rapid mood changes, obsessive thoughts (mainly about my hair and physique), and intrusive thoughts. I've sometimes felt dissociation and had panic attacks. I'm too hard on myself and sometimes feel like life holds little value.

 I am currently on prescribed Risperdal (0.5- 1 mg/ day.)My psychologist says I had a schizoaffective way of functionning. She helps me, and my parents and friends also support me in these hard times. 

I've started a positivity journal where I write things I like about myself. I occasionally train at the gym and want to try meditating. 

I hope this post isn't all too confusing! But bottom line is, I wonder what other things and techniques I could do and use to battle my illness head on, and become a happier person.

What helped you in your fight against mental illness? Any advice is welcome.",09Jan2020,1
8,"He has had an ingoing issue of staying up very late and not being able to get up in time for school. He started to develop an automatic response to being woken up. The issue I am noticing now is that he is becoming hostile toward our mother. She has taken him to a few doctors to try to identify the issue and he is constantly denying the doctors' advice. Now he is saying that the issue isn't some sleep disorder, but there is some underlying mental issue. He says that the issue is our mother because by coming into his room to wake him up, that prevents him from doing so. Every time we try to help him he deflects and claims we don't understand, when it is obvious he is unintentionally deluding himself in order to protect his habits. 

He seems to have given up on reality, he is more invested in his online friends than his real ones, and he has no motivation to graduate. My mother's observation is that he seems to feel blamed for his problems and even positivity seems hostile.

I am really concerned because at this rate he will likely drop out and become a hikikomori. I guess I'm looking for guidance. Where should I look for answers?",09Jan2020,1
9,"Hi, I'm a 12th Grade Senior High School in the Philippines   
I don't really know if i have such mental health issues since  
well I've never been diagnosed or I don't know if i'm just being overreacting to the things happening to me but well here I am approaching Reddit.  


So character background is your guy here is a gamer, a band bassist and a mediocre student  
the gaming part came to me as a stress reliever but the more stress i take, the more hours i put into gaming I then became a semi professional player for my game (League Of Legends Masters rank #\~1,200 out of 1.2 Million players). The band part came when an school event (namely battle of the bands) got announced, and as a person with musical background I took the initiative of forming a band (Now is well known on our area)  and we take local gigs. Last part is the school   
welp my school is notoriously known for it's academic skill just the name of the school would mean fear for the other schools here our city, and yes I am in this school   
but only as a mediocre student   
my grades go high as 94 but as low as 75  


Now this is where the problem starts  
As I write this rant, I am currently cutting classes and I'm aware of the dangers of it  
but I have the excuse of not going because I don't feel well (nosebleed yesterday, woke up with low blood pressure today and i'm very late so I just went to review my exams for today and will go home later)   
so now i am facing academic stress, I have all my requirements in the house just stacked upon one another but i'm just too embarrassed to pass them because i'm scared of being looked at the faculty by the other teachers and I am mostly known for that behavior and being late  
I am the worst student of the best school, I'm only known because my ex was famous because everyone was intimidated by her and I had the audacity to make a move but... we broke up due to me being useless and having a depressive episode that time when she needed me... so i don't blame her, plus she's having fun with her new boyfriend (5 months after)... all i'm known for the school for Is my big brain towards philosophy and social structures.. but due to the teacher in philosophy (not having a degree in philosophy) i kinda failed that class even though i was good at philosophizing, oh and also for being in a band. I game because it's the only thing that gives me thrill and i'm sorry for the word usage but ""The Fire Of Passion"", at Saturday i'll be going to the tryouts of an E-Sports team.  


(here comes the mindset)  
I know I've always been useless but it never hit me that much since it was just a fact and I believed it, most of my friends say i'm not   
but how can they say that?  
I'm not an honors student and I always f\*ck up things up.  
the worse part is that I know i'm wrong   
I know that I'm bad   
but I can't do anything to change..  
And it's been like that for 4 years now..  
I'm helpless and useless. just like an ant falling down the sink  


i just don't know anymore  
yes I've of suicide  
i did several times  
and I also thought of selling my organs to the black market to give my family the financial aid they can get.  
I mean it's logical right?  
but when they knew what was on my mind they all cried.  
I can never open up again.  
I'm a crazy person or a psychopath if I go to mental health departments. Welcome to The Philippines.  
And when me and my ex broke up I became an alcoholic... every Friday every week.. for a month or two..  


how i'm still here   
while most people do the iconic slashing in the wrist of self-harm..  
I just wake up at the midnight and listen to the inner voices in me on how useless i am and how many people I've Disappointed and it literally burns and aches my chest..  


so no one can see my pain..  
I just laugh and send/make/share memes and offer the helping hand because I don't want people to experience the same pain as me.  


But..  
How can I help.  
when I can't even help myself..

12,"Pretty much sums it all up. But a little information...for my personal life, my wife and mother are disabled, my dad is fighting off (and beating) cancer, but with myself being the most able-bodied male available to my family, I feel I have this obligation to fix everything. Because I'm a complete idiot, myself and the wife have a decent amount of debt built up we can never seem to catch up with, though we aren't penniless.

So, there's that. I won't just lay everything out here, but I end up feeling very much overwhelmed, smothered even. There are days when I can be in a good mood, but most of my days unusually in some sort of funk or another, like feeling so worn down I can barely even work up the energy to warm up food in the microwave for myself. Or I become unreasonably angry and almost violent. This...isn't my norm, and when I get in these moods, I behave very bnb abnormally, seriously considering if even getting up out of bed or off the couch is worth it or becoming completely hateful towards people I love.

Enough rambling, I suppose I'm simply confused, and maybe a little scared about the situation. Should I seek psychological help, or am I just being immature and not handling things properly? Do I just need to man up and figure out how to fix it myself?

TL;DR, Feel like I'm losing my mind, going from depressed to full-on rage. Fund a psychologist of some kind or just work it out?",09Jan2020,1
13,"I’m a student who has recently come home for the Christmas holiday. My mother has approached me after a couple of weeks and said she thinks I’m depressed again. For some background context, I currently live a few hundred miles away and whilst away have had a few tears phone calls to my mother due to being very stressed about a future living arrangement that had fallen through, jeopardising my ability to continue with my studies. Admittedly I completely panicked and predicted that I’d have to drop out despite having plenty of time to find alternate arrangements. My grandmother who I’d visited also brought up to my mother that she was worried as I’d not worn makeup and had lost a lot of weight. I do always wear makeup as routine mostly because I’d gotten into the habit when working in a job which required you to look professional and well groomed. I’d brought up during the visit that I’d probably gained weight due to snacking whilst working on assignments. We weighed me and found out I’d actually lost weight. I put this down to having to walk a lot more and that I’d had a cold recently and had therefore been eating soups more than solids. 
Whilst at home I have also been very ill with a bug that the rest of the family has also had which has stopped us all from eating due to nausea. My mother has said she’s worried that I’m not eating and I seem to be feeling down, e.g. not visited any friends whilst home, and asked if I’d developed an eating disorder whilst studying. To be honest, I have been attempting to eat but always once the food is made feel myself unable to eat due to feeling full or like I’m going to be sick. This has previously been an issue when I had depression before. It’s worth pointing out I don’t struggle with body image but one of my dorm mates does have an eating disorder which has certainly impacted me somewhat as they will criticise the food we all eat and makes comments about weight. I understand they are unwell and don’t take this to heart and don’t think I have changed my eating habits at all. As for visiting friends, to be honest I’ve needed family time and some time alone to recharge my battery after living on campus for so long so the reprieve from social interaction has been nice and I have still kept in touch with friends by phone calls and such. 
I have been fighting regularly with my brother whilst home and it’s been difficult to say the least as he often will make fun of me (which I can handle to an extent) but doesn’t know when to stop and doesn’t stop when asked. In turn I’ll admit that if he doesn’t listen to me when I say stop I can say some quite viscous things, mostly about how he is lazy and hasn’t left home yet despite being twenty five. As adults I’ll admit it’s childish but we are very different people and struggle to remain civil. During two weeks I have been reduced to tears three times due to arguing with him. My mother thinks that I am overly emotional at the moment from being depressed as she finds my brother easy to get along with. I have spoken to her and said that actually I’m emotional because I find my brother to be unbearable as the only time we interact is when he’s belittling me. Yesterday we had a big fight over him cancelling plans with me. Essentially he’d asked me to go with him to a see a film we both like and I’d held off seeing it till he could get an evening free. It then came about yesterday that he’d have a free evening today so I’d said let’s make an arrangement to see the film today. He told me he’d maybe go see it with me but that it was guaranteed as he might have better plans come up like going to the pub with someone. I’d said it’s a Wednesday night in January, it was unlikely he’d get plans and to just make plans with me now and not cancel, easy peasy. He then said that he was doing me a favour going to see it with me despite me having previously turned down plans with friends to see it as he’d asked me to see it with him. To be honest it felt like a kick in the teeth and was ultimately the straw that broke the camels back as it demonstrated to me that he doesn’t value spending time with me and, coupled with the ridiculing of me, he doesn’t respect me as a person. My mother snapped over the arguing and said I was being overly emotional as I’d cried again and that she was making me an appointment to go back on antidepressants.
I don’t think I’m depressed again. Or at least I didn’t but now I’m not sure because I don’t usually cry but have been crying lots due to the arguments. My appetite has gone but I’ve put it down to being poorly and I’ve been less social than usual because of this also. But then I was losing weight before I was ill also and I’m wondering if I’ve not actually been eating because I keep thinking about throwing food away after meals and whether or not I actually ate anything. I’m now questioning my behaviour because I have been feeling down lately but I thought it was because of outside stressors but I’m those around me are saying it’s me. I can’t tell if my feelings are justified and I need an outside opinion.",09Jan2020,1
14,"Her family does not know just how deep her depression/anxiety goes, and she refuses to tell them due to fear of rejection (they've played it off as it ""all being in her head"" before, are not mental health advocates). Ever since I've known her she's been down, but these last sixth months have been the worst I've ever witnessed-- she talks about suicide at least once a week. I'm the only person she talks to about this stuff and until now I've been able to help, but now I'm getting really freaked out. She's a student and says she doesn't have time to see a therapist, and is also too scared to go alone (I've offered to go with her) and believes that she is too far gone to be helped (even though shes never even tried therapy of any kind). I don't know what to do anymore, and I feel like if she kills herself it will be my fault for not doing enough. I don't think she's a risk to herself at this exact moment (I would have called 911 if I thought that), but I feel like she could get to that point soon. I feel like if I don't answer her texts immediately and talk her down, she will do something drastic-- which is becoming something of a problem because I have my own life/mental health to take care of too (I know that sounds selfish and I feel horrible about it, but her issues take up hours of my day/night). I love her and I don't want anything bad to happen to her, but I know we can't keep this up for much longer. What can I do??

16,"So about me, I try my hardest and very desperately too to become a great writer because I love books and since I was little it was the only thing I was really passionate about.

I didn't start writing until I was 14 and before that all I did was make comics surrounded in a very chaoitic home life with parents constantly fighting and verbally abusing me. I was never really good at school, daydreamed too much and instead of socialising I read in the hallways. But somehow I feel like it never really helped me, It's like there's a blockage in my brain that prevents me to absorb information and it's veryyyy strenuous for me to think logically.

My mind feels cloudy and foggy all day, and despite me attempting to study the books i like in detail and writing 2k words a day and looking up dictionaries and all that I don't feel any smarter. I still feel like the 14 year old who can barely put together two sentences that make sense and I'm 18 now. I see those kids on wattpad writing great stories with good grammar and storylines and they're only 16 and I wonder how that's possible. Do you think that could correlate to me having BPD?

It's really frustrating because writing is the only thing I want out of life, forget love, forget family, forget money, forget happiness even, I just want to write stories and write more but no matter how hard I try it's like i'm not improving at all. I wrote 2 books so far and I'm not happy with them, they read to me like a child wrote them. I mainly read classics and other books that are harder to read in hopes that it will make something in my brain click and make me a better writer but everything I type or say sounds disorganised and random. I just want to be wonderful and good like all those writers I read but I'm not even close to it and it breaks my heart.

Does anyone have tips to become smarter without having to take any courses? Something I can do independently? I'm not the best when it comes to reaching out for help so any such advice can just as well be left unsaid because I will not take it.",09Jan2020,1
17,"I am a 20 year old male student and I have been struggling a lot with my mental health for a really long time (I am not solely talking about stress because of my studies etc. I do have this but it is the ""smallest problem I have""). Also this account is made because others could recognize me otherwise. Please understand that English is not my first language.

So my mental health was already declining for a long time but stuff is finally getting to me. I don't know if this is the right place to post this and this might also be disturbing for some of you. (Or maybe just to me)

First I like to begin with my childhood. Nothing terrible ever happened to me but I was quick to understand most stuff (and pretty naive when it came to reality in some subjects).   
When I was about 6-7 years old I firstly got sleep-paralysis (I never got diagnosed for some stuff in this post. It is very hard for me to talk about with relatives etc. but if they knew I went to a doctor etc. things would escalate very badly (they kind of know probably but they are ignorant when subjects like that come up)

Sorry for the interruption, so when I was 6-7 I first got it. It stayed a few months (definitely more than 1.5 years). They went away but always came back. I dreamed of seeing myself hanged (like gallops) by my own intestines, eaten alive whilst burning alive, drowning (more like waterboarding), getting operated on without proper medication or painkillers. The list goes on and on but these are the least disturbing in my opinion. Also before ""dreaming"" (was sometimes half awake and saw stuff in my room) these things I had some traumatic events before.

So I would lay completely stiff on my bed limbs spread and my fingers ""clawed"" into my mattress. I got  cold-sweat (warm and cold at the same time), felt my blood flow (I even heard it sometimes, very weird stuff). With the latter I also felt and heard my heartbeat even in my skull which seemed to expand when the pulse repeated itself. My eyes spread wide and I don't blink for a long time (probably longer in my experience than the time which went by in reality). My room also came alive (changing shapes etc.) and I saw ""that thing"" (It is pretty obvious I have a trauma about ""this thing"" but it is also very difficult to describe). I got an enormous amounts of cramps but somehow managed to not move just out of pure fear. Also I didn't dare to open my mouth (as if it was sewed tight) and only breath with short breaths through my nose. Sometimes this happened multiple times per night. It mostly stopped when I passed out.

If this sounds like something from the exorcist it just might be I only twice vomited over myself during this. I only was able to get help from my mother once. And she also became traumatized by my ""possessed pose"" I was in. She especially remembers my eyes. Sorry about this long section but I also want to vent a bit. My declining mentality makes me scared to go asleep (It's 2 am here). Also I hear voices and see stuff that isn't there for a long time now.

I also do not easily (if at all) make close relationships with people. I worry a lot about them if I do (more than about myself). My further career went good (not perfect but never had major issues) until I got to college. (Went pretty decent but the college was very bad with people (only 2 or 3 people I know from there still study there, the rest mostly left)). I did change too and found a better place. But my mental problems make it unable to even think clear let alone study etc.

Now as I already said my mental health is rapidly declining. I think I probably have some immunodeficiency. I feel my nerves in my head ""move"", when it is cold my back feels like spiting and hurts like hell. Also I have a big pain-limit when it comes to my inside. I once walked around with something that should have been a direct trip to the emergency-room for more than 1 day. When the doctor saw it (surely didn't expect it) he immediately send me to the operation-room and couldn't believe I felt no pain. Also I am temporarily infertile which is probably also a consequence of being born too soon. (Might be fixed by yet another operation). I don't feel like having kids and I won't be a good father. (Hell I have problems taking care of myself let alone children)

Enough about the physical stuff. Mentally I feel like a mess. I feel almost no enjoyment anymore, have mood-switches, I don't recognize myself and feel like something took over my head (""that thing"" maybe?). Hell I don't recognize myself in the mirror if I look into one at all (other nightmares where my reflection strangled me or I got stabbed/impaled by an insane amount of glass-shards made me aware of mirrors). Maybe it is also self-shame and guilt. A lot of my close friends say that I need more self-esteem and to not feel guilty (goes kind of hand in hand with the worrying). I oppressed the shit out of things and they never saw me angry (in a decent anger) or cry. Now I don't even feel like ""myself"" or remember what I used to feel like.

For anyone here wondering if I am addicted to alcohol etc. The answer is no. I had 2-3 months where it was especially hard where I drank more than usual but I still drink way less that the average student to this day.

For the ones wondering if I harm myself the answer is regrettably yes. I harm myself with boiling water (the damp not the liquid) by letting it condensate on my skin. (Mostly hands from a hot cup)  
It probably started when I began to feel empty and began to take hotter baths and showers to feel warmth again (to this day my only source of warmth). I shower at a minimum of 42°C if not higher. This method also leaves no scars/wounds but makes me feel something.

For the ones wondering if I consider suicide the answer would be I don't know. But that probably means yes. I have struggled with the thought for years. However regrettably someone close to me did it before me. (I won't go in further detail it gets darker and darker the more you know and whilst it is a huge deal to me I feel not like discussing this (might be wrong but I can't handle this)) That is why I am probably here. If that person didn't do it I would definitely have done it myself. (Sounds bad I know but it is the harsh truth). I still think about it all the time. Even when I don't I only need to see any object and I begin to think how I could stab/crush/... myself with it. I am someone who has ""experience"" from both sides (my god I hate how I worded that). I do not go on balconies and roofs anymore since that doesn't help me right now. Also please don't recommend r/SuicideWatch to me. I am familiar with the subreddit (on another account). I did help (only a handful) of people there but I can't help myself. (Pretty ironic but true). Also I have some things I like to take care of before I make my final decision.

Btw I do not in any situation hurt anyone else. I am not a danger to others but I am to myself. I literally feel myself mentally die constantly in my brain. (Don't know how to explain it)

I do feel myself brake and oppressing doesn't seem to keep it controlled anymore. I can go on for a bit longer but I can literally feel it tearing me apart.

Well I probably let things out since you can't really type it all but I tried. I am sorry it became this long and all over the place with the shifting back and forth (I know my style is kind of hard to follow).   
Also sorry if the NSFW tag wasn't needed but yeah. I still have no idea if this is the right place to post this tbh.

I do not expect an answer to be honest but at least it's out here now. I am going to try and ""sleep"" now (just blank darkness and waking up tired). Please help some other people out there too.",09Jan2020,1

Because of this, i found myself around people and in situations that were not very safe. About a year ago i finally recognized how unhealthy my thoughts and actions were, and i was able to hold myself accountable for the way i had been living. For the past year i have been working hard on bettering myself. I have quit binge drinking, and am in the process of finishing up my last year of university. Although i do feel a lot better about myself , i still struggle with feelings  of shame and guilt with regards to  my past. Does any one have any advice that they can give that may help me forgive myself, and move on? 
Thanks in advance",09Jan2020,1

22,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I have two friends from my previous place of work. Both friends have admitted to being rather checked out at work over the past few months, but they still continued to get stuff done. One friend, call him G, has been trying to turn his side hustle into a full time gig, so he's been especially checked out. I know it's not going all that great because he had to borrow some money from me a couple weeks ago. He also has a family to support: wife, two young kids, and his aging mother. He is the sole breadwinner.

I hung out with G on Friday. We sat and talked and drank for hours, literally until 1 in the morning, having a great time. Monday we texted for a little bit. We made plans to hang out this coming Friday. All seemed fine.

Then yesterday, our other friend (call him N) told me G hadn't been at work all day, and he couldn't get ahold of him. No one from their team could. So I texted him. No response. After work, N called me. Said he'd just stopped by G's apartment, and he was there with his wife and two kids, and all seemed fine, but he didn't really pry all that much.

Then today, N reports that G has resigned, effective immediately. Again, sole breadwinner for a family of 5. Now I'm kinda freaking out. So I text him again. ""Hey man seriously are you doing okay?"" No response, so I follow up with ""I'm coming to your place tonight. That cool?"" Finally get a response. ""I'm fine. Don't need to come here. I am good though."" I reply ""For real though man. Worried about you."" He insists he's okay, so I ask him about meeting up Friday, and he says No. I tell him he's really making me anxious, to which he says ""don't be."" I say ""an explanation of what's going on would put me more at ease,"" and he says ""Wish I had one. It's an excuse. No reasons. Scares the shit out of me. Sorry bro.""

A few minutes ago, N calls me to tell me he stopped at G's apartment once again on the pretense of getting some work stuff. Said he was once again there with his wife and kids, and once again they all looked perfectly normal.

But I'm still very concerned for the guy. A perfectly normal person doesn't quit their job on a whim with a family to support, and then have no explanation as to why, even for his closest friends. And even if a perfectly normal person *did* do that, then they sure as hell shouldn't *look* normal. Honestly, I'm not even sure if his wife knows.

I talked it over with N. I proposed calling a crisis center. He thinks that's too drastic, and would rather we both just pay him a visit tomorrow AM. I agreed to that, because what else can I do? He's concerned they might take his kids away. I think considering there's two other lucid adults present, odds of that are low, but honestly have no clue. I definitely don't want to make things worse for the guy.

So I'm not sure what to do here. Is a crisis center the right option? Or are there better first steps? I'm in central TX.",09Jan2020,1
23,"Manic depressive, also borderline personality disorder, as well as intermittent explosive disorder. Anxiety, stress, depression, anger, these are normal every day emotions for me and they always feel cranked to 11. Was in the hospital in September on a 5150 and served the full 72hrs. On meds and seeing a doctor but it doesn’t help. 

I’m stressed at home 24/7 where my neighbors verbally harass and yell at me all hours of the day and night. Slamming every door or window. They yell at the top of their lungs all the time at each other and at me for no good reason. The daughter claims a mental disorder but only plays it up when the police are there. Otherwise she is yelling at me any time she even thinks I’m home or any time I walk out or in my front door. “Kill your self, psychopath, nobody wants you or ever will, ugly, criminal, handicapped loser, my bf will fuck you up.” Etc etc....Even when I am dead asleep(what little sleep I get) and just for hours on end. The police won’t do anything other than ask them to keep it down after 10pm. The HOA sent me a letter telling me to cease and desist contact with them about my “disturbance” and to only contact the PD. 

I hate both of my jobs. I’ve been demoted, suspended, and written up at both of them to the point where I have no future at either one after 7yrs. I get treated like absolute shit by some of the worst people imaginable due to working a bottom level customer service job in wealthy parts of town. I am constantly getting in trouble because of guest “complaints” half of which are only to get free stuff. And the other half are over exaggerated in a petty attempt to get me fired because they are unhappy with their service for one reason or another.

I am more and more disgusted with people on a daily basis. The way people treat each other, the complete and utter lack of common decency and respect. Simple greetings or respect for the working class is non existent in my area. The things people will get indignant about or in your face over are so varied that you are almost guaranteed to set someone off every single day. So many times I’ve almost been in car accidents because of stupid people on their phones. Or road rage incidents where people get out and try to reach in my window. I’ve had my vehicle damaged twice over the past two years by people because they felt slighted in traffic. 

I barely scrape by financially and my father works full time at age 60 to keep the roof over our heads. People will take one look at me and say, “oh you’re fine, quit complaining.” Or, “oh you must be doing well because of x, y, z.” When inside I’m drowning, both financially and emotionally.

My entire life I have had to take it, or “just ignore it” or “be the better man” when I am constantly kicked and beaten down and taken advantage of because I’m forced to play by the rules. I am angry all the time to the point I am physically sick from it. I feel tired even when I get a rare full nights sleep. I don’t know what to do. I am imploding and exploding. My relationships have suffered, my jobs, my family life, my friends have left. Soon I will have nothing left and part of me already doesn’t care.",09Jan2020,1

25,"Hello

Excuse my poor english.
 I’m a Norwegian 18 year old guy who’d like some advice. 
Half a year ago I quit organized skiing training. Skiing is something I had done practically all my life and something I heavily identified myself with. Whenever we had those Introduction/get-to-know-eachother games in class I would always introduce myself only by my name and the fact that I liked skiing. However in the past few years I have not enjoyed skiing training much and while in school I'd often dread the fact that I had to go skiing afterwards. I am relieved that I stopped skiing. Nowadays, the time that skiing training used to fill up is now filled with just momentary satisfactions I get from the Internet, watching TV-shows and reading. Reading has always been important for me, but especially when I was younger. I think I used books as a way to escape reality, not because reality was horrible or anything, but imagining myself as a person in the fantasy books was always much more desirable. There were times when I would literally spend a bigger part of the day reading than not reading. I didn't sleep enough because I'd be reading instead. Everyone around me stopped reading after becoming teens though and I am also reading less and less. I've also been lucid-dreaming a lot lately which is even more so an escape from reality. 

I think I am lacking an identity. If someone asked me today to introduce myself I wouldn't know what to say besides my name. My grades have plummeted the last half a year which I think has hit my self-esteem a bit. During school I often find myself too tired to work even though I haven't been doing anything special and when I have the strength to work I can't help but let my mind drift to think about other things (these things can be pretty random chains of thoughts sometimes involving things I've been reading or watching online. Often daydreaming too). I also have similar problems when working with school at home. My mind starts drifting as soon as I begin. I think this hurts my self-esteem a bit too. It doesn't conform with who I want to be.
Its hard to put my finger on it, but I feel like I'm always feeling quite distant from everything that goes on around me. I think I have felt like that for years.
Lately I think I have been feeling less and less. The momentary happiness I get from reading and the Internet is slowly disappearing and I also feel like I'm drifting away from my friends a little. I have a few friends but I feel like being with them is not as fun anymore and just takes my energy. Our interests are starting to differ and sometimes when I talk to them I feel like some of their comments are so bafflingly ignorant and stupid, but I'm not articulate enough in a conversation to tell them that in a nice way. So I just pretend like I agree and try to change topic.
I've been feeling sick an awful lot the past few months which my teacher told me could be related to the fact that I've been feeling a bit depressed, but I don't know about that. I never got sick before thought . It's hard for me to tell if I'm feeling particularly sad or not, but I am pretty sure I am a little bit depressed. 

I feel like a good way to get better and start feeling better about myself would be to find  something I can identity myself with quick. I have small interests, like drawing or programming and I have a book in my head that I really want to write (reading is not something I feel like I can identify myself with because I never tell people that I read, and I also have doubts about whether or not the way I read is good for me) I have also gained a great interest in 3-D animation programs recently and I want to learn how to use them so very much, but even so, when I begin using them, I just can't get forward because my mind is just not able to focus enough. I end up staring into a wall thinking about other things for a couple hours or just do something else. My mind rarely feels like it's completely in the present.
My grades are dropping, I'm starting to believe less in myself, I'm always tired but never working, I'm lacking an identity and I can't find one. I feel stuck. What do I do? How can I make my life a bit better?",09Jan2020,1

I have been attempting to reach out and get some professional help on my mental health for about a year now. It's steadily declining and I'm worried what it will result in.

Unfortunately I live in a small town so when I search for local help I don't see a lot of promising results. Idk if I need a counselor, a therapist, a doctor, a mental health professional, etc... Like where do I go and what do I do?

First, my mom passed away from cancer two years ago. I was away at college at the time, but my sister was here, with my dad, taking care of her. 

Second, my mom suffered from sever anxiety, sometimes even having panic attacks. My sister suffers from the same thing. She worries about some of the least important details and argues with my dad all of the time.

Third, she doesn't want to get professional help. She overreacts every time we even mention it to her. Even if I get replies here, and show them to her, she'll say not to trust everyone on the internet.

Fourth, my dad has been putting up with her arguments and emotional break downs for a lot longer than I have. Like I said, I've been away at college. His patients has been wearing thin. At this point, he is brute forcing his arguments, not honeying his words. As he said ""At this point, I don't care if I'm an asshole"" 

Fifth and final because I can't think of anything else, I rarely say anything. I am almost like my dad, in that I solve problems very practically. My point of saying this is, both me and my father do not understand her emotions. The only one who did was my mom. My dad has it in his head that he needs to solve this problem. He has straight up told me not to voice my observations or advice on my sister's condition, because ""it isn't my place to do so"". I can understand this. All of us don't know what we are doing, and he wants to be the one that messes up.

33,"ite so ive known for awhile I got a fucked up head was wondering if you guys may have any ideas what I may have

lets get started

1. I feel more when I kill a cockroach than when im directly responsible for someone dying
2. I have little to no empathy for people unless I am close to them and care about them
3. ive been responsible for 3 deaths never felt anything on either one of them
4. I feel more when I kill a cockroach than when im directly responsible for someone dieing
5. I am extremely good at manipulation faking friendships n such to get what I need or manipulating someone to kill themselves which is 2/3 of the deaths im responsible for
6. I feel smarter than everyone even though ik im probably dumber than most don't worry I don't go around being egotistical and stuff I usually keep my superiority complex to myself mostly cause im self aware enough to know that if anything im below average in most subjects
7. I have anxiety but I feel there isn't really ever a cause for it I get it randomly and I feel its triggered randomly
8. the only real cause ik for my anxiety is health paranoia I constantly get but there are times when I have anxiety without it being about non existent health problems
9. I get paranoid about people I feel its just based on my source of income is not whats considered legal and ive had to dealt with people online focused on bringing my group down and feds trying to gather information on us to track us down along with bad exes which makes it so I feel I cant be legitimate in a relationship and ususally just use them for sex instead of building a real relationship if that makes sense

Ever since I was little I couldn't cope with death. 
I remember when my friend lost her father, I went to the funeral with my mother and when I saw the open casket I actually started hysterically crying telling my Mother I need to leave the place. I always knew I hate funerals and visiting graves, it gives me a huge anxiety and makes me feel sad that I burst into tears just by going by a cemetery. Over the years I stopped going to cemeteries, talking or thinking about death, so I've been better. 

I'm now 19 years old, and my past month has been terrible.  I can't sleep, and I cry multiple times a day because of the thoughts that I'm going to lose my family someday, that I will die someday and that noone knows what will come after death. But what is giving me the most fear is losing my father and just that thought brings to cry about an hour, even tho he is perfectly safe and healthy in his early 40ies. Up until now I would get these thoughts every once in a while (myb every 3 to 6 months but then it would be because if my grandfather who's been gone since I was 7)

I don't know what is causing me to feel this way, I have a normal relationship to my family, I don't have any suicidal thoughts and no recent deaths occurred in my family either, and I get to see them everyday.

I'm actually not a person who easily cries or gets emotional in front of others,can someone please explain what is going on with me?",09Jan2020,1
46,"Hello !

I’ll make it short. My empathy is totally on the blink.
I’m way too empathic when it comes to fictionnal characters, like I can get sick as hell for a death in a movie or a TV show. I can even cry for a « I love you ». I had several anxiety attacks because of these. Same for real people I don’t know, like wars in the world, dying kids on the news. I’m super sensitive about animals too, just thinking about animal abuse makes me wanna cry.

But when it comes to close people, I feel nothing. I don’t hate them, I don’t love them either. My grand uncle is dead I felt nothing same for my grandpa, I even found the funerals untertaining (not the death of course but all the people the big church and all). My grandma found out she has cancer. I was like « oh ok damn ». My other grandparents have had health problems I was indifferent.. I avoid my mother and I’m fine with that. I think I would be indifferent to my cat’s death.

It’s fucked up I guess. You might think I am.

Are some people like this ? Or people you know ? My family complains I don’t talk to them but I just can’t speak my mind out loud it’s like blocked. I can’t bring myself to a therapist. I feel trapped I would like to tell em everything sometimes but the whole family would know and it could be a mess.

I don’t know what to do, any advice ?

At first , I prayed to God and trusted that he was going to take this all away from me. However , time kept passing by and I kept getting worse. I began to have very intrusive thoughts and began to feel afraid almost Paranoia about my life.  I was desperate. I felt suicidal. I talked to any person who was religious, priests, pastors from different churches, sisters, nuns, etc. Just to explain to me as to why God would let me go through something like that and why he  lets bad things happen to good ppl. I didn't feel God's love. I wanted answers, comfort, anything to make me feel better. But I would get the same advice, "" God is good. Pray harder."" Like sister, I've prayed , ugly cried, and begged God every night and day. I've distanced myself from church and religion as my perspective on it has changed since I got depressed.
The thing is , I know God doesn't work miracles just like that with just anyone. Or else no one would be dying right ?

49,"TW: mention of suicide, no details

I can't remember if this is where I posted about this originally, but whatever. Essentially the therapist I have been seeing for the past year or so is terrible, and through no fault of my own, I've only seen her twice in the past 3 months. 

So I've been oddly doing well for this period of time. Which is purely coincidental with when a good med change happened. But I have PTSD, so meds aren't gonna cure all. My psychiatrist is great, I've seen her for a while now and I REALLY like her. She validates what I'm experiencing, she communicates well with me (and my previous provider), she puts in a lot of extra time/effort to handle my case, and she will admit when she doesn't know/when she has made a mistake. 

My psychiatrist and therapist work in the same practice and somehow my therapist is upper management. Anyway, my therapist just dropped into my appointment, unannounced, to lecture me on ""not committing to treatment"". She literally went on vacation without giving me backup and didn't tell me she was back and her team is TERRIBLE to deal with on the phone to get info/schedule (like they have given me appointments that don't exist multiple times). 

And she tried to freaking blame me! She ghosted me! Then she tries to get me to beg for her back! uggg!!! No way!! She totally doesn't notice when I am getting better or worse, she broke HIPAA (in a minor way legally, but it really bothers me), she insisted my dad was a drug mule because he was visiting family in South America a lot (he has A LOT of issues, that is not one of them, and she knows almost nothing about him), and told me that I wasn't serious about suicide because truly suicidal people don't ask for help (when she wasn't even my doctor when I was hospitalized FOUR times for it)

I don't want to burden them with any of my problems and that I've been feeling depressed for two weeks.

I knew that I had a budget and blew it, which made my mom angry but what pushed her over the edge was when I slammed one of the car doors. 

I didn't want to show how frustrated I've become with my family but I've had enough of having no privacy. For example, I was calling a hotline and although I told her nonverbally to get out of my bedroom, she insisted on staying and attempted to comfort me. She reassured me by getting me water and tissues so that I can somewhat feel better. She told me that she isn't judgemental yet she judges the crap out of me. 

I'm tired of being told that I'm being a drama queen for simply wanting to express how I feel and I want to fix it. I'm sick of having no privacy and I want to get a vacation from this vacation before I go back to school where I can at least get a level of privacy and independence from my family. At least I'll see my friends and not have to put up with my sister. I'm tired of her as well.

I'm not willing to share too much because I don't have the mental energy to spill the tea on my family but I thought I can receive some support.",09Jan2020,1

I guess I do hear even the most highly treatable illnesses still have casualties (or other horrible consequences.) Did something go wrong somewhere? Or is it just what it is?

My low self esteem spiralled to a number of problems which affects me , my life and contributed to my mental health problems.

55,"For background, I have OCD, and have struggled with paranoia all my life. I wouldn't consider myself easily scared either by most things... Problem is, my paranoia is that bad things will happen if I get paranoid they will... I'm paranoid of my paranoia. I also get paranoid that things are in the room with me, not tangibly, but can hurt me somehow if I don't get rid of them ""right"". My intrusive thoughts get visual; not like hallucinations, but like an image you have trouble ""turning off"". It's not really like fear; I'm not scared of monsters, even though I'm paranoid of things in the room, but I can't ignore them because I think something bad might happen.

57,"As the title says, I'm just curious if he is showing symptoms of some sort of mental disorder. I'm not the most connected with him because we are two completely different people. We have completely different hobbies, interests and things like that, but he tends to be very irritating when it comes to talking to him. He tends to always have the mindset that he is right and nobody else is unless they agree with him. Apparently he is losing friends because he will talk to the point where he foams at the mouth before letting anyone else talk in a given conversation. And when I personally talk to him, he always has to get the last word in, and for this reason I can never bullshit with him because he always thinks that I am insulting him when in reality I'm just messing with him, not trying to hurt his feelings. He is extremely sensitive too, to the point where any sort of dicipline he either gets extremely defensive, or yells, or sometimes cries because he really cant deal with simple discipline. I also want to mention that he is extremely smart, he scored just below a 30 on the ACT in 8th grade and has a 4+ GPA with all honors and ap classes as a sophomore. Idk if it's important to mention but he isnt depressed as far as I can tell, or if he its it isnt chronic. Also, we have a happily married mother and father, who of which are both good parents, and neither of which had to go through any sort of divorce in our lifetimes, so no hostile background. 

Td;dr: My brother is extremely arrogant when talking with him and is at a point where he is losing friends because of his nessesant need to be right, which is also because of his book smarts. He is overly sensitive when disciplined and I feel he has some sort if mental illness, but I'm not sure. I just want to get him some help at least.",09Jan2020,1
58,"I'm a 17 year old with a traditional indian family. All my life I've been told that education and hard work is our only key to success and excelling in school is a must. Over the years I think I've pleased them with my grades but once I entered highschool it went downhill. My grades were average but to them it was just not my best. They've told me to my face that my grades are litteral shit and my dad has gone into fits of rage where he yells at me saying I'll never amount to anything if I keep this up and that when I end up on the streets he'll walk past me. He has anger issues and I know he loves me dearly but the things he says to me when he's mad makes me think otherwise. When I was more of a younger teenager I was caught with porn and stuff and I'd talk to my male friends in a flirty way. I was about 13. This kind of shattered my parents image of me and they and I had gotten over it. Or at least I thought. I once wore black leggings and a t shirt to go out once with my dad to volunteer at this area. I often wear this type of outfit a lot but suddenly my dad started to object saying I shouldn't wear ""black"" and I was confused because I wore this all the time and he began hitting me with metal hangers and whipping me with pairs of Jeans. My mom ran up to us once she heard the commotion and tried to stop him hitting me and he yelled ""she is a very vulgar girl she doesnt deserve anything"" and that broke me because the first thing he came to was to slut shame me or just shame me of my sexuality. This was still when I was 13. Fast forward to my freshman year of high school I had gotten my very first unofficial transcript and had gotten a 3.6 gpa. I didnt know what this meant so I looked it up and it had said it was a good gpa. I excitedly showed my parents because I wanted to be praised so bad and they shut me down so fast and said my grades were pathetic. I often go to parties and my friends often talk about their school life to the other parents and my own. My parents look almost bitter when they hear all these successful stories about them getting scholarships or winning the science fair and whatnot. I feel guilty because I've done nothing to make them proud. Whenever other parents ask me what my grades are like in school I just laugh and awkwardly look at my parents and again they just try to flash a smile. I get mostly Bs and to most this would seem ok but to them it's not. junior year came and I had loaded up with 4 aps.  1 of them being ap physics and this fucked me over. I ended up passing the semester with a D and I did horrible in math with a C. My semester gpa ended up as a 3.1 weighted and a 2.5 unweighted. My parents knew I had worked my ass off studying for physics and math for my final exams so they weren't that mad. Atleast at the moment. I've done some calculation and I've found that the max final gpa I can get for college is probably a 3.7 and this isnt good enough for them or me because I wanted a 4. Nearly all of my friends have gpas as high as 4.8 and I feel so fucking inferior to them. I had gotten a 1210 or something on the psat too. When I go to bed I can hear my parents talking about me sometimes. They sound sad. They say things like ""what is this child doing..what is she going to do"" and it breaks me because I dont want to displease them. Nearing the new year I was set on really pleasing them I really wanted to wow them with a dramatic school performance change by studying more and such. Well shortly before the new years I damaged our plumbing somehow and water leaked though the ceiling from the 2nd floor. Repairs are going to cost about 10k and I feel almost like something worse than shit. My mom came to me and said ""I know it was an accident but I dont know what we are going to do. I had just thought about saving for your college fees and your future but i have to throw it away here."" And i dont know what to do. I feel so guilty like I've done nothing to make them happy despite all they do for me.I dont know how to fight off this feeling for now. It hurts so bad and I cant concentrate on anything. What I want is a way to cope but what I really want is just reassurance from them. They dont tell me I make them happy or proud and atleast once I just want to hear it. I dont have the guts to ask them in person or to say it anyway at all. Because of me they cant be at peace. I dont want to feel this way but I cant help it.",09Jan2020,1
59,"So, in my house we are three, me (27M), my sister (31) and my mother (60).
Father left when I was 10, it was a big ordeal, my mother did what she could, and we lived.

I'm about to get married, and I wasn't as close to my sister as I am now, so we've been talking more. We started discussing some really erratic behaviors my mother has, usually forgetting specific events or remembering them quite differently. I'm a Neuropsychologist, so I know quite a lot about false memories and how human memory work, but I've never seen a case such as this. I'll exemplify: she is not dealing well with the marriage thing, my fiancee invited her to her graduation party, and I remember her saying yes. Everyone was around and remember her saying yes. When I asked her, she said (and I really believe that she believes it) that she never confirmed or said such thing. I also know that she doesn't really feel like going there, because she doesn't like my fiancee parents, so there is a gain in her not going.

Same goes for a few discussions, when she says that I told her things that I would never say, like that I don't love her, or that I didn't say things that I am positive that I did, I'm very careful with words, I know what I say. My sister has the same experience than me.

Now, to add it up, she has some friends that really idolize her, so she plays this social role as the good and understanding mother to a point where there is a certain cult of personality around her. People kissing her ass, this kind of stuff, because she is so wise and strong and all that. She clearly feeds on it, and wouldn't drop this situation for anything in the world.

She doesn't fill the criteria for narcissistic personality disorder, for example, but I'm still thinking about some personality- related disorder where the patient would be able to distort reality to this degree. I perceived that she behaves and feels exactly like all of these things are true, and really suffers from it, from the things that she thinks I said, but I didn't.

Not exactly sure as to how to deal with that. Perhaps could be some early dementia?  Or a personality thing? Anyone ever saw this kind of situation in a recurring scenario?

If I confront her and tell her to seek a professional, she will play victim and say that I'm trying to convince her that she is crazy, so taking her to a consultation is not a possibility.

61,"Hi, I (15F) have been worried about myself for a while now. I know a lot of teens often self diagnose themselves for having depression, especially girls, but I think I might need help and I’m not sure if I should tell my parents. I have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder already (it’s genetic, been being treated since I turned 13) and I’ve heard that can also cause depression. I’ve been having major scares lately with almost attempting suicide and have been contemplating cutting myself or self-harm. I’m tired all the time and I really am tired of living and I feel like it’d be better if I just died, plus I wouldn’t be so financially burdening to my parents. My parents have been struggling with their marriage lately and my mom always talks about leaving my step dad because of his children who have special needs because they’re so mentally taxing to her. I also just lost a best friend when I needed her most after telling her in August I almost tried to commit suicide, even after giving her every last drop of my love and support. I also have very low self-esteem and I just feel like such a mess, since I’m always tired no matter how much I sleep I nap a lot and my parents call me lazy. My mom threatened to put me in a mental hospital last time I had a panic attack and tried to do something to myself. I have antidepressants for my anxiety, (40mg of paroxetine) and apparently they can make you have suicidal thoughts but I just started having them in August, despite for taking them for two years prior with no problem. I also have a lot of other issues but if I brought them all up this post would be too long.
I’m just scared I’m going to go against all my instincts not to hurt myself and end up doing it soon, so I don’t know if I should seek help, like therapy. My mom says I wouldn’t have a reason to be depressed which I agree with but I haven’t talked to her about the full extent of my issues so I’m not sure.

TL;DR: having suicidal thoughts and having a hard time convincing myself to continue living even though I’m young. Not sure if I should see help.",09Jan2020,1

63,"I’m looking for some genuine responses, I don’t care if you disagree just be respectful yknow lol 


So I plan on attending University in the fall and I was thinking about getting a kitten to bring with me as an emotional support animal, as I have an anxiety disorder/depression which gets really out of control especially while I’m in school. The schools i have applied to all allow service/therapy animals in the dorms as long as you do what they ask before bringing it (having the proper qualifications, notifying that you will have the animal with you etc.)  which I will happily uphold. 

I have some family pets/low maintenance pets of my own at home who mean the world to me and are the reason why I’m pursuing a career related to animals, and I know it’s going to be very difficult for me to be away from them (I think about them even at work lmao). I think just having an animal with me is going to make me feel less alone when I’m stressed/sad and will help to keep my mood more stable. The reason why I’m choosing a kitten over an adult cat is because it’s going to be easier introducing a younger kitten to my current cat who is older, as I know she would not take to another adult cat well. She’s also too old for me to bring with me to school, and I wouldn’t want to stress her out (shes also a bitch and would be mean to my roommate/friends lol). I know that a kitten will still take time introducing, and I’ve already graduated high school so I am home and able to be hands on with getting the two cats acclimated to each other.

I currently work with animals and am aware of how much a cat costs and the requirements they have, but I guess I’m just looking to see if anyone has any personal experience with having a support animal through school or honestly just any thoughts on the idea, good or bad :)  Its hard to imagine what the situation will be like in school without actually having the kitten and experiencing it first hand, but I’d rather know all the pros and cons before fully committing. I’ll also provide more info if need be !",09Jan2020,1

By my nature I am a type of person who’s often drawn to quiet places and be alone. So it makes me more suffering and to waste time.

66," I was physically and sexually abused as a little boy. I think I have PTSD and BPD but I am not going to claim I do because I haven’t seen anyone. I am actually going tomorrow. I just can’t cope. I can’t hold down even a part time job. I spent the entire time feeling like breaking down at every moment. Even almost did at times. I was tearing up just a few feet from my coworkers but none of them noticed because I made sure to hide my face. I can’t sleep at night. I’m always up until 4-5 am and I wake up at 3-4 pm. I avoid things that stress me out like the plague. Feels like everyone around me is pressuring me to start a career but I don’t know if I can even handle a simple part time job. I feel like a deadbeat. Like eventually I will have to get a job, and the stress will put me further into depression and anxiety. I’m not suicidal, but I’m always the closest to suicide thoughts when I am at work. I avoid adult responsibilities. I am almost 19 and I still don’t have a driver’s license. I withdrew from my physics course at the last moment so I didn’t have to go. I avoid physical confrontation and I avoid romantic relationships ever since I was molested. No one in my family knows I was molested. Only 3 of my closest friends know. I have never told anyone face to face, mostly because I suck at social interaction in general, and it wouldn’t get any easier talking about such a serious topic. I just don’t find joy in anything anymore. Only distraction. I sit in bed and fantasize. Sometimes when I am getting flashbacks it feels like  I am seeing something happening to someone else, not me. Sometimes I see it happening from outside my body. Every flashback feels like being stabbed. Sometimes I can even almost feel his legs wrapped around mine and his hand grabbing me through my swim shorts. I have anger issues and mood swings that I think are connected to my abuse. I can be very kind and considerate, and then someone insults or judges me negatively and I explode in anger. Sometimes I even lose the ability to feel empathy or sympathy until I have calmed down and I feel bad. I feeling sad and lost to feeling extreme anger and a wanting for revenge. I want to beat the shit out of pedophiles. There is a pedophile that rubs a video store near me and I fantasize about jumping him when he closes his store at night. I fantasize about finding a pedophile abusing a little boy and I beat the shit out of them and I hug and comfort the little boy. I want to attack all pedophiles but the fantasy always includes a little boy. I guess he’s a surrogate for me. Sometimes I feel hopeful and optimistic, but it only lasts a few seconds, and then it’s gone just like that. They are very fleeting. I hate the expectations people have put on me. Sometimes I just want to run away and go live on a beach or something. I hide all of these feelings. No one knows I feel them. The only one people really see is the anger when I can’t hold it in. Other than that I seem completely normal. People just assume I am okay, because I look okay. I was always the kid that never had any problems so my parents paid more attention to my siblings who had more problems. I think that has caused me to crave attention. I don’t seek it out, but whenever I get it I am happy. It’s a great feeling. I won’t lie, I get excited whenever I get a notification here or on any other social media. I get excited in anticipation.

I obviously don't want to tell her not to go, I'm not controlling, I want her to have fun with her friends etc.

I keep obsessing how I want a goth or alternative girlfriend, as a result to soothe my obsession, I engaged in a compulsion where I added a dozen of alternative people on social media. To further relieve the pain i messaged a few goths to  try and get some validation or for them to want to date me, when I failed It made my pain much worse.

I know looking at goth girls and alternative people will trigger me deeply because I know I'll never date one but I still add them nonetheless. I am aware I am triggering myself by doing this but I feel so powerless to stop it.

73,"WARNING! TALK OF ANIMAL ABUSE AND GORE!
So starting from the beginning when I was between 5 to 11 years old I use to abuse animals badly, most passed, and a few went to good homes. During this time I felt no feelings while abusing these animals, my parents never taught me better because I always hide it behind their backs. They did eventually catch me and I realized it was wrong because I would get into serious trouble and so I stopped abusing. When I started getting older 12 to 18 years old never felt thankful for anything, I hardly ever thought about the people and friends around me. Their feelings and emotions just didn't connect, I could relate but when they started to cry or feel awful I just couldn't feel for them. During this time and now being touched by my family, friends, and others felt uncomfortable, as if they were strangers. There was a time when my mom's ex came home beaten up and I looked at him but didn't know wether to tell if he was smiling, if I should feel bad, or maybe shocked. During this time I have also discovered gore, I'll admit I watched and seen A LOT but it doesn't make me sick, it makes me a little uneasy only because most look painful. A few days ago my sister's boyfriend told me about a site that shows random videos and images by clicking a button on the screen. One video popped up and it was a man getting his throat slit, he was rushingly trying to exit out of the site but heard the ""horrid"" gargling noises of the man choking on his blood. He told me he felt a horrible feeling and said it was terrible because he watched someone die, someone who might have had a family. I thought about it and it made sense but I just can't feel what he felt. I am 20 years old now and I've ALWAYS been told to think about others, be kind, and listen to them but wasn't that something I was supposed to pick up on when I was small? I just don't understand why it's so hard for me to pick up on emotions and to think about others, I literally have to try and think about how they feel but I always have to fake it. Sure I do feel when it comes to break ups, love, and affection but not with my family, friends or other people. I would talk about this with a therapist but I currently can't find one so..

The adhd meds have been helping me for the past 10 months really well but when I started taking the Zoloft everything kind of went haywire even though it was already fucky. 

First off I immediately lost all of my sex drive. This is bad because before hand I was literally a sex fiend. Constantly horny constantly wanting to try and do new things with my BF (a very helpful and wholesome supportive man trying his best). Now it’s almost all gone, and the rare event it does come it’s gone in a flash. It’s really impacted our relationship not just for him being accustomed to a certain amount of sex (he’s not voiced any complaints but I get the vibe he’s missing it) but also decreased my confidence and feeling of intimacy. 

Second off, where the fuck did my trust go? Earlier in our relationship, my bf really helped learn to trust people and him. I had a rough childhood (who hasn’t these days) and it lead to a huge trust in people and authorities. He helped me learn to be more trusting and proved through action he is a trustworthy and earnest man. I opened up to him in ways I’ve never opened up to anyone, including my old therapist and my father who I’m really close to. 

Now that I’m on the Zoloft I’m coming up with conspiracy after conspiracy that I can’t trust him that he doesn’t trust me that he doesn’t love me that he’s just with me because he’s scared of my health etc etc despite his constant reassurance and proving otherwise. In my consciousness I know he’d never lie to me or manipulate me and that he loves me, but we get into the smallest argument and it goes poof. I feel almost paranoid, like my brain is picking up on small things that prove he is manipulating me that don’t even exist. 

Needless to say it’s putting a huge strain on our relationship and that’s putting a huge strain on my stability. I hate to admit it, but right now I’m very emotionally dependent on him. It’s not where I want to be, and I have a plan to seek therapy to work on it, but it’s the sad truth. He says if I can’t trust him, we shouldn’t be together, and that freaks me out despite being a pretty reasonable assertion. 

How do I talk to my psychiatrist and soon to acquire therapist to tinker with my meds or start the right path to working on this? The Zoloft has stopped the irrational “kill yourself it’s the easiest solution” thoughts I was having before but the mental and physical side effects are killing me as well. I was able to trust my bf pretty well before I started taking it and now it seems to be working to worsen my paranoia and anxiety rather than ease it. 

Would like any commentary or advice y’all are able to give!",09Jan2020,1
76,"i think somethings wrong with me, please help

so, i don’t know what’s like happening to me, but i think i’m going crazy. 

i have like.. officially messed up my sleep schedule because i’m on a school break. i wind up going to sleep around 5am-8am and sleeping  until like 12-3. i know it’s really bad, but i honestly can’t help it now. 

anyway,  it doesn’t matter where i’m at or what time it is (it’s worst when i’m the only one awake or home alone) but i keep hearing and seeing things and i think i’m seriously loosing it. 
it’s mostly out of the corner of my eye and very quiet or faint noises, but they still scare the crap out of me.  it’s usually the worst around like two in the morning to the time i go to sleep, unless my dad or step moms awake. 

but the weird thing is the thing i see is either a women in all white with black hair kinda like the grudge i guess..? but she has a weird smile and it literally freaks me out. or a tall black figure. 
i usually see the women peeking over my parents door frame and then i turn to look and it’s gone. the black figure is usually in corners like, the corner of my room the corner of my house, my parents closet. 

the noises i hear are like, floor boards creaking, random bangs, and like footsteps (i have two cats and a dog so i guess that could be the noises) 
one of my cats, (kilala, she’s a black short haired cat) sees and hears these things too because she’ll look over at it too. sometimes i don’t even hear it and she does so i’ll look over and start panicking. i just get that like, overwhelming feeling you know..? like a weird anxiety when stuff like that happens. 

another weird thing is i have randomly developed a fear of my dog. ( he’s old, black, blind, and diabetic lab/boxer mix) i don’t know why, i know he wouldn’t hurt me on purpose, but i just feel so scared and uneasy around him like he’ll just suddenly morph into a freaking demon and that just makes me not trust him. i’ve had him all my life and i’ve only recently become terrified of him. he’s never bitten me or anyone else unless it’s like play fighting and even then it’s not hard, i just legitimately have no reason to be scared but i am. 

i also have started distrusting/ fearing people. it’s gotten to the point where i lock all the doors, knob and bolt lock, and close all my blinds. i’m constantly in fear that someone will break into my house. i’m constantly in fear that a drive by or something will happen ( never happened in my neighborhood) and i’m just super paranoid for no reason. 

i can’t tell if some of this is normal or i’m just being haunted, but please give me tips on how to stop this and just get over the fear of my own dog and friends/family/ people in general because i miss being able to trust them.",09Jan2020,1

i literally just want to sleep but whatever the hell is following me isn’t letting me. i see it and i hear it and i just wanna be left alone. 
it’s just in the corner of my eye and i think it’s a women but i can’t look fast enough but i know she’s there. i’ve seen her in my mirrors and it’s almost every time i close my eyes she’s there. 
it’s just gotten worse and i can barely sleep over it. she’s gotten louder. 
i was trying to take a nap the other day because i’m always tired now and something coughed directly into my ear. it was so loud it felt like my ear was bleeding. and literally a couple minutes before posting this, i heard knocking on my wall ( everyone’s asleep and my cat was laying beside me) 
i thought, ‘maybe if ivory (my cat) doesn’t react it’s not real, right?’ and she didn’t at first. she was still for a couple seconds before she shot up like she saw something and left my room. 
i’m so scared i want to cry. i can’t tell anyone about this shit cause i don’t wanna be called crazy. everything’s just getting worse and i don’t know why..

83,"I don't know if this is the right sub but I at least want to vent a bit.

For my own sanity(and maybe yours too) I want to explain what I mean by 'false truths'.  I'll know I didn't really do anything wrong but I find a sliver of what's wrong and exaggerate it.

Just for some background my dad doesn't want my boyfriend to come inside the house when he's gone and to tell him- my dad- if my boyfriend's going to pick me up. I've done this before where my boyfriend will pick me up from the front and then we'll go.

 So I tell my dad yesterday he's going to pick me up and he's okay with it. At least until I come home. He wasn't angry but he did seem upset saying that the neighbors said that I let him in and that we were kissing in front of the house and much worse things, to quote him ""I thought my ears were going to start bleeding"". I admit to him yes we did kiss but I did not under any circumstance let him in- which is true. And he pressed me a bit about letting him in and again I reiterated it and that was that. But now I can feel myself lying to myself thinking that yes I did let him in, the neighbors seen therefore I must be lying and I violated my dad's trust and it. Just. Won't. Stop.

I KNOW I didn't let him in I've told my boyfriend under no circumstance is he allowed in when my dad's not around. But again I hear ""you did let him in he was on the porch and near the doorframe therefore you did"".

Idk it all seems pretty pathetic and not really... bad in the scheme of it all compared to what others go through but this is consuming me and I've had this problem before and I just want it to stop. I want to get this off my chest so I can get some advice on how to deal with this.

88,"Since elementary school, I've been a hyperactive kid who had an estranged relationship with her mother that lead to me having a hatred of her until 8th grade. She was raised with the, ""spare the rod, spoil the child"", mentality and that's how she raised us. Bad behavior was met with being hit, yelled at, and punished. My mom had mostly male siblings growing up and is EXTREMELY strong, especially to a child. As you can imagine, as an elementary school kid, my mother constantly hitting and yelling at me did not make me feel very good about myself. She also verbally attacked me such as calling me stupid, lacking any common sense, etc. Combined with the kids at school who called me fat and ugly, I had no self-confidence and a deep self-loathing. I constantly lied to her due to a hatred for the woman who caused all my hurt, which of course, made my relationship with her 100x worse. My mom hates lying above all else. I'm not going to say that everything about that time was horrible but it caused me to want to die in elementary. I prayed to God to strike me down and kill me. My mom sent me to therapy for probably 2-1/2 years to combat my pathological lies, (I kept my thoughts about death to myself), that I had grown into.

Fast-forward to 6th grade where our arguments were becoming extremely frequent and I would come to school crying almost every day and be comforted by my friends. Thankfully, school made life so much better because the people around me made my feel like a champion. Sure, I never thought that highly of myself but a lot of people knew me and I was pretty well liked. It was a stark contrast to how I felt when I got home. I felt like my autistic younger sister was better and more loved than me when I was at home.

Fast-forward to 7th grade where my life went downhill. My relationships at school had me on cloud nine but my home life got worse and worse. I started think about how all my friends probably secretly hated me, (being high so energy meant that I was a really annoying kid but I couldn't help it). Life at home sucked as always.

I eventually went from praying for God to kill me to wanting to kill myself.

One day in class, and it was a Friday afternoon, (that day is burned into my memory I swear), a classmate was complaining about *something* bad going on in her life. That made me feel bad about my life. Then I snapped. I got hysterical, opened my backpack, took out my safety scissors in the middle of class and tried to *fucking stab my wrists* right then and there like a fucking maniac. I didn't get hurt because they were safety scissors tho \\(-\_-)/. My friends grabbed them away and the other girl and I stepped out of class to be in hysterics away from everyone else. Needless to say, I was taken to a mental hospital that night. My mom had CPS on her ass for potential abuse, (which I ended up denying like a coward), and I was homeschooled for the rest of the semester. I wasn't allowed to be left alone because I could hurt myself. I was only allowed to write with crayons and stayed in a corner all day when I wasn't doing work.

My mother hated me then. Apparently, I only wanted attention. She told me so. I had just tried to end my life and she hated me for it. Not out of concern. I was like a piece of shit in her home. She was gonna put me up for adoption.

Half a year later, somehow we were able to bounce back from that. I went to a new middle school for 8th grade and life was never better. I got straight A's for the entire year. I was so happy to be out of the house.

I'm in high school now and that entire experience has fucked up my head. Although my mother and I have never gotten along better, I came away from the whole thing scarred.

My thoughts are rapid and loud. I have the urge to harm myself via cutting. I'm typing this with 6 fresh new cuts right now. Death and killing myself is in my head every week even though I don't truly want to. At the same time, everything is pointless. My mood can change within moments. I don't sleep the same way as before. I feel perfectly fine on the 3 hours of sleep I've had. Sometimes I'm so passionate and creative that my head feels like it's gonna burst with ideas. I'm always so happy and sad at the same time and if I don't get some help soon, I'm gonna snap.

My mom hated me the last time I needed help. What do I do? I'm hurting myself emotionally and physically. If I tell the doctor what's happening to me, I don't know how she'll react to hearing my talk about suicide. I don't want to open old wounds. What do I do?

TL:DR; My mom reacted badly the last time I snapped and hated my for it. A traumatic childhood has messed up my head and I think I'm bipolar but I'm scared of what asking for help could mean or change.",09Jan2020,1

90,"I'm struggling with my mental health. Just got out of the psych ward. They put me on antidepressants and kept me in long enough to make sure there weren't side effects.

While in there, when I spoke to the psychiatrist once a week, I asked her if there really is anything wrong with me. My best guesses were I had some sort of brain damage, Schizophrenia or Autism. I scored high on all those ""Have you got..."" tests for both Schizophrenia and Autism. 

Throughout my entire life I've felt completely different from other people. Everybody else seems to function fine. I feel like everybody I meet knows something that I don't. Everybody is ""in"" on something. It makes me feel like there is something wrong with me and they just don't want to tell me. Kinda like meeting somebody with a horrible disfigurement, but you obviously never mention it coz it's rude, but you know it's there. You might be overly kind to that person because you feel sorry for them and walk on eggshells around them. That's how I feel with my interactions with everybody. Like they know there is something wrong with me, so they take it real easy on me, and I'm completely unaware.

So in this last admission I spoke to 3 different psychologists about this, and they all said ""there's nothing wrong with you. You are a bit 'immature' because of something that happened in the past. But we believe you don't have Schizophrenia or Autism. You're just depressed because of past life events"" I even asked a few family members to swear to me that there is nothing wrong with me and they all said there isn't anything wrong with you. One aunt did reply back ""everybody is different"" though.

If that's the case then why have I not been able to shake this feeling my entire life? That there is something in fact wrong with me. I agree depression could definitely be a part of what is wrong with me but there's no way that it's the only thing or even the main thing. Would a psychiatrist lie if it's supposedly in your ""best interest""? My last admission I was in there for suicidal thoughts and the reason I believe they lied, is because maybe they thought if I was properly diagnosed that might tip me over the edge and end it all? Would they do that? I felt like a lot of the nurses/OT were lying too and wondered if the doctors tell them what and whatnot to speak about with certain patients. Such as ""If they bring up this, try and switch the subject because it might make them worse""

IDK what to believe anymore.",09Jan2020,1
91,"To put things into context, I was first diagnosed with depression when I was 15. I don’t remember much of that year but can recall the general symptoms. The diagnosis fit: I had a flat mood, was unmotivated/persistently tired, felt worthless and was suicidal, rapidly gained weight, got no sleep, my relationship with my parents, friends, school were strained, etc. 

I only started to feel better when I started dieting and going to the gym everyday. So about 1/2 - 1 year after my diagnosis I thought I had fully recovered from depression. Unfortunately it was through my obsession to lose weight and my resulting eating disorders that I managed to do so.

As soon as I stopped restricting however, I started getting panic attacks and unmanageable anxiety levels. What I thought was depression came about 6 months later after a shoulder injury and poor performance physically.

I became plagued with thoughts of suicide and my self esteem plummeted during this time. I gave into a perfection complex and believed that I was worthless and had felt so tired. I lost interest in the sport I loved because of how poorly I was playing with the injury and my first assumption was that I was relapsing and was experiencing a second depression. I sought out a therapist who confirmed this.

This was back in August of 2019 and seeing my doctor today has made me realize how different the second episode has been for me. My mood is not persistently flat, I feel quite a large range of emotions actually (anger, sadness, guilt, desire, happiness, etc); I’m not bed bound and engage in social activities; I sometimes have a period of time in an elevated or emotional mood that can’t really be explained; and cry all the time. Even in my first episode while I would cry from time to time, I shut down most of my feelings and don’t remember doing so as frequently as I do now. Right now, I feel emotionally unstable and I’m not sure what’s going on with me.

94,"I’m concerned of a friend of mine. We (both 19F) are roommates at college and I’ve known her for about four months now. She has Pyroluria, which I have never heard of until she opened up to me about it when we first met. I’ve done some research about it but since it’s not a common disorder there’s little information out there so what I know comes from her. From getting to know her these past months, I think she may have some personality disorder since as she has shown many signs of self-image issues and I’m really worried. 

Here are her signs: 

• Pretending to not know common American things (Cheetos, Billie Eilish, KFC etc) I’ve caught her in these lies and know for a fact that she knows these things from stalking her Instagram. She basically pretends to not know things and plays dumb to create a shock factor to her friends. 

• Pretends to have a German accent (She is American and her grandparents are from Germany, but she doesn’t speak the language. I’ve met her twin sister and she doesn’t have this ‘accent’. It’s very obvious as she puts on this ‘accent’ when we’re out with friends but when she talks to me in our room she drops it. 

• She told me that in high school she faked her voice for 4 years, even with her long-term boyfriend, to a high pitched voice cause she doesn’t like her voice. 

• She pretends that Spanish is her native language, although it is her 2nd language that she learned from school. When she is upset, she will start speaking to people in Spanish that she knows doesn’t speak Spanish and makes me translate to them. She told me several times that she wants to move to an island in Spain and cut off everyone, even her family. 

• Says that she never gets angry but I can clearly tell she surprises her anger at times. 

• She has told me several times that she is afraid of being abandoned or betrayed by her friends once we move to another residence hall next year.  

Overall, she has created this whole different personality to shield her true self. I think she wants to be special and different but she goes to the extremes to do so. I don’t know much about mental health or Pyroluria so if anyone can give me any advice on approaching her about this nicely or how I can get her help it would be greatly appreciated.",09Jan2020,1

In retrospect I find some events and incidents affected me in a way beyond my understanding and capability, leaving me alone in apathy and anger that I didn't even acknowlege existing. I didn't know who I was (I still don't) and never really felt understood, so I chose to act out for the wounds to be exposed. Something hurt me so bad in the past that I couldn't let go and it's like if I carry on with my life built on the legacy of those sufferings and pain, it makes them actually beneficial instead of toxic. They become experiences that nurtured me instead of trauma that hurt me on a deeper level. Successful people proudly talk about their torturous past to inspire others and give themselves a pat on the back but I can't. I still can't be grateful for what I went through because it just hurt so much. In addition, I grew up in a culture that glorifies oppression. We're taught to grit our teeth and push through the toughest situation possible. Nobody taught me about feelings and now I can't deal with it at all.

I still want to say I'm in pain because of all the things that happened but it just feels insignificant and makes me go back and question myself more. It's not only for the people around me to see, but actually more for myself to acknowledge that oh look indeed you suffered!!! There's no better demonstration than a real physical wreck.

97,"So, for the past 4 years I've been pursuing a hobby in illustration, and I like to think I've done some quick improvement on my art.

However, recently I've been having some troubling thoughts and anxiety related to my drawing.

I've never been very consistent with this hobby. I can spend literally a dozen hours straight working in a piece, but then take a whole month or even more to pick up the pencil again. I know I have it in me to draw every day, I've done month long challenges before, but outside of those challenges my mood just isn't in the right place most of the time, and I think I've figured out why.

Before starting a project I feel some anxiety, which I have reasons to belive are linked to feelings of inadequacy; I'm predicting my art piece won't be as good as I envision it, or I won't be able to pull it off at all. I see these artists posting multiple drawings a day and I just feel worse that I can't push myself to do a simple doodle because it might suck ass.

Also I have done some stuff that would be considered horrible in the past like being physically abusive to animals, people, lying and being manipulative. I love to manipulate and get my things done from people. I have no guilt or remorse of what I have done and I still do it and would do it again except hurting others physically.

I  scared and alone. The people here are ducking awful. I feel so infantlozwd and dehumanized.


This is not treatment. it is captivity.

I being treated like a criminal.

The staff are nurses before human beings.

Wr are patients before we are human beings.

One of these nurses had the gall to tell me that I’ve refused to take responsibility for my part In this.


There is a severe lack of humanity to here and it is absolutely disgusting.

I’m stunned. I am livid.

Yet the more I show any emotion whatsoever, the more likely I stay longer.

These people don’t know me.

I’ve attempted to get contact withy therapist who knows about my history with in patient facilities. She can vouch for why this is bad for me.

101,"I constantly feel like a complete and total failure at basically everything. I was thinking that I  was feeling this way because I was being lazy and unproductive but I've been trying really hard to at least do something productive every day. I'm still working on it but logically I know that I'm at least doing something. 

For example, today I worked on my schoolwork, did some laundry and worked on crocheting a nest for rescued birds in Australia. But instead of feeling good about any of the things I did, I'm internally criticizing myself for not doing more.

I feel like this inner voice comes from my grandparents who raised me and always expected perfection. Everything always had to be so clean and I had to get straight As and do sports and play piano. They weren't abusive and they gave me a good life that my mother couldn't give me and I'm so grateful for that but I just feel like I'll never be able to get their voices out of my head always telling me I need to do better and do more and be better and I  just feel like I'm never going to be happy. Part of me is so mad at them for this even though I know they were just doing their best. But then I feel guilty for being mad at them because they gave me such a good life and they didnt have to.

I can go fill up a cup of water, leave it on the counter and comeback a few minutes later to fill up another one forgetting I had done one and left it on the counter.

I can walk somewhere and forget why I'm heading that way then turn around.

I forget words so often, everytime I say a sentence I'm stuck with the ""hummmm the hmmm"". It's getting a bit frustrating.

When in a conversation if the other person asks to hold on a second I'm very likely to forget what I had in my head.

If someone new tells me their name it will take a few times before I remember it if I don't note it on my phone.

As a kid I'd ask the same question more than once, don't know if this matters. I don't think I am asking the same question over and over now, at least I haven't had people angry at me like I had as a kid.

In tv shows like game of thrones, Emilia Clarke is topless but game of thrones became one of the biggest shows in tv history and she became really famous from it. That’s not the situation I’m talking about. I’m talking about small projects or guest tv spots where the actresses are nude for no real purpose.

Then, panic attacks, derealization, and a ridiculously long list of physical sensations ranging from tingling all the way to ear popping and jaw pain. Now, I just realized I’ve been depressed for years, abit since highschool but progressing terribly within the last 4 years. I have a diagnosis of GAD but my therapist has noted I have symptoms of panic, definitely depression, and a lot of social anxiety. 
I have had some brief hallucinations in the past. I had a crappy month of sleep, high anxiety and some depression, had a auditory hallucination in my head one morning after being woken up and still tired. 

My therapist is aware of everything that I’ve experienced but she says she’s not concerned for several reasons. I can’t stop wondering and fearing over what’s going on with me. I wonder and obsess constantly. My life has already been so hard I’m just afraid of it getting any worse. And I’m afraid something else is going on besides just anxiety and depression.

My wife graduated as a lector about 2 years ago, and have worked as teacher for 1st and 2nd year kids since. She puts very much effort in it, and I know for a fact that she is a fantastic teacher. She has been having a lot of headaches almost since she started working, and she has tried different treatments, some work a little bit, some don't. The last  5-6 months she has been having a hard time coping with all of it.   


She comes home from work very tired and goes straight to bed to get away for a bit, I often follow her, and try to comfort her, and sometimes (about once a week) she cries to me, talking about how afraid she is that the headaches will never stop, and that she will go mad if this (her troubles in general) continues. She has also started to gain weight, because of medication and less excercise (she is the strongest woman I know, and quite fit, but she has gained about 5kgs of fat) and she hates it, on top of all the other things.)  


I try to say to her that she should try lowering the bar a bit, do the necessary work and not so much extra. And take time to relax once in a while. Lately she has been having trouble sleeping aswell, which makes it all worse. I try to talk to her about how she might get more calm and tired in the evening, and repeat that she should try to get a little less amount of stress from work.   
I also tell her that it is more important that she feels well, and enjoy life than the couple of kgs she gains. 

On top of all this I DO listen, and I use a lot of time just listening and make her feel ""seen"". But like I said, lately, she's been having a even harder time lately, and cries even more than usual and my help has started to have less effect.  


I don't know any more guidance to give her, or how to help or comfort her anymore.   
If anyone have some advice on how to deal with this, maybe even some nice, bright ""views on life"" that I can try to share with her, or any other knowledge to share with me!  That would be amasing.

i have identified as trans for years now with a family that choses not to support me and often tells me they wish i didn't exist as i ""ruined their lives"". after years of simply brushing everything under the rug, my mental health is suffering and declining insanely fast. i now suffer from (untreated) dissociation, depression, anxiety and ocd. i lock myself in my bedroom for hours and have depressive episodes daily. 

a few months back i secretly bought a wig and an eyeshadow palette but since my mum constantly invades my privacy, she found it hidden deep in a draw and i was petrified. she immediately told me to throw it out and threatened to tell the rest of my family. my grandfather who has passed away was a priest, so my mum is very religious.

i have no support system. i am bullied relentlessly at school and honestly i don't think i can go back after these holidays. i go to a conservative catholic school in australia and i have one friend who oddly enough is also trans. we have notified our school about the harassment we face only for it to backfire as they called my mum (even though i pleaded with them not to) and not to my suprise my mum blamed me for ""giving people a reason"" to harass me. and the harassment didn't even stop since dozens of people join in. 

my sister was diagnosed with depression a few years ago and my mum immediately took it very seriously. but for me it's just so different. she knows i get bullied &amp; suffer but choses not to support me. i asked to visit a therapist and all she could say was ""you have bigger issues, do your homework"". i'm so exhausted and i don't know what to do.

115,"She’s 22 and comes from a long history of trauma. Her dad is a bad alcoholic and used to be very verbally and emotionally abusive to her family when she was young. They fled from her father about 12 years ago, but she so clearly has dependency and mental health issues because of this. 

Since her dad left, she has had about 7 boyfriends back to back. She is never single and needs a boyfriend for reassurance and support. I’ve always tried to explain to her that this is not healthy and she needs to learn how to be alone, but she is so incapable of being alone because of what her dad did to her. She’s also been cheated on more times than I can count and has trust issues and insecurities from this too. 

In general, her mental health has been so terrible lately I feel so bad. She has been very depressed and anxious and sees a therapist for trauma. She has been cutting herself on and off since she was younger. She apparently made suicide comments to her roommates while she was drunk recently. She would freak out on her boyfriend all the time and she became very controlling with him. He was really patient but he finally had enough and he broke up with her out of the blue last week.

Since they’ve broken up, she has not cried once even though she was head over heals with him. I think she is in a state of emotional shock and denial and her brain can’t even rationalize it. She seems okay from the outside, but as her best friend, I know she’s dying on the inside (she holds everything in). I’m genuinely fearful of what she may do when this break up sets in.

My real name is Christopher, which means ‘follower of Christ.’ My alter ego’s name is Daemon, which means Demon. 

Chris is very empathic, courteous, gives others what he has. He’s open-minded toward everybody and tends not to judge. He enjoys uplifting music. He’s thoughtful and remorseful, pensive and cautious at times. Loves animals. Conflict avoidant. Sad, melancholic. Enjoyable to be around. 

Daemon is the complete opposite. He is extremely arrogant, self-entitled. He even dresses differently, wearing black or dark colors and a big, black fur hooded coat, etc. red shoes. He listens to different types of music. He even likes vampires. He’s edgy, he steals, he drinks a lot, he uses drugs excessively, he lies compulsively. And he even gets into physical fights with strangers. Does what he wants. Violent. Very cynical. 

There is such a marked contrast between these two that it’s insane. Chris is well-liked, people tel him he’s a great guy. The other, people judge, don’t wish to be around.

For the past 4 months I've been questioning everything from asking myself if I'm actually enjoying activities that I like like playing/listening to music or hanging out with friends to just simply watching a movie or working towards my goals. I question if there's truly a purpose to what we do in life. I do suffer from GAD but its under control by lifestyle changes. (medication made sleepy and gave me suicidal ideation) These questioning thoughts came after an anxiety crisis from back in May of 2019 due to work-induced stress, ever since, things have not been the same.

118,"Hey so I'm making this post because I feel like I don't have anyone I can turn to that will understand and lack any therapy options. 

My problem is my mental and surprisingly physical lack of motivation to improve my life and zero satisfaction from anything positive that happens to me. It's like my body forgot how to function in a society. Mentally, I keep a routine, I think positive and strive to study and work hard. I make a conscious effort to do so, however some time ago I feel like my body stopped listening to me and just keeps me in a stagnant state. 

For example: I struggle to wake up to class. But not in a normal ""I'm lazy"" kind of way. I sleep my 8 hours or more and unconsciously turn off my alarms. I tried putting my phone further. Also didn't work. I asked my roommates to wake me up. I took a shower, sat on a chair to blow dry my hair and fell asleep like that (!). It's extremely troubling. I struggle to clean my house, do laundry, even commute to work or to do groceries. I often catch myself falling asleep in random places even though I slept plenty.

I also struggle remembering things. I have been well prepared for my exams this January but so far it's  been a disaster. I forget everything I've done and learned right when I'm in the class. The only thing I can focus on is that I want to get out of the room. When working out  (I'm trying to lose weight) I feel extremely weak and redundant to continue pushing myself even though I have barely started my exercise. I eat well and care to not strain my body so I don't know why is this happening.

The worst of them all is probably that I can't be arsed to care. I tried so many ""advices"" from so many people that failed nonetheless. I only feel like everything I'll try will end up being yet another failure. I feel no satisfaction from completing tasks or getting something right for a change. My self esteem is very low and I feel I'm lying to myself when I try to think positively about my appearance/personality, like I don't care to live or die. 

Revising and studying is twice as long as normal for me because my thought process is so slow. I can't seem to feel a kick from it anymore.

My wit and humor also faltered. I often catch myself being very obnoxious and silly without a reason. I don't feel happy or accomplished in the slightest. Any attempt to improve seems to be fruitless because my mind says ""go on"" but my body will start randomly hurting or feeling strained/fatigued.

I'm a 14 year old boy. I often have moments where I just feel like shit. I can feel just empty, or like I'll never succeed at what I want to do, or guilty that I don't do enough, all of that good stuff. I also feel anxious at school all the time, and have to watch what I do or say every second I spend there.
Because of that, I decided one time at like 2 AM to look up ""teenage depression,"" read multiple articles, and I found that some symptoms match mine. Specifically getting angry and lashing out more often, sleeping too much (12 hours usually), feeling drained all the time, lacking the will to do anything, and, rarely, some weird shoulder pain.

I would try to visit my school counselor, but I just can't seem to find her most of the time. I'm also considering a psychologist, but I'm afraid of what mom will think if I tell her *""I think I have mild depression,""* and God forbid dad heard any of it.

Since the breakup he has improved his communication and has worked on his temper and judgmental issues and even bought a house. 
The current issue is that he needs to know every little thing that I did during the break up. I was single, I dated, I had sex, I did what single people do. I did tell him who I slept with and now he stalks them (not maliciously - but still) online. I refuse to tell him anything more than that now. I don’t even want to know details of what he did when we were apart. I just want the past firmly behind us and move forward and be happy. 
After a couple of talks now about the breakup and the people I spent time with during the break up and seeing the grudge holding and resentful attitude start to creep back I’m feeling very anxious. He shamed me for my choices and for even discussing our breakup with friends. I’m honestly starting to spiral worrying about him digging up boyfriends from decades ago before we even met. I wasn’t an angel when I was younger and the one time he ran into someone I dated I introduced them and they shook hands and afterwards I mentioned that we had dated and he STILL brings it up. That I made him look like an idiot shaking the guys hand like that. That’s why I’m terrified of giving him details about my past at all.

This was a time when all my closest friends were leaving to college. I think I had issues with not having someone with me. I thought I need someone to complete me when I was already whole.

When we met, everything was great but I knew something was wrong. She would get intensely mad about things that I would do little things. I realized this when we at a party and this drunk girl started dancing with me. The drunk girl would get close I'd clearly backed away. The drunk girl spilled a drink on her so understand my girls frustration but she treated it as if it were my fault. I didn't 

Shes overly emotional. Nothing wrong with being emotional. But shes unaware of how this is affecting people around her.

Im not sunshine and rainbows either. I'm overly critical of her. Judging her. I get that from my parents. Definitely need to unlearn that behavior. My resentment is manifesting into anger. Anytime she ask me simple questions, its irritating. I take it out her and on others who do not deserve it. I plan on get therapy in 2020.

126,"I used to think of overeating as a totally isolated thing. Just a bad habit that I needed to break. After some introspection, I've realized that it's just one more strategy on my big list of unhealthy coping strategies.

When I become stressed and anxious I just totally shut down. The following are the aspects of ""shutting down"" that I have identified. 

* I choose to overeat junk food
* I stop trying to manage my environment (I won't do the dishes or tidy up)
* I won't go to bed and don't get enough sleep
* I forget to take my medication due to lack of self-care
* I zone out in front of a game or the TV or YouTube as a form of escape
* I cut off socially and avoid people or any kind of human interaction

As a result of these things, this is what happens.

* I gain weight
* My house becomes an embarrassing cluttered mess
* I feel tired at work, which leads to frustration
* I get withdrawal symptoms from my meds
* Any depression, anxiety or stress grows in intensity.

Clearly this is a flawed system that just keeps repeating itself. I feel anxious and stressed -&gt; I go to my broken coping strategies -&gt; I feel even more anxious and stressed. I'm trying to come up with a list of positive coping strategies that don't result in me digging myself into a deeper hole. Coming up with this list seems very easy to me. I can immediately think of things that will make me feel calm and put me in a better headspace.

* Put on some relaxing music
* Change into something comfortable
* Make a cup of tea
* Write in my journal and do some CBT
* Light a candle
* Do some meditation

127,"For clarification, I'm not saying that I have OCD because I have not be medically diagnosed as such. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and am on medication and have access to mental health services.

I go into these random ""attacks"" (for lack of a better term) where I must clean, organize, scrub, wash, organize more. It brings me relief and feelings of control because of some terrible experiences I had a year ago involving a temporary housing situation. I now live on my own with my parrot (messy guy gives me plenty to clean). I must run the dishwasher as soon as I can and leaving the sink full or with stuff in it I can tolerate (likely due to the medicine) but it will bring on an ""attack"" sooner or so it feels.

I also obsessively check my security cameras for fear of theft, intruders, and privacy. This obsession is also formed from experiences I've had.

I've learned not to trust people in general. Because of theft and deception.

I've been driven to clean obsessively and live alone because of several verbally and emotionally abusive roommates. Followed by a landlord who refused to help me with hazardous conditions that kept getting worse, forcing me to leave eventually.

I've become paranoid from witnessing horrible human behaviors, hearing about even worse behaviors and crimes regularly, and being assaulted in a park as a child.

These behaviors consume immense amount of time and energy. However... I feel pleasure from my cleanliness and my environment control. Is that normal? I feel safe with my security tendencies as well... I know it's obsessive behavior and potentially unhealthy but why do I not want to lose these coping mechanisms? I never want to abandon my current obsessive behaviors. I live a comfortable and fortunate life despite everything above and an learning to love everyday of my life more than the last.

Im not trying to glorify obsessive compulsive disorder as a desirable thing for clarification. I just feel as though (especially after reading all this) that I may have OCD... And I may not want it to change..

I've recently committed myself pretty well to losing weight, quitting smoking and drinking, writing in the novel I've always convinced myself I wasn't smart enough to do, saving money, and undoing the damage that I have created to others and myself while fighting my afflictions. However when my mental health dips still I have recently adopted some coping mechanisms that still stifle my life. For example, lately when I'm feeling depressed I've started spending money on pointless things causing myself more anguish once I realize that I'm just putting myself behind instead of sticking with saving money. I'm also still doing the bare minimum to get by when I get depressed stopping all work on my self-growth and productive hobbies in order to lay in bed whenever I'm not working. I've stopped treating the people I care about shitty when im depressed, yet when im anxious I still do. Also when I'm really anxious I start smoking and if its especially bad drinking again. I understand I'm still on a journey to get better and I know these issues won't ever disappear; however, if y'all have any advice for how to remove these coping mechanisms and/or replace them with things that are healthier/more productive for my physical/emotional health and my ability to live a more productive life I would love to hear them and would appreciate it greatly! Thank you!

TL:DR Dude has bad coping mechanisms, do you have any ideas for cancelling them or replacing them with better coping mechanisms",09Jan2020,1
131,"Again, like last time when telling my mom I need legitimate help for my mental health she gets pissed and loses her cool. 

I raise my voice for her to stop blabbing on about how she struggled in the past n she tells me I'm yelling and being abusive. How is it abuse to fucking tell my parent, the one who said I could go and talk if I'm not safe that I need help? 

I never laid a finger on her, wouldn't dream of it in a million years. I always put on a show to help her, swallowed my pride because she told me ""If I'm happy then shes happy."" 

I'm not in the right frame of mind to go to the hospital by myself, calling the cops would cause more of a panic and scene then needed but I seriously cant fucking do this shit anymore. 

Stop playing the victim card, stop acting like your teenage son can solve your problems and be your therapist. 

Shes counting my medication right now and starting to take them away even though I'm not abusing them/taking more than needed. Hell I'm not even cutting deep anymore I just dont trust myself I'm not safe. 

But hey, I'm the bad guy right?

Not a love letter to myself:

I want to be better. In any sense of the word really. But, “better” seems vague and objective now that I put it into words. Writing this feels like some sort of detached way to talk to myself. I don’t have many people to talk to these days. Maybe I should break it down? That seems logical… and potentially helpful. 

So, make *what* better, I guess… my outlook on my body for one thing. People often say that your internal narrative should be like that of a loving mother…I am very good at mothering others, not so much myself. Its like no matter what I’m never reaching the potential I think I have. I have these bars high or low and nothing ever seems to help overcome them I just keep surrounding myself with more mental obstacles until I just turn around and go home. 

I get so discouraged to the point of lethargy. Working out is fulfilling, but… not seeing results is devastating. I want to be the best version of myself I can be. Accepting my body for what it is… is so hard because I have always hated it. Even at my skinniest I was so insecure, but losing that weight gave me a sense of confidence I had never felt before. I know I’m not fat. I know that. But body dysmorphia is a powerful horrible thing and I can’t help but be disgusted when I look in a mirror. It has always been that way ever since I was young, and I started to get my little pudge of a belly. 

My mother was obese. My whole life she was just a very large, vain, look obsessed, neurotic woman. She has her problems, I know. But she projected her own insecurities about her weight onto her unassuming, and undeserving child from such a young age. My mother always thought back to her younger years when she was bright skinny and beautiful. But never about the present. 

She would tell me I was pretty. But she would also ask me if I had to use the bathroom when my stomach looked bloated. I only wore high waisted pants growing up because I feared the ridicule of my tiny tummy. I wore tank tops almost religiously creating layers between me and the world.  I remember wanting so badly to have a flat stomach. 

I still do.

I just always feel as if I’m never quite in the present. Like my life isn’t my own so trying to accomplish any goals I have seems impossible. Start small? Build up from there, even if you have failed you will have created a few new building blocks build for when you start again. I know. I’m just a defeatist at heart. And its hard. 

I can’t write a love letter to myself. I don’t know how to genuinely feel that way. 

I want, to be someone that helps people. But I’m afraid of having my own voice. My insecurities and anxiety make me feel small and unable to even imagine people listening to a word I have to say. Helping people understand their own bodies and minds. Letting others know they aren’t alone. Being able to give people the tools they need to become the best versions of themselves. I want to do that for others. Why can’t I do that for myself?

Why can I support body positivity but hate my own so greatly? 

Its like my whole life is this giant artist block but it’s just me, in the way of myself. 

I want to stop feeling sorry. I apologize for merely existing almost every day. And it has to stop. I deserve to be here, to be happy, to love myself.",09Jan2020,1

134,"My hobby is photography, so I take photos of pretty much everything when I'm outside. Very often, I find myself looking at old photos I took this Spring and Summer and I feel very bittersweet. I really miss those times, I think about good memories a lot . I still have a nice life, I consider myself a happy person, but everything was just better during the Spring and Summer. Not just ""visually"", so to speak, but mentally as well.

Listening to my favourite songs and looking at those pictures is a ""fatal"" combination, lol. Sometimes I cry, sometimes I laugh, sometimes both. I didn't get diagnosed by a professional, but I probably have Seasonal Affective Disorder. Leaving that aside, why am I feeling so nostalgic over good times that happened recently? Another thing some people may find odd is that I made most of those memories spending time alone. I have memories with friends as well, but I think about the ones where I was alone most of the time.

135,"Hello,
I am sorry if this is long. Please go easy on me as well, I’m feeling extremely self-conscious. 
I’m in my first year of university. Last night I decided to go out with a couple guy friends (I’m 19M), two of whom I just met before we left (they were mutual friends of one of the guy friends who invited me). I was told the place we were going to was a bar, but when I got there, it was more of a club. Anyways, we all aren’t exactly sober. We sat at a booth, got some drinks, and one of the mutual friends was saying how we should all try to pick up some girls for the night. I didn’t exactly hear what he said, so my one friend told him that I have a girlfriend (which is true). The two mutual friends were sort of lightly pressuring me to cheat, and I would not budge, as I politely turned that idea down. (Side note: I have absolutely no tolerance for cheaters. It’s super messed up to do that to another person). Anyways, we went to the dance floor and I’m dancing (horribly) with one of the mutual friends and we get in this group of other girls and whatever, nothing eventful... I obviously was not trying to hook up with anyone. Was just trying to make some friends. Now, I obviously know that going to clubs is where people want to hookup, but I guess I didn’t fully realize how frequent of an occurrence that was. So a little while later My friends and I are walking back up to the bar, and I’m kind of trailing behind, and one of them sees a group of girls that he knows. So I get into the little circle, and I just introduce myself or whatever. Now, I’m usually TERRIBLE at reading if someone is interested in me (i guess I’m just extremely oblivious, also I’ve had my girlfriend for three years now) but this one girl was clearly making advances towards me, and if I was able to pick up on that, there was no way it wasn’t true. Anyways, she starts dancing near me, and I kind of just start doing the same thing, and within 15 seconds of that, she turns around and starts grinding. I’m caught off guard, so I slowly start backing up. To get her to turn around, I tell her my name, which would kind of incline her to turn around and tell me her name (I guess This was my thought process. I wasn’t sober, and I wasn’t in my prime decision-making state). It worked though, and she turned around (which was the goal). She told her her name and She was touching me, grabbing me by the arm, all that. I somehow slipped away from this situation within a minute of her turning around (I can’t even remember how I did it to be honest. I wasn’t absolutely wasted, I was still in control of myself, I just don’t remember that detail). 
So I ended up leaving the club as soon as I could without straight up ditching the guys I went with. I probably left around 20 minutes after it happened, which was the first opportunity I saw to leave. Wasn’t feeling very good. I got home, and called my girlfriend and I told her the general story. She offered to come over (we both live on campus residence so its very close) and so she stayed the night and I told her more of the details of the story. She told me that I should have straight up told the girl at the beginning as soon as she started dancing near me that I have a girlfriend. At that point however, I wasn’t fully certain she was trying to hit on me, and I didn’t want to immediately say “oh I have a girlfriend” and just leave. I thought maybe not every girl in this club is looking for a hookup (I guess that’s where my naivety comes into play?). I was really tired (I couldn’t even keep my eyes open) and I wanted to go to bed, but my girlfriend was super upset. I was trying to comfort her, while also feeling really self-conscious myself, on top of not being in a sober state. So yeah that didn’t go very well. It’s tense between the two of us right now, and I was just trying to do the right thing. In general, I felt very socially awkward during many parts of the night, and out of place, and I felt like everyone was staring at me nitpicking every little thing I did or didn’t do. I just need some reassurance or something, anything. I have had depression and anxiety in the past, and I’m now medicated for it. But in extreme situations (like this one) my depressed and anxious tendencies seem to surface.

136,"I HATE those up and downs. I'd rather be down all the time than this fake good feeling in between bad times. Then I could decide to just not give a fuck anymore.  
But because of those fucking annoying ""good"" times I am scared to really screw up anything.  
Right now I am feeling shitty again but I know, if I do something dumb like drinking or hurting myself (which I would LOVE to do right now), I will regret it tomorrow when I feel like this shit is not as worse as it was yesterday.  
I will feel like maybe there is hope, maybe I could do something good with my life. I will even feel a little bit of motivation to do something.  
I just want to destroy myself without my mind switching around all the time.

137,"I talk about positive symptoms of schizophrenia all the time... and negative ones some of the time. But I almost never talk about the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia and my experiences with them.

139,"Has anyone else dealt with the problem of “just starting” something? As in you have to start something like a project or a poem and no matter how many times someone says “just start by saying...” or “just start by talking about...” you just can’t do it? 

I’m not sure if it’s tied to my ADHD or my DPDR but I cannot just do things I don’t think I know as much as others do. And it’s to the point of failing classes and losing friends.

For instance I didn’t think I would make a hockey team so I literally refused to go inside and even watch them tryout. I sat outside crying until the end of tryouts. 

Or when I had made a basketball team and I knew how to play defense but then the coaches switched me to offense and I had a meltdown.

It’s not even about laziness or me just not wanting to do something, it’s like I can’t physically or mentally get myself to do it without knowing ever single little piece of how something works and I’ll obsess over it until I can get to that point.

140,"Hello everyone. I am 16 and I have decided to make a special project to help people in my school, especially younger people. 
In my country, mental health is not talked about at all, and even when it is talked about, not a single time has my school offered something which truly would show students how it’s okay to not be okay and that people with mental health disorders don’t have to be treated different or judged since we’re all humans and we should all get treated without prejudice. 
I decided because of this to make a documentary as a school project where I’m going to interview people from my country, as well as all over the world that have mental disorders and just have a normal conversation with them and try to humanize the idea of having a disorder. This would then closely related to something I am looking to implement in my school which would help students feel more comfortable about reaching out for help when they need it. 
What I need is people from all over the world who are willing to be interviewed by me about their lives, their disorder, but mainly just about them. I truly believe that if students here see that a mental disorder isn’t something to be ashamed of or even struggling with mental health isn’t something that should stay hidden. I hope this project will help someone out there and I’d really appreciate all the help I could get. 

If you have any questions, which I’m sure I do since I feel I wasn’t very clear about some things, you can leave a comment and I’ll try to reply.

144,"Hey, guys.

New(ish) to Reddit but finding it a fantastic resource.

I’ve been in a down spiral for around four months due to several circumstances. I think my only resort at this point is going in patient. I can’t take care of myself. I‘m honestly too tired to even explain any of it. I’m not here for advice on that end of things. I’m having trouble even speaking because I’m so tired. I’ve been catatonic and it’s all too much.

What I’m looking for is experiences, advice, etc. on inpatient. Whether it’s actually going to help. I did have one previous hospitalization (voluntary). They wanted me for at least 3 weeks after seeing my trauma history but it was a religious hospital and a public ward and they were horrible. I only made it 3 days before signing myself back out. They gave me meds but those meds cost ~$500 a month without insurance so lmao.

I have insurance now through my boyfriend. But I’m unsure as to how anything works out financially because I can’t even take care of my personal hygiene right now, let alone be part of the work force.

I’m increasingly suicidal, more so than I’ve ever been in my life. My mom has Munchausen’s by proxy (yes, like Gypsy Rose’s mom, very similar case). So I’ve been pretty suicidal since I was very young. But it’s different now. I’m at a loss. I have a plan, and I was always told if you have a plan that you need to get help ASAP. But I’m so scared of the financial strain this would cause my partner and I. We’re already in a horribly tight spot and i know how expensive hospitalization is.

So, I guess:

1. Have you been inpatient? What was your experience?
2. What should I know before I go?
3. Is inpatient helpful?
4. How much did it cost for you? What was the process like with the insurance company? What was your copay?

I guess this is more a question for the Americans. Probably wouldn’t make much sense to somebody who has health care covered nationally, tbh.",09Jan2020,1
145,"I’ve never been one to focus on dating. Growing up I was never very good at making friends and being part of the social system so I occupied myself occupied with my academics and other professional development type  things .

So long as I’m focusing on my work I feel somewhat at peace, but it’s a fragile peace because the moment my mind drifts to those parts of my life that I don’t focus on, relationships, friendships, etc etc, my mind floods with stress and anxiety, feelings of self loathing, the idea that I’ve never been good enough and never will be good enough  completely dominates my thinking and any self worth I might have from how good at school I am goes out the window, I’m nothing, garbage . I enter a very bad and very distressed emotional state. I essentially avoid this by shunning this part of my mind, focusing on what I’m good at and what I can control.

I have been noticing for the past year and a half that I am terrified of being stalked/attacked/kidnapped when I go outside. It used to be at all times, and even inside, but has improved and I mainly only experience this when it is dark outside now. It will prevent me from going outside when it is dark. This is a problem because I am at work from about 730am-4pm and I am a full-time online student for my Masters. I love working out and have found that I will actually go to the gym and get a good workout in if I go around 5:30am. However, it is dark outside and I have to walk about 30 seconds to get to my car in the parking lot. I almost did not even go to the gym today. I do not want my fear to get in the way of what I want to do. Sometimes I feel like an idiot because I have a Bachelors degree in Psychology and I'm working towards a Masters in School Counseling. I'm aware that my fear is rational, in that it is normal to fear this, but I know it is irrational to fear this so much that it doesn't allow me to do certain things (I avoid doing other things I have not mentioned but aren't as important, but I REALLY want to continue working out before work). I want to try to work on this myself first before I seek out therapy - because I am unsure if insurance will cover this. I have pepper spray and am thinking of learning self-defense. 

Thoughts I experience when I have to walk outside in the dark: What if someone IS out there? What if someone has been following me? What if someone knows that I am going to leave my apartment at this time? What will I do if someone does attack me? Even if I pepper spray them? How can I get to my car fast while still being completely aware of what is around me? Maybe I should just stay home. I can't let this control me. But what if it does happen? 

I also experience an elevated heart-rate and am on high alert. I am very good at controlling my breath but it does not seem to actually help when trying to cope. I keep battle rational vs. irrational thoughts but it's hard to determine which ones are rational sometimes. 

Once I am outside and I think the coast is clear, I've made sure I have my belongings in a good position and I walk really fast while looking all around me. I try to be quiet so that hopefully no one would notice me. Once I get to my car I get in as fast as I can and lock the doors once I am inside. Once I am inside my car, I am extremely relieved but also I feel like I shouldn't feel this way.

Hurt. Confused

He never thought he would want to kill himself. He thought about it every now and then, but he never actually wanted to do that. 

One day, he woke up at 10am. It was a cloudy day. The sky was dark. For some reasons, he felt different. Everything was annoying. Everything was a distraction. The sounds. The piles of clothes. The opened closets. The blanket. Himself. He wanted to be out of that place. There was something inside him trying to tell him something, but he couldn’t hear it. He knew it was important, but he couldn’t hear it. He sat on his bed for 30 minutes trying to think, but his mind was blank. At a moment, he decided he would kill himself that day. He texted his therapist about what was happening, but his therapist didn’t answer. That was it. He - a 17 year old - would kill himself.

He knew everything was. Knives. Electric cords. Right. He knew where his meds were. He wanted to take his pills, go out to his trail, and commit suicide there so nobody could stop him. It would give him enough time.

He prepared for his death. Wrote some notes for people he loved. Wore his favorite leather jacket. He slowly walked to the room where his meds were. Every step had to be completely quiet. Nothing could stop him today. 

There was someone in the room where his meds were. She said Hi to him and smiled, asking him where he was going. He was disappointed that he couldn’t get the meds. 

He received a text from one of his friends. It gave him goosebumps. It was very sincere. It stirred his emotions a little bit. He thought she would be really hurt if he was gonna commit suicide, and he couldn’t let that happen because she was very important to him. She was his first love, his ex- girlfriend. Though he didn’t love her like he was, she still had a very important place in his heart.  

He walked out of the house. It started to rain. He was very confused about what he was going to do next, because he didn’t have his pills, so he couldn’t kill himself as planned. He walked slowly to his favorite trail. On the way, his therapist called him, and talked him through the suicidal thoughts. He decided to not kill himself anymore. 

He reached his favorite spot. The grass there was dying because of the cold, and it had a yellowish color that he really hated. He sat down and called the friend. They talked for a bit about… stuff. He finally felt better and decided to walk back home. It was raining very hard, and there was thunder and lightning. He thought he was stupid for being out that day. When he reached home, he was soaking wet.

….

….

Hurt. Anger.

He hates it when people say: “Don’t kill yourself. You have to be alive for us. Don’t be selfish”. He hates it. Hates it. Hates it. Hates it. Hates it. Yes. Everyone has good intentions, but they should just shut up. No one listens. 

He considers himself not a selfish dick. He does think about other people. He cares about other people. He loves to help other people. Whenever he thinks about killing himself, he thinks people will get hurt, and will be sad. He doesn’t want that. He just cannot help himself, but other people don’t think so. People want him “to live for them”. Do they ever think that he has to live for himself too? He just cannot live for himself. That’s why he wants to commit suicide. Is that selfish? 

….

….

….

Crave.

He craves physical contacts. He wants to hug someone. Someone. Enjoy the scent of the people. It’s been so long since the last time he hugged or cuddled someone. He missed the warmth of people. Here, he cannot cuddles anybody. Even the dog doesn’t like to be cuddled.

For some background-started seeking mental help a bit over a year ago. got an exam allowance on may for depression and anxiety, currently on an academic gap year for the same thing. Havent been officially updated on my diagnosis since then, which really bothers me. 
My psychiatrist has from time to time told me i have adhd and bpd as well. I am scared of not getting proper treatment and am put on new meds almost every month. Currently taking both Zoloft and Mirtazapine, Lorazepam and Xanax. I recently got taken off Phenibut, which i had to take 500mg of everyday. so it mustve built some sort of dependence? 
havent been feeling well. i dont know if its some sort of episode im undergoing, ive been feeling very overwhelmed hyperactive and irritated everyday for the past 2 weeks. i try to calm it down by taking xanax, which has been making me drowsy and sometimes making things worse than it already was. 
before that, in mid december i was feeling incredibly sad, worrying about everything. now i worry about me not being able to control my emotions. i spend most of the time in my room overthinking everything Ive said and done while trying to calm myself down. It feels like its getting harder and harder everyday. i used to leave the house everyday hanging out just because i couldnt stand still. 
I feel like i am slowly giving up on myself, and i am losing control of that. i am just confused and i want to know what to do.",09Jan2020,1
156,"My boyfriend and I got into a fight a couple of months ago. It was the first real argument we’ve had the 2 years we’ve been living together and we’ve been friends for 7. 

I opened up to my mom about it, which I normally don’t because she tends to over react and hold a grudge. But at the time, I thought we were breaking up. He wasn’t abusive but alcohol was involved and it was very dramatic. 

Fast forward to now, I’ve been relocated for work. She assumed it meant we were totally done. When I told her he was helping me move and that we weren’t calling it quits, she blocked my number. I got ahold of her today, she told me I was making a poor decision and that her life would be miserable without me but she didn’t want any part of it. 

I haven’t responded. I feel I should seek counseling, just wondering if anyone else has went through something similar because this is breaking my heart.",09Jan2020,1

159,A friend of mine who has a history of depression had a panic attack and was taken to the ER. She was then taken to a mental health facility and has been there for 10 days now and doesn't know when she'll be out. She hopes soon. She explained a little to me but talking on the phone is limited. Seems like something more than a panic attack is going on here but I'm very inexperienced in this area. Does anyone have any idea or experience and could recommend what may be happening or what may have happened to lead to this? What she is telling me doesn't make sense but she said they took her from the ER to the mental facility in an ambulance and they didn't tell her. She also fought when she got there because she didn't want to go and was given a shot. Thanks!,09Jan2020,1

161,"Someone once told me that I should stop talking or making conversations with people who make me uncomfortable or make my symptoms worse.  So, I stopped taking to my family.

163,"Hi all. I'm hoping someone here knows more about this than I do. I'll just start off by saying that maybe I'm just an introvert. But I really loathe some of these things. I loathe them and think about them negatively to the point that it made me want to ask here. I hate crowds, I won't go to concerts. If there's a large crowd I'm getting out of it immediately. I don't like people I don't know standing too close to me, and I really don't like them to walk up and talk to me. Unless the conversation just somehow happens organically. I'm getting better about that through force of will though. Not as bad as I used to be. But I'd just really rather not. Not talk to most people

I enjoy spending time with my friends and to some degree, my family. And I'll spend time with them. But people I don't know... I just don't really like them talking to me much. I am married but even still, I prefer to spend most of my time alone, sitting in front of my computer. I work as a truck driver, so that my contact with random people that I don't care to associate with, is as limited as it can be. I'm even building a website that I intend to monetize, so that I can eventually quit working and stay home in my house away from the world and away from people, as much as possible. I really don't care what it takes, I'll learn everything there is to know about marketing if that's what I have to do. But I'm going to get out of this job and I'm going to work at home. 

Another thing is, I really dislike disorder. Like a lot. I want everything as orderly as possible. The house doesn't have to be spotless, don't get me wrong. But if there's stuff out and about, it's going to be orderly. I even order everything on the table if we go out to eat at a restaurant. I don't know if this next part has any bearing on anything, but I'm smart. I'm not some kind of braggart, I'm simply explaining this. I've taken a ton of tests over the years in an effort to remedy my social situation and my social anxiety. And most of the time I come out as being smarter than 98 out of 100 in a room full of people. With only 99 and 100 being smarter than me. I know there's no way to say that without it sounding like I'm tooting my own horn. But I said it because it's well known that a lot of ""eccentrics"" are that way. They're extremely talented in something or another, and they're also kind of weird as I am. I also feel that I don't have much in common with most people. A little here and there, sure. 

But by and large, I really do need to at least go to the local college and talk to the professors to feel like I'm in like minded company. I know the way this all sounds and I really can't stand people who talk like this but given what I'm trying to do here, I have to. So hopefully someone can take an objective look and tell me... I don't know. Something, anything. To get over myself, that I really do have condition x, whatever. But it's as though my wife is some kind of a social butterfly and I just can't wait to get away from people and back to my computer. I'm aware that it's a problem so I make it a point to go against it as much as I can tolerate, but even then I'm still just tolerating it. I don't like it, and I really don't want anything to do with it. Social situations, I mean. Other than with my little tight knit social circle. Anyway I've rambled on long enough about this, thanks for reading and I look forward to reading your reply.",09Jan2020,1
164,"Disregarding work/school (PhD Student), I spend most days having nothing more than passing interactions with cashiers and strangers. It's not uncommon to have a Saturday or Sunday where I don't utter a single word. Sometimes I play a video game online with a friend and we chat. When opportune, I engage in friendly conversations with peers. People do seem to like me and it's rather evident that many of the opposite gender find me attractive. Despite these things, I rarely interact socially and feel lonely. So my questions are: 1) how outlandish is this? 2) is there anything in the literature that speaks of an empirically determined healthy quantity of social interaction per day?

165,"So this is my first post ever and I'm not even sure it's on the appropriate channel, but I'm struggling pretty badly rn and i don't have any other ideas. 

I tried to open up and talk about my anxiety and constant mental exhaustion and unhappiness to my girlfriend last night. It was quite late and this urge to talk came spontaneously. I don't usually share these feelings, because I don't want it to be a burden on anyone or make them feel like they're supposed to make some undue effort on my behalf. Nor is there anyone around that cares that much tbh. Anyway, I told her about this constant noise that goes on in my head and how I'm tired of it and want it to stop so i can get some rest and hear myself think for a change. I feel crushed by the world and it's all emotional lead and constant hyperstimulation. No energy, no perspective, barely any enjoyment. Just muck and buzzing noises.  It's all so melodramatic-sounding and I know there's not much people can say or do to ""fix"" you like through magic, but I thought I could trust her with my weakness and just have somebody to show some solidarity for once and just not feel alone in this. Well, she probably didn't realize it but she shut me down in a really crappy way, like ""oh that's too bad I'd love to help but I'm really sleepy now,  so I'll go to sleep"". Well, ouch.. and it only goes to reinforce my belief that i shouldn't bother people with my crap and push them away by being a needy baby. But jesus holy christ i feel exactly like a needy baby right now, and the one person i was hoping would show some warmth did exactly the opposite. I'm super upset and i feel betrayed and pushed away like refuse, especially since i did my very best at all times to be there for her when she had her moments. I can't tell her how i feel because it'll make her feel guilty, she's a super kind person when it's an obvious situation, but struggles with empathy when it comes to many things about me. I needed to let this one out to someone, because otherwise I'd end up letting it out to myself and that means ending up in some destructive situation sooner or later.

177,"So I just took a 29 question survey that was supposed to help me get to know myself better. Didn't work, and honestly I'm a little depressed by my answers.

What activity in your life lights you up with joy? Eating


What is something you always love doing, even when you are tired or rushed? Why? Eating. I know I will feel better even if only for a little bit. Nothing else brings me that feeling.


If a relationship or job makes you unhappy, do you choose to stay or leave? Leave. Or sabotage it so that they leave.


What do you fear about leaving a bad job or a bad relationship? The unknown, how I'm going to pay bills. Also what I'm going to do in my spare time.


What do you believe is possible for you? Nothing.


What have you done in your life that you are most proud of? Nothing.


What is the thing that you are second most proud of? Nothing.


What kind of legacy do you want to leave behind? Honestly I don't give a shit. I don't think I can control what other people think so why care?


How does your being here in the universe change humanity for the better? It doesn't.


If you could have one single wish granted, what would it be? Go back to being a child with the knowledge I have now.


How comfortable are you with your own mortality? Not.


What is your highest core value? How the fuck should I know?


To your best knowledge, how do other people perceive you? They hate me, or barely tolerate me.


How would you like others to perceive you? I wish they'd value my presence.


How confident are you in your abilities to make decisions for yourself? Not, I can't seem to make a decision and when I do I always second guess it.


What is your biggest self-limiting belief? I don't know.


Who is the most important person in your life? My mom.


Who is your greatest role model? I don't have one. No one around me actually shared anything real so I have no one to look up to that isn't fake as shit.


Who is a person that you don’t like yet you spend time with? Kevin. His obsession with serial killers and slasher movies is disturbing to me.


What is something that is true for you no matter what? I will try to find a way to connect with whoever I'm talking to even if I have nothing in common with them.


What is your moral compass in making difficult decisions? How will it benefit me?


What is one failure that you have turned into your greatest lesson? I haven't.


What role does gratitude play in your life? *Shrug*


How do you feel about your parents? Dad was a fucking waste of air, mom let her own shit get in the way of raising me.


How is your relationship with money? I wish I had more of it.


How do you feel about growing old someday? Indifferent.


What role has formal education played in your life and how do you feel about it? None, and I think it's a waste of time for most people.


Do you believe your destiny is pre-determined or in your hands to shape however you wish? I think it's subject to the myriad whims and fancies of random people in the world who somehow are in positions of power.


What do you believe is the meaning of your life? To fuck off.


What do you think?",09Jan2020,1
178,"I'm so worried and don't know what to do, I feel like my mental health is ruining my relationship with my girlfriend. 

We both have mental health issues and neither of us are particularly well.... I crave affection and long to have people want to do things with me. But my partner is so exhausted from recently going back to work that all she wants to do is go on her phone after work. 

I am the kind of person who just loves human contact, but recently a lot of the time she doesn't want to cuddle or do things together, There isn't any doubt in the fact she loves me and often says she wants to spend the rest of her life with me. My problem is with my negative self image I worry that asking for things constantly like cuddles and kisses pushes her into doing it when she doesn't really want to. So I wait round for her to want to do it or ask me, but she very rarely does. So I worry that she feels like I'm going cold because I'm not offering as much as I used to, but in actual fact I'm dying for her to offer or just do these things.

Do I sound nyeive or selfish? I just think I need to be told straight.

181,"Hey ya'll. 

Was hoping anyone with any type of input could share. 

I've been struggling with intense cognitive brain fog for about a year now. Some other symptoms include:

\- Declining memory/recall

\- Lack of concentration...finding it tough to stay on certain tasks

\- Struggle to feel present in conversations

\- Lack of excitement...not enjoying things as I used to because of being afraid of how I'm going to feel.   
  Not feeling present during these things..always in my own mind

\- Lack of comprehending/retaining things I've read

\- Lack of clarity

\- Lack of emotion

**A little background:**

I  accepted a job in Oct of 2018 &amp; moved to Colorado in December of 2018 from the Midwest. Something I've always wanted to do and feel like I should be thriving because I finally accomplished it; but the brain fog and other symptoms make it nearly impossible to enjoy myself. I used to be one of the most outgoing people I knew &amp; loved life, but I'm just not feeling myself anymore. Struggle to put myself into social settings because of being in my own mind thinking about how I'm feeling. Always analyzing myself.

Work is going great...although the brain fog definitely impacts my ability at work. But overall the job is going well. I do stare at a computer screen nearly all day, but I did it quite often at my prior place of employment. &amp; I'm making good money which allowed me to move out here. 

Used to be a cannabis user, now it makes these symptoms 100x worse. Drinking alcohol makes it worse. Working out, which I do roughly 4 times a week, makes it worse. &amp; all of these things stink because they were part of who I was/am.

I got a primary care doc after moving out here. I've seen him 3 times now. At first he thought it was anxiety because of the move &amp; also had a tragic family death right before moving out here. However, when I think back, these symptoms started in November of 2018; before the family tragedy &amp; before moving out here, but after accepting the job. I pretty much just ignored them because of how stoked I was to be moving...but they are no long ignore-able &amp; are impacting my daily life. 

After I told the doc I didn't feel like it was anxiety, he said it could be minor ADHD &amp; prescribed me a super low dose of ritalin. Symptoms have still been there, if not worse. I definitely have symptoms of depression, but I cannot tell if the symptoms are a result of the brain fog/cognitive problems I am having or if they are causing them. It's like which came first...the chicken or the egg. I really have no reason to be depressed other than having these issues, which is the part that kills me. As I said, I'm finally doing something I've wanted to do my entire life. Have a great job with a lot of opportunity. Should be thriving...but these things are just limiting me in every aspect of my life.

I eat healthy, workout, &amp; am overall an intelligent individual. But these things are starting to make me feel like I'm not intelligent &amp; have a lack of social skills, which is not my personality at all. I've always been outgoing &amp; have LOVED meeting new people. But these things are dragging me down.

I've got my first appointment with a counselor tomorrow...but I'm worried he will just assume I'm depressed &amp; want to get me on depression meds. I'm not dead opposed, anything that will make this better, but I'm just afraid that's not the case &amp; that its a cognitive issue. Thinking about seeing a neurologist.

Sorry for typing a book....I just was talking to my mother earlier today &amp; she suggested making a post on here to see what input I get back. I'm super open minded and will seriously take any suggestions/considerations to heart. Willing to try anything and everything to get back to being myself; An outgoing, personable, excited, happy person.

Thanks, all.",09Jan2020,1
182,"
""Call my dad!,"" ""Please call my dad!,"" ""I cannot, not right now, we need to get you to the hospital."" I remember the day, it was sunny, working with one of my best friends. Stand by fire! Excited, usually one of those calls that we get to stand there and hope no one gets hurt. 

As we were en route, we started to receive updates via our truck computer… house on fire, neighbors state its an abandoned house, I remember telling my partner ""oh, another one."" Next update, neighbors report there's a man on fire walking down the street. Our jaws drop, we hoped it wasn't right, or some feeble attempt to get the fire department there faster. 

I remember turning the corner and seeing him. He stood on the corner silent, not waving his hands, not yelling, not doing anything but standing there. Still smoldering, naked, all of his hair was gone, anything to make him recognizable gone — just a human figure standing there. His eyes matched the neighbors who witnessed the event, wider then I have ever seen. ""Am I going to die?""… ""not now""….. ""call my dad""…. ""not now""... What else could I say to him? The 23-year-old has suffered more burns than I have seen on some dead people, and yet he was talking to me. 

“What happened?”

""They said if I told anyone they would do this to each of my family members..."" Silence. ""Tell us something before you pass out."" 

En route to the hospital, we did everything we could do for him. We gave him medications, started IVs, called the hospital, and let them know we were coming and get everyone to the trauma bay. We arrived at the hospital and started our update... 23 y/o male … ""He's dead"" The doctor said. I couldn't even get through my report, and the doctor took a 4 ft away assessment and told us he was dead. ""He's still talking sir"" I remember uttering back. ""It doesn't matter; he is dead or is going to be."" He then went on to explain that he had full-thickness burns 100% of his body, and there was nothing they could do but delay death. Three nurses then left the room, crying. 

I remember walking out of the room with tears building in my own eyes. I stood outside the room for a moment to gather myself and remember overhearing the social worker talking on the phone, ""get here now sir, I know you're busy, but this is urgent."" She laid down the phone, knowing she couldn't tell him what had happened, just that he needed to be there, now with his dying son. 

This is just one of the hundreds of people that live now in my memories. They may not show up every day, but they do show up. I find that certain events trigger these people back into the images in my mind, regressed is some dark place. Things like a house fire or ""Call my dad"" bring them back. I re-live it like I was there, what could I have done differently? Maybe if I... has replayed hundreds of times in my head. In school, I was told not to burden any of the blame when people die because of their own poor decisions; however, what was never taught is it is impossible to be a compassionate human being and not burden any fault when a person dies.

As Paramedics, EMTs, Dispatchers, Firefighters, and Police Officers, we are faced with more trauma in one week than most people will see in their lifetime. 

What's the worse thing you have seen? That's a famous line at every family gathering. Well, welcome back to all the people living in that repressed dark lace in my head. Some of them are the unspoken ones, the ones you don't want to talk about. The kid being sexually and mentally assaulted by the live-in boyfriend. The elderly man that died months ago, but the family needed to live off his checks, the young mother who just lost her life in an MVA surrounded by her family, while the children escaped relatively unharmed. Yet still, only the tip of the iceberg. 

The phone rang, ""are you ready for in-service?"". No, I want to go and hug my family and tell them that I love them, I want to be anywhere but here right now focused on the kid who was dying in the other room, waiting for his father to come to the hospital. Most of all, I want just a minute to think about what just happened, decompress, gather myself, and talk about what I just saw. ""In-service,"" "" ok, you got one"" onto the next call. 

It's part of the job. That's old school thinking, and it's time for a change. Years ago, we used not to wear gloves either, and doctors used to smoke while assessing patients, we have since found out that wasn’t the best idea, and learned from that. Now it's time to change the way that we also treat mental health with first responders. Mental health is just as if not more important than physical health. 

Cleveland EMS is broken, Cleveland Public Safety is broken. It used to be a respected profession. Now we are spit on... When we try and go to administration with concerns, we are spit on by them. It's almost impossible to go home healthy after that. I couldn't do it. I wasn't strong enough, and bless those who are. The City of Cleveland broke me, and I had to leave to try and fix me.

The City of Cleveland has thousands of public safety workers. They make them wear things like ballistic vests, turnout jackets, and helmets to protect them physically. However, they do not want to protect them mentally. In 13 years, I have seen more people die due to suicide than due to a line of duty death, yet this is a non-issue for the city. Suicide is the final event that is a culmination of many events, yet that is when the city acknowledges that person. Those deaths fall directly on your inactions to address the issues. Every day I say a prayer to help those who help you, and hope today wasn't their last.

183,"Hey there folks. I'm not coming here to moan either to find someone to tap me on my back. I just want to know others point of view, since i have noticed long time ago - my own gets adjusted to the proper or ""mainstream"" thinking when most people agree on the same thing. So please help me with your opinion folks.

So why i say i'm a ""disabled millenial""? Well i'm almost 25, doing quite well with work, fixed my social life (i was an antisocial pothead, which made me lazy and made matters worse, as of now half a year passed since i smoked for the last time) and in general i do quite well with my life goals, whatever i really want i always work hard to get it either material or not - in fact i owe a lot to my parents, they taught me most of the good life rules. BUT. There is a big but.

I get to the point in my life when i am thinking of having my own family, but... it's sad to say i'm single for most of my life, i can total the time of all relationships at around a month (i'm serious). They always ended as in the country i grew up i was a ""tanned foreigner"" (i'm from one country but i grew up somewhere else, where ""latinos"" are called by n-word, i know tell me about it) and racism was a big thing, then gossiping and in the end me trying multiple times and hearing then what they said and thought of me made me literally deny all actions in that case. And in the end the last girl i got into the relationship with (actually in third country now, but it was already more than 5 years ago) everything was fine and i could be a well-doing thing till today, but i was a smoker at the time and i was being a really silent/closed up person because ""i don't know what she will think/say"" and it all ruined it few weeks later. 

That's why i say i'm disabled as i found out, finding out a partner in 21st century is actually treated as disability. Haha more reasons to make me smile about the whole thing, i am not sarcastic, i seriously laugh at this, but sometimes it gets me in a depression state, but just sometimes.

 So in general even though i show a lot of interest, i always fear to make a move. I admit, i am scared of rejection it makes me fear to make a move. So my time is passing, and i am also scared i might go down the old route of ""i don't give a damn, because i'm on my own"". So what can i do to possibly change this?",09Jan2020,1
184,"I think I may or may not have anorexia. You see, this past couple of months, I’ve been eating less and less. I have been trying to motivate myself to eat more, but it isn’t working. Since usually I just start laying on my bed and not getting up for hours and it’s been affecting my health. But the thing is that I believe that usually, anorexia is on purpose, deliberately trying to eat less to lose weight. However, I don't have that mindset. Does anyone have any idea what is going on with me and if so maybe share some advice? I’m also thinking that it might be depression, but I’m not sure. And I apologize if the thing that I'm looking for is right in front of me,  but my family never talked about mental health so it's pretty new to me.",09Jan2020,1

186,"So my brother died in 2017 of brain cancer (aged 26) I was 21.

He was diagnosed with brain cancer New year's Eve 2013.
He had 1 round of radio therapy and 2 rounds of chemo. 

We were extremely close, closer than most brothers I'd say. We had a pretty poor start to life, I was a victim of emotional abuse/neglect and not being fed properly and  our mum was shagging pretty much everyone and my dad divorced her. we went into our grandparents care in 2002. We had a great upbringing there and when i was 11 in 2007 I moved in with our dad and he stayed with the grandparents. 

 while Josh was going through his therapy he moved in with me in my room. It was traumatic for me seeing my brother and best friends health declining so badly. He was fit, didn't smoke and was a complete health nut before. 

To cut a long story short my relatives (not my dad) made out to me he was getting better and things were going to be okay. After his first tumour was removed a second tumour emerged my relatives told me it was just scar tissue (THEY KNEW IT WASNT) it turns out, they knew it was terminal cancer from DAY 1!

 Because I thought he was getting better, i bailed on him a few times, cancelled plans with him, we argued and fought real bad sometimes and I said some nasty things to him. He always had social problems, he got teased at school, struggled to get a girlfriend and had depression. I on the other hand had NONE of these problems at all. I got pissed off having to share my room with him eventually and he ended up going from my house, mum's house and Nan's house. He didn't even have a home. 

They told me he was going to die 2 months before it happened.

If only they would have told me he was going to die earlier, these things never would have happened and the last part of his life would have been so much better. I'm now full of hate, and bitterness. I don't know how to deal with it. Even after 3 years I feel like crying ALL THE TIME. I have been diagnosed with  borderline personality disorder with schizotypal traits. My moods are all over the place. I am riddled with guilt. I hate my family now. All of them.

 I can't sleep without smoking weed, my performance at work is declining. I have 0 friends anymore apart from a top quality girlfriend. Most of the time i feel empty like a black void, I get pissed off and full of rage in a split second, I constantly lash out at people. I fantasize about suicide. (Not actually suicidal though) 
I'm never truley happy, I just put on an act for the sake of my dad and GF. My arms have scars on, my doors have holes in from being punched, my eyes are black, and i just hate everything and everyone. And I don't know what the fuck to do. 

I just feel so betrayed, I know they meant well by not telling me, but it has backfired real bad. I'm about to turn 24 in 3 weeks, and I have to live the rest of my life with this guilt.",09Jan2020,1
187,"Hi all. What are some tips for moving forward in a healthy way when someone has negatively judged you for your mental health. This situation was at work, but it was not warranted for the person to get in any trouble if i did come forward, but the words were very hurtful. Any tips are appreciated. I’ve let it built up and steal my inner peace. I’ve mediated, done yoga, and have prayed. The individual did say they didn’t mean to say it the way did and are sorry if it did hurt me. But I am still finding myself mad at this person and I can’t be since I have to work with them everyday. What they said was really not that big of deal and i don’t want to be petty, but my mind cannot then these negative thoughts off from this situation. Thanks in advance.",09Jan2020,1
188,"i feel completely purposeless in life and constantly think i don’t matter and that people don’t care about me, even though they tell me they do. i think i’m a burden and i don’t feel like i’m meant to exist in this life.",09Jan2020,1
189,"First I'm going to start with what I can see in my imagination.

So I do not see anything when thinking of something. For example if try to imagine the number ""1"" it isn't there I can't see it. If you ask me to draw a cat I won't be able to see a cat in my imagination. I know what a cat looks like I could even describe it to you but it's matter of fact information not visual.

I feel like my memories and imagination are different because on the other hand if you ask me to remember a certain time. Memories come to me like a full 4K video without a pause button to even see a still image. So in order for me to have a visual memory I have to like play the from the beginning to get to the part i'm trying to remember.

Now lets go back to the cat if you ask me to remember a cat I start thinking okay where have I seen a cat then I start, hitting what I call a back-log, with memories of people who I know have a cat and these memories would have to be significance memories to see the cat.

Here is my example of how I would get that from how it starts to end. I am looking for a moment where I saw a cat and I have hit a match. It's a memory of my brothers friends house when I was in 6 grade we had just walked 3 miles to get to his house walking on the side of the highway. I had never been there before. When I walked in I looked over to kitchen and looked in the living room we all sat down in the living room on the couch (some memories I can also hear sounds but not this one) we started talking and his white cat came into the room and jumped into my lap then I start petting it. I started having allergies problems sneezing, eyes burning, and headache (I can feel all of that as if it was happening right now) then we walked home while having issues the entire time and finally getting home where I took an allergy pill and put ice pack on my burning eyes. (that is where the memory ends)

Just to see that one cat I have to go through all of that and it may just be a small moment inside of full memory and if I miss any part of describing the cat I have to restart the memory from the beginning just to see the cat again. Which is why I say my memory is a video. I haven't hear about what other peoples memories are like so I'm not sure if all that is normal or not but that's just how my brain works.

I also had a hard time with math growing up because the only way I remember something is if it's matter of fact. So I was put in special education because of this reason also I had/have selective mutism but at the time they just thought I was mute and couldn't speak at all or just chose not to speak.

Anyway, the only reason I leaned how to add and subtract in elementary school is because a teacher showed me a way of adding that could be done with just writing down the number down so for example 4+3 4 comes to four points and 3 comes to three points so basically (1+1+1+1) + (1+1+1) (btw that was a full memory from first grade.) Now my matter of fact of math and how I remember is just because of repetitively doing it. It took me a long time to remember how to do multiplication it took a lot of repetitive thinking over and over until I got it. For the longest time I just remembered the easy ones like ones, twos, fives, tens. then I was taught a easy way of doing nines, the rest I'm still not sure of to this day I still have to work them out.

I was ok in science and history because for me I didn't have to try to imagine much. English was a bit more difficult mainly because it's hard for me to write in my head because I won't remember what I said by the end. So like what you are reading right now is a word that comes to my mind and gets written down. So every sentence is basically written word by word and not sentence by sentence. Which is why most of the time I have a lot words in sentences that don't need to be there, not enough, or don't notice my misspelling because i'm writing one word i'm think of the next.

Not sure if it counts but i'll add it anyway. Normally the only time I remember a dream is when I'm lucid dreaming which happens a lot and is the only time that I feel like I can actually imagine something I've never seen before. Also wanted to put in something about my ""inter-voice"" it seems like I can never stop talking to myself even when i'm trying to shut my inter-self voice up from overly thinking about something. While I think that I've quit doing it I then realize that I'm literally just saying shut up shut up over and over again and it doesn't end even if I start thinking about something else or while singing in my head with music playing. I will continually be thinking shut up like a broken record on top of what i'm currently thinking. (For me I see it as a overlay on top of my thoughts it's really annoying and usually is what triggers my anxiety.)

It's like my brain never takes a break unless i'm sleeping and some times even then its still going. (For context it is my own voice and it's not like i'm hearing other voices.)

I think I've hit every point of it but not sure. If i'm just dumb I already know please just leave a dislike and don't comment I have a lot of social anxiety issues and it was hard to write this for people to read in the first place. I'm refusing to reread what I wrote because if I do I probably will end up deleting it. It's not something I've have ever talked about to anyone before.

192,"I've struggled with my mental health for most of my life. Having alcoholic parents mentally abusing you throughout your life does that, I guess. But I got by. I've struggled with overthinking, anxiety and low self-esteem. I first visited therapist 3 years back, after I've found out my two closest friends have been talking about me behind my back (they said I was complaining all the time and that I've ruined our vacation because of it), which led to me isolating myself from everyone, and creating a new happy place in my mind - my own funeral. I couldn't stop thinking about it, and it made me feel calm.   


Eventually, I realised I can either call it quits or get help. I chose the latter, and was seeing a therapist for a few months, but then my school started again, and I didn't have enough money to keep going to her. But she helped me with my most urgent problems, and I've felt quite content ever since. (The only thing that stuck with me is that I've kept my complaints to a minimum, and every time I do complain about something, I get anxious my friends will find me annoying again).  


For a past year or so, I had trouble focusing and feeling motivated. My favorite thing to do was laying in my bed and watching some shitty youtuber talking about nothing (and that's not a good hobby if you're working on getting a degree as I do). I thought about having depression, but I didn't feel sad, I actually felt quite happy. Around this time, I met this guy and fell for him. It took me about 6 months to actually speak to him, but we started to see each other and man, did it feel good to have someone like that. He was as reserved as I was, smart, funny and probably the nicest guy I've ever met. And because of it, I felt really safe with him. That changed, when his ex (they were together for 7 years) learnt about us, and texted him saying how much she misses him, that she has severe depression and wants to get together again. And he agreed. I'm not mad at him for doing so, because I know he didn't want to hurt me, and that it must have been hard to make this decision, even though I would prefer him choosing me. His best friend told me he got together with her out of pity, but I don't really think it matters.   


The day he told me, I was crying for a bit, but I was fine. Even laughed about it with my friends. Probably because I was sure he would eventually realise he made a mistake and come back to me. The next day, I realised I couldn't take him back even if he wanted to, because I would be asking for him to hurt me again. This realisation hurt me as hell, and I couldn't stop crying. Today, I feel empty. I don't know how else to describe it. I just want to lay in my bed and stare at the wall. And I don't even think about him that much today. I know something is wrong, but I'm not sure if it's just me dealing with a heartbreak or if the heartbreak only started something. I've wanted to reach out to a therapist again, but I also feel kind of bad because of it, and don't want to go there. I don't know why. I don't know what to do, but I feel lost and scared, because I have exams this month and I don't know how I can make myself study even though I really need to.  


Any recommendations on how to feel better again and how to get through the exams would be much appreciated.  


Also, I'm sorry for any mispells, I don't speak English that well.",09Jan2020,1
193,"
""Call my dad!,"" ""Please call my dad!,"" ""I cannot, not right now, we need to get you to the hospital."" I remember the day, it was sunny, working with one of my best friends. Stand by fire! Excited, usually one of those calls that we get to stand there and hope no one gets hurt. 

As we were en route, we started to receive updates via our truck computer… house on fire, neighbors state its an abandoned house, I remember telling my partner ""oh, another one."" Next update, neighbors report there's a man on fire walking down the street. Our jaws drop, we hoped it wasn't right, or some feeble attempt to get the fire department there faster. 

I remember turning the corner and seeing him. He stood on the corner silent, not waving his hands, not yelling, not doing anything but standing there. Still smoldering, naked, all of his hair was gone, anything to make him recognizable gone — just a human figure standing there. His eyes matched the neighbors who witnessed the event, wider then I have ever seen. ""Am I going to die?""… ""not now""….. ""call my dad""…. ""not now""... What else could I say to him? The 23-year-old has suffered more burns than I have seen on some dead people, and yet he was talking to me. 

“What happened?”

""They said if I told anyone they would do this to each of my family members..."" Silence. ""Tell us something before you pass out."" 

En route to the hospital, we did everything we could do for him. We gave him medications, started IVs, called the hospital, and let them know we were coming and get everyone to the trauma bay. We arrived at the hospital and started our update... 23 y/o male … ""He's dead"" The doctor said. I couldn't even get through my report, and the doctor took a 4 ft away assessment and told us he was dead. ""He's still talking sir"" I remember uttering back. ""It doesn't matter; he is dead or is going to be."" He then went on to explain that he had full-thickness burns 100% of his body, and there was nothing they could do but delay death. Three nurses then left the room, crying. 

I remember walking out of the room with tears building in my own eyes. I stood outside the room for a moment to gather myself and remember overhearing the social worker talking on the phone, ""get here now sir, I know you're busy, but this is urgent."" She laid down the phone, knowing she couldn't tell him what had happened, just that he needed to be there, now with his dying son. 

This is just one of the hundreds of people that live now in my memories. They may not show up every day, but they do show up. I find that certain events trigger these people back into the images in my mind, regressed is some dark place. Things like a house fire or ""Call my dad"" bring them back. I re-live it like I was there, what could I have done differently? Maybe if I... has replayed hundreds of times in my head. In school, I was told not to burden any of the blame when people die because of their own poor decisions; however, what was never taught is it is impossible to be a compassionate human being and not burden any fault when a person dies.

As Paramedics, EMTs, Dispatchers, Firefighters, and Police Officers, we are faced with more trauma in one week than most people will see in their lifetime. 

What's the worse thing you have seen? That's a famous line at every family gathering. Well, welcome back to all the people living in that repressed dark lace in my head. Some of them are the unspoken ones, the ones you don't want to talk about. The kid being sexually and mentally assaulted by the live-in boyfriend. The elderly man that died months ago, but the family needed to live off his checks, the young mother who just lost her life in an MVA surrounded by her family, while the children escaped relatively unharmed. Yet still, only the tip of the iceberg. 

The phone rang, ""are you ready for in-service?"". No, I want to go and hug my family and tell them that I love them, I want to be anywhere but here right now focused on the kid who was dying in the other room, waiting for his father to come to the hospital. Most of all, I want just a minute to think about what just happened, decompress, gather myself, and talk about what I just saw. ""In-service,"" "" ok, you got one"" onto the next call. 

It's part of the job. That's old school thinking, and it's time for a change. Years ago, we used not to wear gloves either, and doctors used to smoke while assessing patients, we have since found out that wasn’t the best idea, and learned from that. Now it's time to change the way that we also treat mental health with first responders. Mental health is just as if not more important than physical health. 

Cleveland EMS is broken, Cleveland Public Safety is broken. It used to be a respected profession. Now we are spit on... When we try and go to administration with concerns, we are spit on by them. It's almost impossible to go home healthy after that. I couldn't do it. I wasn't strong enough, and bless those who are. The City of Cleveland broke me, and I had to leave to try and fix me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have had these tendencies for a while, but only in these past 2 years have I come to realise how bad I think they're affecting my psyche. I have always been pretty level headed and forward thinking, but that hasn't stopped me from feeling blue or pretty down for periods of time. I was at my absolute lowest about 4 years ago when I was in a pretty shit relationship. I feel that my reading habits might relate back to how my ex was, and perhaps me trying to make sense/protect myself from being in a horrible situation again. I feel like the more I know about the worst face of misogyny, the better I'll be  prepared in dealing with it/avoiding it should I see it in person. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reality is I am and have moved on tremendously since I started reading negative things. I feel that it's only now that I'm in a better place (generally happier, in a healthy relationship, creatively satisfied in work, a new hobby or two etc) that I can see how bad these things are.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what I'm asking really. I feel I can't 'just quit', but I know they're not helping me. I need another outlet but I don't know what this outlet is exactly helping me with.

i work at a grocery store, kroger. i work in the online shopping department, so people place orders online and then i shop what they wanted and then take it to their cars when they arrive. when i first started everything was great. i liked my manager and the other people i worked with. over winter break, i took a vacation with my fiancées family down to florida (i live in indiana) and i really enjoyed getting out of the house and spending time with them. they’re all really cool and amazing people. after i came back home, work turned into a nightmare. there was a bunch of drama because someone in the department wasn’t doing their job and everyone was being petty about it. since i was gone for a week and had only been doing my job for about 2 weeks, it took me a while to get back into the swing of things. hell, i’m still not back into it. everything i do has been scrutinized all week. i’m a really quiet person. i don’t really talk back unless i’m really pissed. that hasn’t happened yet, for better or worse. i’ve felt like i’ve had a target on my back this week. i can’t do anything right and it’s driving me insane. every time i show up i have a panic attack. i’ve been having one since about 5 and it hasn’t gone away. it’s really slow and i have nothing to do right now. i hate going to work. i live with my parents now and i plan on moving out with my fiancée when she graduates from school. i don’t get many hours even after telling my boss i want more so i’m really only making enough to make my car payments. i want to quit my job and do temporary work for a few months until i move out and find a more permanent full time job, but my parents don’t want me to do that. they are aware of my mental health issues and they try to help. that’s all they really can do. i’ve explained my current situation to them and they try to sympathize with me but they just tell me to not be sad. i’m not sure if if that’s what they’re really saying. i kind of space out and don’t really hear anything with i get chastised like that. i don’t want to let my family down. i want to be independent and help support my fiancée when she starts college so we don’t have to worry about money. am i crazy here? is it okay for me to feel like this? am i too sensitive? that’s what my mom said. that i wouldn’t do well in a factory because i don’t like messing up and being scolded for it. but i feel like that’s gonna happen anywhere i work. i’m tired of always feeling like i’m being too sensitive and overreacting to doing my job wrong. i can’t do this though. i can’t stop pacing. i can’t stop thinking about everything. my mind is moving at 100 miles an hour. i’m not even sure if typing this helped me. i don’t know what to do. i don’t want to feel like this anymore. i know it won’t happen instantly but i just want to start taking steps in the right direction. i’m tired of feeling like i use my problems as an excuse or a crutch for everything.",09Jan2020,1
