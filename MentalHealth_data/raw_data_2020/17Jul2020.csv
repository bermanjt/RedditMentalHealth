They meet people and want to spend time with them and build entirely new lives with that person. I desperately want to want those things but I just cant. Everytime i try to meet new people we text for a while until it comes time to meet them and then i feel so much dread, like meeting a new person is the last thing i want to do. Then I just get stuck in a cycle of being terrified of the future because at this rate I'll just end up living alone forever and doing nothing other than going to work and coming home because no matter what I do or who I'm with, i feel like I'd just rather be alone.

5,"Hi lovely Reddit folk.

My friend and her dog, based in the US, is currently living with her parents (lost job due to covid etc etc).

A few days ago, her dog and her mum had an altercation (nobody was physically hurt), resulting in her dad becoming extremely defensive and as a result, aggressive, threatening to kill her dog if he came near them again (not great of course when they all live together, but perhaps a heat of the moment reaction?) 

Now, she doesn't even know WHERE to begin processing this. Feels unsafe in her own home, in addition to a heap of other elements massively affecting her mental health.

She wants to reach out for some therapy to her her process and figure out how to begin moving on from this, but is worried that a therapist may hear about this altercation and report it as a potential threat/dangerous behaviour by her dad (who didn't touch anybody, just threatened with a kitchen utensil that wasn't a knife).

Does anybody know in the US if this is the sort of thing a therapist would have to report, or if its not at that level?

Would really appreciate any insight, thanks",17Jul2020,1
6,"For some reason, when I was about 7-8 I got a very strong feeling like part of my soul died. In a couple of months it developed to me having a strong feeling that my best friend had died, this best friend never existed, I was and still am grieving for a dead person that never existed. 

My best friend is a girl my age, well she died but she was my age. Her death caused me a lot of sadness which led to depression, I’m still now many years later depressed and hold strong feelings for her. I take anti-depressants prescribed by a psychiatrist but I still grieve for her. Despite the fact that she doesn’t exist, and never has.

When I was younger I was often bullied and had not a single friend, I think it’s possible that I may have made up a best friend. I’m not sure. But it affects me deeply and I really don’t know what to do. I even have memories, of her smile, her personality and stuff like that, although I cannot recall what she looked like other than basic features. I have no idea what her face other than her smile looks like.

When I learned about how my second daughter, who was the first to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder, was harming herself, I knew I must do everything to stay focused, to not give in to my depression.  When she was hospitalized, I prayed hard not to have a meltdown. Fighting my depression at that moment was painful, even physically.

I have a spending problem. Im a 28 y.o. RN. here in Ontario. I work in ER.

I have been reading about personal finance and started with Wealthy Barber returns.

I adopted some of his advice: automatic payments to my savings, writing down what I spend money on.

My issue is spending seems to be emotional to a certain degree for me. I spend most when I am off work. When I feel I am lacking something (let's say I need to be more organized, or I need more friends) I tend to buy products like books, self help books, coaching, etc...

I realize that on one level of assessment, I am needing validation that I'm not getting in life, and I use money to satiate those negative emotions/chaos...

 First step stop being around people that make you want to die. 

Second step was long form breathing meditation. There is no wrong way to breathe. I just make sure of one thing. I let my mind go wild with music in the background or university lectures free online while deep breathing. The only rule of meditation is to have fun. 

Third step is diet, nutrition, and exercise. Let me explain the significance of the big D. At bare minimum if you do not want to run miles without your shirt outside please I beg the lord, at least go out and  get some sun for 10 minutes a day or vitamin D through supplementation. Your body uses this vitamin for a chunk of the procceses in your body. Zinc and Magnesium are also mandatory for myself.

She mentioned a coworker named Joe that she was friends with, i immediately had a bad gut feeling about Joe. Anyway as time goes on she starts talking to me less and less and every conversation we have, Joe gets mentioned one way or another. She stops preforming... maintenance on me? Not sexual but just caring how I’m feeling or even asking how my day was when I go out of my way to stay up through every breakdown she has. It kinda comes to a head one night when I’m feeling shitty about my body and I ask her for some encouraging words, which she responds with “You’re handsome” and she sends me a video of Joe making a joke about something unrelated. I confront her for not taking care of me and she  gets incredibly defensive and blows up on me. Eventually we stop talking and kinda move into a friendship, she just treated me like a friend without even saying she wanted to stop talking. After a week of almost no communication she calls me asking me to meet with her after a horrible day at work. I meet up with her at what she deemed was “Our spot” and Joe rolls up. Thinks are smooth and she’s almost immediately touching him in some way of other, he was in between me and her almost the entire time, in what I believe was a “She’s mine” type of thing. Eventually they go to sit down and he mentions “Oh hey we stopped to cuddle here before right?” At which she doesn’t respond and my heart kinda sinks. That was our spot and she took him there? A few minutes after that I left and we haven’t talked until the other night. She calls me crying saying how she does so much to help Joe (her new boyfriend), reminding him to take meds, to eat, comforting him through issues, and he can’t even stay with her through an anxiety attack. I, immediately thinking of the irony stay on the phone with her trying to think of a way to get out of the friendship without hurting her now or in the future as I still care about her. I’ve considered just blocking her but it could cause more strife if she needed me and found out I just blocked her. I know I’m just a filler guy for her and she’ll move on when she finds anyone remotely better, but like I said I want to do this without hurting her, as smooth as possible. 

Tldr: Ex and me started talking again (like pre dating talking) and she valued me at first but lost all interest in me once she found another guy. She even took him to what was “our spot” to cuddle. She’ll only call me when she needs emotional support and doesnt talk to me (like normal conversation) in return.

27,"I have been dealing with some anxieties that have been constantly anguishing me and tbh I find it to be very happy nowadays.

I(20M) have been a perfectly healthy since young and in school, I was a cheerful guy and I usually felt happy. However, in the recent years, I joined a different organisation in which people are very dependent of each other and a lot of things have to be done through team effort. Hence, this has resulted in people always trying to be alpha and “one-up” others to make themselves feel better. Also, it is not common for people to blame others for their mistakes since they are affected as well.

How has this affected me?

Personally, I was not one of the best in this organisation and I could not do my things as good as others. Hence, I frequently came under the scrutiny of others and my peers would put me down sometimes when I make mistakes. Initially, that didn’t affect me much. However, after spending almost a year and a half in this environment, I have become very defensive towards myself and get very agitated when others scrutinise me for my mistakes even when sometimes they mean good.

At the same time, there were many people who are two-faced and people often talked bad about their peers behind their back. The effect that this had on me, coupled with the environment described above, made me very doubtful of others loyalty and intentions. I always find myself not being able to trust people and whether they are really there for me.

To be honest, I know that I should open up and trust more but overtime, I just find it so difficult to do so. The thought of isolating myself to attain inner peace has become so much more frequent recently. I wish these thoughts can stop plaguing me everyday.

If anyone can shed some light on how to improve my mindset, that would mean a lot.
Thanks!

31,"I’m a girl and I’m 19 yrs old

     What’s driving me insane everyday is the voices in my mind. The voices are real alive people and they sound faint. They are people I like from social media and real life. As soon as I wake up, I have back and forth conversations with the people I like and would love to talk to them at the moment. They sound nothing like them but maybe similar. I can talk in my head but I don’t hear my voice it’s hard to explain. They can talk to each other sometimes but it’s almost rare. It’s strange because, every time I go on social media, I listen to the person talking in the video and then when the video ends, I remember how they sound like and I began talking with them inside my head. I don’t talk to them out loud or want to because that would make me look crazy however, something embarrassing happens sometimes, Like when something funny I said or they said and I can’t help but smile a little but if it happened in real life I would be laughing. And classmates saw me burst laughing or smile when nothing funny happened. 
Sometimes I can’t hear the voices I like and it feels like they left. And I miss their voice. all the voices comfort me when I’m upset. But some are present and silent, I feel their presence. It’s like they have nothing to say. 


 Where it began
 
     I go to a girls only school. Since grade 9, from the middle of the first semester strange things are happening in my head. I learned about the inner dialogue from a fictional Korean series I was watching. I was in class and I started to think of the people around me could hear what I’m thinking about. I was 15 years old. It was math class, on the board there was numbers like: 1,3,5,7,9. and in my head I was saying 1,3.5,7,9 and the girl behind me was whispering to herself the numbers at the same time I was saying it. Since this happened, I was suspicious about if they can hear my inner dialogue. I’m still suspicious at the moment. but since no one is saying anything about it, that means that they can’t or I’m going to questioning my existence forever. One day , At bedtime as I was drifting off, I heard someone heavily breathing in front of my face, I can’t tell if it was me not realizing it or the bed cover. And one time as I was snuggling into bed and you could hear the sound of the bed cover at the same time I heard the girl’s voice saying how are you, but because of the bed cover I couldn’t be sure so, I went to sleep thinking it was nothing. So after the finals it’s summer break and things happened. One day I was bored. And I felt alone in my head, I was kind of jealous of people who hear voices. I wanted to draw on paper so I did that to get rid of my boredom. As I was drawing  it reminded me of the girl who was judging my drawing in grade 9 so I heard “She’s ugly” and “ She always draws girls” and we don’t have the best relationship. She’s not my friend and I don’t like her, she’s rude sometimes. Her voice is faint while she’s talking in my head. As I was in grade 10 and 11 I was always listening to other girls and learning how they sound like and at home when I feel alone like I have always been I have back and forth conversations with them, sometimes or arguing and sometimes it’s funny. 


The fantasy world I live in
  
   This fantasy world is hidden in my head and from the outside I look totally normal doing daily tasks like I’ve always been. Feeling alone in my head makes me want to talk to someone inside my head that I would wish to have conversations with. I went through hard times. One time it was midnight and I woke up to their voices (the girls I know from school) then I was trying to go sleep again but I couldn’t because at that time I was thinking that they all hate me and I was crying while I heard they’re comments. I went to the living room since I can’t sleep, I was just sitting on the couch staring at the wall listening to what they say, repeating words over and over. In my head I was saying I’m so sorry to them if I did hurt them without knowing and crying. as I was doing that I could see couples kissing on the wall everywhere I look on the wall. It was weird. but then I went to bed and woke up feeling fine in the morning. 
In grade 10 during the spring break, I was thinking why in the world I hear voices in my head then I thought I was cursed and that I’m dying after a few days and that I’m no longer under my god’s mercy and god cursed me because I don’t worship god. I’m going to quickly say what I saw and what I experienced during the daydream so, at that time it was the first time I heard a voice that it’s unrecognized and not familiar, it’s girls voice, two of them, one of them cried rarely and the other told me to pray/read. I was praying and in the carpet I was praying on I saw the devils face smiling at me and I was terrified I also heard his voice screaming outside my house whenever I pray. Another daydream where I hallucinate on my phone in my social media, I saw a strange tweet (on Twitter). Anyways about the voices I hear I also feel their presence around me when I want to cuddle them, I feel a little warmth. This year, in the middle of January, I talked about the voices to my sister and she said that what I’m having is normal it’s because you remember the people you know and you feel like you hear their voice. That made me no longer hallucinate for some reason. Maybe it’s because it made the voices not real. I have always known that the voices are not real the whole time though. The voices I hear right now are the people I know. 


What I think about the voices in my head. 

   As I said, they can be comforting me when I’m upset. and sometimes funny and it fills the loneliness. But I break down because of them, they can be annoying and won’t shut up. So, I did want to end my life during these times but seeking help is the only answer. I get tired of listening to their voice. But it feels like I can’t get enough of their voice and as long as I’m thinking about something with my inner dialogue, they will reply to me but sometimes they just repeat the words I say and that’s it. I honestly don’t know what to do. I don’t even know what mental illness is this? I’ve heard about tulpa. It’s like having unlimited tulpas. I don’t know. But I’m sure I need help.",17Jul2020,1

Tl;Dr I have an exam coming up but am too depressed to study, here's an unconventional way i found to deal (you can skip to the second paragraph to skip further context)

I have an important exam coming up that will determine basically the rest of my life, this has obviously caused many mental challenges in addition to my already existing ones, I've got a chronic but mild depression (non-clinical) that can get pretty bad if unchecked, since coronavirus started i have a way harder time keeping myself in check, and since this exam is getting quite close I'm getting increasingly anxious, only one problem here, i'm not done studying and if i took the exam today i would fail tremendously, but whenever i start studying i feel like i'm having a panic attack, i can't concentrate and i even get a rush of suicidal thoughts, and a general overwhelming feeling of lack of motivation that leads me to have to lay in bed until these feelings go away (if they do), one way i initially found to help was playing videogames or watching youtube videos until i felt ready to study, but this would result in sub-optimal productivity, and i genuinely felt if i continued this way i wound't be able to make it

Recently for whatever reason i decided to wake up at 5am (i had been waking around 8), and to my surprise, when i got up i felt pretty fine with studying, i did it fine until the sun came up around 7, so that was pretty solid, but then i felt sleepy again and slept till 8, i discovered polyphasic sleep on accident, i started doing some research, especially on r/polyphasic, and immediately started my new unconventional sleep schedule, 11pm to 2am, study from 2am to 6am, sleep till 8-9am, and i have to say, i've been more productive in those 4 hours of the day than all the other 14 hours im awake

I'm not saying this will work for everyone in every problem but it did for me, i'm still a ways to go though, i used to go to boxing gym before corona, it's been 5 months of quarantine where i live and i haven't done a bit of exercise+worse eating diet, so i've gained a bit of weight and lost all the muscle mass i built in the time i was boxing, so that sucks

I also decided to give up porn (specifically doujin and hentai), i thought since they are animated it isnt as bad as porn, and maybe its not, but having that in front of me 24/7 was starting to affect my sexual relationships as well as consume alot of time from my day",17Jul2020,1
40,"My friend was just a normal college student. He was in a fraternity. He was a fun normal guy. Maybe did too many drugs including psychedelics. After about half way through sophomore year he dropped out. Once he dropped out he started acting odd. Recently he got really into reading Hebrew and he shaved his head. He posts on Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram multiple times a day. And his posts barely make sense. He tries to use math to explain Hebrew and English. I don’t think anyone understands what he is trying to say. He also posts pictures of himself doing really weird stuff at the gym. 

Could he be in the early phases of schizophrenia? His behavior has completely changed over the past two years. Everyone that knows him is either concerned or just making fun of him. And if he is showing signs of schizophrenia how should we approach him about it, because I’m sure he thinks he is fine and has just awoken. 

Any advice or or links to what to do would be greatly appreciated",17Jul2020,1

47,"i'm going to start this off by saying i don't think this is going to be well written. but more a flow of my thoughts at the moment. &amp; that bothers me because i majored in journalism &amp; minored in writing.

but for the past few years, i've suspected that i may be bipolar / manic depressive. i'm a person who loves staying active, i work out \~5x a week &amp; like staying busy &amp; feel good when i'm productive. but then i'll fall into periods where i'll barely move. i have no motivation for my job, no motivation to talk to people &amp; no motivation to get up &amp; get out &amp; work out. i come to conclusions that nothing matters. during these periods i do the bare minimum at my job (like truly, minimum) &amp; i overeat A LOT. which in turn makes me feel worse. but yet, i keep doing it. i'll also become super hyperactive at points. over-talking, making lots of jokes, coming to a ""who the fuck"" cares attitude &amp; acting ""insanely silly."" also when these kinds of episodes are going on, i thought, which i've thought for years, that i have sleep paralysis, but now i'm thinking i may be having hallucinations. this ""sleep paralysis"" occurs at the same time when these episodes are going on. when i'm falling asleep, i have mostly auditory hallucinations of things being said or noises that aren't actually happening. sometimes it's just clicks, but other times it's been some pretty scary shit. a few weeks ago i thought i heard someone in my hallway screaming ""he's killing me."" it wasn't happening. im always aware these are hallucinations when i come to out of my almost asleep state. 

when i was younger i had more suicidal thoughts &amp; did engage in self-harm, but i don't do that now &amp; don't really have any suicidal thoughts.

my grandma was bipolar &amp; my sister is bipolar (type 2 i think?) &amp; schizophrenic.

i'm the kind of person who deals w/ shit on my own. i'm the peacemaker in my family &amp; friend group and pride myself on being someone people i love can count on, so i don't air my own shit often. but i'm embarrassed and confused &amp; feel like i'm overreacting when i think about getting help &amp; feel like i wouldn't be able to accurately describe what's going on to someone professionally without actually being in this state because i downplay it all. or maybe i'm not. maybe i'm ""up-playing"" it.

i don't really know how to go forward. i guess i'm wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences or if this is normal or if anyone else really struggled with the thought of getting help &amp; if they really need it &amp; actually being able to talk if/when they did choose to talk to someone.",17Jul2020,1

50,"Last week I [25M] was formally diagnosed with ADHD. I also met markers for severe depression, some OCD-like tendencies (constantly cleaning the house, proper placement of items, etc.), and generalized anxiety disorder. This came after months of ups and downs, mood swings and breakdowns. Ca. 2018 I even contemplated killing myself a couple of times. My upbringing was something of a trip and it took years of therapy, journaling, and rebuilding myself to escape the damage that it caused. All that being said, I couldn't be happier.

I noticed that he was feeling down for quite a while now, and I try my best to help him but I'm not a health professional so I can't do much. So, I asked him if he wanted to call a social worker ( we have a 24/7 line that we can call in case we need to talk ). They really helped me and all social worker that I talked to there, they were all very nice and I liked them a lot, even if we only talked once.

He told me that he's mental health isn't important and he's just going to deal with it. I tried to convince him that he matters and he's health too but he doesn't believe me.

I struggle in general with anxiety, and especially with everything going on in the world today, of course it’s going to be heightened. I can’t afford to go to a doctors to talk to someone, and therapy is not an option with insurance (which I don’t have). Any suggestions from anyone who also struggles?

(Laser hair removal) I am a female and I suffer from a condition that causes me to have excessive dark hair over places like my stomach that normally a female wouldn't have. I also have the amazing talent of growing a beard and mustache. 
I'm aware I can shave but that also makes it worse because I get irritation and pimples and such. I did research and I really feel like this is an amazing thing. We discussed it but I think he gave me mixed signals and now that I have sign up for it he is furious. Now I'm beating myself up for finally taking a leap that will make me feel better about myself and stop reminding me that i have this condition. 

This condition already makes me suffer for so many other things in my life. I dont want to have to shave places that normal women dont have to. I want to be able to wear my work shirt and not have a chin hair get caught in it and ripped out of my face. (It fucking hurts). I want to not feel disgusted with myself.

61,"This happened today and I’m still really really shook up. I don’t even know if I’m posting this in the right place. I just don’t know what to do. 

I went to visit my therapist, which I’m usually excited for. I like talking to him about my feelings because he gives me good advice and I had a lot of things I wanted to talk about. 

So I started talking about how I’ve been feeling physically. I said I’ve been depressed because I’ve been fatigued and I don’t feel like I’m getting some stuff done. I mention when I started feeling fatigued is when I started my period, which was HEAVY and lasted 10 days and was heavy the whole time. I’m also an overweight person working a job where I run around a lot. Add the mask and the heat and It’s exhausting. 

He asked me about being short of breath. I’m no more short of breath than any other fat person running around. He says I need to get tested for covid ASAP. He ends the session a half hour early and even calls the place and tells them I’m going to be there. I’m in tears as he rushes me out the door. 

I get in the car and drive to the place. I call them to make sure there isn’t any other procedures I need to take and I can just walk in there. 
They said in order to have a free test I need to see my doctor first, which to my therapist wasn’t the option. So, I might be paying out of pocket for this. 

Anyway, I go in and meet with the provider in there. 

I explain what’s been going on and she even says I’m probably just anemic after having such a strong period. My temp was 98.4. She did a nose swab and said I’m probably fine since my nose wasn’t clogged or anything. She really had to dig around. 

I leave and call all the people I’ve been in contact with. Everyone is pretty upset that my therapist would take this to this level but they were grateful I called. My dad is absolutely livid. No one is mad at me yet which is what I was kinda scared of. 

My anxiety is through the roof and I feel terrible for not taking covid into consideration when thinking about how I’ve been feeling. I’m depressed and feeling extreme guilt. I haven’t stopped shaking since he said to leave. I’m not worried about me having but the thought of giving it to people I was with kills me. 
But I only had one symptom that was pretty understandable considering my circumstances. Everyone I talked to said if they were just fatigued, they wouldn’t have thought it either. 

I’m really lost. Should I be upset with him for taking my explainable fatigue and making me get tested or should I be understanding and forgive him and keep seeing him once this is over?

Today the same friend took me to a clinic and I ended up getting crutches, but for some reason I feel guilty. Not only do I feel like I wasted her time, but I also feel like I should’ve just suck it up and taken the pain and not be too dramatic. I also noticed that most of the friends I thought would ask if I was okay didn’t and/or have not checked up on me. I feel that thinking like that is selfish, but it also makes me a bit sad noticing that. On another note, there’s an event I’ve been anticipating since March happening next week but due to COVID it was changed online. Because of this, my role is not as important anymore but it also seems like most people aren’t as motivated as I was for the event and it makes me really unmotivated and hard to communicate and help them out. Now with all of that, I feel very bad reaching out to friends for help knowing they are all stressing out right now as well bc of said event and even when I do reach out to people I feel more guilty and worse than when I just kept it to myself. I’m not really sure why I feel this way, but it bothers me that I can’t genuinely see someone wanting to help me and listen to me out. I guess I don’t want them seeing me differently, but I also don’t see how to reach out to them because in the end I always just end up making jokes or convincing myself it’s not that important and I should just move on and stayed quiet to begin with. I’m not really sure how to stop this mindset from happening, I do understand asking and giving help goes both ways but I don’t want my friends to see me as selfish, dumb, or over dramatic for some of the things that go on in my head. And even though I know they won’t think that way, I can’t stop my head from thinking that they do which I think it’s unfair for me to do.

67,"Hi, I'm Ellie, I've never been officially diagnosed with depression or anxiety or anything. I dont have the best relationship with my family. I'm an lesbian 20yo woman, and I often feel like they dont care about my feelings, what I have to say, they belittle and mock me, they are passively homophobic/racist/sexist and when I try to correct them or discuss it with them they never listen or care to change. Even some of my closest relatives who I love and care about do this from time to time, and sometimes that can hurt more.

I've been emotionally stunted for years. I feel like I dont have healthy responses to things. If a woman in her 40s or 50s says something to me in a mildly challenging or authoritative voice I involuntarily feel the need to cry. Its overwhelming. And usually when a family member close to me does something that hurts me or leads to an arguement, I get usually get that feeling. So I leave the area, start crying heavily, and start to get really terrible thoughts.

I've frequently considered suicide as a way to express the pain they've caused me. It's the only way I can imagine they'd feel regret or remorse for their actions. I've never verbalized this to them, as its textbook emotional manipulation to threaten suicide, but I can't help thinking it when I'm upset. Trigger warning, but it's gotten to points where I've theorized how to kill myself in moments of duress, such as slitting my wrists, walking into traffic, or swimming out into the center of a lake until I'm too tired to swim anymore.

I've never gone through with any of these thoughts, and I dont cut myself or hurt myself. I just feel like they'll never understand without some severe consequence that they cant undo how these things hurt me or grind me down over time. I dont know if this is normal or if I should seek help or medication. And to be honest I kind of just needed a place to vent my emotions after a very similar incident happened today with my Aunt.

87,"*Just writing down whatever comes to my mind. Will probably post the same in a couple other subreddits*

So, M(21)y girlfriend (long distance relationship) has depression (from a past relationship plus family issues) and her parents are not really the kind who 'believe' anything like that happens. Moreover, they are separated (not divorced) and always put her in between and give no fucks about anything happening to her (I would refer to my girlfriend as 'her'/'she' throughout). She doesn't like either of her parents since they have really been treating her like shit; her dad lives and works in my home town (I study elsewhere) while her mom lives in a different place a bit closer to where she goes to college. She had gone to stay at her father's for a week when suddenly the entire country was put under lockdown and she had to stay 3 months on the trot with a very toxic father who always feels like she should be constantly grateful for everything he's done for her and that he didn't throw her to the streets. During her period cramps, he didn't believe that it pains and forced her to so some household chores which led to her fainting, which he also called fake. Plus he kept shouting at the top of his voice all the time which led to partial hearing loss for her and she slept around 3-4 hours per day the entire period of time. We pleaded her mom to file a complaint or do something about it but she was unbothered by it all.

We somehow got her out of the place to a flat which she shares with two other near her college in another city, lying to her dad about why she's going away. In this new place too she's suffering a lot because one of the flatmates eats up her food and does not take any precautionary measures while going to her workplace, doesn't clean up after coming back and sleeps with other guys at their houses not caring about the pandemic. The other flatmate doesn't even stay there right now. Also the flat has 5-6 hours of electricity shut off each day due to some maintenance going on. You can understand what her situation is

Also her dad doesn't pay her any money really. She's searching for a part time job or internship very eagerly but hasn't been able to get one so far. This and a whole lot of other problems too.

You might ask how this is relevant? Because this is where I come in. I've been kinda the only person who's been with her throughout everything. She doesn't really have any friends providing actual support, just saying ""It must be tough for you. But hold on"". I've been the guy she tells everything to. I've been the person staying awake leaving everything I have if my own to take care of her and her feelings. To uplift her and help her in any way and to pull her ahead on the darkest days when she went towards the edge of giving up her life. Till today every second awake I've tried to remain if she needs someone to talk to or needs any help. Why I do it is because firstly I adore her and secondly I'm scared because she actually has no one except me.

And all this has affected me a lot too I admit. Now a bit about me. I have never been diagnosed professionally but I show symptoms of ADHD. I suffer very severely from procrastination and I have tried getting help for that. I get really anxious moments whenever a deadline comes near because I always put off eveything till the last possible minute. This happens very frequently and I really feel low and defeated in those moments.

And that is what is happening now. I have to finish a compulsory project in ny department that I was given months to work on and I only have about 13 days left for it. This project is supposed to be under the guidance of a professor but my prof has been really unhelpful and has just stated the topic on which to work on. This is a topic which would need the help of someone with more advanced knowledge but I'm afraid to ask my prof (or any other prof in my department for that matter) because he is quite moody.

I've been putting off so much for two reasons, because I've been really busy taking care of my partner and because I have this very irritating habit of procrastination on everything.

I would gladly acknowledge any help/advice coming my way (regarding her problems as well as mine).  And if you've actually read this entire thing with patience you're really awesome",17Jul2020,1

99,"Okay so this might be a long post but I'll try and make it not so word-y. I sort of had an epiphany this morning but I'm not sure what it means or what to do about it. Just wanting to see if anyone has any similar experiences.


For the record- I am 23 and have been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, among other things, by a medical professional. 


Basically the conclusion I have come to is that I was raised in an abusive and toxic household that showed no signs of love or how to treat someone properly, (parents always fought physically &amp; verbally, neither of them ever had any friends or did anything but be narcissistic or have a drinking problem &amp; neglectful).  I had one friend from birth, until I was 15 and then they left me without an explanation or ever talking to me again.  I havent had a best friend since then, and no friendships that I have had have ever lasted over like a year or a year and a half. On the off chance that they did, they've been up and down, and just overall toxic.

 I did have a friend group for 4 years in college, but they all dropped me and blocked me over one argument that was a misunderstanding. Probably a solidification of all of the years of the toxic up and downs. I feel like I can't connect with people, if I do it's very rare, but I feel like an alien and theres an invisible wall between me and everyone else. I think I know them really well and that they know me, I consider that a really great friendship, but in reality it's all just surface level. I don't have anyone I could immediately go to with problems or really share a connection with. The people I do think I have this with are always people I like romantically. Since all of my friends I've ever had have left me, I can't make connections with people without them ending in a complete massacre, and us never speaking again. I now have a major fear of abandonment &amp; rejection from these relationships and other things. (hello BPD).

 So since I have all of that in my ever growing bag of baggage,  (it's like Hermione's beaded bag, it never ends) I've noticed that I put every single strain on my romantic relationships. I get super obsessed and I think I'm connecting really well with someone when I'm talking to a potential romantic partner, or even when we actually date, if we date.  I think this is because I dont have any other healthy relationships &amp; I desperately want to find that one person again who will stay with me and love me and we can work through stuff together because that's what good healthy real love is supposed to be right?? Except I'm not entirely sure if I even know what that is, because I never got to see it as a child, and any of my relationships that I've had as an adult have been explosive and just generally a rollercoaster and short-lived.

 I put every expectation on my romantic relationships because maybe it's the one good thing I might actually be able to have, and be good at, since nothing else ever seems to work out for me, and I want to find a best friend and partner in one person, but I also want other friends. I just can't seem to make them or keep them, but that's definitely not fair to my partner because that in itself is unhealthy. I feel like I'm trying to stuff all of my blocks into my relationship bag when they don't belong to, or fit in there, because I dont have any other bags to put them in. The relationship bag also has holes. Lol. If that makes sense. 

I told this to the last therapist I had, and I feel as if it's a decent metaphor. I feel like a sponge sometimes. Some people, you can run their sponge under water (water is love, attention, validation, etc.) And, like sponges usually do, they'll eventually get full and you have to squeeze them out so they can accept more water. However, my sponge never gets full when you run it under water. 

My emotions are so high and rocky with the BPD and I feel as if other people think I'm crazy since I tend to base my happiness on other people. I'm working on that through self love, but it's how my brain works and it's something that takes years and years to change. I'm just hoping that I'm not the only one who struggles with issues like this as an adult. Most people my age have healthy boundaries (I dont even know what boundaries are, really.) and relationships. It's tough realizing that it's hard for me to have those. 

If anyone has gone through similar problems, if you'd be willing to share some advice or personal experiences, anything would be appreciated.",17Jul2020,1

I feel like an entitled bitch for constantly crying about my feelings because I’ve been holding them in for 9 years. I feel that because there are so many problems in the world I don’t get to be sad just because I was traumatized as a child. My dad is cool now, he fixed himself and saved our family and I forgave him because it wasn’t completely his fault. I never forgot, though. I still cry about it. I still cry whenever someone tells me they’re proud of me because I never had that. I’ve always felt like my feelings didn’t matter because other people were suffering so much more than me.

114,"I have been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) a few years ago.  I only got diagnosed this because I was arrested and the lawyer that I wasted money on thought that by seeing a therapist it would help my case, which it did not.  So I wasted money on a therapist and on a lawyer, and still went to jail.  I already knew I was crazy, I didn't want to pay for confirmation.  Anyway, I am  wondering if there is another type of personality disorder that I have?  Here are things about me.

&amp;#x200B;

* I grew up with very few friends.  No birthday parties, sleepovers, etc.  I dated several girls but it never lasted long.
* I was not good at sports and never felt like part of the team when I played, so I always wanted us to lose.  It made me feel good to see my teammates upset as a kid when we lost, since I sat on the bench.
* I like seeing people hurt and killed.  I love a news story about a mass shooter, terrorist, or other violent criminal.  In my mind I'm thinking, good job!
* I lost my virginity to a prostitute at age 19.  Been with hundreds of girls, both prostitutes and girls I just hooked up with since then.  One long term (3 year) relationship which I cheated many times.  Happily single now.
* I did good in school in the STEM subjects, better than everyone else actually, got awards and scholarships, but people didn't like me.
* I think hackers are awesome!
* I hate my country.  I would rather join a hacking or terrorist group and blow up the country rather than support it.
* I used to have many suicidal thoughts growing up.  Those have subsided, but I still do picture my death but now I want a cool death, like being a suicial bomber.
* My favorite movies are horror, thriller, crime, espionage, good dramas that involve sex and violence.
* I am not close with my family.  I don't know if I love them or hate them but would not care if they all died.  I live in a different country from them now and have no plans to ever go home.
* I like to abuse alcohol and sleep with random women.  However, I go to the gym often so I am in great shape.  If I had the chance to do some hard drugs, I would, but I don't have any connections.  I will smoke tobacco and occassional weed if given the chance.
* I am mostly a loner, keep to myself.  
* I have mood swings.  Sometimes I feel like I'm on top of the world, other times I want to be a bumb and drink myself to death and slit my own wrists.
* I like to commit crimes that I can get away with.  My record is pretty good, only been jailed and convicted once, got away with hundreds of other crimes including one that could give me 20+ years in prison!
* I used to own several guns before I moved.  I thought about shooting myself in the head on Facebook live after getting 10000 viewers.

116,"My friend has been acting very strangely the last 2 weeks. All our friends are noticing it from her texts so another friend and I met her in person to see if she’s okay. She is NOT okay. She is extremely paranoid and delusional. Half of what she says makes no sense and the rest is ranting about the world. She keeps thinking that we’re being watched or listened. Something about apps communicating, Corona virus isn’t real, were in a simulation, etc. This is all very unusual for her to say. She forgets things very quickly. Like loses her train of thought very often and forgets where she’s going. She does random impulsive things. She thinks everything is connected somehow. Like seeing a bottle on the floor and googling it to find a deeper meaning. She even said she’s “not in touch with reality” and can’t sleep many nights. I’m no doctor but this is certainly more than stress and anxiety.

I was able to get her parents phone number and called her mom about it. But I don’t think her mom is grasping how bad it really is. Her English is also a bit rusty which doesn’t help. She did take her to the doctors but it seems nothing has come of it. My friend seems to act more normal around others. I’ve been trying to get her out the house and off her phone because social media is very triggering for her, but I’m exhausted... being with her for even a few hours is getting so overwhelming and I’m too busy to be there all the time. 

She has anxiety medication but she took it on and off and smokes. Both of which her doctor told her not to do. I can’t convince her to take this more seriously and I also don’t want to tell her I think she has schizophrenia because she would freak out on me.

119,"Been going on since I was in elementary school. If I ever stayed up way too late, I'd start to get overwhelming anxiety and wouldn't be able to put myself to sleep or do anything productive, but I'd start to check for things. When I was younger, it was stuff like school forms, homework or library books. Now I check for things like my keys, debit/credit cards, a throw, etc. It's 5AM and I can't sleep but at least I know I have my SD card from my camera! 

I'm 19F and I know lots of people this age are nocturnal or regularly pull all nighters but not sleeping makes me so anxious, I'm pretty paranoid the entire day following. Usually these sleepless nights full of checking for things preface nervewracking events, like going on a family vacation or, in this case, I'm giving a speech in a day.

i have learned now and grown, how i impacted her still haunts me. so a week ago i apologized to her. I made it clear i didnt expect anything and it wasnt about how i feel but how i made her feel with my stupid actions. i owned them and took full responsibility. i thought it out for so long. it was years ago and i was scared of opening old wounds and idk. i just settled that at the end of the day t was what was right. so i did it.

anyways she finally replied and said she doesnt accept my apology but thanks for it anyway, and that my actions caused her immense pain she can barely cope with. and to never contact her again

that is fair and i understand. i didnt reply to respect her wishes. ppl say ik i finally gave a proper apology at least but that doesnt erase her hurt. i still feel awful and i think ill always feel awful cuz i cant change the past. it feels selfish to talk about how i feel guilty bc it is about how i hurt her with my actions and not me. after all, i hurt her so bad 4 years couldnt repair her mental health. i surely deserve it, and people tell me to forgive myself but who am i to forgive myself when my actions hurt her the most? that seems masochistic to think but it seems selfish to forgive myself. i just want to go back and take it all back, i want this feeling to end. some things dont deserve forgiveness. if what i did doesnt deserve forgiveness what now?",17Jul2020,1
126,"My father is a pretty nice person, but when it comes to anything to do with my mental health he gets annoyed and denies everything. I’ve been diagnosed with autism and anxiety, I also have depression (though that hasn’t been diagnosed, but I’m pretty sure lol) and I have tics (similar to Tourette’s)

Since I was really young, my father wouldn’t let my mum get me diagnosed with anything, even thought it was clear I had mental health issues, like very obvious. Up until they got split I was never tested, even though many teachers said that they suspected something. Once they finally split I was tested and what a surprise! I has autism and anxiety. Even though I had the report my father still denied it, saying that my mother just “put it in my head” and I didn’t actually have autism. He continued to deny it for another year up until now when I started having those tics. He said my tics were just put in my head by my mother and said that I could control it. 

I tried explaining it to him, but as he continued to deny it, I got pretty annoyed and angry (btw, I start crying when I get angry, I’m not good with hiding my emotions lol) anyway, I started crying and he started asking why I was crying and said that he wasn’t angry with me, but he started getting defensive. After a bit of back and forth with him I ended getting myself into a panic attack.

Later the same day, we went to his girlfriends house, and I was still crying. She tried helping me by letting me stay in her room but after a little bit and me finally starting to calm down she came in and demanded I left the room and spent time outside, and told me to “stop making those silly noises” (but guess what, I can’t control it! Yay!) and she told me I was being silly, which to hopefully no ones surprise made me get even more upset and sad.

She left but both my father and his girlfriend came in and asked that I left the room, tried talking to me (btw, when I start to cry or get emotional, my throat kind of closes up and I can’t speak even if I wanted to) and they left. By now I’ve texted my mum asking to go home. She ended up calling my dad when I couldn’t tell her what was going on and he went outside and started to yell at her. For over half and hour I sat there hearing everything he said and it made me feel worse. He was just being defensive and denied everything.

His girlfriend came back in and tried talking to me again and demanded I went outside. When I refused she stormed off. Later my dad came back in doing the same thing and I spent an hour there trying to calm down but just being set off again when they walked in demanding I left.

I texted my mum again, asking to go home and she kept telling me to wait it out. After a bit my dad came in asking if I wasn’t ex to go home, after a bit I nodded and he drove me home. But not before the cherry in top of the story. The girlfriend asked my dad (quite loudly) “is that seriously what’s happening?” And he said yes that I shouldn’t have to be there if I wasn’t okay to be there (thanks, I guess?) and she asked if I was at least going to say goodbye.

He came back into the room and asked for me to say bye, which I did. I even said sorry to her. As I was walking out I heard her say to me.

“You’re being really disappointing! We were meant to do stuff this weekend!” In an accusatory tone. I left the house and my dad drove me home and I apologised again.

And how here we are, hope you enjoyed the show!

TLDR: Dad gets mad at my mental health, yells at my mum and dad’s girlfriend yells at me.

So i have this thing where I obsess over a random set of disturbing and upsetting things that make me feel sick. These include:
- Licking a dustpan after sweeping
- eating a bug
- a bug goes in my ear/nose
- covid testing (when i got tested the thing in my nose hurt really bad and disturbed me deeply for some reason, I couldn't sleep that night because I was obsessing over it and cried because it was so disturbing/upsetting to me)

Its really fucking disgusting and it makes me feel sick and awful and its messing up my sleep because when I lay down I start to think about these things.

I just found out through various sources and doctors that I suffer from depression, I've been having symptoms for the last two years. I have really bad insomnia aswell(common in my family), sometimes I can't sleep for days. And to top it all off my girlfriend broke up with me, I'm 16 btw she was my first girlfriend, we've been together for 1.5 years. So all in all this made it worse. I just do not have a clue how to tackle all of this. My parents are supportive but they divorced so most of the time our talks just and up with one of them ranting on the other.

One of my friends said ""GET OUT OF THE ROAD! YOU'LL GET RAN OVER"" and I said something like ""Oh thank goodness! Finally!""

135,"So I was seeing a girl recently, it was fairly casual I guess I wasn't too optimistic about the whole thing because I recently got out of a relationship. We spent about every other day together over the last 2-3 weeks. Kissed, had sex all that jazz. Then 2 days ago she told me she wasn't sure about me due to my constant worrying and negative outlook. Sadly, these are things my ex also found difficult in putting up with me.

Basically I feel like I will always fall short of people's expectations for me. I live alone, I am working in a near empty office. Every thing feels empty and isolated. And I'll acknowledge that I am reaching out for romance due to loneliness or the need to fill a void. People keep telling me that I can't love someone else until I love myself. In 26 years I cannot be sure if I've ever loved myself and I fear that I will never love myself. And although I find myself connecting socially with other ""rejects"" where we drink until dawn and use drugs and these people seem to accept me this is not the life I want for myself. I am afraid I'll be alone forever or worse end up somewhere I don't belong. 

Before someone asks, I am going back to therapy next week and I'll be talking to my doctor about my increased anxiety in the last few weeks but I am genuinely afraid nobody will ever fully accept me with all my baggage, negativity, anxiety, sadness, grief, loneliness, pain.",17Jul2020,1

I seriously feel so abandoned if I wasn't acknowledged or appreciated by someone and it makes me feel so selfish, because all I've been doing is attention seeking without a clear image of myself or my thoughts at all.

Exaggerating things also kinda made my emotions more intense - although I'm not sure if it was originally already that bad to begin with.

It's to the point I say people abuse me so that someone would give a damn about me. Though I've been neglected and beaten all through childhood, I think I'm fortunately living fairly fine currently but my hatred for my parents just keep getting worse despite how they haven't been doing anything to me anymore.

146,"If someone asks you a question about how much you care about your [mental well-being](https://fixinfos.com/mental-health/mental-health/), think about the answer you can give. Perhaps in your hectic life, you have little time for mental well-being. Or you may think it’s not that important. But when it comes to mental health, I expect to discuss the worst of the illnesses we hear about. Schizophrenia is one of the most severe forms of mental illness.

**Schizophrenia**

This is a severe mental illness. Differentiation of the actions of the mind is the effect of the way the person thinks, feels and acts. Sometimes he shows himself and others to be risky. And they rarely respond by disrupting the functioning of the mind. Generally, they are deceived by various voices and illusions. Unlike other mental disorders, the symptoms often show up at a young age. Ties with society are undermined.

The reasons for this are the social environment, the family environment as well as the genetic status and the long-term use of various forms of recreational use (LSD). Whether a single symptom is present for early diagnosis or a combination of symptoms is still a problem.

Basically it affects thinking ability, but then it affects the behavior. Frequently angry and stressed, their lifespan is 10–15 years shorter than the average man’s. This is the most common disease with the common denominator being positive. The patient is affected by various hallucinations, sounds, and thoughts. Simply put, the patient is deluded.

**Causes of Disease**

Which you are most prone to contract the disease before reaching adulthood. Overall, about 40% are male and 23% are female. Genes are also likely to be infected, but researchers have shown that not a single gene can cause the disease. It may also affect the environment in which they live. For example, exposure to the polluted environment may include psychosocial factors. Excessive drug use is also a factor. Various pills and syrups are good examples of this.

 **Diagnosis**

Individuals’ actions and responses are used predominantly to judge [schizophrenia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizophrenia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354443). If there is any doubt about them, they will study their history (medical and psychiatrist). The first step in treating any other illnesses that may be causing the schizophrenia. Blood tests, such as blood tests, can detect these conditions. Treatment is primarily focused on treating symptoms and eliminating them, as the cause is yet to be discovered. Treatment can help control the symptoms. There are many side effects of these medications. The management of schizophrenia does not depend on medicine, Communication is also important, for example, to educate the patient about the condition, be friendly with them and listen to them.",17Jul2020,1

151,For context I’m a 24 year old mail who graduated college last August with a degree in material science engineering. I was working under contract for a company called BASF until my contract ended in January. I won’t lie this pandemic has me feeling many things. I feel incompetent because I haven’t been able to get a job and I feel constantly depressed because of the fact that I feel my life is going nowhere. I constantly feel that whenever things going well in my life that something or someone has to mess it all up. I tried trading on Robinhood to make money and everything was going well. I was 20 grand up but this Monday one bad trade fucked me over and I lost all my profit.  I just feel depressed because of it. Everyone in my family keeps saying “ at least you don’t have it as bad as others” and while that’s true that doesn’t help me it just makes it seem like they want me to shut the fuck up. I also have this feeling of anger that I kinda feel ashamed of. I love my brother to death but for some reason I constantly feel angry at the fact that he got a lucky break. I was the one who studied constantly in college and highschool while he just wanted to fuck around. He didn’t major in engineering but he majored in English and our father set him up with a cozy position as a sales engineer for a communications firm.

152,"I don’t even know if anyone is even going to read this or if I’m even going to get any feedback but i just feel weird like I’m a shell of myself.

I keep thinking of myself as 2 different people, the person who I actually am and the person I should be for other people. The actual me plays this other person like a puppet. Calculating the perfect response and action that is appropriate to the situation and the person I’m talking to. Some days it’s so bad that when I get home from work or spending time with friends or family or even my boyfriend (sorta that’s another story for another time) I’m so exhausted and end up feeling no one actually knows who I am or they know a gist of me but they don’t seem to care to dive any deeper which then I don’t say anything.

I’ve been doing this thing in the past almost 10 years where if someone doesn’t ask me about a certain situation or event in my life I don’t share it because if they don’t care why should I bother.  I just quit my job for a lot of personal reasons and I haven’t told anyone because no one asked what is going on in my life or if people from my old job asked why I was leaving I’d give them a water down version. 

I feel I can’t go to my friends because as soon as I start talking they seem to devalue what I’m saying “everyone is stressed” or “i feel that way” but truly don’t understand the severity of it, that I feel alone and cold inside every day. 

I don’t know if it’s just me being dramatic or if something is actually going on but I feel like I’m 2 people and the actual me is watching this other people that looks just like me life this life that seems so fake. I’m in the process of getting myself “back to normal” after my 3 months of breakdowns but my entire life just seems off and uncomfortable.

153,"I’m writing because I would like advice regarding how I can help my friend as I am truly concerned. 

My friend of 25+ years has always had anxiety but this year it’s gone from bad to scary. 

This morning at 5am I got this message which I believe is a pretty good summation of their problem:

“I‘m losing this fight. It's not the same as you. My entire life has been turned upside down cause of how unstable I am. Why would I ever touch a drug, I'm not an addict. I don't even think I have a drug problem, I think I have mental illness problem and in the last 4 or 5 years, it has gone out of control. Every once in awhile I get a little clarity like now, and I look at what is happening,  and I feel like I'm someone else. I dont know how to stop it. I wish you could understand. Everything was OK, than bam, it just got worse. It's gotten worse and worse. I'm losing everything. It's not just snapping myself out of it. There is no snapping out of it. Maybe when I was younger. I'm completely out of control. I feel like someone else 5 times a day. Drugs just make it worse, I know this, but I feel like I have no conscious anymore. Like I can't tell the difference between right and wrong. I just act on things, I would have never done before. Then after its done, I just don't know why I even did whatever. It didn't use to be like this. I had control over most things, and I could make better decissions. This has taken my ability to take care of my kids, take care of my wife, hold a stable job, have goals, happiness....its a little more than just sadness. I could have the best cheerleader in the world. Just having someone doesn't fix the problem. I'll make more mistakes and push those people away.  I feel so alone. I'm so tired of being tired and looking for answerers. I think almost everything I have suffered in the last 5 to 6 years has been almost all mental health. I felt something wrong, I couldn't tell what was wrong. I found every other reason to be sick. I think its always been the same. I could barely control  it years ago. Now, I have no control. I cant tell myself I'm sad and move on. It would be like cutting my arm open and while the blood pours out, I just tell myself it's ok.”

I will get messages like these daily. I believe I’m the only person who is receiving these messages and, although I am the parent figure my friend groups this is something even I do not have the capacity to deal with. It is beginning to become too much for even me to handle the constant onslaught of this friends mental illness. 

My fear is my friend is fast approaching or has already reached a mental schism that they will not be able to come back from if they are not provided help soon.

What should I do to help because unfortunately I believe these are calls for help and my brand pick yourself up by your bootstraps work hard isn’t going to help this friend anymore than it would help a dementia patient.",17Jul2020,1

158,"hello everyone. I don’t know what flair to give this as it is also some kind of vent but most of all: a cry for help. 

have been struggling for the concept of death for as long as I can think. As a child I learned very quickly about cancer, not through experience or a relative or anyone with cancer but through it being in the news. got me terrified.

had my first thought about death really when I was in an elevator when I was about 8 years old. I was thinking of where we go after we die, why we exist and that if something would happen to the Earth, we would all be dead, basically a sudden realisation of mortality and questioning what comes next packed into one thought that lasted for 6 seconds. I suddenly got dizzy thinking about all of this. this is a very vivid memory of my early childhood (I’m 23 now).

most of my life been struggling with health anxiety, especially when I’m alone, throughout my teenage years, but wasn’t as severe.

2 years ago I moved countries for Uni, met my first ever boyfriend who I love very dearly, lost some friends and got into adult worries regarding finance, relationship,... my post history might give you some ideas of what I have been going through mentally the past 2 years if anyone interested in understanding my mental health background.

been in and out of therapy, took what I need from it so far and am taking a break from it right now as I am in an “Avoidance” phase, basically I am trying to avoid topics that could upset me.

I like to discuss the meaning of life and consider myself a rather spiritual and philosophical person. I have found comfort in understanding astrology and it gives me a feeling of understanding a deeper meaning behind everything (please don’t judge if you’re not into it, it’s really personal for me). 

but I have figured that health anxiety is just a symptom of the cause which is my general fear of dying or somebody I love dying.

sometimes I read a random post on reddit and somebody mentions their loved one passed away and I immediately worry and get very depressed how life can be so short and how things can be left unsaid and unexperienced. I realised I don’t know how to handle death at all and I don’t like to think of it but it crosses my mind more often than it probably should. 

I ask you guys, how do you guys cope with the concept of death? And while I know therapy is helpful, I am not sure if it would work in this case. Please leave your thoughts. I would like to get you guys’ opinions.",17Jul2020,1
159,"I watched Fight Club yesterday, and as much as that film is great, I've been feeling really weird and out of place after watching it, sad and depressed again after feeling okay-ish for 2 weeks or so. Does anyone else relate to this?",17Jul2020,1
160,"I have been with my husband for 10 years and married for 2 of them. Before we were together, we had been friends for over 30 years. We have been through it all. He dated one of my best friends when he knew I was in love with him. After that, we didn't talk for 6 years. I initiated contact with him after the 6 years and we started talking again. Yes, I was still in love with him at the time, but he told me that ""we would never be together"". Crushed and devastated by this, I called an ex and ended up sleeping with him. After this, my (now) husband and I ended up being together and getting married. 

When him and I were not talking for 6 years, I was in a dark place. Had substance issues, failed relationships and had a child out of wedlock. (The best thing that could have happened to me, as i quickly got sober.)

The reason for this long explanation is that my husband slut shames me for the 6 years he CHOSE not to be a part of my life. And, he calls me a cheater for sleeping with an ex when we were not even together. 

I feel as though something changed with this last fight we got in when he slut shamed me &amp; called me a cheater, yet again. It happens every time we fight. It hurts. I am not a slut or a cheater. 

He wants to do marriage counseling, but I don't have the fight in me. I am sick of being shamed for a past during a time in my life that hhe chose to not to be a part of.

161,"I’m 27[F] and I’ve been on a higher dose of Klonopin (2mg once a day) for several years for anxiety, BPD and other conditions. However, I’ve started to notice that it’s starting to give me a “hungover” feeling in the mornings to where it makes it difficult to wake up, I feel super drowsy and depressed, and sometimes I even end up calling out at my job because I feel like crap. It’s becoming an issue.

I’ve even followed my doctors advice by cutting them in half and taking smaller doses at an earlier time of day, and it still has the same effect no matter what. I know that Klonopin has a longer half-life, and this is probably why I’m having this issue. 

Has anyone had success with any other benzos that don’t make you feel this way? I’m a little scared because I’m so used to Klonopin and it’s helped me a lot, but I can’t keep having these issues.

I have always struggled with mental health, and in the past year I’ve gotten really into fitness. I am in shape but when I have worse than normal mental health days my workouts are greatly affected.

For instance, on a good day I run 5 miles in 50 minutes with about two walking breaks. However , days like today I could barely do 3.5 miles in 37 minutes with about 6 walking breaks.
It affects my strength training days too, but not as much. 

Does anyone else have this issue? If so, how do you combat it? Should I just be happy I got out of bed and went on a run?

IDK if this changes anything, but the mental illnesses I have are Depression, Severe general anxiety. I have been getting treated for them for about 5 years now. I’m not on medication currently, but I am in therapy.

TLDR: when I have bad mental health days my workouts aren’t nearly as good. 

Any advice is appreciated!",17Jul2020,1
166,"I grew up with an emotionally abusive parent. Whenever I did anything percieved as wrong I would be screamed at, sometimes for hours and pushed around. Then my whole family would.

168,"Madalasa's lullaby is a part of a story from the ‘Markandeya Purana’, an ancient Vedic text. In the story, Madalasa, the enlightened Queen of Ritadhwaja sings this lullaby to her kids. When the child cries, instead of diverting the child’s attention with material objects, she choose to introduce him to the Ultimate Truth. And that truth is sung in the form of a sweet lullaby called Madalasa Upadesha.  

I was recently going through alot of trauma in my life, I came across a version of this poem sung by an Indian lady. I would close my eyes and listen to the song in my head while remembering what each line meant. This really helped me so I though that it might help someone in times of need :D

169,"So for background I'm a 24 year old man &amp; I'm not at my lowest which was a couple of years ago now, but the thing which I've noticed is how dramatically my mood can switch, not just day to day but by the course of several hours. 

I can go from feeling upbeat &amp; reasonably confident to an empty emotional wreck in tears in just a few hours.

Even my friends have commented on this about how I can go from fine to just overboard pretty quickly. A couple of my friends have said they have distanced from me due to this saying I'm too taxing at times to be around.

This also feeds into the the fear of abandonment I have. I've always felt that people will eventually abandon me the more they know me &amp; I remember not being invited to something once and it made me furious. 

I've noticed my temperament has gotten much worse. I spilled over some spice I was making for my dinner, I swore at the top of my lungs &amp; threw the bowl on the floor breaking it.

I even got into a heated argument with my brother &amp; I punched him, stormed off angrily &amp; punched a hole in the wall as well (nearly killing myself because I didn't realise there were electrical cables millimetres from where I did it). Like I've never seen eye-to-eye with him but not to the extent I'd lash out like that.

When it comes to suicidal thoughts, I genuinely can't remember a day in nearly 3 years now when the thought of suicide hasn't crossed my mind. The intensity of these thoughts can be affected by my changing mood &amp; sometimes I even get into the planning stages. I haven't attempted in a long while however, not since march 2018.

I remember discussing my problems with a good friend who holds a degree in psychology &amp; she said that she didn't want to put ideas in my head but it sounds like suspected BPD. 

After going through the 9 supposed symptoms, I'd say I have 7 of them pretty concrete. Of course I dont want to say I have it as it's a dangerous &amp; disrespectful to self diagnose myself.

As I said I'm not at my lowest when I was clinically depressed &amp; did nothing, but i am by far &amp; away the most unstable mentally I've ever been in my life.

I need therapy, I even posted how I'm looking into therapy on a different subreddit (unrelated to mental health) the other day. I'm just cautious &amp; reluctant to do so simply because I don't know where to go next &amp; how to do it. Also I'm kind of scared to confront it but at the same time clearly something is wrong if its BPD or not. 

The reason I feel more comfortable coming to a forum of strangers (friendly ones of course) is the anonymity it grants me. My relationship with my family makes it hard to discuss my problems with them.

If anyone can help me out I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you &amp; stay safe",17Jul2020,1

I recently randomly had a conversation about my past school life with my boyfriend and a lot of things I thought I had forgotten or just didn't pay any mind to about my past with bullying came up. Ever since then I feel like it suddenly became 'a thing'. Before that I just didn't think too much about school times but now I feel like I opened a dam and I don't know how to keep things from spilling out?

It's nothing serious, just some bullying stuff many went through but it does affect me now that it is in my mind again and I have the weird urge of telling everyone about it (like my mum or housemates) and it's making me very confused.
Should I act upon that, is it normal to feel that way? I am not a private person in general but I feel like bringing it up randomly a lot and I really don't know where that urge could be coming from. Do I just want validation?

177,"I’m new to this sub and actually new to trying to figure out what’s going on with me.

I’ve been having what I think are panic attacks the past couple years. I generally have managed them ok, and try to forget them after they’re gone. Lately though they’ve been getting worse. I ended up in an ambulance/ER late one night recently when I woke up thinking my heart was stopping. Embarrassing when my vitals were all ok! They couldn’t find anything wrong with me. I woke up yesterday feeling like I couldn’t breathe properly, which eventually subsided but had my heart rate elevated for awhile. Frustrating, because I knew I was fine, but still couldn’t shake the feeling I might not be!

I’ve struggled with anxiety my whole life, but Ive found ways to struggle through, and am pretty successful and content with how my life is right now. The panic attacks are a little scary though..

Went to my Dr (nurse assistant is who saw me, actually) after my ambulance episode to talk about it and her advice was to basically call my employer’s Employee Assistance Program line to see if they have free resources. I haven’t done that yet, but did sign up for Talkspace yesterday through my insurance benefits, and have connected with a Psychiatrist. So we’ll see how that goes.

Am I doing this right? Is there anything I should be looking for, or doing, to cope with this?",17Jul2020,1

He suggested I look into neurologists... I also still see bright spot long after I look away from lights or bright objects. 

I also have a slight ringing in my ears. I only hear it when I'm focused or stressed. I always hear it when it's really quiet but I can hear it anywhere given I'm stressed or focused on something. This seems to be more common. 

What do you guys think? It hasn't been as bad in the past year and I haven't needed my yellow glasses, I just want to make sure it's not a symptom of something serious. Any suggestions on what I should look into?

184,"I (17F) come from an average middle class family. We’ve never had major financial issues, and I feel pretty lucky for that. 
But since I was a kid I have been around wealthy people, and sometimes it didn’t make me feel good.
As a kid I envied my cousins. They live in a huge house with three floors, a pool, a small soccer field and a pizza oven and I was envious because I lived in a small apartment and also because we were never invited to that big house! Yeah I was a silly kid. But now I’m still envious when I see them carelessly drop their iPhones and replace them with the newest model one day later.

I just graduated high school, and most kids from my school are rich. When I was younger I envied them a lot more than I do now. Once a girl in my grade posted an Instagram story asking if she should buy a Bape hoodie. If you never heard of it, Bape is a Japanese streetwear brand, known for its iconic [“shark hoodies.”](https://stockx.imgix.net/products/streetwear/Bape-Shark-Full-Zip-Hoodie-Camo-Sleeve-Black.jpg?fit=fill&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;w=700&amp;h=500&amp;auto=format,compress&amp;q=90&amp;trim=color&amp;updated_at=1538080256&amp;w=1000) (At least, I think they’re iconic.) At the time I was 14, I loved BTS, and once in a dance video one of the members was wearing a Bape hoodie and I liked it, and I wanted to buy one. Through that girl’s story, I found out the cheapest Bape hoodie costs more than $300! There was a poll in the story, she asked if she should buy the hoodie, and I voted “no”. I was mature enough to know more than $300 is an unreasonable price for a single sweatshirt, but I would have hated walking through the hallways and seeing another girl wear one.

Mostly, I envied other kids from my school because of all their experiences. Their parents are less strict, have lower expectation for their children’s schoolwork, and let them do whatever they want. These days I’m seeing countless IG stories from people in my school. They’re all going on holidays by themselves, even abroad. They go clubbing and they’re still out at dawn. They go to concerts on the other side of the country. And my parents have never let me do any of that. Not to mention that none of them seems worried about the pandemic.",17Jul2020,1
185,"Sorry if this makes a sound sense, my mind is racing because of al the shit that’s going on right now so I’m trying really hard to get my thoughts straight.

To give some background, I’m a 15 year old female who obviously still lives with family. My mum has had to deal with my sisters manipulative behaviour for ages and is over it. When I was 9, she had to go into a mental ward for a few days and I still remember that time very well even though I didn’t understand why she had to go. But now i do. 

Recently, she has been having meltdowns, shouting, arguing with other siblings over extremely tiny things (like when she was asked to do the dishes once) She has a tendency to completely blow things out of proportion.

And when she’s done with those meltdowns, she acts like everything is normal again the next day. 

I’m always worrying about my sister. I feel like she could literally end her life at any moment whenever tensions are high. It’s scary, and it’s so tiring. She’s a very delusional person, as much as I hate to say, but it’s true. She keeps praying to God as if he’s going to fucking do anything about her situation. Praying is fine of course, but she completely depends on her faith to keep her somewhat sane. Saying stuff like “I’m a princess of God” and “God made me this way so you need to learn how to deal with it”

She doesn’t want to get professional help. She says she doesn’t trust them. She won’t help herself. In fact, she doesn’t even believe she needs help.

I can’t even imagine how my mum must feel. She’s a nurse who occasionally works double shifts and has bills to pay. My dad pretty much is not in the picture. My family have said over and over that he’s a narcissist (which we don’t know, but he definitely shows signs) 

I tried to call my dad asking if he could at least come over and take my sister just to calm her down while we wait for the ambulance. (This is right now by the way, we’re still waiting) But he says he’s busy doing something. Which is so fucking annoying because as a father, he should drop whatever he’s doing and come and help his daughter!!! He never cares and it drives me insane.

We as a family, are extremely tired. We’ve been trying our absolute best to get help.

I am aching for help/advice. As much I want to, I can’t even cry because I’ve been having to deal with this for so long, keeping a facade as if everything is fine when it really isn’t so I’m basically numb to all of this. This is going to ruin my mental health.",17Jul2020,1

188,"Hello everyone. Just as the title says, if you believe, you will succeed. I shall give an example of this....

- Today I received some good news! After 3 long and hard years of university, the constant assignments, the researching, the effort, the hard work that comes with it.... I have successful got my degree in Sport Management. I could not have done this without believe in MYSELF.🎓

This is just one of million examples of how people succeeded by believing in themselves. Sure, I will admit, at times I struggled, almost gave up, but I kept on going. You’ve got to keep going, grind the days out, work as hard as you can, motivate yourself. But, unfortunately, some can’t come to terms with that sort of attitude. For millions of people around the world, this is the attitude they carry with them, day in and day out. 

It’s time to change that. It’s time for YOU to believe in yourself, you have a future. Trust me, you do. You have to believe in your own destiny, that you will succeed. Along the way, you will meet a lot of rejection and pit stops, it won’t be a straight path, there will be detours. Life doesn’t go as simple as you think, you will fall, but it’s all about rising from it, while you’re at it, becoming a better version of yourself. 

The strongest factor for success is self-esteem. Believe YOU can do it, believe YOU can be the best version of yourself, it isn’t going to be like that all the time, believe YOU deserve it and believe that YOU’ll come out of this as a stronger person. 

You don’t need anyone to believe in you, as long as you believe in yourself. But, that’s where I’m also wrong, another person believes in you, and that’s.... ME. I fully believe in you. You’re going to come out of this a much better and stronger person. 

I believe in you. That’s all I’m asking, is that YOU believe in YOUrself.

192,"I honestly don't know what to do. I'm just lost. I'm not panic or anything, I'm just lost.

Maybe it's just the results of me making a chain of bad decisions. But now, I don't know, I can't deny it anymore. It's been 3 entire months and I've been feeling like shits every single day. It's been 3 entire months of me trying to convince myself that it's gonna get better sooner or later, that it's just fucking I don't know, weird teenage angst like people always say, but I've finally ran out of patience. 

Today it finally hit me that 3 entire months have gone by, I have lost that awareness of time for so damn long, and I just realized that I've been living like an empty shell, I forget just mundane things like random words (even in my mother tongue) too many times for it to be normal, I have lost motivation to do the things I used to love like drawing, writing, and participating in social projects, I am no longer able to express myself properly, both verbally and through text messages.

Prior to this, I have had times when I feel like shits, but then at the beginning of this year (during the quarantine) I've actually managed to be better. I have found a new group of friends who shared thpe same interest as I do, they have changed my outlook on life for the better. I actually felt optimistic, I actually believe things can be better, I had good sleeping routine and felt confident about myself for once. I was no longer a bitter person that I had been in the past, I felt so happy and fulfilled. 

But when it ended, reality came at me like a fucking bitch. I ended up even worse than I was before. The people whom I thought were my friends turned out to be asshats, so I decided to cut them off due to the thing they've done/said. But I have since had moments when I questioned myself if it was too harsh on them. But then I remember the things they did (one ghosted me during quarantine, one called me stupid, then proceeded to brag about their amazing background/family compared to my terrible one, and then they both ditched me to team up with each other during a competition that we all attended, great) and how they never sincirely gave me an apology for it, and I just get mad again. Then the cycle just repeats itself. For we're in this social group together, I also cut myself out of that circle too, only kept contact with two people I kinda trust. School had been such a terrible place to be at too. My teachers had been neglectful toward the class and went through with teaching the lessons as fast as possible. Then my parents' reactions to my grades + the ""stupid"" comment my friend made just completely tore down the self-esteem I'd built during the previous months. The social projects/clubs which I'm a part of as one of the core members have been failing as well, because nobody cared anymore. I was really lonely, not in the way that I don't have any friend, because I did. But I'm too scared to share too much to them as well, because I don't want to burden them with my own problems, it's not like there is something they could do about it anyway. I couldn't help but sometimes just slipped out some of my thoughts though, and it just hurts and makes me feel guilty because fuck, I just don't want it, what kind of person do it to their friends. Things just piled up and once again, I messed up my sleep schedule, and all my relationships because I can't express any other emotions than just, empty and sadness.

I have tried to ""just be positive"", ""things arent that bad"". I have tried to drown myself in work, but it also doesn't work, just most of the time I don't really put the effort in, and procastinate, and finish things at the last minute.

TODAY is the first thing that I completed everything on my morning checklist!!! For the past week, I couldn’t bring myself to do 3-4 of the, but I did them all this morning!!! I’m ridiculously proud and I have such a huge smile on my face. I can definitely say bullet journaling is a great way feel good about yourself! 
Thank you to everyone who read. I hope you’re day is amazing, and not too hard. Thank you for getting out of bed and breathing. I love you",17Jul2020,1

197,"Last week we talked about the difference between [healthy and unhealthy expectations](https://heem.substack.com/p/the-effects-of-expectations). Expectations become unhealthy when they are unrealistic and have high emotional investment. When this happens and your expectations aren’t met, you will be severely disappointed.

This is why managing expectations are important. They are subconscious and invisible filters that directly impact how we perceive the world. They influence and even distort how we experience life. In this way, expectations affect our mental health.

Therefore managing expectations is an important tool we can use to pay down Emotional Debt and fits into the “Prevent” stage of [PAALP](https://heem.substack.com/p/how-to-pay-down-emotional-debt) (Plan-Act-Assess-Learn-Prevent).

By managing our expectations, we can interrupt cycles of severe disappointment and break negative patterns of behavior. Let’s take a look and apply this tool in the following two areas of relationships:

* Expectations of Self
* Expectations of Others

## Managing Expectations of Self

When we have unrealistic expectations of ourselves, we are creating an environment to tear down our self-esteem. The disappointment we feel when we fail ends up lowering our confidence and breeds self-criticism. If this cycle of negativity repeats enough, it will turn into hypercriticism and even self-hate.

One of the tools I’ve used to help break this cycle of negativity is acknowledging that there are things that I’m good at and things that I’m bad at.

In [a previous letter](https://heem.substack.com/p/how-to-explore-the-emotion-iceberg), I shared a story that I would get angry when I played pick-up basketball and that it was rooted in having unrealistic expectations of myself. Everytime I failed to live up to my own expectations, I started beating myself up. This eventually turned into hypercriticism and low self-esteem.

I paid down this debt by reframing the expectations I had of myself. I acknowledged that I was getting older and therefore slower. I acknowledged that I was coming back from an injury and would need time to practice. By recognizing my biological and physical limitations, I realized it was unrealistic for me to think I could go back to the level I was playing at before.

Another tool I used to help break this cycle of negativity was positive self talk. Rather than beating myself up everytime I made a mistake, I told myself that it was okay to make a mistake. That I just needed to practice more. That I’ll do better next time. By replacing hypercriticism with positive self-talk, I was able to enjoy pickup basketball again.

## Managing Expectations of Others

When we have unrealistic expectations of others, we are damaging the relationship. Our disappointment seeps into the way we interact and view the other person. The damage we inflict on others can be especially harsh if we hold positions of power such as a being a boss, parent, or a significant other.

However, the disappointment can affect us as well. It can breed anger, frustration, and resentment in the relationship because from our perspective the other person is constantly letting us down.

### Explore the Expectation

One of the tools I’ve used to break this negative relational pattern is to ask myself, “Why do I have this expectation? What is it that I really want from them?”

The reason for this is that expectations communicate desire. For example:

&gt;I expected you to do the dishes.

This statement isn’t about the dishes. It more tied to the feeling of disrespect or perhaps sense of betrayal because they did not keep their promise. Therefore what this expectation really is communicating was a desire for respect.

&gt;I expected you to be there for me.

This statement expresses a deeper issue of not feeling cared for. Therefore what this expectation really is communicating is a desire to be loved.

&gt;I expected you to get straight A’s this semester.

This statement sets a high standard based around performance between a parent and a child. If you’re Asian, you’re probably very familiar with this expectation. The underlying desire that is being communicated is that the parent wants what is best for the child. Another one could be to build up a good reputation as a parent amongst their peers.

### Accept Their Limitations

The next step in this process is to develop a realistic and objective perspective of what the other person can or can’t do. This is crucial. If we don’t do this, then we are introducing unfair standards into the relationship and creating an environment engineered to foster disappointment and criticism.

The truth is sometimes people simply can’t do what we want or need. Sometimes this is something they can work on and sometimes it’s not. Accepting this truth will help to decide whether to continue with the relationship or move on.

By discovering the underlying desire of our expectations and understanding the limitations of the other person, we can strategize ways to prevent negative cycles within the relationship from recurring. This can include:

* Finding alternative ways the other person can meet your desires.
* Accepting that it isn’t possible for the other person to meet your expectations.
* Ending the relationship.

199,"So basically I have this feeling where I have to workout for a hour everyday . No matter the weather , if I’m sick , if I’m tired , or even hurt I have to do it . I would only eat one meal in the morning then won’t eat nothing else until I do my workout for the day . It’s really messing with my social life because I won’t do or go anywhere unless I have done my workout. It’s also causing me to get OCD . Like say if I’m working out I must have this one thing in my head before I begin or stop a type of exercise and if I don’t have that right image I have to think about it again and time it right or I’ll even sometimes do the whole workout again. Then even if I’m done with my workout I continue to have to think of things and time it right and do it again again till I get what Is right for me to rest easy . It occurs before I go to sleep , turn off a faucet , close a door , and even before I step in the shower I have to pose right and flex my abs in the mirror before I go in the shower and  time some in my head completely right and sometimes it take me 5 min to even step in the water because I keep doing it again to I see my abs in the best lighting and having the image In my head simultaneously . I need help getting over it but it so hard for me because if I don’t exercise I would barely eat anything the whole day or even nothing .",17Jul2020,1

I’ve not been happy or content with myself for over 5 years yet my parents just keep on saying that I’m fine but I don’t feel fine. I feel isolated and overwhelmed. I’m not happy about anything in my life and they just don’t want to hear me out. They don’t take it seriously. There is something wrong with me but I just wanted some help to find out what’s going on and I hate that they don’t want to back me up on it. They just want that golden child whos always happy and gets amazing grades and never ever complains. I’m not that and they think it’s me being irresponsible when I’m reality I don’t have any motivation or drive in life anymore.,17Jul2020,1
204,"My best friend and I have been friends for many, many years, and even though I have never explicitly explained or labelled my struggles with mental health as I find it difficult to open up, she is clearly aware that I do have my struggles and this means I sometimes don’t want to do certain things, such as meeting in large groups of people, or meeting new people.

Recently, we had a falling out, as we had arranged to meet up after not seeing each other for around 3 weeks, and last minute she decided to invite a friend of hers I have never met without checking with me first. I was disappointed as I was excited to see her, but I didn’t express any anger or frustration and simply explained I wouldn’t feel comfortable doing that so she should still meet with the other friend to avoid letting her down and we can meet another day. In response to this, she expressed a lot of anger and frustration towards me, and made comments basically saying that she can’t be bothered with me making a big deal as it’s just a get together, even though I didn’t at all make a big deal and simply explained it was out of my comfort zone, and she is aware of that as I have backed out of plans in the past when last minute changes such as this are made. I didn’t respond to these messages as they upset me, and we haven’t spoken since.

The situation has lead to me think I am weird and I am a problem, but I’m not sure I should feel this way as surely she should be accepting and supportive of my issues and respect my boundaries, as you would with anyone, regardless of their mental health?

I think I am just seeking the opinion of others, which is probably a bad idea considering how paranoid I already am, but I just don’t know what to do or think about the situation :(

P.S. I should note that this isn’t the first time something like this has happened, as she has made rather trivialising comments regarding my mental health in the past too.",17Jul2020,1
205,"Hi, this is my first time here, but I’m going through it y’all. The past few weeks have been some of my scariest. I’ve never been actively suicidal for this long (usually if I’m active it lasts a few hours, this has been going on for weeks) and it 100% has to do with my psychiatrist upping my anti-depressants a few weeks ago to manage my anxiety. All it did was send me into a PTSD anxiety, depressive spiral. I usually only have panic attacks a couple times in 2-4 months, and I’ve been having them almost daily, along with the suicidality. My romantic relationship has completely fallen apart because of my mental health. He can’t handle it anymore, and I understand that. He needs to make himself his priority, and I am my priority. But I’m just hurting a lot. I just want to feel better. I want to remember how happiness feels. How peace feels. And I’m on the road to that. My mom came to get me from my college town, and I’m going to my hometown this weekend to have a physical support system. I have friends in my hometown that are willing to spend time with me and talk with me. I won’t feel so alone anymore. My psychiatrist put me on an aggressive treatment plan to get me onto meds that we know will work and to manage my current levels of anxiety. This is my first time on lorazepam, and it helps so much. They’re supposed to help the transition off of my old meds onto my new ones.

206,"I'm a 15 year old male from Israel.

In my area, mental health isn't taken seriously and it saddens me. I think my overeating disorder started when I was in the 5th grade, which means I was 10 when it started. And for the 5 years of me having my overeating disorder, I only noticed it last year.

None of my parents noticed that I had it for 5 years, thinking about it now, it was so easy and obvious to see that I had one, I always ate fast, ate a lot, always binge eating and I always get hungry very very fast. But I guess this stuff isn't taught or known here, I mean, I can't blame them.

A couple of days ago I had the courage to tell my mom about it, and I was surprised that she had never heard of an overeating disorder. Anyways, we talked for a bit and I started telling her about my overeating disorder. I thought that telling my mom would at least make me eat less, but I think it made me eat more. Each time I eat, I convince myself that the next time I will just eat less or not eat, but I know that I'm lying to myself.

I can't stop it. It's like a demon inside me that forces me to eat more, even though I know it's bad for me, I can't stop myself.

It's awfully disgusting. I am certain that with my current lifestyle, beating my overeating disorder is impossible. 

Should I see a physcologist? Are there any pills for this? Should I go on a diet? Should I seek help?

207,"I (18F) have struggled with mental illness since I was 11, I have been to the doctors about it and have been diagnosed with depression and an anxiety disorder. As a result of these I have self harmed frequently. I have never been properly diagnosed with an eating disorder because I have always been too scared to admit  it while I was under 18, but for years now i have gone in and out of periods where i either very harshly limit my eating, or I go through cycles of binging and purging via throwing up. 

In both the self harm and the eating issues I always wonder if I'm faking it, because I feel like I have some sort of control over it, and I'm making the conscious decision to hurt myself in these ways. I really don't know what is real and what's not, and I feel like it's my fault I put myself through it because I seem to have such a conscious ability to decide whether or not to partake in the actions.

214,"I’ve always had anxiety, ptsd, depression &amp; ocd.
 Diagnosed once when I was 10, again at 16 again at 19 then 23 (now)

My disorders didn’t become severe until a year ago, I couldn’t tell you why I wish I knew. My depression and anxiety got so bad that I had to give my weapons to a friend to hold not because I wanted to kill my self but was scared of what I’d do in a panic episode.

I’m turning anorexic and I hate it so much. I want nothing more then to gain weight. I’m 23 5’6 weigh 114.
When I was good I weighed 128.

I get nauseous everyday from my anxiety, which makes me not want to eat. So I take zofran for that- which causes constipation. I haven’t had a normal bowel movement in over 6 months.

My doctor has prescribed me Ativan, a bunch of different anxiety and depression meds, they all disagreed with my body. So I stopped taking them. I physically cannot handle the bad “ month” before getting better. I can’t.

I buy Xanax from a friend because they work better for me then anything for my panic attacks. I take a quarter .5 as needed. But that doesn’t help the long term anxiety or depression.

I try to eat, I cook food, take a bite, my stomach will hurt, then I cry because not only am I not eating but now wasting food. I’ve tried shakes, toast, it’s never ending. 5 bites into a normal dinner for example salad- I’m full. 

I could have 3 good days of decent snacking but what’s 3 good days if it’s followed by starving myself for 2? 

I’m so sick of trying to feel ok. I’ve been trying to overcome this eating disorder and all this other bulldhit for a YEAR. NOTHING WORKS.

I’ve even taken supplements that are meant to increase appetite. NOTHING.

But honestly? I’m just done. I’m so fucking done. Guys idk what to do. I don’t wanna hate myself everyday but I do because I can’t even fucking eat a sandwich. 

I have a dumb irrational fear of throwing up so if I feel nauseous it’s game over. I can’t eat out at restaurants ( never been able too gives me panic attacks) I can’t even finish a kids meal.

218,"A little background. I've always believed my dad was a bit ""off""... maybe Asperger's but never diagnosed. He is very intelligent but has almost no common sense and doesn't understand abstract concepts at all. Also not an emotional person, he never hugged us as kids. He and my mom divorced when I was very young, he is now 77 and never remarried.

About 20 years ago he began obsessing about his age and looks. He was always a bit shallow and into how he looked, and wouldn't date any women who wasn't much younger and very pretty. Naturally that gets more difficult to do as one ages. For the past few years, he has become depressed and anxious about aging. All he cares about is how the people around him look and make him feel. It's all about him, and really always has been... but it's more concerning as he's much older now.

He retired last year and has a significant amount of money, and way too much time on his hands. He began supporting a woman in her 20s last year, and she ended up stealing money from him. I was able to cut that off, and get rid of her. He was also making bad financial decisions all around so I was able to convince him to let me manage his finances. Thankfully, he won;'t be able to do any financial harm to himself anymore, but the other issues about his mental health are really difficult to figure out.

I was able to get him to a psychiatrist; he had been on a light anti-depressant for many years, and clearly it wasn't working. I sat in on the session, and was blown away by how my dad charmed the doctor into thinking things aren't all that bad for him. It's like he was on a stage and performing. He would make funny comments to lighten things up, and change the topics with stories that weren't really relevant to the questions she asked him, and by the time you knew it the hour was up. In reality, he lays on the sofa for much of the day, cursing himself for being unhappy, saying everything sucks and he can't stand it anymore, and essentially scaring me and anyone else around him. He has had episodes of screaming (not sure how else to describe it, just a loud SCREAM). Physically he is in excellent shape because has taken such good care of his body - really all he ever cared about was how he looked, so he eats well and exercises to some extent, and it;'s very deceiving because he can fool doctors very easily.

He doesn't live with me, but everytime he visits, he lays on my sofa and goes into chat rooms on his phone. He has several women with whom he talks to overseas, and he chats with them all day long. I am not super concerned about scams because he isn't able to send money to anyone without my approval but the more he talks to these strangers, the more depressed he actually seems afterwards. It;s like he needs to connect to someone all day long. Ironically when I ask him why he spends his day talking to strangers overseas he tells me ""I have no one else to talk to"" . That is bullshit- there is me, and my 3 adult children. All 4 of us make time for him as much as he would like. But he won't engage with us for more than an hour over dinner, and then it's back to his phone and chat rooms.

At one point, I took him to a neurologist to rule out dementia (that was in fact ruled out) and the doctor pulled me aside and said ""things with him will get worse as he gets older"" meaning my dad's emotional state. Yet as a neurologist, he wasn't really qualified to dx anything from a mental health standpoint- he was just giving me a heads up that I am in for some rough years with my dad.

I guess I am not sure what to do... or maybe there is nothing to do. I have suggested everything under the sun to my dad. Volunteering, a companion, making new friends, etc etc etc. I actually arranged for a companion for him thinking he could take walks with this person, she was about 50 years old and in great shape, I thought maybe she could motivate him. Instead he purposely no-showed the first time they were to meet, even though he had told me he was ok with trying it out. He's done this before. Allowed me to set things up, then canceled or just no-showed. There is always some drama in his life - he has had 5 or 6 cycling accidents in the past few years, and I am not saying he falls on purpose, but I do think he likes the process of getting seen by the doctors and getting this kind of attention. He is always saying his stomach hurts or he's very tired ,and literally every day there is some issue like this that he seems to want to believe is an actual health problem.

I have been dealing with this for a while now, and that said, I do have clear boundaries and I don't wear myself out... I have my own life too, and I did learn that I have to disconnect from his issues, so that's not a problem thank goodness. I just hate to see a person like this, so miserable, and yet so unwilling to help themselves with meds or making different choices that could lead to a happier life. He could live another 20 years or so. I am just not sure what -if anything- I can do.",17Jul2020,1

In most cases it happens when I'm in bed ready to go to sleep. Out of nowhere I'll start panicking and sweating really bad. Durring the panic attacks I am very very scared of getting a psychotic episode and losing my grip on reality. I think I understand what is causing this panic, let me explain.


In the second half of my fist year in highschool (age 12) I had a lot of trouble with the stress of highschool and I started smoking weed (not a lot, maybe 3 times in the span of 6 months). I couldnt focus on anything, and my constant stress made me unable to do any basic thing. I barely passed that year. During my summer break my stress didnt go away, and I took it into my nightmarish second year. In the second year the stress of highschool became unbearable and I started skipping school, and smoking more weed. This is where things really went south. When skipping school I'd hang out outside, just aimlessely waiting untill 3 so I could go home and pretend I was comming back from school. In these times where I was out on the street, I was still coping with the stress and I was very unhappy with how my life was spiraling down. I used to have a lot of friends and I was always joking around, but now here I was. Out on the street skipping school, with so much stress that my heart was pounding out of my chest 24/7. This got me into a deep depression and even suicidal toughts. This is where my mental health quickly declined. I started thinking the devil was haunting me and that that must be the reason I felt the way I felt, wich is funny because I am not religious and I dont really believe in a devil. But in this period of time I was convinced this was what was going on. I started communicating with the devil in my head and I genuinely believed it was real. I started smoking a lot if weed to help me calm down and I started getting addicted in a way where I really could not relax without weed. This lasted untill about 3 months into my second year of highschool when my parents found out about me skipping school. I explained abouty stress issues. My dad was furious, but my mom was willing to help me. We made a doctors appointment. The doctor told me I have a burnout and send me to a psychologist. I told my psychologist about my depression and burnout, but I left out my ""devil"" part. The therapy helped and I got permitted to take a break from school for 6 months because of my mental problems. This helped me, for the first time in a year, relax. This is where I slowly started to let go of the devil thing. But still, I didnt understand it probably was a psychosis, I tought it must have just been my depression. After therapy my depression and burnout went away. I re-did that schoolyear succesfully, in a recovering, but happy state. The next year (third year of highschool) I was 15. I was pretty much in perfect mental shape. I was happy and its the happiest I've ever been in my puberty. I kind of forgot about my past troubles and none of it bothered me, I barely tought about them. Fast forward to the fourth year of highschool (age 16) everything was just fune, untill a few months into the year, I started to realise that I probably had a psychotic episode with the whole devil thing. I also was smoking lots of weed in my summer break, I feel like that may be what has caused my overthinking about the past. Fast forward to the start of 2020. The overthinking git me to the point where I am incredably afraid if falling back into psychosis. In februari my panic attacks started. I was laying in bed, and as soon as I tought about the past, I started sweating and panicking. My heart beating out of my chest. And incredabke feeling of fear of going indane surrounded me, and it felt like I was trying to hold on to reality so I stay sane. The panic attacks only feed my fear of getting psychosis because they make me feel like my mental health is declining again, and that may causee to get an episode. 


Fast forward to now, and I have a panic attack almost every single night. I'm scared of being alone, especially in the dark. Anything with a scary vibe (horror movies, scary noises etc.) make me way more scared then before, because I'm afraid I'll get a panic attack. This is impacting my life greatly and I'm not sure what to do. I understand that I should seek out professional help, but I am ashamed and afraid that peaple will think I'm some freak. I still occasionally use weed, but most times I do, I get a feeling of derealisation, where the world around me seems fake. Also this is something new and I used to have a good reaction to weed. This is also why I am quitting weed. I really need help, and I constantly feel like I'm going insane.


In short:

I am extremely afraid if getting a psychotic episode and its giving me panic attacks, that only feed this fear like an endless cycle.

I am very desperate and need help. It honestly means a lot already that youre here. I was wondering if anybody else has had the fear of insanity as much as I have. I'd love any tips, support, or simmilar stories. Have a blesses day!",17Jul2020,1

Well, his Wife Rita Wilson posted a photo of herself seemingly at the beach. I saw this post on Facebook, and so I went to her insta to see if it was a fake post, it wasn't. I wanted to save the photo so I could personally zoom into it, and I ended up saving her profile as a folder onto my computer. I then kept trying to find ways to delete it, I ended up going to a transcript version of it. I managed to finally delete it but now I am petrified that I am wanted dead or something.",17Jul2020,1

Quick bitch moment. 
Year starts off good then, BAM, COVID-19. Next is the stay home order where I and everyone else had school and work online, that’s really hard to do when you work with kids who are hands-on. Partner and I get a puppy and I immediately have bouts of awful sadness and depression. We get engaged on his birthday and then the same day, I’m let go from my 7-year employment at a place I loved, with people I dedicated my life to (I wasn’t let go because of anything I did). I then decided to finish college and pursue career my career and spirituality but of course an extended family member decides to assaults fiancé. Move past it and we’re onto wedding planning but then, the freaking cherry-on-top, my fiancé’s best friend/my good friend suddenly passes. I am in disbelief that this is happening. 
I figured it could really only go up from the assault, but I was obviously very wrong. 
I’m about one second away from losing my shit here and I know I’m not alone. I feel like the Gen-Zers are onto something and I’m in an alternative reality because this cannot be my life now. 
What the actual fuck is going on. 
I didn’t even include all the other shit going on on the world either! 
Someone please wake me up and tell me that I drank myself into a 7 month coma on New Years. 

PS. I am doing fine, as fine as you can do after learning an irreplaceable person in your life has passed. I feel mentally stable and safe and I am grieving the best way I know how. I just needed to let it out and this is as close to “screaming it from the rooftops” as I could get for now.",17Jul2020,1
229,"Alright here's the thing, I don't even know what I feel anymore. I am so disconnected with my own mind that I go from being joyful and full of optimism to sudden swings of existential dread and uncontrollable crying. I was recently forced to start working at my family company and although the work I'm doing right now isn't my bread and butter it's not something I despise doing, but routinely, after a week or so of work, I look back and think ""wow I am miserable as fuck"" and break down in my own mind. Then, a half hour later, I go back to feeling as if this never happened and keep the routine going, which I am sure is no good for my mental health at all. But the kicker is I don't even know what to do. I can't stay home or I'd be a burden to my family and I'd feel unsatisfied with myself, and apparently I can't work or I go into crisis and harm my own mental health. I just feel like I'm in my own stupid cage that I fabricate for the sake of feeling something.

I don't really know, I guess I don't feel like I'm enjoying my 20s as I should and I feel like forcefully working is chipping away at my will to even dedicate myself to anything. I instantly noticed it took the fun away from any prior hobby I have, and I don't feel enthusiastic about any part of my day anymore. I don't even feel like I'm working towards anything. I just kind of realise that I'm just stuck in a loop that leads nowhere and wasting the precious time that I'm told to enjoy every minute of because I can't buy it back. 

I don't even really have the necessity to work. I'm well off financially and can afford to live without bearing a burden to any third party as I have worked since I was 15 or so and I have a few savings, but my parents seem to think that after every year of university the summer has to be spent working because they won't have any leeches in the family that live off other people's shoulder. 
I just want to at least have the summers to myself after dedicating my all to studying and doing the best I can in university, rather than nosediving into working at something I feel no passion for. And to make things worse I'm working alongside my brother who not only excels at his job, he has vacation time and time off, but my parents don't seem to understand that I just want to vacation in my own room without being judged as a fucking parasite of some sort.

I guess my issue isn't as serious as what you guys read on here and every time I think about it I feel like a spoiled brat for even thinking that im right in this so I just needed a place to vent my thoughts out, maybe I'm crazy or something maybe I'm just pathologically lazy.

I mean...ppl don’t care about your thoughts on it (most of them not all) they just want to know what’s going on in your life briefly and that’s not good, that’s toxic and causes mental breakdowns. At first it was hard for me to lose all my pics but I wanted to be free and LIVE. I wanna learn from real life which is rare nowadays, we are conquered with promotions and lies on the internet.

231,"I always thought i have a bit of claustrophobia. A tight, clogged place makes me very uncomfortable. And if that is filled with people, it gets worse. I cant get into a crowded elevator or a bus. Like i always have to have a clear way out of every place or situation. It feels like im gonna choke. Breathing gets very difficult. But i always keep check. Try to stay calm as much as possible.

Apart from the physical places, i sometime feel claustrophobic in my thoughts or in my conscious. Like in this lockdown, im free in my house, have my family with me, even i can go out with mask and gloves. But still it gets me that im in a lockdown. Sometimes nights get quiet scary. I cant sleep, keep tossing and turning. I pray. Keep thinking a bit more, The sun is almost up and it will help me. Also, i have a girlfriend, we have a rocky relationship like any other couple out there, sometimes she gets a bit clingy, talks about marriage and rest of our lives. That gets to me as well. I feel like this is giant web, i cannot get out of this. That makes me wanna not be in a relationship anymore.

Sigh, i don't know if its claustrophobia or it has another name. I feel like being stuck in somewhere i cant get out of. Sometimes i get an anxiety attack, very rarely though. I go to the washroom and try to make myself calm. That works for time being.

Anyway, I've been struggling a lot these past few months with my mental health and even more with the current pandemic going on. Everyday is just the same old routine. I wake up, eat breakfast, do chores, eat dinner, take a shower, brush my teeth, and go to bed. I really don't have much going on outside of my home life. I was working all of 2019 and part of this year until I got laid off from my job. Since then I haven't been very productive in trying to get my life together but I've been wanting for a long time now and each year I feel like I'm going nowhere in life. I'm just too depressed to do anything about it and my anxiety just makes it hard for me to get out in the world and start living my life. I've been dependent on my parents for far too long and I want to start taking steps to move out before I turn 30. I cant see myself living with my family well into my adulthood otherwise I'll just spiral down and maybe take my own life. I honestly feel like I won't amount too much and I'm a pretty stupid person as there's  a lot of things I can't do other then pretty basic and straightforward tasks. I'd like to have a passion in life other than just a dead end job that pays less than a thousand a month. I just don't think I could live off of minimum wage and with the cost of living being so high I don't see how I'll ever afford it but I'm trying best to save up. All of this really stresses me out and I get panic attacks at night wondering how the hell I'm gonna survive out in the real world if I'm not ready. It scares me to think I'll end up homeless and die on the streets. Sometimes I do think I shouldn't be alive at all as I can't contribute anything to society and I'm just a damn failure.

My household is pretty toxic. I have two siblings that are autistic. One is low functioning and is constantly having self aggressive behaviors and attacking people and damaging property  and needs a lot of supervision. It puts a huge burden on not just my parents but myself included as I have to see it almost every week.

I don’t really feel as though I’ve ever received any sort of unconditional stable love from anyone in my life growing up and even now. (I didn’t have the worst childhood but it wasn’t really the best either) And because of that, although sometimes it is cheesy when these artists or creators say i love you or positive affirming things it actually makes me feel better. 

I know I’ve never met them and they have no idea of my existence but it’s the most stable and consistent form of attention or affection I’ve received. I don’t even have to be scared to reciprocate that love either. And not only that but i have no reason to doubt myself since i don’t interact with them so they have no reason to hate me.

(17M) During this whole lockdown thing (UK, Nottingham) I was slowly getting closer to this girl I used to like and got denied by about 9 months ago. I started to develop feelings again but I know for a fact she has no interest back. She’s in my close friends group so I see her all the time and she’s one of my best friends so I don’t want to get rid of the relationship so that I can be happy again because she makes me both happy to be around but feel like shit whenever I realise I like her and she doesn’t like me back. When I say like I mean she’s literally the perfect human and I haven’t seen anything wrong before, it’s more like I’m in love with her more than just like her and it’s just shit.

It’s probably not a mental health issue and just heartbreak or some shit like that so sorry for wasting your time but here’s what I’ve been like because of this whole situation.

Every night after I’ve been on a Group FaceTime or met up with her (5 times a week) I’ve had this constant sadness that I can feel in my heart and body which just makes me feel like shit. I have to take a smile in front of my parents and I have to keep making myself smile and laugh during the day just so I can be happy

I have no motivation at all to do a level work and am extremely far behind and Ik I’m on a path to failure but I don’t know how to tell myself to start doing work.

I feel like I am a failure in every way possible, I hate how I look, my personality, my body and I can’t change any of it which crushes me knowing I can’t change this hatred

It’s affecting my life atm massively and idk what to do about it or where I should ask on reddit or what to even do and I put this on here to ask for any help I could

My little brother is struggling with a lot of different things: right now, he is severely depressed, and he has struggled with self harm, suicidal ideation (not intentions), and disordered eating - apparently he “doesn’t do those things anymore” but it’s hard to know, obviously. 

I have talked to my parents multiple times and I don’t think they are doing enough. He was in therapy pre-covid but not now. I don’t know if therapy helped much. They generally try to help him, but clearly he needs serious intervention. I don’t know if they are taking him seriously enough. 

I’ve been through the same things as him, except nobody intervened, and I want so badly to stop things before they get as bad as they did for me. But my advice doesn’t seem to help much.

The only thing I know to do is just hang out with him and take him places?? But I don’t have the energy + time to do that all of the time.

I just don’t know what to do anymore? I feel like there’s nothing else to try.",17Jul2020,1
258,"This is just coming from my experience, but I thought I would share both to warn and get feedback.

I’m 39 and have been diagnosed as schizoaffective since 22-23.  I haven’t had a drink in years and I don’t do pot although legal in my state.  I know not to do either as they have negative interactions with my medication and they both are triggers aggravating my condition.

I do smoke cigarettes though.  In particular, I smoke rolling tobacco called Golden Harvest, in tubes by the same Golden Harvest brand, made by a Top-O-Matic Machine.  This post is intended for those of us with mental health issues that already smoke to discuss whether they have had bad experiences with Vaping.  It’s not meant to encourage those who don’t smoke to smoke.  

I tried vaping three days ago because I thought it would be a healthier smoke.  I went to my local tobacco shop and the man provided me with a fifty dollar starter kit and he threw in the vape juice.  I picked a delivery system that was cost effective but reliable.  If people want more details just ask.

When I first took a puff, the vape hit me like sweet relief, it was a rush.  So, I felt really good about my purchase.  Unfortunately as I puffed throughout the day I didn’t realize I became manic.  From experience I know if I go manic I have an episode.  Sure enough by nightfall I was having an episode of paranoia.  At 39 I have enough experience with this illness to take a cold shower, medication, sleep to let the episode pass.  I highly recommend Luke cold showers moments of discomfort like the paranoia and anxiety that were hitting me.

It’s been two days now and I’m feeling much better.  The episode has passed and all I have is a little depression.  I’m pretty certain it was the vaping that caused it.  That’s the only thing I did different recently.  So, now I’ll just stick to rolling tobacco and the occasional box of L&amp;M cigarettes.

Has anyone had similar experiences?  Does any know if this has been researched?

Again, this is only personal testimonial.  I understand some people are fine with vaping.  I just know it doesn’t work for me and aggravates my condition.",17Jul2020,1
259,"None of my friends want to get old but this friend might not even make till next year. Since he moved into a new town we used to chat daily and met 1-2 times a month. In April this year he suddenly stopped responsing and due to Corona I haven't tried to meet him.
At first I wasn't worried because when I first met him it was a habit of him to not response but after a few weeks I found out that he's doing very bad. Last week he responded to some of my messages (I still him message multiple times a week) and it looked like it would become better. Unfortunately that's not the case. 


Today we decided to go to a concert together in october. It's one of his favorite artist so I think unless he doesn't over dose he will live until october for sure and I think that he thinks that he will get better until then. That's the only good thing currently.
He does a lot of drugs, drinks to much, is harming himself and is not leaving his bed. He don't want to meet me and our mutual friend because somehow he thinks he doesn't deserve to.


How can I help him? I'm currently think the best idea would be to just visit him without his consent and staying there until he either talk about his problems with me or goes to a psychiatrist. In pretty sure he won't react very to this and won't even open the door. 
I don't know what to do. He needs help. Preferable professional help but he doesn't want any help.",17Jul2020,1
260,"My first and only true friend just broke things off with me after I fucked things up.

I feel like I've caused nothing but pain and suffering for my loved ones. 

I feel like their lives would be better if I didn't exist",17Jul2020,1
261,"So straight up I never checked for anything or got a dignasois but I know for a fact I'm rife with mental health issues.

I definitely have anxiety ,I lived with it all my life I can feel it ...I just know,and I am also like the biggest daydreamer there is !!I have maladaptive dreaming to the nth degree,im talking everything I do,I'm gonna shut down for moments and day dream then continue then day dream again and the cycle continues.

I wonder if these effect my studies cause I feel like they do but I also would like to know if I'm also just slow or ...plain stupid .

Im in college,I do excellent ,but I take unfathomable amount of time to study,I also can't do books,it's literally a goal of mine to just do 1 book ...1 ...I always give up cause I take like an hour on 5 pages !!

The academic book that I'm going through right now,people comment that it's the most concise least complex academic book on the subject yet here I am reading a page like 10 times struggling for knowledge,and I'm in the introductory chapter mind you xD.

I do better at visual learning ,I'll watch lectures and other learning videos on YouTube and get along fine for the most part but books kill me ,it's like I just derp and I feel like I have 5 iq whenever I see scientific notations or writings.

I also would like to mention that I feel slow af irl,I gave up on going outside and hanging out with people cause there's gonna be everyday situations where I'm gonna get made fun of for how I act,I always feared real life cause at least in my own space I get to be a failure in my own eyes,but out in the real world it's there for everyone to see.

I wonder if me feeling extremely useless outside has to do with either my severe social anxiety or lack of intelligence or both.

I don't understand people that can take like 6 subjects and some that have jobs and still study,and I'm out here barely able to keep up with 2 subjects.",17Jul2020,1
