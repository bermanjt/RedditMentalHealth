0,"TW - suicide 

Hi Reddit fam, I'm (26F) currently writing this feeling very defeated and desperate for answers. Not really sure what I'm looking for - maybe writing it down is cathartic in a way. Apologies in advance for the novel. 

In January/February, my mom (53 years old, physically healthy, no history of mental health issues) started complaining about unexplained/constant dizziness. While annoying, she could pretty much completely function. To ensure nothing was wrong, she went to an ENT, gyno (she recently went through menopause, last period was about a year ago), neurologist, had a brain MRI, blood tests, you name it - everything came back completely fine. It's worth adding that during this month, there was a really stressful family situation that eventually resolved itself and everything was fine. 

Then COVID hits. We're based in NY/NJ so mid-March we had to begin quarantining. Over the course of March, my mom's dizziness worsened to the point where it was the only thing she could talk about; just constant rumination and it basically rendered her unable to do normal activities like read, watch TV, go on the computer, etc. Because anything physical was ruled out, the HCPs my mom saw all recommended she speak with a psychiatrist. The operating theory was that my mom had some kind of underlying anxiety that was causing the dizziness. The psychiatrist started my mom on buspirone (but my mom complained about it making her dizziness worse) and then switched her to 10 mg of Lexapro. My mom has always had sleeping issues so she was given Trazadone to help with this. Quick note that my mom had also been taking small amounts of Ambien and Xanax for the past year or two to address this ongoing sleep problem. She stayed on low doses of these while also on Trazadone and Lexapro. 

Fast forward from end of March to the end of April and her situation only gets worse. The only way I can describe it is watching the complete deterioration of a person. It was awful. My mom went from the most strong, loving person to bascially a shell of a human. All she could do was ruminate about her health, repeating the same sentences and asking the same questions constatly. She would hysterically cry for no reason and be in a complete state of agitation just unable to function or do anything, including sleep. Because we were (are...) in the middle of a pandemic, our options for help at this time were severely limited. It was clear that this was too complicated of a case for our local psychiatrist (and many doctors weren't accepting new patients) so we made the difficult decision to send her to a private mental health hospital/institution in CT for a few weeks with the hope they would be able to help her to some extent.

While at the facility in CT, a doctor spoke with her for 45 min and basically assigned her a diagnosis of axienty and depression. They eventally told my Dad there were also elements of severe psychosis. She went on 5 mg Haldol and they swtiched her from Xanax to a small bit of Ativan at night. Also adding that she is a super private (even shy) person so I'm not sure she really got the full benefits of the program - group therapy was tough for her to open up in and I don't think she could really focus properly in this setting. To add to things, someone very sadly committed suicide in the room next to hers her second week there. The next day someone was also diagnosed with COVID-19 in the program. 

When she came home in the beginning of June, we did notice she was relatively better and able to do things she hadn't done since March (like driving, going to the groceries, etc.); however, she was complaining about feeling physcially and mentally slow and we saw it too - she was emotionally flat and definitely was walking/moving slow. The doctors in CT wanted her to stay on the 5 mg of Haldol through the end of the month, but due to her perceived slowness, my mom was persistent in wanting to go off the medication to see if this improved her symptoms. With the doctors' approval, she slowly reduced the Haldol and by end of June she was completely off the medication. About a few days after coming off, my mom bascially relapses and goes back to the same behavior we saw before she left for CT in April - constant rumination/repeating the same things over and over again, emotionally dull, very agitated - even suicidal ideations. 

We recently switched to a new psychiatrist who now has my mom on 40 mg of Latuda and 50 mg of Zoloft (she's been on it for about a week). I do know it takes a few weeks to see any benefits (if it works), but basically her condition has yet to improve.  

As I'm sure so many people can relate in a way, I can't even overstate how devastating this has been for us as a family. We're all super close and to hear my mom say she's in so much pain has just been gutwrenching - especially when there's nothing we can do to take that pain away. 

The worst part is we don't fully understand what's wrong. How did my 53-year-old mom go from a vibrant, happy person to where she is now? Especially when this whole thing seemed of come out of nowhere. It's been four months and we're just exhausted, angry, and sad. I just want my mom back and I'm so afraid for the future (not only for my mom, but my whole family - it's just been so hard to cope with and accept). 

If you made it to the end of this, bless you &lt;3 Would love to know if anyone has had a similar experience themselves or with a family member.",09Jul2020,1
3,"Hello, I was directed to this sub after I posted on r/nostupidquestions 
I'm pretty new to reddit and on mobile so sorry for any mistakes.
  
Heads up, this is long.
  
I (29F) am part of a big family. I have seven siblings and a lot of cousins. We are all quite close, well closer than a lot of other families I know anyway, and at the heart of it all are my grandparents. They are the most selfless, loving, amazing people in the world and have spent 59 years creating their own little legacy of love that is our family. 
  
Towards the end of May, we noticed my nan was getting more confused than usual. Mixing up her words and names etc. Originally we just put it down to age, but one day my sister went round and my nan couldn't even string a coherent sentence together. 
  
This was obviously very concerning so we called her an ambulance and she was taken in for tests. Our worst case scenario was a bleed on the brain (something she had suffered with previously) but we were all hopeful it would come back as nothing too serious. 
  
My nan was in hospital for about 5 days. Due to covid, we couldn't visit. Not even my grandad was allowed in which was heartbreaking for him as they are rarely apart. We called her, made her a scrapbook filled with family photos so we would be there with her in spirit. 
  
Eventually the tests came back. Stage 4 brain cancer. We were stunned. After another few days of agonising limbo whilst 18 specialists looked at her case, we were told there was nothing they could do. 
  
From then, things moved extremely fast. Within a week she had lost her speech, then the right half of her body lost movement, her memory became worse while her confusion grew. We made sure she was never alone, we visited as much as we could whilst adhering to social distancing but at a certain point to be honest, we all basically said stuff it and gave our nan a big hug. 
  
It was 30 days from start to finish. On July 1st, my beautiful nan became heavens newest angel. She passed away in the arms of her adoring husband, surrounded by her daughters and photographs of her grandchildren and great grandchildren. 
  
Since then, I've been a mess. I've cried every single day, mostly at night and mostly when no one can see me. We've been doing all we can to help my grandad and their daughters (including my mother). My nan was loved by so many people and she was taken from us so quickly, it just wasnt fair. we weren't ready. I know no ones every ready but it just happened so fast. 
  
I feel like I cant be honest with my family about how much I'm struggling because I dont want to cause extra stress for them and I also admire how strong they all are, I dont want to be the weak one. But guys, I'm seriously broken. 
  
I know this was a long post if you read it all thank you. 
Please hug your loved ones tightly. Take photos, tell them you love them. Never waste a second. 
My nan used every ounce of strength she could to tell us she loved us until she fell asleep the day before she died and never woke up again. 
She had so much strength. I wish she was here.",09Jul2020,1
4,"This could be tagged as venting also. I don't know what to say, really. I'm 17 years old - so close to moving out and I guess ""starting"" my life - but I just feel like everything is falling apart. My relationship with my parents has never been great. I've dealt with the guilt tripping and berating and trash-talking my whole life and fully intend to cut them off once I move out and have intended to since I understood what that meant. Since lockdown has started, it's only gotten worse, and I feel so ridiculously miserable. I never want to be home, and my parents don't want me home either, but I have to be. I don't know why I've started feeling so miserable. My life had gotten really good at the beginning of lockdown, if only briefly - I had great relationships with my friends and had just gotten a boyfriend (whom I am still with and love very much) - but now I just feel so fatigued and hopeless. It feels as if it's not even worth trying to get out of bed most days. I don't know what I want to do after high school. I'm not particularly good at anything and my grades are average at best. I don't know what college I want to go to and I don't even know if it matters anymore since the world seems to be falling to pieces (at least in America). It's tiring having to deal with my parents and my friends. It's tiring having to think about my own future and about everything going wrong around me. I don't feel a motivation to keep living like I used to. I really just don't care. There isn't anybody that I'd like to live for, least of all myself. I just feel completely lost and alone, constantly, and maybe I deserve that.",09Jul2020,1
5,Does your family do this to you too? I still live with my parents so they gossip about me in any way to my siblings and other people. Sometimes it’s not true or just dramatic. It hurts. Just wondering if everyone’s family does this or if it’s okay?,09Jul2020,1
6,"I have now for 2 years been getting help for my social anxiety. I used to be out of the house ALL the time, partying, playing football doing whatever with my friends. But all of a sudden i just stopped, broke off all contact with my friends. I have now not been for real outside of the house, other than school. I have now for 6 months, been thinking about suicide, everyday. It's worst when i'm not doing anything, which leads me to the next problem. I have gained A TON of weight, which doesn't really help me go outside, or feel good about myself. I have been cutting or hitting myself, and trying to starve myself a couple times now. I really wanna tell my parents or someone, who would take me serious. But i just don't know how to say it, cause i have never talked with my parents about my feelings, how did you or someone you know, tell you were having suicidal thoughts?",09Jul2020,1
7,"For context, I'm 20, male, I have anxiety and at one point when I was 16 I was clinically depressed, I've had anxiety since the age of 13. 

I think the best way to describe how I am feeling is to use a specific example, as it's fresh in my mind and it's easier for me to explain.

More context, I care deeply for animals and have 4 cats, they are all Indoor cats and are not allowed outside. 

This high anxiety thing only happens at night when I'm in bed, all the cats sleep downstairs. Nearly every night and panic and think that one of the following has happened.
Either one of the doors is open, or, on of them is hurt. I have to then go downstairs and walk around looking for all of them, I won't stop until I find all 4. I then check of all the doors are locked by pressing down on the handle. I press down on it multiple times over and over. I will walk out of the room only to walk back in to check if again. I will usually check a door around 5/6 times before I stop. And even when I go back upstairs I still want to go back down and check everything again. It is a crippling feeling when I think something bad has happened. 

This constant checking has surrounded my everyday life. I once left the fridge open and since then I will now push the fridge door shut 5 times similar to the door. I even check my messages in case I have sent it to the wrong person every time. 

This feeling is present all the time and it is so frustrating, going back to the cat example I even start to hear things that aren't actually there, like a cat meow. Which will make me also want to start checking everything. When I hear something I mute everything such as the TV and sit in silence for a couple of minutes in case I hear the noise again.

Another example is when I'm in my university flat, I worry that someone is in the flat and has broken in and I panic when I hear a noise . I then stare underneath the fire frame (as there is a light on the other side) and see if there is a shadow of a pair of feet outside the door.",09Jul2020,1
8,"Hello there, i guess i'm just here because i just need to vent here but also want to know if anybody has any suggestions on how to cope with things or how they cope with similar things in a healthy way.

Anywho, lately i've been having a sense of dread like something or someone is out to get me and that something is going to happen soon. I feel like its a person or entity, not much of an event like a natural disaster although that is always a concern. I suppose the big reason why i'm writing this is because I felt ill suddenly one night; dizziness and difficulty balancing, nausea, difficulty concentrating, fatigue, that sort of thing. I looked into my water cup to find it a milky white and this send me swiftly moving to the kitchen sink to rinse it out. I noticed a white residue in the bottom, one that I swiftly washed away. Ever since then I've been afraid that what i'm consuming is somehow contaminated, mostly water I drink. Today was especially hard because even though it didn't look any different I felt like my water was somehow wrong and not the same. I couldn't pinpoint what I derived this from but I felt it in my core like it was a survival instinct. I felt like I couldn't tell my parents, however and I didn't know why but, yet again, I just felt it intensely in my being. I haven't drank water all day and i'm now afraid to take my medication in fear that it is also contaminated with something. All I can think of in my head is a white mucus or film and pale white hands brushing against me, whispering to me in languages unknown to any mortal being but in a way that I know i understand deep down somewhere. I don't know, i'm just confused right now. Physically I feel fine but mentally I feel like i'm being watched and assessed and that if i fall asleep I won't wake up.  I feel like I can't tell if noises are laughter or crying and it scares the heck out of me and I want to understand whatever is there reaching for me with its dozens of clammy hands and mouths. I don't know, I just need to get this out there. I have a past with psychotic symptoms and anxiety and depression and such things have lead me to the hospital twice and I don't want to go back because i just can't relive things i've seen and heard there without having another dance with trauma. Thank you for listening and have a good day/night.",09Jul2020,1

10,"I don’t know how to start this, so I’ll just jump in. I’m a teenage female, and I have no interest in having friends. Sometimes I make friends &amp; think that the new friendship will work this time, but it always gets old quickly and I realize that I’d rather be alone. I feel bad because I don’t want to hurt them. I always want to be alone, except when I spend time with a select few people. 
I’ve never been in a real relationship. I’m young, and it’s understandable, but I’m just not interested. Everyone seems to be having crushes and dating, and I thought I’d want that too but I really don’t. 
I can’t share personal things with others except my parents. People at school don’t ask about stuff, so I don’t tell. I think this is probably super unhealthy, but I don’t want to share. It’s very embarrassing for me. My house was broken into and my mom was in a car accident. Both events happened this year, and I haven’t told anyone.

13,"We (our eldest daughter, my hubby, and myself) went to the DMV today to get my ID done and to clear up some stuff with my hubby's suspended license and to see if our daughter could get her 21 year old license yet. Well, the line was all the way around the corner of the building, and at first the clouds were pretty thick and it was drizzling just a little, so it was humid as hell but not direct-sunlight hot. Well, that changed rapidly. The clouds broke after a little while and the sun came out full-force. So now it was about 93F and a humidity of about 80%. Yeah. It felt like freaking Florida (no offense to my Floridian friends here!!). I was sweating my ever-loving ass off. We had to endure that for almost 3 hours. FINALLY, the line moved and moved and we were next. I sat on the steps in the shade and breathed a sigh of relief. It was still humid as fuck, but at least I was out of the sun. I do not do well in humidity and sun. I am a white WHITE girl, as in white as flour lol. I am very fair-skinned and burn easily, and I have health problems (breathing) that make it difficult to breathe when it is that sticky out. I survived just fine though, and I wore my mask inside the DMV even though I felt like I was going to suffocate. I got a drink from the fountain and nearly drowned myself lol. The water came up fast and high, and I wasn't prepared for that ahahahahah. It was actually pretty funny. :) The lady standing at the door, letting 2 people in at a time even chuckled, but that was ok because I was laughing too. I had our daughter run back home (we were only 5 minutes from home actually) to get my birth certificate, social security card, and 2 proofs of residency so I could do my ID. I didn't need the first 2 things because they just gave me a regular ID and not the Real ID. Good. I got my camera card and waited for my turn to get my photo snapped.   


Let me just pause here and say that my mugshot from when I had been arrested was BETTER than that picture...and that is a sad, sad thing lololol.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, well. I barely use my ID, but it was outdated and needed to be renewed. I look like a serial killer, or a crazed pyromaniac who wants to burn...never mind. Heh.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, hubby got his stuff settled (he has a year suspension that goes until April 2021 and then 3 more months possibly until July 2021...UGH UGH UGH!!!!!!) but he has to call and see what they are doing with that since he has paid all the court fines already. :) Eldest daughter also found out about her license, and we were done. Thank goodness. We left, hungry and tired from waiting so long. We also had to wait about an hour inside the DMV for our numbers to be called, so that was almost 4 hours total. At least it was cool in there and there were chairs!! 

&amp;#x200B;

After that, the three of us went to Panera Bread where I got a salad and hubby and daughter had sandwiches. It was relaxing and a lot of fun. I REALLY enjoyed myself. Just the conversation and the food...so wonderful. We then went to the pet store for more treats and stuff for daughter's cockatiel, Kokobella, and I got myself another parakeet. This was supposed to be #3.

&amp;#x200B;

I said supposed to be because as I was trying to get him into the cage with the other 2 keets, he had squeezed through a small opening in the top of the window (they don't shut all the way) and got outside. He is still out there, as far as I know...I hope. We won't get him back down, so he is lost forever. I think my daughter said the other wild birds might have killed him already because she saw a bird-figure lying in the branches not moving. :(   


So now I have to get another bird. I am not upset though, as I thought I would be. I am having trouble feeling anything at the moment. It isn't because I am terribly depressed (I am not overly depressed at all) but because I am so worn out from the sun and humidity that I feel sluggish and just worn down. I have a slight sunburn...and a cool shower had felt SO wonderful after being in the sun for almost 3 hours, then spending another hour out there when we were trying to get the bird out of the low bushes. No luck. It was just too muggy for me to stay out there. We met our new neighbor, though. He is a very nice guy and he even had tried to help us! That was sweet. I owe him a big thank you. 

&amp;#x200B;

So that is my tale, my friends. I am heading off in a cab now to go to the local Turkey Hill (local mart) for ice tea and snacks. I will be back later. :D

20,"I attempted suicide yesterday via overdose.

My ex-partner found me and rushed me to hospital to get treatment when I couldn't vomit the pills back up. I have never seen him so fucking scared. I was suicidal and I was more calm than he was. He kept missing the signs in the hospital pointing to the emergency reception, and I had to guide him because he was so terrified.

I am now ok. Well, as ok as I can be.

I am no longer actively suicidal and I have taken the steps I was given as part of my crisis plan (the plan the doctors give you after a suicide attempt to make sure you start getting treatment). I am now waiting on a phone call from two people: the social workers and the counselling organisation. I am optimistic about the counselling because I think it will give me the tools to prevent something like this in the future.

But I'm so scared for my ex. He isn't the type to talk about his feelings, and I'm scared he won't tell his family about this event. I know he blames himself for my suicide attempt (something he said/did prompted me to try it) and I don't want him to live with that baggage. My suicide attempt was MY doing - not his. But I know he doesn't see it that way. I want to make sure he gets the care he needs too.

I have apologised repeatedly, and I aim to improve so this never happens again, but it's not enough. He needs care too. He suffered a traumatic event.

How can I encourage him to get the help HE needs while I get the help I need?

I have no trauma, atleast nothing distinct. I was never abused, nor did I grow up in a split home. The feelings I feel, the thoughts I have, the trauma I experience are all self-inflicted.

It's difficult to know where to start but I know that I am consumed by anxiety so badly that I am never calm, never relaxed, everything is a heart attack and MUST get done now. It drives me.

-The main one is that I'm paranoid as hell. I strongly believe that some people can read my inner monologue and thoughts. For example, everytime I'm thinking about something I shouldn't, I change the words or use a special code so that they don't understand. And I feel like they know everything about me, like if they were constantly reading my mind.

-Apart from me being paranoid, I'm lacking empathy and sympathy. 

-I have really weird mood swings and I can get angry in a matter or seconds.

-My speech is getting worse, even though I'm good at writting, people often don't understand what I'm saying because a)I stop talking halfway through the sentence b)I can't pronounce words correctly.

30,"hello everyone! this is gonna be kind of long so bear w me. this all started around 2 months ago when i began slipping into a depressive episode type of thing and lost a lot of my appetite. due to this, over the past two months i’ve lost around 8 lbs just because i havent been eating a normal amount. then, sometimes i would get hungry and eat and i would feel really guilty for eating because i would then feel like i was faking being depressed and if i was really depressed i would have no appetite at all (stupid, i know). somewhere in there, i started weighing myself, because i was curious how much weight i was losing.

it started off as a little perk. like oh hey im losing weight thats cool. then, it would be if the number on the scale went up i would feel really bad. or, if i ate what i considered to be too much i would feel really guilty, not just because it made me feel like i was faking my depression but because i felt gross and fat and like i was gonna gain weight. i started counting my calories in my head, and then just started using an app to track them. not eating makes me feel powerful. it makes me feel like it’s something i can control, in a time where my mind is not a safe place for me i feel like i have something to hold onto and control. i have never felt worse about my body. i keep looking at myself in the mirror and thinking what i could accomplish actually trying if i lost 8 lbs basically on accident.

i’m scared of the way im thinking but i also feel like im making it up. but ive also tried to just say fuck it and eat and then i feel so guilty and shitty about myself. i’ve been spending a lot of time on this subreddit which doesnt help. i just feel so terrible, like i want to have an ed or something. but i dont. i just want to be skinnier and this is giving my brain something to think about besides killing myself or how pointless life is. i feel in control. today i ate 300 cals of grilled chicken as my one meal (bedsides coffees) and i felt so gross that i purged. im probably just overreacting but i dont know. sorry if this post is annoying or triggering or anything, just comment and ill take it down. am i overreacting and how do i stop these thoughts??

36,"I'm a teen F, and the three friends in question are also female teens. I moved thousands of miles away from where we used to live a year ago, but I'm still in contact with them. I've known them for a long time and really care about all of them, but a conversation today has left me at a loss for words. 

I've known those three for the past three years and they're my closest friends. We used to spend every moment together when we were at school and even now that I've moved away, I still keep in touch with them and love them like sisters. Let's call them Amy, Sarah, and Jess. Amy has always been a levelheaded person. She kept me in check when I became irrational and is such a talented person. She's always been good at doing her work without complaint, and is generally someone to keep me logical. Sarah is an adorable sweetheart. She's bubbly and bouncy, and emotionally mature beyond her years. She was there for me through my rough patch, all of them were. And Jess. She has the voice of an angel, and of the three, I worried about her the most. She sometimes seemed not okay, and that worried me, but she was extremely close to Sarah and I knew they were supporting each other. She didn't talk to me about it and I didn't want to push her to do so. I never suspected that any of them were unhappy, except maybe Jess. She had moments where I really worried about her, and I tried to talk to her about it but she would say one vulnerable sentence, and then deflect. Rinse and repeat. 

Flash forward to today, I'm texting Jess and she sounds not good. So I'm trying to figure out if she's okay or not, and she keeps deflecting the conversation to me and worrying about me. Asks if I've ever felt like harming myself. I've had rough patches, but I've never really felt that way and I told her that. But she's still worried about me. Eventually, I'm able to ask about her, and she tells me that she's been cutting herself. Since the time we met. And she's not okay. I was surprised but at the same time, I guess I knew in the back of my head that she wasn't in tip-top shape mentally.  What I didn't know tho, was how bad it is. She's really hurting, and it breaks my heart. She then goes on to tell me that it wasn't just her. Both Sarah and Amy were cutting themselves too. When we were in class, sometimes they'd go to the restroom and stay for a lil while. Apparently that was because one of them would mentally break down. They never told me because ""you were the only one who was normal, and you kept us sane."" I genuinely had not even an inkling that any of them were mentally struggling, and today I found out that all three of them were equally really struggling and being self-destructive. 

Amy and Sarah still haven't talked to me and have no idea that I know. It breaks my heart that my three best friends are struggling, and that they couldn't tell me. I want to help them and be there for them anyway I can, but two of them haven't even approached the topic and the third is very shaky about mentioning it with me. She apologized a million times a minute. I've never had mental health struggles and don't know what to do with this knowledge. I'd appreciate any advice at all about what to do or how to be there for my friends. Help?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr- I just found out that my three best friends are all struggling mentally and are harming themselves. I didn't know this for 3 years because they didn't want to tell me, because ""I kept them sane by being the normal one."" Two of them have no idea I know, and the friend who told me is still very shaky about talking to me. I guess she feels like she's burdening me or tarnishing me in some way. I've never had major struggles with mental health, so I have no idea what to do. I want to help them or be there for them any way that I can. Could you give me any advice?",09Jul2020,1

39,"Hey all, 
With COVID here I'm with my wife a lot and we have been fighting more, it's been several times now and I am realizing I'm really reactive and defensive.

I have a lot of abuse under my belt from my father and the only way I ever was able to maintain my sense of power and self was to doggedly argue and fight him. I was constantly berated, told I would be nothing, physically abused and molested. When I come under fire or perceive a threat to my esteem I react poorly. I have been better in the past but I think I'm not on top of my mental game lately.

I've been able to work through a lot of this but I feel now that I engage my wife when we argue or when I perceive her as being unfair to me like a freaking bear trap.

It doesn't even have to be something that matters, twice I have perceived her as having bad intentions or being unfair to me in the last week and instigated a fight with her.

Literally today I started a fight about her asking me to take a Zoom call on headphones, I decided she was being inconsiderate to ask me to do that because she takes her calls in central space and off of headphones (I'm usually asleep I work nights).

I feel like I can't even control it. I go full right brain.

TLDR: I react poorly to perceived antagonism or real antagonism and sometimes I even make my own.

I've tried getting out more and initiating conversations with people, but I always feel like no one likes me. I've had several friends in the past, but they all seem to leave.

44,"Today was a bad day. I’ve posted in here a lot, it’s become my new obsession. I’m 10 days into 40mg of fluoxetine and I’m not feeling any better. I know it takes time for it to kick in, but it was this time last year i was put on 30mg. I’m in the same spot i was a year ago. I started seeing my current psychiatrist back in September, but I’m still here. It’ll be four years in September my anxiety started for the very first time moving in to college, and I’m still here. I’ve exercised, read books, taken medicine, I’m still here. I told my mom I may look for a new psychiatrist if I don’t start to see results soon, and she kinda started with me. She asked what more can someone do it has to be within yourself to get it done. My mom doesn’t get it and my dad has a brief history with some mental illness, but not to the degree I have it. My mom just said that it doesn’t seem like the therapy is doing much, 40mg is the most medicine I’ve been on and things seem to be getting worse. It made me upset to hear this because I knew it was true. From September to February, things were great. But I’ve lost the consistency of feeling good for months now. It’s not pandemic related or event driven. My anxiety is about my anxiety. I’m in a fear cycle. I feel as though I’m out of answers, and only i can see that. I posted this tonight because as I was walking up the stairs I got this flash that said “this is it, this is what your life is and always will be.” I shut my bedroom door and started crying. I know people have it worse, but I can’t believe what has transpired in 4 years. The rest of my life is fine. I’ve probably lived a spoiled life to this point. I have a job, I’m going for my cpa, I’m 24, etc. But there’s no way this is normal. There’s no way everyday should be a fight to see if your feeling okay. I don’t know what to do and where to go. I know accepting anxiety is the way to beat it but I can’t seem to practice it. I’m losing hope and I’m really scared. I don’t know what I did to deserve this.",09Jul2020,1

I told her that her friends are more important with their feelings instead of mine. Her response is “they come to me and you don’t”. She’s right I should go to her but she stated early today that she enjoys being on her phone and it’s one of the little things that make her happy and I am not the person that wants to take joy away from others.

Maybe I've somehow avoided talking about what's really going on in my life for the past 2 years in therapy, it's too much to talk about so I disassociate, but I feel like I can't be helped. It could be the combination of what I have, or I'm expecting too much, maybe I need a specialist; I feel I have to accept that I can't feel real and happy.

I don't want to say I've lost hope, I'd like to think I'm better than 2 years ago, but in reality I'm not. The best option for me is to probably start medication again. There are just certain people born to die, born into chaos, and medication is the only thing that's helped me.

I take medication to soften the anxiety but I have noticed more and more over the years that I experience short episodes that closely fit the symptoms of mania.. agitated/jittery, unrealistically good mood, laughing myself sore, racing thoughts, jumping from one topic to another extremely fast and sometimes making no sense in my sentences. 

Though these 'episodes' at the most severe only last upwards of 20 minutes and I can have a more acute episode for a few hours. Though typically mania is something that goes on for a long while. I don't get a grandiose sense of self and i'm completely aware when i'm doing it but can't control it.

54,"Every time I start dating someone and I become emotionally invested and attached, I get very anxious and panic. Thoughts of infidelity and not being good enough flood my mind. If he’s taking a while to respond to me, I’ll panic and think he’s talking to some other girl or he doesn’t want to talk to me. In the beginning it’s usually manageable and I can talk it out with my partner but it gets worse and worse as time moves on. I don’t know why these thoughts fester my mind. They haven’t done anything, that I know of, that has given me a reason to doubt them. There’s this part of me that wants to be the best of the best in their eyes: better than all their exes and previous partners. This includes personality, physical attractiveness, career, etc. The physical attractiveness is usually the one I’m most concerned about. I have some assumptions as to why I feel this way. I am riddled with negative thoughts about my appearance. I don’t like how I look and don’t really consider my self an attractive person. That’s (my face) not something I can change about myself. There’s this constant thought of not being enough for them and because of that maybe they’ll stray because I’m not enough for them to stay. Maybe if I’m the best, they’ll actually try to keep me… I know no one’s perfect and it’s not exactly possible to be the best at everything… but I can’t seem to get those thoughts out of my mind. Usually at the 2-3 month mark, it gets so bad to the point where I panic because I don’t think they’re interested in me as much anymore or I’ll nitpick at the things they say about me and make it out to be an attack on my appearance or just me in general. I’ll end this out of nowhere and without hesitation because I just want to stop feeling that way…. and maybe they’ll step forward and show me that they actually want me. This time around, I notice that my hand tremors have gotten more noticeable. I should’ve caught on that I’m more anxious than normal instead of dismissing it. When they don’t step up and “let things end”, I feel personally attacked and go into a spiral. I make myself the victim of the narrative because them just agreeing to me being “too sensitive for the relationship” or any other lame excuse I give, means that they personally think that way and that I’m too much for them to handle… I’m unwanted again…

60,"Hi, this is my first post here, and I'm pretty sure it's a long one. 

I'm 23 years old, I only have an older brother, who is a NEET, so all the respobilities is all on me. I'm the only one who is working, my dad is with another family. He sometimes visits us. My mom is living with my Grandmother and my Uncle. So basically, me and my brother are the only ones here in the house (w/c we only rent)

Here in our house, we have a barber shop and a small store. But ever since the pandemic, it got tough. Not a lot of customers coming to our shop/store. I always think how to pay the bills (rent, water, electricity, internet). Please keep in mind that my salary from working in a company is completely inadequate for the rent alone. 

I always lock myself in my own room, since I don't want to interact with my brother, since he's the type of guy who brags all the time without having any achievements (e.g. studied until high school only, no work, etc.)

I work as an assistant in a financing corporation.  I always do my best effort in interacting with clients, with coworkers. However, I always get scolded from other groups, telling me that I'm not doing my job right. There was one time that I literally cried for an hour in the restroom cubicle, because one of my coworker says that I always make the same mistakes. She always scolds me, only noticing the mistakes I made. She never notices the good things I did. 

In work, I never got the chance to know if I did a job well done, I always hear from my work that I always make mistakes. 

This week, I didn't get to report to my work. I have this feeling that I don't want to work, because I will interact with some coworkers, only getting bad vibes from them. At the same time, feeling sad because I can't get to help my other coworkers, making them to work double as to cover my absence. 

It also came to me if I should look for a new job, because the work I have now is pretty much not doing the best for me, especially my self esteem. Also, thinking if I quit, how can I pay the bills here in our house. I did thought of what if, I try to end my life. Thinking of it, I also think of the people who will be left, so it stops me from commiting it. 

Being alone here in my room makes me think a lot of things, I also cried while typing this post. Not sure if I need help, or am I just thinking things. 

I actually asked my friend if he thinks I have a mental illness or not, he told me that I'm just overthinking it and cheers me up that I can overcome this.

65,Is it actually helpful? Is it worth it if you have along list of problems? I’m low income (single mom) but I’m spiraling and I need help. I don’t know what to do given the “based on income” therapist around me are booked out for months. I’ve been in a deep depressive state for a long time and I’m finally looking for help only to be met with 150 a session or 80 a week for online. Neither of which I can afford. Both are making me feel like I’m a lost cause. What are people supposed to do... why isn’t mental health more serious.,09Jul2020,1
66,"Being in a codependent, abusive relationship when you have depression and drug addiction and she possibly has bipolar, porphyria, cluster type B personality disorder and sociopathy. -

You meet someone who is already engaged as of 3 days before. You already k know you are attracted to her and as soon as you start texting you know you like her a lot, but with your depression and the shit show that has been your life up until then, you know there is no way she is attacted to you or would like you at all. You guys hang out in person one night, and she just talked for hours and was so open and friendly and excited and told me about so much and it felt great. She said that she doesn’t really sleep well alone, so I told her super platonicly that I would sleep in the chair if it would help, she said “I wouldn’t let you sleep in the chair”. After that comment I didn’t know which way she meant. But then we hung out another night, and after the second night she says she just had a panic attack the night before. Eventually she tells you she wants to break off the engagement in a subtle way by switching from separate chairs to jumping on top of me and starting to kiss me, in her apartment with all the lights off. I feel anxious Because the guy she was engaged to lives right across the street on a small, west Los Angeles street and you know he knows because I just saw him looking for me from the second floor across the street. About 5 seconds later there is a pounding on the front door. She gets up and speaks to him. The only thing I hear him say is “(her name) What are you doing, we need to talk about this” and she calms him a bit then closes the door on him. We move to the bed and start having sex and she whispers “I love you”, I was so shocked that I think I just said “huh” and then pulled her close and tried to get us to sleep. From the first day we met we were together every day, at first just for parts but after 4 days she had me move in with her. I didn’t leave after that and we were together and inseparable. She would eventually tell me she had to talk to Nick across the street, I understood but wasn’t stoked on it. Eventually I knew that she had just had sex with him 1 of the times, then another. She cheated on me less than 2 weeks into starting a relationship. Sure she was engaged to him but they weren’t dating before the engagement, just friendship. I immediately got resentful and would lash out (not violently or loud) just by pulling back a bit. She didn’t understand that I knew. She wouldn’t let me walk outside without asking me where I’m going or to “not leave me”. She would text about 80 times a day even living together and would call constantly. She had just gotten out of a year long inpatient stay at a hospital for abdominal surgery among countless other things, so she was still coming off of narcotics. She would give me Xanax and adderall for work (when I worked in drug treatment), my mistake not hers. Eventually I got fired so I was worried she would not like me anymore. I tried to show her I loved her by buying her a $300 Pax vaporizer for her weed. She PayPal’d me $400 back for some reason. She didn’t understand that I wanted to get it for her. She didn’t like that I had an Android and she had an iPhone so she ordered me an iPhone and got me on her plan (after about 3 weeks of dating/living together). And she was so into it and it felt like suffocating but I wanted her so bad so I didn’t mind. We withdrew from everyone and we’re our own world, we know needed each other and it was amazing. We eventually started buying OxyContin and would go through $1,000 dollars a day and since she had a tolerance she would “barely feel it”. Her mother who was a doctor and closeted drug addict aswell told her to just “have Zachary (me) inject you with it, it would be close to 100% of the drug”. When I heard that I got a sinking feeling in my stomach but we know where this goes. We got deep into addiction quickly together. Her depressive crying episodes became much more frequent and more intense. She would say things like “you sure you want to marry someone as messed up as I am?” Or “how can you find me attractive?” And I told her that I loved her so much I know we can fix whatever. She proposed to me one night and I was so happy. She produced a silly little owl ring. From that day fourth she was Owlface and I was Foxface, our respected favorite animals. She started getting texts from her abusive ex and I read the texts on her open phone while she was in the shower. (We had a trusting open phone policy) the text read him: we can’t meet at your spot cause of your old man (me) her: (something about meeting at a bar) and then she mentioned that “ my bra and panties match, but I shouldn’t of told you that ;)”. After that I became a lot more cold and distant. Now 3 years later when I only moved out of our 3rd apartment together about 10 month’s ago and after her blocking me 4 times and her getting rid of one of our dogs who was my birthday present a year ago, she says that I was way more abusive than her abusive BF. And that I messed up her life. And now she is the cold distant one and I haven’t stopped crying in months, and I am constantly thinking of suicide and an ok with it. She refuses to remember any of the good stuff or try to see things from my side. And even though we moved to Wisconsin together she says that we have been broken up for over 2 years before I finally left. I am totally lost now.",09Jul2020,1

Other question I'm unsure of is ""Have you ever been hospitalized or had a serious illness within the past 5 years?"" I was admitted to psychiatric hospital for a few days at the beginning of 2017 so would that count as being hospitalized?",09Jul2020,1

78,"2 summers ago, i got my first job at a nail salon. It was really awful. I guess the summer time is really fast paced for nail salons and i have major anxiety, so it didn’t really help. I had minimal training so I was always unsure of what to do. I messed up a lot too. I ended up having like an hour long panic attack on job, hiding it from the customers while continuing to work. But my boss saw me and i broke down in tears from anxiety and i decided to quit on the spot. It was one of my worst moments. 

Ever since then i haven’t held a part time job. 
Recently however i managed to pull myself together and i got accepted into a bakery department in a grocery store as a clerk person. I’m only day two of training and everything is going well! But i keep thinking about what happened at the nail salon job. I can’t stop thinking about it. And i keep comparing it to this new job. It’s like i’m prepping myself for failure again. Or I’m prepping myself to fuck up miserably like how i did at the last job. 

Every day i’m at this new job it’s like i’m walking on egg shells. I’m scared i’m gonna mess up and i’m putting myself at such a high standard because i’m scared that they’ll be disappointed in me if i don’t do a perfect job right away even though it’s unrealistic of me to be perfect because i just started this job????

state w/o telling anyone, keying my own car), and the fact that the only reason i’m not doing drugs is because i can’t afford it, i just think it’s time for me to get some help. with that being said, i’ve very afraid to tell my grandparents that i need and want help. i know they would be supportive and understanding but i just can’t bring myself to say anything. i know this was long winded but moral of the story, i’m looking for some advice, i can’t remember anything and i’m worried for myself. if you’ve read this far, thank you :)",09Jul2020,1

86,"College students are often under a great deal of stress owing to balancing college work, relationships, staying away from their families, illnesses, trying to maintain a balanced diet, trying to manage their friendships and social lives etc. Trying to juggle all these priorities at once can be an overwhelming task, especially when you do not feel comfortable sharing your problems with somebody, or not having anyone trustworthy to share with. [Group counseling](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/individual-therapy/) is a great way to find emotional support, share in a safe environment and find professional help. It is seen that students often hesitate to reach out to a professional for help owing to the stigma of mental health counseling. However, there are several benefits of group counseling that every student must know about. Read out to find out. 

**1.** **Realizing you are not alone and finding the right people to support you**

Do you ever feel like nobody understands you or what you may be undergoing? Well, a [counseling psychologist](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/individual-therapy/) does, and those who are undergoing similar problems do too. and, you can find both these kinds of people under one roof at group counseling. At group counseling, you can share your thoughts, feelings, and problems with a group of people who may be suffering from problems not very different from yours. Not only do you realize that you’re not the only one who may face these problems, but you find support in these people who know exactly how you feel. 

**2.** **The joy of helping and getting help** 

When you attend group counseling, not only do you realize that people you do not know can help you to a great extent but also that you can significantly change somebody’s life by helping them and supporting them. Group counseling isn’t just about having others make a difference in your life, but you are making a difference in their lives too. 

**3.** **Relating and connecting with others** 

There may come a time when you feel like you are disconnected and nobody understands you, neither do you understand others. Group counseling changes that. Group counseling helps you comprehensively understand yourself, as well as others. This helps you to relate to other people’s problems better and connect on a mental and spiritual level. 

**4.** **A sense of liberty and freedom** 

Most teenagers or young adults refrain from sharing their problems with others fearing being misunderstood or judged. Group counseling is a safe space where everyone can share their problems without being afraid of being judged, evaluated, or misunderstood. It can be a liberating feeling to let your thoughts and emotions flow without a bias and free your soul from the cage you put yourself in. Group counseling is almost therapeutic, for when your mind is at ease, you are at ease. 

**5.** **Developing a better, healthier coping mechanism**

Group counseling teaches you how to deal with your problems practically whilst expressing your emotions in a healthy and positive manner. It can equip you with skills to cope with your stressors in a better, healthier way which can result in you focusing on college activities with a fresher mind and looking at the world with a fresher perspective. You could help others deal with their mental health problems too by recommending group counseling in Mumbai and [depression counselling in Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/individual-therapy/) so that they live a mentally healthy life.",09Jul2020,1
88,"Hello all,
     Lately I've been dealing with very bad anxiety. Like I can't function, overwhelming, all consuming anxiety.   I've never had anxiety this badly until the past year. Sometimes I understand the root of it, other times I don't. 
      I have no copping mechanisms for my anxiety. Except biting my nails, but it doesn't really help. 
       What I would like help with especially is dealing with anxiety when it's time to sleep. Take tonight as an example. I'm beyond exhausted. I have a very long day of work ahead of me, and I can't imagine sleeping. 
       My anxiety is keeping me awake. I feel like there is a weight on my chest, my body is shaking a bit, and my mind is on high alert. Unfortunately I am too exhausted to do anything productive, while I'm on high alert, my brain is to groggy to do anything. All I can seem to do is sit in bed and write this post. 
      Does anyone have any ideas to help me overcome my anxiety enough to sleep? I work the next 7 days in a row and can't afford to waste sleep like this. All advise, thoughts, or consideration is welcome. Please help.",09Jul2020,1
89,"I have obsessive thoughts about carving away at myself, mainly my face and back.

I frequently feel dizzy when I’m getting particularly heated in an argument and I instantly lose control of what I say (oftentimes I say something that is both personal and incredibly hurtful towards the person I’m talking to).

I scarcely feel anything emotionally besides anger or hopelessness. All other emotions are either muted or completely absent.

I don’t see the value in life, whether that be my own or someone else’s. The death of a person does not bother me in the slightest (although I hate seeing animals needlessly die) and I equally feel nothing for family or friends. Many people tell me that I need to imagine how my family would feel if I did something, but those words mean absolutely nothing to me.

I have been known to be unrelentingly pessimistic. Everything I say that is intended to be serious is gloomy, depressing, mean-spirited, or otherwise negative.

93,"This is complicated as f*ck so I’ll try my best to give the backstory and context. 

I’m 26F and I’ve been with my partner M for over a year and we live together. M has a group of high school buddies that he grew up with and was really close to, one of which is D. When I was 20, D and I kinda had a thing but he would never commit and strung me along for 2 years till we had an explosive fight and cut all contact (this occurred in 2016). I hadn’t met M at the time because he was a teacher at a school out of state. We just happened upon each other early 2019 and it was pretty awkward when we found out I’d been with D previously but we moved past it. 

D and I are able to have a civil relationship now for the sake of M and recently he has started training us at the gym because he’s a serious body builder and we’re both obese. Tonight we were working out and it had been a great session so far but on our last strength training exercise, I started getting lightheaded. I let D know I had reached my limit and needed to rest but he pressured me to keep going. I struggled through the last rep then cried my eyes out in the locker room for a few minutes.

I honestly can’t explain it. My best guess is that it stems from previously being abused but something about him telling me to keep going after I said I was ready to stop really messed with my head. I almost felt like I was having a PTSD moment but part of me feels that’s a massive overreaction and ridiculous. But I can’t help how I feel right? 

 I only included the stuff about our history because I’m not sure if it’s pertinent. He never hurt me physically when we were together, just emotionally by being distant.

But I feel like he didn't want the kids to suffer and so he stayed to make it work. We've been struggling ever since. I feel like I hold him back due to my insecurities over him wanting other women. I get jealous and triggered easily because I feel like I'm not enough for him, I don't make him happy like I used to. We fight all the time and it's always my fault. I'm trying so hard to change, to heal, to be a better person for him and the kids but we end up in the same pattern because I was triggered. 

I don't want to be the reason why someone is so unhappy yet I am. I'm struggling to be a good mom to our kids because I can't emotionally connect with them. I struggle just to get through the day accomplishing the basic tasks. I feel so hopeless.


(Backstory)  I've struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts since I was 11 yrs old (used to be a cutter) attempted suicide 2 times with no luck before I had my kids. Grew up in an abusive home with a violent alcoholic dad and a narcissist mother who hated I was a girl (she never wanted a girl and tried to miscarry me when she found out). Was the black sheep of the family and was always reminded how unwanted I was. My brother got treated like a king but I was trained to only serve them and keep up appearances that we're a happy family. My dad was in and out of our lives, he was a serial cheater and would leave us whenever he found a new woman to live with. When he was with us it was a rollercoaster of physical and mental abuse, he beat all of us constantly, I feel I was also sexually molested due to how uncomfortable I felt with him and my body growing up. My mom was also a serial cheater and would go out every weekend when my dad was gone. She was emotionally unavailable and highly critical of me. She was more concerned with herself, my dad and brother to be a mother to me. Struggled throughout my life with my self esteem, with body image (was anorexic at 13). I've never had long lasting friendships or relationships. My husband is truly the longest friendship/relationship I've ever had and worry it will be my last. 

I don't want to live anymore, I wish I commited suicide years ago before having my kids. They deserve a better life and a better mom. My husband would have found a better spouse to marry and actually live happily ever after. So much pain and heartbreak I could have prevented if I went through it years ago before having kids. They all deserve better than what I could provide, I'm too broken to be a mother or wife.",09Jul2020,1

Hello Reddit!. I'm contemplating whether i should upload this or not but it's time i seek help. Therapy isn't accessible for me because I'm not in that financial state now. Anyways my question is how do i unlearn my toxic traits. According to me these are my toxic traits.
• Very short tempered : anytime someone says something unpleasant to me my reaction is to storm out and talk back. I hate this. This creates alot of guilt for me and ruins my whole day
• I can't use Nice words to speak my mind : I'm very blunt to the point it can hurt the people I'm talking to. I hate this too as it affects my relationships with parents and friends 
• Due ti these above things I'm unable to make long lasting friends. Idk how I'm able to have a long term relationship with my bf (6 years)
• I can't tolerate bullshit: if someone is bullshiting , instead of letting them do what they're doing, i call them out EVERY. SINGLE . TIME. Like can't i mind my business and let them do what they're doing ??
• Little bit about my childhood: i grew up with a mother who had depression, anxiety and bi polar disorder. I feel like I'm heavily influenced by this.

109,"Hi y'all.

So, first time posting in this subreddit and I'm not entirely sure if this is the right place, so feel free to redirect me to a more appropriate place.

Here is the problem: I turned 32 last friday and I usually take this occasion to give myself some time to think about the year gone by, my current feelings on things and evaluate future plans. While talking with my girlfriend about those topics, I noticed her bringing up some events - things that we experienced in our 10 year long relationship - that I had a hard time remembering. It wasn't just blurry, or some details were missing. I simply had no memory of it, neither vivid nor abstract.

By then I realized how often I had the problem of going along stories of my friends, especially those that directly revolve around, or include, me. It seems like everyone around me has some funny, insightfull or just interesting anecdotes to share, but I can't even connect to those memories on a very basic level so I just go along. Apart from some key moments in my life, a lot seems to be fuzzy, or just nonexistent. This doesn't just apply to events that happened way back, but very specific events that happened rather recently, especially with events revolving around my five year old daughter. If it weren't for pictures that I could reference, I'd be completely dumbfolded. The same applies to sports: I've been training and practizing Ninjutsu for 10 years, two times a week and I'm currently undergoing sort of a mentorship program for aspring trainers, but A LOT of the techniques I can do seem to stem from muscle memory alone. I often don't remember learning them and couldn't name them, even though we have a pretty systematic approach due to them being compiled by similarity in - literally - scrolls. No one of my peers seems to have that issue.

It seems this is getting worse, with more recent memories just fading much, much faster. There is no history of mental health issues, dementia or other neurological disorders in my family that I know of. I don't use drugs, don't take any medication and have a rather healthy lifestyle.  
Does anyone know of this or a similar issue? What approach should I take in order to treat, or get treatment, for this?  


I'd be very thankfull for any sort of help!",09Jul2020,1

And I know i mentioned lots of details but I need to talk about his again I have no one 
Also please don't dm I have very bad social anxiety to the point I can't even text sorry 

Since I was a kid my father was ( and still is ) emotionally and physically abusive since the first day at school I was bullied hard no friends at all even till high school the bullying got worse I got in fights my father would beat me because I was bullied ( not because I fought back just because I was bullied ) he told me lots of bad stuff that still plays back in my mind ( you're a loser you will not be a man ) etc etc we didn't have enough money all the normal bad stuff  so this caused me severe social anxiety I literally avoid every single interaction with people especially girls  which made me very very lonely  , depression  and zero confidence 
Also I had a dream of playing football I didn't continue because my father didn't pay for it and this really hurt me a lot I was good at it 

Now that's not the things that made me lose hope these problems  just gave me strength to change BUT 
In 2018 literally the first day my life went downhill we moved to another place my father started to be more abusive to me more ( which I hate talking about because I am ashamed of ) he started to be more abusive toward my mother  and the thing that made me lose hope finally was bdd ( body dysmorphic disorders ) it's the worst thing ever it makes me feel this huge pressure on my chest and shoulders I can't describe it words it's so painful I just want to go to a cliff and through my self so this feeling just stops

114,"I guess this is mostly a rant, but I’ve been feeling so alone in my own head that I could really use some support. This is the first time I’ve ever opened up about any of this stuff. Here goes: When I was 5, I was diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome, ADHD (combined type), OCD, ODD, and manic depression. 
I am now about to turn 30 (female, FYI). These past 5 years I’ve been doing a lot of therapy and research to understand, for the first time In my life, what ADHD actually looks like and how it effects me. I think the more I understand, the angrier I have become about it. I’m not so sure about ODD because I haven’t done any research into it, but I have recently done a lot of research on OCD and it made a lot of things make a lot of sense. At the same time, it’s made me realize what a cluster f*ck I am. Oh and manic depression is now known as bipolar, which I am not (guess it’s hard to tell when you are 5). My psychiatrist has given me new diagnoses of major depression and generalized anxiety disorder (in place of the manic depression/bipolar). Oh and how can I forget my complex PTSD? 
I spend the majority of my mental energy hating myself. No matter what I accomplish, I can never live up to my own expectations. And I’m always so angry that everything has to be twice as hard for me as it is for a neurotypical person. I finally made two friends who also have ADHD and I thought I’m finally not alone anymore, but I quickly realized I am way more f*cked up than they are.

126," 

This post could probably belong on a few different subreddits but posting here because my mental health seems to be the most emergent issue. I apologize for it’s length.

I was diagnosed with depression at age 13 and after many years of trial and error, drug abuse, hospital stays, therapy and medicine, I was pretty much stable at age 16 and was able to get my life back on track. There was one occasion where I did need to go back on medication but on the whole, I have been able to work through my depressive episodes without medication. I know my “tells” for when I am sinking and have things in place to prevent further slipping. It has become my life, and I accepted it. 

Until a few years ago, I started realizing I was having anxiety. Again, I trusted that I had the tools to deal with it and I figured since I wasn’t having panic attacks, I could be okay. Things continued to decline to the point where I was having a low level of anxiety at all times. But because I was handling my depression pretty well, I told myself I was okay. On top of that, I am married, and a mom with a huge load of responsibilities. I told myself everything was fine because I was functioning and if I wasn’t functioning, then I would do something about it. On top of my everyday life, I am dealing with my family who all suffer from severe mental illness and substance abuse. I have basically become the rock for every single person in my life. Parents, siblings, husband, kids, even friends. 

About 6 months ago, I finally had enough of my husband. I have begged him for years to change. I have asked him to go to therapy, get help, anything. I am tired of being his mother, tired of the way he talks to me and uses my insecurities against me, and tired of his anger issues. I’m tired of being his emotional support person with zero support in return. Of course, at the threat of divorce, he immediately wants help. He goes on medication and begins therapy. He is making great progress but I have not found it in myself to care. I have told him I will stick around, see if the feelings will come back, but how long do I wait? New issues have arose; jealousy, insecurity, etc. Despite trying to put boundaries in place for trying to sort out this mess, we are still fighting constantly.

Now to where I am today. I realize that I have completely spiraled out of control and missed all my “tells”. I have had some pretty scary days mentally and made a pact with myself that if I came up with a suicide plan, I would go to the hospital, however it hasn’t gotten that far yet. I am also trying desperately to avoid going down that road because if I do have an impending divorce, I terrified it will be used against me if there is hospital records. I can not bring myself to focus, and my energy level is in the negatives. It takes every little bit of energy I have just to make sure my children have meals and are clean and healthy. I feel stuck; my husband has no where to go but him being around makes me anxious and depressed. Then I feel guilty for feeling those things because really, we are best friends and on paper, we are the perfect couple. I go from numb to all emotions, to depressed and crying constantly (guilt, shame), to anxious and unsure of what to do with the huge decision that I have to make. The cycle is on repeat, over and over and I don’t see a light at the end of the tunnel at all.

I have also recently been told by a friend that I am a co-dependent. I’ve looked into it and yes, I agree. I am struggling very much with co-dependency issues not only with my husband but with almost every single person in my life. I feel so caught up in the identity of being everyone’s savior, a mother, a wife, that I have no idea who I am any longer. I have known nothing else my entire life but being the “strong” one. My husband and I married young and I never took the chance to be alone and independent (even though I strongly prefer space and being alone) I have built my identity up around making others happy. I want to be my own person again (or for the first time I guess). I am even to a point where I am not even sure if I ever was or am capable of romantic love. I am pretty sure there is a strong, independent woman in there somewhere, but she is buried and the only solution I can see for making her reemerge is letting go of my co-dependent relationships, being alone and finding myself. That all sounds pretty right? I wish I could follow through and actually do it. The thought of actually doing it makes me nauseous for wanting to be so selfish and upon rereading this all I feel my complaints are trivial and really don’t matter in the scheme of life. 

I have children who are depending on me to be the best mother possible and I feel I fail them more and more each day. I feel I have failed them by staying in a marriage where I am not happy, but will also fail them if I go. I can’t make sense of any emotion or even trust what I am thinking or feeling.

There are obvious answers, I have scheduled an appointment to be seen and put back on anti-depressants. Hopefully therapy will follow soon after but, I do know waiting lists are long and it worries me that I will be stuck in limbo without these things for a few weeks. 

No matter what though, no amount of medication of therapy is going to change the fact that I feel I am caught up in this situation that is dragging me down to what feels like impossible depths. Realistically, no one on reddit can change any of that, I know that. But I guess I am searching for my ‘aha moment”. Something, anything, to skew the cycle even a little bit to where I feel there may be some hope. I’m looking for how to cope with this new reality that I don’t have the tools for. Most of all, I think I just need to organize my thoughts into writing. I’d appreciate any and all feedback.",09Jul2020,1

—context—
The last year or so for me has been incredibly rough. i’d say a little over a year ago or so i was hospitalized in a mental institution and diagnosed with depression. Everything with that went pretty well actually the medicine started to help me drastically and it just worked. well i’m 18 now just graduated and my family is moving to florida in like 20 days, i don’t plan on going. we’ve already talked about this no hard feeling either way but we agreed it would probably be good for me to get out and kinda figure some of this life shit out. Moving in with a friend of mine very soon, like in the coming days.

—the deal—
idk where to really start so i’ll just start typing i guess. recently my dreams have been indistinguishable from reality. not so much as my memories are getting messed up but it’s a little weird at times. I have a couple of reoccurring ‘characters’ you could call them in my dreams that have never really stood out to me as much as they do now. The one we’re focusing on is the girl, i guess we can call her alex. so a couple of days ago i had to go get a washer and dryer with my step father. when i woke up i was super confused about something but i couldn’t remember what i had dreamt about that night. i instinctively started to scroll through my snapchat looking for alex to ask what the hell was happening. i caught myself doing it and i immediately was put off by my own actions. Tried not to think too much of it as i was groggy as it was so i took a shower and took my medicine as i do everyday. As we were driving to get the goods my mind was going at an immeasurable speed, thoughts about my dream were just in and out and i don’t remember a single thing from that ride except one thing. reality set in, ive known from that moment on this alex girl doesn’t exist. I’m not sure completely what happened but after i got home i had started to profusely sweat all over my body. As soon as it started i felt nauseous and went outside and puked all of my medicine up, i felt like i was dying honestly. i sat out on my porch puking and dripping with sweat for maybe 15 minutes at most, after that i felt fine. After that day everything has been unnatural. 

—symptoms?—
Since that day my stomach has been in pain off and on, i’ve been seeing things(nothing crazy just not like it use to be when i would see something out of the corner of my eye), my mind feels ‘full’ i guess my thoughts go by one after another and sometimes i can’t keep up at all, my emotions are out of check i’ll start crying one minute for no reason then the next i’m fine, hell as i’m writing this it’s hard to keep focused, again as i’m writing this i’ve been losing sleep just bc my mind is too busy. 

these last 2 won’t make sense. 

i’ve been getting INTENSE feelings of deja vu just randomly no matter what i’m doing that’s been worsening for a couple days and the last one is harder to describe, things have been different. for example, i was driving my mom home from getting food just today and we were going down the same roads we do everyday but the mountains and terrain around us was odd. it’s like someone had changed the littlest thing but i noticed, they were not the same. 




For anyone who read all this thanks for trying to understand. Recently besides the crazy stuff my life has been improving drastically just by itself. a year ago i was so sad everyday, it was effecting me so bad i tried to take my own life but thankfully didn’t succeed. Since the meds have been trying to get better and these last months have been awesome. But now i’m losing it, i feel like i’m going crazy and i’m not in control, now i’m afraid to take my medication bc i don’t want to be sick again. eh maybe i am too stressed out with everything that’s happening in my life rn but this doesn’t feel like stress.sorry if this is all over the place.",09Jul2020,1

136,"Okay so to clarify, I am on testosterone and am during injections into my stomach. Recently this last month in a half, now close to two months, my anxiety has flared up horribly right as I am about to give myself the shot. I’m particularly stuck on what happened during my shot from a week back, Tuesday. At this point I was about 45 minutes into trying to do this. To go food had arrived at my house and my roommate let me know. Anytime I would calm down enough to give myself the shot I would stop myself from hitting the skin. 

Suddenly one second the syringe is in my hand and the next it is in my stomach and I have no memory of inserting the needle it’s just there. This freaks me out for I jump and am very confused. I was like “hey uh it’s in guess I’ll keep going with this.” Told my roommate, who also is on T and does injections he doesn’t say anything about it. I then told my therapist on Thursday, she wasn’t concerned with it either. 

Am I just fixated on this too much or is there a cause for concern? I’ve had some issues with dissociation and doing this here and there through the day but nothing that bad and sudden. I as said I’ve had some issues with dissociation before but nothing along the lines of sudden and complete gaps, it truly scared me, and still does. I was worrying about this happening against during my last shot, this past Tuesday.

This weeks shot I couldn’t do it either had to have my roommate do it for me, I was shaking and getting mad so not a good combo for trying to give a shot. 
Advice or clarification please?",09Jul2020,1

Like really, none. My best friend turned her back on me from the constant internal battle I’ve been dealing with. My family is not a good place to go for any emotional support. I met one of the most wonderful men. I’m so damaged that I have slowly and effectively pushed him away. It’s like I don’t even want to be happy. But, I do. I want to feel heard and that someone actually cares about me. I’ve tried a couple therapists, but it was so uncomfortable at the time. And not on the telling my deepest darkest struggles, but in the sense that I feel judged and not accepted as I am. And Everything feels so chaotic. I have some physical health issues that are weighing heavy on me right now and just nowhere to turn to. I have a big birthday coming up and no one to spend it with.

my parents like to remind me that im the smart one. ill pay for their care when they are older so i have to get a good job but anytime i bring up something im always shot down. i dont understand or im giving them attitude. 

my little sister has stolen over £200 off me over the past 5 months and anytime i bring it up. all i get is well you shouldnt have left it around. my little sister hasnt done any school work for the past month over quarantine and  they expected me to tutor her while im in sixth form studing history law and business. when i said im busy they said too bad and you have to do it and when i told them she wouldnt listen to me they said they would take her phone. my mum says my dad will take it my dad doesnt as he said its her problem if she doesnt want to do her work. this is one situation of so many. 

all my family tells my parents that she is spoiled but they say she'll grow out of it. 

my big sister is a narcissist anytime something goes wrong she throws a temper tantrum. shes 24 with a kidand they try and fix what inconvenienced her. An example of this is that my parents already paid of her debt of over £2000 less then 8 months ago and now shes in bad debt again. 

my only escape from this family has been my nan and she just diagnosed with parkinsons. i honestly dont know what to do anymore i know that they're so toxic but their still my family amd as much as they have pit me through i do love all of them so much. Though i dont think i can survive here much longer cause i generally cant remember the last time i was happy and honestly i catch myself wanting to end it all too many time to count.",09Jul2020,1
143,"Tuesday I had my latest session with my therapist.
(Please see previous posts for a recap.)

Forgoing the normal session opening banter, I/we got right into the sword of Damocles that had been hanging above my head.

In my previous post I spoke to the abandonment issues that have become part of an underlying theme .

I asked her what were her plans were concerning the reassignment of my therapy to another counselor in the agency.

I had thought that with the time I had spent with her under the auspices of her agency, I would be transferred to another therapist.
However, she informed me that that would not be the case.

I would have to reapply to the agency for another therapist and there was a waiting list of approximately 6 to 7 months.

(One reason I chose this agency was my ability to pay for their services.
I don't have insurance and would be unable to pay a private therapist's fees.)

I asked her due to the fact that we had been working together for almost a year, was there any way for her to wave the waiting period and  have the agency assigne another therapist.
""No our agency doesn't work that way.""

Frankly I think this a bullshit way of treating clients.

So, of the many questions I have,
If your therapist called it quits and offered you no direct assistance in finding you another to take her place what would you do?

Second, do you think this is ethical behavior on her and or the agencies part?

On top of that I do not relish the idea of starting over again with a new therapist.

Yet, while I have come a long way in the last year, a new ""set of ear's"" might be a good thing.

Hey, I know let's fuck with the clients head over their abandonment issues and drop them from our client list without anyplace to turn.",09Jul2020,1

My mum never understood it and always tried to help me get over it but I couldn't so now friendships and many relevant people are a sore subject. It has been like this as long as I can remember and could this be related to schizoaffective disorder from so early on or is it just my 'personality'?

I am new here, and this is my first post. TW loss? I am sorry, I don’t know how exactly this works here... 

I have a question and hope I don’t sound too stupid asking it.
Roughly 1 1/2 years ago my cat, who was really precious to me, but also really old, deceased. While driving to the vet, to help her she moved on. At that time a song played in the radio I really loved and I couldn’t listen to it since, because of the memories it triggered. But I still have it in my playlist in hopes to be able to hear it again without crying. 
Since the feeling of loss itself got way better I would like to know if there is a way I can kinda ,train‘ myself to change the connotation I have with this song, or should I just avoid it altogether?

As I said, I hope this question isn’t too weird and I would love to hear your input.",09Jul2020,1

I've been struggling with my mental health for a long time and this past 6 months has been pretty bad with right now being a peak difficult time (Unrelated to Coronavirus I believe). 

I've been having suicidal thoughts for most of that 6 months. But also on and off for at least 10-15 years. 

For the past 2 months, I've been going back and forth trying to decide if I need to check myself in to a hospital or not. 

About 3 weeks ago, I had a plan for suicide and a date of 2 weeks later. Obviously I didn't do that since I still here. And now I don't want to. 

I'm currently working at a major company as a summer intern. I interviewed and got the job back in October (before the downhill mental health spiral). It started mid May and will end mid August. It is an amazing opportunity and has already meant a huge difference for my husband and I financially. 

But I'm doing a horrible job at it. It's taking me 6 weeks to complete things I should have completed in 3 days. Through no fault of the company, it is just stressing me out even more and not allowing me the chance to take care of myself. 

I've decided I need to quit. I know there's only a month left, but I just can't anymore. I need to be better before fall semester and I need to take care of myself and I think the job is preventing me from doing that. 


TL;DR
So my question is: How does one quit a job (especially and internship) for mental health reasons? I can't put in two weeks, and it won't hurt them if I leave anyway. Should I tell them it is because of mental health? What should I say? This job is entirely online, with few verbal meetings; can I do this over email? What do I say?

I'm ending my pharmacy studies and, on Monday, I'll start working as practices, unpaid. Even though I know I'm capable of dealing with any given situation (because in the past happened lots of times) I'm afraid I won't be able to... Do okay. Like it's too much for me, I won't be prepared etc.

165,"Like probably most of the people on this sub I’ve been struggling a lot recently. It got to a pretty bad point where I felt like I needed some sort of outside help, but I avoided it for weeks because the process of finding a therapist was daunting and the sessions expensive.

Finally I decided to try one of the app based services (BetterHelp) so I just wanted to share my experience in case it helps anyone else. I have not tried any other services so I don’t know how it compares.

That being said, it seems reasonably priced and it’s been fairly helpful for me. First you select some options about yourself and what you’re looking for then they match you with a therapist.

You get unlimited chat with your therapist and one 30 minute live video session per week. Even though the chat is unlimited I don’t think it should be used for lengthy discussion or expect a back and forth. Mostly, my therapist will send 1  or 2 articles a week and ask some questions to get me thinking. At first I was like, is this chat automated? So I asked her... My therapist responded back: “I am the one sending you the messages. In my introduction, I mentioned that I send weekly articles. Sometimes I send quotes. There are 164 hours in a week and you only meet with me for 30 minutes a week. Hopefully, the articles will encourage you to work on yourself in between sessions.” We had our first session this week and it went well, but if not, I believe you can easily request a new therapist.

The various therapists’ on the platform also have webinars to discuss different topics live where you can post questions and such with other users.

Overall I think it’s a good resource and it fit what I needed in terms of flexibility. Also, I think it’s reasonably priced. The pricing is set up so that if you commit to a longer subscription it’s cheaper per week. See below:

- $80/week if billed weekly
- $65/week if billed monthly
- $45/week if billed quarterly
- $35/week if billed yearly

I know I’ve seen discount codes on Snapchat though for 30% off (I think it was “SNAP30”) but I saw it after I had already signed up.

Also, if anyone wants to try it out, DM me and I can send you a link for 2 weeks free.",09Jul2020,1
166,"Ok, this is going to be long. I’m here because I believe that I’m starting to see some patterns in my life that are of cause for concern to me. I’ve been in therapy for about 10 months and even though I think it will be beneficial long term, I think it’s pulled some things out of me and thrown them into the light. I hope I can get some opinions here on my thoughts below. 

I’ve always been a little bit different than others, starting from as far back as I can remember. My childhood in general is very blurry, with only a few memorable events. I know I always felt unusual, not accepted and made very few friends. If I ever made a friend, it was usually just one and we would become very close for a while, but eventually I always pulled away from them. I don’t know why I pulled away in almost all cases, even to this day. 

My childhood before the teenage years were probably more “normal” in social interaction than after I went into my teens. In my teens, I became even more closed off to others, never felt accepted in any groups. My parents tried to get me into team sports, but even this never bonded me with my teammates. I always felt rejected or not aligned with the others on my team. In high school I eventually made a group of friends, which I eventually and inevitably parted ways with. 

During my teenaged years I grew increasingly inward facing, rarely socializing with anyone outside of my family. I was and continue to be highly empathetic at times, sometimes too empathetic and/or forgiving. Other times, I felt and continue to feel very little empathy towards others. During these years (14-19) I remained isolated, and even created a second “me”, a “rebirth” if you will. I studied and learned a new language to the point of becoming native level fluent, started lying about my ancestry claiming to be someone else, and created a completely different version of myself. I felt this version of myself was interesting, worthy of being liked, accepted and loved by others outside of my family. 

My whole college career of four years was lived through this personality. I became much more talkative, loud, sexually suggestive to almost anyone, but very much felt as if it were a mask that I was wearing. But I was “happy” to be able to feel worthy or interesting to other people. It was during this time I finally accepted my sexuality, which I had been wrestling with for the prior decade. I started dating, but only showed my created personality, knowing the true me wasn’t interesting, attractive or good enough. 

Eventually I found my first true love, someone who rocked my world. I took off my created mask, and was myself. I fell in love, hard. This relationship eventually ended, and I was absolutely crushed. Depressed for months, cried harder than if someone died. The mask went back up. 

I dated again, nothing serious, but was moving on (or so I thought.) I continued to act loud, suggestively, seductively ect. I graduated college, got my first job, which I was fired from in 8 months for performance issues. 

I got another good job some months later in a high stress environment, where I developed an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. It helped me escape the stress and the anxiety that was starting to become a real problem, but I didn’t recognize the internal discomfort and fight-or-Flight instinct that was becoming my base line. This is when the insomnia started becoming a big problem, but alcohol helped with that too.

I eventually started to become paranoid of seeing my first ex anywhere I went. It was always on my mind. I tried to rationalize, that if I saw him, it wouldn’t be the end of the world but my mind would always take control and I was always theorizing how to remove myself from a situation where he might appear (in the subway, street, ect.) it became my priority whenever I was out of the house and started avoiding leaving the house when not necessary for work or other essential reasons, just to ease my anxiety and panic.

I eventually found another job after becoming increasingly unhappy and feeling unappreciated, and walked into an even worse position, that paid way better but caused more stress and had a toxic work environment. I couldn’t deal with the expectations and was fired after 6 months. Towards the end of those 6 months, the ex who had broken my heart in college reappeared and swept my off my feet after a long courting stage where he promised me the world and promised he had changed and wanted to marry me. I naively believed this, and subsequently dealt with his narcissistic personality disorder And abuse for 1.5 years. During that time my alcohol use became increasingly unhealthy. He then broke up with me again, which was another period of deep, zombielike depression.

My former “mask” was destroyed, and my real personality showed itself. I now feel somewhat numb, without much self value. I can’t seem to identify many, or any positive features of myself. 

I eventually identified and confronted my anxiety, which is persistent and prevents me from doing basic things like going to the market or even taking a walk due to the paranoia of running into my ex or being ridiculed by strangers, or making myself look dumb in public.  It also manifests itself physically, as I am in constant fight-or-flight, with tense muscles most of the time. 

I also acknowledged my depression, which has been underlying in my life for the majority of it. I am taking medication for the depression now, hoping it helps. 

At times, I’m very easily overstimulated. Too much movement or loud noise can send me into a state where I have a very hard time processing, and I almost feel as if I can’t focus on a single point or thought, and my mind completely detaches from itself and it’s very uncomfortable. 

I have only one friend, who I care for deeply but increasingly I find myself making excuses to not see or talk to her, which has happened in every other friendship in my life. I don’t want to lose her but am also completely apathetic 90% of the time in regards to the thought of losing her due to my self isolation. I want love but can’t imagine the thought of dating, I like people (generally) but can’t imagine going to social outings without drinking a bottle of wine beforehand. I have cut down on the alcohol as of late due to my depression medication and feel good about that, but the thought of socializing without it and being my “real” self is scary and prevents me from being able to do it. 

I know this is a lot but at the same time probably hard to recognize as a pattern. I’m going to a psychiatrist next week because I’m hoping to weed out the negative parts of my personality, but does anyone have any theories as to what could be going on with me? I appreciate any ideas",09Jul2020,1

169,"This might be a long post but bear with me because I have not been on Reddit for very long and I’m just looking for some advice on what to do...If I even can do anything.. I was with my ex for five years, we share a child and I also have a child from a previous relationship. His mom and dad are divorced, he is divorced and both of the women in his life left him in abandoned him. In the beginning we were completely fine and would have little arguments here and there but then things will get better and we will just go about our day and forget it. So I thought. (He would hold on and would bring up later) The manic episodes, the anger, emotional and verbal abuse only got worse to the point where I had to move out of the house with both of my kids but we were in close proximity so when we would get back together he would come over here and stay here but still have his place. As time went on and it did get worse, he would get super angry to the point where veins pop out, he would start waving his arms, talking real fast and his eyes would get dilated. It would be super scary. He would say the most horrible things to me and then later on when I would confront him, it was like he didn’t remember saying it or he didn’t do it or he would justify to why he said it.. Nothing was ever his fault. Small example my finger was slammed in the refrigerator door on accident by him he would not even take responsibility for that or say oh I’m sorry are you OK? I have been reading books about borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder and a lot of it fits the bill. He makes a rational decisions without thinking and then regrets it later. It has only gotten worse because now these decisions that he’s making have affected me in my life so much as well as the kids. He does not see it nor will he acknowledge it. He feels a sense of entitlement and power in always wants an apology from me. Like he is put on a pedestal. I have never got Actual sincere one from him. He always wants instant gratification and praise. I’ve always tried to do my best and learn his love language until I actually got on Reddit and found some sub Reddit‘s with people that do the exact same things that he does. These arguments happen like clockwork and I know exactly which month of the year and when it happens. It’s very consistent. His father passed away last year unexpectedly and you still love me but then hated me because he would vent to him about our problems but would never take responsibility for his actions. I was there for him through that time and then four months ago, we decided to start fresh and start the homebuying process with a fresh start for our family. We were looking at houses one day and everything was amazingly great so I thought and then the next day he had a manic episode end it was ended again.. I think I was the cause of that because I got a message on private messenger saying that he was cheating and I confronted him but I was very emotional because I didn’t know what to think. He gets angry all the time and runs back to his house and I don’t see him for the rest of the night so I don’t know what he’s doing but I would’ve never thought that he would be cheating. When I came to him he did not show me any reassurance or comfort me in anyway. He just blew up and turned it on me. I mean, what would anyone do if they got a message like that? How would they feel? I tried to tell him that. How would you feel if you got that? He threw in the towel because he said the trust is gone and then that’s where the nightmare really started because of impulsive actions.  He did a lot of things without thinking in such a short period of time. He listed the place with a realtor that he found online and he started looking for a house by himself. My mother is a realtor and gave him money for some of the costs to buy. She doesn’t want anything to do with him now.. burned that bridge. I was with him when I got my real estate license so that hurt me very bad because I felt like he betrayed me. I was supposed to list it but I was very hesitant because when we would argue, that was his Safehaven to run back to and what would happen if he did not have that? I was trying to buy time so I could get him the proper help. On Father’s Day, I decided to get him a card and some flowers as well as my other daughters father because we have a really good coparenting relationship. But in his specific card, I apologized I took responsibility for my part of the hardships in our relationship. And then I said I hope that one day we can be friends. Two days later I got a letter from an attorney about our daughter. That’s what killed me because he knew with my first daughter, we went through a pretty nasty court experience and I told him I never want to ever experience that again. And he’s doing it. It’s almost like he’s self sabotaging this relationship. But we were his family and every single time that we broke up, I was still here. Maybe not physically in his house but mentally, I was and I always waited for him.My parents don’t wanna have anything to do with him at all in my older daughter still loves him but is very hurt by what he is doing. I have tried not to abandon this man just like every other woman that he loved his life have done but it’s to the point now where there are lawyers involved and he is just so unbelievably nasty to me. I know that this is not him, and I have told him that I blame his illness and not him and to please get help and he is still in denial and pretty much calling me crazy and then I need to MoveOn. I don’t understand because he still gets super jealous if I have a guy friend over or if he sees a car across the street at my house and he doesn’t know who it is. So it’s like, one personality hates me and the other one absolutely loves me and they are fighting each other. I’ve been through so much emotional pain and I have tried to get him to get help. I think that he thinks if he moves into another house, but the pain will go away and he will go back to normal. I don’t think that’s the case. I believe his father had the same issue and now he does or has always had it. He got his medical marijuana card he got first, I thought he was getting better because he was smoking weed all day but now I’m learning that it only makes it worse as it has gotten worse. I feel that all of his hatred is for me because I moved out of our place that we live together but I was just really tired of him kicking me out every day. I’m trying to understand and learn more because he will be in my life for a very long time because of our daughter. I worry about his mental state but I know that he is most happy when he is with her so I would never take that away from him..Or at least I don’t want to ever. In the back of my mind I still am worried slightly about her safety but I have to keep telling myself she is fine and he loves her. I am so lost because I love this man so much and I would do anything for him but he is just so nasty to me and he keeps on doing all of these actions to self sabotage any future we could have. I’m 38 years old And I’ve dated a lot of people but we just have such a strong connection that when I’m crying at my home  I feel like that he’s crying at his home. We never had any intimacy issues as that was so electric I can’t even explain it. I try to talk to him and even be super emotional with him but it’s like that triggers him and he starts talking fast and being completely nasty and mean. How did you get your loved ones help? Or how did you get help if you have these feelings? What was that breaking point of realization?

170,"Hey guys first time posting here! I was recently reassessed after 4 years because my old treatment wasn’t working. Instead of just having Anxiety they have concluded that I suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder. Im not even sure what it is but I guess I have it. They recommended more antidepressants and DBT. In the past I’ve taken some SSRI meds and gone to CBT, which didn’t work at all for me. I’m a little nervous about taking antidepressants again because of the side effects I got. Are there any meds that help depression that aren’t SSRI? Also has anyone had any luck with DBT? I read about it and it seems pretty intense. In my assessment I mentioned some symptoms that suggested I’ve been suffering from minor psychosis. They agreed but said it’s best that we wait it out and monitor it, because I’m so young (only 20). He said that usually disorders involving psychosis will fully develop in women in their late 20s, and that hopefully this therapy will make it go away. So I’m not on an antipsychotic. Anyway, I’m pretty scared and nervous I’m going crazy and I just don’t know what to expect. Would really appreciate some advice. Thanks!",09Jul2020,3

There were a lot of reasons...but mainly because of financial stuff and I am scared that I really am not mentally ill and just having some ""bad days"" and they'll judge me for ""riding the trend"" or some bullshit like that.

I think I read too much stuff on mental illness and go on online quizzes to check my mental health. That I am now so fucking confused if I'm a fake.

But what I really wanted to ask is... how do you know when to actually need to seek professional help?

When I'm having a ""bad day""... I tend to lose all my energy, get irritable and just lose my overall vibe to talk to anyone. Sometimes, cry a little too much. I have also suicidal thoughts, but it's all just thoughts anyways and have tried self harm (just tiny needle poking on feet, no big deal) I also think that I dwell too much on small matters, like overanalyzing a conversation that happened 2 years ago and will keep bugging my head for weeks/months. I just feel like shit.

But when I'm having a good day or just have a goal or something good occupying my mind... I feel like I can conquer the world and read self improvement stuff or just go out there and be my best self. And looked like a fucking extrovert.

I'm here asking for help regarding an issue I've been facing. You see, I've come to understand that I fear Eternal Damnation. This started with a little thought experiment before, just one where if you didn't do x you would be eternally punished. However, this fear has shifted. The ideas shifted, slowly, from something more scientifically based to ideas less and less scientifically based. 

Now, however, I struggle with Descarte's Demon. The idea that there is an entity manipulating everything I see, feel, touch, hear. Everything.

180,"TL;DR: What would you have liked your friends from home/college to do or say to you while you were away at one of these programs to make you feel like they cared about you without smothering you?

A good friend (M20) of mine (F20) is in an inpatient therapeutic facility for teens/young adults. He's now there voluntarily after a fall semester (also voluntary) in a hard-core wilderness program. Right now, he's in what I think is a young adult version of a therapeutic boarding school as a sort of transitional period after last semester in the woods. He chose the programs himself and has said multiple times that they saved his life.

We were best friends for our freshman year in college, but he had to leave due to mental health issues last spring. \[Just to clarify, I'm gay and there's never been anything remotely romantic, we were just good friends.\] We've facetimed a few times, and he's responding to texts sporadically, sometimes not at all, although I know that he has access to his phone for at least part of every day. I'm not taking it personally, but I do wonder at what point I'm supporting him and at what point I'm bothering him when he's trying to get better.

Also, when we do talk or text, I'm struggling with how much to ask him about what's going on in his life. I absolutely want him to feel like he can talk to me and I want to know what's going on in his life and I don't want him to feel like I'm treading carefully around him, but I don't want to pry or seem nosey. I've been trying to keep it light so far, but we used to have really deep, good talks and I miss that part of our friendship. Is asking him how he's feeling too much? Are there topics that you guys think I should steer clear of?

I was wondering if I could get some insight from people who have been in his situation. What could a friend on the outside have said or done to make you feel supported and like people from your life outside the facility still cared deeply about you without smothering you during a vulnerable time in your life? Do I keep checking in periodically or give him space? Do I ask him questions or let him initiate and share what he wants to? What did you want from your friends when you left the facility?  Any insight/advice would be very much appreciated.

The last year I was dating a guy that recently broke up with me that year I felt so happy to be alive everything felt amazing and now that he's gone I'm back at with the same feeling if not worse. 

I just don't understand why I feel this way while everyone else around me seems to be very satisfied with life and enjoy being alive.

I feel as though I'm just living so I dont hurt people I love even though I don't feel happy.

Even when I do fun things like go swimming, paint or play guitar at the back of my mind, almost at all times I just don't feel like all of this is worth it or it's ever been worth it.

183,"Tldr at the bottom. 

For context, I am a 32f recently diagnosed with ADHD. Every year my job role has changed, either moving companies, departments or moving up. I do my jobs as best I can and the moving up has always been from great work and feedback. I have a variety of different qualifications and certificates, none of which relate or fit into the other. 

Now however, I am a product owner and for the first time in my life, stayed in a role for over a year.

As such, I started to struggle. Losing motivation, focus, will power and it's affecting my mental health. I am breaking down with crying fits, screams of rage and anger at myself and the way things are going. It was this that pushed me to seek help with the doctor and ended up with the diagnosis. 

It doesn't help that in my current workplace, the management are disorganised and micromanage. Priorities change daily, reports out my ears and support requests left right and centre that are just escalated straight to me without the proper troubleshooting. And people wonder where my time goes. 

I am currently waiting to see a specialist to get a referral for medication to help with the ADHD as I suspect this is causing some of my grief. Having only recently found out was distressing and a relief as suddenly my whole life, and especially my time at school, make complete sense with even the suspicion that my late father may have also had it, as I am incredibly like him. I have already had to deal with the stigma that ""girls don't get ADHD"" and the ""you're just lazy"", ""you need to focus"" etc at work. 

I have been using a meditation app, Headspace, to try and manage the stress, to regain focus but more so to help shut off my brain and be able to sleep. But it's super hard to meditate when my brain just does not shut up. The sleep however has been very successful! So that's a plus at least! 

Tldr:
I think what I am asking for, is if anyone has any books, videos or services, anything you can suggest and recommend, to help me not only come to terms and deal with ADHD, but deal/manage it for work. I am so exhausted that I feel close to just shutting down. I am terrified of losing myself. 

Thank you in advance.

I've had this mentality pretty much throughout my life and a few years back after feeling like I was going to lose it decided to go to the doctors who prescribed me 100mg sertraline(SSRI) which I took for a few years accompanied by smoking weed everyday(stupidly).

Eventually I felt enough was enough and managed to drop everything, weed, tobacco and the tablets because I felt good, clear minded and wanted to get healthier, but recently I find myself every couple of days having just a couple drinks to kind of take the edge off life as the stuck in my thoughts mentality returned, I much prefer my attitude and confidence after just 1 or 2 drinks.

188,"I constantly think about what I am going to eat next. I am currently not eating high carb items such as bread and pasta (trying to do keto but I am also cutting out high fat foods too), I try to eating under 1000 calories a day. And I go on a 5km walk everyday.

For the last 4 years I have been like this, I think it was caused by comments from peers for 2 years in school, I wouldn't tell anybody and began self harming. When my parents found out they were really upset and felt worried for me, I never got real help, only one or two sessions with an untrained staff member at school. For a while I felt better, but I never really stopped measuring what I eat. Because I didn't tell anyone about how I felt, I began to try and make myself 'tougher' by telling myself that I needed to stop being a crybaby. I am quite an emotional person I admit, I take things really personally if someone calls me fat or ugly as an insult, I usually would go home and cry for two hours when I received comments like this everyday once I began secondary school \*highschool for americans\*  (this rarely now as I am older, and I have found that not showing emotion tends to make people leave you alone).

I really do hate myself, I feel sick when looking at myself in the mirror, I see everyone around me (my friends and just people in general) and it makes me upset to see people I know as I just feel like the ugly and fat friend. My parents tell me I am pretty but tbh I feel like they have to since I am their daughter. I use a calorie app to measure what I eat. I have never really considered myself anorexic as I am not terribly skinny, my dad says I am but I don't think so. (I am about 5\*6 and weigh 9 stone 1 pound, I am 17 years old). It's been getting worse recently again to the point where I feel like I am gonna relapse self harm. I think I have OCD but I have never been told properly by a doctor. I find myself flicking light switches 3 times because I am worried If i don't i will gain weight. I also don't eat my tea until 6pm (it recently became later and I now have it at 8pm), If i eat before these times I will go into a self harm sort of panic attack. If i ever argue with my parents over food or eat too much, I repeatedly smack myself on my thighs or head as a way to punish myself from eating. I constantly have bruises on my legs. I also skin pick my arms at times when i get anxious, sometimes the thought of eating actually makes me feel sick. 

At times I have had really worrying thoughts, I know it sounds weird but I have thought about the idea of loosing limbs as a good thing, as it would make me loose weight. I have it when people call me 'big' or 'tall' and have a sort of complex with being 'small'. I really just want some sort of confirmation from anyone who has experienced the things I am currently experiencing, I am looking for a reason behind my issue. My dad has offered to take me to the doctors, but I am worried that If i get written down as a 'special kid' that it will effect me in my later life.

198,"First post here, so hi everyone. Sorry in advance for the length of my post, I just need to vent.

It took me about a month to finally come out of this temporary setback I just experienced with my mental health, and although I’m happy I was able to dig myself out of that hole, I’m also really sad and frustrated with myself because said hole made me lose out on a potential friendship with someone I liked, and was growing to care about.

I’ve always had social anxiety, especially when it comes to talking with girls. Over the years, it’s been slowly getting better, but it’s still there.

When this quarantine started, I got on Tinder for the first time, and met a girl there who I started talking to for a few months. We got along well, and over time, we were really starting to vibe, and things were going pretty good. It felt like there was some actual potential there. We even opened up one night about traumas in our lives, something I have a lot of trouble with, and cried together, and it was just a beautiful experience to me. I have abandonment issues from when I was a kid, so to me, forming bonds is hard, but when they happen, they’re extremely special to me, to the point where those bonds are sacred. This made me really start liking this girl. I felt like things were clicking.

We went out on a date, which we both thought went well, even though I wasn’t myself.  I kept saying the first thing that popped into my mind because of how nervous, and excited, I was to be on a date for the first time in years, plus I didn’t want things to get silent and awkward since we were both shy, so some of the things I said weren’t the whole truth, and it didn’t help that I was presenting myself as this excitable, happy-go-lucky extrovert, when I’m actually a shy, melancholic introvert.

After the date, she stopped talking to me for a few days, as she had something going on, and my abandonment issue triggered, and I started overthinking that she wasn’t interested in me after the date, and that she had ghosted me.

When we finally started talking again, I was still in that funk, and a part of me feels that it threw our vibe off. She ended up wanting to be just friends, which I initially said I was okay with, but then said I wanted us to go out on a second date so that I could be more myself, as I thought she wasn’t interested in me anymore because of how I presented myself on our date, and in my mind, the second date could show her the “real” me.

I’m the kind of person who takes their time in opening up when I’m in person with someone. I can be witty, laid back, and confident, and everything else through text and voice chat, but it takes me a while to get there when I’m in person. I’m like a little turtle in his shell, who’s slowly coming out. I became fixated on the idea that things were falling apart because of how she perceived me on the date.

She said she’d have to think about it, and I was perfectly fine with whatever she ended up deciding. If we went out again, great. If not, oh well, it is what it is.

Unfortunately, I was still overthinking over the next two-three weeks since she said she’d think about it, and I kept insisting that I wasn’t myself, and blamed myself for us not vibing, which kept pushing her away. Ironically, in my not wanting to screw things up, I kept screwing things up, to the point where she stopped talking to me completely.

I want to make it clear that I don’t harbor any bad feelings whatsoever against this girl, by the way. If anything, now that my head’s clear, I completely understand why she stopped talking to me, and I hope she finds happiness in her life, and that she can heal from her traumas.

I’m just fucking frustrated with myself because I pushed her away, when we could’ve at least been friends, and could have kept her in my life in some way. I can take rejection no problem, my problem is that I feel like I got mentally blindsided by the sudden 180, where we went from vibing, and being attracted to each other, to things just being meh, and I couldn’t, for the life of me, wrap my head around what was happening, and kept trying to explain why to myself. That, combined with my overthinking and overanalyzing, just made everything blow up in my face, and I hate it. I hate that I’m like that.

It bugs me so fucking much because that slip up makes me feel like all the progress I’ve done over the years to improve my mental health means nothing, that I’m still stuck near the beginning of the journey, and worst of all, it cost me a bond that I was forming with someone.",09Jul2020,3
200,"Before I start I just want to put a trigger warning for sexual and emotional abuse and self harm. 


So two years ago I was in a relationship with a boy my age. He was extremely abusive emotionally and sexually (I wasn’t ever penetrated in any way) 

When I came out of that one thing led to another and I had to report him to the police. Everything came out and I had to fill out a sexual assault report. At the time I was so traumatised I don’t think I relayed what happened correctly and left details out. The police officer then told my parents that it was ‘kids stuff’ (we were both 14) and even with his confession it wouldn’t be enough to get a conviction and they don’t like to label minors criminals (I’m in the UK) so if you like basically your classic boys will be boys. 

I was offered specialist counselling for sexual trauma but I felt so invalidated like it wasn’t a big deal (had to report originally for blackmail and my parents both told me that was the bigger issue) so I didn’t. 

Then my mental health got very out of control, I was self harming and because my parents didn’t report what had happened to the school properly they were unaware of my assault (until about 3 weeks before I finished because of rona) and I had to continue sharing a classroom with him for a further two years. 

Because of that I didn’t really process it and just shoved it in a box. 

Almost a year and a half ago I got with my boyfriend now. He has played a big role in me realising I’m finally ready to deal with my abuse in therapy. He is also completely on board and backs me 100% I couldn’t ask for anyone better. 

So about 3 months ago I told my mum everything. And the first words out of her mouth were ‘the only thing you did wrong was put yourself in that situation’. Well shit hit the fan you could say. She then tried to take it back and explain what she meant (I had a choice not to see him that day he was pressuring me over text but he had manipulated me so much I didn’t really have a choice) and had previously said that she doesn’t really want to know what happened. 

I get that it’s difficult for her to have to deal with her first child as a teenager with mental health issues (still struggle with depression and anxiety and very dramatic mood swings) She wants me to be able to talk to her but I can’t. She makes me feel so much worse. 

We are having family mediation for being a dysfunctional family anyway and this is something I’m going to bring up to my mum. 

I don’t want to make her feel bad but part of the reason I’m so bad now is because of how my parents treated me. I don’t know what to do.",09Jul2020,1

205,"A Little Background: I was diagnosed with manic depression when I was 12 years old. I was put into counseling at my middle school and during that time I refused to talk about what was wrong. I had counseling for about 4 months before I left the school. (I moved quite frequently). Around this time I started getting anxiety attacks whenever i missed more than 1 day of school. Then if I missed more it would be harder for me to return because of all the anxiety, I believe at this time is when I had social anxiety. I also missed school because I would have anxiety in the morning. This went on for years until I dropped out at 16. I went to adult school when I was 18 and graduated when I was 19. 

Then when I was 20 and in college, i was having lots of anxiety and trouble taking classes and moving around campus. I finally sought a mental health counselor at the college. She was just amazing, she helped me work through my anxiety about school and other trauma from when I was growing up. However, this was only a temporary fix as I had social anxiety and depression. My go-to that helped me with my depression and anxiety was watching anime. It really helped me stabilize my ups and downs. 

Until I was about 32 I had ups and downs, anxiety attacks, etc. But nothing very fierce or super bad. I also had no health care so I was on my own anyway. But I got healthcare and finally got to see a doctor, that was like you are bipolar (new name for manic depression) and gave me zoloft (sertraline) when I asked about taking that medication. He also gave me pain meds and let me know I have fibromyalgia. I could literally feel zoloft working when I started to get depressed, I never made it to a depressed state. After a few more visits my doctor gave me Ativan (loraxepram) 0.5mg. It worked on my anxiety and I didn't take it to often, so I always had tons left over before my next prescription.

So I was on these plus a few more medications for a few years. Then I moved back to my old state (Wisconsin) in 2015 and started going to the doctor for my meds. They told me I needed to get a psychiatrist to get my meds filled. by this time I wasn't on the pain meds anymore due to rules they had newly established and my anxiety med went from 0.5mg to 2mg twice a day. Once I got the new doctor, she put me on some other medication instead of zoloft for my bipolar. like 2 other medications. At some point I was taking 10 different medications for various reasons. Most of them for mental health issues. 

**Here is the point.** I realized about a year ago that i felt better and had LESS anxiety and depressed moments when I wasn't on medication. I found out that Ativan just made my anxiety worse. I thought I was addicted to to because I could barely go 1-2 days without it before I was having major anxiety. I couldn't sleep with out it. I started running out faster because I would take more to calm my anxiety. although the meds for my bipolar stopped my manic episodes it did nothing for my depressed state of mind. I still felt suicidal at times and was generally listless all day long. I had no motivation whatsoever. Then one day about 8 months ago, my meds started running out. I knew if I wanted a refill I would have to go to the doctor and get more. But I had started to do research as to why my anxiety was so bad. I found out that Ativan could be the cause. I realized that I felt better when I wasn't on meds and that it was supposed to be a temporary solution for a time that was really bad for me. I thought about the times when I had to go 2 weeks without Ativan and remembered that even though the first week was hard, the week after that wasn't so bad. So I stopped all meds. It was hard for the first weeks as I expected but as time went on I felt better. I still have my downs, but I've always mostly been in a neutral state with my bipolar depression. I do still get depressed but I cry it out very hard and very long and I usually feel better. I haven't had a manic episode for 8 months...at least not that I really call a manic episode. I have been motivated to read books again (I stopped reading thick aka 300-500 page books for about 8 years now). I even started reading manga (Japanese comics) again after 5 years and started watching anime a lot more. 

The medications did help me to sleep on time and not have insomnia or pain from fibromyalgia or muscle spasms but it is worth it to be off of them. Now this doesn't mean it's for everybody. Sometimes you need meds to function, but in my case it was the opposite. I do still need to take the meds for my fibromyalgia because the pain is bad and they help me to sleep at night. But I can also get sleeping pills from my doctor. It has been hard though because of COVID-19.

But basically i wanted to express how meds made things worse for me over time instead of better when it came to my mental health issues. So I know now that I should only take them short term.",09Jul2020,1

213,"Hey everyone! Hypai the DM here looking for more people to join our fledgling community for disabled warriors and other marginalized peoples looking to play dungeons and dragons with some people who may share similar issues. Be it developmental, *mental health,* or physical disabilities, we would love to have you. We have people of all backgrounds and are looking to grow into a peer lead community. Because this is an online community, I recommend you talk to your support community before joining this group. So far the community is full of wonderful people, and I plan to keep it that way, but as it is peer lead I can not guarantee professional help. Here's a little info on the group:

I have Bi-Polar and OCD, so I created this community to share an understanding space with others like me. I've struggled with mental illness for almost 9 years, and I believe I've come out all the stronger for it. I want others to see it's possible and DnD is an awesome way to open up a little bit.

I'll be DMing campaigns along with other volunteers. The hope is that people with less experience, difficulties comprehending rules, or with physical limitations (unable to roll, etc) can pair up with people willing to help these players grow into epic adventurers and possibly beyond.

I'll be looking for other people in the community to help out. I may have started the ball rolling, but my community is what has made this a great thing. Anyone with experience co-facilitating groups of people with disabilities would be amazing. I am not qualified myself so people with this kind of experience are super important to our community. I've got a few so far, so we are on the right track. Anything you can do to help, even playing a character that can keep certain groups moving in a positive direction would be welcome!

The main rule is be respectful to your fellow players! And remember, you aren't your disability. Be who you truly are! The server link will be sent individually to avoid trolls. Stay in your caves! Comment or direct message and I'll respond as timely as possible.

Thank you so much!",09Jul2020,1
214,"Hey,

I have been diagnosed with chronic depression for over a decade now. It first got diagnosed not long after my uncle died from a heroin overdose. I was in college, already doing pretty badly with a growing distance between me and my former circle of friends when this happened. I started spending entire days in bed, barely eating or drinking. I would go out at random times and walk to remote places just to be away from people. I was starting to regret my life choices and growing disillusioned with the prospects of going to university or getting a career in any of my chosen fields of study. My parents forced me to go to my GP, where I did the usual questionnaire and got   a diagnosis of depression slapped on my record. I took the meds they prescribed, but still felt like life was fucked. Dropped out of college and basically became a piece of furniture for a couple of months.

Since then I've had several jobs, been back to college and dropped out again. Went to Uni and dropped out of that too. I've lost nearly ten years of my life to intermittent lethargy, indecision and self-destruction. I've self-harmed, attempted suicide, flirted with alcoholism and had a major weed habit at one point. I've also lapsed on my medication a half-dozen times, been prescribed almost every kind of antidepressant the NHS will give you. Never felt like any of them really helped more than the side effects inconvenienced me. I am still struggling to find something I want to do in life. To figure out what kind of a person I should be. And to feel like I can handle the world consistently. 

I'm wary of self-diagnosis and I am by no means knowledgeable about mental illnesses in general, but I'm not sure I actually have depression. I haven't been sure for years. Yes, I have my bad times where my thoughts spiral out of control or I feel waves of negativity threatening to crush me. Times where I don't want to get out of bed and face the world, and all my self-care goes out of the window. But I also have times where I feel incredible. More connected, more alive, happier than everyone around me. Like I'm flying and nobody else can keep up. I get excited about things and it's too much for those around me. I get obsessed with projects and ideas and disappear into them for days at a time. It gets lonely when nobody else can follow me. Then it all goes away again and I feel like ass. Again I'm no expert but this doesn't seem typical of depression. 

Yet every time I see a GP the only possibility that's considered is that I'm not taking enough of my meds or not taking them for long enough. I have never been able to convince them that it might not be as simple as depression, a diagnosis based on a handful of questions I was asked at one point in my life many years ago.

I'm not asking to be diagnosed with something, but to my fellow sufferers in the UK:

How in the holy fuck do you convince the NHS to actually get you evaluated by somebody qualified in mental illness and not just a general practitioner working from standard questionnaires?",09Jul2020,1

Brushing my teeth, talking to my parents, paying bills, all the way to writing my dissertation has been a constant nightmare.

So there are ones I actually enjoy solving, while others, even when they are easier to deal with.

219,"Hi, 21 F. I’m not trying to self-diagnose here, just trying to figure out what the hell might be going on. 

I’ve been depressed for 12 years, and throughout I’ve had many deep depressive states which ranged from suicidal. I self harmed for most of these years. 

Around 2-3 weeks ago I began to feel a change. At first it wasn’t too bad as I assumed it was depression mood swings. Then anger came on. I was confused by this as I am a very placid person and also don’t usually show my anger if I do have it. I began to snap at my boyfriend for the most stupidest things, be agitated by what he would say, take my own spin on whatever he said to fit him into a shitty category and lash out. I’ve never ever been like this before. 

I would like to note my dad was abusive growing up and snapping at small things such as lifting a lid on a biscuit jar, my sister and I laughing (happily) at each other, not being outside or simply saying something simple that did not mean to be offensive or even spoken to him. He would immediately throw shit around the room, yell (roar) at us loudly and swear. On the other side of the coin, when he is not like this, he is the most gentle sweetest person in the world and would do anything for his daughters. It made growing up difficult and still is today, as I feel I am always walking on eggshells waiting for them to break. 

A few months ago I began to have a really bad depressive state and I basically went from 80% socialising with friends to about 5%. I am still like this now and get anxiety seeing anyone other than my boyfriend (I am staying in his room atm). 

My mood swings began to rapidly start. I would wake up fine and within an hour will cry about something for 2 hours. Then I would feel fine again and be ready to go do something, go into the city and take photographs, then I would come back and be depressed and then get angry about something. My panic attacks and depressive states have been about 4 times a day and about 2 times a day I will feel fine on average. I also slammed my fist into the wall because an Uber eats order didn’t deliver and then began to have a breakdown and anger which caused me to scratch myself with my nails on my wrist, I don’t even know why I did it. I was just so angry and upset. 

I feel as if I don’t have emotions but simply just feel anxiety, depression and anger. I feel like I’m dealing with different versions of myself each day and it’s exhausting. 

I have just spent the night being happy and then crying my eyeballs at being angry at my boyfriend, being angry at myself and talking about how I believe none of my friends like me and they are all just using me. I KNOW that this isn’t true but for some reason even right now I can’t shake the feeling that they don’t like me and aren’t my real friends. I seem to have this fixation on seeing the ‘reality’ of people as I just called it in my state to my bf, which means that all people are awful and use each other out of convenience. 

I am scared of myself because I’ve never felt this before to this extent and I have never had this many mood swings. I have had depression for so long I find it hard to believe it could be depression, as I’ve never experienced this before. 

I am really scared. I don’t want to be like this.

232,"I (20M) grew up feeling completely isolated and alone, even with a large family. Everyone kinda just fended for themselves, the only real loving physical contact I would get was my mom hugging me after mentally abusing and manipulating me for an hour. I hit one point where I realized I had not been purposefully touched by someone in over a month, no one really cared enough to want to. people at school would talk to me if they had nothing better to do but as soon as anything else came up I was left alone again. In my life I've had probably only 3 people I could call a close friend, and 2 of them I only met in the last 2 years. My whole life I've been emotionally isolated, slowly dying inside. I knew no one really cared, and no one was going to help. I don't think my whole life I've ever gone more than a couple days without wanting to end it all. 

I've spent my time in a mental institute, they slapped on a broad diagnosis (""general mood disorder"") and sent me back to my mother who's solution for anything was more medication. I was taking 1800MG daily by the time I was 15, multiple medications that when I told the doctor I got myself once I turned 18, she said should never be used on a child, especially at that dose. I was commiting nearly every day, eventually she told the school to stop sending me home for it. When I hit 18 I got myself a different doctor and went down to 10MG of medication a day, then to none, and my mental state has actually improved, so my entire immune system has been wrecked for completely nothing. This also means I probably don't even have ""general mood disorder"" and something else is screwed up about me.

My Dad moved us all to a new state when I had just hit 19,I was still in school then, I actually had to drop out and pack my entire family and the house up for the move. My mother wasn't going to be able to do it and my Dad was working up until the day we had to move, so it was ""all up to me"". I tried to make the best of it, have a better life here. These last 2 years I've tried opening up and made a few amazing friends, and they supported me and while I still felt alone they gave me the strength to keep going. I got myself a car, a job, an apartment away from my family, and I met a wonderful woman who helped me open up and feel ok about my life and myself. Things had started to look up, I was happy for once.

Then our relationship went real South and we split. Soon after I lost my job. As of right now I'm praying that I can get a new job or unemployment before I lose my apartment and car. While all the physical things I've lost/will soon lose has hurt me, what's killing me is what I lost when I lost my relationship. Even with all the pain that caused us to break up, she somehow always knew when I was sad. She would hold me when I was hurting, help me work through my pain. We would just lie on the bed and hold eachother at night, and it was perfect, if only for that moment it was perfect. She had a lot of pains too and I helped her, so it wasn't just me sucking the soul out of the relationship by being sad.

Now it's all over and I'm laying in my bed alone, and all I want is for someone to hold my hand. I'm so tired of being alone. I had just became used to opening up, to letting someone see me as the person I am, all my screwed up parts. Now I am painfully aware of how dark my apartment is, how quiet it is, how empty it is. I was used to this, but I opened up and now it hurts more than it did before.

One of the friends I made in the new state has drifted away a bit because her life is moving in a different direction but the other one has stood by me through all of this and she is the only reason I'm still alive right now. I don't want to admit how many times these last few weeks I've wanted to ask her to just hug me and tell me it's going to be ok, but she's not a very touchy girl and I know even though we're close enough, to the point that she's told everyone from her family to the guy she's seeing that I'm her best friend and I'm gonna be around so they should get used to me, she wouldn't be comfortable with it just because she's uncomfortable being touched by most people.

I honestly don't know what I'm doing. I'm taking it day by day, praying for something good and getting mediocre at best. I had a 48 hour period where I couldn't really get out of bed, I just shuffled from food to empty sheets. I've realized I'm only living for those around me right now, because I'm a support for my 2 friends and my younger siblings who are stuck in the situation I managed to escape. I'm fully aware if they didn't still need me I would have ended it already. I'm doing my best to keep moving and hoping better days will come, but I'm not sure how long I can wait.",09Jul2020,1
233,"Hubby and I have been married for 26 years today, and we went to a local buffet to eat, then out for ice cream. We had a chauffeur (our eldest daughter) and it was just nice to be out and about. It is hot as balls out there though. Ugh. It is starting to storm now too, which hopefully will cool it off. My appetite seems to be slipping, though, and I am getting concerned. I don't know if it is mostly because of the heat and humidity, or because I am slipping back into my ED ways. I did look at myself the other day after my shower and cringed because of how fat I have gotten. I mean I am a chunky monkey right now...and I am longing for those bones sticking out like they were when I was incarcerated (I was really skinny). Can someone just give me some inspiration to help me not fall back into my ED again? I love to eat, but I am afraid to at this point. Even at the restaurant, I had very little and it was mostly fruit. I didn't finish my ice cream. :(

I try to explain it to my psychs but its like i cant, so they cant help me. I have no motivation at all, like not just a lack, but total apathy.

I took the steps to delete Instagram and got my boyfriend to block me on his. Instagram is very toxic for me so it just had to go. I never really used it in the first place however I was really only using it to see what girls he would follow. It is wrong but I did it so I just needed it done.

242,"Hi all. Not sure where to go with this, so here goes:

About a decade ago, my younger brother (18 at the time) was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He’d already been drinking heavily and dabbling in cocaine and shrooms. Ten years and gradual escalation have led to him using heroin and meth. He was diagnosed right after high school, and coming from a codependent family, was never given consequences or follow through. My parents battled with him stealing money and selling others personal belongings, but ultimately he’s always gotten his way. When I left home and got married to my s/o my pink goggles fell off and I realized how messed up my once “normal” family had become. Within the last year my parents have given up and now allow open heroin and meth use in their house because they’re scared of kicking my brother out, knowing he isn’t capable of taking care of himself. His body is shutting down (recent hospital visits and ICU stays) and he claims he doesn’t care if he dies. My mother (also with a boatload of her own issues) is the main facilitator for everything that goes down. I’m devastated because I now realize I can never bring my two children to that house, and they will not have a relationship with their grandparents. I rarely see them, anymore, but I guess I’m writing this to see if anyone else has gone through anything similar. I don’t want to “cut off all ties” but I also can’t bare to see my mother anymore knowing what she’s doing. She often lies to other family members to hide that fact she buys my brother hard drugs. I still have decent phone relationship with my dad, but as things have taken a turn for the worse that becomes strained too. He has a level head and recognizes what’s happening is wrong, but ultimately his loyalties are to my mom, and he’s also normalized a lot of what goes down over the years.

Any suggestions? Thank you for reading. Writing it out makes me feel like an insane person for even considering a relationship with these people, but I seem to be having a hard time “hurting them” by making stance (even though I rarely see them anyway). I just don’t know what to do.",09Jul2020,1
243,"I recently posted on the sub about considering therapy, and after the support and help I received and honestly a lt of thinking, I've decided that after the UK lockdown is completely lifted and I can visit a therapist in person I will seek out professional help (if I already can visit therapists in the UK in person then I would be grateful to know how this is done). 

So this brings me onto my current problem. If you go through my comments, and please feel free, you can see me flip flop constantly from nice to nasty. Again, I posted on the sub earlier about an almost compulsive desire to start arguments, which I found was to vent frustration and anger in a way that wasn't destructive. I know it is wrong, which is why I don't like doing it, but I can't find any other way aside from violence to vent this. 

It comes in waves, which start with positivity, to then sarcasm and scathing, to anger and hatred, to then seeking help and writing on the sub, which brings positivity back. I want to effectively cut out the anger and hate and reduce the sarcasm and scathing, but I'm not sure how without therapy.

248,"Hello everyone, hope you all are doing okay today. So I had to go to the dentist today after months without going lol and coming back home my bus went by and stopped really close to my school. You can see it from the bus window. This sounds like 0 problem for most of people, but, it it was a big deal for me! 

Just to give you some background, I dropped out of school this February just because my class was toxic AF. Really toxic. Maybe some of you have experienced that. Basically, I was tired and anxious every morning after waking up just thinking about going to school and being in a class with people I don't want to talk to (except two people that were the only nice and not toxic ones) for 6,7 hours a day. I would eat in the school's Bathrooms because I didn't want to be around those rude classmates of mine. I would cry just thinking about going to sleep and start it all over again the next morning. A lot of things happened to make me feel that way, but it is kinda long (nothing related to bullying thankfully, but the class vibe was not good and you could basically breath that, if you know what I mean). Either way, when I left school I could see a progress on my mental health even from day one. In a few weeks, I would not cry about school or anything similar so I thought all was already okay in my mind. Well lol I was wrong. As I said, when I was going by my school I literally felt that my stomach was hurting (it happens when I'm nervous, it's like a weird belly ache) and that's when I realized that I'm still scared of school and that feeling will not go away unless I go to therapy and I can start to see school not as a threat but as what it is, a school. Just think about it, you spend years and years studying. School, university... You will have to go through all those places in your life. So I can't be scared about a public learning place.

Well, just wanted to rant it out lol I'm okay now, the bus kept going and minutes later that belly ache went away. It's just that seeing the school after months without putting a feet near that area was a big thing for me. At least this made me realize that it's serious and that I will probably need some help with it because I can't imagine how I would feel if now I had to get inside a class again. It would be hard, I already know it.

After awhile I talked to him a few months later and I was having rapid mood swings going from elated and almost feeling out of body to crashing mood swings. We tried lots of medication and eventually he changed the diagnosis to Cyclthymia.

I talked to a doctor about the new diagnosis and they said that they would still consider it depression and treated it as such. From there I just ignored it all and quit all meds (bad idea)

I talked to the therapist again and he listened to me and said he fears it may be Bipolqr as my mood swings were getting worse (including paranoia, self harm, and huge bursts of energy)

Hi, me again, back on the throwaway account... 

I posted here about a month back or so about my own struggles with depression and anxiety and (maybe not as poignantly) how my wife’s OCPD has kind of played into it.  I’m not here to vent more so as I’m here to seek answers.  We’ve had some pretty bumpy roads so far in our marriage (about 2 months in now) but it seems as if the good parts of our marriage are getting better... but the bad is getting worse I feel.  She doesn’t want to sit down and discuss issues; civil discourse and different opinions are seen as being stubborn, complaints, being mean, etc.  I’m working with my therapist right now on healthy ways to be more assertive but any time I try and stand up for my needs, wants, or desires, she takes it as me either complaining, being stubborn... you get the point.  We can’t have rational discussions without her personalizing them and getting extremely emotional.  I’m not innocent myself, but when you wake me up from a dead sleep at 11:00 at night when I have to be up for work at 4:00 in the morning to interrogate me as to why I’m sleeping so well when she was upset (a loose example)... I’m not going to exude sunshine and unicorn farts.  

I feel like her “symptoms” (unsure of technical term) from her OCPD are worsening and I feel that she isn’t even aware of it.  It seems that she feels all the faults in our relationship rest on me and I’m the sorry soul who has to shoulder every misstep.  For context, I’m currently in online counseling through a web service (shout-out Rat King Theo Von for the discount code Gang Gang), meeting with a friend from our church who is in school for Biblical counseling, one of the pastors from our church, as well as occasionally using close friends and family to vent... She on the other hand has said before that she didn’t think we needed couples counseling, she didn’t need therapy (for issues unrelated to OCPD), and has expressed sincere disdain that I haven’t been “fixed” yet through my own counseling.   

I guess this is really a roundabout way of asking... what do I do?  How do I get her help?  How do I get US help?  I’m honestly afraid that if our relationship continues on this trajectory then eventually we’ll reach a climax and one of us will end up miserable (which in turn would lead the other to eventually feel miserable).  I know given the nature of her diagnosis, it’s extremely difficult and unhelpful to be blunt about it (I.e. remind her of her disorder and flip the blame to her... although that wouldn’t be my intention).  How do I lovingly express to her that I think she needs to look back into therapy (she stopped going shortly after we started dating: about 2 years ago).  

I feel I’m in a no win scenario; stuck between a very big rock and a rather dense hard place and I don’t know what to do.  Any response, any advice, any words would be helpful.  

Thanks y’all",09Jul2020,1

This  involves binge-eating a great sum of food, in a short amount of time, and then vomiting or using laxatives to expel  the food. The second is a non purging type. This usually involves  extreme and excessive exercise, diet and fasting. Either type of bulimia  can impact both the physical and the mental health of an adolescent in such a negative way. 

Often, the reasoning for the eating disorder is to avoid gaining weight or maintaining current body shape. Because of the negative stigma associated with this eating disorder, the adolescent may be reluctant to ask for help. **Do you suspect your child has an eating disorder? Are you seeking ways to help your child overcome this disorder? How is this impacting you? Please let us know!**",09Jul2020,1
263,"As the title says, my friend has been diagnosed with a Mental illness not too long ago by a Friends wife who is a counselor last year, unfortunately, it is getting worse and worse, to the point where the first thing out of his mouth is some conspiracy Theory when you meet him, another friend has given him Money and made some appointments for him, but he refused to go, I do not know what do at this point this is a new experience for me and you can only lead a horse to water so any help would be greatly appreciated since so far it has all been a waste of money and time.  
I do not want to release too much personal information outside of him being in his 40's and living in California USA if that helps.",09Jul2020,2
264,"Hi! I know you guys prob aren't psychiatrists or anything so I'm not asking for a diagnoses or anything, I would just love to know what yall think I might have so I can ask a professional and have a clue what might be wrong. I have had a lot of professional help but because I suck at talking no one really knew.... but oke here we go. I am horrible at feelings, I have just no idea... I know when I feel good and when I dont but that's about it. I feel completely dissociate from the world and life. The only thing that works for me is to just BE. Living one second at a time is the only way I can deal with life. I have been suicidal, but I have that under control. I do still struggle with self harm especially because I'm super impulsive (and addicted but ok🥴) I have some trauma and deal with it horribly. The only thing that's necessary to make me upset is to talk with a different tone. When you are angry with me, I will completely dissociate. If you keep going after I dissociated I will explode. I am very unstable. I can be angry with you one second and laugh with you the other. I dont trust or talk with people. When I do trust someone I will get very attached to you. Have struggled in the past with severe depression, anxiety, eating issues and some more I dont remember. Luckily I am doing a lot better with those things but I just know something else is wrong. I prob forgot something bit that's ok. Thank you for reading I'm looking forward to reading your opinions!",09Jul2020,1
266,"Sorry if this is full of shitty humor.

My mother had knee surgery today and is now dependent on me. I am a shitty person to depend on.

I don’t know what to do when it comes to empathy. I’m just bad at it and have a “do it yourself” attitude. 

Not gonna lie, my mother and I have Azula/Ursa vibes (avatar yeahhh). She’s horrified at my lack of empathy (I just don’t understand it and I feel like shit bc of that) and I think she’s a bleeding heart.

I just wish I could understand empathy and help people, but all I can think right now is how I can get out of this and continue on with my life as normal. I’m needed and all I want to do is run away and say “take care of yourself or find someone else”.

This is probably coming off as so edgy, and I apologize. I hate that I can’t understand this. I don’t know if it’s just a symptom of one of mental illnesses or if I’m just a shitty person.

I guess it’s good that I hate myself for being so unempathetic (is that a word). I wish there was a book I could read and figure out what I’m doing wrong.

I am sorry if this is coming off really weird, having a panic attack in the bathroom and that makes me rant. I hope y’all are having a better day.",09Jul2020,1
267,"Back when I was in high school which was over 7 years ago, I got bullied a lot both verbal and physical I feel like I haven't got completely over it, I feel like people are mocking me and the bullying will start again even though they are joking, I have a lot of suppressed anger that I take out on others if I feel like they're mocking me, my self esteem is so bad since it happened I just wanna trust people again and have more self confidence",09Jul2020,2
268,"TW // 

I hope this is the right subreddit to post this to. 
So, bit of background information:
My home life is pretty rough, divorce, my dad is transphobic and has been physically and verbally abusive, and I have had to drop out of college to start saving for when I get kicked out. 

I mention this because this is the first thing GP’s ask me, and then they proceed to mark up all my mental health issues to that, and I’ve been told two times by different practitioners that my issues are purely environmental and when I move out I’ll be fine. Baring in mind my first appointment about my mental health issues was when I was 15, and I made it clear to them that there was no way to leave my dads house. 

I do my best to try and tell them that despite my difficulties at home, I feel anxious, depressed and have rapid intense mood swings regardless of what’s happening at home. I need advice on what to do to be taken seriously because I need help, it takes a lot out of me to ask just to be told the same thing over and over. 

Thank you, I hope you have a great day",09Jul2020,1
269,"I, a US male, started therapy and one thing my therapist ask is what emotion I'm feeling. It's often hard for me to describe it besides positive or negative emotions. It's not that I only feel emotions this way, but it's difficult to express them in other ways. Does anyone have any ideas that may help better express the emotions I feel?

Also, I find myself having difficulty being vulnerable besides with myself and my therapist. I feel it's hurting my ability to form new and deeper relationships. It's not that I don't want to, but rather that I feel I can't. I'm a large guy and at first I appear like a macho guy. However, I'm quite sensitive and would like to be able to show vulnerability. I want to be able to form these deeper connections but I almost feel embarrassed to show emotion. I don't feel embarrassed to have these emotions but I feel as I can't express them.",09Jul2020,1

271,"We are from Oklahoma, he is a 14 year old. We had a normal appointment today for a check up, he marked that he had suicidal thoughts and made a meager attempt in the past (about a year ago). I did not know about the attempt and just found out today. A psychiatrist came in to evaluate and said she wasn’t sure if she wanted to admit or do outpatient. She talked to someone and went with ‘volunteer admit’. We were transferred downstairs (to ER). I have done some research while waiting and I feel the best bet would be outpatient. It seems inpatient makes things worse than what they were. I tried talking to the ER doctor and asked for an against medical advice discharge. They will not allow it and we are here until morning for when they can transfer him to a facility. 

Can they do this?
What will he experience while there?

273,"I really want to talk to people and make new friends, but every time someone invades my personal ‘bubble’ (for lack of a better word) or even talks to me sometimes, I feel like I’m gonna explode or something. Then It just sorta feels like everything goes kinda hazy...? 

Even family members. Like somebody would try to go in for a hug or would slightly graze past me and I feel like I’m gonna cry for no reason. It makes me feel really bad because I feel like an a-hole when I go out of my way to try to socialize with some people, and I can’t pay attention to what they’re saying because it feels like I’m pulling teeth.

Not really sure wether to flag this as a vent or a question, honestly. I just wanted to know if other people feel the same way.",09Jul2020,1
274,"I was misdiagnosed with schizophrenia and the doctor made me took invega sustenna. Few days later, I felt emotionally numb, anhedonia, dissociation, social withdrawal, avolition, apathy, amotivation, etc. My brain feels tired and I have no energy and motivation to do anything. I am afraid that my brain is permanently altered this way and that I would have to live like this forever. Is this a common experience for people who take antipsychotics? Do you recover once you are off from the antipsychotics? 

Thanks.",09Jul2020,1
275,"A few months ago I made the decision to try medication. I'd been on an SSRI as a kid that I did not have a good experience with and had been pretty afraid of meds ever since. But now, 10 years later, I wanted to give it another shot. I'd been doing therapy and we got to a point where there was not much to talk about. That was because things were generally going well and when they couldn't, my therapist felt I really had the skills to process and cope in a healthy way. But despite that, something felt... off. And it didn't feel like something therapy alone could fix. So I sought out meds.

Since then, I have been put on a variety of medications, none of them really helping. First my psychiatrist threw antipsychotics and gabapentin at me. I was allergic to one antipsychotic and another made me terribly emotionally unstable. The gabapentin turned me into an idiot because it affected my memory so badly. 

Then we switched to hydroxyzine. It affects my memory in the same way that gabapentin does but not as severely, but it also turns me into a lazy blob, which makes me miserable because I like to be very active and involved in various hobbies. So she lowered the dose and threw in a different anti-anxiety med. 

She's been very responsive to my concerns and willing to keep adjusting things and trying new meds. But I just cant help but feel very frustrated with this process and like I regret doing this all in the first place. It feels like she's just throwing medication at me and each med makes my life worse instead of better. 

Idk, I'm just about ready to throw in the towel. My original symptoms were more tolerable than this stress.",09Jul2020,1
276,"Hello, I am doing some research for a team project to improve the mental health resources at college so I would appreciate hearing your thoughts.

1. Do you think it is important for a college to offer mental health services?

2. If you are in college, how easy is it to get mental health help from your colleges normally and also during COVID-19?

3. Would you prefer anonymous online therapy with a therapist or would you prefer person-to-person?

4. Would you like to help us on our project?(I'll tell you more specifics if you say yes)",09Jul2020,1
278,"Hi reddit,Im a 16 year old girl.This has been going on for a long time.My feelings was always up and down(even my mom says my feelings and emotions are unpredictable)but she does nothing about it.I opened up to her about me wanting to check if im mentally stable or not(go to a psychiatrist to check if im fully okay) but she always says that ""Are you not grateful?"",telling me to think about how many people are living worse lives than me.But does that ever has To do anything about my mental health?

All my life,i lived with a useless dad who never takes care of the family(since im muslim,dads can marry two women.he marries two but doesnt even give a shit about my family)
Adding to that,i have a brother that already has a mental illness which makes him throw tantrums quickly(and ocd)He traumatized me once because he threw off at me,he screamed at me loudly.Right now i cant even hear anyone yelling or ill cry very quickly,remembering what happened to me around 10 years ago

I was always trying to be the best for the family.i kept my grades up.Always helped my mom since my big brother never did anything to help.At some point i will break down thinking about all of these problems im going through.but i tried to stay strong

This led me to hide my feelings very often.i would cry in the bathroom,cry when im alone.Because sometimes i cry very suddenly for no reason.a few minutes later i get joyful all of a sudden.My ex told me that he saw me crying because of my dad and suddenly becoming a bright sunshine which led him to think im bipolar.

I dont know what to do.I just harmed myself recently,i have a few cuts on my arm.Should i tell my mom about it?if i tell her she would cancel me out.She would say its temporary.She would say im not grateful.is there an alternative way i can deal with my mental health?im stuck.i dont know what to do",09Jul2020,1

280,"Hello everyone, i’m hoping some of you could give me some advice on my (m24) little brother (m12). 

I just got off the phone with my mom and she mentioned that my youngest brother (my other brother is m21) has been sleeping all day and not much else. She noticed he’s seemed really sad and not wanting to do anything, even the things he used to really enjoy. She also mentioned his friends aren’t really texting him back. This upsets me and I want to help him but i’m not sure how. It seems like depression but I’m not sure how to navigate this since he’s only 12.

I mentioned to my mom that I think it would be good for him to see a therapist over Zoom or online somehow. I also want to make a point about calling him and facetiming him more often. 

I know that’s not a ton of info, but I really want to help him and any advice would be great. Ask any questions in the chat, I can give more detailed information if needed.",09Jul2020,1
282,"Hello, I (F15) have been struggling for awhile with not being able to focus and procrastinating a lot. I find that when I start things well before they need to be done I do them fine and quickly and often enjoy them, but as deadlines get closer I start to really stress out to the point where I can't focus enough to finish the task which leads to me procrastinating. I hadn't been having an issues in the last two weeks which I was really happy about and I was hoping the issue would stay away until I can start actually dealing with it at my first therapy appointment which is in 2 weeks. The issue though is that now I'm feeling overwhelmed and too-stressed-to-focus again because of a summer school assignment that was way harder than expected. I barely have anything left (I just need to find 2 more linguistic anthropologists to research) but after this I need to clean my room because I have what I call a ""depression pile"" of clothes in the corner that my dad wants me to clean before I go to my mom's tomorrow.

283,"Man tbh I'm pretty loathe to post shit like this anymore but man idek.   
Like.. I'm living in a super fucked up abusive household rn.   
The other day one of my parents went off the deep end because the dog was tryna dig into my bin and knocked it over.   
This spiralled because I didn't have my patience to keep my cool that day.   
She revealed that she/someone has been stalking my social media and sc'd me venting about one horrible night last year when I was worried she'd try to kill me tbh.   
And this isn't an unwarranted fear, there have been events over the years that are real threats and she has tried some fucked up shit.   


Now I'm stuck here, we're in quarantine in Wales still pretty much and it's just a nightmare.   
I tried to kill myself another time and dropped out of uni. Now I work in a call centre and to be honest I'm just gagging to get fucked up.   
I'm trying to stop drinking so I don't end up like my dad. Violent, sad and dependent.   
I've overcome a weed addiction/dependency that almost rendered me homeless a year and a half ago.   


Yet now I'm at the point where I just don't really care anymore. I'm cutting regularly and have the same hunger to level it up that I used to have a few years ago when I was real bad.   
I want to fuck myself up. I need sharper blades, I need to get out my tatt needs, I need to burn shit into myself. I just need to let it all out on myself.   


More worryingly I need to drink, I need to do anything someone hands me and I need to fight.   
This has gotten me into a lot of problems, I've had full-blown psychosis before and it was really, really bad.   
Like london MET police coming to my house bad, because of something I posted when I was deep in a truly fucked up psychotic episode.   
Right now I have no escape, nowhere to go, I don't make enough to rent on my own. 

I'm cutting myself to bits again and really it's just not enough. It's nowhere near enough. I need blood, everywhere. Not just some small trickles. I just don't know how to express it.   
I've started to hear voices again and I'm not super sure what to do, I can't get out of here rn and it's awful. I hear friends, family, customers on the phone, all insulting me under their breath and rn I'm still cognisant enough to know it's just the voices. But I also am so so so scared of where this has gone in the past.   


I am so trapped. I am so pinned down. I am so, so so lost.   


I've booked some time off and I'm trying to get out to the next biggest city over. I really need to see my mates, and a lot of my family of friends lives there. I want to go over there, take 4 days, drink all day, smoke all day, and spend some good quality time just hugging the shit out of them and crying a lot.   


Now my bestie in the whole world, my sister from another mister has said she's got a crush on a mate. I love him so so much too, but shit has been weird between us. He's had weird stuff going on, and to make it worse I've been falling off the deep end again.   
Idk where I can go from here. I really don't need to be hot footing around a crush birthed from them recently splitting with a long time partner, another mutual friend. Idk. I just need a hug. But it's also painfully clear that shit is getting bad for me and I'm either going to end up homeless, or fucked. Idk what do, I just cannot for the life of me think of what to do.",09Jul2020,1
