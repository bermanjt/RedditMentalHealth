1,"For years I've been insecure about my diagnosis on the autism spectrum with aspergers, not because I feel different, but because of the stigma towards autism and the people who have it. I've always noticed a stigma that people with autism are ""neckbeards"" or ""creepy"" and every time I see that, I feel depressed and ashamed of myself even though I can't change that I'm autistic. I know that nobody here is a therapist, but I'd like to hear if anyone has any advice on how to accept my diagnosis? 

I feel like my first steps to feeling better about myself would be reaching out to others and learning how to accept that I can't change the way I was born.",07Jun2020,1
2,"For a few years now it feels like my life has sort of just been moving through the motions and I'm not really in control like someone else is playing my life like a third person video game. It feels like I'm never really paying full attention to things and always sort of in a haze, like when I'm biking or working I get moments where I go ""oh right, I'm biking right now I better concentrate"". Does this resonate with anyone else? Honestly I thought the fox would be to drink more coffee cuz it feels like I'm sleep deprived but that didn't fix it. Any ideas?",07Jun2020,1
3,"I was doing fine at the start of everything, working from home, taking up old hobbies as well as new, hanging w my family. Then all of a sudden something stupid triggered me and I had a meltdown. I was diagnosed with PTSD, GAD, and severe depression as well as several phobias years ago. Till the quarantine started I was in a good place and had gone to only having therapy sessions as needed. I take my depression meds daily and had emergency anxiety meds in case of panic attacks. My career is good, relationships good, I was losing weight. The instant the meltdown happened I reached out to my boss, the other director of the shelter I work at, my therapist, and family. Everyone has been great. My boss gave me a week off paid without deducting from my PTO and told me to let him know if I need anything. I just had a meds eval with my doctor on Thursday and with the recommendation from my therapist she agrees I need daily anxiety meds along with my emergency ones. I have all the support of coworkers, volunteers, and friends and family but none of my outlets or behavioral therapy is getting me out of this funk. I'm constantly on the verge of tears and I don't know what to do anymore. Just needed an outlet to vent. I shutdown FB when this started so I don't have to see constant stressful news.",07Jun2020,1

5,"So, i used to do Irish dancing from the age of 7 to 11 and I used to love performing in front of crowds and learning choreographing.

But im now 20, and I cant even do a hand movement from the choreography (im trying to learn Kpop) but I end up getting into my own head too much and start hating myself.

People say that practice is the only way. Which is obvious. But how can I if the very action freams me out enough to stop me.

Any advice?",07Jun2020,1
6,"My trauma is so surreal it almost feels fake, I don't want to believe it was there.  For years I used to try to pretend it was all false memories in order to fit the narrative of a normal life.  As a child I used to imagine all of it was from a past life.  It feels like someone else's memories.  I don't feel anything like myself when I look at myself in those memories.  I can't recognize any part of my personhood.  I wish I was just delusional like my mom gaslighted me to believe I was.  It hurts too much to believe it all happened.",07Jun2020,1
7,"(i wouldn’t really consider this trauma, but trauma kinda sums up how it affects me)

i (M15) have divorced parents, but the main reason they got divorced was my dad’s alcoholism and some actions he took in relation to it.

growing up, he would miss my sports meets, concerts, etc because of losing his license. during the divorce, i was used as a “spy” for my mother to look over his shoulder and hunt for beer cans when he was living in our basement. i’ve spent hours in police stations because he skipped court dates in relation to duis and was pulled over with us in the car.

because of this, i am wary with alcohol. i will not drink any (even if it’s just my sibling or mother offering me a sip of wine). this obviously does not cause issues, it’s even healthier.

BUT, i get extremely wary when friends of mine drink. obviously my friends are not legal, but i understand that, ya know, it’s high school. most of the time, i end up slightly freaking out at them and snapping. 

i know i can control people, so i need a way to manage this wariness. so yeah, lemme know if y’all have any ideas.",07Jun2020,1
8,"I am almost positive I have some sort of disability and I want to get checked just for some reassurance. My dad is very narcissistic and everyone in my family treats me like I have the mental capacity of a 10 year old and I kind of just go along with it because I feel like it makes them feel better about themselves so I haven't really minded it too much. I'm 19 now and I have a feeling that all of my dad's manipulation and my families degrading words have actually caused something in my head. The problem is that I have sometimes sarcastically and seriously mentioned mental health and in both cases everyone in my family brushed it off like it was nothing. So idk if they would even believe me if I got diagnosed with something. Any ideas on what I should do, also I'm sorry if I went on for to long I just had to get it off my chest and clear my head somewhere.",07Jun2020,1
9,"This may seem less serious than other issues on here but I’ve been really struggling with my mental health since quarantine started. I feel guilty for it because I know there’s a lot worse going on in the world but I just feel so unmotivated and hopeless?
My final year of uni was cut short because of the pandemic and while I’ve been struggling with anxiety for a while, recently it’s turned more into feelings of “there’s no point in anything” and I just don’t really know what to do with my life because finding a job just becoming even harder. This results in me constantly wishing I could go back in time (which obviously isn’t going to happen) instead of focusing on how to make the present/future better. 
Was just wondering if anyone had any suggestions on what I could do to combat these feelings?",07Jun2020,1

Many people have 1or2 people they talk to about their problems and help eachother. But i have none. It's so difficult. 
I may have difficulties talking to people because of my fear of them backstabbing me or just leaving me. When people talk behind my back i can't stop thinking about it.

13,The last 5 months were not that great for me... I have an upcoming exam in 5 days that is very important and I feel totaly not prepared .I hope that I will get a 8.5/10 but the chances are pretty low ... Over that My social life has not been great either .... I didnt talk to anyone except my parents that come very late from work. I spend all of my days learning but failing .... I have no friends. No one wants to talk to me. And to put salt on the wound 3 months ago I got rejected by my only crush this year . I am in a very low point rn and feel bad the moment I wake up. I dont know how to deal with this .... Last year was great for me I got a gf and was happy most of my year and then around june she broke up with me and that was the moment my life went downhill from . From june to today no one opens up conversations with me . No one wants to talk with me. I feel lonley and sad. This year was really bad. I got bullied less than last year but I still fell like shit when I try to talk to my classmates. The only thing that is making me happy is my pasion. Wich I dont often do it rn because of my exam wich is on my mind everyday. If i dont get over 8.5 I will fail. And  my level rn is 7 at maths and 8 at my contry's language. I FEEL LIKE SHIT . I HATE THE PLACE WHERE MY LIFE IS RIGHT NOW. And I dont know how to escape the situation that Im in right now. I JUST WANT TO GO BACK..... Its 4am and I dont want to sleep because if I wake up then I got to do the same thing that I did for the last 5 months. Everyday feels the same .. I feel like a robot . Wake up . Learn . Eat . Sleep. I have no one to talk to so I can tell how I feel. My parents cant talk with me much because they arive at 8-10 pm. Even if quarantine didnt exist I still would not be able to talk with anyone.,07Jun2020,1
14,"I posted this to r/anger already but I think it might be applicable here more so than there. 

 

I feel like an evil jerk. I don't know why but whenever I feel someone has invaded my space (like they entered my apartment and we had a confrontation) I get so furious I start lashing out violently over stupid things. My roomba bumped into my leg a full day after someone I know and I had a disagreement I kicked it across the room like some kind of psycho (and bruised my foot, ow). I kind of go into this point where I'm super anxious but relatively normal, and then every little thing that happens is the 'last straw' and it's almost like I can't control my own body. It's scary, because what if I hurt someone I care about? I had one incident where one of my cats got into a very important package and was chewing on it and I had this awful impulse to throw her or do something awful. I feel like it's getting worse. I don't have fun hurting people or things, I dont get off on torturing animals or anything. It's just when I'm on this wire-thin string of composure I feel like something might happen. I know this has been going on for a long time- I've seriously hurt one of my sisters when we were younger but I hadn''t really connected it to this anger until I gained some self awareness on it. I think I'm either sick in the head or an awful person.

This may or may not be related, but I also have a huge issue with ownership. That is to say, insecurity over what is 'mine' and what isn't. I can't buy things used, and when my parents got me a dog when I was younger, they named her for me and it always, always peeved me. I didn't want anything to do with her. (Not a huge deal since the dog liked my mom more than me). I just didn't feel like it was 'mine. And now, some guy I have an issue with comes to my apartment and confronts me in my 'safe space' and now I'm going up the wall with trying to make it feel safe again.

My parents never let me go to therapy or see a psychiatrist (they're scientologists), which maybe is what I need. I don't know whats wrong with me, and I need to do something about it soon but I don't know what. Please don't yell at me, I don't know what to do and I'm freaked out. I'm suspecting anxiety and maybe even bi-polar. But I don't know anything about it since my parents wouldn't let me receive medical help and actively prevented me from learning about it.

I'm somewhat suicidal. I haven't made any attempts, but the temptation is strong. The only reason I haven't made an attempt is that my mother's friend's son shot himself with a shotgun and I know that if I killed myself or attempted to she'd lose it and may even hurt herself. Even so, I still feel the urge on an off-day basis; although I've never self-harmed. I don't know the reason why, but I'm afraid of letting my parents see any evidence since they would tell me just to go back to the Org. They think I'm making everything up.

I also have a very hard time concentrating and I have pretty frequent memory loss. Sometimes I sleep for 16 hours a day, sometimes missing important things due to it. Sometimes I do manage to feel okay, and I get a lot done but it never lasts very long and is pretty few and far between. I can't remember what people say after they tell me either.",07Jun2020,1
15,"I know this problem im having might not be a big deal to some of you, but it literally made me cry and it's a big deal to me, at least right now. I also know we aren't supposed to be having parties right now but we're teenagers and my friends were going to have one whether I came or not (in this case I wasn't even invited) I just want to vent because I feel so betrayed and I'm realizing that I was probably never wanted in the friend group in the first place. It's not that they think I don't want to go, they know I have depression and I told them that at the last party i actually felt really happy, part of the reason this is such a big deal to me. I even told the person organizing the party that I want to go multiple times, and then they just went and had the party without me even knowing. It's not that they wanted to keep it small, it was the biggest party they've had yet, the only possible reasons left to why I wasn't invited is probably because im just that unwanted, or they forgot about me, but that's not much better. I don't know why I'm that unwanted, I try to be nice to everyone and I thought that these people were my friends, but I guess not. I was so excited for this party, i even got alcohol to bring and share with people, and then I find out that the party already happened last night and I wasn't even aware of it. I've been trying to improve myself lately; doing my homework, showering every day, keeping my room clean, things to help with my depression, and it actually had been working. But now I feel it's all pointless if I have no friends and nobody cares about me.


Sorry for the wall of text and horrible formatting, just wanted to vent.

17,"I just deleted facebook and messenger off my phone because I can't handle everyone hating each other. I don't want to delve into that anymore, though. Suffice it to say this should be good for my mental health.

However, it has had the unintended side effect of now I don't have my support network. I had a lot of friends who posted memes, some uplifting, some dark humor, and a lot that were mental health related. Basically I had some friends who made me laugh and now I don't get those laughs unless I go to a computer, which with a 7 month old isn't going to happen often. 

Any suggestions on ways to keep my mind occupied or to divert spirals etc.? I'll admit that scrolling without really reading was cathartic sometimes and I haven't figured out a safe way to do the same thing on Reddit yet. 

I know it's an impossible situation I'm in, but Facebook was literally making me suicidal on a daily basis and now I'm just suicidal from being so disconnected. It's dumb and I'm probably more venting than looking for solutions, but if you have anything for me please let me know!",07Jun2020,1
18,"So I’ll start from the beginning I guess. August of 2019 I started to get really depressed and I had stopped eating to the point where I would eat once a day or every few days. A few months after that around late December I started getting really anxious and I also started seeing and hearing things. I would sometimes see faces in walls or there would be like a man that would watch me from a distance, (kinda like slender but all black and not as tall) well I thought it had just to do with anxiety so I told my mom that I was depressed and that I was hearing things. She told me not to tell the dr that I was hearing things bc it was most likely in my head so I did what she said and my dr sent me to a therapist. I was at first kinda relived to go see one thinking I would get help but as soon as I entered the room I had a the feeling that this girl was going to follow me home and torture me. I kept the thought to myself but I was very scared of her after the therapy I told my mom that I don’t wanna go back and she respected me.

Well whenever I was getting hallucinations (mainly audible, rarely visual) I thought they were real but they would only last for a few seconds or few minutes then they would go away. This made school very hard and maintain friendships hard. Voices would tell me to do horrible things like suicide, hurting myself, hurting people because they were gonna hurt you first. I don’t know why but then I started having delusions where I thought my ex and my bestfriend hacked into my phone and was watching me and listening to me through the cameras. There were times where I’d be laying in bed about to fall asleep then I feel something get in bed with me and put there hand on my arm and whenever that happened I would freeze up. So one night I a week ago I decided to look up my symptoms and schizophrenia came up so I’ve been doing a lot of research on that. I never even heard of schizophrenia until I looked it up. I told my mom mostly everything including a bunch of other things not mentioned. I’m only 15 I’m terrified for what’s gonna happen whenever I go to the dr and tell her what’s really been happening and I’m afraid there gonna send me away because the voice that tells me the future said that’s gonna happen and I’m going to live there so am I crazy??

Its been 11 years of struggling with multiple things. But I always wanted to make music. Had verses I’d write and just leave alone. That day I told myself, If im going to kill myself, lemme at least try and put a short song or rough demo out, like I’ve always wanted. I did. Wasnt perfect but I got alot of good feedback. Then made 2 more after that in a months time. My point is, I thought one day I was gonna wake up and I’d be ready to pursue what I wanted. Took mulitple mental breakdowns and hitting rock bottom to realize that day never comes, you just have to push through it. I still get the suicidal thoughts but not as much as I did before.

TW: self-harm, bullying, homophobia

I’m not sure what happened. I had been feeling like my old self again before the anxiety &amp; depression and hadn’t self harmed in almost a year. Without a warning, I started remembering old things I did when I was like 12-14 years of age. Bad things.  I did it since I wanted to break my reputation of being the nice and quiet teachers pet and become popular and well liked. What is really haunting me is how I pretty much used to be homophobic. 


Some of the things I feel really remorseful about was how I used the word “gay” as an insult and comedy bit. I even kept on using it on my friend “jokingly” and they even told me “jokingly” to knock it off and I didn’t. It caused us to break up the friendship when we were like 13 since I thought they were overreacting. I can’t push that guilt off of me. I also played a part in spreading a rumor about someone else being non-straight in my freshman year of high school  (someone told me and I shared with someone else). 

I knew what I did was wrong at the time but not the gravity of it. The guilt is consuming me, more than it did when these events happened. It’s been more than 10 years. I can’t concentrate on anything else but these actions. I wish I could go back in time and never do it so I can finally feel like a good person. I didn’t think I was hurting anyone at the time, but I obviously was.

31,"When I was 5-7 years old, my half-brother would molest me. I was young and I trusted him, and didn't know any better. I thought nothing of it growing up, and the experience led me to frequent sexual thoughts ever since. I couldn't sleep without having random fantasies, and I constantly craved relationships.

When I reached the age of 17, I realized how wrong the situation was. By that time my brother had already left home to live with his girlfriend. I told my mom the truth, hoping that would help me get overcome it. And all she had to tell me was, ""I knew."" I was shocked and confused, and I cut the conversation, deciding to keep my thoughts to myself. I cried that night.

Two years later my brother informs us that he wants to move back in because he and his girlfriend had broken up. I say no. He had come over to visit a few months prior, drunk out of his mind, and had tried to full on kiss me in the kitchen while my mom did whatever in the living room. I cried as I explained this to them and my sister and mom just sat there watching me. My mom explained to my sister that I had been molested as I child. I don't feel safe around him, I told them. And they still tried to convince me that it was the best thing to let him back in if we want to ""keep the family together"", as we aren't so close with out relatives and ""only have each other"". No, mom, I thought. I do not want to keep the family together. He is NOT my brother.

And yet they pressured me into giving in. I felt like the bad guy. Three of them versus me. And I'm the fucking victim.

32,"Hoping this is the right sub for this...

I have a brother a few years younger than me, approaching his mid/late 20s. His entire life has been a difficult struggle to overcome bullying, weight issues, self-image issues, everything. I probably didn't help back when we were kids - my life was a lot easier. Girls. Friends. Good grades. Etc. None of that for him.

His life is much better now and he's doing well for himself (on the outside). We've been getting closer and talking more (from separate states), but I'm realizing he still has a lot of trauma from these times in his life and he is depressed. He's not happy and hasn't really EVER felt happy, and doesn't really have hope or faith that happiness will come. He's cynical and jaded because of all the things he's dealt with, including a recent breakup from basically his only GF ever (*he* broke up with *her* because I think he just got bored and sick of arguing). 

I had a long talk with him to try to speak about the power of positive thought, gratitude, and many more things that I've learned and discovered about happiness and fulfillment, which he is severely lacking. 

He's open to seeing a therapist, and that will be helpful. Possibly even meds would be beneficial. But I'm not really sure what else I can do or how to speak to him in a way to actually help. I'm very positive and gentle and encouraging and I've told him to try and take more action and get out of his comfort zone to find what makes him happy. He doesn't know what that is. And I get that - many of us don't. But I see why for him it's a harder void to grapple with. He has some slight interests but doesn't feel GOOD at anything in particular. His happiness is closely tied to his desire for companionship (which he's been mostly deprived of and has a poor outlook on now).

He's not ugly or obese. He's a genuinely handsome guy, tall and a tad bit overweight, but nothing he couldn't shed with the right mindset and motivation. I'm aware none of these superficial things translate into someone's own self-image. His is damaged for sure.

He told me he's thought about suicide before, but fortunately I think it's only a thought. I know I need to take it serious though, and I did (by telling him to NOT think like that and why he has a lot of great things to live for). If nothing else, the pain he knows he would cause our family wouldn't allow him to do it, but I know that's not a great reason for someone on the edge.

I worry that I am a burden to them so I lock myself in. I don't talk to anyone.

Shes asked me not to contact her . I try so hard but i break. Because in all my life talking to her is all that helps. Without that i feel suicidal all the time, i just am too cowardly to do anything.

I know im being selfish and what im doing is wrong. I should just leave her be. But at the same time nothing else ive tried works. Ive been in and out of therapy, im on meds, try meditation. Ive lost 6kg starting working out but i feel no different. Im trying so hard and its for nothing.

I want to leave her be and respect her wishes, i really do. But i never even wanted other girls. The few ive talked to, i always feel they arent her or as good as her and i just cant forget that. Im all or nothing and got nothing.

Im tired of living like this. Her life and mine would be better with me gone.  Im sure of it. Because i dont feel my life is getting better just worse. Ive tried what i can and it just doesnt work. I feel so alone and alienated from society. If it all crashed down i wouldnt care. Idk. Maybe some people are better off dead and gone.

Im working up the courage to end things. I know i sound selfish and pathetic and disrespectful. I truly dont mean to be, its just i try and go back to the one thing thats ever helped. But its not fair on her . She owes me nothing no one does.

I just really want this all to end. I cant do this much more.",07Jun2020,1
35,"So yeah. Before you ask, I have all those diagnoses... I usually help around reddit, talk to people. But where I am I can't rely on anyone... my grandmother had an stroke years back, she lives with my parents and me.  My father's a bit of a dead beat. And my mom carries everything on her shoulders... 

I try not to be overwhelmed... I look back on my suicidal times and hope and wish I never feel like that again... normally I'd just take one of my prescription pills to help me deal, but my mother is smiling. I rarely see her smile so openly, it's not a fake smile. I know those... if she sees me taking them, well that smile will break. I know how to pretend that am fine... I did it in college, before I dropped out. I don't regret it, I have my reasons. I made a decision. 

Somedays I try to exercise. But I have a project am working on... and beyond that I have little motivation to exercise I look on other people my age, twice the looks and twice the muscle... with the motivation to exercise while I, some days, can't push myself to eat properly. 

I feel particularly overwhelmed right now. I really don't have a reason for that... wished I did, though. Then perhaps the title to this wouldn't be a mathematical formula. I like comic books, typical awkward nerd, Darkseid's anti-life Equation... Sometimes it feels like it should start with a variable ""D"" for Depression.",07Jun2020,1
36,I do this thing where whenever I have an interaction with a person I can’t speak my own voice. I don’t know how to describe it but I can’t speak my own words.

37,"Having to take a deep breath here....
I ask myself ""was my childhood THAT bad??"" Alot. Trying to force myself into thinking I just developed all my issues from my own accord because I have and always feel like a piece of trash that can never be good enough for anyone. 

My family...the ones who should've been there at my downfall, were the ones standing there ready to push. 

I was sexually abused for 7 years by an older sibling. Grew up in a very strict Christian household so you are forbidden to speak of sex in a non educational way. I was labeled a whore by my mother and father when they discovered that I had been watching porn and speaking to people I shouldn't have on the internet, sending pictures back and forth. I started at the age of 11. 

Men that were clearly in their 30s talking to me and showing me attention, listening to me talk about my problems and telling me I was beautiful and had a beautiful body and how shitty my brother was for ever hurting me and that I should run away. 

But all along the way, was it really THAT bad? 

We didn't always have money, my dad didn't even go to college until I was 5-6. He mopped floors at a paper mill just to keep us going. My mom was a stay at home parent homeschooling us, giving us fun projects all the time and encouraging craftsmanship and artistic talent. 

My home was ideal to anyone who came over. So why did I dread being there. Ask anyone, they would've much rather came to my house because we were able to bake cookies and paint and make different crafts. But for me it was still..terrible. 

I finally had the chance to not be isolated at home around my abuser when my parents decided to send me to a Christian school. I thought it was amazing because I could hang out with friends without being around my parents... They knew about my brother when I told them because he tried a few times on my neighborhood friend at the time who ended up disassociating and saying it never happened when I told my boyfriend at the school who then showed the entire football team. (Private school, super small 100 people max including the teachers) 
So I was forced to leave the school due to causing drama. My mom I'm pretty sure spoke to the councilor assuring her that what I said never happened and that I'm a problem child. 
Well my mom quit the job she started in order to stay home so we couldn't possibly ""explore"" each other again. 
(He literally blackmailed me into doing it and admitted this) 
I was self harming...suicidal and angsty. I downed a bottle of ibuprofen and sat in the bathtub hoping I'd drown when I really just threw it up before it could do anything and hated myself for being such a failure. 
While I was withdrawn from the school, my brothers tuition was anonymously paid.. rubbing salt in the wound for me. 

I begged my parents to take me to therapy and to get medication. But my brother was better when he went to Bible camp so my parents said no. And added that it was dangerous because if I tell them what happened my parents could have me taken from them and my brother put in jail. And it wasn't fair that my parents worked so hard to get where they needed to be only for ME the failure of the family to tear everything apart. So I internalized that as me being the problem, maybe I did allow him to do things to me because I was just a messed up individual from watching porn (he started this as far as I can remember since I was 6-7) 

My dad on the other hand has a track record as well. My half sister has document proof from the court case where he was forced to give up parental rights or her mom would expose him for molesting her. 

Yeah this goes beyond just that. 

My sister barely saw us, my dad made sure we would understand that she would only believe the ""lies"" that were fed to her and she'd never see him as the father he was. So he would get angry and refuse for us to give her gifts sometimes, go to her wedding, he refused to have anything to do with his grand children. 

Because I was refused treatment for my issues besides you know. Being anointed with oil. My issues worsened and so my parents both deemed me a whore and a pill popper because at one point I was so desperate I asked a friend for her depression medication so I wouldn't be suicidal anymore. I was determined to change myself. 

Fast forward some more of me picking the wrong guys including one who molested his 5 year old cousin and blamed it on me and called me from jail cussing me out because I wouldn't have sex with him (I was 13). 
Well for 8th grade and highschool I was enrolled in a public school system. It was crazy that I fit in with everyone there so much better. 

Fast forward a little more past me going through typical bullying and suicidal friends who ended up in the hospital and other horrible guys (a couple okay ones and some chicks) I find who is now my husband, at first he didn't believe a word that came out of my mouth and thought I was lying for attention, until he met my parents. I refused for him to meet my brother and he still hasn't to this day. 

Well before my parents met him, I kept him a secret and snuck out to see him, my mom ended up thinking I was having sex with my best friend and not a guy cuz she saw a hicky and demanded that I would find a friend to live with and leave. Well I did but that was a stupid move cuz the friend I tried to at the time didn't tell her grandmother and she cussed me out driving me back to my parents house drunk as shit and my mom denied the entire thing. 

She was so relieved to find out that it was a guy who gave me a hicky and not my friend. He was the only thing keeping me sane while my mom would come in my room throwing fishnet tights at me that she went out of her way to buy just to come home and call me a prostitute but still she refused for me to get help because they could go to jail. 
I got very rebellious, snuck out of the house many times especially when I had my car but I had to hide every single phone I ever had because my dad would freak out if I even listened to a non Christian band. One day I tested him too far and he smashed my phone into the corner of the table which sent me straight to the bathroom my mom at the other end banging on the door telling me I better not kill myself. 

I finally had enough of this shit when I was 18. I had a job and a car so I thought I was totally independent enough to leave. I moved in with a friend and her large family and family friends living there too. Welp that worked out well. 

Me and my husband broke up with each other at the time because I was going crazy wanting to drink and smoke pot all the time and have sex. I was definitely not in the right state of mind. Not to mention my mom was calling me threatening to get me fired, expelled and locked up. 
Meanwhile experiencing first hand what happens when someone falls down the hole of addiction to heavy drugs, stealing and running from the police. Our neighborhood was completely surrounded by the police. They came in and swept the house not knowing that the person ran and hid under a mattress and in an abandoned house. Days of running and no sleep. 

Basically I told my husband I couldn't take it anymore there either and begged him to move in with me and have a baby. So we did, same neighborhood, different friend. They ended up kicking us out when I had about 2 months left of highschool or so. I was desperate, looking for a place to live we rented the cheapest place we could find and after moving all the clothes in, I instantly had a meltdown and decided I could not do it. I wasn't going to be pregnant living in this filthy run down home. So we moved again...finally finished highschool miraculously graduating on the honor roll during all this ontop of living hours away from the school (able to do online work) 

Me and my husband lived with his dad for a while and had alot of issues fighting with each other and battling mental health ontop of all this plus my parents trying to chummy up to me because I was pregnant while simultaneously downing me and also getting mad that I refused to invite my brother and his wife to my baby shower ""his wife forgave him for molesting you so everything's fine now, you need to get over it"". 

Later while visiting my mom she even took me to my brother's house when my first baby was only a couple months old to ""drop something off"" while on the way to taking me home, but it was a sly attempt at letting them see my kid.  




I moved states eventually after living with in-laws for a while we got our own place but also his brother is here too instead of his other siblings. And we are doing fine now but....i still talk to my parents after a while of distancing myself from them. I want my children to know them but something deep inside hurts so badly and I keep remembering my dad saying ""what did I do that was so bad that made you want to leave""...you weren't there for me in the time I needed you the most and instead made my brother the hero of the story....the straight A student who had a 4.0 when I only had a 3.8 I got yelled at for having a 95 on a test one time because my brother wouldnt have missed those questions. 


After all that. One part of me wants to expose them for what they did. I'm still pissed that my parents and brother are living the life of luxury, being lucky enough to make it big and get engineering money. When I'm over here living paycheck to paycheck. I can't entirely blame them..I could've stayed home. I could've went to college. I could've waited to have kids. None of that was on my parents. I did all those things myself. And I feel like I'm absolute garbage because I made those decisions. 

I don't even know the point I'm trying to make anymore. 

I'm 21
Married, and I can't even have sex without intrusive thoughts. 
I developed severe pure OCD (internalized where your compulsions aren't the same as washing your hands 5 times in a row) 
I also developed DID. A mild form yet it's still haunting. 

I'm living through it. I stay strong for my babies because they deserve someone who gives a shit. Someone who's not going to let their minds crumble and fall apart because they can't wrap their minds around such a horrific chain of events. They need someone stable and strong enough to show them how to stand in the midst of intense darkness. 


But I still fight myself every day. It creeps up no matter how many projects I give myself. 

I don't know why I made this post.. I wanna expose them for what they did to me but I still feel like I'm the piece of trash who needs constant approval because after all. They're the ones who are living their best lives. 

For anyone who took the time to read this...thanks ❤️",07Jun2020,1

39,"Im a guy in my late 20’s and I feel that people can’t see past the fact that I’m balding?

I go to a friends house they have to talk about it. I see my parents, they mention about their distaste/disappointment that I am balding. My co-workers at work make somewhat rude indirect comments about it. I go to the barber and they have to make disappointed comments about it. 

Like I’m not even balding that badly? It’s just at its initial stages. But I feel like people can’t even see me as me anymore. It feels like I’m stripped of my character over my balding. I mean I can’t really do anything other than go on medication to control it, it’s out of my control as it’s genetics.

It’s gotten to the point where I don’t feel like talking to people, I don’t want to see friends or family, and more so just want to be alone. I’m honestly quite happy having alone time. But I get intense anxiety about going and meeting people I know, cause I feel like I’m going to get judged.

I know deep inside that they would notice they would care but my head just keeps telling me they don't. That they do all this because they feel bad or because they pity me. I feel like nothing is real. Nothing matters. I don't even know why I'm writing this. Maybe I have a slight hope someone will see this. Maybe I have a slight hope that if I write it out, it will all go away. I thought that talking about it would help but all they say is no we care about you. Not we understand how you feel.

Never at either because I've ruined most my short lived friendships.Social skills have completely deteriorated from already being bad. Never finish anything, I'm pretty stupid. Want to hop on a bus and be broke and not finish my education or just die.  Haven't gotten laid In almost a year. Can't function without my adderall xr or speed pills.Horribly dependent on nicotine and dabs. Always down to do whatever drug. Hate my body, hate myself more. Bored, anxious, depressed. Who isn't tho? Having deluded thoughts that everything we see on the media is brainwashing and can't tell what's real or not. Get told I'm attractive often, become uglier and uglier the more I project my stupid, mumbling, slurry voice. Done scummy things I regret.  going through a hypochondriac stage from months old swollen lymphnodes on my neck.
 I realized that getting a terminal illness is 50/50 because dying or living both sound like equally garbage options. Constant subconscious need for attention that I can not control. Had a fucked up childhood and was exposed to certain themes that I feel have made me autistic or some shit. Done alot of good and been nice but it doesn't out weigh the bad and being mean. Pathological liar(being honest rn). Constant worrying since I was a kid. Grew up a fat kid btw, went through a bully stage until i thankfully got beat up. Still feel like a stupid kid despite being 19. Didn't spend any of my youth doing sports or socializing because I wouldn't ever stick with it. Wouldn't take my ADD meds as a kid. Don't want to tell my therapist who I  constantly lie to. Afraid she'll take my addys away because of weed and I won't be able to function. Constant highs and lows. Mostly low.  Always Oversharing. Constant brain fog. Impulsive behavior that I've for the most part taken control of. Done alot of crazy shit. Either really good with people or really bad. Constantly worried about myself and my family. Fake confidence. Hurt people,stole,lied. Have a cheating fetish that's ruined any good relationships I've been in. Along with other porn induced and unhealthy fetishes. Probably fried my already semi functional brain in multiple different ways. I just want to leave. Getting my license back soon but I'm afraid of being a homeless drifter. I need to explore, see the rest of the world. At 14 I Argued with my childhood bestfriend. We roasted each other and it turned mean. We quit talking for months . He then died of Leukemia. Couldn't even get over myself for my dying friend. I bring out the worst in people on accident.

59,"Over the last month I have started wanting answers of why I express some unhealthy behaviours so I can fix them, and there is this one behaviour that I can’t find help for anywhere, it’s if something is bad/unpleasant but had something to do with my past/childhood I get to angry and then feel guilty about not liking it.
an example is me and my friend were playing sea of thieves and the tutorial had pirate/classical sounds and I get mad because I can’t drive a ship for my life and I just started crying and was torn because I wasn’t having fun after spending 50$ on a game and the music that I loved as a kid was playing.
another one of these things happened when I bought a book about model railways as I do that in my spare time but when I got it it was a paper back for people just learning how to read and started making fun of all the facts they got wrong and then out of nowhere I started to feel guilty and started to tear up thinking how 5 year old me would be so happy to get a book like that.

61,"So, for the past few years I have been dealing with major depression. I am feeling a lot better overall now and am actually being productive. But I still just feel emotionally numb. It’s not like I feel no emotion at all, just not much. The best way I can describe it would be to compare it to talking with someone, but you have earplugs in and you can barely hear them or understand what they are saying. They’re just like muted or something. I haven’t cried in about 5 years now. I used to be a pretty emotional kid but I think that (I could be talking out of my ass here i don’t know) when the depression hit me I just subconsciously suppressed my emotions so I wouldn’t have to deal with them. And now I’m fumbling around a dark room and I can’t find the switch to turn them back on. I’m not sure what I’m looking for by posting this here, maybe some words of advice or something, but I’ll probably just go to a doctor about this. I’ve also found it very difficult to talk to people and make friends. I don’t know if that’s related at all, but I just graduated highschool a week ago, and I have nobody I consider important to me, besides maybe my sister. My parents are assholes and it’s very hard to confide in them. When I first told them I was depressed they accused me of just trying to manipulate them, but that’s beside the point.

62,"hi all! so basically for my whole life i've had this tendency to revel deeply in nostalgia. it's always been a compulsion, an itch that i have to scratch. for instance, today i was feeling nostalgic about my ex boyfriend, so i just spent a half hour reading our old text messages, remembering what it was like to be together and reliving some of those feelings. it obviously only makes me feel worse. anyway i was wondering if you guys have felt this/how you've dealt with it/if this is an actual mental health issue/anything... thanks!",07Jun2020,1
63,"I'm a university student and i study at Toronto Canada. But when it's summer I come back to my country where my whole family lives. I don't really know what happens when i come back home but i just brake down somehow. I feel like a grey cloud follows me wherever i go but i manage to smile to my friends. When they ask me how I'm doing i can lie and say that I'm doing good. And sometimes i do feel like I'm okay but other times i just feel like a useless piece of shit that is no good for anyone. I don't even know if it's valid for me to write here. I feel like I'm just not good enough for anything. And my girlfriend is one of the most amazing things that ever happened to me but i just feel so bad that i can't describe how i feel to her.

64,"Sometimes I'd look at pictures of an ex and I had a hard time recognizing her despite seeing her 2 weeks prior. I would think ""I was with this person?"" and I assumed it was just because of heartbreak. 

Lately I've gotten worse mentally lately and I'd stare at my parents and I had a hard time recognizing who they were, as if I've never met them. I knew they were my parents and I loved them, but I had a hard time recognizing their faces. Just today I had the same experience with my sister where I unironically asked ""is that my sister? "" and genuinely thought it was someone else. I didn't recognize her voice or face at all despite seeing her and talking to her just yesterday at dinner. Both of my closest friends I had moments where I questioned if I actually knew them even though I met up with both of them and acknowledging their existence without issue fairly recently before that weird disconnect. 

I don't know why I'm experiencing this so suddenly, I have a good memory and I dont know if I'm just disconnecting from reality or what. I have never experienced this before.

68,"Most of my life, I have tried to emulate the great to get rid of depression, anxiety, and existential angst.  My path led me to self-improvement, spirituality, and many more—exciting areas of self-inquiry.  But something was always missing.   After seeing the animation movie The Little Prince on Netflix, I remembered my promise as a child when I read to book, that I would not lose my sense of wonder for the world. By the end of the film, I was in tears how much I have lost in becoming a functioning adult in society.  So, I started working on finding a center of belonging, what people could call a soul.  By living more intuitively, I have come to realize that learning through external sources will install an external authority. You are conditioned by ideas and your hunger for knowledge, power, love, etc. Without knowing it, you become a kind of automation in your adult life with invisible buttons. When someone presses them, you have auto-response.  Therefore most of us live in a world made up of a subset of beliefs, habits, and ideas that resonated with the originator and have some benefits but do not have to reflect our internal compass.    
To dive deeper into this specific topic on authenticity, I have written about my philosophical journey within Nietsche framework for personal transformation.

70,"Lost it all- how my life changes quickly 

2017: I had countless numbers of friends and was very liked, known and “popular”. I hid the fact I was depressed and had other issues after my best friend was shot and killed. This fucked me up since I grew up and loved him
Like a brother.
2018- Still well liked, less popular, depression got worse, felt alone and empty everyday. Tried to *TW* commit suicide. Told one of my close friends about it and we barely talked since. My girlfriend was also a super insecure person who made my life miserable this year lol. Made some friends who eventually would leave as well
2019- still depressed, lost a lot of people and friends i knew, told one of my childhood best friends about my depression and we haven’t talked since. Didn’t hang out with anyone for 11 months. 
2020- I haven’t seen or hung out with anyone since January 2019, people don’t respond to my invites. I never get any.  I really don’t understand how I lost 25-30 friends. People I cared and care about. 

I don’t quite understand what changed, I haven’t change how I act or my personality but just super quickly everything changed. I have nobody left. I don’t want to exist anymore. I have been nothing but supportive and kind to everyone. And yet they all leave. I want to do the same I want to leave myself behind. I want this life to be over with I guess. My life after 2016 hit all time lows every year. I’m losing everything. Everyone just leaves :). I hate being alone I always feel alone. Not just physically but mentally knowing I have nobody who cares for me kinda traumatized me. :)",07Jun2020,1

Whenever I feel excitement or happiness, I remember my guilt and how everything is just going to end. I have very little acquaintances and don’t have a close friend. All relationships where I can talk to someone and be social have all ended. I just don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’ve been thinking it’s depression for anxiety, but I think I’m overthinking it. I often worry about my future. I have even planned out where I’d live, what college to go to, my major, and even how I’d die eventually. I have been feeling guilty about my first crush. He was a very sweet, funny, and relatable boy. We used to talk and play a lot together. Now, I think I may have emotionally hurt him. I think I have hurt him badly. He used to be a pretty social person. Now, he rarely talks to people he knew. I think I hurt him because I wondered if he was gay. I talked to friend about this. I don’t know if she told him about it. I am not friends with her anymore because she and her family hate me. Her family has fat shamed me and have spread rumors about my family. I never hated people that are part of the LGBTQ+. I have my respect ps for them, considering I’m asexual. That boy has never talked to me since. Every time he sees me, he looks sad or sometimes angry. My mom is another reason I feel horrible. She has told me that when I was in her stomach, she had to do so much. That I understand. Being pregnant is hard. My father had abused her and was an alcoholic. He was brainwashed due to being an alcoholic. Now he is fine and has a new wife. That new wife is horrible. My mom has told me I could die wherever I want. I could jump off a bridge, or die on the street. She makes so sad I sometimes cry at night when everyone is asleep. I also weigh a lot more for my age. I am just a 13 year old at 180 pounds. I feel horrible in my body. Sometimes I feel so horrible I am selfish. My mother has always talked about herself. No one has asked my how I’m doing so far. I also have very low self esteem. I play in an orchestra. I love the viola, but had been discouraged from it. I’ve worked hard on trying to get into the orchestra chamber. I thought the people that got in were worse sounding than me. I thought I was better. I’m wrong for that. I realized that life is so simple. You only are born, make a story, and die. My mom only believes that I’m not hurt if I’m not physically injured. I just think that life is very blank and simple. I’ll die in the next 20 or more years. School makes me feel bad, too. I am very smart for my age, but I feel that doesn’t matter. I only force myself to get good grades. I only think that getting good grades will bring me happiness. It doesn’t. I dont know what makes me happy. I love anime and manga, but I see my reality when I am happy. Reality is really painful to me. I realize that we all end up the same, we die lonely. I have been feeling so horrible, I have made imaginary friends. I think that’s not normal. In the end I just need someone to be with me all the time. Someone that cares for me.

100,"Question about how i know my SSRI has worked

Hi everyone.
I’m a 25 year old male and I’ve been on Fluoxetine primarily for Pure OCD (or at least I think it’s OCD) as well as presumably various other mental health issues I’ve had for as long as I can remember. I’m currently on week 7.5 of my medication and I feel no better, different maybe but definitely not better. I’m no longer hysterically upset 24/7, not eating/sleeping etc. But I still feel absolutely awful. My obsessions/compulsions are still as strong as ever and causing my crippling anxiety and distress and within the last week I’ve also been feeling very nauseous.

I’ve been through this same experience before twice within the last 5 years and both previous times I’ve recovered and been normal (or at least felt normal) but both times I’ve foolishly stopped taking the meds and relapsed, the most recent being 7.5 weeks ago. The trouble is I literally cannot remember the recovery process from either of the previous times whatsoever except I’m sure it didn’t take this long.

I’m honestly in a really bad place at the moment and what makes it worse is that I’m worried the tablets have worked and this is as good as it’s going to get and I’m honestly losing hope. Every day feels harder and harder and even though I’m not longer in hysterics over it I feel as though I’ve accepted my hopeless situation and it frightens the life out of me. I just want more than anything for things to go back to normal but I don’t feel like they ever will.

I’d happily continue on my meds for life (assuming they work) if I had to as they’ve saved my life twice previously and I’d honestly rather avoid therapy if possible as I don’t react well to it plus I’m incredibly afraid, ashamed and embarrassed (not about having therapy but about opening up about my problems.)

I suppose the point of this post is to ask about people’s recovery processes. How long did it take? how did you feel? Was it instant like a light switch or did it take weeks/months? Etc. 

Right now I feel so hopeless and down. I feel like nothing is every going to get better and I’ll be stuck like this for what’s left of my life and I really don’t want that. Other than the mental health issues that control it, my life is generally good. I’ve always been incredibly anxious even as a kid (I couldn’t even cross the street on my own if there was someone I didn’t trust there at one point) but in regards to family life and my  general situation I couldn’t ask for better. But I’m not sure how much longer I can go on feeling like this, it’s too much and things don’t seem to be getting better. I don’t want to just “accept” how I am because I feel as though I’m just trading one negative state for another and neither are preferable.

I’ve been trying to distract myself with normal activities I enjoy like gaming, movies etc. And I’ve moved into my girlfriends house for moral support but honestly I’m finding it all so difficult and distracting myself is, in a way, making me feel worse as time goes on. Like I’m just trying to pretend the problems aren’t there only for them to come rushing back as soon as I remember or have a negative thought and it’s so tiring. I always told myself that by the 6 week mark things would be better but as I’m now approaching 8 weeks and still in such a mess I’m honestly on the cusp of giving up and I don’t want to. 

Thanks.

and she is so much obsessed with me that,wherever i go be it on any social app she finds me out,which i really appreciate this in a way or the other cause, in today's world when people rarely care about each other especially on social media she really cares about me,she really works hard to waste her time completely just for me. Can u people even imagine,how important i am to her.

and yes,many people likes her but out of them two not two,four, no not four.. actually everyone tries hard to be her eye candy but one boy he really loves her hard and sometime she just get insecure about him.

The main reason for her insecuriy is me since she had a doubt that i have some feelings for him.
Though i made it very clear earlier that i don't have anything for her play boy  but you know sometimes insecurities they just come out. 
 she is still staking me due to her insecurities.

It will be great help for her if you people help her out from all this.
poor girl.i really feel bad for her.",07Jun2020,1

104,"Lots of text incoming, tldr at the bottom.

Just a super upfront, I need help kinda post. Huge disclaimer, I know the things I am about to say are unhealthy; I have identified a lot of unhealthy things about my thought patterns I'm just overcome with frustration that I don't know how to fix them. I've used titles if you want to skim read.

BACKGROUND;
 I've been with my boyfriend just over a year now. I know I should trust him and things should be super great and I really really want that. But some stuff gets in the way. I had a lot of childhood trauma and grew up without a father as he committed suicide when I was 7, I was kicked out of my home when I was 15 because my mum's boyfriend tried to sexually assault my little sister, been cheated on before, etc. My relationships with guys have always been a bit weird, I usually make really good friends with them, and if I get romantically involved it becomes a whirlwind romance where I'm gonna marry them, for like the first 4 months or so. And usually they feel the same.

UNHEALTHY TURN; 
But I always kind of change at around the same point in every relationship. I become really jealous, as in if the guy talks to another girl in a nice way I'm certain that I'm done for, though I know better than to outwardly show it so I let it just fester and try very hard to keep it in check so as no harm is done. I start placing a lot of worth on frequency of sex, and worry I am becoming unattractive if it doesn't seem frequent enough, even when I'm not particularly in the mood, though again i make sure I do not outwardly react to this as I know it could create a lot of pressure on the relationship. I get silent sometimes if I'm in a mood because I need to work it over in my head and don't know how to express it rationally, which I know guys hate but I can't help from doing it. And I begin thinking wow, yep he resents me and will definitely come to resent me if he doesn't already. He's going to leave, he's gonna cheat. I know I'm not beautiful and I compare myself to any attractive woman my boyfriend interacts with, which means I sometimes seek assurance. I KNOW this is annoying and my boyfriend tells me this is silly and unnecessary to do every time I do it, and asked me wouldn't I get annoyed if he did the same? I agreed, I would, I want him to trust that I love him more than anything and think he's beautiful, without having to keep telling him.

 Again, I'm super aware this is all very unhealthy and a great recipe for pushing my partner away, hence my need for help.

MY PARTNER;
 I just have to say, my partner is incredible and, even after a year I have no doubt that I want to spend my life with him, we've been through a lot together and this lockdown has been a little tough, living with him and all, but it's also only proven we are a strong couple. I can't stand the thought of my own unhealthy behaviour sabotaging that like every relationship previous.

TRYING TO RESOLVE;
 I've started really noticing when these things come up in my head, and started being able to counter those thoughts when they come up to try to stop any kind of reaction or starting any unnecessary arguments, but this often takes a huge amount of thinking and rationalising before I can calm myself down. I know, in a way, this is a good thing; I'm managing to stop these shitty thoughts in their tracks and reverse them so as I begin thinking like a normal human before I let it take over me. But I just want to know... Does it get easier? Because it feels like a huge uphill battle every time, and I'm the only one who notices when I manage to win, because to anyone else obviously it just looks like I'm reacting exactly how I should by default when I do win.

THERAPY; 
I'd happily try therapy again, I've tried it many times before but it's never worked, and the waiting list is absolutely huge for free therapy, so before all the therapy comments come in, I'm super aware that maybe trying again would be beneficial, it's just impossible to see one within any reasonable timeframe. I tried to sign up to Better help but they were like ""nah you should find a real therapist we ain't ready for this shit"" which is completely garbage, why offer an accessable therapy service that declines half the people that need it for being TOO fucked up?

IN SUMMARY;
I just need some guidance because a lot of days I'll be like ""wow I'm doing great!"" And then something will happen or the next day comes and I realise how far I truly have to go to be happy and mentally healthy. It's really tough to try and grapple with and a lot of times exhausting. My partner knows of my past but I don't think he realises how much it affects me, and at the start of the relationship I would use these past events to explain some of my behaviour, but he saw it more as an excuse for the behaviours and got annoyed by it so I stopped trying. He's not the talking type, his worst nightmare is therapy, and I don't think I could ever really explain what I've been through to him without sounding like a walking sob story at this point, so I can't really just hash it out with him, as lovely as he is. Plus, my past is not his responsibility.

If anyone could offer any reassurance, advice or online services that can actually help me, I'd hugely appreciate it. Thanks for reading, I know I probably sound like a mega toxic person but I want more than anything to change that.


TLDR; my negative thought process often ruins my relationships and I'll be damned if I let it ruin this one. I'm starting to realise and slowly fix my ways, but it's a really difficult process and I'd appreciate some help where you can xox",07Jun2020,1
105,"Over the last several weeks, I have observed significantly increased levels of irritability, anger issues and a consistent lack of positive emotions. I am concerned that this shift in emotional state may boil over into something more dangerous. I am starting to believe that it may be a good idea to pursue professional help, but one of my main hurdles is the fear that by reaching out for help for myself, I am tying up resources and that my issues may not be as serious as someone else's.

I am worried that I may not be able to deal with this hurdle effectively and would like advice to help deal with it so I can get help with my problems before they get worse.

I graduated from college summa Cum Laude with a graphic design degree in Sep 2019. Since then I have done nothing. In Oct I went for interviews etc. The next month I had a devastated family conflict and my family tore apart. I was the closest to one sister and I found out that she was gossiping about me behind me back. Everyone in my family had a side to them I didn’t know. That day I felt the the worst emotional pain. I ran to an isolated park to cry that day. I felt more alone than ever. Two days later my bird best friend died &amp; I was so devastated with no support and embarrassed to grieve over a bird. I ended up isolating myself from the world, stopped looking for jobs, and just continued eBay selling for money. I went out again to enjoy life for the first time 4 weeks later and two weeks after another bird friend died. I ended up having serious suicidal thoughts &amp; I tried therapy, but it didn’t help. It’s been months now, I live back with abusive parents, a dysfunctional family, I have no job, suicidal thoughts, hate myself, feel worthless, don’t see a point to live, &amp; I still can’t get myself to unfreeze and work on getting a more stable job. I can’t believe that I had so much passion &amp; so many dreams at one point. I had a potential business and a book ready to get published but I don’t have the energy or do I care to finish it. It’s been almost a year. I have no energy for life like I used to. Going to be 25 years old soon and look at what a pathetic loser I am",07Jun2020,1

This could be unrelated but around a year ago now I woke up to what I thought was screaming, it was so loud it seemed like it was coming from the house itself.

And I was flipping out. I sat up after a few moments of that and shook my head and now I’m back to normal other than my chest hurts. What the hell was that? It wasn’t a panic attack, it felt nothing like one. I’ve had them before but this... This was crazy I legitimately lost my mind for like 25 minutes? God I’m in a lot of pain now.

MENTAL HEALTH; when I get wound up, I mean I really get wound up. When I let these thoughts run unchecked or I'm too emotionally exhausted to go through the huge process to rationalise them, I have a full blown meltdown. I have anxiety attacks out the damn WAZOO and believe it is the end of the world and I am unloved and no one will ever truly want me.

I have had the habit of procrastination from a very young age. But as time goes the procrastination level is increasing and I can't simply control it. I have this big exam coming up (it's similar to A levels) and the result of this exam depends on me going to a good university or being able to go at all. I'm from a 3rd world country where going to universities or colleges mean a lot if you want to have a  good-paying job or any non-labour job for that matter. But I just can't study, I procrastinate away all my time. I have studied almost nothing in the last 1 year and during the 3-month lockdown I haven't even been near books whatsoever. 

The problem is I know that doing this, not studying is going to have a very bad impact on my life. I can't possibly accomplish anything. I know all these but I still can't help myself. and at the same time *knowing that I'm destroying my lif*e is also literally killing me. Add to that some other issues and I'm having **suicidal thoughts** but at the same time I'm somehow scared to take my own life

I haven't really been able to share these with anyone because us well parents in 3rd world countries don't care about their children's mental health neither do I have any very close friend whom I can rant with.

i’m not diagnosed with bd and i’ve honestly never been manic nor hypomanic (to my knowledge). i have been taking lithium for over two and a half years now, but i always thought it was for unipolar depression. i also take lexapro (3 years now), vyvanse (3 years too) and as needed xanax (1.5 years). i took remeron (3 years) until march when i quit it cold turkey because the restless legs and twitches at night were unbearable and i was tired of being so ravenous. im 20 and have a history of recurrent depressive episodes starting at 12, past hospitalizations, ptsd from r*pe at 12 and dissociative amnesia with the ptsd. despite having recurrent dep episodes and taking lithium, i don’t have an official bd diagnosis and i’ve never been manic

but i think i’m manic now. sleeping 2 hours a night, thinking something stupid like “what if a mouse wore a hat” and laughing hysterically for 10 minutes (he would be cute though), walking 6 miles a day, literally no appetite at all, for the first time in my life i love myself and i really do think i’m above everyone. which brings me to the delusions i think i’m having about being a goddess and this human body is just temporary because i have to see how humans live before i rule them. i have all these weird notes i’ve been writing, but at the same time it feels so real. like i don’t know which things are delusions and which is reality, it all feels real

so i’m typing super fast so i don’t think something like “the mania is part of my goddess initiation” and feed into my excited mood. what can i do while i’m calmer right now to make sure my mood doesn’t accelerate much? what can i do to try to ground myself? i’ve never been manic and despite being in treatment for years and being a psych major, i don’t know a lot about mania. i posted here yesterday but i got really confusing and had to take it down. just i could really use some advice please.

Couple days prior to the day I sincerely apologised and said I’m busy and can’t make it as I have a few things going on right now and I’ll get in contact with him when I can. It’s been a week since then and he has called me over 20 times on my number and social media late at night and early in the morning, waking me up and stressing me out. 

He lives far away and I’ve only just passed my driving test, all his friends that I don’t know will be there and he set me up with a girl that I do not wish to sleep with. I struggle with social anxiety which I have explained to him in the past. He also keeps on talking about women in a disgusting way, saying we can take turns making the tent sticky (the plan was to go camping) and loads of other horrible things. That and everything else was putting me off. 

I am actually going through some stuff right and everything was making it worse. I am starting to not want to be friends with him anymore with the way he acts and the things he says and how he is now harassing me and not giving me space when I clearly said I am busy and will contact him when I can, maybe I could have been more clear but I would of thought someone would get the picture? I could have probably done something different for this to not have happened but still...

135,"As a male being bullied from middle to highschool and having emotionally unsupportive parents that shunned me once I decided to drop out because I couldn’t take the abuse anymore, is there anyway for me to recover. I’ve become bitter and never shared my struggles with anyone.  Now I can kinda share it only because I feel numb and kinda suffer from disassociation. My typical day these past 2 years has been staying in my room majority of the day. 

I also suffer from just so much anger and tension in my head. 
The only thing to really provide relief for me was weed but it made me aware of my emotions and it was so dark that I decided to not do it anymore. 

Furthermore was emotionally abused by my own family for not meeting their standards when I was going through hell all my adolescence in school. 


Am I too far gone to recover ? Like I’m in an extremely bad emotional state and have become a social recluse. Tried medication didn’t help. Even tried Benzos even they were not enough numb the pain . I’m not taking anything now maninly because nothing helped and I’m not going to take medication that has a bunch of side effects if it doesn’t help.

A month ago today, my mom had a reaction to a medication which caused her to have a panic attack that lasted probably somewhere near 2 hours. Since then, she’s been diagnosed with gad, and prescribed all kind of medications. The thing is, she almost always gets the side effects of most prescription medications, so everything is making her symptoms worse. She can barely eat even though she’s forcing food, she can barely sleep even though she’s trying everything we can to try and get some, she’s foggy headed all the time and says it feels like she’s drunk, her gut health is all kinds of messed up, and she always has to have someone with her. I’ve struggled with symptoms similar to this since February, but medical marijuana helps a lot of my symptoms so I’m still able to function. I just don’t know what to do, she loses more hope every day, she’s tired of feeling like she’s living in a nightmare, and we’re tired with her as well.  She’s changed her diet (when she can force food, she’s only getting around 500 calories per day), she’s making sure to walk a bunch for exercise, she’s getting sunlight, practicing deep breathing, listening to happy music, staying supplemented and hydrated, and avoiding worrying about things, but none of it has helped.

Threw my spare change in the wishing well
The dream alone is always in your hands
If that don't fill the boy and build the man
A heart has many secrets, so I'm told
Through the years, a theory can grow cold
I'm up to be the king, it's gotten clear
The voice inside my head is the one I hear

Singing, I'm gonna love me again
Check in on my very best friend
Find the wind to fill my sails
Rise above the broken rails
Unbound by any ties that break or bend

No clown to claim he used to know me then

It was bad as a child, if my mum invited me somewhere and I said no, I’d feel an overwhelming sense of guilt and an urge to go just incase something like a car crash happened. 

This has slowly escalated over the years. I’m now 26 and afraid of thunderstorms (which I used to love) because it feels like somethings wrong, almost apocalyptic. 

My partner and I are interested in politics and often discuss varying topics in the news etc. But lately, given what’s going on with the pandemic, BLM and the multiple countries that seem to be on the brink of war, I can’t discuss it as my anxiety just sky rockets.

151,"Hi. I’m a 17 year old boy living in America. I have been dealing with certain aspects of my mental health for a while, and I genuinely don’t know what to do anymore. I just want some kind of advice so I can try to fix it before college, preferably without medication.

I’m not quite sure how to describe what I’ve been going through, but there are a couple of aspects to it. 

1. I used to think I was the smartest person in the world, genuinely. I thought I could understand how people worked, what they wanted, even what they would like for me to do. I fell really hard into this idea and even acted on it a couple times, buying somebody something at one point because I thought it was what they wanted. It got to the point that I began to think I would be better at communicating with them if I acted differently towards them. I made characters, I guess, that I acted as with different people, and it did work for a while. I got too confident in this “ability,” at one point, I think, and that’s what made me realize I wasn’t really that good with people or that smart. I don’t know if any other thoughts like this have happened or are happening, but this is the one I can describe.

2. Those characters that I created kind of became their own people inside my head. Sometimes they would talk to me, sometimes to each other, it’s gotten to the point that I don’t know if they’re just characters I’ve created, or if they’re real. One of them has started saying very disturbing things that I won’t go into detail about. I have to admit that I have almost acted on one of these suggestions, specifically I wrote a suicide note with plans to kill myself, but my family intervened. Currently I am seeing a therapist for depression because of this intervention, but I don’t know if it’s really depression or something else.

3. I frequently have trouble concentrating and have started using fidget toys or whatever is available to try and focus. In this regard, music has been of great help to me. Whenever I was feeling a little off or fidgety I would pick up an instrument and start playing something to distract myself. The idea of music became so ingrained in my perception of coping that I have been seriously considering a performance major once I go to college. I have also found video games to be a great coping mechanism. 

That’s all I can think is wrong with my situation right now, there’s probably much more under the surface though. The only person I have told about this so far is my girlfriend. If you don’t have any advice that’s fine, but thank you for considering anyways. Have a nice day.",07Jun2020,1

Last year i wanted to lose a bit of weight, and over the course of a year I’ve gone from 14.8 stone to 10.8 stone, through calorie counting and exercise. Im getting worried however, as its starting to take over my life. I love eating, but feel guilty whenever i eat, even if its within my ‘calorie limit’. Im terrified of putting on weight and exercise 2-3 times a day. Anything that involves food or drinking, i see as calories and weigh these things up in my head. Im a 6ft 1 male and I currently eat around 1500 calories a day, with around 700 calories of exercise. I feel stressed at the thought of eating, and not being in control of my eating. Today for example, i went for a picnic with my mum and she brought the picnic. I ate two sandwiches, a bag of twiglets and some mini oreos, and now feel terrible. Its frustrating as now that experience which was lovely feels slightly ruined. Im not sure what i want out of posting about this, I just dont want this to rule my life anymore.

160,"It’s been awhile since my last post. Now that we’re in quarantine, I’ve done a lot of thinking. I’ve looked back on the years and have noticed something huge in my life. I’m scared of my dad. He never physically assaulted me or abused me in anyway. He just has a bad temper and can say awful things to my brother and I. My dad has always been a vocal person for as long as I can remember. When I was little, I never really thought about it to much because he was my dad. But, as soon as I got older (maybe 7-9) he grew more vocal towards my family. He would get annoyed by the slightest things and get so mad that my mom would have to step in and tell us to go to our room to block out the noise. If nothing was perfect for his standards, we would hear about it. As the years past, it only got worse. Nothing was ever good enough for him. I eventually stopped telling him things and tried to avoid him at all costs. I think now looking back, I crave positive attention because all I’ve ever received from him is negative feedback. I have older siblings as well. They have all moved away and have ceased contact with my family including my brother and I. I never understood why until now. They left because of him. When I was younger I was always afraid of my friends dads and would always refuse to talk to them or to ask them for anything. I think I got that from my dad being so mean to us that I wasn’t comfortable enough around them. (They were all nice people btw it wasn’t like they were mean or anything). My brother isn’t affected as much as I am. I’m guessing because he’s a boy and he just couldn’t care less. Around the beginning of quarantine, I was helping my brother move rooms since he wanted to move into the basement. I had to take an air conditioner and move it out of the way. I placed it on the mattress and chunks of dirt came out of it. My dad went Biserk and said “Your a fucking dumbass!!! How could you be so stupid”. And right after he left the room, I broke down into tears into my grandmas arms. After, I thought I was overreacting and my grandma told me not to accept the fact that he hurt me emotionally because it wasn’t my fault. I’ve been trying to research why I’m so scared of him and why I’m so shy and I can’t really find anything. Ive been told my whole life that I’m just a quite person. I came to accept it but I wanted to know why. I also believe that because of my father, I cannot lose any weight.

As someone who struggles with their mental health, and is extremely aware of others' mental health, it's frustrating that she only brings it up when she needs an excuse, or when she is looking for pity. She has said and done things that directly attack my character, and when I call her out for it, she says ""sorry, it's just my anxiety that makes me think that"".

I could get into the finer details about this, but I'm mostly just looking for ways to respond to her when it happens. It's manipulative and makes her think that she is justified in her poor actions.

When they are both in the kitchen I open my door , trying to listen what they say , hoping that they wouldn’t start fighting . When I hear their voices louder than before I freeze and can’t stop worrying about them fighting .

When they are coming back from work my chest is heavy and I start shaking . For a few days now I cried every day even if nothing happened . ( They are not fighting every day or every week but when it does it’s really bad )

He’s pretty jealous so when my mom’s phone rings more than two times and she doesn’t answer I start worrying because when she doesn’t answer he gets mad so I need to find her and give her phone .

171,"TW: Suicidal talks and depression. I just really want to know what happened.

I'll try to keep it reasonably lengthed and as concise as possible. I am 19F, my depression started in the fifth grade. Truly, I woke up one day and just had trouble focusing on the test I had that day. I could barely read and comprehend even the simplest of words. I got that test back and it was a C. The first C I ever got. I was always a straight A student that the teachers adored. So that crushed me, and I had a thought that said exactly ""Guess you aren't that smart after all,"" and it spiraled from there. I dealt with severe depression where I would lay in bed all day. I wouldn't brush my teeth. I wouldn't shower. Wouldn't go out. I had constant, uncontrollable thoughts criticizing my every move and I was EXTREMELY suicidal. Constant thoughts of harming myself in any way. My chest and heart physically ached from the sadness I had. Bad anxiety and social anxiety.

I didn't get medicated help until I was 15. Paxil was the first try. Made things worse. I was put on Zoloft which just made me have less mood swings. But after 6 months, it was clear it wasn't working. I voiced my difficulty reading and concentrating. He said perhaps I had ADD, and put me on Adderall.

Adderall immediately perked me up. I was finally able to read again. I picked it back up as a hobby because from 3rd to 4th grade before all this started I loved reading. 

But, when I would crash after the Adderall it would hit me hard. I was still suicidal, but in a casual way. I would never actively attempt, but it was one of those situations where if a truck was about to hit me I would make no effort to move away.

Told my doctor. Changed Zoloft to Viibryd. I had terrifying, intense dreams. I felt everything. The pain. It was so real that when I would wake up I didn't know if I actually did or not. Trazodone was added to the mix to help me sleep at night and get rid of the vivid dreaming. It worked, but barely did anything to my depression and feelings of worthlessness. I started hallucinating and hearing voices telling me to kill myself. I knew they were not real, but it was stressful nonetheless. I had intense feelings of paranoia.

I had a mental breakdown in my GP's office so my parents finally gave in and took me to a psychiatrist.

I was immediately diagnosed with psychotic depression. My psychiatrist whiplashed me and completely changed my meds off. Took me off the Adderall and gave me Prozac and Abilify. Also a huge list of fucking vitamins and told me to drink Premier protein shakes three times a day. They are a lot of vitamins, but if anyone is interested I can tell you everything I took. I should note that I quit that Adderall cold turkey without any withdrawls.

I was desperate and I followed his advice, even though it felt so stupid. He also genetic tested me. I wouldn't get these results until later, but I will just tell them to you know: I have an altered COMT function which means I don't metabolize adrenaline well. Which is further justification for taking me off of the Adderall. I also had something else going on and was prescribed Deplin; which is a methylfolate that is a medical food that is suppose to make the antidepressant work better. This is all important to know for later.

I didn't like the psychiatrist but I followed what he said regardless. They just drug tested me every damn time and when I just couldnt piss they accused me of taking drugs or something, which was causing my hallucinating. At this point, the hallucinations and voices stopped. The Abilify was working. But, it started making me feel like my muscles were burning constantly. Like if I didn't move, the energy would pent up and it was extremely uncomfortable. It made it impossible to sleep. They called it akathisia. There was no relief. It was honestly the most tortuous thing I had ever experienced. They put me on Cogentin twice a day and it stopped, just like that.

Problem was, I had absolutely no energy or will to do anything. The depression, miraculously, was getting better. I did not feel as suicidal. Eventually, it stopped completely. I didn't feel ""right"", but I didn't want to die anymore. This carried on for about four months.

That's when the panic attacks started. The overthinking was still there. I was prescribed Xanax and treated like a drug seeker while the PA put in the order. I didn't ask for it by name. I took it once when I felt a panic attack coming on and it made me feel like absolute shit. I cut it in half for the next time and the same thing happened. I felt so bad and it knocked me out. I woke up so jet lagged and groggy and physically ill that I thought it better to just suffer through the chest pains of a panic attack the next time it happens.

I was in surgical tech clinicals at this time and I could not do anything. I was so anxiety ridden and falling behind. I got depressed again and consequently stopped taking my meds. I stopped them all. The Prozac, the Abilify, the Cogentin, and the Deplin and all the vitamins. I felt like nothing was working. I do want to note though that while I still didn't feel ""right"", I wouldn't say I was depressed and I was definitely NOT suicidal.

I saw my Adderall on the shelf and decided that fuck it, it helped me before, maybe just THIS is all I need. I decided that next week on my clinical day I'll take 10mg in the morning and just see what happens. I have nothing else to lose. 

The day went smoothly. I did a bunch of surgeries really well. The invasive and self-critique and low self esteem melted away. I was able to think properly and focus. I know that Adderall makes you do that, but this was the first time I felt normal in almost 8 years. I could confidently say I had a great day.

&amp;#x200B;

And just like that, everything has stopped. It has been about two weeks now. I feel normal. I am not depressed. I am not suicidal. I am not anxious. I have just been taking my Adderall that I had left over. I went back to my GP and explained everything. He said that I know what helps me and if this helps, then he will support me through it. I got another Adderall prescription. I have not told my psychiatrist yet. I have an appointment with the PA in about two weeks. I still have abandoned all my medications and I have been just taking my Adderall.

I can confidently say that I am very content with life and I am happy. I feel like I can do school again and my dreams of being a medical doctor may come true if I work hard enough. I look forward to life. I can 100% with confidence say that in the 8 years this has happened.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not a source of depression, but I still cannot help but have a bit of a disturbing feeling in the back of my mind. What happened? Why has it stopped all of a sudden? Will it come back? It doesn't feel like it will. Was Adderall all I needed? Did I even have depression in the first place, or was it just ADD? Did having the Zoloft with the Adderall really cause that many issues? Sometimes, I wonder, what if I was just prescribed Adderall?

I know you're not suppose to just stop meds without telling your doctor. But I did, and I'm glad I am. I no longer have weird thoughts or moments of brain fog that the Abilify gave me or the moments of uncomfortable mania and racing thoughts Prozac would give me.

I am confused as to what happened. Did I get better? Is this what healing feels like? It feels good, but something just feels off.. or does it feel off only because I haven't known what normal feels like in so long?

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to add that there was no childhood trauma. My depression seemed to come out of thin air.

&amp;#x200B;

Reading back, I don't even know really what I am asking here. I just feel good but in retrospect I am just so confused. It started in a flash, and now its ending in a flash. Does anyone know what the hell happened? Am I going to be okay? Can I finally close this chapter in my life?",07Jun2020,1

I built this one to reference only banned books by the likes of Chomsky or dozens of banned books on the occult or current situations....

175,"There are people who check out of politics because they do not think certain matters affect them and that the news is overwhelming. It is awful to watch terrible things happen to others but the ability to check out is a privilege afforded by certain people in the mental health community. If you check out over the generations of exploitation and dehumanization of the black community, it is morally wrong. Do not check out because of mental illness and being overwhelmed, there are so many ways to fight against injustice. Educate yourself and find ways to participate. 
It is argued that not everyone has the mental capacity to get involved. That it seems people are asking others to engage in behavior which will induce panic attacks, depressive episodes, flashbacks, etc. That some people can’t do this right now. 
We are not guilting you into certain situations when we are highly vulnerable already. However, this is a movement, and not a moment. Everyone can partake in anti-racist work. There are ways to get involved that do not trigger these things, it is important not to opt-out.",07Jun2020,1

When I was in middle school and my early stages of high school, I had a lot of anxiety and panic attacks over my breathing. I would think about whether I was breathing too loudly, start to obsess over it, and then because I was having a panic attack it was a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy where *everyone* I would actually start breathing too heavily. It sounds very strange but I did want to name it and wonder if anyone else went through this.

189,"I am very lonely. It keeps me up at night. It distracts me from studying. It's all I can think about. Last summer I ended my friendship with my only friend of 7 years, because it became very toxic and frankly, I started hating her. Having that kind of relationship, I never cared to meet other people. I was very comfortable with her. We had our own thing. We were happy. We spoke in English all the time instead of our native language. The seventh year, we were constantly fighting, it became very tough to be friends, and I thought it was time to let it go.

 Incidentally, right around then, I reconnected with someone I met in middle school; Emily. We were going to the same middle school and turns out we were going to the same college. We started hanging out. I was very excited. I fell in love with her. In college, we formed a group of friends. I was very pleased with the way things turned out. I thought, I finally belonged. But where she could make everyone laugh and spill their deepest darkest secrets, I found I was unable to reach out and build deep meaningful connections like that. My relationships with the rest of the group were platonic. I realised that I was unable to be funny or smart while looking someone in their judgmental eye. But I could be those things when texting in the group chat. And it's something they noticed. So every time I'd get past that mental block and make a joke, someone would say oh look she has a sense of humor. The thing is, because for seven years, I only communicated with one human being in a totally different language than to the one these people spoke, I didn't know how to reach out to them. I didn't know what made them laugh, I didn't know half the words they used.. 
Sometimes we'd all be sitting together and they will be so excited with one another, joking around, being affectionate.. and I'd join in, I'd try to be part of the conversation, but I'd get ignored. Not because they are bad people, but because I have nothing interesting to offer and at some point, people are gonna stop caring. So I retreated onto myself. This new discovery has made me very sad; it was eating me up and I couldnt express to them why I wasn't so jovial anymore. I felt the wedge between us, starting to take place. 
 With coronavirus, I lost contact with them completely. I tried to keep my relationship with Emily afloat. I'd video call, once in a while, always sending Instagram memes. But it felt like she wasn't interested anymore. On video call, right around the 3min mark, she'd tell me 'hey, my mom needs me. I'll call you back later' but then she'd never call back. When I stopped sharing memes, I realized I was harassing her with all these messages when she would just leave me on read.
 The fact, that no one cared, no one wanted to know how I was, made me miserable. I tried to accept the fact that I was alone and there is nothing wrong with that. I'd find someone, at some point, right? But it's been a month and I am still sad and lonely (cringe but it is what it is). I am suffocating. I want to cry, but the tears won't come. I want to fix my friendships but I can't change the fact that I am boring. I want new friends but I don't know where to meet people and how. I want to drink myself into oblivion but in my family alcohol is a sin and I don't know how to go behind their backs. I want help. I want to be able to understand them and to speak their language.

I'd be lying if I havent considered extreme measures but I think a lot of people have. I dont want this to be about that but just want somewhere to let this all out. Dont even know why I'm doing this.

My mother was murdered last november. It was a day after I applied for a job back home a few states over. My mom was always really the only family member in my life with any sense of consistency or really the only person in my life I could call when I felt like I do now and she knew exactly what to say or do to make it all better. She was also the only family member we had within 1600 miles. Also why i applied to a job back home. I got the job in the midst of dealing with all of this, which was probably the best and worst possible thing having to explain my situation to people at work or why I sounded like I was a mess to multiple people. My company took good care of me. Allowed me a paid month off, paid for all my families stuff to be moved across the country, gave me relocation assistance ect. While all that is great I feel now it probably wasn't the best. Right after all of this I had no time really to let it out...between moving, leases, packing, and everything else involved with a cross country move I had no time to stop. My uncle and grandma came out to help with things, help with my son... but they left and I flew my other half out with my son and stayed behind to handle all the arrangements. Didnt really have time to grieve. 

Arrived at my new location living with in laws for a while. Planned to get our own place soon after saving up and paying off cards. All is well, new location of work isnt the most ideal I'll admit but being near family in this time helped a lot. Still really no time to grieve. Then covid. Being stuck at in laws now for a good while longer than expected after living on my own for 10 years probably didnt help the situation. Bottling up all my emotions for so long caused me to start being abrasive when I'm naturally a butterfly type personality. Friction between me and the other half started to get bad. Work peers not having the same outlook on things also added more stress due to them practically abusing employees verbally when I have more of an empowering mindset. That added more to home stress. Ontop of my mom, covid, the world. All while I just bottled it up....

We decided to take time apart and for me to stay with my grandma for a while. Who knows... this could be permanent. Not being together anymore, not being with someone I've spent the majority of my adult life with that I love. I'm to blame for that, I get it. I should of sought out help. I should of done more to let it out. I shouldnt of let it consume me or alter my being and allow me to take it out on my other half. Never the yelling type or god forbid the abusive type but really just shut down and shut out. Kindof just felt like I got to a point where little things upset me more than they should have and I didn't have the capacity to respond normally. No excuse.


Really don't know why I'm here writing this but I feel I just need to get it out. I guess i just feel like there really isnt much more that could go wrong. I lost my mom who really was the only family member I had any connection with. Really the only one my son had a connection with. Had to push all that down. Moved to a new area. New job. Now lost my family really. And ofcourse as I'm writing this my sciatic nerve left me immobilized the past two days. I just wish I could go back to last October for a day so I can not feel this way for just a day. 

I just dont know what to do anymore. I've contemplated just driving and not stopping just to clear my head. I've contemplated other things but I wouldn't do that even more so because my son needs his dad. I just dont know. I dont think I can live without my son and his mom in my life after all this.

I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for nearly a decade now, started when i was a preteen. 
I have never been able to get over it. I’ve been to counsellors, taken medication, tried being more social, and all it’s done is make me feel like things are never going to get better. 
I didn’t have a plan after high school or something I aspired to do for my career because I never thought I would get that far in life. 
My life has sucked. I’ve always thought of myself as super ugly and unlikable but a lot of people over the years don’t understand why I feel these things about myself. 
My boyfriend especially doesn’t understand why I don’t think I’m a ‘bombshell’, but I can’t help what I think when I look in a mirror. I avoided mirrors for years, actually, more specifically I avoided any reflective surface. It got to a point where I was stupid good at it. If I had to look in a mirror at an appointment where I had to see if glasses looked okay on me, for example, I would do this thing with my eyes where I would ‘haze’ over my vision so all I saw was a blur of my face. 
Now I can’t even go into a store and purchase/order something because my anxiety is soooo high. All I think in my head is that people are thinking I’m hideous or stupid or annoying. 
I’m mainly worried about ruining things with my current boyfriend over my insecurities. I truly do feel like I’m dumb, ugly, and will never be successful or happy.

201,"Hello 

I have been fishing for about 3 years now. I guess this would be a 'wellness' post according to the sidebar. The reason I am making this post is because I am describing a low-cost solo activity that makes being by yourself exciting, at least for me, and figure I might as well share it with you redditors who might be seeking such an experience. It's not as boring as it looks and I'll try to convey this thought.

Recently I have gotten into what I call lazy fishing, which I define as fishing where you're not actively reeling in your bait/lure. Instead, you toss it out once and then wait for the fish to come and take it. It's strategic (will explain).

The main lazy fish is called a 'common carp'. It is like a goldfish but larger, with weights in the 10-30 pound range (like 5-14 kilograms). Almost every freshwater pond, lake, or river should hold carp. (I target 'common carp') 

**What you can expect:** you waiting patiently for up to several hours for a fish, depending on how heavily targeted they are where you're fishing. Some ponds that I have been to, I will get a fish in 5 minutes. The fish will fight for several minutes. 

**How:**  Carp stir up the muck on the bottom, releasing trapped air bubbles to the surface which is an indication that they are feeding. Spot those bubbles and a carp is nearby. Those bubbles will remain on the surface for several seconds, good to know (not all bubbles are carp bubbles). 

What you do is you take *canned sweet corn*, should cost less than a dollar for a can. Carp eat from the bottom so you toss a handful of corn out, then you wait for them to detect the corn on the bottom and start feeding on it. Your fishing setup is just a small circular hook with a weight attached maybe 20 cm away from the hook. If there is interest in the comments I will be more clear with the setup. 

I can suggest a fishing rod/more info in the comments if there's interest, I am just trying to introduce the concept.

Also imagine a fishing rod, if u havent used one, the fish pulls the line and theres a knob which adjusts how easily they can pull line (called 'drag'), you need to set it very loose meaning that a very small force will let loose line, if its too tight then the carp will run off with your entire rod in a matter of seconds. 

 This is a good way to collect your thoughts and also when the fish gently inhales the corn (they suck from the ground, it is really easy to unhook and carp dont have any spikes or teeth) they start moving away with it slowly, not thinking its a trap, and then when the line goes tight due to the tension between the weight u put on the line and the carps movement with the hook) the carp which is a very cautious fish bolts. If you were to tighten the 'drag' as it is called then the carps strength would be too great and your line would snap. It happens pretty often to me but the line is cheap. 

You also get an adrenaline rush from this. It's like anticipation anticipation then you see your rod which you laid down next to you twitch and the line bounce, and then you have to quickly grab the rod and lift it upward while the fish runs. I could have organized this better. Anyways with carp fishing it's unpredictable, if anyone is interested *ask questions in the comments and I'll give more info*. I definitely missed some parts.

Have a good day",07Jun2020,1
202,"Hi i'm a 19 year old male (turning 20 on the 14th) and at this point i'm reaching the end of myself.

This specifically regards my parents and family situation but its helpful that I lay down some framework for more help..

When I was younger I absolutely adored my mom. I relied on her for everything emotionally almost to a detriment. (My dad is still here and in the picture but I never really had a relationship with him due to the both of us being extremely different people, which usually resulted in fights and distancing myself from him) But most of those feelings changed once I found out I was gay (My whole family is extremely religious). I discretely asked my mother what she would do if she found out I was gay and she just outright said that she would ""pray for me"" and I found out later on once I turned 18 most likely kicked me out (its not entirely relevant to the problem i'm having so i'm going to leave it out to not make this longer than it needs to be).

After this I became as emotionally distant from her I could possibly be. Things got a little weird though when I tried coping with the situation with really weird situations I made up in my head. The gist of the situations would be me finding out I was adopted, or finding out that they had hated me from birth. Basically anything to not accept the truth that she would never love me for who I was. 

I've mostly been able to not think about her basically disowning me but I've noticed that i've been using said coping mechanism (making up scenarios to justify things) for other aspects of life, such as my friends. This has been making me unintentionally distance myself from them and i've been losing sleep thinking ""what if these were real? what if they were just lying so they can find something to use against me?"".

I really don't know what to do at this point. To an extent I do know that my friends care about me and want me to be happy in life but there is always this voice that keeps coming when i'm in bed telling me What ifs/They're lying and i' m getting sick of it",07Jun2020,1

206,"To start off, I already have depression and anxiety issues, so baseline I'm not too well-off as it is.

I'm in my late 30s. My sister is in her early-mid 30s. We are very close in a sense, although a lot of that is due to her being very dependent on me for support.  She had a rough childhood and went through some trauma. Problem is she never got it properly treated. She went off to college right out of high school and has been financially and emotionally dependent on my parents to some degree every day since then. My parents have never been good at dealing with her issues, and I blame them for not putting their foot down immediately, nipping it in the bud and telling her she needs to commit to long-term treatment/medications or she's cut off from their support. She pulls every excuse out of the book for why she won't/can't/doesn't want to/it's pointless/etc, and my parents give in. If my parents even begin to push back, my sister has a meltdown, yells, screams, fights, and tacitly implies that she will spiral and become suicidal. Consciously or subconsciously, she has learned to leverage her mental health issues, her suicidality, and the misery she can inflict on them to get what she wants

That has led to her being able to manage living in 12-5 different $1500-2000/month apartments in various expensive cities over the past decade and a half while almost never being employed full-time. She also does much of her grocery shopping at Whole Foods. Just to give you an idea of her relationship with money. She also relies on students loans- she's been in school most of her adult life and has a staggering, perverse amount of student debt.

Anyway, now that our parents are old, broke, and mentally broken, she's been turning to me more and more not just for emotional support (such as constant woe-is-me, I'm feeling so suicidal texts), but for financial support as well. Not nearly to the point that she's relied on our parents, but still too much. Any amount is too much. She's in school (again) with no job and no money and lives in an apartment that is much nicer than my own, as well as driving a nicer car (she came up with what I know is a bullshit excuse about it being the only car she could get), several new-ish Apple products, still shopping at Whole Foods, and so on. There's always some reason, some rationale, some excuse for why she can't do without them. She can't find a cheaper apartment because of \[insert bullshit excuses\]. She is just so divorced from reality, so emotionally fragile, and so obstinate that there is no getting through to her about it. I can kind of see why my parents have put up with it all these years. There is the unspoken but always present understanding that if you try to put her in her place, it will results in her spiraling and eventually us calling the cops because she's suicidal. It is a living hell dealing with her problems.

That isn't to say that she doesn't have very real, legitimate problems (health etc) that would be miserable for anyone to deal with, but she almost always refuses to make good faith efforts to deal with them herself. We're also convinced that some of her health problems are at least in part due to the immense stress she puts on herself from creating problems out of nothing through horrifically bad decision making. Instead she just inundates us with texts and calls about how miserable her life is,  constantly fights on the phone with our mother over crap that she should be dealing with on her own like an adult, and every time I get a text or my phone rings I get a pit in my stomach and my anxiety skyrockets. Sometimes I swear I would be much happier if she just disappeared completely out of my life for 5 years and reappeared as a normal, happy, well-adjusted *adult*.

How do you deal with a person like this? I'm coming close to telling her to just fuck off, but if she felt abandoned by me of all people, things would get worse than they've ever been and it would put our family through a hell that we just can't cope with.

Everythings gone downhill since I was 12.I was a strange infant rarely cried and always messed with wires and figuring things out.When I was about 2 I lived with this woman and she hated my dad so much that she'd take out this anger onto me since I looked like my dad.Hitting me,throwing me into dark rooms for hours for a whole year I endured this.

After a while my dad came back and took me but left my sister since my mother gave her legal guardianship to my sister and not me.
Things were the same I was hit by strangers I moved with my dad from house to house with his friends.after a while my mom came back into the country

But it didn't change I was used to this though while I didn't understand at the time.I knew I was misbehaving but they would hit me,if I would upset I would be told to ""fix my face"" if I got yelled at I was told to stop or they'd ""give me a real reason to cry"". Since my dad was a truck driver we were pretty poor I would be made fun of because I always wore big jeans and shirts so I could grow into them.

I got an Xbox as a gift but I could never use it either because we didn't have batteries or they couldn't afford a game.I'd spend hours in my room by myself sitting watching tv.I'm gifted as some would say always was a straight A student in elementary but people didn't know it was because if I even dropped to a 89 I'd be screamed at.

They'd accuse me of being lazy or not try.I never could go play with friends.I wouldn't be allowed out of their sight.I stopped feeling when I was in 5th I didn't care anymore and that's how I was until I got to middle school.

I had a complete mental shut down and was diagnosed with depression.I was passed around by counslers and sent to a mental hospital 5 times 3 out patient 2 inpatient.I want to go back it kept me out of school but they said if I returned it'd go on my record.

I argued with my dad back and forth I don't speak to him anymore.I have a little brother but I can't be the big brother he expects me to be. I don't care for school,career paths,friendships,nothing.I can barely express emotions,I'm always called a hallow person or school shooter

The only things I have left are my video games I bought and my girlfriend,but I screwed that up too.I called cps on her parents because I thought they were abusing her from what she told me that her parents do to her.

My ex started getting resentful, overly-critical towards me, and pushing me away about 2 years into our relationship. I tried to put in more effort to show I cared because I thought thats what she wanted, but then she broke up with me. Apparently she was under the impression I was going to break up with her instead. She said we could be friends but continued to treat me poorly. Eventually I tried to confront her about how she had been treating me but she acted like she didn't know what I was talking about. I snapped &amp; told her off and haven't spoken to her since. 

At this point I'm glad she's no longer in my life but it feels like my self-esteem has been put through a paper shredder. Most notably I feel like I'm not sure who I am any more. I question everything I do and I'm afraid I'm constantly being a jerk. I keep thinking about things she said like how I apparently “have problems perceiving reality” and “don't ever think about what message I'm sending to others.” Ironically she accused me of gaslighting her at one point when I'm pretty certain it was just a misunderstanding. She also claimed my apologies were just excuses and generally acted like she knew me better than I knew myself. Its like she kept trying to twist things around so I was the bad guy even though I only had good intentions, and now I can't stop questioning if I really am that terrible. 

I don't know. I've been considering therapy for a while but it feels like there's a lot of hoops to jump through, especially with the with the state of the world at the moment. I guess I'm just wondering if it's reasonable to feel  unsure of myself after all this?",07Jun2020,1

I always end up at the bottom of the social hierarchy, no matter what I do. I think I have autism. I don’t know when people are making fun of me/ being sarcastic/ I don’t know when and who to trust with what. 

I have tried various things, however I can’t keep up the act (even if it is successful initially) for long, I get super frustrated when I’m doing the act. I don’t think it is surprising or shocking that no one likes the “real” me but it blows me away how everyone seems to get on with each other so easily. I centrally don’t find it easy. 

I have friends, I think we are closer than we actually are though and this is something that gets me every time. I’d put them as my best friends but they would consider me on the edge of an acquaintance. 

Looking back there are many times I have overreacted to things although I don’t show it, all of my feelings and reactions are strictly private because I’m not sure if it is appropriate but I know it probably should be kept to myself. 

I feel I can’t share these feelings because We aren’t close enough and I feel it would push us apart more. I have tried many other ways spread out over time to improve things but have been unsuccessful, which impacts my self esteem greatly.

222,"This is a lot based on my own experiences with how not helpful therapy was for abuse.  I learned the templates for what a cognitive distortion looks like, but it's pretty clear that thoughts with the same pattern *can* be true.  And there didn't seem to be any real coherent way to tell the two apart.

The abuse I experienced is highly unrealistic.  I find in telling the story that, unless I *deliberately* frame my narrative in a way that draws parallels to more conventional abuse narratives, that the primary responses tend to be disbelief.  Something along the lines of ""that's bizarre"" or ""that can't be right"".  It's very common also to have other people try to retell or reframe my story in a way that seems to make more sense, even if their reframing is inconsistent with my memory or other evidence.  Or to accuse me of leaving something else or not telling the whole truth because the story doesn't sound right.

I'd note here that ""unrealistic"" doesn't necessarily mean exceptionally horrific.  It just means that the story doesn't fit with what people expect abuse to look like or what most people would consider probable.  In my case I would say it's largely because there doesn't seem to be any sensible motivation behind the abuse; a calm, collected abuser who gains no apparent sexual pleasure or external benefits from the abuse simply doesn't make sense to most people.  It doesn't make sense to me either.

But at this point, now that I'm an adult and have had a number of years *away* from therapy, it becomes clear that the events I remember did actually happen.  I still don't really have a good idea why.  But I'm faced with the choice that I either somehow fabricated a significant number of memories leading up to age 19 or so, or that a woman I have witnessed as an adult being abusive to others and shows a significant tendency towards narcissism and inability to get along with anyone else did in fact do what I remember.

Getting to the point of being able to do that has taken an amazing amount of work though.  And it's work that therapy fought every step of the way, labeling it as my defense mechanisms making me think something was there.  Encouraging me to focus on the nice things that my mother did (so as to not be discounting the positive) and to take her assertions of intent to help me at face value (otherwise it would be mindreading).  Basically generally labeling the whole process of trying to figure out if there was actually something to these improbable and unrealistic thoughts, rather than simply dismissing them, as a defense mechanism and unwillingness to change.

The only answer I ever got to how you tell the difference is to check with other people.  But that is, quite frankly, a terrible answer in situations like mine.  And most therapists I've found would avoid answering the question while pushing you to find and identify any thoughts that sound like the examples as distorted.

So how do we actually tell, as therapy clients?  And how, in mental health treatment, do we ensure we're not simply labeling people with unrealistic sounding experiences or communication struggles as having distorted thinking?",07Jun2020,1

I am thinking a lot of it is down to lack of confidence, I just don't have any confidence in myself, or courage. But then, it never used to seem like courage to me, it used to be just me and just something I did.

If you have been in a position like this, how are you doing? And what have you found helps?

224,"Hello
This whole thing is gonna be a mess, please understand I am writing this in a manic episode to attempt to make sense and find anyone who can understand anything I am trying to explain.




I am just a teen who lives in poverty in a household that drives me nuts as I'm untreated. I have diagnosed depression and PTSD, though they only figured that out after my last therapist brought up something my dad told her and I snapped at her. 

I always cover up what's really haunting me with a childhood trauma of mine. I was severely bullied for years and I had one dog that had been through it all with me. When my mom left us, after I was hospitalized, and when my first friend died. I went to my grandparents house in southern cali and that was the last time I ever saw her. I now live a life full of guilt for never saying goodbye and I always think that she must have been put down thinking I abandoned her like her last owner. It haunts me everyday and it's been five years. 

Back to where I say I use that to cover up my other trauma. I was the therapist friend to try to distract myself from my father's betrayal. In the process of being that friend, I now have the feeling of being a complete waste of a human because I couldn't save them no matter how hard I tried. I watched them die one by one. I  found three of their bodies and I now refuse to FaceTime people because the last person shot themselves on FaceTime because they thought that seeing them die and not be a burden to me would make me happier. I don't consider their act something they did for 'my sake', I've met people who think it meant good. I can't see how'd they'd ever think that. All of it was horrid and I myself am confused on how I still function and act like nothing wrong. Maybe it's because my current home says that people have it worse than me. Recently my best friend tried killing herself during class and I was never informed till I got a text weeks later saying they were back and on antidepressants. I was so confused and then I was hurt that all my friends wouldn't tell me. Their excuse was ""You already have enough hurt, I wouldn't want to add more. You seem stable now so it was best to wait"". Sorry if this whole post is a mess, but I'm having a really hard time coping and I'm very confused on how to function when my entire life feels like it's being controlled by my fear of reality.",07Jun2020,1

Current Diagnoses &amp; years I have had/known about them:
Depression 10
ADHD 5
Aspergers (ASD) 5
Insomnia 11+
Migraines 11+
Teeth grinding 8
Fatigue 10

Now add several injuries from mostly poor genetics, overuse from work, &amp; sports including 5 surgeries (6 will happen later this year). Etc. 

Over time as I learned more about my problems I have adjusted several things I say or do to get by even though I am set up to lose. As I have tried to educate employers, family, peers, potential partners &amp; I have found that the initial understanding, empathy, acknowledgment whatever you want to call it have eventually faded into annoyance &amp; intolerance. 

Given the lack of general knowledge surrounding mental health &amp; some injuries especially when they aren't as obvious as a broken leg I've found that people now resent me for problems I had little control over. My health has left me in debt, limited my ability to work for weeks with the surgeries &amp; doing leisure activities yet I'm seen as 'soft' 'self loathing.'

227,"I've always been a very quiet person, and I've never seen a doctor because of my mental health.


At school I was very shy and had only a few friends. I've been bullied a few times, but never been the most bullied kid in the class, I was very discreet and it didn't caught attention of my colleagues. I think I suffered the average amount of bullying for a boy during school.


Everything was fine at college, with few friends again.


I startet do work in my early 20s, and I feel that I'm become more socially awkward as I get older.


In my first job I started to feel that people were talking about me behind my back, about being a weird guy. And that was pretty bad to my self-esteem.


Now that I'm 30 and in my second job, it's been wonderful to be working from home because I can't stand my co-workers. They're always making fun of me and I pretend not to be upset. I must pretend very well because they keep going. Sometimes I make jokes as well, but it's nothing to make fun of somebody in particular. I don't know why they like to do that to me, when there are a lot of other people there. Maybe because I'm younger than them and I don't show that I'm upset.


The problem here is that I've been thinking that there's got to be something wrong with me to be perceived as a weirdo.


They even joked about me having autism one day. The only thing I know is that I'm extremely introverted and socially awkward.... and maybe it's not normal as I always thought.


what I hate the most about working from home are zoom meetings. I feel very uncomfortable being in front of a cam. At the beginning I kept it turned off, but every other person was using them and they started to encourage me to turn my camera on. In the next meetings I started to turn on my camera and I was starting to get used to it, but now I realized that they've been making fun of me, talking about my hair, the awkward faces I do during the meetings. And they talk about it in a group chat that I'm in. They don't ever do those kinds of stuff with anyone else, only me! Why me? I'm starting to believe that I am the problem.


If I said the same things about any of them, they'd probably laugh about it. That's why I don't blame them. They think they are just joking and that's ok, everyone is doing it.... 

I wish I wasn't so sensitive, some jokes from assholes are lowering my self-esteem and making me feel like shit. I'm trying to figure ouy what is my problem...

232,"So, today I was at a peaceful protest, and it was beautiful. There was chanting, speeches made by the arrangers and everybody kept their distance to each other. After 40 minutes, this protest disbanded and I and the friend that went to this protest, tagged along with a impromptu march that happened.

For 2 hours, we walked peacefully and everything was lovely, but then a group of young boys decided to mess it all up. They shot fireworks at us, attacked a journalist and then the police. I tried to stop them but they wouldn't listen, and they called me whore for protecting the ""bad guys"". They were later on peppersprayed. I left because the protest turned violent and I wasn't there to be violent.

It seemed like groups of people took advantage of the situation, and started looting stores, breaking windows and fighting the police. All I can see on the news are titles like ""BLM protestors loot stores and attack police,"" etc.

I feel sad, mad and actually guilty. I can't sleep because I feel like if I hadn't gone maybe I could have changed things. Maybe there wouldn't have been a fight. I know it's impossible for me to be the cause of this, as it was an outside gang of people, not part of the protest, that attacked us and the police, but I still feel like it is my fault.

Please, I don't understand what's going on and I'm on the verge of tears, although I should be happy I made it out without injuries. I feel horrible and the guilt is overwhelming. Is this normal?

I then sometimes even get obsessive, constantly checking their online status and seeing when they were last active on social media. I come to the conclusion they’re avoiding me and hate me and don’t want to talk to me anymore. They then respond a few hours later and I get happy and excited and forget my sadness. If they continue to stop responding I then I’ll cry for awhile before eventually becoming angry/annoyed and saying they weren’t even worth it.

- life goes on: so although i might need to allow myself / have no choice but to pause, external commitments continue to pile + i'm falling even further behind

That said, here I write this as letter, nothing but an attempt to help me getting out of this shithole I mentally feel stuck in. Tbh I feel like I just need to talk but I wouldn't feel comfortable to talk this stuff to anyone of my family or friends right now. Matter of fact, I try to never talk bad stuff to them because I just don't like to bring negativity to the people that I want to be happy, since everyone has their own struggles too and I usually try to not give them more issues to worry about. I'll try not to make this too long so that y'all don't waste too much time reading this. 

Right now I probably feel the worst I've ever felt in my whole life. Maybe not the peak worst, but I'm probably at my mental edge right now (I'm not sure if I made this part clear, sorry but I can't put it in better words). As of now my eyes are dry though. I lost my mother 5 years ago, she died from cancer. That was the peak worst, even though she was already battling it for 6 years and I was kind of prepared for that moment to come someday. Still an atrocious loss for a 12yo kid. Me and my father just didn't really recover from that. In fact I guess I recovered better than him. My father is the man I admire than most on Earth, but right now he's destroying himself, that's reflecting on me and I don't know how to handle it. He has become an alcoholic. He started a small business 3 years ago and met this woman that is part of our family nowadays. I really like her. He does as well, but he can't love her as a wife as much as he loved my mom (they were together for 21 years). As I said, he still hasn't overcome my mothers passing and he drinks to try to feel better. But I don't even think he feels better anymore, it has actually turned into an addiction. He just feels this compulsive need to drink. There's another problem: his business is performing bad. Never went as good as he projected and we are broke right now. The covid fucked us up financially too (because of the lockdown people can't hire his services anymore), fortunately our family didn't get the virus yet. Also, he shares ownership of this business with his new wife. So what happens is that he drinks and then comes home to fight (not physically) with her for absolutely no reason. And I can't tolerate this anymore. I've been witnessing this for so many years. Ever since my mother discovered her cancer he's been acting like this. But when I was a kid there was nothing I could do. Nowadays I can intervene since I'm as big as him and I'm able to defend myself or her if necessary. But that sucks. That's literally something I find unacceptable. A son should never even consider the possibility of needing to fight his own father, specially when he loves him. I've already talked to him multiple times the day after that type of stuff happens (it's been happening weekly recently, some weeks even more than once). But he never acknowledges that he's sick, that he's become an addict and that he needs help before another tragedy happens. 

And now all that shit has made me sick. My stress rates are off the charts and I'm frequently having anxiety crises. I feel like I've become sort of a bitter person, and I feel alone at the same time that my behavior pushes people away from me. My mind is full of negative thoughts. These latest weeks I feel like I'm really at the edge. He's drunk right now and will come home later today. Everytime he drinks I've been progressively feeling worse, it's almost as if any day I'm having a heart attack or something like that. Hope it doesn't happen today because I still want to stay alive. 

Well, I probably would have more to say but this already is way too long. In fact I don't even know if someone will read this. If you read all of it please just type anything in the comments or upvote this post to let me know. If possible, give me your point of view on my current situation on the comment section.

248,"I am really struggling. i am at a very very low point and although I know it is just a point and will Pass I cant see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

I am under extreme stress and anxiety and in a bit of a depression. I feel so low, hopeless, overwhelmed, crushed and also infuriated. I am also feeling just so painfully lonely and isolated atm. I have gone through a few periods like this (exams, grieving deaths ect) before. However, I don’t think it has ever really been this bad. 

I have been having panick attacks and sometimes wake up in the middle of the night in this INTENSE panick or stress. I can’t breathe and have the overwhelming feeling I feel doomed and also kind of with these concentrated bouts of rage? Idk how to explain it. I also get into panick attacks while trying to work/finish a project ect. I have never really had panick attacks or anything like that before (just a couple of occasions).

My physical health is also taking a toll. I have always been very athletic but with being stuck inside and feeling like I don’t have time to excercise I feel weak and stagnant. 

I am quite a critical person sometimes and am very perfectionist in the sense that everything has to be perfect but this is mostly directed towards myself. I’ve always been like this but it usually ends up with hurting myself or just being distraught one way or another. (Omg this is getting so depressing lol sorry!) idk I just hate myself more than I could put into words right now. I hate myself physically and have gotten very body-dysmorphic this quarantine and also just hate me as a person. I feel utterly unlovable. I know I’m young but I would love a girlfriend/boyfriend but I don’t see how anyone could really love me. I want it so bad but don’t see it happenifn. I feel like a failure and like my friends find me annoying ect. I’ve kind of tried to reach out about my struggling but feel like a burden. How is everybody else doing so ok? 

I have always LOVED food and turn to it when stressed or sad but I have actually completely lost my appetite for the last month. This has never really happened to me. I feel lightheaded dizzy and nauseous all the time. Sometimes I can’t even stand water. I have also lost quite a lot of weight in a worryingly short time. I have been getting headaches - sometimes very bad sometimes dull. 

I also cannot focus at all. I feel weak and my brain foggy. I can’t even really formulate my words well or how I use to. I will have to ask someone to repeat something over and over agin trying SO HARD to make my brain make it make sense. This has made school so difficult.

I am at an amazing but very competitive selective school and wanting to go to medical school. I have been struggling immensely with online school. On top of having a crazy amount of work there is the incredible pressure of the extra stuff you have to do for this career. I am just overloaded, very behind and just wondering how everyone else does it. 

I think i am going through a hard time mostly because of quarantine. I used to walk everywhere and travel to and from school everywhere. I loved school so much. I loved my friends. Now I just get out of bed, log onto my computer and sit in that room all day. I absolutely hate it. I feel stagnant, hopeless and useless. I don’t get the interaction or relief of my friends. There isn’t really a break. I miss my friends and just people my age so badly it hurts. I feel so lonely. I have actually gone out to see some people a few times but I wasn’t really myself and came back and fell into an extreme depression for and panick (for a couple of sm days) just ruminating on how I behaved and how I bet people don’t actually want to hang out with me and just embarrassed and angry at myself.

This time it was different. I opened the fridge and when I went to close it, I thought there was a hooded figure right next to me. I jumped and was definitely startled.

My morals and beliefs change so constantly that they might as well not exist. My sense of style goes from casual to preppy to punk to whatever I feel like wearing. I’m not truly passionate about anything. I couldn’t even begin to tell you what I enjoy doing. I’ve tried playing guitar, working out, sewing, hunting, art, and a thousand other things but nothing ever stuck.

My personality changes so often that I don’t even know how to describe myself. Sometimes I’m the smart student that everyone looks up to and other times I’m a lazy slob who spends all day smoking. Sometimes I’m quiet and reserved and other times I’m the center of attention. Sometimes I’m short tempered and violent and other times I’m compassionate. I feel “fake”

I’ve dedicated a lot of my time to school and make good grades, but now that I’m finally graduating, I’m realizing how much of my life I’ve wasted. I was never passionate about my schoolwork. It was just a means to an ends. I plan on attending college this fall but I have no idea what I want to study. I don’t know what kind of career I want. Again, there’s nothing that *really* interests me.

It’s all very frustrating. People always say “just be yourself” but I change so much that I have no sense of self. At first, I could ignore it, but these thoughts have been tearing me apart ever since quarantine. I’m never happy (I don’t even know what would make me happy) and I constantly feel unaccomplished.

A few years ago I saw a therapist that diagnosed me with depression and anxiety disorder, but I feel like this is something else.",07Jun2020,1
255,"We met when we were 11 years old. You became faster than I thought my best friend of all time. I felt like the happiest and luckiest girl in the world. We had never met but we were already talking about our first meeting in such a cute way. I thought of you every morning and evening on the way to school. And frankly I will continue for a long time. You were the only person who understood me at this time in my life. I realized that you were for a long time my only reason to get up in the morning because I knew I was going to log on my computer and talk to you.

Even today I look for your face on the subway platforms, at the corner of a street or even in schools. The scents of lavender that you loved so much that I find on my street mingle with too old memories of you. I have to stop there before talking about how the darkness would be a perfect backdrop to mix our silly laugh of terrible children. We both know how much our sighs and discussions could break through the calm night.

We were 14 years old. You abandoned me for no reason, I can't really open my heart anymore, I think about it again and again. I can't totally fix the hole you left me. 
Now I'm just so depressed and insecure. Fuck...",07Jun2020,1

257,I was diagnosed with DID (dissociative identity disorder) a few years ago but haven't really told anyone about until today when I told my friend and he didn't take it well. He said I was crazy and to never contact him again. There is a lot of stigma surrounding the disorder so I knew it would happen eventually but I didn't expect it to be the first person I told. It really upsets me since he was one of my closest friends. I'm kinda glad though because I don't want people who just leave like that in my life.,07Jun2020,1
