0,"*possible triggers ahead

I wasn't sure how else to word the title and I'm very uneasy going forward. For reference, I am 25F. 

I've likely had poor mental health for most of my living memory but have never seen a doctor formally for any of it. We were poor, living on welfare health insurance, and we received all of our medical treatment through my paternal grandfather, a pediatrician. Most health problems not immediately able to be solved with a simple prescription rarely were pursued further; I had to beg my grandmother to take me to the hospital when I fell down the stairs and couldn't walk on my left foot.

Last night really brought this to a head as I hid in a closet and cried, wishing I never existed. For curiosity's sake, and perhaps even mine, here are some of the things I struggle with:

- Possible depression. I spend most of my time at my computer chair. I'm usually not even actually doing anything. Just zoning out.

- Anxiousness to leave my apartment unless it's for work. Even then, I often call out and am currently facing disciplinary action because I so often just cannot bring myself to go into work and face people.

- I go through periods where I don't eat at all and periods where I overeat to the point of gaining weight. I likely had an ED at one point as I did nothing but eat soup twice a day and work out every possible moment I could but that was 4 years ago.

- Intrusive thoughts! This is absolutely my worst one and my main reason for posting this. Last night, in particular, I thought of every way I could kill myself within the hour despite sobbing, hiding in a closet and wishing I could think anything but those thoughts. It only stopped when my boyfriend came home, found me, and promptly gave me one of his prescribed Xanax.

- I have self harmed in the past. 

- Periods of disassociation (I think?) where I entirely space out and cannot focus on anything. My vision will blur as well and it feels like I'm not processing anything.

I don't know. Perhaps it's just nice to get some of this out but it's only a little bit of what I experience. The only medical professionals, outside of my job in the veterinary field, I know have been my grandpa and my gynecologist, whom is his friend. 

I'm so scared to get a name to what's happening to me. To who I am.",13Oct2020,1

2,"hey guys, 

i’m pretty confident in saying that all of us tend to be way too hard on ourselves. maybe you didn’t get that job you wanted, or you didn’t ace that test. maybe you’re stuck in bed all day, because the weight of the world feels crushing. 

but i made r/little_victories so we can all appreciate the little steps we take. taking a shower after a month of not being able to do so. eating a meal for the first time in days. those little things are so important, be proud of yourself for them ! 

if you got out of bed today, or even brushed your hair, or got a drink of water, someone’s proud of you. it’s me, and it should be you, too. 

so, if you wanna be a part of that space, i’d love to have you. r/little_victories could be a wonderful thing.",13Oct2020,1
3,I need to stop being such an open book. I have this thing called retroactive jealously which makes me constantly talk about my fiancé’s ex girlfriend. I’m really threaded by her even two years after dating him and this is because him and her were already dating for 4 months and broke up a few days or maybe a week before we hung out then we hung out twice and he said he wanted to work on himself and long story short she went around telling everyone they were back together a few days later and telling people she’s dating him but “still doing her” so needless to say i felt like i was getting pushed aside for someone who’s using and abusing him.. they broke up again and we hung out a few more times then he said the whole “i need to work on myself” again and by that point she heard about me through the grape vine and snapped her fingers and he went back to her and she loves the fact that he left me again for her and it really hurt my ego and really also hurt my feelings then they mutually broke up and she hopped on a new guy she started dating and he came back to me and i always felt like i was the second choice and it’s sucks cause two years later i still feel this way and still really resent this girl for humiliating me and resent him even alittle for not choosing me first and going back to someone toxic. He hasn’t done anything since then and definitely proved to me he’s all mine he never cheated and barely looks at other girls he’s perfect but I’ll still always be mad about it and it comes up all the time in my head and i bring it up to my friends a lot and they are sick of hearing this girls name and don’t get why I’m still so obsessive and disturbed by her i still look at her social media and constantly compare our looks and lives. Idk why I’m still so stuck on this girl and feeling like she took a “win” over me cause my fiancé liked her more then me at one point and she rubbed it in my face but i talk about it a lot and my friends think I’m psycho for it and i want to stop talking about it but doesn’t talking make it better? How do i block this girl out of my head !! I tried blocking her social media but it doesn’t work and on top of that she’s a known narcissist so she thinks she’s better and it pisses me off ugh i hate feeling worthless next to someone else.

4,"I just feel so alone and the only person I talk to is moving 6 hours away at the end of this school year and I don’t know what to do. I already never see him because he’s in a city about half an hour away and I don’t think I will ever see him again. He’s my only friend and I’m not sure if I can handle it. I don’t want him to move I really don’t but it’s going to happen anyway and I’m not prepared. I’ve already lost any friends I used to call close and don’t even talk to people in school. Everyone at my school hates me and it’s not better at home. The only time I feel good about myself is when we talk or play video games together. I know we will probably still talk as we already do use discord and text frequently, since I don’t see him in school. But I want to physically see him again and because of the rise in COVID cases and him just getting a job I don’t know if I’m going to be able to and I’m sorry for rambling but I just feel like complete shit about it. I’m literally so alone and This hasn’t been much of a problem until high school. I’m a dude in grade 10 and lost all my friends last year in grade 9. I met my best friend in January during a France exchange student thing and we went to France together in March (and actually almost got stuck because of COVID lol) but yeah you get it. I haven’t known him long but he’s the closest person I’ve been to in a VERY long time and he’s one of the first people I’ve trusted in a long time too. I’m just worried. I want to see him. I NEED to see him. But I’m so afraid, we will never see each other again. I’m sorry for rambling about some things that were off topic and such but like. Yeah.",13Oct2020,1

7,"So, I don't really know where to start so I'm just gonna start typing and see where it goes. So very recently I've had to move all the way from Las Vegas Nevada to Virginia. This fucking hurt me a lot, I already lack a lot of real life friends and now I have to move away from the ones I have again. Now I'm in Virginia in a tiny apartment and everything I wanted to do is delayed. I want to learn to play the guitar but its a little hard to do in an apartment, and I wanted to get back into drawing but school is fucking me over so much. Now I'm 17 and I don't know what to do anymore.

I feel emotionally starved, like I don't know how to talk to anyone, and I feel like a weirdo. I love my online friends, they are the best but I don't know what to do. I feel like I can't talk seriously to anyone. I have no one to talk to about how I feel about anything. Then when I do feel like talking to someone, I feel like I'm begging for something. Which I probably am I don't know. I feel like my entire life is stunted. For some reason I feel like this is all my fault, and I hate myself for it. I hate myself for fucking everything I do. I'm spending literally hours of my life thinking about how I could not be shit.

Now I find out my grandfather officially has dementia. My grandparents are one of the biggest influences in my life, their like a second set of parents for me.

She wasn't the problem, but she was the trigger.

2. She's filing to take me to court to hand me all my rights.

15,"This is a touchy subject for everyone. I'll try to be tactful.

Would anyone care to recommend a good book or website that covers to subject of memory loss and dissociation? Sometimes, during my time in the military, I... wasn't entirely present. I recall walking, not running, during one particular mortar attack and I can't remember why it made sense. I remember snapping out of it and running. There were other instances, too, and although I remember some of the events, I have trouble recalling the events in their entirety. I definitely don't recall the feelings.

Now, on a regular basis, I find I have trouble remembering events that took place a week or two ago. I'll ""confess"" a secret to my wife, only to be told, ""Darling, I love you, but you've told me all this before."" On the one hand, it's nice because it means she knows she can trust me. Apparently, I ""confess"" the same things over and over again, and nothing new is coming up. (I'm talking about little things, such as being upset with her, or wanting to yell at her, or forgetting a birthday.) Still, it does worry me.

I remember *how to do things*. I still remember the kata from my shodan exam. I remember how to strip and reassemble half a dozen weapons systems. I don't remember the last time I spoke to my best friend, or what we talked about, or what she does for a living. I remember my mother's birthday. I don't remember how old I am, but I remember my birthday. I have to do the arithmetic in my head, every time. I remember all sorts of traumatic events from my childhood, but I barely remember what happened in the military... other than *the* *terrible*, but I don't remember how I felt about it.

I'm vaguely aware that there are different types of memory, that some types are affected by emotional trauma/combat fatigue/whatnot (technically I'm a 100% disabled veteran with a PTSD diagnosis, but I prefer 'combat fatigue' because 'PTSD' is too f\*\*\*ing clinical), and so on. I just wish I knew where to start.

I would like to understand what's going on inside my own head. Why can I remember certain things but not other things? Why do I remember the *how* but not the *what* or the *how I felt about it*? Why do I have huge gaps in my memory? Why is it that certain memories cause my whole body to spasm as if to distract me from recalling them?

It's all very peculiar. I've been dealing with this for years; I'm ready to make a change; I'm signing up for [BetterHelp.com](https://BetterHelp.com); in the meantime, I wouldn't mind a book recommendation or a website recommendation.

18,"My best friend is struggling with paranoid schitzophrenia and I struggle to figure out the best way to get this person the proper help for the proper diagnosis and therapies.  A few years ago their family started to detect things were wrong as they became very accusatory of the family spying on my friend.  My friend is constantly hearing auditory voices of family members that are not audible to others. They relocated and while living alone, are still struggling with these same concerns of their home, workplace, and phone being bugged while they are being criticized by people who aren't around them at work and at home.   When I ask if it makes that their family would have any reason or desire to bug their home and phone or to plant devices to criticize them out loud, the only reply I get is ""no it doesn't make sense &amp; I don't know why.""   I have cautiously brought up that this could simply be a medical concern that could be addressed by the right team and that what is described sounds like schitzophrenia.  I have reminded my friend that I love them no matter what and believe what they are experiencing and am willing to do anything to walk by their side to help them get through this.  However, my friend is not willing to accept much conversation that this could be more of a mental health thing and is reliant that fact that their family are master spys with nothing better to do than to spy and degrade them at every turn.  My heart is broken and I have known this family for 30 years or so and have watched this beautiful spirit become wounded and hurt. This has gone on for a few years now.  I have tiptoed around the issue because it's quite a fragile topic.  It is making a massive impact on this person's daily work and social life.  I don't want my precious friend to feel like I am just another person out to hurt them so I walk this fine line. They have already isolated and I want to offer the best love and support that I can.

20,"this is my first reddit post, but the most important one. It's about my older brother, and I'm hoping someone can give me some advice or just redirection. I appreciate it truly :) 

He's 26 years old. I'll refer to him as C. I myself am 24, as is my twin brother T. Growing up, T  and I were always ambitious, passionate, and outspoken. I am in law school, T, medical school. My older brother C was always shy and quieter, never really had any significant ""passions"" or interests. He loved video games, did ""meh"" in school and seemed to always have friends. Not extroverted, but seemed to get by. He went to a big state school for college, my parents with my help basically filled out his applications. He probably would have been happy not applying, but he graduated just barely passing. We're unsure whether he ever was involved with any girls/guys, though he always made implications about ""having fun"" with girls. We don't know whether he just said them just to change the topic. 

Anyway, after graduation he moved back home. Every month my parents said that they would make him get a job or else he would have to ""start pulling his weight."" This hasn't happened nearly 4 years fast forward. He hasn't worked a day since college. He has gained a significant amount of weight. He doesn't leave his room. I lived about 30 minutes away after relocating for law school, and when I do stop by, he doesn't come out. The moment I saw him at one point, I couldn't even recognize my own brother. Any time I bring up C to my parents, my father gets angry at me, and my mother stares blankly, and just cries. They don't know what to do. They've never had a lot of money, and can't afford what a lot of people/doctors have recommended, which is living at some sort of rehabilitation center (not a hospital). C refuses to speak to a doctor/therapist even virtually. At one point this summer, a psychologist specializing in these types of cases came to our house and tried to lure C out just to talk. And C refused. This doctor said there is a chance he is on the spectrum, potentially Aspergers. Since then my mother has been quote ""talking to different people for advice."" Though she's been saying this for years. I even wrote a resume FOR him multiple times and was able to land him job interviews. Turns out, I discovered through the people I connected him with, he never showed up to the interviews (in person and remote) and ignored emails. 

Anyways, my parents seem to brush this under the rug day after day and year after year. Every year it's getting worse. It's not like he leaves his room to hang with friends, do drugs or something that shows interest. He has a phone and laptop, and I'm pretty sure from what I've gathered he is on NBA sports pages/fantasy leagues. He sleeps during the day and at night when my parents are asleep he gets food from the kitchen. I think my parents have ""taken away"" his laptop only once, and that didn't last long. They enable him for sure, and now use covid as the excuse for not kicking him out. They say that this would be the worst time to do that and they're afraid he would be happy on the streets.

I resent my parents for allowing this. But I also am all at once concerned about my older brother. Maybe he DOES have depression or a mental illness, but my parents lack of action is just allowing this all to get worse. I spent my birthday at my parents house, and he refused to come out. He does this every holiday, every day. It's just sad. This is more than just a ""failure to launch"" situation. He lives in his pajamas, doesn't interact with the human world. It doesn't feel healthy, and I can't imagine that my older brother is truly happy. 

I appreciate anyone who read all of this. It means the world, seriously! &lt;3",13Oct2020,1
21,"I’m sorry if this doesn’t belong but I’m really not sure where to ask. It’s very long, but all of the info here is important for understanding my predicament! Thanks for reading if you do!

I’m a minor and I have been diagnosed with ADD, dysthymia, and anxiety. My therapist says she believes I have severe depression, but I’m pretty sure I’m not actually diagnosed. Idk how that works tbh. 

I was recently put on Adderall and Citalopram. I also take clonidine for sleep. I haven’t taken the citalopram long enough for it to actually kick in (I’ve been on it for a little over a week, and it’s supposed to kick in in 4-6). The potential of me being bipolar has been discussed, so I was told if I experience suicidal thoughts I should alert my psychiatrist immediately to be safely taken off citalopram. 

I have not told my therapist, psychiatrist, or mother that I already experience suicidal thoughts (from time to time. It’s much better than it used to be and I never ever reach the point of creating anything similar to a plan) and that I am anorexic (sorry for saying it so plainly without even being diagnosed, but it’s just the truth). This is important, and it’ll be clear why as I go on. 

I recently (maybe two days ago? Three?) got up at 6 am to go to the restroom. On my way back to my room, I felt like I was going to pass out. This has happened before, when I’m sick I tend to get a fever that makes me pass out and throw up. After that, though, I’m better. I also have almost passed out after fasting on two occasions. I know what it feels like to pass out and the warning signs for me. 

So I rushed back to my bathroom and sat down. I don’t remember what order the following all occurred in, but this all is what happened: I experienced tightness in my back/ribs area and a lot of difficulty breathing. I vomited once. I felt numbness in my arms and mouth. All the while I was pretty close to passing out. 

After it passed (idk how long it lasted, but I’d bet it was under 10 minutes. Not certain though) I simply cleaned up and went to bed. The next morning I didn’t even feel sick, so I assumed it was a one off, either from being sick or having not eaten (although the latter was really unlikely because, like I said, I didn’t feel bad in the morning and I hadn’t been fasting for long). I didn’t tell my mom because I just didn’t see a point, especially since I thought it was just that I was sick. That being said, I don’t even remember having a fever. 

I told my mother about this tonight, as a result of what happened just today. I was hanging out with my friends in a pretty large city out of town. I was joking to them that I had had a heart attack, because of the numbness in my arms. We were doing a lot of walking, and I was feeling good. My arms started to feel a little numb after a little while, though, and it kind of just... stayed. Like throughout the rest of the day it was kind of just there. I was driving in this city as well, and as I got more stressed trying to traverse it my knees and calves started to feel a little numb too. 

Eventually, toward the end of the trip, as we were heading back to our town, I had a scary time trying to pull out of a parking lot onto a stupid busy highway. There’s extenuating circumstances, but the point is I pulled kind of recklessly (not really, don’t worry, I’m actually good at driving I promise) next to a cop and I was certain I was going to get popped. I’m not usually nervous of stuff like that, but I don’t know how to pull over on a highway like that and I had my friends with me (one of whom is really scared of cops) and so I was just really really stressed. Tbf, it was kind of stupid how stressed I was by it. 

After that, my cheeks and mouth were sort of numb ish. Especially my left cheek, it seemed, although that could be just because I tend to keep my right hand on the wheel and my left hand does everything else, including fixing my hair and resting my head against and such. Even now, my calves feel tingly and odd. I’ve been out of stressful traffic for ~4 hours. I even feel relaxed and stuff. 

Ok. So I started to think it was a stroke, because my mom had one. But after speaking with her I’m certain it’s not a stroke. She had a stress induced “mini-stroke” that caused her whole left side to go completely numb. It’s been years so she had regained basically all control, but her left hand doesn’t grip well and you can see a droop in her face when she’s tired and such. I think I would... probably be in a hospital if it were a stroke or heart attack. 

I told my mother all of what happened, and she believes it’s a panic attack. I’ve never had a panic attack before, and during the big bathroom episode I just didn’t really feel... panicked. Idk. I’m not completely sold on the panic attack idea. I had brought up to my mother, as well, that I’m doing really well lately. She said that sometimes panic attacks and stuff happen once all the difficult stuff is over. Something about “healing syndrome” or something. Idk. 

It wasn’t low blood pressure caused by the clonidine. I know this because I hadn’t even taken those that night. I’m hesitant to say it’s a result of taking adderall daily. I had taken adderall before, but not for as long as I have in a row, and I never experienced any of this. Also, it would have been out of my system, because I take the citalopram and adderall in the mornings, and the big bathroom thing happened at 6am, after I woke up. A whole day and night had passed. 

I’m just really confused. It doesn’t help that I can’t be super forthcoming with everyone, because... well it’s pretty obvious why I wouldn’t be open to talking about my eating habits. I really don’t know what to do. My mom said that if anything else happens I need to tell her and she’ll call the doctor immediately (the only reason she’s not calling him asap is because I asked her not to.) I really want to keep trying my medicine because I genuinely feel really good during the day now (yes, despite the eating thing) and I want to see how the citalopram affects me after the 4-6 weeks. 

Plus the psychiatrist is stressful. 

Sorry this is so long. There’s just a lot of variables. If any of you have any idea, I’d love to hear it. I’m not worried tbh, because I’m fine. The numbness doesn’t affect how I function in any way, and I haven’t had a fainting episode like that again. Even that wasn’t so bad. 

So yeah. Thanks so much for reading. Please let me know your thoughts. And sorry, but please don’t waste your time telling me to tell them all about the anorexia thing, because it simply won’t happen. Thanks again.",13Oct2020,1

25,"Hi, uh, so..
I'm 17, and I've been dealing with a relapse with suicidal ideation for around a month now. I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and I'm currently seeking a diagnosis for borderline personality disorder.

 I used to have a really really good support system, but currently all of my friends are dealing with their freshman years of college / their own suicidal issues. My best friend is super super busy with school and she doesnt even check instagram anymore because she's so busy trying to finish her 16 credit premed semester with a 4.00. This applies to almost all of my friends bc they're all fucking geniuses.  

And my girlfriend is currently dealing with a psychotic depressive episode, so I can't exactly unload all of my shit on her when she's in a much worse situation and the suicidal stuff triggers her. I love her, like I genuinely do, so I can't even think about worrying her like this.

The only thing keeping me here is the fact that my dog wouldn't know what happened when I didn't come back home. I've been in college for almost three years now, studying chemical engineering.

26,Lately I have been trying to start some new hobby’s but I found it very difficult because I’m constantly thinking about what others think of me and how all my friend would hate me if I started these hobbies. I’m constantly scared and only when I distract myself can I get rid of these thoughts. These thoughts always mess with me and even sometimes bring we so far down as to want to quit the hobby. I know people will sometimes say “there will always be people who hate you no matter who you are so doing this won’t change much” but I can never shake the thought of how others view me. I want to enjoy these hobbies because after all they are hobbies but my mind will never rest and I’m constantly in fear. Sometimes I will try to hide the things I’m doing so nobody can find out so they can’t judge me even though I know they would never search my phone in the first place. But as soon as I get a positive look on the hobbies a new thought comes in and destroys my positivity by saying some like “ You know everybody is gonna hate you for this” or “If you start doing this your going to lose all your friends”. These thoughts make me questions where I stand with my friends and if everything I do I just do has been a lie to myself. These thoughts make me scared to go to school because I know at school they are unavoidable and I will be stuck with them for hours which could leave me feeling broken and depressed. A major problem I have is my school does a weird schedule type of thing and every other day I will not see my friends at all. I feel like I need to constantly be doing something with my friend because they can help distract me from these thoughts. As more and more time passes it seems like it is getting worse. I’m way to afraid to tell anybody because I’m worried they might not believe me or just laugh at me and say stop overreacting. I just want to get these thoughts out so I can start some new hobby’s and enjoy them as well. What should I do?,13Oct2020,1

He was even buried at the church's cemetery where we went to church together I have to pass by it every day to just leave home I really just miss him and wish he was still on earth.

I've been back at my parent's house and saving up money since quarantine. However, I dreaded coming back home because for the past several months I had been seeing a therapist and processing deep childhood trauma from my dad, who has a history of being verbally and mentally abusive. I wasn't ready to see family again because I hadn't finished healing and was in a vulnerable state of mind.

I've been able to adjust to family life again, but it's not exactly normal either. I can't stand being in the same room alone with my dad for more than ten seconds and haven't eaten together at the dinner table since I've been back. I don't plan to because it's what keeps the peace. My family members act like everything is fine, but this just makes me feel even angrier and invalidated. It's painful to hear his voice and how he tries to joke around as if I've moved past the abusive incidents. I may be wrong, but it seems like a gas lighting tactic and so I don't respond. I don't want to give him any ideas

The avoidance has minimized any chance of conflict, but whenever he has an outburst, his anger somehow finds it's way towards me. The most recent incident was when he was furious at my mom for setting dinner 30 mins late and started slamming his door (to deliberately frighten me since our rooms are next to each other) and hitting the vacuum at my door for a couple days. My younger brother was involved and was told not to talk or associate with me, even though I had nothing to do with the dinner conflict between my parents. Out of fear, my brother complied and communicated with me only via text for a week.

There have been countless instances in the past, some even more severe than this case. Last summer, when I was moving to a new apartment while my parents were filing important paperwork, my mom had been making a lot of mistakes with errands due to all the chaos. As that anger slowly built up in my dad, I stood up for my mom to deflect the anger (she suffers from high blood pressure and risks having a stroke under high stress). He snapped and started using vile language as we were driving for an hour and I ended up recording this incident on video (only five minutes). This was the first time I ever had tangible proof of the abuse my family and I have been experiencing for years. In the video, he tells my mom to shut up when she tries to defend me and continues to curse me out and frame the situation in a narrative that made him the victim.

I understand why my mom and brother have a hard time speaking up. My mother spent the last twenty years defending my brother and I, and now is too tired and old to take part in quarrels due to her health. My brother recognizes my dad's negative behavior, but is laying low. I'm a lot more confrontational and have reached my limit and am planning to start my healing journey once again. Every time I hear his voice or find myself in the middle of an outburst, I feel myself regress back into a terrified little kid again. The last time I was in therapy, i was showing symptoms of ptsd. It's been a disheartening to tell my trusted mom and brother about this and gain a silent nod because saying it out loud would bring it into reality. They seem to be in denial as well, maybe because recognizing my own healing will require them to break out of their bubble. However, I no longer want to deny my experience because clearly it's been a pattern of abuse. Keeping busy has helped distract from complicated emotions for now, but I will have to process them eventually and i'm terrified. I can already see the struggles i will face once I start to further unravel my truth.

There are many underlying themes in my dad of misogyny, insecurity, and some deeply rooted trauma that he has never been able to recognize in himself which has accumulated to this type of behavior. I've tried as much as I could from holding family discussions and even gathering stories from relatives to figure out what happened in the family tree that went so wrong when it came to my dad. However, conversations only ended in the blame and I ended up leaving the table with more grudges than when I started. My extended family either do not know of the situation or are aware and pretend not to know, but their advice indicates that they care more for my dad than they do the rest of my family. After all, my dad is the treasured, youngest sibling out of five sisters. Alongside, his obvious favoritism of my brother, as well as from what I can assume, hatred towards women based on his sexist remarks, makes it nearly impossible to expect anything from my dad. He does not deserve my forgiveness and has lost my trust completely. Any healthy relationship requires effort from both sides and he has not proven himself to be capable of such, especially as a parent. As hopeless as it may seem at the moment, all I can do is to work towards breaking this generational curse, even if it takes me a lifetime.

I also suffer from self harm and am trying to get better. My mental health isnt the best and topics like these can trigger me especially if im not warned. She knew this yet she still said it. I told her Im not comfortable talking about this as it triggered me and that I was sorry. She then proceeded to say the reason she relapsed was because someone triggered her. Again I was shocked as if it triggered her why would she tell me without any warning. I told her that I couldn’t talk to her again about the topic at the moment and waked away.

36,"So I don’t know if I have depression, ADHD, or am bipolar. I seem to have a mix of the symptoms from each of these.

On the other hand sometimes I have tons of energy however this is usually short lasted I think the sadness has been more prominent lately.

40,"I know there is something wrong with me, I want to fix it but don't know how. I've contacted a service in my country where children under 18 can get psychological counseling but they have not reached out to me after 2 months. I feel like I want to die, I have family that would be crushed if I ended my life so don't worry, I will not do that. But if I could choose to have never been born, I would. I will try to make this as systematic and error-free as I can, but I do have dyslexia, so some errors are unavoidable. I'm probably going to show this post to my therapist if I ever hear back from them. 

 

My childhood:

Ever since my mom took me and my sister away from our father when I was 7 I've had issues making friends. For the most part, I've isolated myself with videogames and cheap entertainment. In total to this day, I have moved 10 times before turning 17 years old. 3 of which were from group homes. I guess there are multiple reasons why I ended up in the ""system"". 

I was bullied on some of the schools I went to. Back then I never understood why, I've later been told that there is something me that just makes me an easy target. It's kind of fascinating, in every grope I've been in I was always the butt of the joke. I've not yet been able to pinpoint what makes me this easy of a target.

Even though I isolated myself a lot I was lucky and made some friends in some of the places I lived in. Other than that, I'd almost say I raised myself. Back then: I would spend a minimum of 10 hours every day in front of the computer. Due to this, I ended up losing interest in school around 8th grade, didn't even last till Christmas break before pretty much dropped out. Since there is a law in Norway that says that all children must finish 10th grade I was moved to a special needs school. It's around this time I was diagnosed with Aspergers, a diagnosis I believe to be wrong. That hardly matters though.

I also suffered a lot of stress from home. I do love my mom and have a great relationship with her now, but she tends to overlook all of her own problems and blame everyone else when bad things happen around her, everyone in her family was like that. I think I was 12 when my grandmother told me that if my mom ever killed herself it would be my fault for being a shitty kid. I grew more and more frustrated with my situation and after a while, I could not take it anymore. I think it was right before my 14th birthday. I had a breakdown where I punched my door down and repeatedly shouted ""I want to die if there is a god please kill me."" after a fight with my mom. Since then I've lived to what I believe to be the equivalent to grope homes. Essentially, it's a home for teenagers who can't live with their parents. There was always 1 adult for every teen in the house. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently:

In my first year of upper secondary school, I was a kid with lacking social skills and a need for approval I ended up being a massive show off this year, which didn't really help me fit in. Despite this, I managed to make a friend. I did learn a lot from hanging out with her and I'm grateful for that. Even got to know some of her other friends. I did not like that she was so clingy to me though. She made a lot of physical contact with me, something I said to her I was not comfortable with, it left me really confused about my feelings towards her since I was deprived of attention. She also tended to harm herself and that she had an envelope with a razor blade she was going to kill herself with. I really wanted to help her, I guess that's why I stayed with her for so long. I cut ties with her after the semester was over.

&amp;#x200B;

My problems:

This year, my second year of upper secondary school has been a lot better. I really like the subject that I'm taking (Information and communication technology). My class is nice, I've gotten a few new friends that I like, I've moved into my own apartment that I keep clean and I work out 3 times a week. Physically I have everything I could ever want, but I still struggle. I keep thinking that people (even my friends) are lying to me and that they don't really like me, I struggle to meet new people, and I still feel lonely and sad. I know it's irrational. A few days ago, I started talking to a girl over facetime. I really like her; I know she likes me. And to be honest, I can't remember last time I felt as happy as I've been the last couple of days. But after falling asleep over the call with her; tonight, I woke up after 2 hours and was just filled with sadness. When I tried to fall asleep again, I'd feel so fucking sad that it hurt. I have no idea what is going on.",13Oct2020,1

Seems like my opening up to my family has inspired them to fulfill my schizophrenic delusions. It is a narcissistic family after all, I never should have trusted them. I'm the whipping boy

My symptoms have improved since then, however, my younger brother and dad have started to use this knowledge to try to trigger me.

46,"Hi, this is random of me for to bring an issue to a public board, yet something like this is stumping me.

Recently my sister and my family have parted ways, and it serves as a massive mystery, not only to me, but to my family as well. 

For a little context, my sister has recently decided to make erratic decisions and make horrible choices with her life, and it all stems from a time period of three weeks ago, when she met her current boyfriend, who she lives with now. 

After my sister met this guy, per stated, she had made horrible decisions, such as lying, stopping college, abusing medication, etc. 

To get to the point, my sister after meeting this guy did all of that, and one night she lied about going to an event, stayed over at this guys house, and skipped work. My parents told her to come home, yet she refused, and my parents got angry after telling her to and took her stuff and basically packed it up, and my sister showed up 3-4 hours after. Then she took her stuff, left, and then I had a talk with her.

She didn't seem like herself, like the best way to describe it was talking to a shell of who she was. She wanted to leave, too, she had all of her pets here, and didn't want to stay, she didn't say she wanted to stay either.

-My mom (sometimes) points out too many mistakes on how I do things and asks me to do chores and that frustrates me even more bc it's even more plain to see that I don't organize myself in a decent way or concentrate enough in my tasks

48,"I (25/F) am moving halfway across the country in a short 2-3 months after living at my parents full time for the last 7 months (thanks COVID). It is very contingent on a few underlying factors whether I will be getting my own place immediately or moving into a loved ones home until I get established in a new coast. I have dreamt of this day for a solid year to two years as I was working for an awful company and living partially in my car and partially at my parents (2.5 hrs away from work) for 2 whole years. It wasn’t ideal but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. 

Anyways, I began to pack in preparation for the move (I tend to prepare too far in advance sometimes, just how I am). And as I began doing that, my adhd, anxiety and depression all came running at me at once. I have usually battled these all separately and been successful at keeping them at bay. But this is a whole new set of issues I haven’t quite dealt with before and I have no idea how to handle them. There is absolutely no part of me that wants to stay here (for now) but my parents are my absolute best friends and I have irrational fears of them getting into crazy accidents when I do head off. I know deep down it’ll all be fine, but I have never lived more than 4.5 hrs away and I somehow managed to trigger my very irrational fears today. And on top of that, moving during a pandemic just sounds insane but where I currently reside, there is absolutely no hope for a future career..

It honestly freaked me out more and sent me down another spiral before calling my therapist. 

I have friends who do suffer from depression and anxiety. And sometimes the only thing you can do for them is to refer them to get help, because as a friend, you are not a therapist or psychologist. The best thing you can do is help them find help. But I don't necessarily want to refer someone who is going through a hard time to something that did not help me while I was in that situation.

53,"I've just come back from my therapist that I've seen 3 times now. I tried talking to her about me having Asperger's or autism and she didn't even try to see if I have it. Just straight to saying I have low moods and should be taking my antidepressants.

This is my 10th therapist. My 9th therapist has been my best but he wasn't qualified for the trauma I have.

I'm feeling absolutely hopeless. I don't even want to take antidepressants. I honestly don't feel I need to. I just want someone qualified to talk to me and help understand why I feel the way I do. But I just get told the same things I've been told since I was 8 years old..

Eat better, exercise, sleep, find a hobby to do, take medicine. It doesn't help and it hasn't been helping for years now. At this point I'm probably just as qualified of a therapist as the one I'm seeing now. 

I honestly don't know what to do. I just feel so fucking bad after seeing my therapist. I feel super misunderstood. 

I don't know, sorry I just really needed to vent. I've told so many people that they should therapy a try but I'm giving up on it myself. Idk",13Oct2020,1
54,"The other redditor said the following:

""I'm a psychotherapist and Borderline Personality disorders is one of my specialties. One of my professors is a top therapist in the area of personality disorders. 

Also, THE BEST person to read about it is Theodore Millon. He goes beyond regular diagnosis and noticed several subtypes of all the personality disorder, which are worth reading about. 

Also, you do not ""have"" BPD because it's not a ""thing"" but rather a state of mind. Your personality is based on ideas that you believe in that shape how you think and act. 

The good thing is that the same things play out over and over, and that's why certain events produce the same kind of people. Typically, abused children turn into Borderlines. 

The syndrome is, in a nutshell, that Borderlines hate people. That's the core thing going on. They like to attract people and then hurt them. That recreates the abuse they experienced. They also like to tease people, typically with love, sex, excitement, then hurt them until they flip out. Once that happens they can accuse their victim of being the bad guy. He's a psycho! He's a stalker! In fact, you set all of that up to make him into that. 

That's the core hate at work. 

I equate Borderlines with vampires. The classic vampire is good looking, rich, sexy, exciting, charming, etc and then they drain your life. 

In Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, a Borderline is seen as having ""Black and White"" thinking, which means everything is extreme. That thinking triggers extreme mood swings. 

So, the goal is to look at the ""gray areas"" in life. 

You would meet me and go ""He's a handsome genius and humanitarian!!!"" and get all changed up. But, when I said one wrong thing, maybe had something in my nose, etc then I'm a gross, fake, stupid jerk. That's how Borderlines think. 

The way out of that is to start telling yourself that no person is all or nothing. We are a mix of good and bad things. A person may love you, or just like you, or not much, or hate you. Tomorrow, they might want to be your best friend. You don't know but you can know there is no 100% anything kind of person.

If you go on a date, you are sitting there hating the person. You are tuning them out, you aren't really on a date with them, you're on a date with yourself. Instead, try BEING ON A DATE. That means you aren't getting married or getting divorced on the date. You are with another person and the date should be fun and it is a moment in time to enjoy. 

Borderlines RUIN EVERYTHING FUN due to their hate. So, confront yourself about it. No one is perfect, everyone makes mistakes, and you don't have to commit to extreme relationships just getting to know someone. 

On a side note, nearly every Borderline female I know dates scumbags. That's so they can constantly be disappointing. I am telling you to be open minded about people but DO NOT BE OPEN MINDED about scumbags. That will only help to recreate past trauma. 

A Borderline needs a soldier type to date and by that I mean someone who doesn't lie much, genuinely likes you, does good things for work/school, and doesn't have substance abuse issues. If you do what I say and not find petty faults with this kind of guy, things will go well because a person like that can heal beliefs that people are bad and kill your hate.""

I feel like their response is putting myself and others that have similar issues into a box and saying we're all the same and not individuals with different thought processes. I feel like they're telling me that I'm a shitty person at my core n to suck it up n deal with it. It's like they're projecting on me saying I'll ruin everything I touch and only hurt those around me and deserve scummy people while discrediting the good, wonderful people I have dated who just didn't work out.

57,"# ""Hi,  so I really didn't have anywhere else to turn and have been lurking on  reddit for some time without ever commenting, but I guess I thought this  was of good a place as any to start. I've been thinking, for a while  now, that there may be something slightly wrong with me, mental health  wise but also don't want to seem like I am just complaining to people,  so if anyone here could help me out that would be great. So just some  general background, I am a 20 year old female just finished my freshmen  year of college on track for an accounting/finance degree, older sister  who I am close with, mother, father, middle class. I guess I have the  typical myriad of problems for that background including parents that  probably should've gotten a divorce by now, a father who I love and is  one of my idols, but who also seems to be a tad bit alcohol dependent  which imbues a certain amount of sadness in me to see him so unhappy in  his life that he is driven to that. My mother had a very rough childhood  with a mother of her own that was very cruel to her, and because of  this she tends to be what some of my friends describe as ""emotionally  abusive."" Basically my sister and I never knew what mood she was going  to be in when we got home and she tends to fly off the handle at the  tiniest of things. Lots of times she has told me she is leaving because  no one loves her or appreciates her and then when we do the whole dance  of me telling her that I love her and her saying she doesn't believe.  Recently she threw in a fun twist by saying she knows I don't love her  because she read a passage in my middle school journal that said I hated  her. I responded that that was years ago and everyone ""hates"" their mom  when they are that age, though if I remember the passage correctly it  was in relation to her kicking a fan across our kitchen and then yelling  at me and my sister in the middle of church leading us to leave Mass  crying (I should say that my mom does a lot for me and I genuinely do  love her and feel horrible that she is so unhappy in her life, in fact I  think a lot of my sadness comes from the feeling that my parents are  unhappy). But really, none of that is the problem, that's just life and I  think I am fine with that. More to the point, ever since going to  college I have noticed that I react differently to things. I seem to be,  in general more anxious, and if I am worried about something it is  almost impossible to take my mind off it. For example a couple of my  friends and I were caught in a room with alcohol (alcohol that we  weren't even drinking, I know shocking for a college student, but we had  already done it somewhere else) and I had what I am pretty sure is a  panic attack and something I've had multiple times. My heart started  pounding and I couldn't breath and I was so incredibly dizzy and it felt  like the world was collapsing in on itself and I was seeing in a tunnel  vision of colors and I felt like I was going crazy(ergh I hate even  typing it out, it makes me feel like I am relapsing). My friends took me  into my room and laid on my bed reciting this piece from a poem that  usually calms me and after a while it wore off but I was still extremely  worried and anxious about getting written up and having a conduct  meeting. For the next few days all of my friends seemed to accept it but  it was all I could think about. Some of my friends brought up how it  was weird that I was basically chanting and they friendly teased me  about it which led me to do some self reflection. I realized that while I  don't have full blown panic attacks too often, I do have minor cases of  extreme anxiety where my chest is pounding and there are tears welling  in my eyes and an immense feeling of dread and heaviness in my heart.  These are mostly triggered by downward spirals of worry such as when  taking a math test in which I don't know anything and I'll start  thinking about failing and how then I am going to get a C in the course  and it will lower my overall gpa and then I will never get a good job  and my life will be over blah blah blah. They are kind of like mini  panic attacks but usually happen in a public place where it typically  wouldn't be socially acceptable to have a complete and utter mental  breakdown such as tennis practice or a memorial day assembly. I also  have a lot of irrational fears, like whenever I swim in open natural  water I feel like there is a dead body floating underneath me (weird I  know, I think it comes from an article I read once about a dead body  being in a pool for THREE operational days before anyone noticed), or  sometimes when I am turning a corner I will feel like there is going to  be a dead body or like a creature waiting to take me away there. I'll  know in my head that it's irrational and will tell my body so, but it  still feels real. I also sometimes experience overwhelming feelings of  dread seemingly out of nowhere for no apparent reason. In high school I  had a couple bouts of derealization in which I would feel like I was on a  movie set, or like I was seeing everything through a lens. These became  a lot more frequent the second semester of my freshmen year of college  after my sister was raped (we go to the same school, as I  said earlier we are rather close) and she basically told almost no one  including my parents so I was left with the brunt of helping her through  it, which led to tremendous guilt when I couldn't be with her 24/7,  confusion when she started getting very depressed and not acting like  herself, being torn when my parents would ask me what was wrong with her  and wanting to get her the help she needs but not wanting to betray her  (also it would destroy my parents, which I think is one of the reasons  she didn't tell them in the first place), and a lot of drunken crying  fits in showers. But I started to notice that for the first time in my  life I did not really care about my school work as I found it rather  trivial (which in all fairness it was #geneds), and I would often  experience bouts of derealization and disconnectedness with the world  around me. I guess I am just kind of tired. And I would like my brain to  just stop, but it never does and sometimes I think the weight is  crushing me and I can't breath, looking back on it I think I have always  been an anxious person. I've always been very empathetic and took on  other peoples emotions, my parents favorite story of me is of this one  week in 2nd grade when they thought I was lactose intolerant because I  was experiencing immense stomach aches, but it turns out I just had a  teacher who yelled a lot, not at me but other kids. And in the meeting  we all had I guess they were like that teacher loves you and thinks you  are a doll, she never is mean to you, and I was like ""yeah but what  about all the other kids she's mean to, that hurts more."" Which I guess  they thought was funny, and kind of is. But the caring has gotten to the  point of excessive worry about everyone and everything around me and I  don't know how to shut it off. My sister never understood growing up how  much it hurts when my mother favors me over her(fun fact, one time when  she thought she was dying, my mother asked me if I wanted her to just  leave everything to me and nothing to my sister), and when I tried to  explain to her how I feel what everyone else is feeling and I can't just  shut it off she told me that wasn't a thing, which led me to believe  maybe that has something rooted in anxiety too. I guess this has been  long enough, probably too long for anyone to comment on which is  completely understandable. But if someone does happen to read this and  have any insight on whether this might somehow be an anxiety disorder,  or I if am just being a pussy, please let me know. Honestly it feels  better to even just write some of it down, so thanks, reddit.""

I wrote this a couple years back and never really got any answers but some of these situations have been flaring up again. I went to a therapist a little less than a year but he wasn't much help as he was just on his phone the whole time. Sometimes I would ask him if what I just told him was normal or maybe caused by some sort of mental health issue but he would kinda stammer around the question because he hadn't been listening to the things I had just said. I guess I'm just kinda at a loss. Sometimes I feel like the world isn't even real, I feel such a distance between myself and reality, like I'm observing life through paned glass. I have somewhat frequent panic attacks and also just operate on a daily basis with a tightness in my chest. Sometimes I feel like there is so much anxiety in my body that I can't get it out, it hums along my nerves like electricity. I feel as if I am being shocked and there is a current running through me. Sometimes when I feel really out of it and separated from the world I'll burn myself and the pain grounds me and feels good. I would never kill myself because my cousin killed himself before I was born and I've seen the long term affects that has on a family. But sometimes I do want to die just so I don't have to feel this way anymore and slog through endless days when I'm on the fence whether or not life is worth it. I just wish someone would tell me that there's something wrong with me and that there's a way to fix it. I feel like my whole life I've just been complaining. My family is very Irish and comes from the school of thought of where its just like ""take a walk it'll make you feel better"" and then never talk about the bad things again. My dads progressed to a full blown alcoholic by this point no matter how many times me and my sister ask him to stop. I know he's really unhappy, I love him so much and it devastates me that he's so unhappy. My whole life I've felt haunted. It's a running joke in my family and with my friends at how much of a fraidy cat I am. How I'll be spooked by things that aren't there. I can be laying in my bed and have the feeling that something bad is outside my door. I'll know logically in my mind that it isn't true, but that doesn't stop my body and my feelings from believing there's something out there. I guess I just really need to know if something is wrong with me, or if this is just how life is for everybody and maybe I'm just not tough enough to deal with it. Any help would be more than appreciated, even if it's just to say to stop whining.

60,"DISCLAIMER:  
I avoid writing things like this constantly because I really do feel like a nuisance to others. As well as not wanting to be thought of as just ""attention seeking"" but I really need to get my thoughts out somewhere. (Everything I write here is the truth and I am in no way embellishing anything for sympathy) 

CURRENT SITUATION:  
I'm 18, somehow graduated from high school last school year with a 1.95 GPA due to online school being horrible for me and an extended mental hospital stay throughout the first half of the year. I was actually accepted into a computer science program at a local community college but dropped everything because I cant do schoolwork from home due to really bad living situations for focusing on anything. I've applied to about 8 local jobs (everything I was qualified for) and gotten 1 interview where I was rejected before even finishing, others haven't called back. Anger and depression basically run my life as it is right now, and I'm only awake for about 6 hours a day unless I actually have something important which is rare.   


BUILD-UP:  
What I think built up to all this culminating for me right now is the lack of growth I've had in pretty much every aspect of my life. I really thought once I got to high school it would be a new start for me, unfortunately It was the same district so I really just kept my reputation as the ""stupid"" kid who is funny to laugh at from middle school. Which sucked but I was used to it of course, after dealing with it for 5 years at that point. I did have one friend I met through a mom's friend at work, he was really cool until he got other friends and ended up being busted with drugs and eventually falling into some police involvement. So I couldn't hang around with him anymore even if I wanted to. Since this point I have had no real friends and I feel I'm partly to blame due to my reclusiveness for the last 2 years of high school mainly because I just gave up on fixing my image.  


MENTAL HEALTH:  
I've been brought to the Emergency Mental Health section of the emergency room 3 times now. First time was as a referral from my school guidance counselor and I was put in a partial program where I went 6 hours a day instead of school to sit in a group and talk about issues I didn't want other kids my age to know about so I stayed relatively quiet the entire time considering we had no 1-on-1 time ever. The second time I was brought to the ER, I was there for 17 hours until they just had me sign some papers saying I wouldn't hurt myself and was free to leave. At that point all I wanted to do was leave honestly, it was excruciating wait times. The third time I went to the ER, I was admitted to a mental health facility upstate for a while. Which also didn't help but rather scarred me to the point of not wanting to talk about my mental health ever again with professionals. I do have a doctor I speak with every month or so but ever since Covid-19 its only video calls where I'm only really asked basic questions, then asked if I need more prescriptions for my medication and sent off. (These only last about 30 minutes and are truly worthless to me)   


IN CONCLUSION:   
I'm not sure where to go in life. I'm unenrolled from college, No one will hire me, Depression gets at me everyday because of lack of social communication and a feeling of worthlessness and inability to open up about anything without a fear of being criticized or being sent back to a mental hospital, and most importantly I just need some sort of purpose. I have no hobbies anymore since video games became boring, maybe I just need friends which in turn may give some motivation but that's not happening during a global pandemic which has seriously crippled my ability to progress in life in multiple ways.

65,"this is mostly a vent but advice is very welcome because i am very very lost on where to go from here and my mental health is taking a huge toll.

so basically i am on twitter a lot, and have been for the last couple of years, and earlier this year, i made friends with my other friend's ex. the importance of her being the ex is that she messaged me looking for advice since i knew the person she was dating the most out of anyone. we bonded really fast, i gave her advice and listened to her and just tried to \~be there for her\~ and it was absolutely fine!.... until i hurt her feelings later that month. we were still learning boundaries so i ended up making a joke that she didn't take kindly too (understandably) and she just... went offline for the night, no response or anything except she messaged my girlfriend saying i hurt her feelings. anyway the next day she finally messaged me and we talked about it and i apologized and then everything went back to normal. 

fast forward a few more months and it's still going great and then.. i hurt her feelings again. but this time, the reason she gets upset is a little less reasonable (in my opinion). for context, we live across the world from each other, and i had woken up early that day to talk to her extra hours because usually she sleeps by the time i'm awake.... well it was almost noon and i was asked to go get some groceries by my mom and so i told her that i had a few errands to run and so i might need to say goodnight to her SOON and she did the exact same thing as before. she just. goes silent and eventually i get a message saying ""fine goodnight."" i suppose i understand where me leaving would be upsetting, especially if she was having fun but she has to randomly leave in the middle of us talking almost every day so it rly?? confused me?? that i was getting backlash for that. anyway i have to apologize for that as well and boom everything goes back to normal AGAIN, except this time i come away with a huge panic attack and worsening anxiety.

a month after that and i wake up, shes still awake and so i message her saying hi and \~note that she was actively tweeting ABOUT HER DMS WITH OTHER PEOPLE\~ and absolutely no response comes to me for an hour. so i dm her a couple more times just normally like sending her tweets and stuff and laughing at things and ... still nothing. so at this point i'm like.. okay maybe she needs space!!! and i just dm her ""hey imma give u a bit of space for now but pls message me when/if u want to, i miss u!!"" and boom i get an instant response. except. shes angry at me. for telling her i would give her space. (context to this is that in the past, we literally had discussed my anxiety before and she told me she would tell me if she needed space.) she was angry. that i just let her know i would give her space. because she had ""told me once before"" that she would tell me if she did. like ... how am i in the fault of getting ignored for an hour and a half while the person is actively interacting with everyone else???? anyway she started guilt tripping me, saying that i have to let her make other friends as if i said she couldnt, and she started bringing up how she always understand if \~i\~ dont reply right away, etc, etc. which would be good points.... if i was also actively tweeting about dms w other ppl while i wasnt replying but whenever i dont reply its literally becuase im clearly not online? basicallt she turned it back on me and i felt like shit the entire day and! guess what! i ended up with 3 panic attacks that week and could barely eat because my anxiety was so bad.

well we end up just talking like normal after that one the next day, no apologies or anything just... like nothing happened on her part but now i feel like im walking on fucking eggshells everytime i interact with her and it scares me. all my friends say cut her off but i just.... dont have the heart for it and i dont know how i would do it since we have so many contacts ot each other and she also shares several friends with me.... also tonight yet again, she has been tweeting for hours but NO response to my dm from 2 hours ago even though she has tweeted about her dms a few times as well and i am So Fucking Anxious. like what did i do. did i do anything. lbah blah blah. and considering i do WANT to cut her off, i feel like this shouldnt make me as paranoid and worried as it does bc like... if she cuts me off, thats good right???? but i AM super anxious and i cant stop checking her twitter to see if shes still active and ignoring me but i dont understand why im so attached to someone i cant stand anymore.... what the fuck do i do. also i dnot want this to sound like its all bad bc most days it goes great!! but its gotten to the point where sometimes i literally time when she wakes up and shit so i can avoid her as long as possible which i KNOW means this friendship is absolute shit and needs to be thrown out but..... idk. i dont think i can bring it up to her either because im too scared of backlash so... i am here to ask: how do i at least get myself to stop being so paranoid and detach myself from her emotionally so this doesnt bug me anymore? and a big nagging thought.. am \~I\~ the toxic one here? my anxiety has been in the pits and its affecting my mood, my appetite and my depression is slowly getting worse as well which sucks bc i just got it under control :(",13Oct2020,1

I’m on here because I guess I’m just looking for some clarity with anyone who many know or been through what I’m going through. 

So long story short, i had a sexual relationship with a guy. But things kinda got out of hand and sometimes I found myself doing things I didn’t want to do or even thought I’d ever think of doing. 

Anyways, ever since this happened, I feel so ashamed and every single day I literally my heart drops and starts to tingle. My breathing gets very sharp and cold. I literally get sick to my stomach thinking about it. 

Even when other guys try to be potential lovers to me, in the moment I am okay. But out of nowhere I’m reminded of what I did in the past and what happened and I have a spiral of regrets that I can’t seem to move on from or snap out of. 

I’m so affected by this that I literally- every time I get to my sensual side, my body is literally turned off and I get disgusted and I never explore sexual shiet with other people or even myself.

I don’t know what to do, I know hardly anyone is going to relate to this, it’s such a weird thing, too. Getting absolute pleasure from feeling so hurt? God.. and it’s not sexual pleasure or anything like this, not at all. It’s strictly emotional. I don’t know what to do. I feel like a psychopath.",13Oct2020,1

72,"I just feel like I can't handle life anymore. I can't keep pretending everything is fine.

I'll be okay for like a week but I always come back to this place of depression. Nothing makes me happy and I'm always binging to forget my pain.

I can't talk about my past because I feel like it wasn't real, or that I'm making it up, or that it's my fault it happened. My parents, my dad mostly, was abusive. Physically and verbally. Constantly blacking out in fits of rage, throwing me into walls, throwing furniture at me, choking me, belting me, screaming at me, punishing me for looking at him the wrong way...

My mom didn't help. She didn't care or didn't believe me that it was happened. I have no idea where she was. 

And I feel bad, I feel so guilty for being hurt by all of this. I feel like I'm constantly protecting them... not wanting to hurt them by talking about it or disgracing them by talking about it. I was trapped in my household. I also have misophonia so that never helped things. 

The pain is still there, it's still so fresh. I'm 30 years old and I can still feel my 12 year old self's pain. 

Will it ever go away? I can't afford therapy anymore because of losing my job due to covid. Some days are fine but the older I get the more numb I get. I can't seem to have any fun anymore.

I'm just so tired. So tired of being me. So tired of the pain, the self hatred. I hate my face, I hate looking at myself in the mirror. I'm fat now. I've gained weight so I can be just like my 12 year old self. Fat, abused, depressed, lonely, scared.

Every time it gets better it goes right back to being bad again. I can't keep doing this. I can't keep pretending.

73,"To clarify;

I deal with a pretty heavy dose of anxiety and depression. When I'm with people or at work, I smile and I am happy. When I'm alone I write depressive poetry. I can be indecisive, as in wanting one thing one day, and something else the next. I can lie, without feeling bad about it, but I could never cheat in a relationship. Some time ago, I decided to go to a therapist, who told me that there is nothing wrong with me.

It leads me to believe that I can only help myself in this world, so that's why I ask you reddit; what is the best way to self-heal when you deal with mental health issues?",13Oct2020,1

The main thing is my overwhelming fear of death and an endless void of nothingness only left to my own thoughts my only cope with this is me being a Christian but after thinking about my beliefs and the afterlife I can't exist in heaven as it is a place without sin and I am made of sin so I would be nothing so should I suffer torture for eternity or suffer with my thoughts in nothingness and then I started thinking about personality and how it makes you you and how much my personality has changed as I grew up and how I'm not the same as I used to be and how it will change more and more I thought of suicide but then I realized that my personality would change in the nothingness and then the nothingness that awaited me after that an endless cycle horrifying and unescapable hell is no escape either it awaits you there as well I fear what my future brings and you should too its coming for you it'll get you like it got you before it'll get us all so what do we do it for then why do we strive for greatness when the end awaits us before we can reap the rewards? The time between my thoughts the time where I turn off my brain and just live with people where my thoughts can't torture me.

I am a female who wants to rape and kill someone but obviously I would use and object to penetrate inside of them and I want to take a knife and cut into the skin. Most importantly I want to feel them fight under me as I carve into them. The thought excites me and I enjoy looking at photos of mangled bodies but the feeling wears off. Its like a drug and I can't stop. Everyday I need a new image or video because it doesn't feel the same looking at something I have seen before. I do want to see what would happen if I killed one of the rodents that run around my apartment. Just to see what would happen. I have been fighting the urge but it grows stronger everyday so maybe if I tried at least once it will make it stop? I saw a dead bird this week and its guts were everywhere and my heart started beating and I couldn't stop looking at it. I wanted to get closer to jt and I wanted to touch it. It took everything inside of me not to do it but now I regret not getting close and it makes me angry. Everytime I see one of those dead rats I just wanna cut it open and when I don't I get mad. Its like a drug addict who can't get a fix. Should I try to cut one open and see how I feel or keep fighting the urge.,13Oct2020,1
77,"Trigger warning:

Hi everyone. I don't know how much thoughts I would be able to put in words here but over the past few years I survived. I have been through a lot and I am finally coming to terms with all my struggles. I will not go into details but I can proudly say that I survived:
- Multiple sexual assaults.
- Ignorant parents.
- Two rapes.
- One toxic relationship.
- A suicide attempt.
- Huge numbers of panic attacks (still surviving this btw). 
- Finally, I survived ""Life"" in general. 


It was a rollercoaster ride for me. And I am a 23 year old female in India. There's more coming on my way and over the years I have gained a lot of courage so I am pretty sure I will be able to survive all the future obstacles too. 

I would not have been here if I would have given up on me. Technically I did once when I tried to kill myself. Somehow I was saved. But that's another story. I am only here to tell you that ""There are somedays when I feel grateful that I survived that attempt so I could enjoy/cherish this particular moment.""

I am financially independent now, and it's the most happiest I have ever felt in my life. Being able to take control of my own life. It's an amazing adrenaline rush. Sure there are still some days I feel really low but then I look back on how I fought my way through some really tough times of my life in the past. 

To conclude I would like to say ""You are stronger than you think you are, you can get through this. I believe you. Don't ever give up on yourself."" 

Thank you for reading this till the end. You are precious. Boop ♥️",13Oct2020,1

I know I should take better care

without action.

Why bother fixing myself

I'm neglecting everything important as well and the only interaction with my family is me being a disappointment and the best part is that I have 5 hours to stare at my wall and think about the best way to get out of this hell any way possible mostly an OD with anything I can get my hands on.

He never showed any signs of any problems and never gave any sign of an issue troubling him when we talked. Today while I was doing online school he left the house with his car without telling me. My mom and I found out he left about 2 hours after we think he left. He gave no warning and didn’t say a word to anyone. About an hour later he sent my mom a cryptic text eluding to his location. My mom drove over and called the police to help find him and soon they found his car, empty and unlocked with a note and car keys. The officer went into the nearby woods to look and found his body, with a shotgun next to him. I just don’t know why he didn’t say anything to me. His note said he thought he was unfixable but I knew him so well and knew any problem he had we could help him with. He said he thought he couldn’t become independent in college because he was too lazy but I knew that was wrong. He was the smartest most dedicated person I ever knew.

I’m so paranoid that people hate me and my friends will abandon me. When I go out in public I’m scared everyone’s staring and judging me. I want it to stop, I know they’re just delusions but I panic thinking they’re real. My apartment mates and I get along fine but if one of them even looks at me while I’m not paying attention I immediately jump to “oh my god, they hate me and think I’m weird.” I’ve wondered if they have a separate group chat that excludes me multiple times, no evidence to back that up or anything, just paranoia.

I drive my friends away by being overly obsessive and possessive of them. Like today my friend told me she started a diet (not even a trend diet, just eating healthier) and I freaked out saying she’ll get anorexia and die. But that won’t happen, I’m just overreacting as usual and don’t know how to stop. Or if I think my friends are mad at me I’ll ask them over and over if they are, what did I do, I’m sorry and I’ll try to make it better. It gets on their nerves and then they actually do get mad at me, which just makes me spiral more.

I get way too frustrated and angry easily. For example, yesterday I wanted to go to an antique store, but since I’m not familiar with the area I got lost and immediately started sobbing, hitting + scratching myself, and repeating “I hope I get hit by a fucking bus since I’m just a stupid, fucking waste of space” over and over. Didn’t even get to the antique store. And that’s how I react to anger/frustration every. Single. Time. My emotional regulation doesn’t exist.

I've got my whole life fucking shit up. Never had a regular childhood - had violent outbursts which ended up after multiple short term stays at a long term facility for over half a year. Then I went to mddle/high school where I was in a separate room and did mostly online classes. I ended up cheating through them and being bored out of my mind with no socialization. Never made a friend. Just... Coasted. 

I haven't started college cause I don't know what to do. I can't even hold down a fast food job so how am I supposed to even have a clue of what I want to do for life. I'm almost 20 which scares me to say. 

I can't date anyone, for multiple reasons. I'm super shy. The only couple times people have tried to online I end up pushing them away, so I dont even gave anyone online. I've tried to go on dates a couple times but got ghosted twice, and when I go to hookup with guys I'm so awkward so I stopped pretty quick. I'm also just afraid. Emotionally. Putting myself out for someone gives me like physical anxiety. Let alone finding a guy that can tolerate my emotionally stunted ugly ass self.  But of course at the same time, the thoughts of being able to come home to someone else is what's kept me going for so long. It's the thing I want most but the thing I need the least rn.

I still get really angry sometimes..less often, but given that I'm not 12 anymore I'm scared it has the potential to be worse. I still get bad anxiety. Being around or talking to other people still feels awkward to me. And I can tell they know I'm awkward. I just have to fake talking to other people it feels like. I hate it. I'm had extreme wanderlust recently but given my family is the only thing keeping me from being *completely* broke it's not really an option. 

I'm just sick of it. I hate it. I had ""accepted"" that I'm not normal, but no, i fucking hate it. I wish I could hold down a normal job. That I could go about my day talking to people without feeling forced. That I could have someone to love.

I can't get therapy as I can't afford it. And I can't even ask my doc to prescribe some kind of anti-anxiety med or something because I can't see them till March, and being the first appointment with them they likely won't wanna do that.

88,"I’ve had trust issues since I was little . . . When I was about 7, I began to experience depression symptoms, but my mom didn’t believe me. I think my trust issues are from emotional abuse from my mother. When I was ask her for help when feeling anxious or depressed, she would get angry. She’d tell the whole family and I would end up being humiliated. She was extremely critical of my appearance, especially my hair and weight, since I didn’t match up to my older sister. In high school, I would try to leave before she woke up in the morning so that she wouldn’t force me to change clothes into some she liked and I hated. Two times in my life I told her I was suicidal, and she mocked me, almost telling me to just do it already. 

The last three years of my life have been hell. 
Three consecutive low points of my life, all because of my mom. The first was when I was 17, I took the ACT and received a score so low that I spent two days crying continuously. The third day, I had finally stopped crying, and so I tried to do what I could to make myself happy. When I finally came out of my room after two days, my mom asked me if I wanted to work a bit on one of my projects, but I said no because I still wanted time to get my mentality back together. Suddenly, she just started screaming at me, and just broke. My dad had to come in and tell my mom to stop because I was completely defeated. The same day I went to a mental hospital for serious suicidal thoughts. After I got out of the hospital, I was prescribed with medication that took my depression and anxiety away completely. 

The second instance was when my family and I moved to Australia for a year for my dad’s work when I was 18. Dad would go to work, my younger brother would go to school, and Mom and I would be at the apartment. But since we never got along, Mom and I fought everyday. Soon enough, the depression and anxiety came back, but stronger than ever. One day while in church, I was feeling sad because I was homesick. I guess Mom noticed me, so she asked me what’s wrong. I told her I was fine, and then she got furious. She grabbed me by the wrist and dragged me out of the chapel in front of everyone. She made sit down on a bench outside and demanded to know why I was sad. So I told her I was feeling homesick, and I started to sob because she got ever angrier after that. She started yelling; she was yelling so loud that the people in the chapel could hear her. I guess Dad heard her, and he came outside to tell Mom to stop. My Dad hugged me, while mom was still throwing her tantrum. She said, “I want you to go back home just so you can suffer there too.” After we all got home, I left the apartment because I had decided to end my life. There were two times in that year where I approached the same bridge to end my life. The whole year spent in Australia, I was isolated and alone, which was another factor to my depression. 

The third has only just ended. This was soon after I came back from Australia when I was 19. I had a horrible first semester in college, failed two classes because of severe depression and anxiety. I came home after that semester because I believed I needed to rest my emotional state. But within the first few days of being home, Mom threatened to kick me out of the house. After I started therapy, she told me I needed to get a job because I was sucking up all her money. The next nine months, both Mom, Dad and my whole family made me realize that I hate all of them. 

Anytime I asked for help because of anxiety or depression from my Mom, she would roll her eyes and get angry. When I asked Dad, he would tell me to get a job. When I asked my oldest brother, he told me to stop being such a baby. Thankfully his wife shut him up and came to talk to me because she knew I was crying. 

Later within those nine months, I adopted a puppy to be my emotional support dog, but the hell got even worse. Whenever the puppy would go to the bathroom in the house, everyone would scream at me. This happened so much that I became severely depressed and started to neglect the puppy (I would still feed her and give her water). One day when I came home from therapy, the puppy had gone to the bathroom in the house again, and my sister snapped at me. I got angry and snapped back until we started yelling at each other. Then Dad came in and started yelling at me too, then next my younger brother. I screamed at the top of my lungs and just lost it. Mom came in and told everyone to stop. After that I went to my room after shouting that I hated everyone, and locked myself in my rooms for hours. 

The next day, I got into a fight with my boyfriend. At some point in our argument, I just broke and started sobbing like crazy. When I went downstairs for help, I noticed the puppy was gone, then I found out my mom had take her to a dog shelter. I went back into my room and was crying for about an hour when I called my dad and asked if I could go to the hospital. 

As all of this has happened, I’ve had every few people I can talk to. I’ve developed even worse trust issues than I’d ever had before, and it’s extremely frustrating. When someone actually does try to help, I feel like they’re faking. I become scared they want to manipulate me in some way, or behind the screen they’re laughing or rolling their eyes. Sadly even with my boyfriend, whenever he tries to comfort me, I feel like I’m just burdening him, so I keep secrets from him about what’s on my mind, or say nothing when I’m experiencing severe anxiety. I also feel that my therapist is faking too, and that she’s trying to get into my head and manipulate me . . . 

How do I get over this . . . . It makes me extremely anxious 24/7, and I don’t know what to do about it. I can never feel happy because of this problem. 

To those who read this through, thank you for doing so and tolerating all of it. It means a lot.",13Oct2020,1

I've been struggling mentally for as long as I can remember but recently it's gotten a lot more serious.

90,"I was ready to make a change in my life that was a direct reaction of a decision I made and not a choice of a hand full my parents gave me. (Most of the times, I only could do what they proposed, otherwise it would cause problems, like mentioned before). I had money, therefore I had dominion over myself. Something that apparently didn’t sit right with my folks. 

If this sound like something a very immature person would think, I am sorry, but with an age of 24, I would assume I have the right to make choices as an adult. I believed that despite this choice being an obviously rushed decision, something that I was not known for due to my constant research, I was clearly at an age where I should be handling many responsibilities and decisions. Also, my very late “blooming"" in terms of life due to the circumstances in it, left me already in an eager state to follow my newfound self proposed accountability, something I believe my parents may not have wanted me to achieve. My conjecture as to why it was like this may be due to my parents personal issues with themselves and a push for “living in the past” where I was still a kid and times in their marriage where simpler. I could argue It was a sense that their kid was no longer which filled them with emotion.... yet what was mentioned before had certainly something to do with it. This led to a push from them, taking a plane ticket as well and force my living arrangements on to my extended family. 

To be clear, I appreciate the gesture, yet this was something I purposely set for myself as means to completely clean off my slate, start a new life and force me to overcome my past trauma which they were enveloped in. To reiterate, I do not blame my parents of my shortcomings. Also, I was sure my extended family was not prepared for this, yet it ended up happening. 

My decision was ultimately bastardized and my unwillingness to overcome my parents resurfaced again yet not for the same reasons. Whether this was for my lack of a spine or sense of pity as my mother was still unprepared due to an unwillingness to accept the years that have passed, I still debate. I sympathized with her and I also understood that I was still unsure as to what to do when I got here. Yet this was ultimately what led up to my recent failures that I am going to unfold.",13Oct2020,1

92,"My friends who are diagnosed with DID and OSDD 1B have noticed that I seem like I switch, but I’m always the same person still if that makes sense. They tell me that I’ll act like a completely different person, but my relationship with them always stays the same and I never go by any new names or anything. I’ve always expressed too that I feel like my personality changes and to a specific set, but it isn’t intentional and is uncontrollable. My voice will change as well and I’ve been told even my posture and the way I carry myself changes, which I never noticed. Sometimes I’ll talk and move and feel like I’m possessed because it’s so different than how I normally act and it’s not intentional. I’ve had past coworkers comment on it too. Then once I identify these things happening, they seem to die down for a while, like my brain is trying to hide it from me. I end up thinking I’m “just weird,” and that’s the reason that happens. I definitely relate a lot to OSDD 1A. I also have called when this happens me being another version of myself because that’s how I’ve always saw it. I dissociate a lot trying to talk about these things too. Also these parts/versions of myself are something people have been commenting on since I was a kid and for the one that I think has shown up the most in my life, for whatever reason I have an idea of what she looks like in my head but idk that might be unrelated. The parts are very contradictory as well. One is calm and collected in situations where I may have anxiety, has no fear as if I never had anxiety, and acts and talks like an adult, even has a lower voice. My regular self just talks normally but I do have a lot of anxiety. Then there’s a version who seems a lot younger than I really am. I feel like a young child and I get stuck in that “version,” I talk like a little kid and get really nervous and fidgety and just can barely speak. I can’t help but act like a child, it’s hard to explain. There’s more but I don’t want to share. I only explained those two because of how contradictory they can be. The thing is for OSDD 1A I don’t know if I have the amnesia to fit the diagnosis. I definitely have very bad memory, but most of the time I can remember if given a few minutes and something to remind me of that memory. I’m not sure if I have enough memory problems to count for OSDD 1A but my friends have suggested if not that, maybe CPTSD caused me to fragment. I wanted to know what others thought, especially those with DID/OSDD and/or CPTSD and how I can find more information regarding CPTSD for this because I can’t find anything. Thanks!",13Oct2020,1
93,"TW: Self harm, suicidal thoughts

So I don't really know where to post this, but i really just want to write it all down. I don't think i'm doing well. Everything feels hectic and disjointed, and I hate it. I thrive off of knowing things, knowing how to do something, how to complete it, and i just don't know anymore. I am at a new school, doing totally different work then i have ever done, and I feel like I'm falling behind, but i can't get myself to finish what i need to, and the work just keeps piling up. I feel like a piece of shit, always procrastinating but never able to find a way out. I was so excited or today, though, because the work was manageable, and i thought it would give me the chance to just get everything done, but it didn't. My friend has also been having a hard time, they just found out they have mild depression and ADHD. They said they had been breaking down all of yesterday, so when they asked to come over to get away from their family (Part of the problem), of course i said yes. But it put me so behind, and just spending four hours with one of my best friends was exhausting. They were talking about all the trouble they were having in their life, and even though i have felt so many of the same things, i felt like i couldn't say anything, i jyst sat their and nodded. They joked about how the school councilor talked to them, shit about how if they were hurting themselves, they would need to tell my friends parents and whatever. The thing is, the jokes would have been funny, except i have ben actively self-harming. Nothing serious, it started off with scratching myself, then sticking duct tap to my arm and ripping it off, and now i've only used a razor twice, and not dep enough to draw blood. But im so scared, and i feel so bad because my friend needs me, but i just feel tired and its so hard to feel empathetic, even if i want to. I think people are noticing, too, or maybe im just reading into things. My bf just messaged me saying I've been distant and he was worried, and i told him i was fine. Thats the thing, and it sounds so selfish but i really want help, but i can't bring myself to tell anyone. I'm not in danger of killing myself, i know that much, but I think i may be doing worse then i Think. Half the time it feels like i'm breathing through concrete, even when i'm not even thinking about the stuff that stresses me out. I've talked to my mom about maybe seeing a therapist, but if i told them overnighting, they would have to tell my parents, which i don't want. It doesn't hep that i'm part of LGBTQ and teh though of mentioning it to people i know makes me want to vomit. 

I guess teh only reason for this post is to write everything down and see if i'm just overreacting. Sorry for the block paragraph, and i hope this is an okay place to post. I'm sure I'll be told if it isn't. Thanks",13Oct2020,1

95,"Hi I am an 18 year old male and I am wondering if anyone can tell me if I have a mild case of OCD. I can say that from the earliest of my memories I always had an obsession to pluck my hair. Typically this only involved me picking my eyelashes or eyebrows out. I didn’t do it manically though so it never looked like I had actually done anything to my eyelashes or eyebrows. However, when I was around 16 or so I began to incessantly pluck my hair with tweezers. Since I am a very meticulous person it typically takes 3 hour long sessions of just tweezing hairs out all over myself. I like to keep myself as clean as I can since I’m somewhat of a germaphobe, so I typically tweeze hairs around my face, armpits, and genitals since I feel that those areas of my body are the ones which I always like to keep clean at all times. This may also be strange but I have on one occasion tweezed the small patches of hair that grow on top of the toes because it looked more aesthetically pleasing to not have hair on my toes. Is this a form of OCD?",13Oct2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

So lately I have been wanting to isolate myself from others more and more. I've noticed that I hate being with other people (just Thanksgiving yesterday was a nightmare) and I can't get myself to get help. This pattern started in August where I argued with my relatives/parents about something in a hotel room and broke down because thoughts like ""They're probably laughing at you in their heads"" ""Wow they probably think you're so dumb!"" ""They don't care about you, they only care if you obey them."" and I started breaking down. My mom tried telling me how I'm lucky to be with many people and when she was depressed she had no one. For 5 seconds I felt guilty until I responded with ""Don't you DARE manipulate me with your over-exaggerated sob story!"" and then felt extremely mad again. When my friend vented about her life and her relationships I first felt empathetic and then my mind had to say ""bro she wants to waste your time and make you feel sorry for her so that you can do more work for her"" (I tend to help her a lot in school). During online classes I turned off my camera and mic because I started crying over responding late to a question, thinking the class sees me as an annoyance. Yesterday I started crying in my bedroom thinking that my family likes making fun of me because they casually asked stuff like ""Are you a boy"" ""Are you straight"" (to give context biologically and in terms of identity i'm a female but I act tomboyish according to those around me. This was a gender reveal and now I just so happen to live with 2 boys) The same day I was questioning my tendencies I felt guilty for assuming the worst out of people, and then I thought ""They're manipulation is catching up to you, don't let it."" Back in August I thought of asking for a therapist and then I remembered when I went there in January and my mind said ""last time you went their your family purposely got one to gaslight you into thinking you're dumb for talking back. They purposely made the therapist think you are in the wrong which is why the therapist advised you to grow up and not them. Remember when your mom cried when she said that she wanted to spend more time with you but can't due to jobs? Why do you think she would cry other than to manipulate you. Why wouldn't they do it again?"" One I just thought of how my plan of exploiting my parent's will to give me university money so that I can 'get revenge' and then abandon them after university. I thought how shitty of a person I was, and then I thought that I was being to nice again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what's going on. Feelings of anxiety increased and my general mood decreased starting August of this year with hat argument, but this is a pattern I've remembered since January 2020.",13Oct2020,1
98,"TW sexual abuse

this feels weird writing but i don't know what to fucking do. i went through so much shit last year, it took me so many months to realize most of my sexual encounters last year were assault. i never wanted to feel like a victim so i convinced myself they were just bad experiences everyone has. i told my mom about the worst one, which was being raped summer 2019, she cried in my arms while i stayed numb. that was three months ago. nothing else happened after that, i just pushed it to the back of my mind because i thought saying it aloud once would be enough venting. 

my local community recently exposed the man who hurt me, and i read stories about him doing the same to multiple girls. i've had some thoughts of coming forward with my story but i haven't. i keep getting horrible flashbacks to last year, and i don't know why. i've been close to panic attacks various times these past two weeks, they keep getting worse. 

I don't know why it's coming back to fuck with my head. i don't know if it should be in my past by now, i feel so stupid asking for a therapist. something in my mind tells me it's stupid going into an office just to tell someone about being raped. i don't know why, i would never react that way if someone came to me about their abuse. but when i think about myself i just feel so stupid. i don't know what to do anymore.",13Oct2020,1
99,"A friend of mine has major overthinking issues and gets VERY hyper and tensed even if it’s a very minor issue. She has PCOD so she gets major mood swings and casually disrespects me if we argue over something and then later says that she expects me to understand that she has issues and she didn’t actually mean the disrespect it was just out of her anxiety. 
And if get upset about the disrespect- she’ll make me feel bad about it that I am the one who doesn’t understand that how she reacted was not in her hands and it just happened.

Before continuing, please read the warning above. I am half Japanese on my mothers side, and today I have absolutely no reason to be proud of it. I thought that my great grandfather was a good guy. He saved my amazing kind and caring grandpa from drowning by lifterally climbing down a well and carrying him up after he fell in many meters deep. He, at 108 was so sweet and could still communicate with us. He'd ask how my day went, he'd give me a big smile and he seemed like a good person. I was proud to have him. But now I'm not sure if i can be. I knew he went to war because my grandpa said so. But holy crap. I cannot fathom what I learned today. In the war, Japan went to Korea and the men raped and sexually abused so many women. An absurd amount. These women were called 'comfort women'. They would be sexually abused and killed and it was so digusting and so so so horrible and the thought of it makes me want to die. He went to korea. What if he did something. If he sexually assaulted those women, the  I'm related to a rapist. I have rapist blood. And the thought of that feels so disgusting and wrong because I am very very passionate on womens rights and that was just an absolute abuse on human rights. I feel so guilty and I cant believe that if he did that then I am related to him and I grew up thinking he was a good person and actually mourned his death. Because if he was a rapist he did NOT deserve the good life he got. Maybe I deserve to be hurt. I cant believe this and am absolutely destroyed, those poor women. And to think that my people had a part in it is so embarrassing and disgusting, and to think my own blood did that is so so so horrible. I feel like a bad person. I knew Japan went to war but I never knew this. I don't know for sure what he did, nobody really does. And part of me is trying to say he was too good of a person but you can never really know someone. I asked my dad about it and he said he wouldn't be surprised if he did something. My mothers side is full of mentally unstable people. Most people in her family are either psychotic or extremely mentally ill, winding up running away and being found dead in an appartment months after their deaths. I'm not sure why but literally everyone is very ill. Any how, as I said I'm not 100% sure. But even the thought that I could be related to that absolutely tares me apart and I cant imagine how those women would've felt. I feel like a horrible human.",13Oct2020,1

102,"Just like a lot of people, this year has been rough for me. My mental health is slipping and I’m worried I’m going to do something I will ultimately regret. I’m lucky enough to still be employed, but how much longer is still a question. Tomorrow will be my last day of vacation and I’ve been trying to do things I enjoy; eating delicious meals without a care, playing video games with friends, watching old shows and movies, visiting loved ones (within reason), going for long walks, and even getting back into art. But the joy only lasts for a short period. I’ve let my house get messy and my office work unsorted. If it wasn’t for automatic billing, my bills would be unpaid. At 27 years old, I think I’m developing sleep apnea. Just one more thing to go along with my crippling anxiety, my depression, my IBS, my poor skin, and my other less-than-favorable traits. I’ve noticed that I’m having lapses in memory, but what’s more terrifying is now I’m hearing things. Especially at night. It’s so bad that I’ve resorted to sleeping on the couch because I’m too afraid to sleep in my own room. I would be lying if I said I haven’t been hallucinating as well. And the nightmares are returning. I was hoping the walks I take every day would help my mental state. It hasn’t. On a more positive note, my loss of appetite combined with my daily walks has caused me to drop 15 lbs In three weeks, so I’ve got that going for me. I’ve called the crisis hotline several times, and it helps for a brief period of time. The person I normally go to for help stopped talking to me without any explanation. I recently took a trip with my family, and although we were barely around other people, and while we took the necessary precautions when we were, I was so unnerved by the threat of the virus that I demanded we cut the trip short by a day. I feel like I ruined the whole trip for them as they wanted to see my cousin and uncle the next day. Between the IBS flare ups and the anxiety attacks, I was ultimately miserable. The entire time, I wanted to be home. But when I was home, I wanted to be somewhere else. I truly feel like this house is haunted by the ghosts of my own creation. I guess I’m just writing this because I can’t sleep and I just need to vent.

We had a conversation and  I thought we talked about it and I felt like we had reached some sort of understanding. I felt like you actually Understood for a moment why the door chime is very triggering for me as a person who deals with my difficulties. 

I see now that you might not grasp or understand how upsetting something like a repeated loud noise such as the 
door chime might be  to someone like me. 

(I don’t see any value in explaining that either. I probably would have before but I see now that offering my perspective is useless and it’s best for me to just silently take it and then leave with all my belongings in a timely fashion. This message is my final attempt to communicate how this beeper actually makes me feel. 

-I want to remind you right now that this message is not hostile despite the fact that I am clearly upset by the beeper noise. This message is merely a tool for simultaneous introspection, communication, and for people to get a deeper understanding of what can sometimes be an actually very triggering event for me. 
When I say that I don’t think you understand... it’s because I actually feel that way. For a reason.)


I now don’t see how you would possibly be able to feel what I feel when I hear the door chime beeep beep deeep every time I’m trying to get a breath of fresh air. It’s really just  suffocating. I truly don’t mean to be dramatic. 
 It was confusing to me when I came home from Miami that night and there it was again and it wasn’t even verbally addressed at all even a little bit. 

I found that message a little confusing but mostly just hurtful- especially in the wake of having been brusquely called a “child” after I had clearly graduated college from a well-known and prestigious university. I truly don’t think that people realize how difficult that was and how gracefully I managed very specific challenges that life had presented me at that time. 
It was a little known fact that I had graduated college and I felt this point had  barely been  acknowledged - glossed over - or at the least .. I might say “slightly dismissed by my estimation”. 

I understand at this point that because I’m so “thin” and “weak looking” that people have a tough time believing that I’m actually healthy and came out on top. 

Well.. I did actually. And that’s how my life will continue to be. As long as I keep working on myself. That’s how this works. 

It’s pretty amazing but I have found in life that when you continue to work on yourself you only continue to just get better. 

It’s upsetting and confusing to me that I am having difficulty communicating where I’m at in life. 

I’m not a child despite what you may think and I’m doing very well despite what you may think.

 I really don’t presume to know what you think anymore. I’m taking stabs, shots in the dark at this point – let’s face it. I can’t read the situation accurately anymore. 

The door beeper thing sent a message to me and it said that you still want to control and keep tabs on my movements. I get that. It’s probably just because you care and you want to make sure I’m not doing some thing self-destructive. I get it. 

But the reality of my life moving forward is that I love going outside for fresh air and the door chime beeper thing really just puts me on edge and makes me feel watched and I’m not really sure what the essential purpose of that thing is up to a certain point once you’ve secured a certain degree of physical safety for yourself, your house, and your family. 


At a certain point it really ...just sends a message. Especially when it’s done the way you did. Silently and without word. 

I honestly feel like that’s what I think. I’m sorry that I had to say it this way but I felt really bad about the situation.

109,"I've(18 f) been feeling depressed for years. I thought it was just a phase but it got worse because of a traumatic incident back in February of 2017, since then my mental health was spiraling downwards. I've been pushing everyone away, i make them angry, even when i don't mean any harm. I've got my online friends, though they always think I'm happy-go-lucky. It's exhausting to pretend you're someone you're not. I've always put people's feelings and well being before mine but lately, i just want to put myself first. It makes me feel worse about myself though, like I'm this giant asshole who can't even care for a friend. Every time i laugh or smile at a joke, i think I'm not good enough to be happy, i feel nasty having positive feelings. It makes me want to throw up. 

I lack the energy to do anything for myself. I cook for my siblings and parents, but that's the most i do before i get absolutely exhausted. I've been stress eating junk food for a while, i tried to switch to healthy things but that became too much of a hassle.

I shouldn't be sad or depressed or lonely about anything. I know i lead a good life, I've got both my parents, we've got a stable income and a good education. This is all good, this should make me happy. The only thing wrong is how toxic my family can be. I know my parents don't mean any harm with their actions, they do it because they care and don't want us to make stupid mistakes.   
My parents don't let me leave the house at all, even before quarantine. I was only allowed one summer  job last year(only because it was at a church and my grandpa was friends with the pastor, aka my former boss).   
My siblings(11 f,14 m,21 f) always make fun of me, calling me fat, weak, pig, retard. Every time i stutter, they mimic me and ridicule me. My family just thinks I'm very lazy, but it's hard to do things when you see no point in it.

i zone out or get distracted very easily whenever someone tries to start a conversation with me. I can't seem to process words as fast as i used to, it takes me a couple minutes but i understand most of the time. The only time i can focus is when i using my fingers or playing tetris while listening to a story. Music helps me focus on what I'm doing with my hands because i simply follow the rhythm with my fingers.  
After getting sleep paralysis for the first time back on May 19th, 2020, I've been seeing and hearing a lot more things flying about or hiding in corners. Seeing things that aren't there, or just seeing irregular people (today i saw my dad with an extra arm, extra eye, and a white, furry thing floating on his shoulders).  
Honestly, these visions might be happening because i cant seem to sleep for more than 30 minutes at a time without waking up. these past 3 months, i haven't been able to sleep during the night, so I've slept as much as i can during daylight hours(try an hour at a time then wake up and repeat) Every time i open my eyes, i see creepy faces staring down at me, they look so real, then it disappears after a couple seconds. 

I called Kaiser Permanente a week ago and they set me up with a psychiatrist. I'm supposed to meet them (online meeting)  on October 19th in the morning.  Something about depression and ADHD. 

I haven't told my parents about this because if they, they'd tell me to cancel it and try to convince me that there's nothing wrong with me. I've never told anyone so much information.

I just feel so drained by it.

There are 5 very loud, extroverted people in the team, and then me and 2 other quieter people. It has gotten to the point where me and the other 2 quieter people had to make a separate channel for us to sit in and work because we can't cope with the constant noise and communication, or at least I can't (don't want to speak for them). However, this has really put a wedge between us and the 5 other people, basically resulting in two teams. I really want to work as a full team, but I just can't deal with the 8 hours a day of talking to the other group, especially when they're really loud and often go on tangents about random stuff that my tired out brain just doesn't keep up with.

Having this other channel was pretty much how us 3 quieter ones survived up to this point, but now that an idea has been chosen we have no choice but to be with everyone. As I say, I do try my best to contribute, to communicate and to act as a team - even when we were two groups I would go into the other call quite often and see how it was all going. However, i'm really noticing the effects now, I wake up exhausted, I can barely think, and I feel completely burnt out. After work all I can think about doing is collapsing on the sofa and just nearly crying because my brain is so tired. I have no motivation anymore, no passion or energy and I just hate it.

Additionally, I have had really bad anxiety for my whole life, so talking to people doesn't come naturally. Being in that call with everybody triggers my anxiety pretty hard, so on top of everything else i'm trying to constantly fend off all these anxious thoughts 100 times a second, also while trying not to freeze up and do my work like normal. It just feels impossible. I have regular anxiety attacks (3 last week, fun) so theres often times where all I can do is mute my mic while I listen to them and try not to let my head explode. However that also makes me feel like i'm not contributing which makes me feel worse.

I'm having therapy once per week but I only recently started it so its mainly just outlining whats going on.

I'm really not sure what to do - it's like I've got to do this for a whole year but I just don't know how to deal with this situation. If anyone has any advice I'd be really appreciative.

Thanks,

116,"So I’m a 24 years old and a single mother to 3 sons aged: 5, 3 and 2 years old. 

I’ve always suffered with extreme anxiety, social anxiety and depression and I’ve always had low self esteem. But never this bad. I have been through a lot these past 2 years but with the way I’ve been feeling I feel like there’s something more going on than just depression and anxiety. 

Last year in July I lost my dad to throat cancer. Then this year in March my partner of 6 years broke up with me and I don’t really talk too him anymore and he doesn’t see the kids unless he wants too which is, not much. My best friend and my **only** friend cut me off in August. So I do feel like all of that has something to do with it. 

A list of things going on with me. 

•I’m struggling to get out of bed 
•I don’t want to leave my house 
•I’m staying up late at night but extremely tired during the day 
•I feel unmotivated and I hate looking at myself in the mirror and even _avoid_ it because I feel like I look terrible 
•I’m extremely irritable and I get snappy with people then I feel extremely bad later 
•I’m extremely paranoid and I’m always thinking people are talking about me or planning to conspire against me. (I even deleted my social media because of this) 
•I’m obsessing over my ex partner, thinking about him 24/7 and it’s been 7 months. Some days I’ll be better but then I’ll start again and it’s draining me. 
•one minute I’m depressed and low so bad to the point where I just want to give up on everything the next I’m full of energy, I don’t feel depressed and I want to be just run amuck. It’s like my mind isn’t slowing down. 

I’m going to see my doctor but I can’t see a therapist yet, does this sound like “typical” depression to you?(sorry I don’t think that’s the right word to use) 

I’m starting to worry about myself, the paranoia is what’s worrying me the most.",13Oct2020,1

It feels so new to me since it's been a while since I've experienced this. I don't know how to handle it anymore, I've tried breathing exercises too. It's honestly so exhausting because when I get home I feel super drained out. Do you have any tips regarding my situation? It would be very much appreciated. Thank you!",13Oct2020,1
118,"Hi all, 

I have been struggling with anxiety and depression for over 8 years, and have been seeing psychiatrists for 8 years now. I don't think I can accurately pinpoint the exact diagnosis,  doctors diagnosed me with different disorders, GAD, Bipolar, MDD, adjustment, ptsd, and ADHD.  

Briefly, I'm a 29 yo male, my life isn't going well from all aspects, career, family, financially, emotionally, socially, my parents are killing me with expectations, drug addict and emotionally abusive father (not a bad person though, he just cant see it). I didn't do well back in college. I'm trying so hard, but I can't focus on anything, and sleep is nearly nonexistent (without meds I wake up every couple of hours and take so long to get back), I get nervous easily, and I have do better at work, my good relationship with my colleague and the management is what keeps me so far, but I want to be here because of my efforts.

I tried most of SSRIs (Prozac, Escitalopram, and Sertaline) + Mirtazapine, and I never achieved noticeable improvement, only laziness and demotivation, sometimes slow cognitively. I also had Lamictal (Lamotrigine), which was only ok. Many doctors were too afraid to do any combination treatments. 

Until I visited the last doctor and told him the whole story, he suggested a plan, and I already started, so far I think I'm fine, but I also think I'm taking a lot of medications, I don't want to have any health complications because of this treatment plan.

My list of meds:

Lamictal 100 mg (incrementally increased by 50, doctor will increase to 200)

Wellbutrin XL 150 mg (doctor plans to stop it eventually)

Sertraline 50 mg 

Seroquel 100 mg (doctor will increase to 200)

&amp;#x200B;

So, should I be patient and give it time? Or you think some of the meds interdict?  Because I've done my research, and I didn't see this plan being followed by anyone, and the meds don't interact.

Thank you guys!",13Oct2020,1

121,"I have put lot time into improving my life, but i have always wondered what people stress for.

Personally only thing i can find to stress for anymore is where i put my time into.

Like comparing should i put more time into studying instead of working or spending with friends for example then early as possible i try to choose how i spend it so i don't have to worry about it would become stress if i didn't address it.

I totally get the stress when there ain't time for everything but all of them still have to be done. One problem to me arises that how im ever going to have a family since thats like sacrificing your whole life into it i can't think it to be any less than 6 hours a day to handle everything (including thinking it takes time too) wouldn't be suprized if more. 

I have before cut most my friends even though they all were amazing just for the matter that i can't put the time to have the relationship with them all without taking time out from studying and that to me is too big of sacrifice to make specially early in life when I express time to spend at it.",13Oct2020,1
122,"It's weird, I'm motivated to get my degree and start my career and all that but for some reason I just have no emotional response to anybody, whether it be girls or guys, I feel no emotion toward them when I talk to them. 

 For the most part if I don't have to talk to anybody I'm fine but still feel empty like I want to be with someone but don't at the same time, it's weird, I've only felt like this for a little over a year now. It's hard to explain. There will be times where I want a girlfriend but then don't because I would be bored of it and wouldn't want to do anything.
 
Even at work, it's a retail chain with lots co-workers my age(20s), I wouldn't mind if I don't talk all day.  if co-workers say hi to me I just say hi back and hope they don't start a conversation with me as I have no interest to talk at all. 

I don't know if it's just a phase but I just don't care about anybody,(not in a mean way) just hard to explain.

124,"About three years ago my girlfriend left me. I was heartbroken, and it got worse when a friend told me she'd be cheating on me, left me for him and all of friends knew and helped her lie to me about it. I know people have been through worse stuff, but that betrayal (to be clear her/my friends lying to me, *not* her leaving me) drove me to some very dark places and my life's kinda fallen apart as a result. I've dropped out of my degree, found it difficult to trust other romantic parnters, driven away friends who couldn't deal with my MH crises, and basically gone full force into a downward spiral. 

And now I've found out that the conversation with that friend, who confessed to the whole thing, might never have happened. My mind may have just made it up. Now I'm not sure if I can trust my relationship with reality. I feel pathetic and ridiculous and like my entire life for the last three years has been me responding to something that *never happened*.

126,"Trigger warning: mention of intrusive thoughts and depressive thoughts

So for a while now I've had this problem. I suffer from OCD and anxiety, the OCD is mainly intrusive thoughts but has been under control for a while now, until last night when things started to get scary again. For a long time, I haven't been sleeping well and I'm lucky if I get to sleep before midnight. I think it's because deep down I'm scared. If I try and sleep at a reasonable time, it takes me a good amount of time to drop off, that time my brain spends overthinking. I don't really think of things that have happened, I think about intrusive thoughts and I can't control them. It's not my thinking voice, my thinking voice is quiet. I see things when I'm trying to sleep and honestly, it scares the shit out of me, and to know that I'm starting to struggle with my mental health again is scaring me because last time I struggled I wanted to die. I see intrusive thoughts, like bad things happening to people I love, or I just get random images of scary faces like I'm dreaming but I'm awake with my eyes closed. When I realize I'm having these thoughts I can sit up and open my eyes but as soon as I try and settle back down again I'm back in this cycle. So to avoid this I lay scrolling through social media until I'm on the brink of dropping off, which is early hours of the morning. I'm constantly drained. It helps if I have Netflix on in the background so I'm listening to something I like. I've never read anywhere of this happening to anyone else and it makes me feel crazy.

129,"Think I need to return to therapy

I was in therapy most of last year through my year 12 (final year of high school), as my depression got me really really low.
Pretty much at the beginning of this year she said she thought I was ready to stop, or pretty much implied that we’re going to need to finish counselling soon because the free service I’m with (for adults 18+), has a fairly long waiting list.
I honestly thought I was ready too, until now.
The only reason I thought I was okay to stop is because every time I went in there we really didn’t have much to talk about, and I was finding it hard to find things to talk about or bring up (even know I have a lot of problems deep down).
Anyway, 
I think I need to return to therapy, I’ve begun self harming again and just feel myself slipping back into my worse depression, but there is literally no free psychologists in my area for 19 year olds. :( I need a psychologist who will help me talk about things, and won’t expect me to have something to talk about each session, but will know how to help me psychologically instead of talking to me only about my day to day issues. 
I feel so hopeless. :(",13Oct2020,1

It was honestly one of the most terrifying experiences I've ever been. All I did the whole week was cry and devise the perfect plan. I was determined to die and nothing could stop me. But fortunately, I was knocked into my senses so here I am today😊

However, after that incident, I couldn't find the motivation to complete my schoolworks that resulted to me being too anxious to sleep. I can't seem to find the energy to take care of myself, which was weird because even if I was lazy, I still do it.

133,"Hi, everyone. It’s been a couple months now since the initial COVID-19 lockdown and the protest/riots pertaining to George Floyd and police brutality, and I’m hoping to gain some assistance on my aunt who has been acting somewhat out of character since these initial events.

She is an aunt 20 years older than me (40yo), who I’ve known to be quite level headed though out all my life. But since the events from this past summer, I find myself seeing her behavior quite odd. As I know she leans conservative, at first the jokes appeared to be light hearted pertaining to say, ‘democrats will ban coffee’, per say, has gone to somewhat of oddly out of character like that Fauci should be tried for mass murder. Antifa causing civil unrest. Or that ban of HCQ to treat COVID is a hoax (mind you she actually works in medical research, so I thought she would know better). Somewhat of down the rabbit whole stuff. 

It’s not that we didn’t talk about politics before, it’s that now, it doesn’t seem I can’t have a descent conversation with her without her making things political or some form of political statement, which for the years I’ve known her, seems just oddly out of character.

New posts of my cousins on her instagram has since been steadily replaced by political memes and similar sorts. And I’m just afraid she may getting her news from the wrong news sources based off some of the accounts that appear to follow and the information she reposts in her story. 


Even after asking her if we can change subjects, or when we move the conversation about something else. It appears that she has to add her two (political) 2 cents per say. I recently found out that since the whole COVID and George Floyd events she had extreme stress (she was also moving at the time to Washington during the protests riots) so much so she had psoriasis effecting her. I’m aware she has had medication for anxiety before (which I’m not sure if she is still taking) and has gone to therapy due to marriage issues and for herself. Who she has stopped since moving to Washington. 

But I can’t tell if this is just a sign of the times to which she’s expressing her politics, or again, something more that I should maybe tell her to seek counseling/ therapy for? 

Again, it’s just in these past few months with her moving and the whole political climate, that I just don’t seem to recognize this person anymore. Just a lot of out-of-character actions and conversations with her since she moved. I can use some guidance on how I should talk to her about this.",13Oct2020,1

136,"In my early teens I was bullied intensely every single day in a gym class where no teachers would listen to me or do anything to stop the bullying. Staff would listen to me, then the  bullies would get talked to, then they’d act like the real victims, and then I’d end up looking like not only a troublemaker but the bullying would intensify and teachers would listen to me less.

My parents ever since I was a child would constantly check up on me and make sure I was meeting their unrealistically high standards. If I didn’t meet their expectations, I would have to deal with them acting like I was the perpetrator and I was somehow unloving or unthankful for withholding the truth of my actions when every time I shared the truth I was met with disdain and harshness and got grounded for the silliest things.

All throughout my life I’ve had friends who take actions to ruin my life by accusing me of things, berating me, laughing at and dismissing me, and as soon as I accuse them of hurting me they’ve already got everyone on their side and play the victim card. I’ve lost many friend groups to this behaviour and every time I’ve felt completely unable to garner sympathy or defend myself.

After all of these years of being unable to defend myself, I have an almost traumatic anxious response if someone begins to question me. I feel like I should cave in and give up, because in the past I’ve never been able to defend myself, assholes who want to prey on the weak just always win, I always lose. It’s just luck and a matter of time. Even when people aren’t around, I feel like I constantly need to justify myself and my actions. If I do something I want to do or like, I have to explain to myself why I’m allowed to first. It’s like I’ve ingrained the cycle of gaslighting into my own head and now I can’t tell when my problems are real and when I’m making them up. 

My parents know that I feel this way and now they say that my trauma is impacting my decision making skills. A year or so ago I came out to them as trans, or with feelings I might be, and so they framed it as me making up feelings and thoughts to deal with trauma. They didn’t believe me, so I didn’t believe myself, and I can’t shake it now that I could just be making all of these feelings up to overcome gaslighting in some way... even though I don’t feel like I’m crazy I think I might be because I can’t prove I’m not, and I’m so used to having to defend myself that in cases like this in my life where things aren’t obviously real and tangible I have to battle with self doubt. 

I just wish there was a way to get over all of this self-questioning and feeling like I have to be constantly 100% justified in my actions. I feel like I have to be perfect and anxious all the time because if I don’t keep myself in check I’ll be insane and make wrong decisions and not be a functional person. How to I get over this fear? How do I overcome this trauma from the past? How can I learn to trust my own feelings when I’ve been constantly disenfranchised and invalidated with no way to defend or prove myself? Does it sound like trauma or like I’m making it up? I don’t have symptoms of ptsd like constant memories and avoidance but I think I have trauma from these things, if that makes sense..

149,"Good morning,

this is my first time posting to this sub and I don't know if this is the right place or not be here goes.

I believe I am having a mental breakdown.  I googled my symptoms online. Essentially what I am feeling is a great sense of dread about my future. I have been having suicidal thoughts and general self loathing. This really isn't new because I suffer from suicidal ideation but I haven't been having those thoughts in some time.  I been having weird bouts of mood swings where sometimes I can be happy for 5 minutes then anger and sadness throughout most of the day. I am consumed by my thoughts and I can't take any pleasure in a few things that used to make me happy. I also feel a bit of physical discomfort (mainly in my chest) and I've felt a bit lightheaded, but this isn't as frequent. I have received calls from family and friends but I can't bring myself to text them or call them back; part of me is ashamed of myself and I don't want them to see me until I am my old gregarious self.

A lot of things have happened to lead me here so I will cover what I can in different paragraphs.

**Dating**

In late April I decided to get back onto the online dating scene. I was getting any luck with a few of the sites until I got Hinge in July. I found I was getting a lot of success with this app and was excited to meet a potential partner. I got ghosted a few times and some of the dates I scheduled fell through and others just didn't work out. In August I found a girl I meshed with very well and after a month I realized I liked her a lot. We went on several online dates and I thought we had a good connection but she decided to break it off early October. I was saddened by this but I didn't feel too bad as I started talking to another girl who meshed well with me. We had a date Thursday October 08 and I thought it went alright. We texted very frequently but on October 09 she didn't text me at all and I immediately assumed she was ghosting me. I sent her a follow up text on October 10 asking if things were alright and I haven't received a text back. This makes me feel unwanted and I believe this was the main driver behind my breakdown.

**Living situation**

I have been living with my mom, brother and grandmother for several years. in 2017 my brother decided to move out for school and my mom shouldered most of the responsibility with the house and my grandmother's health. I want to point out that living with my grandmother is difficult as she can be emotionally abusive at times (mostly to my mother). In May of this year my mother told me she was going to be moving out with her friend in late August, leaving me alone with my grandmother. I didn't like this arrangement at all but accepted it. Thankfully my brother decided to move back home in September and he has been a great support. Despite this, my grandmother will only come to me whenever there are any issues and she won't ask my brother for any help at all. I do not like speaking with my grandmother and she usually calls me 8 times a day to either ask me to do something for her or to talk badly about my mother. on Friday October 09, my grandmother presented me with 2 letters from the mail. Each contained a bill from our heating company and the heating company. Both bills add up to roughly $2,000.

**Work**

I have a good job but ever since the pandemic started I have been more stressed than usual. I have made several mistakes and I am paranoid that my coworkers think less of me for this. I have been pressured to do better with work but I am not performing as well as I should and my manager discussed this with me on Wednesday October 07. The breakdown happened on Friday October 09 and this definitely affected my performance. I had very little motivation to continue working and I did the bare minimum.

Anyways that's how I got to this point. Nothing has really changed and I want to get better but I don't know how.",13Oct2020,1
150,"I'm a female, who just turned 21 two days ago. I would say my mood rapidly changes. Some days in a week I can feel so much down that I have unstoppable crying, doesn't eat anything, doesn't get enough sleep ect. Those days I usually end up with thinking about death and suicide - I would even say if it wasn't because I was afraid of doing it, I might even accomplish it one day, as I'm unable to handle my emotions. But some days I feel so happy and energetic, and get more things done in a day - It is like I'm in my own little fantasy world full of joy and excitement. Usually when I have positive days, I don't think about dark subjects,but recently I sometimes think about death and suicide too when I'm happy - And not in a negative way. It's like I'm feeling that there is something waiting for me on the other side, and I can't wait to see it, like maybe a whole new world.

I wanna know if any of you guys feel the same way or have heard of anything similar before",13Oct2020,1
151,At this point I know things can potentially get better...i just don’t care anymore. I don’t want to see another year. On my dresser i have my crossbow sitting there and I’m constantly contemplating rather I should shoot myself in the head or not. I know I could potentially just end up paralyzed but I don’t care. I would rather take the risk than see another year.,13Oct2020,1
152,"Honestly, this is only the most recent event in a long through history of trauma, I often realize of late that I underestimate just how much I've been through when I speak to others, mention some relatively mild instance of abuse and shock them into silence. But this, this is the worst of them all. She was the select specimen of all things excellent and lovely I am capable of assigning to the nature of humankind. 

She was the only being that even knew me, the only close relationship other than one friend, who shortly after had a broken engagement, decided it was okay to screw sixth graders, and is thus no longer a friend. I don't know how to begin to forge a close bond with anyone else. Those things take years, and I so long to have a connection to another the like of what has been lost to me, but I know I cannot form new relatuonships like this. Grief is offputting to others, if I speak truthfully I only push them away.

So I am just trapped in this barrier field, in the fragments of a broken life, tending the funerary shrine that is my home, waiting for my turn for ceasessuon from existence as my own chronic illness slowly grows worse. The only family that are not my past abusers or their enablers live several states away. The local cultural environment is very military centric, and thus ostracizing to one such as myself.

This outbreak has destroyed my access to social gatherings nearly entirely, aside from the BDSM group I see a couple times a month. I know well what thou wouldst suggest, therapy. However, there are too many cognitive behaviouralists in the field and that style is unhelpful to me. The nearest Jungian analyst is about four hours drive away.

I have my enjoyments, have stayed active in my hobbies, academically achieving, fill my belly, wear fresh linens, and bathe. It is specifically social fulfillment which alludes me. Other than the aforementioned activities a few times each month, nobody ever speaks to me. Nobody understands me, I am struggling to reconnect to humanity. 

I wouldn't dare kill myself, I made promises before she passed. Though I have considered taking enough LSD to completely destroy my ability to interact with the world, possibly interconnecting all the memories I have of her and living in a happy delusion. Though there is a lot of trauma in the halls of my mind and the possibility of a nightmare I can never wake up from stays my hand for the time.

I've tried posting here before in not so many words and recieved no reply. I hope, maybe I just posted at a time of the day with little activity. People seem chatty at the time, so I'm just reaching out again to see what shakes loose. Advice, support, suggested distractions, something, anything.",13Oct2020,1

154,"Hey yall, my brother has borderline personality disorder and I'm trying to get him to move back home. My parents are currently paying for everything where he is living and attending college, they're happy to do this as long as he makes some sort of effort to try and graduate

The problem is he hasn't gone to class all semester and won't do anything to try and graduate, even openly telling me he never wants to go to class again. All of my family id fine with this, even ok with him dropping out completely, but it just doesn't make sense for us to keep paying his amenities and rent out where he attends school when its so far away from his family, which is his really only support system.

Hes openly talked about not wanting to go home, but almost all points he makes are also the same that he complains about where he lives, (social anxiety, community political views, ect.) Also hes said several times he no longer feels comfortable in his own apartment.

I'm asking for advice here, how can I help convince him to come back home. He has no roots where he is, no resources, no desire to work out here or anywhere, no established therapist or medicine, but I just know he'll kick and scream all the way home, what can I do?",13Oct2020,1
155,"I don’t know if it’s because I use insurance for my sessions, but I’ve started therapy 3 different times, and all times they just focused in on one central issue, and how to deal with the basics of anxiety, and gave me a full diagnosis by the first (yes first) session or the second one.

Is therapy truly not ever like “in the movies”? In tv therapists actually ask about what’s going on in a persons life, their relationships, family, jobs, and eventually delve into their childhoods or underlying issues. I’ve never experienced anything close to that. On a next session they don’t even ask about what happened over the last week.

This feels unhelpful to me because if I don’t bring up every single issue in the first session, anytime I try to bring up something else I’m feeling, it seems like they try to steer the conversation back to the “main issue”.

For example in my first session my therapist asked me to make a list of things to remember when I’m feeling anxious, and one of the things I listed was about something I hadn’t just mentioned to her that I would feel anxious about, when she read the list back to me and got to that one, she just kind of looked at me like “??? Um okay” and went back to talking about the other ones. It was very uncomfortable.

My main question is, has this been anyone else’s experience? Is the quality of my therapy because I’m not paying a fortune for it or is there some other type I should be looking for?",13Oct2020,1
156,"Just got told by the girl I fell inlove with this summer that she is not ready and does not want to continue our dating. Basically she broke up with me and offered friendship.   
I had sex addiction back in the days and I was clean for about a year now. The news broke my heart, on top of it, I found out that I do not perform well on my new job and I might be on my way out.   
I stopped thinking for a second, grabbed the phone and went to the first random prostitute I had saved in my contacts.   
I only feel worse now. My will to live is less than 0 and I am overwhelmed. My mind is going into a overdrive over what I have just done and honestly I feel like ending it.   
It's been a wild wild summer for me and if I'm lucky enough and I don't get in trouble over reigniting my payed sex addiction I would never EVER resort to this ever again.   
Please let me know if you can suggest a healthier way to cope that doesn't lead me to suicidal thoughts.   
I would be very very thankfull.",13Oct2020,1
157,"Can't function atm lol. How do I provide evidence of my anxiety? Mental health stuff is on my medical record and the service I'm on is technically a diagnosis, so if I tell him my symptoms and that it's ruining my life that should be enough right?",13Oct2020,1
158,"Honestly, from the posts I’ve read on here, my problems really are minuscule but idk, I felt like sharing incase anyone else is in my position. Also, I don’t really have anyone to speak about this to, so I think it might be healthy to vent a bit.

I had been dating this girl for 3 years, and she seemed perfect. Literally, I can’t lie, she was perfect. I really loved her, and I still do. Except, she lived 630 miles away. From me to her, was a 12 hour non stop drive. On top of that, I was the only one who was able to see her, she couldn’t come visit me. I made efforts to visit her 5 times in between these 3 years. Ig that’s one big reasoning for me feeling she wasn’t putting any effort. After the 2nd year, she started making me really feel bad about myself in multiple ways. Something small is that I’d remind her constantly how gorgeous she was everyday, but she never really complimented me at all. I started growing out facial hair, and I felt more confident with it, but she would just say ew and in result I’d stop sending her pictures. For the past 3 years, we’d call EVERY NIGHT, and after the 2nd year, she never picked up the phone happy to hear me. It made me sad knowing that talking to her was my favorite part of my day, but it always sounded like it was her worst. 

I thought it might’ve been a phase, and I kept telling myself that for months. But it just got to the point where days were really just repeating. We started fighting more and more. At some point I stopped caring about fighting. We’d get into an argument, and I’d just let it go. This, made her even more mad. She got mad I didn’t want to fight? I confronted her so many times on how I felt, but nothing changed. I went from someone who was really happy waking up everyday to just eh. Idk how to describe it. Everything just felt the same and there wasn’t anything bringing me happiness. And one day, we got into a fight over something really small, and I decided that was it. It wasn’t worth it anymore.  I broke up with her. It took me so many days to finally delete all the photos, to put away the reminders of her. Everything in my life really revolved around her at this point. The car I got, the degree I’m working on was for a job that I’d be able to find easily near her, I even got my credit and everything built just for our future. Everything I did was for her. And once she was gone, wow. I felt ruined. It was only 2 months ago but jesus christ it’s been a long 2 months. I started binge eating and I couldn’t sleep at all, especially since I was so used to sleeping on the phone with her. I’d spend my nights awake until 5 or 6am, only having an hour or two of rest. I’m not saying at all I was the perfect boyfriend, I don’t think anyone truly is perfect in a relationship. But I really wish she just tried a bit more. 

Of course not everything’s normal, I don’t think it will be for awhile. But, I started forcing myself to sleep early, around 10pm. I never slept this early before, ever, and it’s really made me feel a bit more energized. Ontop of that, I rejoined the gym. I used to enjoy going to the gym a lot but I stopped somewhere mid relationship with her due to an accident I got into where I got 2nd degree burned on my left hand. Idk, those are two small things I’ve started doing recently that’ve helped me feel a bit better. Not anything crazy at all but hopefully its a start.",13Oct2020,1
159,"I’m just going to come out and say it, I have awful mental health. If you look through my post history you will see that my mental health and self esteem is almost as awful as my personality. I know I have OCD, Anxiety, and Depression, and I know I need to reach out and open up about how I feel in order to feel better, but there just this voice in my head saying “Shut up and stop being a little bitch, you just want attention. No one should care about you and you don’t even have any mental illnesses, it’s all something you’ve made up for attention. Everyone has problems to deal with and you know they don’t want to hear about yours.” I don’t know how to stop it. All I want is to feel happy again but the voice won’t let me. It just keeps telling me that I’m overreacting or I’m crazy, and I’m starting to believe it. I’m scared, I’m going deeper and deeper into this endless void while spiraling on the way down, I don’t think I’m worthy of anything anymore and I just don’t want to bother or worry anyone. How do I stop it? Someone please tell me how I stop the voice and become happy again.",13Oct2020,1
160,"Hi there. 

Obligatory, this is a throwaway, I dont want it associated with my main. 

Anyways, I'm just trying to figure out at what point do you seek professional help for depression and anxiety issues? I think what I'm really looking for here is for someone to tell me to make that call to the doctor, but anxiety keeps making me put it off. 

I've spent more than half my life dealing with chronic illnesses. I was diagnosed as a kid, and know that dealing with all of this has messed me up mentally. I was put on cipralex for anxiety and depression when I was first diagnosed with my chronic illnesses at 12. I've been on it for over 13 years now, and starting to think its not working anymore. I also have OCD and suspect I have PTSD from all of the medical things I've been through. 

I've recently had several surgeries to assist with my chronic illnesses. That in combination with having to stay at home during this pandemic due to being high risk, has made all this feel worse.  

I'm tired all the time, I dont find interest in the things I used to, I feel like crying at the drop of a hat, and I am regretting so many of my life's decisions. I am not suicidal, more just so very tired of feeling this way. 

My biggest issue is working up the courage to make the call to my doctor for help, and the guilty feeling that some people have it worse off than me mentally and they should be given the slot in the system that I would be taking. 

Thanks for any encouragement or advice you can give.",13Oct2020,1

164,"(These are not mood swings, I do have them, but this is much different.)

This is going to be a shit show to type out so let’s get this over with. I have a problem. I switch in and out of these “personalities” at a crazy level. The good one and the scary one. 

The good one: I feel good when like this. As in a comfort good. I like to be overly enthusiastic, upbeat, humorous and be friendly. I’ll dress up, go places but do very bad in school and work.

Scary one: But then I become this thing... My confidence goes through the roof to the point where I am extremely homicidal. I plan murders, get off to dead bodies, encourage bad behavior.
Etc. I become so consumed by some sort of dark nature that I have/ will cut open my own wrists to watch it profusely bleed. It makes me feel like some sort of twisted god. Its makes me so happy and excited. 

In both of these moods I feel as if I am totally different. Someone else. I can’t control them and they just happen. But I don’t forget what I do when I change moods. I remember everything. Apart of me is in both but it’s suppressed so much it’s as if I am a different being. I hate it. 

I have lost so so many friends but they become fond of one form and I slowly change into a totally different person. I’ve been through therapy, talked to people, I’ve smoked, drank, tried drugs, self harmed everything. It’s just me, both of those strange personalities.",13Oct2020,1

I'm so fucking tired and maybe I should just quit. Maybe all the reasons to stay alive aren't worth it, aren't enough. Because at this point, why should I force myself to stay alive. Don't I have the right to choose? To choose to take my own life?",13Oct2020,1

167,"I get some social anxiety but nothing too crazy or extreme. Just at events and meeting new people but I don't think it's any worse than anyone else.
However, so many people I know say they get anxious at the same things I do, yet they always hang around people often and are much more social then I am, or seem to always choose being with people over being alone, like being alone is a bad thing .
I'm pretty chatty, and I'm very comfortable with myself when talking to someone. I really don't care what people think of me I'm pretty relaxed in conversation with anybody most of the time. I enjoy good chats and conversations with people. 
But i will always choose to be on my own over being with anyone else - with the exception of my girlfriend.
I live with some roommates and I'll always wait until I hear them go out of out the kitchen before I'll go in there to make food because I just don't want to have to talk and make conversation with them.
I guess that means I see it as effort so maybe it is an anxiety thing? 
I always feel guilty for doing that too because I don't want to feel like I'm better than anyone else but I don't feel like I'll gain from talking to anyone for the most part. Its just effort.
When I'm asked to go to a social event (even pre covid) I'll pretty much have decided no in my head as soon as they ask it and will try think of an excuse. This always makes me feel guilty and I know that I'm lucky to have people who want to hang out with me because I could easily have nobody.

174,"I've always been a jealous person. Like very much so. I also have anger issues so that's quite a fun combo. For a while I've noticed I get really upset and angry when I hear about people going through teenage rites of passage, which I recognize is a weirdly specific thing to hate but bear with me. I'm talking like going to parties, prom, having friends, and losing virginity (probably the biggest one for me). I can't watch any teen-related movies or TV without getting pissed off for this reason. I'm assuming I have this reaction because I feel like I missed out on all of that. I never went to a party, skipped prom, didn't have a group of friends, and I have kind of a weird relationship with virginity. I did some experimenting with girls in high school (I'm a girl) and had no interactions with boys till college. Even then, I did a lot of messing around before it actually came to sex so it didn't really feel like an event when it happened. And when you consider whether or not lesbian sex counts as losing your virginity, it's hard to define when it even happened for me. I just feel like so many people had a cute relationship and there was a lot of build up to it and it was awkward but sweet and that's the general narrative that I hear. I don't know why I get so attached to that idea because I'm sure it didn't happen that way for a lot of people. I'm currently in a relationship with someone who had somewhat of that standard experience and I get super jealous of that.

I feel like this whole thing is silly and it's stupid to dwell on it, but I just feel like I missed out on so much of growing up. A lot of it was that I overthought everything, planned out and anticipated every bit of my life to the point where I couldn't enjoy it and everything that did happen felt underwhelming because my standards were so high. I'm in a great situation now, but still can't seem to get over how it feels like I wasted the first 20 years of my life. For context, I'm in my early 20's now and I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder.

I don't want to encourage this or stop anyone from trying, I just wanted to share my experience so far. With regards to anxiety, it's been good for a while anyway because of meds and then I don't go near triggers anymore seeing as I don't do anything. I also don't get anxious about health anymore because I genuinely just don't care about it, if something might kill me then great. I don't care if I embarrass myself in public, don't get dressed properly, sort my hair, I don't even brush my teeth being completely honest. I quit my benefits, I have no income, no money but who cares because I don't do anything. I have no life, except this time I've stopped caring and trying to get one.

I'm close to suicide, sure but I'm constantly contemplating like my family's reaction and when best to do it and how etc and tbh I've accepted that when the money runs out and I have nowhere to live and that, then I can separate from them and they'd never know I'd gone.

I'm angry I don't care, but I'm also numb, so who knows what I do or don't feel. Does this mean all those meds I keep taking aren't working? No idea, and you know what? Who cares.

I can't even be bothered to put up the facade of being happy and ok to my family anymore. I'm lonely but I don't care, I love my ex still and I know I would love to be with him again but I've just lost the will to try. I've stopped trying and I know that even if I did try, I'll be in the same situation in months to come.

It is literally liberating in many ways. I don't do anything so it's not like oh I can do stuff now, but I don't cry anymore or let things bother me. I'm a robot, and you know what? I don't see this ever changing.",13Oct2020,1

179,"So, a bit of story-time here. When I was in Kindergarten - elementary school me and my parents used to sit at a campfire on chairs, with blankets and some stuff to eat (and cook above the fire) + drink.
Today, we wanted to do it again after almost 4 years. My grandparents came over because it was my dad's birthday a few days ago, no porblem there....right? We ended up sitting in the little cottage in our garden with a heater. I was fine with that but..No one talked to me. I'm used to be talked over but..I was the one who wanted to do the campfire. I said there listening not being able to say anything. Then, what also bothered me was no one joined me when I started cooking some sausages above the fire. I stood there, alone, in the cold for 20 minutes. Just to go back inside, eat and do the same thing again. No one cared. They just talked and drank beer, ignoring me.  My mother eventually wanted to cook something too so I joined her. Dhe started complaining about how she doesn't like this either. She told me I could leave and I did. What's the point of family-time if we're not doing anything together? I don't know. I'm sitting inside, hungry because my dad didn't make any food. He just brought out the frozen food which takes 20-30 minutes to be cooked with the fire. I just made myself instant ramen but now i'm crying because I thought this would be super fun. Why does nothing ever go as planned? Why do they ignore me? Why do I always have to be the one to sit here alone? I hate this. I hate this so much. I just want everything to dissapear.",13Oct2020,1

181,"I feel like I should share some of my story. My life turned upside down nearly in 2017 when I was 16 and since then I have been struggling with more and more issues in my life, I've seeked counciling, spoke to psychologist and took medication and still doing all these to this day. How everything began was My mum had recently got out of a relationship and got a new boyfriend in a few weeks, then sbe decided we were going to move in with him. My sister and I both disliked him for good reasons and asked out mum to not move on with him. Soon afterwards I began experiencing mental health issues due to being forced into someplace I didn't want to be in, being stuck with someone i hated, being unable to do anything and the major family issues that started up. My mental health issues began with some panic attacks in class then I couldn't stay in class, then I wasn't able to leave my house all in the space of a little over a month, next I couldn't go anywhere there were people and i began experiencing depression. I called my school and explained that I will have to stop going because of my mental health, thus cutting my education off at the middle of year 10. I then started seeing a psychologist but nothing worked and in the space of the rest of the year I drifted further apart from others, my feelings, my social life and the world around me and was kept stuck at home feeling like a prisoner held with justice to my own suffering. My mental health still continued to get worse, I got more and more depressed, anxious, agitated, had sudden mood changes, forgot how to express emotion, soon stopped feeling anything and startes getting very prominent feelings of existential dread. In 2018 I started online schooling, however this online school hardly taught anything. From 2018 to the end of 2018 i don't know specifics of what happened but i know it was yet again anither painful year of suffering and i got no better, I only got worse and the next year after I also got worse. At the beginning of this year I chose to go to a proper school on campus after two year of online schooling, and that school is the school I'm still going to now. It didn't start good I still had anxiety being in class, being near other students, being on the train, thinking of going to school, thinking of talking to other people and many other things that caussd me anxiety, I talked to my GP and asked them to give me a strong dose of anti anxiety and depression drugs and for a month they worked and then things fell apart again. Since then I've dropped some courses and arranged to have my courses on only three days of the week not five like before to avoid social anxiety as much as possible. During this year the biggest thing that caused me anxiety was going on the train to school, which is a 80 minute train ride and I have no other way of getting there. And since this year because of how everday I was experiencing so much anxiety, depression ans dread my mental health only got worse and soon I started thinking about suicide and giving up on everything. Bringing me to now where I got so many issues going on in my mind I can't count them with both hands and any aspect of my life causes me too feel anxious, depressed, dread, guilt and heart break. I'm still doing what I can to help myself but mothing seems to be working.",13Oct2020,1
182,"It is just as the title says. I live in Nigeria and I'm a student and I don't have access to a psychiatrist. My parents would think it is a waste of money and time because like a lot of people in Nigeria they think mental disorders or non existent. I believe I have a mental disorder but I don't know what type that's why I have come here to ask for help. I shall mention what I experience and I hope that someone here would be able to help me.

1. I suffer from depression and I get suicidal thoughts. Even as I'm typing this post I'm thinking about killing myself and I don't know why I have these thoughts but I just do, it just keeps flowing into my head always. I also suffer from depression and I've been called an attention seeker and a liar whenever I tell people about it so I don't know if I truly suffer from depression. My chest hurts and it feels like there's a gaping hole in my chest like I've lost some part of me. Sometimes it's minor and I can carry out my normal tasks and sometimes it's severe. During these severe episodes I feel so empty that I want to feel any form of love but unfortunately It doesn't come. 

2. Whenever a family member or a relative goes out and I happen to be in the house, if they take too long I start to get these thoughts. I begin to think that they have met some tragic end and are dead, for some reason I get scared and I feel like they aren't coming back.

3. I get mood swings. At times I feel as if I want to help everyone and do a lot of good to everyone and I hate to see people suffer, looking at a beggar makes me feel heart broken and it makes me wish that I had a lot of money so that I can lift that person from their life of poverty. 
Suddenly from feeling all helpful, I could start hating everyone and everything wanting them all to die. I believe it's because of this thing that I have hard time making some decisions it'd be like there are two persons with different views clashing in my head. 
 Another thing is my anger. Although I'm very difficult to piss off, once I do get angry my head goes blank and I am consumed by rage and such rage comes with muderous thoughts, the last time I got really angry was last year and it was at my cousin... Honestly if my brother wasn't nearby I would have killed the woman because the only thing I could think of was smashing her head on the wall.

185,"Hello everyone, 

I (M 21) am posting on a throwaway account partly because I am still partly ashamed of my emotional/mental state. I apologize beforehand, as this is going to be a longer post.

I live in California and have been working grocery since I graduated high school. I have worked two jobs and gone to school full time without a break for the last 3-3 1/2 years. Since COVID, I have had to drop school to focus entirely on work. I plan on going back. On top of that, I have been tasked with taking care of my youngest brother (13) for the last 6 months without much support financially. All of these things have taken me over the top. I cannot sleep without night terrors, I have lost my appetite, and I am usually feeling fatigued or incapacitated by a migraine. I have started to have panic attacks on a consistent basis while at work or on my way to work.

After a bad panic attack at work, in front of many customers, I finally started to see a therapist. A month of seeing this therapist regularly, I decided that I needed to take a month or two off of work. I swallowed my pride and asked my therapist to sign off on the paperwork. He told me he would, but that the FMLA office wouldn't accept it. He suggested that I go see a physician. I talked to my physician who told me that he couldn't help me and referred me to a psychiatrist. During the intake for the psychiatrist, I was told that all the in network therapists/psychiatrists were booked until early November. When I asked about signing off a note for leave, I was told that ""We don't really do that here, unless you're in one of more intense programs"". I bit the bullet and am currently awaiting a referral for an out of network psychiatrist. I also signed up for a coping class through my insurance.

I talked to the FMLA office for options because at this point, I truly felt like no one could help me. They told me I could get a note after I took my leave and it would cover everything. They suggested I try a physician again, explaining all my physical symptoms.

Today, I had that appointment. I explained to a different doctor about the past appointments and the struggles I have been having. I explained that work has done nothing but agitate these problems. He noted that I have been trying everything and prescribed me Prozac. He did not want to sign a note for me to cover leave. 

I am honestly at a loss. I don't know what to do. Am I just blindly jumping through hoops? I have no desire to take Prozac (or amy medication), but it seems to be the only option that is available to me. I am training to become a meat cutter while I go to school, and do not want to quit my job. Has anyone here taken stress leave in California? If you have, would you be willing to share your story? This isn't going to be a vacation for me. It is to help me focus on my diet, get my blood pressure way down, and start a healthy lifestyle. That also includes working on being emotionally and mentally well. I want to take a step back and re evaluate what I'm doing with my life because I haven't ever stopped working (in school or actual work). Part of me knows it is ok to try and recharge, but the other half of me it totally ashamed to even try. The constant shut down by medical professionals has amplified this feeling of shame. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this

While I’m thankful to be alive I’m just frustrated and depressed over it. I loved my car and I was blinded by the sun and couldn’t see ahead of me that there was a small car accident that I turned big. Thankfully no one was hurt but it’s just hitting me, everything I’ve done with my car all for it to just be totaled ...",13Oct2020,1
187,"I’m at my wit’s end. Earlier this summer I fell deeply in love with a woman I’d been speaking to for months on the internet during quarantine. We had a ton of things in common, great chemistry, and had so many feelings of “she’s the one”. Due to her getting kicked out by her parents unexpectedly (presumably because they figured since she was now in a relationship and had a place to go), and her now being unable to afford the new apartment she had lined up in the spring, she ended up moving in with me after less than 2 months. I’m usually one to take things slow so all of this was really new and unexpected, but I’ve been SO depressed and lonely and this was so exciting, I finally felt like I was going to be happy. 


But the issue is that I still live in my childhood home to help support my mother (she’d lose the house without me so I’ve just stayed on, and with my own mental health struggles being alone seemed like a bad idea.) But when my gf moved in…there were issues. My mom is a low-level hoarder and very messy, while my gf is hyper organized and may even have OCD. At first I was glad to finally get rid of a lot of shit and organize the house, but my mom was not pleased. 


We had a number of blow ups and tension between the two of them and me and my mom grew. My gf has PTSD from past abuse and these blow ups sensitized her to my mom making her believe she was abusive. She is also VERY uncomfortable and triggered by things I find annoying, but benign—like my mom often hovers and without realizing it talks to me like I’m a kid, which she also does to my gf now. Not to mention, even though my gf organizes things my mom ends up converting back to how they were because that’s her default. GF seems to think this is a subtle “fuck you” to her from my mom, when it’s just her living as she always has!


My mom HAS actually changed a number of things and past some initial anger and upset been reasonable and amenable. My gf on the other hand has become so sensitized she now goes into a tailspin of panic and rage attacks if my mother so much as asks what we’re cooking or if there’s a few pots left on the stove. She’s so used to being a victim she sees malice in everything and has in general, been mean to my mom who is typically very kind and understanding, and everyone always loves her. But my gf is so legitimately distressed and interpreting this as trauma it’s…awful. She seems to not understand how she’s being unreasonable or overreacting, and that she actually owes my mom a lot right now.


But we can’t leave (individually or together), and can’t afford therapy. Since coronavirus my hours and wages were more than cut in half, and my gf's previously successful business has been COMPLETELY gutted, so she makes almost no money other than unemployment and hasn’t been able to stir up more work. We are stuck here together and everyone is suffering mentally. My gf and mom now basically can’t even be in the same room, my gf barely sleeps (and if she does it’s in the day), my mom is taking Xanax, and I feel like I’m being torn apart. And my gf’s constant berating and bitching about my mom and her lifestyle is really upsetting me and pushing me away from her. I love her so much, and I love my mother, and I needed this to work so bad. I was SO happy from May-August. Now I just want to kill myself again like I have for years. (And no, I’m not doing it, I’m just saying how I feel.) 


TLDR: My new gf and I were forced to live with my mom because of coronavirus and now everyone is deeply miserable. We can’t afford therapy or to live apart and my relationship with both of them is suffering.",13Oct2020,1

I'm dealing with anxiety and anger issues and finally working up the courage to see someone about it.

I have seen psychiatrists/therapists in the past to varying success, but on the whole have not found the process to be very helpful.

190,"So ever since middle school I've had a constant struggle with my own self image. From then to this day I never really knew what I looked like. And now it seems it's only gotten worse. Its to the point where every single picture of me and every single mirror of me looks almost like a whole different person. There'd be mirrors where I feel actually pretty confident, and very rarely even some selfies where I felt confident, but then I'd see a picture of myself that someone else took and I would always look unrecognizable. I would look incredibly ugly. Just completely different.

So for years I've been in this constant internal struggle of not really knowing what I look like. Do I look like what I see in most mirrors and selfies? If so, I'm happy. Or do I look like how I see myself in pictures that other people take? If so, I'm confused, and equally, fucking devastated. Eventually I realized that what I see in selfies and the mirror is an inverse of the actual angle people see me as. Which lead me to believe the pictures were actually accurate. But I eventually learned all the factors that make pictures inaccurate, so I found out that apparently the best way to see how people see you is to put two mirrors at a 90° angle beside each other, and the image in the middle is how people really see you. So I did it.

I was horrified. In that mirror I was objectively one of the ugliest looking people I've ever seen. I looked nothing like what I see in a regular mirror and selfie, I mean absolutely nothing. I looked closer to how I do in regular pictures, but even still it somehow looked worse. One of the biggest things that made me look so different was just how asymmetrical I looked. Now I know everyone is asymmetrical, and even when I look at regular mirrors I can see my asymmetry, but it's not that bad, really it only seems like it's my jaw/chin, but more than anything, it looks normal, I looked normal. But when I see myself in photos that people take of me, and in that 90° mirror, I look fucking horrific. My right jaw bone looks like it's been pushed to the right far too much, my chin looks like it's been pushed to the left, and my left eye looks so much higher than my right one. And if that's apparently how I look to other people then I'm a freak.

But that's the thing, I've seen my friends and other people in both the mirror and then in person, and there almost isn't a single difference. Sure, things will be inverted in the mirror, but overall they look the exact same. But how the fuck can I go from looking normally asymmetrical like everyone else in the mirror, but then look completely fucking different in the way that everyone apparently sees me? Which is actually the most correct, like how do other people see me? Do they see me as just an inverse of what I see in the mirror? Or do they actually see me as I saw in the 90° mirror? Obviously you can't really answer that unless I posted pictures which I would do if it helps answer at all.

This is my constant struggle I've had, I feel like I'm stuck between the look that I see in the mirror and selfies, which I'm relatively happy with, and the look I see in photos other people take of me and that 90° mirror. And I would think I would think how I actually look would just be an inverse of what I see in the mirror. But when I do the 90° mirror to see what I apparently really look like, it's not just an inverse of how I see myself in the mirror, I look like an entirely different person. Which makes no fucking sense because literally every person that I've seen in person and in the mirror has looked pretty much the exact same, but I don't? How is that even possible?

So my question is, is my BDD really just making me imagine that I'm that asymmetrical? Can it seriously get that bad that I'm basically just hallucinating that I'm uglier than I really am? It's affected me nearly my whole life, but it's gotten so much worse this past year. It's to the point where I have thought about suicide. I've never done that before. But it's this constant battle inside of me of not knowing what I look like. Because if I DO generally look how I do in the mirror and selfies, then I can be at ease, there's improvement to be made, but overall I'm okay. But if I really do look like how I see myself in photos and in that 90° mirror, then I am fucking horrific looking. But if how I see myself is a result of my BDD then I can be sorta at ease but obviously I need to seek therapy or some sort of medication. I just need answers. And it seems like I can never find them.

I'm sorry to drag it on so much, it just seems like I literally have almost no other problem in my life at this point except this. And it takes up all my thoughts, I don't want to hangout with people, and I have genuinely thought of suicide because of it. I just need an answer. Thank you so much for reading, even if you don't have an answer, it really does help just to get it out there.",13Oct2020,1

I’ve been having mental health issues on and off for the past six years and have been looking for help since last November.

While I’m not demanding one, it would be helpful in terms of both finding the right meds/treatment and in trying to explain my situation to others, including any professionals, my college, and of course family/friends.

200,"I (22F) live in the USA and have an older brother (25M) who has shown concerning symptoms for the last few years. 

When he was in his early twenties he begin to act depressed and unmotivated, but he also had paranoid ideas about people. For example, if someone coughed, he read that as them dominating him. He began to act more withdrawn and quit working, saying he didn't want other people being his boss. 

 In the last couple of years, his condition has spiraled downwards. His behavior is very bizzare and nonsensical. For example, this summer he went over a week without eating and wore nothing but a loincloth while he stood or laid in the grass motionless for days. He also makes wild accusations, saying that my family is attacking him with our thoughts. Sometimes when he talks, it doesn't even make sense, you have to unscramble to words to understand what he's saying. 

He hasn't acted aggressive towards anyone, but his behavior is haphazard and careless. So far he has burned down his shack, his truck, and a horse trailer on accident and burned up a whole pile of wood even after my mom told him not to. He also demonstrates self harm behavior at times, such as when he slammed his hand in his door on purpose and had to go to the ER because he was bleeding so bad. 

He told me that he thinks he has schizophrenia, but he hasn't gotten help. I don't think he is in a sound enough mind or even organized enough to get himself help even if he wanted it. He also doesn't have transportation for it anyway. I don't live at home anymore, so I can only do so much. My mom claims that she's done all she could but I feel like she hasn't even tried yet. She could be making appointments for him and driving him there but she hasn't and doesn't care enough to even try.

When I sent her resources for help for him and she just made excuses or didn't even look at the information.

I worry about my brother all the time because he sleeps in dangerous places like homemade boxes (much like a coffin) and holes 12 feet underground because he has delusions about his energy getting stolen while he sleeps. I'm always worried that he's going to die doing these things or will die from being careless. He's already been in 12 automobile accidents and had so many other close calls.",13Oct2020,1

Into the road. it was busy. I ran Into the side of a van, and the back of a car, they were both moving. When I got home i had a massive panic attack. I’m not okay.

All my life I’ve been one of the more popular and outgoing kids and I always felt like I had a strong personality and that I never would change for anyone. More recently, I feel like it’s the opposite. I feel like I’m unable to have my own personality anymore, and it’s not that I don’t want to it’s that I literally don’t know how the me I know acts. This makes it so whenever I talk I always second guess what I’m about to say, making me a more awkward person, or at least I seem more awkward to myself. The worst part is I don’t even know how to talk to someone about this problem because it’s such a weird thing to describe that I barely could even write this post without confusing the f*** out of me.

209," I'm going to tell you the story of how it all came to be. 

I was born a vibrant spirit, yet a bit challenged. I enjoyed things like writing poetry and drawing ever since I could grab my tools to do so. Journaling has been a favorite, and people weren't so much. I always told myself that if I reject people first, they can't reject me. But I was young to even understand this at the time of my early years, and I was 'beaten to the punch' and rejected first. The first rejection I went through was by my parents. My father is a convicted pedophile (as of this month) and is expected to go to prison, for raping my sister for 13 years (from age 4). Before all this came to our awareness, we thought he was just the silent, misanthrope type. And that is not a crime while making him wildly unpleasant to be around as a person. My mother, cold frigid, controlling, manipulative, was the governess of our house, and world order. She ""picked up"" the slack when my dad didn't, for his many neglectful ways were prominent throughout my life. 

My mother, however shocking my dad and sister's story can be, is the real headline here. My mom f\* me up the most. It was very much a hot and cold treatment, 'I love you', 'I hate you', 'You're not good enough' and then back to 'I love you'. That instilled a sense of instability in me and my personality, deeming me unfit to work as an adult, keeping a job, making friends and function as an adult in a basic level. Everything and anything can set me off, and put me right in bed, where I would lay countless hours and sleep into my own personal brand of galactic oblivion. I wasn't given a reason to live, because I kept getting subliminal messages from my parents with their mistreatment that my life wasn't worth living. Neglect, gaslighting, other forms of manipulation, lack of care, silent treatments..It soon became apparent to me, (and when I say soon I mean the age of 5) that I should probably kill myself, but I had still but a small light of hope within me, that I was mistaken about this assessment, that my life was a mistake, and kept living. Surviving, but not thriving. 

I got into drawing when I was 5-6, it was my refuge where I would be left alone to my own devices as a kid in this neglectful abusive home. I would sit for hours, sketch up comics, people, weird imaginary creatures, I remember sleeping with the papercut figures and holding them. It was sort of demented, misguided, some would say it's cute, but it was definitely the manifestation of extreme loneliness. I soon started to decorate my whole room with these paper cut drawn figures, draw on my walls,  nobody cared. My room looked like an alleyway. 

Only 12, and being kicked in the stomach and ribs by a group of guys that got me drunk on a whole bottle of Vodka, only to take me to a parking lot and kick me in the ribs, I don't remember the rest, I don't remember how I got home that night, I don't remember if I was raped. Which is I assume is what you're thinking, it's plausible. My parents didn't say a thing seeing the bruises, in many ways their treatment was a continuous source of emotional bruise making so seeing an actual physical bruise didn't seem too exceptional for them. I only remember my dad, being the sexist that he is, telling me it was my fault for ""frolicking"" with men, and that that I had it coming. 

19, a series of hospitalizations in mental hospitals, I was psychotic, they finally won the war I was fighting over my mental health for so many years. I lost touch with reality, finally. To escape the trauma I endured. In a way, I still look at this time favorably, as twisted as it may sound, for the chance to escape my reality was priceless heaven at the time. But, alas, I was hearing voices, seeing demons. I tried to overdose on pills, that's what got me to the ward in the begin with. I didn't mind being there, I felt safe. But the sights I had seen will stay seared in my head for life, during this very long stay at the hospital. 

31, burned my twenties partying, isolating, having tons of sex to not feel alone, knowing very well I was never going to be loved by any of these men, and so I really wasn't. I am now unemployed (looking, searching for a job) and feel a bit more confident to ""take on the day"". I don't feel like I truly recovered, I probably never will. Nowadays, my existence feels like a grey empty cloud. Hovering over a dead body in Winter. I don't feel alive, I feel like the decisions I make are of no substance, there's nobody pulling the strings really. Just a collection of grey cells, those that are still left after many breakdowns, nothing but a machine doing its job. I used to survive not thrive, but now it feels like I'm completely dead inside. 

I decided to share my story to connect with people who may know what I'm talking about here, offer support to others and be supported. These are difficult times, more than ever those who self isolate may not feel the change in the world atmosphere, but it does get very lonely something, does it not? 

I hope you all take care x",13Oct2020,1

211,"Some backstory, all throughout my childhood I had been given severe corporal punishment (very often spankings, in my room for days, no dinner ect) for some things that weren’t so deserved as others. I admit I was a devil of a child and very stubborn, and I still am to this day, but my father (now divorced) often apologizes for how harshly they punished me as a child. Obviously I dont want my siblings to be in pain, but I have a right to be upset about how unfairly I was treated in comparison. Sometimes my mother will say I was a “test run” and sometimes she’ll say she treated me the exact same as the other kids, which obviously isnt true. I dont want to list everything thats happened to me but I have a long and personal history with domestic abuse, my parents getting divorced because of it. It left a big impression on me as a child and I tried to talk to a public school counselor about what my parents say and do to me and one another, and they looked in shock at me and called my parents, so now I have an irrational fear of therapists. My parents made fun of this and to this day condemn any showing of emotion I have, so Im quite stagnant in my responses now.

Fast-forwarding to the present day, whenever my mother and I argue its mostly one sided heat wise. I haven’t raised my voice towards her in forever although during these arguments she is prone to scream cry and make fun of me, even going so far as calling me a sociopath because Im not as emotionally unstable as her. Obviously, this would be a horribly biased post if I didnt mention everything I do to her, which is quite frankly alot. I slack off on my chores, (but still do them granted) have trouble turning in homework and dont back down in an argument when Im being slandered. I have a stubborn sense of pride that makes me, for better or worse, try to understand my mothers side and make her understand my own rather than just laying down and taking a beating. This has led to alot of conflict and several occasions where my mother has even partially disowned me, saying how she’ll give me food until I move out but we’re done as son and mother. It breaks my heart every time, but after years of being made fun of for my unstable nature, I find it near impossible to cry or show sadness whenever Im around her. Instead I just feel this devoid of emotion and tell her “You make me sad” whenever she says something that breaks my heart. She probably thinks this is me being disingenuous but I honestly mean it when I say it. She often says my siblings are so much better and stronger than me (which hurts me more than you know) whenever they havent endured half of what I have. She constantly invalidates my past whenever I say I have feelings too and tells me Im a negative person whenever I do mention something bad that happened to me to show I didnt have it so easy.

TLDR: My mom wont acknowledge my feelings and trauma filled past and acts as if its all in my head, I think I deserve better and voice my opinion",13Oct2020,1
212,"Hey, I’ll explain my situation I’ll try to keep it short but I really really need help to understand myself. 
- I was traumatized as I child
- suffer from depression in a very young age
- tried to kill myself multiple times 
- I still deal with childhood emotional neglect 
- it’s been years and I didn’t make any progress I’m my life (I’m so ambitious and I have I vision for myself) 
- I feel like I’m trapped inside my body and sometimes I don’t want to wake up 
- I don’t like my parents specially my toxic dad I don’t live with him but he’s the major reason why I’m depressed 
- my step brother and some of my cousins and uncle sexually harassed me in childhood &amp; adulthood 
- I can’t live with myself because of my culture and family it’s forbidden to us women to live ourselves 
- I’m suffering from depression like most of the time but I do have mood swings like for a week I was on my bed just crying hating my life and yesterday I was in a very good mood and life still sucks but I feel I can fix it, and today my mood is went downhill and I’m in my bed crying. 

The only reason I wrote in here is that I don’t know if I have bipolar of depression, since I’m from a very religious county is hard to find a therapist who is not basing his advices for my on religion, trust me I’ve tried and most of them are advising me to pray and get closer to god :)",13Oct2020,1

215," Hello, I am a 26 year old boy who is going through a very difficult time in his life since almost 4 years ago, at that time I felt glorious, I felt that my life had a direction, that everything was beautiful and bright, I felt loved, I felt good about myself but now that vision of things has changed dramatically.

At the moment I feel alone, very alone, perhaps I will reach that age when everyone is afraid of what will happen in the future, I suffer from a huge depression, I live in a country of shit, absolute shit, so it's understandable why my sanity can't take it anymore, 4 years ago I don't know what it is to have a girlfriend, I don't know what it is to have sex, I don't know what it is to feel loved, I don't know what it is to feel really supported, for my family I am a living disappointment, everything upsets me, stresses me, bothers me, depresses me and causes me anxiety. I'm at a point where I feel like every decision I've ever made in my life has been wrong, has been stupid, and I haven't been able to really do anything good, every day I feel sadder and more useless in this life, because when I realize that I am 26 years old and I am in a room with humids walls, a damaged fan, dying of heat, alone and without friends, because they all left this shitty country, they grew up and made their lives apart and I am no longer part of those lives, it makes me cry every day, but how can I bother them?, not knowing what I will eat tomorrow to not being able to find a solution to my disdain.

That's when I ask myself why I'm still living? What have I done wrong to deserve such a life like this? why now even one day a week I think about suicide? How bad is my mental health right now? are some of the questions I ask myself, How can I not feel depressed if I see my life pass before my eyes, when the only thing I can do to survive is to farming gold in a game like WoW, sitting in a computer 14 hours a day, praying to the god that is supposed to exist, to be able to earn $4 that day and that there is not a 10 hour power outage every day of the week, that is very common here in Venezuela, to live in the constant anguish of knowing if there will or will not be electricity today, feel amazed that you don't have enough food, because you haven't been able to ""farm"" in two weeks where there was no full electricity in every day? where you had to think whether to sleep or wait for the electricity to come back, sometimes just falling asleep because you couldn't wait any longer? This is really disgusting and I don't wish it on anyone, and if I know there are people who could be worse off than me, but right now, I want to talk about me.

What am I supposed to do when I look in the mirror and see a fat, obese man with crooked teeth, shy to talk, broke without a cent in his pocket? with a broken heart, feeling that he was left behind as a human being? feel that everything in life is based on money? that you can't restart your life if you don't have money? Seeing that no girl wants to talk to you, or even be your friend because of your looks or because you can't even afford to give her a candy bar? because the little money you made was necessarily going to buy food and no other luxury? having a damn phone with a broken screen that lasts 4 hours of battery, which crashed if you try to use two applications at the same time and BOOM restarts and you know you can never change it, because you can not and will not? thats sucks really sucks.

Talk to your family and simply be told ""you must learn to live with it, that's life"" that shit is too sad, not being able to trust your family... Call several friends, you are bathed in tears to ask them for help and to tell you ""I'm sorry but I have more important things now"", try to find someone to talk to about this and simply be told ""get away from who you are?"", What am I supposed to say or do? Is this really growing up? Is this what happens when you act badly in your life? Is this being alone?. I want to go to a psychologist but I can't, it's too expensive for me, and there I ask myself again; I am 26 years old and have nothing at all but absolutely nothing? just a PC that if I sell it I will get $120 to eat for 1 month and then what do I do? I completely hate my life, I don't want to be rich, I want peace the only thing I really want with all my heart is peace!.

But what must I do in order to achieve that peace I long for? if every step I take leads to a worse situation?, Why is it so hard for me to be happy? Why can't I achieve the goals I want in my life? How am I supposed to fight with all this? Why do I get to be so miserable?. I wish I could find the answers to every question I've put in this post i really want it.

I have tried to fight all this for a long time but whenever I do at some point I fall back again but never in my life had I reached this point in my life where I even wish not to live anymore, for me this is crazy, and I'm losing all my sanity, because I don't know what to do, I don't know who to ask for help, I don't know who to talk to, I don't know who to tell, please help me. Between tears I will only tell you that my only wish is to be able to restart my life.

Thank you very much to everyone who has read all this, I really appreciate it, I would like to know if anyone lives or lived a situation like this, I would like to make friends so I can talk about this and not feel so alone, have a good day!.",13Oct2020,1

218,"I finally found a job that I had high experience in, which at the time I was super stoked about when I applied and was offered an interview. I got the job. I did a trial shift to see how I liked it and one practice shift to actually get a feel for the place last week, followed by 5 days off before starting it today full time.  

My mental health affects how I view myself so much. This job ticked all the boxes for me to get back into the workforce since COVID but I just couldn’t do it. I thought I wouldn’t do well even though my experience is more than enough. I overthought it so much. I spent the 5 days all in some blur, that I can’t even remember what I did.

I went in today and quit.

219,"Im 25f. My boyfriend and I have been together for one month shy of a year. Ever since COVID, he's started exercising more and tracking calories, and really wanted me to do it, too. I tried, but I just wasn't at that point. Definitely not to the level he was.

Ever since my state started lockdown in March, bad things have kept happening to me and my family that have made my mental state worse. I'm struggling to function normally, but I'm really trying. I thought he understood that. But I found out that my lack of interest in diet and exercise makes him think I'm giving up on myself, and that he is not sexually attracted to me.

 I had been suspecting something was wrong for a while now, but he laid it out through text. We did talk about it in person just now, and things did not get better. We're both socially awkward people, so we sometimes rely on text to start these conversations, so I'm not mad at him for that. Here's the text he sent:

""Before I go into this know that I love you and I'm in for the long haul if you are. I love you for your personality, your glowing face, your quirky interests, your lovely cats and your wonderful voice. But when you gave up on losing weight and eating right it got harder to express that love to you physically.

I didn't want to push because, I'm here for the long run and we've got other things to take care of for getting you back on track first like your sleep difficulties. I was afraid of hurting your feelings when you're already in a vulnerable spot.""

I feel so ugly, gross, unlovable, and disappointed in myself. I know I'm a little overweight, I know I have stretch marks from when I initially gained that excess weight a few years back, I know I'm not ""sexy,"" but I thought he thought I was. I had thought things were going well. I had been getting excited about our future together. But now I feel like the work I've been doing on myself isn't enough. It's not something he can relate to. He said he wants to help me become a better person, but I don't think diet and exercise will do that for me right now. But that means he won't want to be intimate with me, which is incredibly important to me.

I don't know what to do. This is the first bad thing that's come up for us, and I wish he could understand that I haven't given up on myself. I just need more time and different kinds of self care than what he wants from me. It also scares me that he wants me to change. I know to him it seems like he's just encouraging me to be happy, but what he wants is so much more than what I can do right now.

It just hurts so much.",13Oct2020,1
220,"I let everyone down, I'm aware. Another year passed, more lessons were learned than i asked for. I feel completely betrayed by almost every person i attempted to get close to, friends n family alike have exhausted me while I've exaggerated my place in each of their lives, tho they didn't ask for that I feel like a fool. Looking back i tried to help, while making everything so much worse than before. 
I didn't mean to hurt anyone, but i also hoped maybe some could understand how they affected me too. 
I tried to make some right with the few i truly care about, but again- it was falling on deaf ears.
I wish I could hear myself talk too sometimes, i feel so dense it's numbing.

N I know i turned my back on everyone and i don't know what to say anymore. I tried to apoligize but I dont have much faith or trust in the aquantices n circles i ran in, i dont have any desire to be back to the cycles i once knew. A lot happened in these last few years, i am scared of so much..
I have this feeling like I'm not a good person, i kno we all have our days but I spend most of mine battling with my own mind, inner voice and my undefeated past for years while keeping a smile on my face.
I've made countless mistakes and my character is completely flawed, i have nothing left but doubt in myself. 
This is not forever, i know it's just a temporary flar up but it can make me feel pretty useless, or worthless in a world just existing. 
I know now how to ratanolize with these thoughts but that doesn't make it any easier-just makes things drag.
I thought getting sober would help, n it has. Turns out I hadn't acknowledged or dealt with much since all this truly began 11 years ago. 
Medicated or self medicated, i just needed someone to talk to n understand. 
Through all this my boyfriend and my mom have been amazing, knowing little of what i'm actually going tbru they always know what to say or how to help.
But now I have no desire for the friends, family or things we once did, i just want anyone who ever considered me their friend, or i hurt n never gave the chance to speak to know i love them, wish them all the best. Always will, i just need a personal break from everyone before my brain goes into over drive(not that anyone cares, or asked i guess in writing this I hope it helps me more than anyone..)  I shouldn't have to be physically present in anyone's lives to be considered a friend, my two oldest friends i see less than anyone, i dont get it.. also not that many reach out, i still understand that's ok too n i am not upset in just stuck inside myself again over analyzing every social interaction ive had in the past 5 years.

There is this part of schizoaffective disorder that has diabilitated any ability i had to socialize like I once had. The paranoia is eating me alive, no matter what i do I still think the worst of myself while thinking everyone hates me. I am the problem, i can't n wont blame anyone else for the situations i got myself into n where it led me mentally. All I can do now is try to keep that past where it lays n try to move on. 
But how? 
Seems impossible wjen everyday I get stuck in a loop, inside my head with me n everyone i want to get away from.

So i guess to combat this for now i started writing positive notes too. this being the first one, I cant escape what my mind does but i am trying like hell to see any good I have left inside me before i end up in a hospital again against my will...

 I want to be resilient. 
I want stregenth. 
I want that confidence i gained then back.
and the power to overcome myself again.
I am beautiful. I am powerful. I am talented. I am empowering. I am empowered. I am uplifting, inspiring, and admirable.
I know i have all this inside myself, i know i can be ok.
Instead of hating, instead of feeling less, i can and i will snap back n out of this. 
Nothing and no one is above me, and i refuse to let these people or places control me any longer. 
I have to close those doors, leave them locked up, burn em down w all inside and stop living within the past that helped destroy me.
I know who i am, i know the version of myself i love is in there.
I am trying so hard, or maybe not enough but i refuse to give up on myself now. 
I am beautiful, and i am much stronger n smarter than my mind gives me credit for.",13Oct2020,1

(We met on bumble on April so we couldn't go out much). However, when we talked about each other's emotions, that's when it would get bad. It got to the point where he would say nasty things about me and I would just take it to heart and beat myself up for them. He made me feel as if I wasn't a normal person. Right after him, I also had a boyfriend who did the same but with different things about me. Whatever could hurt my self-esteem the most. This would cause me to have memories of both of them, good or bad. After I broke up with my boyfriend, which was July, I would feel just fine going on with my day until I get a wave of sadness or some of the things they'd say to me will pop into my head, often times this would lead to depression, panic attacks, and overwhelming amounts of hatred to them. Recently, after 5 months when me and the first guy broke up, he wanted to text me saying he was sorry. But that apology doesn't mean much to me anymore because it ended with us fighting and he was behaving the same way. Now those feelings are back, the memories are coming more frequently, I can't focus on school or other things i plan on doing, my eating and sleeping patterns are off, I feel pain and I end up drained.

PS English is my third language so sorry about any typos and mistakes

&amp;#x200B;

Ok so anyway here is the situation at the time. I was 13 or 14 year old teenager living in Croatia at the time (can't remember exactly how old was i) and my living situation with my actual mom and step dad is reaching a boiling point because of my moms constant schizophrenic episodes caused by drugs which at the time I of course didn't understand. At the same time my dad has been released from prison after about a 4 year sentence and was working construction in Germany to earn money legitimately after his criminal past and at the same time he was working on getting a family again after shit went south with my mom. So after that my current step mom moved in to our old house with two children of her own. Some time passed and I started more and more going to my step mom and not being home. So at this point I'm 100% sure I'm 14 at least and its been a couple of months since I've started going there a lot. She also had a lot of family and all of this is all about her one niece which was 17 or 19 at the time. Lets just call her A. So then A had problems at her own home with her parent's and after some big fight she asked if she could live in our house until she gets on her feet. I didn't know anything about that. And for anyone to understand my mental state at the time you're going to need some context. I had a couple of friend but nothing huge and at time all I wanted was to just have a relationship with a female. And I mean that shit was on my mind 24/7. So one day I come to the house and some random red haired woman is sitting there and I remember that situation like it was yesterday. I came in and just greeted everyone and sat down to watch tv. And as I was sitting A tells me something in a sense why are you just silent and not speaking anything. Naturally I was shitting my pants since she was older and beautiful and there I was just a insecure teenager which is scared shitless of even talking to her. And then maybe like 30 minutes or a hour later my step mom says that she needs to go to the store to buy something. And after she went A just couldn't shut up. She went on and on just talking mostly about herself which if I was older would be a automatic red flag to stay away but as a teenager that wanted anyone no matter what I just could not see anything beyond how I was infatuated with her looks. Now I'm going to skip some not that important parts since this is already going to be long enough. Some time (2-3 of months) passed and we became really close friends. LET ME JUST REMIND YOU I WAS 14 BEING CLOSE WITH A 17 YEAR OLD AT THE TIME which is just insane in itself. So then one day A needed to go to her old place to take some stuff she didn't take before and she asked me if I want to go as well. I of course said yes. As we took that stuff and brought it back home that day when I was walking home at somewhere around midnight I realized I feel something I never felt before. Not just falling in love in someone as a kid but really loving someone. You might say there is no way a 14 year old can love someone but trust me its going to make much more sense later. So yeah some time passes and I unofficially moved in with my step mom while my dad was working. And since I was sleeping there at that point there was little space where everyone can sleep. So quite literally the first night I was there I slept on a couch which was pulled out I guess that's how you say it so that two people could sleep there and A was sleeping on a two-story bed and she comes and asks me if she could sleep with me on that bed since she said and i quote ""she was always hitting her head on the wall"" when she was sleeping on that two story bed. And then for a good year I slept with her on that couch. Oh and I also forgot to mention that A was bi but leaning more on a lesbian side and also a liar and a manipulator. So in the mean time she talks to me about everything with me. And by everything I mean EVERYTHING including relationship's and her sex life and in heavy detail. And then couple of nights later I woke up very early in the morning and I see her head leaning on my shoulder and her holding my hand and I pretty much melted. I mean what else can you expect. Nobody at the time warned me that what was happening was just not normal. And then one day we wake up and we're drinking coffee and she says to me that during the night she got woken up by me hugging her. Ps me hugging her was not intentional since at that time I didn't want anyone to know that I was I love with her but I mean that shit was obvious from like 10 miles away whether I wanted it or not. Couple of months pass and nothing of note happened. At this point I believe I could be 15 and she is 18 for sure. Then one night A went out on a party and I was sick so I stayed home and it was just my step mom and I and her kids and she comes up to me and tells me that she thinks that A is in love with me and she asks me if it's possible that I'm in love with her too. I naturally said no way but as the conversation went on I admitted and it was mostly since I knew that you have to be blind not to see that. Then she told me that it's possible that she can speak to her and see if it's true but in a inconspicuous way so that she never knew about that conversation. Couple of weeks pass and I just kept asking and asking if she spoke with her about that and then around 7 in the morning I ask her in a message if she spoke with her (at this point I was at my mom's house) and she said that she has. Naturally I was very nervous and just could not wait to see what she said. She then told me that she spoke about that with A and she said that it's absolutely not that and that I should forget all about it and that she doesn't look at me that way and A told her that she looks at me as a brother and nothing more. That completely broke me apart and I also think that that moment determined the next 3-4 years of my life. I think I'll never forget that day. At that moment I started crying like someone was holding a gun to my head. Then I got my shit together and I went to school and that day I wasn't acting like myself at all. People left right and center were asking me what is wrong with me and I didn't say anything since at that time I was ashamed at myself for expecting anything. Couple of weeks pass and I didn't have any contact with anyone outside of school. That was because my mom didn't let me to go to my dad's house at all. That was my first sign of heavy depression but never actually diagnosed since neither my mom nor my dad believed in depression and their motto was to just get over it. But I also can't blame that on them since they grew up in just awful conditions so I can see where they were coming from. During those couple of weeks I learned how to cope with all the negativity and sadness that I was up to my throat in. I could not find the way to be happy again so in those couple of weeks my school grades and behavior started to fall apart and I played a lot of video games and watched a lot of movies. The one particular movie that I watched is Straight Outta Compton. I heard some songs from the rap group NWA but never cared about them or rap in general until I watched one scene from that movie. For anyone that does not know that scene it was a scene where the group played Fuck the police on a concert after they were told that they are not allowed to play that song. Nevertheless they played it and the way that scene was shot and just with the emotion the actors were reciting words from that song made me inspired and motivated to say fuck everyone and everything and to just simply put the responsibility and choices of my life on everyone and nothing on me. At that point I started to get heavy into rap (mainly love songs eg. love the way you lie from Eminem etc etc.) and some motivational rap songs here and there. So some time passes and I wanted to see A and I asked if I could go to my dad's house to stay there for a bit and she surprisingly said yes and also that day I called in sick in school since I didn't hear the alarm and I woke up too late. So then in the morning around 9-10 pm I went to my step mom and stayed there for quite some time (weeks not hours or days) (yeah I know I was a idiot that didn't care about anything other than A). I remember coming to the house and after couple of hours A asks me if I want to go the the store with her to talk to her about something. I was scared shitless if she found out about that conversation. And it turned out it was not about that it was about her asking me what is wrong with me and why have I been lowkey pushing her away ever since I came there. I of course lied and just avoided that topic completely and I was just playing ignorant. Even though at the time I felt better since I was with her again. But at the time I did have some dislike at her because in my head at the time was that it's her fault that I was the way felt the way I have. Anyway we come home and for some time nothing big happened. So one day I remember sitting on the couch being on my phone and A tells me that she needs to asks me something but she can't ask me face to face for some reason. And I tell her I'll go on a computer and we we can talk over Facebook (yeah I know I was weirded out too). And she sends me a text and asks me if I'm love with her. I naturally said I wasn't and that I don't know where did she get that idea from. And when I came back into the living room she all of the sudden hugged me. Words cannot explain how confused I was at that moment in a sense of like what am I supposed to thing now. On the one hand she multiple times said that she's not I love with me but on the other hand why did she hug me for no particular reason. Then the next month or so became very very weird. So then one day or night in particular we were bored so she asked me if I was willing to go take a walk with her I (of course) said yeah and when we came outside she began acting like a literal kid. There was a small bench next to a tennis court that was about 3 minutes away and then all of the sudden she says let's race to that bench and as we came there we sat and we were talking and since i had a jacket and she didn't she said she was cold and I asked her if she wants my jacket and then she sat in my lap and i asked her something in a sense what are you doing she said that she would warm up that way and we kept on talking and a minute later she asked me in joking sense are you horny right now lol. Keep in the fucking mind she was 18 and I was 15. And a minute later we went back home and that was it. Some time later (I cant remember how long, but I'm sure it was days or weeks) we were packing up to go in the bed and we layed down and we were talking normally and then I saw that she was acting a bit strange so I asked her what's up since she was not acting sad or anything just different from usual and she tells me that she has to say something to me and I said to her to say if she wants to. Keep in mind that all the time lately that she physically was a bit too close to me (more than usual). And she said that a lot of the time lately she has felt the need to kiss and I asked her how so and she said that she doesn't know why she just felt like that and then she asked me if I was in love with her again I said that I was not and she just laughed it off and said for me to be honest to her. I felt like I was put in a corner and that there is no point more running and not saying that I'm love with her so I said that yes I was and I just told her everything. Unfortunately I cant remember what happened after that since it was it feels like a century ago but its one of those moments that just got engraved in my head. And again some time passes and I don't know how long but it cant be longer than month or so. She was in a way just kind of down that day. She had a situation where she was between two people and she couldn't know who to chose. I mean in a relationship's sense. So late at in the night we were sitting and drinking a beer and as we stood up to go and do something or go somewhere cant remember what exactly and she says she's so lucky to have me and almost kisses me. She put her hand on my face and just looked at me for a solid 20-30 seconds or so and I genuinely thought that she was going to kiss me but then she let go. Again can't remember what happened after that exactly. And as all of that is happening situation with my mom is going to shit more and more and it came so far that my step mom agreed to legally sue my mum (which I agreed to) for using drugs in a minor's presence and not being able to raise a child in that environment (at this point it may seem like my mom was a victim in all of this but trust me she was just not normal at the time, regularly I would find drugs in the bathroom, to her trying to punch me to constant everyday fighting with my step dad and me to us literally now having money to buy food to breaking stuff all the time to straight for a week not being able to do anything because of her not having the money for drugs etc etc.). So in the mean time I was so stressed (the thing with A getting worse over time, my mental state being awful and not knowing if I'm going to have to go back and live with my mum)about everything that I began just attacking everyone who even said anything I didn't like to hear. So at this point A is starting to dislike me more and more because of how I'm acting (understandable) and me feeling like a biggest piece of shit in the world and me just not wanting to go back to my mum's place since it's a disaster there. So me and my step mom agreed to go to the social center (don't know how to call it in English) for to to try to get custody of me. The day we went there to see what can be done is literally the worst day of my life. When we came there the social worker told us that nothing can be done unless my dad comes. When we came out of there after being told that I literally had a mental breakdown. When me and my step mom came home A just kept ignoring me (trust me she was really petty). And for the next hour or so I just sat in silence and listened to music. Then A and my step mom told me they were going to her family and before they left my step mom told me to trust her that everything's going to be alright and when they left i sat and i must've cried like a baby for a good 30 minutes or so and when I got up do go to the toilet to wash my face i hit the wall so hard that my fist began bleeding hard and to this day I still have the scar of that on my right fist. Later when they came back after a couple of hours or so they said that they have a idea to go to the police to see what can be done and when they did they said the same thing that the social worker said. That nothing can be done currently. I just felt like that was it, like there was no point more living. I was just sick of everything. I took my phone and turned it off completely so that no one can reach me. I went out at around 4 pm and I must've walked through the entire city just thinking about everything and when I was walking next to a small train station I remember seriously thinking about just jumping in front of a train to end it all. Thank shit I was just thinking about that and that I didn't really do it. So when I came home (to my stepmom's place) I turned on my phone and I was shocked. Everyone from my dad that was in Germany at that time to everyone from my mom's side of the family to my aunt that was working in Switzerland tried contacting me in any way possible. Numerus missed calls and messages. Some were comforting me, some were being angry at me for not answering. Quite literally the worst day of my life. So that night I had to go back to my mum and when I came back that's when the real depression hit me. I was sick of being with my mum, I haven't talked to A in quite some time and then what followed was the most awful couple weeks that can come. I remember after all that just being as miserable as a person can get. Eating all the time like I was going to die tomorrow, spending the entire days (it was summer time) either laying in my bed listening to music or going on long walks late at night, either sleeping the entire day or just not sleeping at all but then after a while I get a message from A asking me if I would like to meet up in secret so that my mom doesn't find out. I gladly agreed since I still loved her to hell and back. Like I mean she was still most of the reason why I was so depressed. Cut short to us walking to a coffee and I told her everything about how I've been lately and I felt like she was just disconnected the entire time. I didn't want to ask her anything about that since I haven't talked to her in so long and I didn't want to fuck that up. Then some time ahead I didn't see A for quite some time and I'm at the end of last class of primary school and I had a lot of grades to correct for me to pass the class so I had to study day in day out. At this point I'm better mentally but still A is on my mind always and I still could not stop thinking about all the better times we had with. I missed her a lot. Cut some time ahead I'm still not done with the primary school and again I went to my dads house for some time since the situation has relaxed. And when I get there A is never at home. She was always somewhere out and in like a month or so that I'm there I must've seen her like two times when she came back just to take something and then one day my step mom told me that she is moving out and going to live with her mom. Which didn't shock me but it still hurt like hell. So then again some time passes and its like the last month of the primary school and at this point I'm quite a lot better. I mean I'm still not the same person I was before but I was getting there. Then one day I went to my dad's house to take something for my pc from the basement and A was there. I pretty much froze in place and yeah we pretty much talked in general how I've been doing and how she was doing etc etc. Then when I went home somewhere around 11 pm and she said that we can go together since were going the same way. Then as we talked I mentioned that id kill for some ice cream now and she said that she has ice cream at her place (she wasn't living with her mom anymore, she was living now in the flat of her boyfriend that she was now dating, he was working in Germany at the time) and we went there and I stayed there up until 3 am and that was the last time we ever talked and seen each other. Stuff happened non relevant to this post, time went by and at this point I'm officially living with my step mom. For a year or so I've been living in that house and during all that time I again fell into a complete depression since over there. Day in day out I was always looking at things that reminded me of her eg. the couch we slept on, the rooms in general, the backyard in which we've spent time together and that was slowly opening the wound again and with couple of months that I've been living there I've been a disaster again, by that point I was going to the middle school and over there I was a disaster eg. not sleeping for 2 days straight and not showering for a good couple of days and going like that in school, eating a lot again, starting smoking cigarettes but by the time I've moved to Germany I've stopped smoking, constantly fighting with everyone in the house etc. At that point with my mental behavior I've lost all friends I've had, hating myself, etc etc the story you've heard million times and then some. And all of that just because I've been losing my mind by constantly being reminded of her by that fucking house. And I've been living like that for a good year and a half until me, my step mom and my step brothers moved with my dad in Germany. We have been living here for about two and a half years now and I think that that us moving here has saved my life and made me a normal functioning member of this society. At first when I was here I was bad as well here but when I have realized that I escaped that past life and that I'm only being irrational by acting like that and that I'm wasting a literally life changing opportunity just to dwell on the past. And while yes I'm in a 90% better state since and improved as a person by a a lot there are still two things still bothering me and those two things are the entire reason I'm writing this fucking book. That is that I have female friend and a lot of them are very attractive and good looking I still cant I guess fall in love with anyone. Like I mean no matter how much time is spend with them it just cant do it. I mean I'm about to turn 18 now and I still haven't fallen in love with anyone other than A nor been in a actual normal relationship with someone my age and I'm just worried I don't stay that way my entire life. I don't know like in the terms of dating etc. I'm afraid I'm scarred for life. I've had at least two good and respectable female friends with which I could've ended up in a relationship if I pushed just a bit but no I'm just no able to fall in love with anyone. That's what I meant when I said that I 100% loved her. It's because I just feel like can't fall in love with anyone anymore. What I want is just some closure, just a talk now that I'm not a child anymore so that this time we can talk like a person to a person. Like I don't care about hearing from her or talking to her every day and none of those things just talk to her. What I fear is that she still has a opinion about me being a child that was desperate for love. That is not who I am anymore. As I've said already currently the thing is that I just need closure to be able to 100% move on and that's the thing I have not been able to do. And the other thing was that all of this that I've wrote I've kept to myself and I cant talk about it with anyone since I don't want anyone to know of my old life here. I cant talk about it with my parents since in their eyes its going to be like I'm just complaining. So I just wanted to put this out there, somewhere since maybe that can help me to just forget it like it never happened. Just so that all of this is not just kept within me. Aaand now that I've written all of this I want to apologize for this being so long and I have also not gone in detail of everything. That all was just the big things that are in my head that I just cant shake off 100%.

So thanks for coming to my TED talk I guess haha and if anyone has made it this far good job give yourself a pat on the back you deserve it lol

(Not in my office, I love the people I work with) The only feedback is “attitude” but when I ask for examples nobody says anything or has any, which is just frustrating because I have RBF. I don’t know if it’s “senioritis” or what, I’m not trying to burn bridges or anything either. I also have lately had 0 motivation to do anything, I feel absolutely exhausted for no reason. Normally I go to the gym every day, I’m motivated and I’m quite fit but the past week or so I’ve been having to convince myself to go and I feel like my workouts are subpar. I also just feel like I’m withdrawing from people, making excuses not to go out sometimes, but then making myself go and sometimes just regretting it and then I feel guilty! Idk what my problem is, I’m not trying to make excuses, this is not my character and I don’t know what to do. Thanks, sorry for sounding like an asshole.",13Oct2020,1
226,"Last night, my older sister and I were in deep conversation. She’s always been emotionally distant from everyone. We developed a close bond earlier on in life so she’s pretty much able to talk to me. Her dad wasn’t very much in her life and the only father figure she had was mine. 

Rewind a few years ago. We moved to go live with our step dad. He was a pedo and my dad suspected it. My dad would always ask if he touched us. He had never. I had never heard my sister cry the way she did when she realized she was the object of my step dads sick attraction. My dad always talked about how sick it was.

My sister wanted me to tell no one what she told me. But I’m already in such a bad place with my mental health that it is eating me alive. But I know her secret was eating her too. And I’m happier about that. I know why she is the way she is. She never told anyone what happened with her because she didn’t want me and my sister to grow up without a father. And she was hesitant about telling me that day because she knew I might see my father differently. Which I do. 

I feel awful. All of this feels so surreal. Part of me hates my dad for doing what he did to her. Part of me thinks she’s lying. Which I know she wouldn’t do. I know it can’t be a lie because everything makes so much sense. She cried telling me. I don’t want to go back to his house. He can’t go to jail either. This happened before my parents break up. It would just be my manipulative dad’s word against hers.

I know I shouldn’t have known this. If it’s never told I guess I’ll be fine but I’ll always see my dad as a disgusting man. If my mom finds out, there will be more division. My little sister won’t believe my older sister, driving a wedge between their already paper thin relationship. I won’t be able to see my dad but he will still be free. If it’s ever suspected that my sister is lying, my dad will hate me and be angry with me all the time. 

I feel sympathy towards him. He’s my dad, of course. I know he has to feel some sort of guilt for what he did. The thing that he’s hoping won’t come back to bite him. My sister told me that he tried to tell her there was nothing wrong with what he was doing.

My life is so fucked up right now and it feels horrible. It’s all so new to me. And I don’t like it. It feels like my life is coming to a turning point. 

tl;dr My sister told me what my dad did to her and now I can’t talk to my dad without a strong feeling of disgust.",13Oct2020,1
227,"Good evening everyone! How are well all doing? 

For today’s post, I will be explaining to you how Mental Health is being dealt with in my country. Before I begin, many of you don’t know which country I am specifically talking about. Well, the country I’m talking about is Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿, which is located in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧. Now that’s out of the way, here’s how it’s being treated here:

Firstly, in Wales, we have our very own Mental Health wellbeing strategy for the country. In 2012, The Welsh Government created a brand new Mental Health strategy with the saying “**Together For Mental Health**. Also, The Welsh Government has set out the “**vision for 21** century Mental Health services. 

So, the big questions is what does the Welsh Government provide? What are they doing? The aim is to promote Mental wellbeing and to prevent as much Mental Health problems in the future. To add, they are also aiming to improve Mental Health services. Lastly, The Welsh Government continues to aim towards intervening early when people are diagnosed with illnesses, such as psychiatric and to also reduce the impact of serious Mental Health illness. The strategy that the Welsh Government provides is for all ages, including children, adults and older people. The Mental Health services will continue to provide to all 3 age range groups, but that being said, the strategy wants to improve the transitions for people who move between these services. 

**Together For Mental Health - The Strategy**

Back in 2012, The First Minister, Carwyn Jones launched this programme. Here are some quotes from him, regarding the launch of this strategy:

- *I made a clear statement that creating the Wales of the future is something that involves all of us. What this means is that no matter in which field or area we work, be it health, education, housing, the economy, or elsewhere, our actions are all intertwined. The decisions we take in one area can have a positive or negative effect in others, the impact of which can far outlast the original decision. That is why this Welsh Government has made sustainable development
our central organising principle, a desire to improve social, economic and environmental wellbeing to the benefit of the people and communities of Wales*. 
- *Together for Mental Health exemplifies this approach. It sends a clear message that the delivery of the improvements in mental health and wellbeing we want to see can only be achieved by concerted effort and commitment on behalf of all Welsh Government departments and our partners. This
is why, on behalf of my Cabinet colleagues, I am pleased to commit the Welsh Government to delivering this Strategy*. 
- *Developing good mental health and resilience in individuals is about developing a more socially just Wales. Welsh Ministers have committed to place this Strategy at the heart of policy development and we expect all of those who work with us to do likewise*. 
- *Welsh Ministers are embracing their responsibilities to deliver improvements in mental health and wellbeing across their departments and portfolios. This may be by improving mental health awareness in the workplace, recognising the impact of child poverty or acknowledging the importance of sports
and culture, not just to our national identity but also to our individual and collective emotional wellbeing. Put simply, we all have a role and responsibility to deliver the objectives and outcomes arising from this Strategy. Equally, we all stand to benefit from its success, be that in a healthier population and workforce, which will help drive the economic regeneration we wish to see in our economy, or in stronger, more cohesive communities*.

That is not the only service that is provided in Wales. Secondly, **Mind**, a Mental Health charity. Their slogan goes “We won’t give up until everyone experiencing a Mental Health problems gets support and respect”. So, what do they provide exactly? **Mind** provides as much support and device as possible for anyone that’s experiencing a Mental Health problem. Mind campaigns to improve a range of different things, such as:

- The services
- To Raise More Awareness
- Promoting Understanding   

Throughout the whole of Wales, **Mind** has 20 local services in the country, from the North to the South.

Thirdly... **Hafal**, a Mental Health charity that supports people with Mental Health problems. They also help and provides support for people who are currently experiencing a range of disabilities. Hafal covers every corner of Wales in which their services are underpinned by a very unique recovery programme. Hafal has a BUNCH of different Mental Health campaigns, which are:

- Jo’s Blog

228,"Guilty of completely forgetting about my friends. Its such a horrible thing about me. I completely forget that a person exist. I don’t seem to recall about a certain person for so many days until one day randomly I come across there name. 
That reminds of the relation I have with said person. And I feel so guilty and utterly horrible from the inside. 
I feel so bad for forgetting such an important person in my life. For not being able to remember moments to completely forgetting about their existence. 
And every time I am reminded all I want to do is go and hug the person and apologise for the stupid forgetting self that I am.

Ive been diagnosed with depression and general anxiety. I have a few OCD-like things so I think I should talk to someone about that... but is this part of OCD? or something else? I feel like Im crazy.

I get really upset about the some really really weird things and it makes no sense even to me but I cant control it. I think for a while, starting since I was pretty young (I dont have a good memory of my childhood at all but maybe 3-6?). I used to be rlly sensitive to this one clanking noise of making tea and stirring the spoon. I dont think it hurt but it really annoyed me. But I grew out of that and it started to get weirder. It would switch between random stuff... an aversion to a certain word, people doing a certain thing. I used to really hate when people would make certain expressions with their mouths... I think I was paranoid that I would look like that if I witnessed them making weird faces? Onto the next topic... ive always been picky about what dishes I use. Im not sure what the rules are honestly, and if I absolutely have to eat off of other dishes I will, but I have specific dishes and cups that I 'can use.' Some im 'meh' about, and some I hate. Like, I cant have them next to mine or Ill get anxious. I feel crazy for it and Idk whats wrong with me... any advice???",13Oct2020,1

233,"I am at an age now where the people I went to school with are getting their first home or having children . Every time I go on social media I see a picture of someone I went to school with celebrating their graduation or welcoming a baby . I am thrilled for them , I really am . But it makes me look at my life and think “what a piece  of shit you are , you live with your grandparents and you didn’t even finish university. You are the scum of the earth ,you freak.”no offence to anyone who is in that situation , we all have our own problems and situations, but my brain constantly tears me apart.I feel like I disappointed my family because they deserve a much better child than me . I want to make them proud . Like if someone comes to their house and there is a picture of me in university graduation attire they can say “THAT is MY grandchild” with a smile . Now I am just a dosser and I’m ashamed that they have to associate in any way with me . 

I was so close to graduating in medicine and I lost it all because of my cystic fibrosis and declining mental health . I look back on my life and think “what could I have achieved if I had just hung on a-bit longer in education “ . I see my class mates living life and it makes me depressed that I am a nothing and no body . I’ve never been to a club , I’ve never smoked , I’ve never learned to drive . All things people my age can do with ease and I feel like such a letdown and disappointed . You are probably thinking , well just do the things you want then and stop whining about it . I feel stuck in a vicious cycle of my physical health being very bad , so that makes my mental health bad , meaning I can’t do stuff . Even the common cold can put me in hospital for weeks and I’m constantly treading on eggshells.

I had such plans for life I had an apprenticeship at my local hospital. I had an interview for Oxford . And I lost it all , mental and physical problems ruined my life and I am so ashamed becuse I feel like such a leech .I feel like I’m an oxygen thief . Does this happen to anyone else .

234,"Less than a week ago my SO came out with a secret that he’s been told onto for 3 years.... he cheated on me with a former coworker who was in an open marriage. She gave him oral, in his car, in our garage, and I only found out that last detail because I pressed him. We’ve been married for 10 years, and honestly.... I don’t know where to go from here. She may have been in an opened marriage but we never were. 

We had our first couples counseling appointment last night, and honestly I don’t know if it’s going to do anything. I’m not sure what I want- I just feel so angry, and so disappointed. I told him, I don’t want to know her name. If I knew that I couldn’t be responsible for what I might do....

235,"If I'm being completely honest, I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm just going through the motions of what 9th grade me set up for myself. International Relations and Global Affairs--the classes actually related to my assumed Global Affairs degree--are the two classes I have not really enjoyed. And it's not just that, it's everything about college. I don't really want a job in the global affairs field, so what am I doing? I've been worrying about this since college application season last year, but I'm so worried that I'm wasting this much money. 

At the same time, the thought of not graduating in spring of 2024 devastates me. I've always had this image of what adult life is ""supposed"" to be like, but the more I think about it, the more I worry that is going to be impossible for me. I've always imagined myself being in DC or Tokyo or Yerevan, but I don't think I can even handle another semester being away from home. I should be able to enjoy my time being away from home at college like everyone else, right? I always imagined myself being a diplomat, but that kind of social interaction is just exhausting. I don't think there was a single Model UN conference I was not crying on the way home because I was so drained even though I always had fun. And they were always only just a day or two long.

I guess the point is I have no idea what to do. All options seem terrible. Everyone in the family always seems so proud of me that I'm ""doing so well,"" and I don't want to disappoint everyone. And I don't want to disappoint myself either. I know I probably need to go back to therapy, but idea of having $250 therapy sessions every week makes me feel terrible too.

I called at my appointment time and got reamed out because I wasn't there. I also had tried calling and leaving a message, but her mailbox was full. I could have called the main number and asked for her or left a message, but I also am juggling 4 kids with schoolwork five days a week, Partial Hospitalization Program twice a week, Drug and Alcohol class once a week (supposed to be discharged but the lady is never in the office to do the paperwork with me), keeping up on housework and trying not to go insane with all of this. It simply did not dawn on me. Actually something good came out of all that though...my PO switched me from Tuesday morning appointments to Wednesday late morning appointments (I will just leave from Partial, walk the block and a half to the Probation Office, have a 15 minute sit down with my PO and then walk back to Partial) which is MUCH more convenient since I will be downtown already. Then at Drug and Alcohol, I was given an appointment to see the lady who has to discharge me on Friday afternoon! I hope she is there. She got called for Jury Duty for today, and if she doesn't get picked then she can do the discharge on Friday. If she does get picked, we will have to make some other arrangements. I did my urine screen today (mandatory for discharge) too. :D I just got called for Colors not even a week ago, so I know I am clean. I don't drink or use drugs at all (except Lexapro which is prescribed).

Our daughter (the one in college) wants me to come up to NY to sit in on her filming next week. She is doing her Capstone Project (Senior Project) for graduation and she wants myself and her little sister to be there while she is filming. Well, my PO isn't too happy with me right now...so I was afraid to ask. I was very upset because I really want to go up and see her (it would be for one or two nights) but I am afraid to even ask...UGH. There will be other opportunities to see her work though next semester and by then, all should be well again. I just can't miss any more appointments with PO. Heh. The other people at Drug and Alcohol cheered me up though (they are fantastically empathetic!!!) and that is when my day started to get better. Hubby picked me up and we went to pay our Internet/Phone/TV bill, then went to the store. I got to be alone with hubby for a long time this afternoon and it was SO nice. He was cheering me up too. He was in an oddly silly mood and had me laughing with some of the stuff he was saying. :) We came home and had home-made ""Whoppers"" and fries with gravy and now I am laying on my bed playing Angry Birds 2 on my phone while watching ""Pyromanen"" on my tablet here (it is on pause so I can write this) and drinking ice water. I feel content and pretty danged happy. Our 16 year old was making his 10 year old brother laugh and it was just music to my ears. It made me smile. I also had a good exchange with the neighbor upstairs (gave her some mail that was put in our box by mistake and she gave us some that was put in HERS by mistake lol).   


Also, our 10 year old is all caught up on his online schoolwork! :D Yeahhhhhhh for learning about Christopher Columbus and how to do Parentheses and Bracket Word Problems (Math). Whooooo. Fascinating stuff. Can you feel the sarcasm on that one? Definite /s haha! That is all for now. Sorry it is so damn long...I am tired but happily tired this time.

245,"So a little backstory, I've known said person for all my life. And in the past, they were very calm, never had thoughts that derailed/had any sort of indication they had ADHD. Talked in a normal pace. However, after they moved, they began to talk really really fast (almost comically), fakes their personality (a whole different issue), self-diagnosed themselves for the past few years after acting like this, and surrounded themselves with people who would believe them.  
Recently, said person has met with therapists and psychologists. They jumped from therapist to therapist until someone who believed them/agreed with their self-diagnosis came along. At this point, she is so deep into her faking that she convinced her therapist, psychologist, and psychiatrist that she has ADHD (among other disorders). I'm not saying she doesn't have anything, as I'm sure from what I've seen she does have some mental disorders. I do as well (properly diagnosed). But she seems to have exaggerated everything for the past few years, even managing to get adderall from a doctor who doesnt speak english well (so it was easy for her to get). I'm worried about this, as she's now getting medication for something she doesn't have and never seemed to have.  
What bothers me is that I'm diagnosed with similar things, and she discredits it because I don't ""act like it"" (ironic), and is dead set that my psychiatrist has misdiagnosed me. However, even if this is true, she has been self diagnosing herself for years, convincing herself and others she has ADHD and ""fixing"" her personality to be like the stereotypical misconceptions of ADHD. I'm not very educated on what ADHD is in the first place, but what she's doing is so ridiculous to me that I'm pretty sure she doesn't actually have ADHD. Am I crazy here? I'd love some input, and I'm sorry if this is wrong for this sub.",13Oct2020,1
246,"I looked up MPD and it's definitely not that, I have no amnesia or anything and I recognize that both of these personalities are me. I don't think it's just the occurrence of switching your personality in depending on the setting(like public vs. private). I feel like they are way too different to be that, I even have completely opposite political opinions at the same time. One side is conservative and one side is leftist. Deep down, I wholeheartedly believe in each one of them while also seeing that both of my opinions are flawed. My conservative side(C) is much more brash, loud and selfish but life is a lot more fun when I am C. My other side(L) is much more quiet, kind and empathic but L can get boring and I'm usually very anxious as L.

I thought that maybe I had ASPD because when I meet someone, I listen and analyze them, then choose which personality they would like best for me to use. It's not out of malice or manipulation though, it's to earn their approval. Although I'm overall more on the selfish side, I feel guilty taking advantage of people so I don't act on it. 

Also, it extends past social interaction. When I'm alone to only my own thoughts, I sometimes have arguments in my head between C and L, usually about politics. It ends after not too long because I get very mentally exhausted. They always end in stalemates. They are both me, but they are not the same.

I went through a pretty big identity crisis last year so maybe I still haven't fully recovered. But if that's the case, which one is me? I don't like one more than the other, they both have some pretty great qualities as well as bad flaws and they're so different I feel like it's impossible to combine them.

I'm very confused what is going on and I want to know if this experience isn't unique or if there is some label for this. Any help is appreciated.",13Oct2020,1

249,"I was diagnosed with ADHD (or ADD to be more specific, but I believe they’re now considered the same thing) at a young age. Never have been able to get things done. I’m not particularly forgetful about tasks, it’s more like I’m so aware of and overwhelmed by everything I know I need to finish that I just shut down. Intermittently medicated (Concerta, then Adderall), currently not.

I started therapy in my senior year of high school because of suicidal ideation, and was then diagnosed with Severe Adjustment Disorder with anxiety and depressive tendencies, but rather than try to fix all that, it seemed like my therapist, like my school guidance counselor, was much more focused with managing my ADHD and getting me into college. It was always, “Oh, just make a list” or “Oh, just do things as soon as you think of them,” but never addressing the fact that so much as thinking about things I need to do sends me spiraling into stagnancy.

I left for another state to study music and dropped out after 2 semesters of binge drinking and not going to class. About a year after I came home I had an incident with my best friend and my girlfriend that led me to come to terms with the fact that I am an alcoholic, in that, historically, when I start drinking, I don’t really stop until I’m blacked out and I make a fool of myself, or until I wake up in the hospital with no clue where I am or how I got there. I decided to go back to therapy to get on top of it, but still found that my therapist was much more intent on my keeping a calendar than my literal drinking problem. Haven’t been back since. Didn’t fix the drinking problem, though I did keep it in check for over a year. But my girlfriend of almost 3 years broke up with me after a blacked-out bout with my family less than a month ago.

I’ve since moved out of my girlfriend’s house and back home with my family, which is miserable. But my latest development is that I’m finding more and more that I don’t know what’s objectively real and not real. Like, I THINK I’m typing an arduous reddit post about my mental health, but I don’t know if that’s what I’m actually doing, if reddit is a real website, or if I even exist. I feel much more like a malfunctioning robot with a broken processor than a human being. I prayed to god today (I’m not even religious) to just take away my self-awareness and make me like an animal so I wouldn’t have to feel this way anymore. It’s like my brain has a trillion tabs open at once, but rather than clicking on each one to see it, they’re all open simultaneously, with all the thoughts, emotions, and information I have in me swirling and amalgamating into a twisted nightmare version of what my world used to be. I want to turn it off. I feel like a foreign entity observing the world through the eyes of a person I used to be, and it’s really freaking me out.

252,"I'm not going to ask if this is normal because I know it isn't, but I've been wondering if I should go see a therapist or a psychiatrist for a while now.

I'm in my early 20's and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I've always had social anxiety, but lately it's gotten worse and it's not just social.

I'm always stressed about every little detail. It takes me forever to fall asleep because I have to recite this mental mantra that goes something like ""I won't do anything bad while I'm asleep, I'm not going to hurt anyone"" and I have to say it an uneven number of times, but sometimes it doesn't satisfy me and I have to do it all over but the phrases have to change every time. Then I have to look out the window, close my eyes and put my belly towards the wall, otherwise I get all jittery. If I do anything wrong, I have to start over. 

When I know I'm going to spend the night with my girlfriend I can't relax because I'm afraid that I'll hurt her in my sleep, it's all I think all day long. Sometimes I've tried sleeping in the bathroom with the door locked and the key hidden so I wouldn't have the chance to do anything.

I'm extremely socially anxious because I feel like I could just snap any moment and make a fool of myself. I have to restrain myself from doing insane stuff all the time; for example, say I'm talking to an old person, I have to concentrate really hard on not pushing them. If I'm talking to a friend, I have to focus on not touching their butt. If I'm standing at the station, I have to focus on not peeing myself even though I don't have to pee. All this concentrating results in me not being able to form coherent sentences or listen to what people say.

As I've stated in my last post, I have no friends. I don't do internet servers and I definitely don't trust people. To whoever reads this I'm sorry lmao. I stress out easily and when I'm alone it makes me feel like I'm physically repulsive. Yesterday was a bit of a doosy for me. 

Not sure exactly what caused it but right in the middle of dinner I came close to a panic attack. I felt like I was gonna puke and I just wanted a quiet evening. Was playing minecraft with my SO and they started talking about cooking. I kinda enjoy cooking so I thought it would be a good topic to focus on. 

I brought up the fact that I use a rice cooker to cook normal rice dishes and they start going on about how lazy I am using a rice cooker. Okay ouch but it's all cool I guess I am kinda lazy. Then they start attacking me with instant damage arrows. (For the people who don't play mc they can kill you but shields can block them). At this point I'm kinda getting pestered but it's okay cuz it's just a game. Then they start attacking me with their sword. I take a few swings back but at this point I'm trying to tell them to stop. 

And they wouldn't. Like this went on for 5 minutes before I just go silent then they start saying that I'm mad over and over while circling me. I wasn't mad I just wanted to cry. 

At this point I don't remember if I got off call to do something or just stay silent but I remember thinking to myself if I don't step back now I'm gonna break down. 

But the worst part about it is I lied to myself saying I was being overly sensitive. I mean I wasn't trying to but I almost had a panic attack and that would leave anyone sensitive. I'm not sure if anyone was to blame cuz there really wasn't any turmoil afterwards.
