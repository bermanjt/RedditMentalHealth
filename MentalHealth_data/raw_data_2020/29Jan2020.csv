1,"Hey, just wanted to vent out a bit, maybe seek a few words of kindness along the way, especially if there is anyone out there feeling as i am 

Right now I'm in the prime of my life, and depending on my effort my life could turn out many ways, im at the age when real life responsibility is starting to weigh in, i have to work, pay bills, but i also have all these dreams i am constantly working to accomplish, in 5 months ill take an exam that will effective immediate achieve my biggest life goal right off the bat, but this requires an amount of study and effort that i dont even know if im capable of, as well as a monetary investment that (won't cripple me cause im not in usa) but still would be a big blow if i don't achieve, now as for the title of this post, At times i feel so empowered, i feel drive and resolve, but at random i can feel myself just slip away and ask myself if this is even worth it, after laying in bed a while i get the resolve back and realize its all an adventure and if things don't work out then i have nothing to worry, i can always try again next year, but then again get a tremendous hit of sadness and dare i say, depression, i have had mild chronic depression, not medically diagnosed, i dont have the magnitude of negative thoughts now that i had back then, but anyway, my life is good, im a happy guy, i just have many things bringing me down lately

 

Slightly more detail: 

Im an 18 yo Mexico/American, just finished high school on July, took a year off before university to work, i was able to go to usa to work for a few months and bought my first car back home, ive got a loving gf with an incredibly understanding and supportive relationship, now for the negatives, i haven't been able to find a job here in Mexico and im running out of the money i made back in usa, ive been able to make some money here and there and selling some stuff, but no stable job, almost had one as a math tutor but it unexpectedly shut down after my 2nd day there, tried giving personal classes on my own, havent been able to get any students yet, im trying to learn WordPress to work with my mother on some projects she and her boss could pay me very well for, but it isnt yet approved, ontop of everything ive written id have to also sacrifice and apply effort into this, not fully knowing if it will work out. 

The worse part about studying for the exam is that i have no teachers or mentors, there is no online guidance of any kind, just ask some old teachers to nudge me in the correct direction telling me what books i should study from, which ive already bought and am using, i feel so lost in them, math comes somewhat easy to me altho when i get my ""sadness"" episodes i sure as hell dont feel confident, as for physics, i dont even know if im going the right way, i cant identify if im learning, i still haven't started studying for the biology and chemistry portions, all the above at university level, as for this exam, it is an international scholarship for a full paid study college study to japan, which takes me to, some sources say you dont need to previously know Japanese to get this scholarship because they will provide you with a full year of Japanese language living in japan before starting college, and other sources say i do require some basic level, again, taking into account everything i have to study and work and do, this is something i have to think very carefully to invest in, but it also feeds into my fear and sadness of if this is even worth it, because if i dont learn Japanese and this rule is actually true, then even having the highest score on the rest of the exams it would all have been for nothing, then again that is an assumption that i could even be the best taking into account i dont know the first thing about chemistry or biology as of rn... 

As for my life goal at the moment, its to get out of Mexico, i really dont have a problem with it, i just dont want to study college here, they dont have theoretical phisics where i am, but they do have physics engineering, which would be kind of settling for me, going to usa is out of the question because of the prices, on top of the fact i dont super love it there either, but yeah, studying physics engineering in mexico is my plan B

&amp;#x200B;

Ontop of this i have various hobbies, some of which make me a atleast some money and non of which id like to give up, im a doujin scanlator, musician and producer, i take singing classes and boxing and kickboxing, i could get good some day, i play the guitar, drums and piano and i play video games with my friends... and as you're probably telling yourself if you've read this far, holly shit bro calm down, and yeah, that how it be. Lastly i am a huge procrastinator, evidenced by the fact i tt took me about 30 minutes to write all this down and im supposed to be studying, anyway, have a good day, thanks for reading",29Jan2020,2
2,"I'm a junior in college and 20. I have always struggled with anxiety as a child and teenager and got diagnosed with social anxiety disorder at 18. I went to therapy, started on medication, and now no longer have social anxiety disorder. However, now I think I have more depressive symptoms and they are bothering me. 

So I have noticed that with any sort of change in my life that isn't positive I am susceptible to developing what I guess is situational depression. Last semester I went through a break-up and at the start of this semester I hadn't realized how much time I had spent with him in the previous semester. I have mostly gotten over the breakup/the guy but I miss having someone to hang out with all the time in that way. Also, I feel like although I have the same amount of friends I did last semester, it just isn't the same and we don't all hang out as a group much anymore. I don't like not having almost every minute of my day taken up with either class or hanging out with people and I get really lonely and down when I'm by myself.

I think these things have accumulated into me feeling lack of motivation and down.",29Jan2020,2
3,"We've taken him to a tharapist. He has been exhibiting odd behaviors for most of his life. Hes a rough and tumble boy who likes riding his bike, wrestling and play fighting with his best friend but some parents have told me he pushes boundaries. He likes to draw and talk about guts and fighting. 
He crys when he gets his feelings hurt and is soo sweet and sensitive some times. But he does and says weird shit out of nowhere. I chalk it up to him being a kid but have been taking him to therapy to talk about boundries and ""right and wrong""

My son ""luke"" has a best friend who's father (Joe) is close friends with my partner ""amiee"" and I. 
The boys were having a sleep over the other night and Joe, Aimee and I were having a few drinks.  Usually we put the boys to bed around 10 and Joe ""sleeps"" on the couch. Because we dont let people drive home after drinking. 

We live on a rancher and there is an unfinished room above the garage separate from the house. Luke has his Nintendo set up in there and he treats it like a club house. We set up bean bag chairs and sleeping bags so they could sleep there for the night. We tucked the boys in around 10 and went back to the main house to have a few more drinks and joke around. Luke came in around 10:30 to use the bathroom and we heard him leave through the front door again. 

Maybe around 1am Aimee, Joe and I went to the master bedroom. We made sure the bedroom door was locked.. we always did.  One thing lead to another and we had sex for a while. When we were done Joe put his clothes back on and went to go sleep out on the couch so the boys wouldn't walk in on anything. I went to get a glass of water and Aimee called me back to the room. Luke was standing in the room. She said ""he was in here.""
I asked him if he was spying on us and he nodded yes. I told him to go back to bed and we'd talk in the morning. As he walked out he said ""You're a slut!"" And slammed the front door. I didnt know what to do. I just let him go.

Sunday morning we made pancakes. Joe's son was giggly and joking with Luke.
We asked if Joe wanted any pancakes and Luke interjected ""Joe wants to starve to death""

Joe (who was filled in that he saw us) asked him ""Got anything you want to say Luke?"" And luke straight up replies ""Yea. How many times has my Mom sucked your dick?"" 
Joe's son asks ""What?"" And luke tried to tell him in as much detail as he can in front of everyone what he saw.  I had to physically cover his mouth to make him stop. Joes son was crying. We gave them the ""adults have private time together sometimes"" talk and that it was a huge violation that he spied to which he said ""I've watch Aimee suck your vagina a lot"" and ""she just sucked your vagina friday."" He also tried to get into detail about other ways he'd seen is have sex. But we had to tell at him to stop. He likes crossing boundries.

Aimee told me she couldn't be around and needed to leave and process. We haven't had a chance to talk yet and I fear my relationship may be over

Apparently sometimes he doesnt go to bed when hes told. He just hides under our bed where he can see everything from the mirrors on the closet doors. Joe asked him if he masturbates to it. He said ""Not to my mom. Shes a slut"" but he likes watching?? Hes fucking 10! Wtf

I'm beyond uncomfortable by this. When I was a child I was disgusted by anything my parents did I'm fucking disgusted by my child watching me. I feel like I've been holding it together pretty well. This week we've just run through the motions, school, work, soccer practice, dinner bed. I check hes in bed. We haven't talked about what happened since Sunday. I can barely look my kid in the eyes. How do I even begin to talk our therapist tomorrow with out going off? My partner doesnt want to talk about it with me. Joe just says hes a weird kid but hell get over it

Has anyone else, tharapist, person, anyone had this experience with their child.",29Jan2020,0

5,"Is anyone else on Naltrexone (50 mg) here? 

I just started to take it today and I am not sure what I felt was a side effect of the medication (it can't happen that fast--side effect first time taking it, can it?) or if it was caused by something unrelated (I haven't been sleeping too great and my anxiety is up). The one side effect that I had (I was sleepy all afternoon after I took it, so this is going to be another night medicine I think) was on the list of possible side effects on the internet so I'm not talking about that. I would like to hear what side effects y'all had before I tell what it was that I had experienced. Thanks in advance!!!",29Jan2020,1
6,"When I was i my late teens, I was very promiscuous. I had a type - white guys. I myself, am not white. I found white guys very attractive and I was insecure and they made me feel attractive (unlike men of my own race, who I felt overlooked me). I had a lot of sex. I was left feeling shameful and guilty about my actions and I hated myself for a long, long time. It's years on now and I'm in a relationship with a white guy and I love him dearly. I am attracted to him, of course, but it's his personality I love most of all and we are due to marry next year. We have had our ups and downs based on my past, but we go to Church together and have worked through it.

However, whenever I meet another white male (not even someone I find attractive) - I panic. I begin to feel sick and have a what I can only explain as an 'anxiety attack'. I avoid interaction with other white men at all costs (I am fine around my fiance and his friends and totally find around white women). If I don't avoid them, I end up feeling sick for days...My mind seems to convince me that I find them attractive (which I don't most of the time) and I am TERRIFIED that they will find me attractive. It only happens with white men.

I am wondering if anyone knows if this is anxiety? Is this a normal human response for someone who has experienced trauma? I'm a little scared...",29Jan2020,0

10,"I have been depressed and suicidal for I don't even know how many years and never sought help since I thought it was normal for a teen. It really started to hit hard this year and and started to have outburst in school and started to take drugs and alcohol. Yesterday morning I learned something bad about a project submission that made me have an outburst and I took some cannabis for relaxation and went to class. In class my friend after learning that I had consummed Cannabis got mad at me and I just yelled what do you want from me and ran out of the class and sat on a bench. The the psychoeducator talked with me and decided to take me to the emergency in Douglas Mental Institute. It's my first time in a mental institute. The doctor decided to keep me here because she doesn't want me to kill myself. They gave me some antidepressant to see how it works with my body this morning even thought they told me they would do that yesterday. I feel lost and abandoned. Between the few friends I have left, only one texted me once and I think he just did that out of guilt. Today a college from my part-time job called me. I didn't go to work yesterday and she saw that I'm here on my Snapchat(now I turned off my location on Snapchat ) she told me that she'll visit me tomorrow. My dad called me more than 10 times now but I don't have the courage to pick up the phone. I hate him, he never helped me throughout my life. He beat me when I cried. He asked me why am I the one being bullied among everyone else when my mom( who also beat me) told him that I was bullied. But I think I'll stop writing here since I think the text is long enough.

13,"How do I stop my body from shutting down getting sick from stress?

Last year I was really stressed after migrating and I’m 15 btw. So to keep it short I was stressed out and sick and I started balding, my temple hairs were just completely gone, but now after a while it’s coming back but with how my family is and I have no friends at school I can just feel the stress building up back after my long summer rest and taking time for my self in winter . 

My grades are good ,I’m trying very hard. My social life is very bad because I don’t like talking, since I’ve come to this new school I’ve just been quiet and kinda seen and known as that weird quiet kid. My hairline sucks and it really breaks my confidence. I just don’t want my body to shut down again and I put on weight. When i was at my old school I was kinda breaking out my shell because of the friends I made, I started going to volleyball practice, going outside more,etc. now I feel like a sad sack of garbage daily. 

People used to ask me “if I liked/wanted to play volleyball” when I was on the court and basically telling me I’m bad and I should quit.  So after that term I was gonna quit trying to make the team but just play to lose more weight and for fun. But... then I found out I was gonna move.

A few minutes after typed all this I forgot to send it and my dad came in my room being aggressive asking me where my books are and why am I not studying. Then my mom sends me to get something and I ask her which one she said don’t worry about it and said go to bed.

14,"hi I'm new and I'm not sure if this is the right sub reddit to post to. I'd appreciate any personal experiences or knowledge that helped. 

anyway, I'm here to ask what type of medication I should look into to help my problems.

I think I may have depression, but I don't experience much anxiety because I am very apathetic and aloof. I don't have much emotion, sad or happy, and I feel I am lacking motivation and incentive. I don't sleep very well nor do I wake up very well. everything in my life is fine, I just don't feel joy or sadness. 

obviously I'll be talking to and asking my doctor, but I'd like to hear what anybody else has to say. I'm leaning away from anti depressants as what I've heard about weight gain, and I'm leaning away from stimulants as they give me energy but they don't make me feel emotional or enjoy much. however, I will still take any advice or entry about any type of medication.

If any of you would be interested in helping me, I have created a survey that shouldn’t take longer than 5 minutes to complete. You do NOT need to have ADHD/ADD to take this survey, I encourage as many different people as possible to take it.

[Disclaimer:] The survey is completely anonymous, and I will have no way of tracing the answers to any individual person. Participants will also be asked to provide their age, biological sex, prefered gender, mental health/treatment history, take an 18 question ADHD assessment test, and a rejection sensitivity assessment test. As some of the questions can be emotionally triggering for some, any questions that cause emotional discomfort can be skipped, with the exception of your biological sex and if you have ADHD.

22,"I used to have pretty typical control of my emotions and used to have normal reactions to things. I've been through a lot of emotionally straining events in the last few years and I've not been coping very well. I'm starting to realise that my emotions are very dulled compared to how they used to be. My happy moments are less happy but also my sad moments aren't as sad.

For example a few days before Christmas my dad crashed and flew off his quad bike. He had 5 broken ribs, 2 perferated lungs, a lot of internal bleeding and his legs and arms were horribly scarred. My mum phoned me as soon as it happened and she was so panicked and flustered she hadn't even called for an ambulance yet.I was concerned and tried to talk her through it and try to understand what's going for myself and met dad  a couple of hours later at the hospital. I knew how I should have felt, namely relief that he wasn't dead but also fear, pity and love. I didn't feel any of this though, I didn't really feel anything. In fact all I did was make a joke about not wearing his helmet and then started scrolling through Reddit as if it was just any normal day.

Another example is my workfriends chipped in together to get me a set of high-end ear pods for my birthday. I knew that I should have felt grateful and I let everybody know that I was and thanked them all but that grateful ""feeling"" wasn't really there...It was more like a very short lived burst of happiness.

I'm a virgin and don't think I have a libido.  Anything I used to find interesting, I don't after 6-7 long years of major depression and suicidal ideation.  I've never had a relationship and have only felt a sense of belonging for a short moment when I was 12.

I have never had a job, and it brings such heavy anxiety.  I am aware of how pathetic it looks to be depressed, and all my impulses that feel to be out of respectful self-loathing are mainly just disguises to handle being insecure and defensive without feeling immense shame.  I don't know why, but I just can't do anything anymore.

I used to be smart at school, I used to read a lot, I used to do research by myself.  I got CFS/ exacerbated psychomotor &amp; cognitive retardation in my final year and kinda fucked my grades a little bit, and since then I've just been discontinuing semester after semester for 4 years at uni.

Never had a job, been into pubs to try and get one for a trial and no one likes me - I'm too slow, vacant and boring.  I hate myself, I feel so ugly, and I can't imagine actually being self-sufficient, let alone being reliant for any type of work.

I just read an email my dad sent me a month ago talking about adjusting my CV to apply for this job, mainly noting how I need to find people to ask for ""Coffee meetings"" and shit, list some interests etc, but I don't have any anymore - no realistic ones at least - and I can't function at coffee meetings without specific things to do.

I can't explain the feeling, it's just like, empty.  It's not like depression, not really anxiety or a fear of uncertainty, it's kinda like a transcendence of all 3.

For the past two weeks I keep experiencing déjà vu to the point where nothing feels real or in my control.

I've been on Lithium for 9 years, its been okay and i've been symptom-free for a while. I haven't been to the hospital in about 9 years as well. My only concern with this medication is the long term effects. My TSH levels are high and I'm aware that this can do damage to both the kidneys and thyroid in the long term which is obviously something I don't want. I haven't tried lamictal, but from what I've heard its basically like a safer version of Lithium without the kidney and thyroid problems. If you anyone has taken both, which worked better? Or if you've been on lamictal, how as that helped? I want to avoid any health risks as possible. I just saw my PDOC yesterday. I'm seeing my physician tomorrow in regard to the TSH levels and i'm going to bring up the switch over to lamictal and see what they think. Lamictal got great reviews, about 8.2 - 8.6/10 on various sites. Many people have said it worked wonders and i'm willing to try it out. If it works i'll do the switch over.

39,"I do not think I will last to the end of university. I hope to be be gone before then. I hope at least I have the courage to leave this nightmare which has lasted 6 years by then.

I am 19. My adolescence is nearly spent. The years which are supposed to have formed me have been hell. Living hell. I will never be right if I were to live on.

I was absolutely emotionally and verbally shat on in secondary school. It was physical a very few times. The social group I associated with did not relent. I had no choice.

All it would have taken would have been for a few people my age to reach out to me. Male or female. 

But that doesnt happen unless you are one of the attractive ones. It is a repulsive idea but it is fact. Attractiveness is everything. People flock to them. Be average looking and male, you are disposable. Simple as that. Biological machinary. Garbage. ""Women have it so difficult"". Bull. Shit. Women have it easy  far far easier than they could ever know.

I have not ever experienced any intimacy with someone my age. If you are not in this position, do not expect to understand. Any of the thoughts going through your head on why this is not a bad thing, they are wrong, believe me. It destroys. The image of myself I hold will never be positive.

Maybe some of the people left behind will think ""I didnt see it coming"". Bullshit. I have not been happy for 6 fucking years. I hope it destroys everyone but one who has ever come into contact with me.

My parents should not have had me. They deserve to have what happens on their minds. Shitty, horrible skin from my father that destroyed my self confidence. Depression from my mother who suffered it before having me. THEY KNEW. They fucking knew what they were doing. My life has been inbuilt physical and mental assault. To have damaged mind and body means I have nothing to hide behind.

The one person I care at all about hurting is someone I have been talking to online. They live in chicago. I wish they were here. I will never get to meet them.

That kid you excluded from the group when you all went drinking? He is me. That kid who you took to be some soulless boomworm? He is me. That kid who was awkward, who was laughed at when he talked? He is me. You could have reached out. It would have changed things. 

He is potentially dead. You might not be in contact with him, but there is a chance he is dead. If any of this sounds familiar I hope it eats at you, do not forget.",29Jan2020,1
40,"So I (27f) and my husband (26m) are currently under his insurance through his job. It’s pricey at $800 a month but at least I can see my therapist and psychiatrist and the various other doctors I need because I’m constantly falling apart. Anyway! We’re thinking about either downgrading the insurance because the cost is just so much or getting a new plan altogether, and we started looking at other plans and options I got so overwhelmed because he wants to keep at least some insurance because I have to see a doctor but I’m so broke right now that he pays the entire insurance bill and I hate having to rely so heavily on his income for everything lately. It’s just so shitty that it’s so hard to fucking survive in America with this awful healthcare system and I started to get teary eyed at how frustrating this process is. I’m just generally not doing really well lately and this extra stress is starting to take a toll. I’m new to acknowledging my depression and anxiety and having a hard time dealing with not suppressing it all. This just sucks.",29Jan2020,1
41," I like to think that I am a fine, emotionally stable young man living a happy life. The reality is, deep down I know that I am not. I view the world as a place in which people struggle in, just to get rewarded with absolutely nothing. It is the same in nature, every living organism lives because they have to and because they have to pass on their genes so that another organism that comes from their gametes can also suffer in this horrible world as well…

I get sad sometimes, just thinking of this world. I get sad because I think my mom gets sad, I get sad because I think I did something wrong – just a minor thing, that will result in someone being either hurt or destroyed by it. I get sad because all around the globe people get killed for nothing – suffer for nothing while I am at my house writing this shitty piece of god knows what with absolutely no chance of doing anything to change it. I am emotionally unstable – I stress things that I should not stress that much. I have a final exam tomorrow, and we just moved houses, I wanted to sign up to the gym so that I can get more healthy and actually reduce some of this stress, but now my constant requests around the time span of 2.5 weeks led to an argument between me, my mother and my brother - which destroys me inside.

I think people have flaws, then I get sad because I think people have flaws. It’s like a fucking loop going in my head which makes me sad all the time. I normally don’t care about my thoughts on strangers, for example, if I saw someone walking and spitting on the street, then I think they are just a fucking douche bag and be fine with it. If I do it for people that I hold dear though, such as anyone from my family or my friends, my emotional stability just goes nuts. I sometimes even break things, eat more and become unfocused just because of this shit.

So, knowing that I am emotionally unstable, I am thereby writing this in order to tell people what I view of this world:

I don’t fucking know what causes this, my emotional intelligence or anything, but I fucking hate this flaw of mine. Otherwise, I love my life and the world, and the people I view as “good”.

But, just because of this. Fuck me. Fuck this world and fuck human relations.",29Jan2020,1

For the last 4 months I've been stuck home while occasionally hanging out with what little friends I have left. Staying home not doing anything but playing PlayStation and being incapable of getting a job has left me feeling empty and in a bed mood but nobody can tell cause I keep it in all the time. The only thing keeping me sane is the online friends I've been making but that's not even enough because at the end of the day I still feel like I don't matter to anybody and I have no one to really talk to. I'm always the one people want to say stuff to and vent to and just tell me all there problems then I'm just the funny guy cracking jokes and just being a positive guy that always cares about everyone and always listening. But I always end up scared of saying what's on my mind and then they not be as understanding as I am, so I just keep it all in and move on. Like yesterday I almost started crying to my friend about my personal problem but I didn't want to bum her out so I changed the topic and never told her. My biggest thing is that I just want to feel important to someone and I feel like no matter how hard I try I'll never get the validation I want from anybody.

48,"To begin I’ll just explain my family structure. I am the youngest of three siblings (19, 23 &amp; 30). I’ve always lived with both of my parents, but they actually can’t stand each other and it’s never been touched on, but I believe they’ve only stayed together for the sake of their kids. However, growing up my mom never worked. Mind you I was born in the year 2000, so since then she hasn’t been working &amp; her exposure to the outside world was really limited. Her duties for most of my life were basically to keep the house neat &amp; raise me and my siblings. My parents are both islanders &amp; they are very old fashioned. But... I’ve grown to really resent my mother. When I was younger, she would display that motherly love &amp; made sure I was always happy and going. But as I grew older it’s just as if she couldn’t keep up with me. My mind was growing &amp; I was a curious child but I couldn’t converse with my mom because her emotions and reactions were really simple. I don’t know if she has much of a personality or she’s just really closed off. I try to educate her on some things but she genuinely insists her logic over mind. I don’t know much about her life, her family or really how she even feels because all she’s done in my life is clean, cook and be a house mom. My dad on the other hand was really present in my development &amp; he’s the person I always went to when I had questions. I couldn’t go to my mom because I knew I couldn’t expect an answer. I didn’t expect educated answers from her. From a young age I just learned to doubt her in that aspect. None of my family members really talk to her either, just the daily needed communication to keep this household going. I have been suffering from ongoing depression and my relationship with my mom contributes to it heavily. I feel like she’s gonna die without me really knowing anything about her. She’s kind of a ghost in my life yet she’s always been here. My brothers, my dad and I have acknowledged her mental health for years but we’ve never taken the steps to get her a diagnosis or take her to a doctor. Actually, she’s so against hospitals that I don’t even remember the last time she’s been to a hospital. I’ve always been ashamed of her. I’ve known she was odd since I was little. I’ve been bottling up this confusion, anger and sadness for so many years. I don’t think it bothers my other family members as it does me. I’ve thought time and time again that maybe I’m thinking too critically of her, but I seriously think she’s weird lol. She has a cigarette addiction and I also considered that to contribute to how she acts but i’m unsure. Hopefully someone can understand my frustration and give me some words of wisdom idk. I also know this may be too vague so feel free to ask any questions.",29Jan2020,1
49,"Hi all, I'm not normally a reddit poster, just a reddit lurker, but I guess I wanted some advice (also I'm posting on mobile, not sure if that makes a difference to the text formatting).

Basically, I'm a third year college student working a minimum wage food service job on campus. Right now I'm in my Spring semester. I started my job at the beginning of last year as a regular employee. During the summer break, I got offered a supervisor position and I accepted. My availability was for certain times of the day and overnights, and I expected they would schedule me for some daytime shifts and some overnights, but instead they scheduled me for all overnights. I guess it wouldn't have mattered in the end because by the time I finalized my class schedule, there would have been no time to work during the day anyway. I was taking four classes that each had a run-time of two to three hours and met twice a week each, plus online classes (which to some people, especially STEM majors, may not seem like a lot, or would at least seem pretty average, but it was definitely new to me). In addition, I piled on a bunch of work hours (a bunch for my standards at least) and decided to work five consecutive overnights a week. Here's a rundown of my schedule: my shift started at midnight and ended at 7AM, but as a supervisor, I often stayed later to finish everything up (I also often refused to take mandated breaks to catch up on paperwork, which I was still learning to do), so I really left around 7:30AM. My earliest class started at 9:30AM, so between the time I left work and got to class I had enough time to drive home, take a shower, drive to a bus stop, and take the bus to campus (campus doesnt let you park there after 7:30AM). I'd have classes consecutively until 6PM. After 6PM, I'd have to do whatever hw or projects were due soon, plus squeezing in nap time between then and midnight, which is when I'd work my next shift. Because I either would sleep for such a short period of time per day or not sleep at all, every day started to blend and blur together. I never had the satisfaction of finishing work for the day, because every single shift ending at 7:30AM, I would just think ""I have another shift tonight,"" not ""I have another shift tomorrow."" Plus, as a supervisor, I would be expected to be on call at all times and get constant texts in supervisor group chats, so even when I clocked out from work, I never truly clocked out.

It was extremely demanding for me. I'd often go 36+ hours without sleeping, or if I did sleep, it would be for 3 hours TOPS between days (usually from 8PM to 11PM, as I'd wake up an hour early to get ready for and drive to work). There were even a few times I'd go 50+ hours without sleep, and one time I recall going over 72 hours without sleep. As a college student, going three days straight without sleep isn't unheard of. But when its sandwiched between two 36+ hours of no sleep, totalling to like six or seven hours of sleep for the entire WEEK (I'd have to work on neglected hw and projects on weekends, so there was never a time to catch up on some Z's), it's unbearable. Over halfway through the semester, I switched to a schedule that had me work four overnights instead of five, but schoolwork became incredibly more demanding, especially during final projects season, with disgustingly time-consuming projects that landed me right back on that same sleep schedule, if not worse. I started missing classes because I became desensitized to my alarm and slept through it, and I was even late to work for that reason. At some point in the semester, while driving and parking at a lot near a bus stop, I hit someone's parked car without even noticing. I had to clear it up with the police, but to my sincerest knowledge, I didn't even process the hit because I was so far gone (I had to take a defensive driving course because of this and learned from there that 24 hours without sleep is equivalent to a .1 on the BAC, and I was 30 hours without sleep at that time, so that's pretty bad). I was becoming an actual hazard due to all this.

I'm not writing all of this to gain pity. I know that that schedule totally sucked and I know that I brought it upon myself for choosing to work those hours (I really needed the money). I'm writing all this so you understand just how bad it was, at least for me personally. Which is why it still boggles me that, while I gained some anxiety from it, I never really ""crashed"" during this time. I burnt myself out, yes, but I didn't crash. This time, which lasted from August to December, lead to zero mental breakdowns, even though I was close. That doesn't mean it was a walk in the mental park by any means, but it wasn't as bad as it could have been. It boggles me even more, though, that now in January when I'm only working three overnights and have less demanding classes, I'm suddenly rifed with extreme anxiety and paranoia. I'm depressed as well, but that's been with me since I was like twelve. I've never been the anxious type, and I really thought that since I never had such a big anxiety problem last semester when all that schedule stuff was going on, so I thought I was home free. Now, though, I wake up in the middle of the night thinking I'm missing something and I often have ""dreams"" while I'm half awake about imaginary events that I should be worried about. Stuff like having to go to a meeting at work, or having to cover someone's shift, or having done the paperwork wrong. I wake up talking gibberish out loud to myself and having my heart pounding out of my chest because I genuinely believe I have something at work or in class that I should be doing and having a genuine half-conscious panic attack, which leads me to losing sleep duirng this time. When I finally come to, I realize that absolutely none of what I imagined was even real or worth worrying about. I'm constantly paranoid that police will confront me for crimes I didn't commit, or that I've committed a traffic felony without even processing it. I question my memory constantly. My short term memory has completely fried to the point where I have a hard time even remembering if the light I just ran was green or red, which I only have reassurance on whenever I'm driving with other cars in adjacent lanes (since I often drive at night to work though, and there are usually little to no cars at that time, I don't have that reassurance then). I'm not at all motivated to carry out school work and my mental space is almost at a worse place than it was last semester. I get ""passive anxiety"", where I'll literally just be sitting doing nothing and all of a sudden I'm getting heart palpitations. I'm at the brink of panic attacks at all times and it's ruining my sleep schedule once again. I have so much pent up anger and anxiety that I often contemplate self harm to let it all out, which is something I used to do years ago and prefer not to resort to again. I'm not functioning anymore. I've never had it this bad.

I know the likely answer to all this is that I trained my brain to expect erratic schedules last semester and so the change of pace is suddenly making my brain upset and anxious. That, or because I didn't have time to be anxious last semester, I repressed it all and it's all coming out now. Still, I can't help but feel crazy, especially when people keep telling me that I should be functioning better since I'm not dealing with the same workload as last semester. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? I'm already in therapy, and the sessions help in the moment, but it isn't helping long term and I can't financially afford another therapist or more sessions, so that's out of the equation unfortunately. Many thanks in advance to any advice anyone can give.

TLDR; I had an overly demanding scheduled that completely ruined my internal sleeping clock and now I'm paying for it through excessive anxiety that won't let me function.",29Jan2020,1

55,"During the period last year of me going in and out of hospitals and partial programs, I always felt alone in my struggle with homicidal thoughts along with suicidal thoughts. People don't know that that's common with OCD. 
In the world where people actually talk about mental health, which I am so lucky to be a part of, people think of the words ""suicidal thoughts"" as actively self-harming usually depicted as cutting. Then they think, ""Well if having suicidal ideations is actively hurting yourself, with someone with homicidal thoughts, it might be me!"" And avoid you because you're seen as dangerous and psycho.
But I continued to be open about my homicidal thoughts to anyone at school who asked in depth where I was during my absence and why. For that, I lost a lot, and I knew I would. I lost friendships, people's trust, the chance of getting parts/solos in choir and in the school musical. Because I never want anyone to feel as alone as I felt. I wanted to let someone, anyone, know that they are not a psychopath or wrong for experiencing homicidal ideations. People should get help for it like you would for suicidal thoughts. So I stripped myself socially naked, and made myself completely vulnerable, because there was a chance that me being open would help someone. Then, in a group chat with a bunch of people from the partial program I went to, multiple people told me that me being open and sharing my own coping skills saves their lives everyday. And to me, that is the ultimate gift- to be able to help people so dearly with their mental health, to be grateful, and to be kind. I couldn't ask for anything more. And I still don't. When people say I'm so kind for doing something and that good karma is coming my way, I say it already has.

59,"18 years of my life wasted. 18 years you fucking made me the little bitch who would answer to everyone’s questions or help them do something since “it’s always a good karma builder”. 18 years spent pretending we had no money when in reality you were just funneling it to your mom who no one in your family likes. 18 years making me stay at home on the weekends with a deranged mom and study in constant fear of being abused by a mother who had her occasional depressive yet abusive episodes. Ironic I know. It all started piecing together when I had my first brush in with the law, when I first stole iPhones from my classmates to sell to get cash that you started unraveling. My principal and the two officers looked at you with blind disgust when you said “please sir let my son go I’ll pay the 1000 for the two phones that he stole “. I had a Nokia back then and you argued that you had it worse. You never cared about the people who had it better. You always talked about the people who had it worse. Well now it’s catching up to you. I should have graduated by now. But by some sheer stupidity I got kicked out of my dream college and am back now in the same fucking putrid city trying to transfer to another college. Now that I’m 21 I’m fucking done with you dad. I’m going to work my ass off to be a doctor and let you and mom behind in the dust. You don’t know how much it hurts but I’m going to make you feel it just like you wanted to compare my situation to people who had it worse. I’m sitting in my cafeteria not even planning on coming home since I’m fucking done with both you and mom and I hope my brother sees through this. He tells me he cries for me since he doesn’t have it as bad. I just hope he makes it out with his sanity since I never could.",29Jan2020,1

61,"Hi everyone, I'm Pablo, and a couple of months ago I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Chronic Fatigue.

I used to laugh at mental health memes before, thinking that I was immune to this thing, and usually I made jokes about anxiety; without realising that I was feeding my own without knowing it. 

After a couple of months, shit just got worse, and I started sleeping less, I got easily annoyed by anything, I was really sad and I felt like the whole world was crashing on me. 


But now, after two anxiety attacks during schooltime and trying to express the hell I was going through to my family and going to therapy and start medication has made me more aware of this, and that not everyone is having the time of their lifes.

It used to feel like I was screaming in a crowded room and nobody would look up, but now there's no crowd and I don't scream anymore. I feel alone and used and like my existence doesn't mean anything. I haven't impacted anyone's life. I haven't done anything great. My friends arent my friends, they only need me when its convenient to them. My family would be ok without me. I go unnoticed by them all the time. My boyfriend cheated on me for so long so I know he can move on just fine. It just hurts to be here. Im not planning my death, but I feel it coming. And its no one's fault. I just can't do it.

For about a year now I’ve been having terrible OCD. I’m not really quite sure how or why it started, probably the stress of life and a lot of change. For the last year I’ve basically been living on egg shells needing every single thing in my room to remain in its exact spot, inability to throw things away or get rid of old clothes, only able to wear the same five things. On top of that every time I leave my house (room) I do the same routine over and over and over until I feel less anxious. 

These compulsions and bad habits are finally catching up to me and affecting my everyday life. I’m late to work almost everyday and every other activity in my life. I can’t settle into my room because I’m too afraid to get rid of things and move things around.

I’ve been seeing a therapist for the last six months but it doesn’t really seem to help. I’m on here seeking advice from other people who also experience and live with OCD.

Thank you for listening and any advice you might have, I’m so sick of living like this.",29Jan2020,1
64,"Now I just need to say two things to start this out: 1. I'm mostly just rambling. I hate being public about this but feel like this could potentially be the place to just come out and say it, and maybe feel good. 2. This might not be the right place. Seems like it could work though...

For the longest time, I can't ever remember being real. Someone will say a joke, but I can almost choose to react to it or not. Someone can straight up offend me, I'll realize it should offend me, but it just... Doesn't? Someone will compliment me and I don't really feel it, but I know that I should respond. When I get sad, I don't really go crazy. My mind goes blank, but in a bad way. When I feel ""sad"", I really just get this sense of feeling heavy, and my blood pressure rises, pulse slows. Its just the strangest feeling. I've never attempted suicide, because I've always had enough control to resist. But its like every time this happens, I get overly sad, I feel my control slip. And on top of that, its like everything I say is a lie. As I look back I feel like all of this is just a lie to feel better for myself! I don't get it! I say something out of nothing but kindness, and think about just how fucking manipulative it is! If I want something I can easily word things in a way to prompt the answer, but its like I can't turn it off.

What I'm wondering most is, how long do we have to keep an eye on her? I fully expect someone wanting to commit suicide to say they are all right at some point just to get people to leave them alone.

She is talking to a psychologist and psychiatric and just recently got a new diagnosis and hopefully the correct medication. Should we wait until her psychologist and/or psychiatric give us the 'green light' that she's not suicidal anymore? Should we trust and respect her own wishes when she says she's okay, even though she might be lying? How do you trust someone in these situations?

Any other tips on how to best support her would be greatly appreciated.

73,College is literally killing me. Everday I'm at college. Some days u have it 9 hours. My mental health has gone crazy. In the middle of my hw i just had enough and picked up a knife and started cutting my wrist. I can't be there anymore I dont want to go there anymore. I feel miserable and afraid of my future. Afraid of being a fail ure and unhappy. I dont want to go to class tomorrow. I want to drop out but u am afraid of what other will think of me. I'm so tired. I'm so tired.

74,"It's like every day, I'm scared of something new. Even the smallest sound leading me to ""This is it, I'm going to die and I can't do anything"".  
 I don't know why it's getting worse, but it's hard to focus, to sleep, to even go to the movies.   
 I had my first panic attack in years not long ago, where I was just full out crying and shaking, which is something that I rarely did, even when I had attacks as a child. And why? Because I wasn't sitting in my regular seat in the car and someone had their window open.   
 I'm struggling to fall asleep because any noise automatically translates to ""Someone is in my house, they're going to kill me, this is it"" and it's always just someone waking up to use the restroom. Even when I'm fully asleep, I'm just hyperaware of everything, I can't get the idea of danger out of my head.  
 Sometimes I take my ideas to my fiance to try and calm down, and he usually helps but it only lasts for a short bit before I'm panicking again. I always feel bad when I have to keep going to him to calm down, I know it's not his job to do that. Sometimes playing video games is a helpful distraction but whenever there's a moment where I might lose, or a cutscene where I can't do anything, it floods back all over again.   
 I used to have paranoia that I've been working at getting over but it was never anything like this. The fear of death and pain always in the back of my mind, obsessively going online and checking just to make sure the people I'm close to haven't stopped caring about me. The smallest noise or movement sending my heart into a frenzy.   
 I don't want to die, but when I feel in danger like that, I always just immediately give up.   
""I'm scared but what could I even do? I'm not strong enough to fight off death, I guess it's just my time to die.""  
I have some health problems and one of them links to raised anxiety but it doesn't even feel like my regular anxiety anymore. It feels like I'm just... Constantly living in fear.  
 The normal worries feel like nothing anymore. Talking to strangers, having job interviews, speaking on the phone, it doesn't bother me anymore, it feels like nothing.  
I don't know why I feel this way anymore. I haven't had a therapy appointment in about two months and everyone else I try to talk to doesn't take me seriously or doesn't respond. But... I started keeping knives by my bed, I'm beginning to have nightmares, oversleeping just to avoid the day. I've stopped trying. I'm not depressed, I honestly feel really happy a lot, but it's hanging over me like a cloud, reminding me every day, over and over that no matter what, something can kill me and I don't know when or how, and there's nothing I could do to stop it.",29Jan2020,1

This is a vent, I guess. 

Trigger warning for discussion of eating habits, exercise, weight and suicidal thoughts (I’m safe, though, so no need to worry).

I consider myself a perfectionist. My grades are in the top percentile; I’m in my last semester of High School and I’m projected to get straight into the law school of my choice this fall. My grades are partly the result of luck, but they have a lot to do with discipline, too. I wrote my dissertation in a month (we were supposed to work with it for six). I’m incapable of not studying. I’ll go to school and spend time studying unless I’m physically unable to.

School is not the only aspect of my life where I’m a perfectionist. I go to bed at 8-9 pm and wake up at 5 am so that I have time to exercise, do yoga and meditate before I walk to school. I eat exclusively healthy food and never indulge (I eat a lot less than I should, but that’s another issue altogether). I never indulge in other luxuries, either. I get anxious spending money, so I’m preoccupied by saving it and planning my spendings (even though I live at home with a family with money to spend). 

Even though I feel insecure without makeup and with the same clothes I’ve been wearing for the past half-decade, I can’t really justify spending time or money on those things. It’s just not reasonable. I’m moving out this fall, and I’m planning every expense I need to account for, from textbooks to kitchen equipment. I live in Norway, so the degree itself doesn’t cost anything and I get a lot of support from the state, and my parents are happy to help, but I still can’t justify spending 50 dollars on a pair of shoes, even if my feet hurt. 

In any case, aside from my lacking sense of fashion, my life is objectively great. I live in Norway, I’m from a privileged household, I’m not sick. I do all the things I’m supposed to: I get good grades, I exercise, I eat healthy, I go to bed early (though I struggle to fall and stay asleep). I meditate and do yoga. I’m not bullied, I haven’t had any particularly traumatic experiences. My family is lovely and my classmates are nice. Sure, I don’t have much of a social life, but that’s a result of my priorities. 

Objectively, my life is almost perfect. But I’m still miserable and exhausted. 

There is just a relentless force within me pushing me to always be more. I feel prepared for my test? How can I be sure? It’s better to just continue studying. I have an essay due in a month? Better write it all in the span of two days because waiting is a sign of laziness and imperfection. Besides, I might get another essay next week, so it’s better to just get this done. I exercise an hour a day, five times a week? Time to up that to up that to an hour and a half or sit around feeling guilty for not exercising more. 

Despite the exercise, I eat less than the recommended amount of calories. Even though I’m underweight and desperately want to build muscle to look and feel more fit, I can’t shake the mentality that A) I don’t actually need to eat more, the internet is lying to me, and if I don’t need to, I shouldn’t eat, B) I’m afraid if I indulge I won’t stop and C) I’m afraid of gaining unwanted weight. Yesterday I tried to push myself to eat more, and it genuinely made me want to kill myself because I felt awful, and I don’t want to deal with this fight every time I eat. I calmed myself down, obviously, but the feeling still lingers. I have a plan about how I’d kill myself, and I know where I’d do it. I’m not planning on doing it, though. At least I don’t think so.

I am so exhausted, both physically and mentally. I’m running on the fumes of my own dedication and discipline. I’m constantly at a battle with my own mind. I don’t prioritize self-care and things that make me happy:  I don’t even know what would make me happy anymore, because the things I usually enjoy just annoy me or make me feel bad. I only know what I should be doing, and if I’m not doing it, I feel awful. 

My life isn’t even that bad. I’m not a single-mother juggling three jobs. I’m not a sleep-deprived soldier. I’m not working 14 hours at a sweatshop every day. I’m a 19-year-old girl living in Norway, whose only “job” is school. Each and every one of my problems are caused by my own brain and the invisible rules it has imposed on me. 

Part of me wants to just drop out of therapy because I feel stupid for causing myself all of this misery. Part of me wants to just curl up into a ball in bed and lie there until I die. Part of me wants to just cease to exist just so that I’ll stop being so exhausted, because I feel that’s the only way to actually feel at peace. I’m powerless to stop myself from doing the things I “should” be doing. I’m stuck in an imaginary prison and I can’t survive a lifetime of this.

I’m seeing my therapist in Monday, but idk if I’ll tell him about my darker thoughts. I tend to have periods where I feel really low every two-three months, and they never turn dangerous. So the feelings should settle in a week or so if I just brave on through them, and I don’t want to make a big deal out of them knowing that. 

I don’t know what I expect from sharing this. I’m just sad, and I needed to get this off my chest. I don’t know if anyone can relate, but if you do, I hope you feel better soon.",29Jan2020,1

just got off facetime with my lovely girlfriend of only about 4.5 months. shes taking pre-med and lives with a very cool family. they are Czech people who grew up in Soviet Russia essentially so they have some semi-traditional views on things but her dad is a pharmacist so I'd be hard pressed to find out he doesn't believe in mental illness. her mom is lovely and I can only imagine she'd be supportive too.

my girlfriend has never ever told anyone that she harms herself, not even her absolute best friends that she spends so much time around so the fact that she told me means so much and I'm happy she trusts me that much. 

I've had my suspicions that something was up because she never accepts my Compliments and always says she's gross and so on but I made no quick judgements. tonight she spilled pretty much everything to me and told me she felt numb when she did it and because she hasn't been doing well on her exams, she did it as ""punishment."" which were her words, not mine. since she's taking pre-med to become a pediatrician, she is very swamped with homework and Its making her very stressed but she said she'll feel like a failure if she stops and does something like nursing instead. 

**main question and tldr**

tldr: girlfriend told me she made small cuts on her hip, I noticed them last time we had sex and I asked what happened but I really didn't think too much of it but she told me she made them a few days later but she said she doesn't know why

82,"TW: depression, suicide, brief mention of self harm. 

Cross posted to: r/advice , r/internetparents , r/depression, r/mentalhealth

Back story: When I was an adolescent I was seriously depressed.  In and out of hospitals, taking eight medications a day, self harming,  I had several serious suicide attempts along with some not so serious suicide attempts and so on. It took a huge toll on our parents and I think it’s part of the reason why their marriage is falling apart. During this part of my life I had basically no relationship with my mother because due to my depression she became absolutely crazy and impossible to interact with. I moved from Florida to Spain in the middle of April 2019 I have since then made a whole life here. Since then my life has significantly improved and I have a better relationship with my mother. I think it’s important to mention that I am overseas from where my family lives. 

In mid October 2019 my brother called me while I was at work hysterically crying saying that he’s super frustrated with school and our parents. He’s always had a history of disliking school, in fact when he was in the fifth grade he was diagnosed with ADHD but no longer takes Adderall nor any of the other medications because he doesn’t like the way it makes him feel. Anyway, when I spoke to him in October high felt that he was kind of depressed and I kind of saw myself in him when I was his age. Since moving I’ve been the referee between my brother and our parents, mostly my mother. Whenever my brother needs to communicate something important he will call me and I will relay the information to my parents. So on that occasion I called my parents and I had them know that Yayo (brother) was becoming increasingly stressed and depressed because of school and that he needed therapy. They proceeded to find him a therapist and he dropped out of regular high school to go to a special high school where he only goes a few hours a day and they give him the bare minimum to get his credits. 

Forward to yesterday, I wake up to find a message from our father. It was a message explaining that he had had a meeting at Yayo’s school He was explaining that he had had a meeting with the academic director Regarding how many credits my brother needs. At one point my brother is called into the office and they start telling him that he only has four credits left that it’s so easy that it’s just one little push and he can be over with it. Whenever I ask a question my brother would only respond with monosyllables he had put on my dad would call an ass face (cara de culo) like he didn’t want to be there and didn’t care what anyone had to say.  My mom and sends me a message telling me that my father had a meeting at school with the academic director and my brother and that I should speak to my brother and explain to him that he only has a little bit left to go because I’m the only one he listens to. 

Yayo then calls me I could tell by his voice (his faking a phone smile voice) that he wants okay. He started crying and venting telling me that he feels like mom and dad don’t understand him. He feels like he’s a fuck up I’m not mom always compares him to me because I was a fuck up but then I wasn’t. And he just feels like shit whenever She makes those comparisons. And then dad is always telling him that he only has a little bit left to go and that makes him feel like even more of a fuck up because getting those last four credits should be just so easy but for him it feels just as impossible as jumping across the Atlantic ocean. He’s telling me that he’s always bullshitting school and that he spends half the time asleep. That mom and dad think that it’s just because he’s lazy when in reality he’s completely capable of doing shit he doesn’t like like going to work, and then he says it’s just because school isn’t for him he feels like he isn’t capable of completing it.  I asked him what exactly does he want, and he says that he doesn’t know he quite frankly isn’t even thinking about his future. He stars saying that he wished that he could just stay in bed and never have to get up, that he just wants to quit life. He can’t imagine himself in the future. I asked him if he was having suicidal ideation and he said that he had thought of offing himself but not seriously enough to plan anything. I then asked him how long he had been having these thoughts. He said less than 3 months. I told him that I was not asking for his permission but that I didn’t want his consent to tell our parents. I gave him the example of if he told me that he had stage to lung cancer I would have to tell mom and dad it’s not something I can keep to myself same with suicidal ideation. And he told me that although he completely understands that it’s something that I have to tell them he wishes that I wouldn’t because that’s only going to make him look like a fuck up even more. He told me that it’s OK that he’s not going to lose trust in me and that he gets it. 

I then spoke with my parents and the conversation that I had with them made me feel very scared. The conversation I had with him made me feel very scared because the impression that I got from them was that of annoyance. That they don’t have time to deal with this shit. I know they love him but when I told my mother that he doesn’t like it when she compares him to me she just came up with excuses like “oh I’m not comparing him I’m just giving him good examples” I told her that’s besides the point whatever term she wants to use for what she does whether it be example or comparison that she should not use my name in conversations regarding his future if she knows that hurts him. Then my dad told me that he just feels irritated at the whole situation that he definitely needs a new therapist because this therapist isn’t working out. Our dad acted like it’s just another problem another excuse for him not to get his credits out. He said “Yayo is sick in the head”.  My mom said “I just don’t understand why he can’t tell us this shit why does he tell you and not us?!?”  I feel like the conversation that I had with them was absolutely fruitless and it was more of a burden than anything else. 

I thought my parents had learned from the situation that I was in and how it was the worst time if our lives when I was sick. I don’t want to lose my brother to suicide. Our birthdays are 3 years and 364 days apart (mine on the 20th and his on the 21st) we’ve always celebrated our birthdays together and I would hate to live in a world in which I can’t share my birthday with the person I love most in this world. He’s my best friend I love him I adore him he’s my baby brother and I don’t want this to get so bad that I lose him.  I don’t know what to do Im scared and I just want to help. 

TDLR: my brother is depressed just like I was when I was an  adolescent, my parents seem absolutely clueless as to how serious it is.

83,"for example you can't remember some things that you talked about with people, even if they're important. for example I tend to forget I talked about something with someone and then start the same serious topic again and when people tell me that we already talked about it and that they told me everything and that I agreed with them I get scared because I have no clue what they told me. it always turns out like I don't pay attention to them which is untrue 

this is just one example so I can explain my question better.

84,"Outside of my partner whom I do love, and my first love which developed in high school, I don't feel anything for other people. I don't care about either of my parents or any of my three siblings. I've had many short-term friends whom I've lost because of motivation to stay connected, due to not feeling any platonic love for them. I have a 'best friend' who I've known for over 14 years, who knows everything about me. And while we get along really well, make each other laugh a lot, share many stories and memories, I wouldn't mind if he disappeared.   


I've taken psychopathy and sociopathy tests, but I really don't fit the mould. I don't enjoy harming others, and while I have manipulated many people in the past for my benefit, it's not something I actively try to do, if it can be avoided. I've felt this way for nearly all my life and I've been hoping it would go away on its own, but nothing has changed, which leads me to believe that it could be a mental illness or condition.

In reality, I'd rather spend time by myself, or with just one person. Also, ironically, I never seem to break the small talk barrier, and no one cares to be my friend unless they need something from me.

88,"And I just really realized this today. I do go to therapy, and we are in those ""tough"" stages.
My therapist asked me when was the last time I was actually truly happy. And I realized, in nearly 40 years, I've never been. At the same time, I don't feel like I'm classically ""depressed"". A lot of it I think is just purely environmental.
I suffered abuse and neglect throughout my childhood. I moved out about as early as I possibly and legally could, with a woman I thought it would go well with, but surprise surprise she also turned abusive once we lived together. Once I finally got the balls to leave that, I tried to flee everything altogether, and moved out of state. Literally right before I moved (like as I was packing the morning I was headed off) a friend dropped a bombshell that messed me up for quite a while.
When I finally started to work that out, I got into a relationship where the woman turned addict.
Once I started to work that out, I did FINALLY meet a genuinely good woman, then immediately got a long, traumatic illness that left me crippled. And that's where I remain today.
Not really sure if I just needed to vent or am looking for advice or what. I guess this is just something I've never thought about, or pushed out of my mind. Coming to the realization that this has been my life, it's hitting quite hard. I guess I just hope I can eventually overcome everything and actually experience no strings attached joy at some point in my life.",29Jan2020,1

95,"So tldr, I was taking alot of time off usually mondays due to anxiety and generally feeling like shit(non stop negative thoughts etc..) I eventually went to the docs to get a note off them to get 2 weeks off work to focus on myself or at least try too. 

Upon returning to work I was issued with a PIP(Performance Improvement Plan) despite providing a doctors note for those 2 weeks off (manager said he warned me before the 2 weeks then I had taken those 2 weeks because at that point I was close to breaking point) Now every 2 weeks I get a meeting for this, everytime it seems like they try to look for something to say im not doing good enough be it that my work stats were bad(before leave they were due to feeling like shit and being swamped on negative thoughts making me even worse) or the fact I was late two times over xmas on the 2 days before new year, I explained that this was due to buses being off but they still weren't happy, thing is though our work is meant to be Flexi based however the line manager seems to be applying a rule only to me for being in on 8 on the dot... While others come in earlier to finish early and others come in later to do 10 or 9 till 6 and 5. 

Im lost at the moment, I feel like utter shit again and just being in work feels like it makes me worse not to mention when im like this all motivation goes to do work I end up sitting staring at screens just overthinking on shit in my life(haven't had the best start in life put it that way) 

Really feel like I should have called up sick, but due to being on this PIP report I've been told to reduce abcenses and if I go on anymore it'll be taken further with HR? 

I was told that this report was to help staff however it feels like this is just a way to remove me from my job(which I really need if I lose this I dunno what Ill do) and to make my work life hell. Like I say seems like its one rule for me and rules for others and it seems like they really dont care about my mental health despite trying to explain stuff to them, they said they did care when flat out brought this up with my team lead but their Actions say otherwise e.g on breakfast this morning despite looking like shit and staying quiet he didnt once even think of asking if I was okay. Just feel like im more bother being here in the world for people...

105,"Hi All,

My brother (42yo) has been in and out of depressive episodes for many years now. According to him, he's been struggling with mental health for nearly 20 years. Lately though, it has taken a turn for the worse and he has appeared to become suicidal.

A few months back he had sent me some rambling text messages about hating his life, so I gathered up the family and headed over to his house.  When I arrived I realized he was incredibly drunk, he tends to self-medicate with alcohol... Speaking with him, he let me know that he hated his life, hated waking up in the morning to go to work and just wanted to end it. I felt like most of this was the alcohol talking, so I ended up trying my best to talk to him, but it was useless at the time. We left and I went back a few days later when I knew he was sober. During that conversation it was a little easier to talk to him. I had asked him if he had ever thought about how, or when he would kill himself and he said no. This conversation we had made me feel decent enough where I didnt think he was going to take his life.

Fast forward to the past few days and it looks like he's back at it. My brother is gay (accepted to the family and everything). His boyfriend has reached out to my sister, basically saying that my brother is out of control. That he's back at it with wanted to take his life. Any suggestions for going to see a counselor are basically ignored. He says that most counselors are ""More fucked up than I am""... He says that he ends up counseling them... He also says that he cannot stand the way meds make him feel.

I am in a terrible spot. I have been dealing with him for a number of years. 10-15 years ago he had serious issues with alcohol (which never really went away). I want to help my brother, but I feel like he doesnt want to be helped. Additionally I have my own family to worry about with two little kids and a wife. I cannot mentally afford to be wrapped up in my brothers issues. My sister is a little rougher around the edges and has said that she is seriously considering committing him (not sure of the details...).

I'm just kind of in a hard spot and am looking to see if anyone has gone through something similar and if you have any thoughts or recommendations.

Thanks!",29Jan2020,1
106,"After a breakdown in work yesterday, I finally decided that I could no longer admit to myself I could work in that environment or pretend I was okay. I decided I will quit and go get help.

However this all came crashing to an all time low since I graduated, I went right into a job and never gave myself sufficient time to recover or be kind to myself. 

I guess my lesson is to put yourself first and don't leave it too late, I genuinely believe having poor mental health and working in a bad environment has left me mentally scarred.

112,"I'm studying for my second year at university at the moment, and have had the toughest last few months in my life.

My first year I didn't take that much stress about my GPA, but still did my best and even worked 16 hours a week on average and had a healthy amount of stress and succeeded in my courses. And I started my first relationship a bit before the summer. 

The fall of my second-year studies was when things started to go downward, and I couldn't read the signs before it was too late. I had ambitious goals for my course grades, but this was something I also had last year, the difference was that I now ""had to"" get the grades rather than ""I would like to have these grades"", which afterwards thinking was a toxic way of thinking. But I thought I could go through it since I've done it earlier also without any extreme consequences, but in addition to this, I was in a relationship which stressed me a lot (which I didn't realize until after the burnout). And the combination of school stress as well as relationship stress kept me awake at night and stressed, but my mindset about stress was during that time fucked up, and I thought that stress just increases my performance and I just kept going. 

After stressing my mind out during the first period I decided to take a more chill approach and started to meditate and not put high expectations on my grades since I just felt grossed out from the last 1,5 months of stressing. One week into the second period I suddenly felt a bit dizzy, and I felt like my brain didn't function properly, my short-term memory was extremely bad, and I just felt grossed out about school work etc. And I felt like I couldn't feel anything, so this was obviously a burnout which was also confirmed by a doctor.

I had the luxury that I could take a vacation of my studies during the second period without it affecting my schooling, so I did it. I talked to a therapist, did my research on how to get better, and actively sought for help and improvement to my wellbeing.  After 1-2 months school free, I felt better, but long story short I came to the realization that if I want to recover 100% I have to break up with my girlfriend (which obviously was a hard decision, but a decision which I had to do), after the breakup I had 1 month before the starting of the new school period, and I felt good and ready to get back to school.

Two weeks ago when the schools started, I felt extremely anxious about going to the school, but I still did go and studied (naturally shorter periods of time, than I used to) and used all the knowledge that I had acquired during my rest period, to minimize stress and to just get the courses done. Even though I didn't feel stressed about school, I noticed that same burnout symptoms are creeping up, as not sleeping on nights, a sometimes dizzy sight, a bit slower thought process and a small headache. 

And I'm scared that if I continue my studies now at the moment, I will burnout again, or feel as bad as I feel at the moment. But then again the other theory I and my therapist have here is, that I have rested for 3 months (even though this period included a semi stressful breakup) and my wellbeing could increase if I get back to school, to my normal things. My therapist has also asked me if I would like to have some antidepressants, which I have always been against for, but because of my current wellbeing I have started to think about them, and if they would have a positive impact on my short-term and long-term functionality so that I could execute my schoolwork normally.

The other option I have thought about has been, that I would now during the third period take away the one and only major course which is from the more advanced side, and only Finnish my two other courses which are from the easier and wouldn't on their own cause unbearable stress, and then for my 4 period and for the summer vacation I would rather than work go on a vacation for this whole time, either backpacking or going to do some semi-light work in a resort in a exotic and relaxing environment. And continuing doing self-development, on every aspect of my life. With this option, my graduation would draw out with 0,5-1 year, but this would not cause any extra tuition fees, only extra costs in terms of travelling expenses and lost potential income. This option is something that I know that would make me happy, and make me feel good, but I'm scared that it wouldn't solve the problem and I would just be 1 year behind my studies, and jumping back in my studies would then be even harder.

113,"I've already been perfecting my health and fitness, and am doing my best to hit my life goals. But, because of how I was raised by my parents, I now get anxiety disorders and have a perfectionist tendency. I've also suffered from OCD in the past, though it seems to change with diet.

My father was very strict and I got yelled at for every little error. Especially at the dinner table.

116,"I have always detested physical contact as long as I can remember. I was very mildly molested at a young age.  This seemed to be the origin but no amount of therapy has changed the fact that I break out into a sweat at the prospect of shaking someone's hand, much less any kind of sexual activity. I was a depressed child as a result, I had resolved to kill myself in the second grade. I have been procrastinating the act ever since. 

I had no friends in school as the avoidance I had at anyone I was even slightly attracted to made people assume I was gay. This made me avoid anyone of the same sex for the same reason. I have trudged through decades of acting out the part of a human being. I have a career that paid for my house and all the video games in the world, none of which playing brings any real distraction. 

I escaped into marijuana use for a time, which allowed me to more convincingly play the part of a lover. I even convinced a woman to marry me. I spend my time taking care of her, cooking, cleaning, etc, but she has recently made it clear she is not sexually satisfied. Without marijuana as a psychological crutch I am unable to overcome my horror at performing intimacy. I am not sure what I should do as my current job requires a great deal of mental effort which weed interferes with. In any event I was becoming more depressed with chronic use anyway. It is very dificult for me to talk about this with my wife in a productive manner as I become very emotional.

I am not even sure I am looking for any real advice here, just hoping that I can get some of my frustration out by sharing it with the outside world. In my experience, being alone with nothing to live for while everyone else goes about their day part of some big joke I'm not privy to is worse than whatever death may bring.

121,"i suffer with severe mental health issues really badly and nobody knows exactly how much i'm hurting on a daily basis, nobody messages me and asks me if i'm doing okay or if i need a hug which hurts me. nobody asks me if i want to meet up with them for a friendly chat or even if its just for a really long hug, I have no real friends and i'm all alone in this world with no real support 😭.

I've tried getting all the help their is and im in therapy till October 2020 which by the way i don't think is working for me as it should be, I should of being sectioned under the mental health act 1983 because i am a danger to myself and i have thoughts about hurting other people but i take all that anger and punish myself for it because i deserve every inch of pain i get not other people.

Reason why i haven't being sectioned is because in the UK the NHS like to put you in the community for help first and they say that getting sectioned is the last resort and they wont put you down as a involuntary patient unless you are very very seriously ill which i am but they dont see it that way?.

They would rather try and work with you to get you back on you're feet to recovery, slap you on medication and leave you to live you're life? which i find is disgusting. i'm not targeting america here but i will say that they get it way easier to be sectioned than over here in the UK which i find to be very unfair. the NHS wont section people because they are under-funded, over-run and in massive amounts of debt?.

122,"I think it’s safe to say I’ve been depressed most of my life, but I noticed two years ago that during my period my depression would skyrocket and the suicidal tendencies were so high I would stay in my room in bed to keep from hurting myself. I realized this wasn’t normal when all my friends were looking at me like a crazy person when I told them. Fast forward and this past year I had a great job where I was promoted to a manager extremely quickly, had a great social life and was doing well in school and even with all that my depression was crazy. A lots changed very fast. It’s my senior year of high school and I transferred schools halfway through the year bc I moved, got a new job and all my friends turned out not to really be my friends. Whatever. Didn’t think it’d be a big deal bc I’ve changed schools so often and people come and go. Well after  my first day everything went downhill. It’s like my anxiety, depression, mood, everything just took a nosedive. Daily anxiety attacks, hourly suicidal thoughts, constantly spacing out. I’ll go days without sleeping and I’ll be so tired. And when j finally sleep it’s for maybe an hour or two and I back to awake and exhausted. I’ve been leaving in the middle of my classes because it’ll be to much to handle, I’ll get so stuck in my head that I feel like if I just don’t get out I’ll explode. It’s like my fight or flight is constantly stuck on flight. I feel like I have to run the second my chest constricts. I’ve also been incredibly paranoid lately, anytime anyone laughs or whispers or even glances in my direction I think they’re talking negatively about me even when I obviously know they aren’t. It’s like my thoughts overpower the rational part of my brain. I’ve started self harm again after two years of being clean. Eating has become so hard, I’ll be starving but the thought of food makes me nauseous. I honestly just want to know what’s going on. I have a slight suspicion and I know I definitely have some anxiety issues but I’ve never been so bad mentally that I’m this frustrated. If anyone takes the time to read this... thoughts?",29Jan2020,1
123,"Also posted in r/relationships and r/Anxiety. Looking for more help and advice so posting in additional places.

So I'm going to try to condense this and keep it as short and to the point as possible. I've been cheated on in the past, more than once, and I was in an emotionally abusive and manipulative ""relationship"" (we never labeled it, another part of the abuse) a couple years ago. After getting out of that, I had a small gap of time single then dated someone for 2 or so years. The relationship was safe, the guy was safe, and I settled for sure. We broke up at the beginning of last year and a couple months later I started dating my now boyfriend, who is someone I've actually known for over a decade 

While with my ex, I finally started therapy and seeing a psychiatrist and was put on anxiety meds. And it helps tremendously. I moved after the breakup and have since found an amazing therapist and a great doctor for my prescriptions. However, I still struggle with intrusive thoughts and constant pangs of doubt and worry and wondering if I can trust my gut instinct anymore after the abusive relationship I was in. It was part of the reason for the breakup with my ex. My boyfriend now has his own depression he deals with daily, on top of insomnia, and his own issues.

My insecurities and jealousies are not a result of anything he has ever done to me, and he has in fact bene an open book with me always when I ask. However it is now getting to be tiring for him, and me as well, and it's this horrible habit I have that I want to break. I hate myself for asking him what he's doing or who's that or who's he talking to or what's that on his phone or computer or whatever. Part of it comes from a place of genuine and nosy curiosity, something I've had since I was little, just wanting to be involved and know what's going on. But part of it comes form the insecurity that he'll replace me or have more fun without me. And the fact is that acting this way is what would cause that to begin with.

He also recently was reached out to by an ex (though they didn't even date for 6 months, over 3 years ago, and both agree 10000% they are better as friends and neither is interested) and she wanted to be friends and was even willing to talk to me too. I tried to force myself to be okay but past experiences caused me to lock up and completely lose myself to jealousy and fear so they quit talking for a bit. She recently reached out to him to explain her blow up and dipping out and he stated how I still just needed some time to get myself better. He's been nothing but understanding and not rushing at all. I reached out to her because I believe them both and I know her and I could be great friends too. I said I wanted to try a group chat to start to ease into things a little and see what happens from there and both are on board. However, I wanted to process for a couple days and make sure I wasn't just doing it for them like I had before so as to avoid issues.

So now I'm constantly at war with myself and my insecurities, and I have a constant need to control situations. And I don't want to. I don't want to live being afraid of letting my guard down and getting blindsided and then thinking I couldn't recover from that. Do you have any tips of ways to ease into relinquishing control in even small situations to build my trust in others and myself and to know that it'll all be okay even if I don't have the reins the whole time?

TL;DR: I have bad past relationship experiences that cause me to be scared to relinquish control of situations because I'm afraid of being hurt again, and mostly afraid of not recovering if I was. I want to make my relationship better and I want my boyfriend to not feel controlled. I want to be friends with people that he's friends with who are interested in a friendship with me too, and not live in a state of fear that if I'm not involved, I'll be forgotten or replaced. Help?

(Unsure if it's helpful, but just wanted to add that I'm on Venlafaxine (generic for Effexor) extended release 150mg for anxiety/depression.

124,"Sorry for my bad english:(

I (22M) have a sexting problem and I hate myself for it.  I occasionally write to women on dating profiles to do sexing with them.  I don't force anyone to do so and stop writing when she doesn't want to.  Sometimes there are women who participate and I really like this at this point.  I then send them nude pictures and this excites me very much when they look at and comment on these pictures.
 Then when I'm done, I hate myself and delete the contact, block the person everywhere because I'm ashamed.  Afterwards I am very sad all day and hate myself for everything I have done.  The next day starts, then the whole thing starts from the beginning.

 I have already made plans to stop several times.  However, the urge to do so is often too great and I do the same again.  I hate myself for this behavior and am sad almost every day.

 What can I do about it?  I want to be a normal 22 year old man.  Why do I have to be so gross?  Why is my psyche so bad?  I want to be like my colleagues. I watch very hardcore pornos with really extreme fetish like asslicking feetlicking, but I dont even like it in real-life. When Im horny I turn into an animal and I cant explain it.

125,"Hi all! First time posting here so hope my post is ok!

I have been signed off work for 10 weeks in total due to a ongoing issue with medication side effects. I am based in the UK. I have major depression and generalised anxiety disorder. I have been prescribed pregabalin which caused me memory loss and confusion (have ceased use) and venlafaxine which caused nightmares every night (have recently ceased use of that too). I cannot be on SSRIs due to awful side effects I had to them many years ago. I am now beginning a Mirtazapine regime (15mg) and I’m extremely concerned about weight gain. Due to my anxiety, I worry I will put on weight. I am currently going to the gym once or twice a week to help with the depression and am tracking everything I eat.

126,"I'm struggling. I'll try to be brief on why I'm struggling... diagnosed GAD years ago, well treated with meds. Had a baby 16 months ago (she's perfect). Husband suffering from severe mental illness (diagnosed with bipolar, depression, OCD, and anxiety, but not certain those are correct) and refusing treatment. I know he's not treating me right and it's 100% because of his illness, and the way I've been feeling/treating him. A month ago my next door neighbor had a mental health crisis, his wife called the cops, kept escalating, SWAT came and he was killed by the police. The front of the house is destroyed. All while me, husband, baby, our 2 cats and 2 dogs were held up in our bedroom on the farthest side of the house. Since that event, my head is FUCKED. I can't think properly, can't focus on work, can't hold a conversation with my husband about anything important. It's just been getting worse and worse. I started therapy again about 3 weeks ago, have seen her twice and have another appointment tomorrow. Saw my psychiatrist last week, he said he didn't want to treat this ""depression"" with meds yet as he thinks it's temporary due to the event next door. Seeing him again in March. I'm losing my shit. All I can think about is cutting myself, although I don't really want to. 

So my dilemma: I feel like I need to check myself into a psych ward, but I'm worried about how that will effect the rest of my life. I'm already struggling to get approved for long term disability insurance due to anxiety and narcolepsy although they were well treated at the time of my application, now I'm struggling I know I'll get denied coverage if I'm admitted for mental health. Not to mention my job. I know I have short term disability and I would still get at least 80% income for 6 weeks I think if I needed that much time off, but then if I do, what do I tell everyone when I get back? ""I lost my mind and checked myself in?"" I have no issues admitting I have anxiety and such, and even talk about it, but right now I'm so far from where I've ever been I just can't even think. Also, what would happen to my family if I were admitted for days, or weeks even? My husband is suffering as well, and due to a med he takes I'm not confident he can be home alone all night with our daughter, only because he absolutely will not wake up to anything for at least 4 hours after he takes this med (prescribed by dr). Not to mention, I do 95% of the work for our pets: taking dogs out, clean up poop, walk dogs, change litter boxes, feed them breakfast, etc. I'm afraid the household in general would be in disarray if I was gone.

Should I ignore all of these issues and check myself in or should I keep trying to push through with regular meetings with my therapist? There's a ton of detail I left out so if you want more info before providing advise please ask.",29Jan2020,1
127,"They refuse to understand everything going on.

I wanted to do my first ever mental health day since my friend passed away in 2016. My dad screamed at the top of his lungs at me to stop being lazy, my mom told me I was just tired because I was up too late, they claimed that because I’m apart of a strong family that I shouldn’t feel this way, and so much more. I ran to my bathroom and bawled my eyes out as I got ready for school.

I tried messaging them. My mom told me “You rock! I love you. Thank you for being strong and going.” I appreciate that because she did tell my dad to tone it down.

But I feel miserable. I confessed how I’m feeling again, the fourth time since my friend passed in 2019. I told them how things get progressively dark each time I feel this way, and that I’m scared if I don’t get help I’ll hurt myself. I’ve always gave them hints that I really do want help because something is not right. I’m undiagnosed, and every time I tell them I want to get help and more support, they divert the topic and just tell me they hate I feel this way.

138,"I’m sorry if this offends actual doctors, but I have been feeling this way for a while.  

Every time I see a psychiatrist, I am forced to see a different psychiatrist than last month because it is a “revolving door” at my local municipal mental health services building. That means that the psychiatrists barely stay. They stay for a month at this location.

And for me, I haven’t been prescribed medication in more than 5 months because they say that they can’t prescribe medicine in good faith as they won’t be able to check on me as the doctor will stop working at the facility. And I have schizoaffective disorder.  I have been inpatient in 5 different behavioral health systems across the state of California. 

All they are interested in giving me are antipsychotics, and they make me feel stupider, slower, cause excessive weight gain, and I suffer extrapyramidal effects such as not being able to open my hand when I take them (depending on the drug). 

I felt that Ativan was helpful, and so did my family on my disorder, but they tell me that Ativan is somehow not safe even though my pupils according to my optometrist no longer open or close normally as a result of the antipsychotics. 

Why is it that these doctors think the antipsychotics are so helpful when they have only caused me woe? In many cases they seem to cause MORE hallucinations and delusions. They cause me more irritation. Yet, when a medicine does seem to be helpful, they take me off it. 

So, I feel like these doctors play games with me. I feel like they get paid oodles of money just to show up to work without doing anything remotely helpful for me. 

I know I’m not the center of the world, but I feel that for a doctor, we patients should actually matter to the doctors, but it feels like we don’t. Or at least I don’t. Maybe other people feel differently about their doctors.

145," 

If this is the wrong place to post this please let me know.

Background: I'm very happy with my current life; GPA, friends, my appearance. I just went through a breakup, but it was on very good and mutual terms that we both needed to work on ourselves individually before either of us get into a relationship with each other or other people. I go to school 10 hours away from home and lean closer to introversion.

As a kid, I was very socially awkward in school but fine around my close friends. In elementary school, I would watch other kids too see how they acted in/out of class. I didn't want anyone to think I was weird so I would make sure that my actions, the way I walked, talked, or even laughed were similar to the kids around me.

Now I am different in the fact that I don't really care how people see me as much, however, I still will sometimes subconsciously wait for someone to talk to me, or make the move on me, or bring up a subject before I do because I am so used to waiting for other people to do things so I know that I am ""allowed"" to laugh or talk about something. I think I do this so I don't have that person get mad at me or out of fear that what I say is something they disagree with.

I noticed this was very prominent throughout my most recent relationship. Although we got intimate very quickly, it took me over a month or two to actually feel comfortable enough to go in and try to kiss her, even while we were alone.

I have a flawed way of thinking where I constantly worry about how my actions are going to affect others. Although this doesn't seem flawed at first glance, something I've done so many times is not the text/call the person I'm dating while they are ""busy"" whether that be with studying for hours and hours straight or while they're at work. I feel bad about bothering them and making them talk to me and therefore harming how much work they can get done or that I'd get them in trouble.

Final points:

I also doubt that some people want to talk to me, or would be excited when I text them. My issue is that I think everyone around me is normal and has all their stuff together at least in comparison to myself. I think that's why I value other people's actions more than my own.

All of this leads to me second-guessing my own opinions because I value other's ideas way above my own. This caused issues in my relationship with me overthinking and doubting things she said because of advice other people gave me. This lead to a lot of miscommunication on my part because I never thought she was going to be thinking about what I was thinking, or that she would completely disagree with it. But I'm doing much better on the idea of accepting if her/someone else doesn't agree with my opinions and I've began to say them regardless.

How can I start to convince myself that not everyone has life figured out?

How can I begin to change my thinking on how my actions/thoughts are not always less important than others?

I'll also add that I have always been shy, improving a lot over the last few years but I know that it plays a big role in how I act.

I'm not sure if this happens to everyone but I often look back at choices I made and laugh and am confused at how obviously wrong what I did was. I don't regret these decisions it just makes me think about why it happens so often.

146,"Hey all,

Cross post from r/ADHD.

I had posted on here with a throwaway before. I’m just feeling a bit confused/disappointed and hoping for some support. After working with my counselor for a few weeks, she recommended I get screened. My previous diagnoses were GAD, then BP NOS, then GAD and Depression.

Today I met with my psych. He prescribed me 10mg of Adderrall to try. I’m grateful because I’ve been struggling to manage my anxiety with my current meds and counseling. So I’m hopeful Adderall will help. Along with the shit storm of my life - disaster house, debt and disorganized bills, lack of career development etc.

I’m feeling a bit disheartened because after chatting my doctor said “So you want to try Adderrall?” And I said yes, if he agrees that he thinks it will help. He said well you have mild symptoms, but you have a job and did well in school. But he has also diagnosed people later in life (I’m 30f).

I guess I fee a bit like he thought I was a drug seeker. Or maybe I don’t have it and am just lazy. I dunno. I thought I’d feel better once I had a diagnosis but I’m just feeling confused.

Has anyone else had a similar experience?

149,"Hi everybody, I created this Reddit account to ask for some advice because today I came to the realization that I feel lonely. 

To start off, I am an 18 years old boy, I live in a big city in the Netherlands and I would say that I am relatively popular. I have more than enough friends that I regularly hang out and party with (so this is not my concern). 

Ever since my teen years, I have been struggling to get a girlfriend. I wouldn't say I'm awkward with girls and a lot of people (even the ones that I don't know that well) would say that I'm quite likable as a guy. I dated multiple girls over these years, but I never really had a relationship. 

I feel like that is the thing I am missing, and every time I fail to establish a proper relationship, I get more and more sentimental to the point that I'm struggling to keep myself from crying in public spaces and at dinner with my parents.

This sounds very stupid and cliché, but really all I want to do is just to hold hands and cuddle to help me fill my emptiness.

Any advice would be appreciated",29Jan2020,1

152,"I saw this therapist towards the end of last year (about October) but how I perceived the session was like she was trying to take the mick out of me. Like she was saying ""how come you don't talk to me? do you have Asperger's?"" and then she went on a random tangent about forgiveness and ""letting shit go in life"".

So I thought that she was just trying to fuck around with me - and on a forum where therapists are reviewed, I left quite a scathing attack on her. nothing defamatory, but then I felt I was disrespected by her.

I went on another forum and I posted similarly, but then, funnily enough, she saw it and I didn't respond since I thought ""fuck it, bitch"".

But then she left a message on a thread saying for me to call her. I was a bit sceptical but then I thought what the hell and did. So then she was saying that she remembered the session, and didn't mean any offence. And that my first response to the review site had cost her business and damaged her. I felt a bit guilty from that point - but then I said to be honest that I thought she was being mean and harsh for no real reason. I can understand if I did something bad to her - but I didn't.

She then said that she was sorry if she offended me since it wasn't her intention and that there were no hard feelings. I think she was shocked at the veracity of my review, but then I'm torn here. At the time, I thought it was fine, but then I guess now I feel guilty. And she said she understood if she was being harsh or hostile, but then she wasn't. I guess she felt it was unjust, and we both got the wrong end of the stick somewhat.

I think it's because, in the past, people used to say shit to me that was random but just to fuck around with me and harass me. And when people do it now, it triggers me.

But was I wrong here? I feel I was.

How would you as therapists handle this case? I'm thinking of asking the review site to remove my initial posting since in hindsight it wasn't warranted.",29Jan2020,1

New research came out about a condition called pellagra that cause psychosis, and how it lowers the body’s ability to use niacin/B3; this condition has been known for awhile by orthomolecular psychiatry to be one out of many underlying conditions that can cause psychosis or schizophrenia. 

Throughout the years I've come across multiple sources stating that Niacin/B3 has the potential to stabilize those experiencing psychosis. One story was how a doctor used niacin on a very unstable psychotic psychiatric patient; he was given whats called a super dose(a large but safe dosage) and promptly fell asleep to awaken in a calm state. I've also seen people state niacin helped them through a ""bad trip"" while on hallucinogens like LSD. So it might have therapeutic potential.

In whats called orthomolecular psychiatry they understand that there are several underlying conditions, like pellagra, that cause psychosis/schizophrenia. Here's a link to an article that lists many underlying conditions that can cause psychosis/schizophrenia, including pellagra: [https://www.alternativementalhealth.com/twenty-nine-medical-causes-of-schizophrenia/](https://www.alternativementalhealth.com/twenty-nine-medical-causes-of-schizophrenia/)

This article goes over the many different conditions and the symptoms that each condition can produce. I've actually made a questionnaire of these conditions and their symptoms in order to narrow down the possible underlying condition causing ones psychosis. You can fill it out and give it to your doctor(physician and/or psychiatrist), and hopefully reach a diagnosis that doesn't require the use of neuroleptics / ""anti-psychotics""

159,"  I have severe social anxiety. Until recently I was almost a complete shut-in. I only went outside for school and depended on other people to buy me clothes groceries and it went on for 5-6 years. I am 18 years old now. Anyway people around me are bullying me. Almost everyone my family is very difficult. My classmates have spat on me and insulted me and even threatened to harm me. After a while I complained to teacher but they said that I was delusional that it was only in my head and that they weren't talking about me and they were only spitting on the floor.Now just to make this clear they were walking right behind me and were spitting countless times while insulting me and kicking the floor. Everybody thinks I am insane and completely incapable of doing anything on my own. Recently I managed to go to the store and even that was a giant step for me. I overheard one of my classmates saying that the girl who worked there almost didn't serve me but the boss was standing right there so she had to. And they said that i should kill myself like my mother did. People on the streets, people who I don't even know look at me strangely. My teachers aren't even trying to even pretend to be nice to me. And i have 0 friends and have a difficult time even going outside. I am very afraid because it almost seems that if I am ever in serious trouble that anybody could harm me and nobody would even care. I am very passive and almost forget all the times they insulted me. But also on the other hand it makes me want to do more and to be tougher, more assertive, to try harder because they already hate me and want me dead so at least I could put some resistance. I feel like I am all alone everybody is against me. What should I do. I really need some advice.",29Jan2020,1
160,"So at school today we were talking about addictions and there was this picture that had many icons, each showing a different form of addition. It had pills and needles, for substances, a ps console for video games etc. It also had a (razor) blade and next to it a drop of blood (they were all black and white) for, well, cutting.

Now, I have been someone that has dealt with cutting/self harm in the past and actually still dealing with it. And I usually don't get really affected by mentions of it, even photos. But seeing it in that context really fucked me up (together with the fact that I felt like my secret is exposed to the whole class). I realised I actually was having a (minor) panic attack. In class.

I shared shaking, going back and forth, feeling dizzy and sick and really wanting to cry (I actually did cry when the bell rang...). Self harm is something that has never made me react in such a way before. But it's only recently (last couple of weeks) that I had come to realise that it can come in the form of an addiction. That it affects you like one. And it does. For me at least. I know that every person can deal with it a different way and be affected by it differently.

173,"Hi, my name is Sam.

I started university in September 2017 after a dreadful experience at sixth form (high school equiv, I think) and starting to develop some dangerous ideas and philosophies of life.

I studied Computer Science for a year achieving 80% in my first year and making some (what I thought were life long friends) and eradicating toxic friends from my life.

I moved in with two of my friends in second year and my mental health began to deteriorate again, worse than during sixth form. I was admitted to the pysc ward after 4-8 suicide attempts (my mind was so blurred and absent I genuinely can't remember). I left university and went back to living with my parents, leaving my university friends.

I slowly became healthier and began looking for a job, and found one, but I knew it wasn't long term. Unfortunately the business went under over Xmas.

Today I had an interview for a new job and was offered the job within the hour. The job is ideal, perfect location, not bad money. But it's not what I wanted to do, at all, it's a mundane 9-5 mon-fri, which is what I vowed never to get myself into.

I need the money, I need the job security and I need to have a reason to leave the house. But on the other hand, I want to achieve something in my life, I want to be happy and I know a 9-5 is not the solution for me.

Accepting this job, to me, is accepting defeat. It is accepting that I did not finish University, that I broke under the pressure of university life and that I am not getting the job I wanted (which uni was required for) and I can't bring myself to do it.

If I don't do it though, I'm letting everyone down. My parents will hate me, it's taken forever to find an ideal job and now I'm tempted to turn it down, in favour of what!?

181,"Hello all,

I’m looking for a bit of information regarding personality disorders relating to having serious hypochondriatic tendencies for seeming attention. 

A family member (F24), from a very young age, has pretended to have dramatic illnesses (cancer, brain tumours she’s had surgery for, broken ribs etc). She’s told teachers and friends at school, having them believe she’s very sick when in fact, she is not. Obviously at a younger age (although not young enough for it to be seemingly innocent or to fit in, we’re talking 15 here) we thought it was a stage or a phase she’d grow out of. She’s always lied and been quite aggressive verbally about being right and has always given off this impression about being better but we though this was just an ugly personality trait she’d grow out of.

Since then she’s dropped out of university 3 times (biomedical science, geography and now nursing) due to illness or grief from friends and family dying (not true, I’m very lucky no family has died recently). She has also gone travelling abroad alone where she kept a blog about how much she hated the normalcy of her family and how she’d never go back because she hated us all because we treated her so badly (not true). The love of her life and 3 friends apparently died while she was travelling, all 4 of which the family have never heard of.

Recently she’s told us all that she’s having issues with her heart and has gone into hospital for major surgery and could die. Im not sure what to think anymore as she’s cried wolf so many times. She’s been in hospital for 3 weeks until yesterday when she discharged herself after the consultant (bless his heart) straight up told her it was all in her head and she was in all cases, fine. I’m hoping that the hospital trip was to, in fact eliminate all physical reasons for her to be there leaving only her mental heath to be the reason for her supposed illness. 

I’d really appreciate any information as to what area of mental health this would fall into and in what way I can help. I’m not sure if it’s my place to say anything at all but if I can help in other ways I’d like to be prepared to know how I and other family members could help.

Thank you",29Jan2020,1

184,"I'm currently 15 and in year 10 of school in the UK i was sitting an English mock exam 2 hours and 15 minutes today and i was doing fine for a while but it was my first time sitting at the front row, the hall i was in has rows from A-P each row has 11 seats, there were 2 empty rows to the left of me,  


While i was in the exam i was writing some paragraphs on the work and as i finished my second one i started to get a headache and start overthinking a lot and it was getting annoying, i rested my head on the desk for what felt like 2 minutes but when i lifted my head a teacher was asking if i was ok, i was shaking still overthinking things and it had been almost 15 minutes, i was really confused and muttered slightly yea ""I've just got a headache"" and she moved me to the back of the hall and of course moving seats  during an exam a lot of people looked at me and it got a bit annoying but people shortly turned back round, i slowly calmed down and got back on with my exam but it frustrated me the entire time through the exam and had a headache for quite a while after, i don't know what happened to me or in general and it got  me really worried and i'm still confused and slightly scared about it right now, i spoke to a friend about it for a bit just explaining what was happening and she said i might have had a small panic attack but i quickly brushed it off explaining that there's no reason why i would  


ive had no history of mental health issues but recently the past month or 2 ive started getting more frequent headaches, when i'm in the car on just in general around my mum if i ever mention anything about others having mental health or others having issues at school she always says that they're just doing it for the attention and that kinds and teenagers cant get stressed there just making it up cause they think its cool, for a while back in primary school when i was around  8 some things in school were bothering me and whenever i was angry at something i'd grunt and stomp my feet but my mum complained saying it scared her and that why would i be angry i'm 8 she has shaped the way i think of myself and others with mental health issues etc and every time i feel like somethings wrong with me i feel like im contemplating i might have said issue for the attention. but today during that exam is the first time anything close to a real issue has happened to me, i haven't and probably wont speak to her about it because she will say the same thing that ""im being silly"" and ""why would you be stressed your a teenager""

185,"I have homicidal thoughts but I’m not ashamed to admit that I have them. I know I’m not a danger to myself or others, but the reason I’m posting here is because it’s become a real nuisance. For starters, I have OCD. What I’ve noticed lately is I’ll get homicidal thoughts at around exactly the same time of day- usually late at night when I’m alone in my house. When I have homicidal thoughts, I feel this deep yearning to get my frustration and anger out there- obviously something I can’t satisfy because you can’t kill people. I won’t be able to sleep or focus on anything else because I’ll be so upset and distraught at this idea of not being able to get my anger out or at least calm down- and then before I know it it’ll be early in the morning. Then I get even more upset and have more homicidal thoughts because I become even more angry since now I know I’ll be tired in the morning. It’s a vicious cycle. Does anyone have any advice for this or how to satisfy this everlasting yearning and anger? Or to at least calm down?

186,"Sorry if this is the wrong place for this, I'll probably post it elsewhere also just in case.

I want to preface this with the fact that I'm always afraid of saying I feel that whenever I talk about my issues, I feel I can't say that it is due to my breakup, as it sounds cliche and I feel people will say that I just need to get on with it and move on as it is normal. This is why I can't ask about this in real life. I am 19 years old.

We were only together for just under a year but we were best friends beforehand and at the start it was perfect, we were best friends and in a relationship.

But then due to my own actions due to my mental health issues, it went wrong. I had always experienced depression before, to the extent for most of my late school career I didn't have any proper friends and only went out a couple of times in the 4 years of upper school (UK). If relevant, I believe this is due to me moving school pretty much every year/other year between year 4-10  (10-16 years old).

Due to this when we met I felt ""good"" for the first time in my life. Someone wanted me around and we'd spend hours in the park, just huddled together in the freezing cold and talking. Even though I hated school, my family, most people and my life in general, I finally was ok.

Then I completed my A levels and I was finally free of school and was ready to start my life, hopefully with her. But during the summer break, I had my first mental breakdown when she went away for 2 weeks with her friends. I had experienced them before but was completely unprepared for the level I felt this time. I couldn't breathe and I just wanted out of my head. So I drank and ended up sending her regrettable messages and ruined one of her nights.

Things were uneasy for a bit after that, but we got on and moved past it. After all, she hadn't experienced it in real life and honestly I think it was largely played off as a drunk episode. The rest of the Summer was fine other than a festival we went to, which put me far out of my comfort zone but I was excited to challenge myself. I acted like an idiot and probably made her have a worse time than without me, but I dont think I ruined it and I believe she understood what it was like for me (I passed out from heatstroke multiple times on top of it).

Other than that it was fine for summer. She went off to uni and I was fine, the problems with separation were not as rampant. Then she had an anxiety attack and asked me to come up, which I did. I believe I made her feel safe and she made me happy. I stayed with her for a couple weeks before coming back down, but was invited to a party up there and went back within a week. I then stayed for a while. She then suggested that I should just get a place up there and spend the year, which I did (largely to get away from an abusive family). We were happy (she suggested living together the next year when I went to uni and would call me ""husband"" and stuff).

Then it went wrong. I heard rumours that she was planning on cheating on me with a guy from back home, apparently inviting him up (which she admitted to doing, although without the cheating part) or when she went back down at a party. From here it got worse, I was in a bad, anxiety fueled mood whenever I'd meet up with her and we'd generally get past it but she just got fed up of me.

There's many more details for stuff I did wrong, but I changed. I was a different person and so, obviously, she fell out of love with me. We were in an uneasy relationship for a bit but could still hang with eachother. 

Then we both went down for Christmas. Just before the party she had been rumoured to plan on cheating on me at, she broke up with me over discord (talking app). I was broken because I knew what that meant but I kept it in for a bit.

When we came back up, I was determined to stay friends as we still were good as that, but that obviously was the wrong choice and it turned sour, my fault, fast.

Now it's been a month, I barely have contact with her and apparently she's fwb with the guy she was rumoured to go and cheat on me with. Any ""friends"" I had are all from her uni and know both of us, so I can't talk to them. I can't talk to my family as they are horrible. I am completely alone, I have tried to meet people through tinder and have looked for groups online but I can't find anyone. I can't find a job and I am constantly battling depression and anxiety to the point of wanting to die.

I have a future ahead of me and I just need to get through it. But I miss her so much and it's hard knowing I ruined the 1 good thing in my life just because I'm me. Any advice would be appreciated.

P.S: I have tried the NHS but they refused any medication due to my age (19) and it is taking a very long time to get into their mental health program.

TL;DR: No friends, very depressed with severe anxiety. Lost my girlfriend and the only person I've ever cared about due to mental health. NHS abandoned me, can't go back to family. Completely alone and not sure how to go on.",29Jan2020,1
187,"I wanted to share my story about a toxic workplace. I hope we can change the actions of people and businesses in the creative field.

In the end I was let go for no reason, which resulted in me lawyering up (I won that battle). But after all was said and done, I was drained and battered.

188,"This seemed like the most appropriate subreddit for me to post this in. 

Anyway, I'm 18 and I feel like I've been in a funk for about 5 years now. It began when I was about 13, I began to develop an eating disorder, but at the time I labelled it as me being ""healthy"". I was basically in denial of it but everyone around me could tell. I thought I was genuinely happy, but there were things going on with my life that a 13 year old shouldn't have to deal with. My eating habits were the only thing I had control of in my life I guess you could say. I did well in school, I did well in sports. Up until I was about 15/16. I began to feel unhappy for no apparent reason. I began losing motivation for things I loved to do, I started losing interest and motivation for school which resulted in my good grades to drop, A LOT. It was to the point where one of my teachers pulled up my previous marks and said ""what happened?"". Pretty discouraging, right? A few months later, I began to develop anxiety (diagnosed), which came and destroyed every possible good thing left in my life. It took me to the hospital a few times as well. It really took me down. Not only did it do that, but I then developed social anxiety. I was scared of going out in public and being judged. I would sweat going out in public. I felt like I had no control of anything, I felt so destructive to everyone around me, so I thought the best thing to do was distance myself from others. I started to feel like a burden to others. Like I wasn't wanted. I didn't know how to be happy anymore. 

In present time, I feel the same but worse. I literally feel like I have this huge weight on my chest filled with sadness that just won't go away. Even when I think about it, as of now I don't really have anything to be upset about in my life but I still constantly have this feeling. A couple of years ago, taking my life was on my mind as I felt like I couldn't get rid of this feeling, like I wasn't good enough. I don't suffer with these thoughts anymore as far as I know. But I do get extremely intrusive thoughts almost everyday and they really bother me, it's like self torture almost. I don't even know what to do at this point. I have motivation for nothing and I just can't feel happy for anything anymore. I can't even focus on a task for 5 minutes. I use anything to feel some sort of ""rush"". I've turned to weed to get some sort of happiness and numbness. But I do not rely on it, I just want to point that out. But, exam season has just passed, a friend of mine gave me Ritalin to help me study. I know this is totally not okay at all, I'm very aware. I've taken it a few times and every time I've taken it, it just completely calms me down and I feel at peace. I'm able to find focus, I feel happy. It doesn't make me go crazy hyper or anything, it's just nice. I am also NOT reliant on Ritalin either, I've taken it 4 times within the past 2 almost 3 years. 

I just don't know what to do. I try and bring this conversation up to both my doctor and mom but they both kinda just let it by and brush it off as nothing. I don't want to feel sad for no reason. Is this a feeling I'm supposed to live with forever?",29Jan2020,1

I’m now suffering with a bunch of mental issues. I’m a sexual abuse survivor, I’ve never spoken to anyone about that, and I’ve never dealt with it. I have anxiety that comes and goes, where I feel like I don’t fit in anywhere. I find meeting new people extremely stressful to the point it makes me physically ill.

I don’t go out much because being around people is very hard for me. I’m lucky enough to be financially supported by my husband, but I want to have a career of my own. I don’t see how I can do that without a lot of help.

198,"Mental health got the better of me for about 4 months last year, I was at the lowest place I thought I'd ever see myself, I didnt care about anything I just wanted to die. I always suffered from anxiety and depressed thoughts but I could control my mind, but recently I couldnt, I started self harming, planning how I could die, writing suicidal notes, quit my job, drinking from the minute I woke up till I passed out, because at this stage it was the only thing getting me through each day, taken the pain away, feeling I could be myself, give me a bit of a “buzz"" but one bottle of vodka wasnt enough to help the pain, started doing drugs, started praying alot, going to the chruch, begging for answers I couldnt do it alone, apologising to god for all my sins, I'm human I'm not perfect, but nothing it still wasnt helping.
I felt like this was my life, I'm going to turn into an alcoholic, no goals, no motivation, lost contact with the majority of people I used to talk to simply because I felt helpless, nobody would understand why I was this way I couldnt understand myself. I hated myself my mind had gone to a bad place. No need for me being here, I couldnt cope
One day I decided to plan on how I'm going to end it all that night. I was in a graveyard, balling my eyes out, shaking, feeling sick, absolutely broken. Just wondering WHY. I was sitting there and a Robin came so close to me for a few minutes, was just hovering around the area I was. I walked back to a friends apartment and went straight into their room, lied there in the dark, crying, listening to music, while my eyes were closed I felt these white feather hovering above me, i felt I could touch them but I couldnt, i seen my nannys face who i was very close to but she suddenly died in 2017. I honestly thought i was losing my mind, nothing could get worse.
I decided to get help, I didnt want to be like that, surely there was a professional that's trained to guide me, i went to a doctor, where I was diagnosed with BPD, having that, anxiety and depression was not easy. I didnt know who I was. she referred me to a mental health nurse, I felt stupid, at first I was like fine whatever I'll go, I had no motivation to better myself, I started going, stopped drinking so much, I started to do things for myself, telling myself I am worth something, I can succeed, I was giving tablets, started off with 50mg and then 100mg but honestly I didnt want to relying on drugs to better myself. So I fought with myself.

I did go through alot, alot for me, might not be alot for anyone else, alot of close relations to me either died or got sick, broke up with my boyfriend who I thought I'd see the rest of my life with, it was a very toxic relationship but I couldnt see that. Every day was a battle.
I'm still here. If this part of my story can help anyone I'd be so glad. What I've realised after struggling them last 4 months is to better yourself because nobody else will, I didnt take my meds because I wanted to prove to myself that I am STRONG. Talking to a friend, writing down thoughts, get them off your chest and out of your mind, nobody will judge you, dont be negative, everyone turned their back on me where I was at my lowest because I was negative thinking things wouldnt get better
But here I am now. I'm still alive. I'm happy. Appreciate everything. You are you're only medication, live for today and be thankful for what you have, give yourself goals and TRY your best to reach them life is to short to live in regret because one day it will be over.
For anyone reading this, who's suffering from mental health issues, you are loved, you are worth something, be positive, you can be the best. I'm only 20 and I wanted to die. I still am 20 and i want to be better then who i was, not everyday is easy but i appreciate been able to think for myself and breath without a pain in my chest.

199,"I don’t know what to do. 

I’ve been having a really hard time lately. I don’t know how to explain myself.

Two months ago I started a new position (1 year fixed term) at my current workplace. Since then, I’ve worked three 6-day weeks, one of them resulting in me working 7 days in a row (Tuesday to next Monday), and I feel like it’s really worn me. I used to be adored by everyone in the team who thought I was so ‘helpful and sweet’, but lately I’ve been so short tempered and impatient, with spontaneous bursts of rage that I can’t really control.

My boss is a very efficient person and an excellent businessman. He’s nice to people upfront, and behind their backs he will talk bad about them. Recently I heard from a trusted colleague that he has also been talking bad about me for something I didn’t even think I was wrong to do. I don’t feel like I’m valued and appreciated at my work, a few empty words of ‘thank you so much’ isn’t really that inspiring when he goes on his phone and talks to his friends while the rest of the team are dying away under all the busyness. I understand that he’s the ‘boss’ and we’re getting paid to work, but he’s expecting everything to be done when he’s not setting an example? He’s not inspiring the staff to work any harder. Is it really called delegating efficiently if you’re playing on your phone while other people are working???

Yesterday was supposed to be my day off, but my colleague asked me a few weeks in advance to cover for half a day since he needed to attend some important family matters and I had agreed. Which is fine. But yesterday morning was so busy. After it finally died down a bit I received a message from my manager saying he needed a certain thing done NOW. And I just exploded. Couldn’t really remember what I actually did but apparently I threw something, cried, and my colleague had to sit me down in the staff room where I sobbed for another 10 minutes.

Later last night, my boss called me to ask how I was doing. But his main message was to tell me to find a way to manage my stress better because it’s very obvious when I’m stressed and this affects the team, that while the team can ‘help me manage’ they still need to work, so I need to be professional so everyone can work well. I don’t really know what to think about this. If your employee breaks down due to overworking and the stress of everything, is this the advice they should get? I guess it is good advice, and I do need to find a way of managing my stress, but I’m honestly so overworked and whose fault is that? I asked my close colleague friends and one of them said ‘at least you got tomorrow off’, and another said he agreed with the manager, that ‘while the current employer may be willing to help you, other employers may not be so willing’. WHAT AM I BEING HELPED WITH??? He just wants me to do homework on controlling my emotions so everything goes smoothly at work. He gave me no recommendations on what to do, just told me ‘we need to work on this’. What’s ‘we’? I’ve never felt a ‘we’ from him. I feel like he honestly doesn’t care about my wellbeing, it’s never his fault, and everything just has to be perfect for him. 

They’re all trying to tell me to change. Stop saying yes to working on your day off, learn to meditate, find a hobby, don’t stress so much. I made a list of things I’m stressed about today and there’s 23 things. These are the people I’m working with. Are they that annoyed with me that they want me to change everything? Is it unacceptable then for me to accept my current self? They’re all telling me to improve, but it’s not for my wellbeing, it’s for their own convenience so they don’t have to work with the me in a bad mood. But we’ve worked together for years and they know I wasn’t like this before, I was nice before, I was patient and kind all the time. I thought we were colleagues who became friends. And now that I’m not, now that I’m really going through a tough time, they just tell me to go meditate.

206,"So recently I noticed that I love and enjoy being hated. For past few years ive been extremely antisocial in person. I have many reasons for it, disappointment in friends and family etc...but wanting to be hated this much? It's so weird. I believe it is bc of my traumas but what can this be and how can I get rid of it. I love myself the most in this world so far and my ex (who was the only person who cared about me and loved me) but sadly need to deal with other ppl now for job etc and I always make others hate me in person. Im deep down the nicest, most caring, loyal person but cant show it in person and do everything that makes ppl hate me and I enjoy that (Id hate myself too if I were in their place tbh). This is not normal eh :/",29Jan2020,1
207,"Hi r/mentalhealth

I've recently noticed that I start feeling anxious/sick/tired after spending time with people, whom I love. Staying overnight at my girlfriend is great, but if I stay two nights in a row I start feeling weird, like anxious and almost dizzy at times. I love my girlfriend to death and we have a great relationship, so I doubt it's anything to do with her, but I can't figure out what to call it/what it is called. I don't think the social anxiety title fits me well either cause I'm fine in social situations, albeit abit nervous with new people. Please help me find out what my problem is :/",29Jan2020,1
208,"My depression feels unbeatable. I take mood stabilizers as instructed and go to therapy once a week. I live life pretty moderately. I do some exercise and eat decently. My life consists of school, friends, and interests in fashion. I’ve been struggling it feels like my whole life with it. Now I’m having depression episodes of breaking anything and everything, screaming, crying, and intense thoughts of suicide. I don’t think I have any will to carry out the deed. I’m  petrified because I don’t know if I’ll ever feel content or comfortable. I try so hard every day to practice mindfulness and things to relax the mind, but it seems to pull me deeper. The pain I feel is intense. It feels like a thick sludge of the worst thoughts you can imagine. I’ll take advice, but it’s hard to do so. I’m considering partial hospitalization for 5 days. I’m afraid doing this will butcher my relationships with friends, family and school. I did a 72 hour hold about a year ago and it was extremely traumatic. I guess I’m posting this just to see if I get a response. My family and friends are just as hurt and confused as I am. I know they try to support me as much as I try to feel better.",29Jan2020,1
209,"It’s not something I’ve done in at least 4-5 years, but I just started therapy and we have kind of been going through my past. It’s been hard to open up about everything because I’m shy and have kept most of my issues to myself my whole life. But I’m wondering if telling her this would be important or necessary to get the most out of my treatment. If so, how should I even go about brining it up?",29Jan2020,1
210,"So I calmed down now. I made a rambling post earlier. I was molested a few times when I was 12/13 by a family friend. I’m 18 now. It left me with depression, anxiety and really low self confidence. I recently told my mom because my mental health got so bad. I guess she made a police report. I got a phone call today from the pd in the town that it happened in. I only told them that it did happen in that town and the individual doesn’t live there anymore. When asked about who it was I said I don’t recall. They knew the guys name from my mom and I said I didn’t know the name. He is the head of the board of a local college. Would it even be worth proceeding? It is most likely just going to be my word against his unless his sons testify against him and I’m not really sure if they saw anything or could even remember it. I also wouldn’t want it to be a big thing in the media since he’s the head of the board at a local college. I don’t really like the cops either since one killed a kid down the road from me and I’ve never met an understandable one. So basically should I proceed or just let it go and stick with therapy?",29Jan2020,1

213,I have had depression for years but here I sit at the brink again. Nearly a year ago I started to have obsessive dark thoughts and my anxiety ran away and so did my depression which lead to being hospitalized for two months after a phychotic break. Since then I've sat here recovering and have more control of mind and have brand new life perspectives that have given me a reason to live. The man I love who has got me through this loves me so much yet I feel dulled and incapable of giving love at this time yet I know I love him. Now feel like my depression is worsening again and my thoughts are becoming louder. So I'm scared. Maybe if I acknowledge here I'm unwell it will help in some way. Because I've been told get a job or go back to the country I come from. How did people integrate back into society?,29Jan2020,1

215,"Don't know if this is the right place to post this but lately I've had really strong suicidal thoughts more than usual for no reason at all and have been zoning out alot, I've been scared to see people to the point where it's made me physically sick. I feel there is something wrong like there are a few wires in my brain that are damaged. Would just like to know if anyone else has felt this way before?",29Jan2020,1
216,"Ever since I can remember I haven't had the sense of belonging despite my efforts to for like, I'm at uni and great group of friends all 39 of us get along we chat we chill we hang out but it's not like having a best friend. 
I do belong in my uni but my track record of studying hasn't been great often due illness beyond my control or triggering events. 
Even on the internet I have lots of places to visit but its like midfield and feels really superficial, I miss that real connection to close female friend, I used to get that with a male friend (when we were dating) but when I split up with him he's stopped wanting to text me and doesn't feel excited to see me anymore and I'm feeling that's heading for splitsville and they something that I would find difficult so I try overly please him. I would stick by his rules, let him win arguments, etc let him sit and watch crap on telly.  I wanna watch something meaningful given that I work hard as student social worker.
Giving that when I hit dark placs with BPD it really matters.  He has such a relaxed attitude, doesn't like being grown-up, acts like he's 7 and I'm used to be adult and I'm 11 years younger.
So I often feel like I have to be parent and tell him grow up a bit, take responsibility, take garbage out and put up with learning disabled flat mate getting drunk, guess whose picking the pieces it's me.
His flat doesn't understand what the difference between a bottle of Pepsi max vs bottle of vodka, let alone a credit card is and he's nearly 60. 
I feel like I'm the social worker already and I need my own chill zone too.

He doesn’t understand what abandonment feels like for me, so if he's p made plans for me tells me short notice i’m justifiably more pissed off than most people.
I'm often looking forward to catching up with him, but telling me the night before doesn't give me any time arrange other stuff to do apart from usual Netflix and ain't in the mood at all to be thinking joining local communities clubs s these have triggered the abandonment issues to start with. 
People messed me around, friends messed me around from day one, I ain't going go some lame support club as might as well stare at a wall all day.. It makes me feel nuts inside.
I ain't support club it's let's talk meaningless shit, weather, grocery shop runs you name it, price of carrier bags, traffic. I was expecting to be placed where serious topics are chatted about as well as gaming, music 🎶 arts, tv shows etc and not bloody weather is cold.
So I gave up on that idea and plus I'm tired I just wanna go and see a friend and chill, chat have fun and not be scrolling through Reddit and FB because He's watching crapsons for 1000000th billionth time or saying the same sense of humor child like

I feel this could go deeper",29Jan2020,1
