I have some close family near where I live now but just a cousin who I haven’t spent much time with in the new city which is some 700 miles away. I have no friends in the new city save some internet folks I follow but I have a secure job set up and a plan for school. 

I am a natural born procrastinator and am unsurprisingly prone to severe anxiety in times of change like this. Right now I can feel myself shutting down and am so so worried about getting this apartment rid of things I’m not taking with me and generally getting it clean. I know I have enough time in theory but in reality I feel like every little thing is taking too long and that I’m gonna fuck this up somehow. I don’t know what the point of this post is just wanted to see if anyone else has gone through something similar rn.

I am very much starting on my life and getting things done finally but I’m mostly alone and I’m so so scared",18Feb2020,1

This happened this valentine's day.
I'm struggling with continously relaying the incident in my head and realizing I almost died. I have been repeatedly telling people i love them, I was never an emotionally open person. I've been struggling with disassociating as well. Ive not accepted fully what's happened and I am all over the place mentally but not crying or saddened. Just scared. 

I want to talk to a professional once I am able to move off bedrest. Until then how can I cope?",18Feb2020,1
2,"First, ignore my username, it was made a year or so ago when I was falling apart. 

I'm a 19 year old male who's past few years and present have been plagued with mental health issues. My mental health problems began to creep in lightly around the start of grade 9, and gradually got worse with each year with them drastically starting to get worse towards the end of high school. They got so bad to the point where around this time last year (2019 Jan-Feb) I would begin to physically beat myself and would leave noticeable bruises. *This was triggered by me not knowing what I wanted to become in the future, by not knowing what I liked or why I actually never enjoyed anything. Those two things were enough for my self hatred to take over myself in massive amounts. During these moments, I always got so fed up with myself for being born as me, and would ask myself ""why me? why couldn't I just be someone else?"" The inferiority  I sensed in myself when compared to others was just more fuel to the fire. This lead the self hatred to boil over and get me so frustrated and upset with myself that I would end up beating myself and leaving bruises out of shear self hatred.* 

&amp;#x200B;

I have friends that I would talk to  (and still do) when things would go south, they would help, but after a while the negative mental state would creep right back in. 

For the rest of 2019, I was a mess. my mental state was polluted and the urge to self harm was frequent but nothing rampant. So much despair to the point that I thought suicide may actually be on the timeline of my short lived existence.  I was constantly stressed out, frustrated and angry at myself for being what I was. Mid-2019, I decided, I needed a job for the time being rather than just sitting around in despair. I applied to a job I had my eye on and got called to the interview, I felt happy, having a job meant my own money, a new computer I could build and more. Long story short I got the job, and was pumped for my first day but also nervous. Seems normal. As the days went on, I realized I really liked working, the people were great, the pace was nice you name it. But I also discovered something else unfortunate regarding my mental health. I would be working, and out of the blue, a thought would pop into my mind, a thought that would cause my mental state to become a wasteland. ""But what are you going to do in the future?"" This caused a feeling that I hate, the feeling of everything going well and being fairly happy and then all of that just gets taken away in seconds - replaced by despair, stress and self hatred. It doesn't help that I never really have been all that good in school anyways despite me always trying my best no matter how much I hated the course, the outcome would be the same even back then too - which would only further my sense of inferiority. This seem out of order right? How I went from me working right to my performance in high school? Yep, that's about the best I can put anybody reading this, into my shoes in those moments. It changes in a snap,  just like  my mental state. 

But I discovered something else too and I guess it always was discovered by me but now solidified. If I made a mistake, that regardless of the size, I would find it incredibly difficult to forgive myself for it. If I was doing well at something and made a mistake, it destroys my confidence for future rounds of that same task making me question myself. Further enforcing the sense of inferiority I have in myself furthering my self hatred as well. 

Coming close to the end of 2019, the bad mental state from earlier that year was creeping back for the same reason. And come 2020, it 100% returned. The feelings of inferiority, confusion and being lost about what to become, polluting my mental state into become a wasteland had returned. This time I didn't beat myself but more so just lived in stress for the next few weeks. I had trouble sleeping, I was a mess at work and couldn't focus on anything, hell I found a game that I really wanted to play because I found it interesting and I couldn't even properly enjoy that because my mind would always be a mess from that one question on what to become. 

One late night, I decided, enough is enough.  I was tired of being pushed around by my mental health problems, tired that I could NEVER focus on anything or enjoy things I genuinely wanted to do. I got out a sheet of paper, and began listing down my mental health problems and things that I think need work. I IMMEDIATELY, felt better.  Like a weight was taken off. 

That list of problems: 

Overthinking (in progress)

Beating up myself over every mistake no matter how small (in progress) 

Severe self comparison to my peers around me frequently

Very harsh self critic that needs to be tamed

Letting other peoples opinions guide my life, decisions and enjoyment in things I may like 

Caring too much about what other people think

Can rarely accept compliments

Can't find peace with myself 

Resentfulness

Self Hatred

(Will add to this list the more problems I discover)

Fairly long list, but one that I have begun progress on. Problem by problem, before I proceed with my life, I want find a fix to them and understand why I feel like that and possibly avoid a lethal end. In fact, I feel like the problem with over thinking has already got a bit better since beginning to address it, I can recognize when I'm over thinking and cancel out the thought with persistence and actually pretty quickly too - but I feel like it needs some work still as it could be better. Due to this my performance at work has also increased to the point of people complimenting me frequently on how efficiently I work since I can put my full attention into a given task. Another thing I discovered at work a few weeks ago, was that I still can excel at something I don't like doing and that the satisfaction of doing it correctly would be enough to make up the deficit for me not liking the task beforehand, which set some tones for me and made me feel a bit more confident. 

My urge to self harm reduced from mid 2019 to now. I am able to control my actions towards myself and actually have not beat myself in months. 

Today I boiled over once more, but not in the bad way, I gained enough confidence to tell myself I was gonna fuck up each one of those problems sooner or later. That I was coming for them. That they have no control or right to possess me in the way they do in almost a daily basis. No longer are they going to keep me from doing things I want to achieve, enjoy or affect a positive mental state.

I just wanted to vent somewhere where I won't be judged. And no, I won't tell anyone Irl about any of this.

7,"Somedays, I’m not sure how to help myself. I feel inadequate. I feel like a burden to my loved ones and boyfriend, because I’m constantly under so much stress from training to go into the emergency responder field (which is like very rigid military style training).
I seem to have a difficult time dealing with this stress, whether it be blocking it out, my inability to realize it, or cutting myself off from everyone and having depressive episodes. And I feel awful...my poor family and boyfriend, having to deal with me, subjecting them to my troubles and my strife. I feel like I drain them and burden them...and I don’t want to do that at all.


But I don’t know how to be decent anymore.
I don’t feel happy anymore. Im constantly anxious and depressed and I have trouble doing simple things. I can feel myself half-assing my way through everyday. I’m not confident in myself anymore and it feels as if my intelligence has dropped significantly. I can’t think clearly or comprehend things easily. It’s hard for me to grasp certain concepts. I feel like I always have a brain fog, even when I’m perfectly hydrated and have gotten enough sleep. I feel stupid and slow. 
In addition, my emotions have been all over the place...it’s hard to know what will and what won’t set me off anymore.


I don’t know what’s happening to me, but I can feel myself rotting from the inside-out. I feel like I’m deteriorating and falling apart. I never used to be like this. The worst part is that I don’t know why it’s happening or how to fix it.
I’m not sure how to get the help I need...and for some reason I’m apprehensive about it, but I do want to get better. I just want to do the right thing. I just want to be happy and comfortable with myself again.


And sometimes I wonder if it’s from my ADHD (which for me, causes a LOT of anxiety and/or depression), my PTSD, or the several concussions I’ve had within the past year that are affecting my head. Or maybe if I had grown up differently, in a better environment that wasn’t so fucked up, maybe I could have been a better person.

But that doesn’t matter, because I can’t really fix those things.

I need help. I want to be myself again. 

I want to be happy again.


P.s. If anyone could share their mental health tips/coping mechanisms/resources (I’m from the US) I would greatly appreciate it. And for those who may ask, yes, I have made a future appointment with my therapist and will be going weekly. This is just something I’ve been feeling for weeks and I really just needed to get it out somewhere.
So...thank you. To anyone that read this. I appreciate you.",18Feb2020,1
8,"This is a weird post, but I really need this off my chest. I’ve hated myself for my entire life, and it’s getting to the point where I think there is a deeper reason to why. Many friends have helped me, and I have genuinely tried to love myself but nothing works. I’ll explain some more. I genuinely feel like the ugliest person in the world, every single facial feature I have is wrong, no matter how small, I can’t even look in the mirror anymore because I’ll just break down into tears. I have cut out most of my friends, avoid my boyfriend, and avoid talking to people, because I feel like they would be embarrassed of talking to someone just as ugly as me. People have told me that I’m pretty in the past, but I know they are lying. They’re just saying it for some personal gain. I genuinely want to live an isolated life because I don’t want to burden people, they would be ashamed of me, and how ugly I am. And I have been through a lot of changes, I’ve lost a lot of weight, gained a lot of weight, but no matter what I seem to do I will never be good enough. I am not perfect, and everything about me is wrong. I’m trying to save up for a lot of plastic surgery, and trying to workout again, but avoid my friends, social gatherings and my boyfriend at all costs, they deserve prettier friends.

10,"I work with my father, and I'm trying to understand his behavior. A very uncomfortable scenario played out today.

\~

In passing, I began a conversation with a co-worker. My father saw us, and said ""hey dream, come over here"".

I walk over. ""Yes?""

""I need you two to stop messing around.""

""Um, ok."" I feel my skin begin to flush. I'm uncomfortable.

""Now don't get offended"" (I'm not offended) ""I just see you two over there. I see you two over at the machine talking.""

I start to involuntarily defend myself a bit. ""Well, I thought we were pretty good with staying on task..I..""

""You're fine, it's him, I need him to focus. You're over there working, he's not. I need you to step up and leave him alone.""

""Uhh....ok, yeah.""

\~

As I walk away I think, wait... why am I being talking to alone, especially if ""he's the problem""? Why weren't we both? In a moment of courage (I usually do not express these sort of things), I decided to express this thought because i thought it was a fair.

I head back over. I calmly ask if he plans to talk to Co-worker too, as I felt it made sense to talk to both of us. He gets very visibly upset, and says ""I'm not having this conversation"".

His demeanor is extremely cold to me after this.

Fine. Whatever. I just feel glad that I expressed my thought.

I make sure to not mingle with Co-worker. I do take his request seriously, and I want him to know that.

Near the end of the day, the inevitable retaliation begins.

\~

I am attempting to write this as close to the real conversation as possible.

\~

He calls me over.

Father: ""When I'm trying to tell you something I don't appreciate you to coming back to tell me \[references earlier\]""

OP: ""I just didn't get why if it's both of us causing an issue, and most especially Co-worker as you said, why I'm individually being talked to. I felt a bit singled out.""

I am *enormously* uncomfortable at this moment.

F: ""You're not being singled out. You know you're not being singled out. I'm just trying to tell you something.""

OP: ""And I hear you. I'm not opposed to what you said. I just wanted to express how I felt.""

F: ""When I tell you something I don't except you to tell me how you feel about it, I expect you to man up, and say OK.""

OP: ""I was, but I think I should be able to ask questions too?""

F: ""You can.....""

OP: ""But....you just said that's what you didn't want me doing?""

F: ""Ok, that's not what I said. You know what..."" Starts to walk away.

I walk after him.

OP: ""Didn't you just say when you tell me something, you don't want me to have a response, you just want me to say OK.""

F: ""I expect a little more out of you, yes.""

OP: ""That's where I'm confused...I was just telling you how I felt""

F: ""And that's all I'm doing.""

I'm having difficult keeping up with the conversation at this point.

OP: ""What?""

F: ""I'm just trying to tell you how I feel too.""

OP: ""Ok, I want you to do that.""

F: ""Ok.""

(awkward pause)

OP: ""I'm confused...""

F: ""You're telling me how you feel, and I'm telling you how I feel""

He smiles after saying this. And my brain is melting at this point.

OP: ""Ok?""

F: ""Ok.""

17,"Hello, so first a little about me i guess. I'm 16 male, i'm from Australia. Lately, increasingly in the last 6 months to a year. I have been getting extremely lazy, it's getting to the point where it's affecting my life now. There are a few big things that it's affecting badly that i need to change NOW!!!

So the first and the biggest, I'm studying web design through what we call TAFE. i think it's like college for Americans. Anyway, i'm so lazy to the point where i don't do any of the work, i wake up in the morning when my alarm goes off, but i just go back to sleep. I say i'm too tired or i'll get it done the next day. I'm skipping classes too. See i live with my dad and he goes to work really early so there isn't any way for him to know i'm not going. Right now, as i type this out, i'm supposed to be in class. However i'm sitting at my desk in my bedroom in my pajamas typing this out on my computer. I was supposed to go yesterday too but instead i slept until  1 PM then played video games all afternoon. See the problem??

Second issue is my personal hygiene and the sorts, i might brush my teeth once a week. Not because i don't remember, i do, i think about doing it every night. I'm just so lazy i just go to sleep anyway without brushing them. Same with showering, sometimes i'll just skip showering because i can't be bothered to walk up the stairs to have a shower. Other times i wont even eat. I've gone entire days without eating because i simply can't be bothered to make something. I'd rather just sit there and play video games or watch YouTube. 

I have basically no life, i dropped out of school because i was too lazy and could never find the motivation to go and do it. So i just ended up failing all my subjects because i watched Netflix in class all the time. So i spend my days sleeping, playing video games and browsing the internet. I honestly think i might be addicted to the internet at this point, i always want to be on the internet and when i'm not using it i'm cranky and i am thinking about using it. Which i have read are signs of addiction. But i can't help myself. All i want to do with my life is lay in bed and play video games or browse social media. I'm honestly content with just doing that. But i can't just do that.

I'm really angry at myself because i let this control my life and the laziness is so strong all i ever want to do is use my computer. I put off so many important things and i'm putting my life on the line by doing it. I just need some help, but i don't know where to start.",18Feb2020,1

There’s smaller hills like Luke and Matthew. I feel like I’m flowing through the individual points of the landscape, like a 3D geometry with different topographies. Called it hubs and bands, energy transferring data or information between all the vertices or points of the landscape, and it doesn’t stop at the borders of my brain, I figured out those borders only exist on one zoom level and if you go up or down they disappear. So thoughts are just flowing into everything and everyone around me. It gets very obvious. The organization takes advantage of this and uses the devil to channel it.

Past couple nights I’ve heard very loud sounds outside my window and I was sure it was them, and they were on the roof coming to break into my window. I was frozen with fear at first but I thought to myself I’m not dying tonight just because I was too afraid to do anything. I got a weapon and sat staring at the window prepared to make sure I got the first move and take them by surprise for a long time but they didn’t ever come in. I think they are messing with me. All doctors seem to be involved with it too, including my therapist. I don’t want to see anymore because I can’t trust her but it is a lot to deal with without talking to someone about it. I will be testing her at our next session and figuring out if she is a part of it. If she is I’m dropping her and just staying the hell away from “mental health” services. I know for a fact the doctors are involved with it already, so it’s most likely that she is too. I recognize this all looks exactly like paranoid delusion but I know for a fact this is going on, in fact they are using that whole thing as a “plot device”. Making me hear voices and hallucinate and act like a schizophrenic is exactly what the devil does. I didn’t even know that before, when I researched it I found out it does that. I don’t know entirely my goal posting here I just wanted to vent about my situation since I don’t have anyone to talk to about it and can’t trust my therapist. Thank you",18Feb2020,1
33,"My wife asked me if I had a personality disorder last night, I guess because I talk to myself a lot and my behaviors and especially my emotions can change a lot. I also still sleep walk as an adult... I think I’m pretty stable, so I said “no, of course not”, but I’ve started thinking about how my sense of self operates and for me it works like this: I have different emotional sets that have accompanying vibes: soldier, junkie, detective, doctor.... many more, but they all have an emotional range of what I can feel for the day or time that I occupy them, like  as a soldier I can’t feel the same level of sadness as if I was occupying a different set like a doctor. There’s a scale of emotions that each have access too. It’s like archetypes I’m operating from, but I’m aware of it, sometimes I use these consciously to get a job done, but many times I just let it play out how it’ll play out, but I do know which I occupy by the accompanying images that go in my mind. Along with these archetypes I do have body dysmorphia( sometimes I feel really fat, or thin, tall or short, ugly or beautiful) and there can be distortions in my perception of self. I can do everything to anyone if I’m sufficiently motivated. I know a lot of people say they couldn’t kill or hurt a child or dig thru sewage. Which I’ve always considered social posturing and I’ve always thought anybody can do anything, they just pretend that they can’t to make others feel better about them. I’m pretty much able to turn empathy/morality/disgust on and off like a light switch. I know I’m not a psychopath, because I feel really deep empathy when I want to and that’s my natural state. I also don’t have a good pain sense anymore, somethings that should hurt a lot don’t,( cuts that need stitches, twisted ankles)  and somethings that shouldn’t hurt at all, freak me out and I’ll think I have a broken bone when I don’t, or a broken tooth..... Anyways, do most people operate like this? Am I just mildly autistic like I’ve always thought of myself?",18Feb2020,1
34,"For as long as I can remember everything I do has been reduced into pure strategy in my head. I’m very clever. I’ve sorted out how a lot of this works. I get away with lying because I have realistic lies and reasonable excuses, and I’m cautious. I can call attention to myself in a way that doesn’t make me look like an attention whore. I pretend I do it on accident.

Worse still is that I get pleasure from making other people feel uncomfortable or like they messed up. It makes me feel like I have control, because I always feel like I’m messing up somehow and I don’t want to be alone.

37,"I doubt anyone will even read this, I've never done anything like this before so I guess this is just a rant. I'm a 28 year old male who works in a blue collar field and is struggling to get to the point where I feel financially stable (since I'll be happy THEN.... right?...) I have a young son (under 10) that I had in a one night stand. I'm active in his life i.e. I pay child support, pick him up every weekend that's mine, play with him, take him to see family etc. I struggle to make and maintain social relationships. (I make friends easily but I dont ever maintain contact) I have 1 or 2 real ""friends"" but I've just severed one of those friendships over something trivial as fuck.. 

I think about killing myself almost every single day. Just idle thoughts. I've only actually almost did it once. (When I thought I wouldn't get the job that I have now.. ((which pays my rent now and not much else)).) I find my thoughts drifting off when I'm not doing anything. To putting a gun in my mouth or hanging myself. 

The only reason I didnt kill myself before is because when I was about to do it, I saw my sons shirt folded over a chair where I was (stupid I know) and I thought of how it would have fucked him up. 

So I'm not at active risk (that moment was enough to pull it out of my mind as an actual option) but i just sit and think about it a lot.

I do risky shit that I cant reason with myself as to the justifications.. I impulsively do drugs when I shouldnt (drug tests at work, I'd be fired and no way to pay rent) I have sex with complete strangers that I'm not even remotely attracted to. I've lost interests in my hobbies and I dont socialize at all anymore, unless I'm fucked up drunk (which is becoming a worse and worse person to be around, so I just drink alone mostly... almost every night) 

Idk what the fuck this is about, I just feel like blurting shit out for people to read.. and I didnt think much about what I decided to write. It's too much to cohesively explain I guess idk.

It's been a couple years since it started, but I've felt my emotions all dull to a point where I've become comfortable with it, and become anxious when they present themselves in a more prominent way. If I ever feel any love, it's barely there. It's not just my girlfriend, but my family, and friends too. I dont know why I am this way, but I really hate it.

53,"I just feel like the whole ""mental health crisis"" has been so horribly manipulated in society (coming from america atleast). Alot of people are suffering because of bad economy, loneliness, and an unsteady future. All things caused by the way our society is fundamentally run, but as soon as people start talking about solutions to rising accounts of depression and the likes, it's all about new SSRI'S or too much screen time or whatever BS they can come up with. (Dont get me wrong medication does work for some people) 
Its literally because corporations dont want you to feel good just so that they can trick you into buying more for the illusion of happiness, and to keep you obedient in your minimum wage job. 
The best thing you can do is be part of a community, preferably in person I'd say, but even this is a community. One where you can talk freely and you help people and theres the exchange and working togetherness that has made people survive for hundreds of years. The thing is that we can make a change as a community but not as individuals, which I think applies to mental health aswell. 
If you have been told that you need to fix your mental health alone and it's only your work that can change it I think that's wrong. It's normal to have some level of dependence on other people, and to need things from them, even as an adult. You deserve to be loved and feel comfortable BEFORE you can start healing.

57,"I thought I was over it but apparently I’m not. I was in a relationship last year with someone who insisted that he was bisexual. After we’d been dating for a few months and we’d physically been intimate three times (which I did because I felt love, I don’t usually do hookups I’m too emotional) he told me my body was gross. My parts were gross and that I would always come “second” to men in terms of beauty and sex appeal. I broke up with him. I spent a lot of time working on myself and healing. I’m not upset with him being what is (I suspect) a gay man in denial. I just felt absolutely destroyed when he picked apart my body and compared me to three other males. I’m female. 

Then, recently I just started dating a new guy after talking for awhile. He is so much nicer and lovely. We are meshing really well. Flirty, fun. We confessed feelings and started dating He also identifies as bi. I’m fine with this. I am too . I just happen to keep running into people who are? I guess it’s my circles. But recently I’ve been increasingly anxious and tonight my anxiety is just peaking. I’ve noticed on his tumblr and stuff he never reboots women or m/f bi stuff. Just gay m/m. I’m getting paranoid this will be a repeat. 

We talked about intimacy before and he told me he’s inexperienced but insisted he was attracted to me. I told him about the last guy and what he did. I even have screenshots of my current bf telling me what he did was terrible. But I am so afraid I am not good enough or not the type of person he would want in that way. 

I feel this way because I creeped his blog tonight and he reblogged something about fucking a guy. I’ve sent him a few dirty/cheeky snaps over the past week (testing the waters) and he just called me cute. I... am very nervous and my anxiety is out of control. I am crying. I’m so scared. I just have some body issues and I just want to be desired. I don’t know how to bring it up because he keeps deflecting any mild flirtation that is sexual. Or being “polite”. I just want to know he wants me. we don’t have to do anything yet, I just want that affirmation I guess.

I’m realizing I’m traumatized from being picked apart. I remember my libido was so shot. But it’s back and I want to have that connection with my new bf. I feel like just putting this on the table will be weird.

I went to her upstairs bathroom because I thought I was gonna throw up and I was over the trash can almost dry heaving, my mouth was producing so much saliva I was spitting it into the toilet. Since then it has gotten worse and has started happening when I’m around her and it‘s so bad that I get nauseas right away.

64,"Silence greeted me. Not of the sort that draws one in and embraces in its bosom or lulls one into intoxicating lethargy; neither that, that follows the rush of air and curt whine of hinges fastened to a door swiftly shut on the trials of an arduous day. I was greeted with the song of malice. A numbing silence bred of disgust, malcontent, and icy disdain. The sort of vacuous void that trots on the heels of an eruption of venom.

I stood stunned, paralyzed by the absence of cohesion in my mind. My thoughts had been dashed; cast into the abyss as if they were struck by a thunderous gale. I blinked. I shuffled my vision and focused on the front door, the hammerblow of its closure still reverberating in my skull. 

""Wothless"", ""fucking piece of shit"", ""deadbeat"", ""you're the fucking reason why"". 

I didn't feel anything for what seemed like hours. I stood peering into the door. Perhaps through it. Maybe in an attempt to reconstruct the events that just collided and left me reeling in the dusty aftermath of discord that followed.

A blur of motion swam before my eyes as I staggered to a nearby chair. The peeling tick of my bare feet on the linoleum floor echoed and coalesced as I slumped. 

And then I made my descent. The world around me made its evacuation, fleeing from the darkness enveloping me. The light emitting from the dank apartment rose, it wavered, and then it was gone. A candle caught in a gust.

My throat closed and I could feel the wounds in my chest for the first time. Thin lacerations, each no more wide than the breadth of a hair descended in a wave through my torso. Each one intersecting in a lattice through my heart. The last of the light poured forth.

I jerked as if strung on a marionette. Through the void I could hear the distant pattering of my own feet on the linoleum floor. I felt the bite of cold steel saturate my hands. 

I felt a wall thud against me from behind and the strings gave slack. I crashed to the floor and the lines went taught at my arms. The kiss of cool metal met my lips and the taste of iron flooded my senses.

My thoughts came racing back to the fore as if beckoned forth by the icy touch. The strings tightened and the darkness smothered me as if sensing the challenge to their rule. 

I heard laughter then. Not of malice, or of madness. But the sweet song of innocent joy. The giggle of a child's glee. 

The strings gave free, receding back to the void. The silence replaced by the calming melody of my steady heart. The light returned, blurred through tears. 

I peeled my eyes open and blinked to clear my vision. 

I was alone. Sitting against the wall. My sons clumsily discarded shirt dangling from the corner of a chair before my eyes. The pistol from the drawer came to rest on the floor beside me.",18Feb2020,1

It's more than that. And it's not with the intent to cause suffering, because like I stated, I do it for the emotional pleasure it gives me. Behaviours such as starvation, sleep deprivation and other forms of dysfunctional living gives me a great deal of pleasure.

I'm wondering if this kind of thing has a clinical term that I could use to familiarise myself with it. My therapist brought up non-sexual masochism, but from my understanding, masochism is also about the enjoyment of one's own helplessness, whilst I feel very powerful when I engage in such behaviours.

honestly the only reason i still want to live is for my family, but i just feel like giving up on trying in life (like school, etc) ive lost motivation for so much that i just feel like a failure and i dont know how to stop it. everyone says i have to be more confident in myself and stuff like that, but i just cant have a single good thought about myself and i just thrive off validation from other people. i just dont know how to combat these emotions without working to reframe my whole way of thinking.

does anyone have tips on getting through school with no friends and with no motivation to do anything anymore?",18Feb2020,1

71,"Weird question.... Sometimes I feel crazy. I feel like my whole life there's been something off about me and nobody will tell me. 

My life is 100% normal - great job, I perform extremely well, make great money, have normal &amp; good friends, get along with literally everyone. Great family life etc... I see a therapist weekly due to job stress, life stress, past trauma, and just wanting to generally be the best person I can be and maintain a quality life. I am very sensitive, especially at work and thrive on acceptance from others (which i naturally do not constantly get, but it does affect my mood when I'm not), and I get very irritated with people that I don't mesh super well with - yet I hide my emotions insanely well and nobody would ever know. I've been told many times by bosses when I lose it and quit a job that they had no idea how irritated I was. However I always way over think it and try to make a rational decision, and only ever leave when I have something better lined up. (Currently going through exactly this).

I recently quit drinking (also part of therapy), so I've just been thinking a lot. I assume my therapist would tell me if something were standing out as off about me, right? 

I had a crazy nightmare last night that I was screaming at my family because they were having an intervention with me tell me there's something wrong with me they've always known about and I couldn't get it across to them that I'm fine. Anyways, sometimes I just feel like I'm in a cloud of messy-brain-ness that I can't get out of. Maybe that's part of removing alcohol from my life too, I've heard that happens..

Would love opinons, and I'll likely share all of this with my therapist next week anyways. Thank you!",18Feb2020,1
72,"Ever since I turned 18 I have had reoccurring feelings of sadness.  It’s mostly due to my lack of friends who I hang out with outside of obligations like school and work.

I’ll be going soon, but now I’m going crazy because I spend everyday at home.  I am not allowed to see some friend from college and it’s a little vexing.  I am also losing interest in things that were fun like videogames.  I seem to get jealous when my one friend brings up thing I can’t do and probably can’t do in the future in college.  Right now when I return she will keeping a close eye on me while I commute to college.  I am also jealous when watching streamers on YouTube having better lives than me.

74,"So.... I don't really know where to begin. I think most of this is gunna rely on a Q&amp;A in the comments to figure this out. 

Hey, I'm a 22yo male living in Ontario Canada, and I think I may be a sociopath or something similar.

I don't believe I'm a full blow 'throw people under the bus for my personal gain' sociopath because I do care about people genuinely and I feel a lot of emotion. I have noticed though that I match a lot of the traits and my life has been pretty damaged because of it. 

So, luckily for me I think I have a pretty good moral compass thankfully as these behaviors I'm experiencing would be SO much worse if not. I'm going to do my best to list as much as I can off the top of my head, behaviors I think are signs of it but then also add a personal counter to it.

1. I am very easy to irritate and after that, very easy to anger. But im selective with this, for instance, Video Games, super easy to set me off. At home arguments, also easy, but with strangers or friends? I'm calm and collected, and I'm never prone to violence, even if im thinking about it, i never react that way.
2. I will purposely neglect tasks in order to shove them off onto someone else. But I feel bad doing it a lot of the time an know its wrong but 99% of the time I still follow through and even when im called out on it, I don't change (GF telling me off for neglecting chores for instance)
3. I feel a lack of empathy/sympathy most of the time. I do experience it genuinely but not often, but in cases such as a friend has a breakup, I don't feel that bad for them but I will comfort them and offer advice to the point where it looks like im being sympathetic but I often feel as if I'm doing it to make my friends like me more rather than actually caring about how they feel, even though I actually do care. (IK its confusing and hard to explain, Its like I care but I don't at the same time...)
4. I'm extremely impulsive, especially with money. I spent my $9k school grant in 2 months. 'Nuff said there, cant even back this one up, I'm just really bad with my money and I don't realize how far I've gone till I'm broke again. 
5. I ignore my GF unintentionally, I know I have to give her love and affection and attention but instead I sit on my ass playing games and I often totally forget to spend time with her or acknowledge her, even when she directly asks for attention, I'll promise her attention but then it slips my mind and I keep playing games. I know she needs it and I truly want to make her happy but my mind just throws the idea out the window and totally forgets, same with doing things that would make her life better. I want to do it, I just genuinely forget and I feel bad.
6. Continuation of the last one. When my GF does get mad or frustrated with me, or anyone in general (usually due to me forgetting to do something for them) I tune them out and don't respond, I'm listening to them but I'm not there, y'know? I hear the words but they don't mean anything to me. Its almost like, ""Welp they are mad now so there's nothing I can do now, so just shut down and wait for them to finish"" and I think that's partially why I don't learn from my mistakes. 
7. The only time I start to listen is when there is a life changing risk on the line, say for instance my GF has had it and threatens to leave me, then ill start actually actively caring and will do well just to bring it back from the brink of break-up but once the dust settles I'm back to my shitty antics. Same goes with the workplace, but they are typically less forgiving, thus I've been fired from quite a few places, usually due to arriving late numerous times.
8. Small point, but I think it counts. I drive pretty recklessly, I'm almost always speeding not by much but I'm often 10-20km above the limit. I don't swerve around or bob through traffic, but I just little care, I text and drive a lot also. But then I also criticize other drivers for being bad drivers and driving recklessly.
9. When called out on mistakes by someone who doesn't know me well such as supervisors or acquaintances, or if there is room to lie to soften the blow or get out of trouble, I will often lie. But will not usually lie if it means it will harm someone else, like I will own up to a mistake rather than show the punishment onto someone else (but maybe cause that would increase the chances of getting caught in the lie, but also cause I don't like throwing people under the bus). Even on small things, I don't wanna take the heat so i'll lie, knowing that if I get away with it i'll be off the hook but if I get caught lying the consequences will be 10x worse.
10. As mentioned earlier, I'm irresponsible, I've been fired from a few jobs for being late constantly, and I constantly neglect household chores and responsibilities, even if I'm aware of the consequences of neglecting them, and in the case of the chores, sometimes I just straight up forget about them, but constantly. 
11. I'm very selfish and I often don't realize till I'm called out on it, just in general. Trivial stuff like getting someone a drink when i go to the store to get one or lending money to a friend is not an issue, I don't mind doing that stuff. It's more-so the total absence of mind in some situations causing me to totally forget to do things for people like mentioned earlier. For instance, a while back my GF had a really hard day at work and when she came home and complained about it, I still expected her to make dinner. Like WHAT? what was I thinking? After I realized that was a really stupid thing to do, but her being the best, actually did make food, although being very pissed off at me for good reason. 

So that's about all I can think of right now but I assure you there is more. The one thing turning me away from believing I'm a sociopath is that all the sources I've seen talk about how they don't show remorse and don't really actually care about anyone other than themselves but that's not true for me. I love, and care for many people around me, I'm just unfortunately pron to neglecting them sometimes, but I also have the opposite for some people sometimes where I cling to them and wanna be around them all the time. I genuinely love my GF and my friends and care about their well-being also. 

I don't really know what I'm looking for posting this here, Confirmation? Knowledge? I know I wanna bring this up to my counselor and doctor but I also don't wanna walk in and open up the sociopath can just to find out im just an idiot and have something else or embarrass myself someway. I think its good that I'm self-aware that I have an issue though, no matter what it is, at least im not blissfully ignorant, thinking everything is fine while everyone around me suffers. 

Most importantly I need to know how to be normal, I want to be a good BF for my GF and lately I've not been, she is pissed at me and I need to take the initiative and stop acting so selfish but I don't know how, whatever is making me act the way I do is hardwired into me and idk how to stop it.

77,"Hey everyone.

For the past 2 years, i’ve started getting some extreme nostalgia. It can be debilitating, and really wrecks me emotionally.

I was known as a really happy, energetic kid when I was young, and I was truly happy. But now, as a 19 year old teenager, I feel sucked. Life lost all the magic it once had. It’s dry. The best I can do is make everything feel okay on certain days. Nothing is sparked, and I feel I have completely changed as a person. 

I will get extremely vivid flashbacks to myself when I was 4 or 6, completely random memories. Sleeping at grandmas house, 8th birthday, old play dates, and they ruin me. I break down when I’m alone often. I know other people speak of nostalgia, but I have found no one can relate to what I experience.

78,"I'm going to start by saying I am not diagnosed but due to my constant physical symptoms (racing heart, always out of breath, constant sweating, headache, etc) and terrible insecure and intrusive thoughts that it's pretty clear I have some type of anxiety. I did therapy for a while (triggered by another, more serious reason) and spoke about my anxiety which helped for a little bit. However, our insurance only covered a certain amount of sessions and after that, we would have to pay for it ourselves so I stopped going. Therapy helped a little but my fears always came back, so I started thinking of other ways to help myself because I'm not exactly willing to spill all my fears and insecurities onto my parents. The only thing that helps temporarily and is quick and reliable is that breathing technique all over the internet.

To start with, I'm a very rational person but my fears are so great that it controls my decisions and most of the time prevents me from talking, even to my parents or close friends. This is just a long-winded way of saying I don't actually know how to help myself. I thought about suggesting meds but that would require me not only confronting my parents about it (who don't like taking meds if they don't have to and think that meds for MI change you and it's better without) but also getting diagnosed and I'm not sure they want to believe I may have an actual MI and not just some social anxiety. I also have too much insecurity about my own conclusions, so I can't just say it, you know?

That being said, I would appreciate any suggestions on how to deal with anxiety.",18Feb2020,1

80,"I’ve always strugged maintaining a healthy relationship with food. I was diagnosed with a disorder seventh grade. Even after months of steady recovery, the thoughts never really go away.

I was doing good for a good amount of time. I stopped counting, started eating well, and began accepting my true self. I was content with myself for the majority of 2019.

However, I’ve found myself slipping back into old habits. I’ve started to feel much more self conscious about what I eat and how I appear to others. I’ve been feeling very sidetracked lately. I logged into my calorie tracking app for the first time in months yesterday. Definitely not something I’m proud of.


Despite the excessive mindfulness of meal times, I don’t believe this slip up is revolving around weight. I don’t have a need to lose any more pounds or look any differently. I’m fairly certain this time is centered around a sudden desire for control. Things have been spiraling recently and keeping track of what I eat has kept my mind occupied. It’s distracted me from the trauma I’m too afraid to work through.

 I know that love is the only thing that will ever have a chance of stopping it, but I grow ever more fearful that it's already become too late.  The darkness has grown so strong and consumed so much already that what do I even have left to give?

The first time I picked up a bottle of pills, and paced back and forth for awhile before I set them back down. The other time was in a parking ramp (really high up) and I rested my arms against the railing and thought to myself how I could easily jump it and end it. I’ve self harmed in the past and the urges do come back every now and then. However, when I did SH it was never an attempt to kill myself. I never cut deep enough.

88,"I know it’s a really broad title but overall I just can’t stand being around most people. Some people I automatically look at and hate them. I’ve been treated like trash by so many people so maybe that’s why I’m cynical and automatically assume someone I lay eyes on is a scumbag. The other night at subway this couple kept yapping on and on about some issue they were having with their friend and it was extremely irritating since all I wanted was peace and quiet. I didn’t confront or attack the guy even though I wanted to but when I was done with my food and drink as I threw them in the trash bin I noticeably threw it down hard and as I left the subway I said “Jesus fucking Christ this is BS!!” fairly loud before I left. 

Prior to this happening I had a couple of bad nights out. One night it was mostly positive because I danced with a lot of women and got a couple of their snapchats. But then a couple of situations almost set me off. First this one guy who I gave a ride to had this girl with him I gave a ride to also, she ended up saying something rude af behind my back that I’m glad he told me about. She said I’m “a bad dancer” and I’m like wtf I’m not a country bumpkin I’ve never even 2 stepped before how are you gonna diss me for not being an expert. Hell even most of the women I danced with hardly danced 2 step and they didn’t give a fuck that I didn’t know how to at first. When he had told me she said that I was like well I’m not giving her a ride back, tell her she can find another ride because that’s some rude and disrespectful bs. Oh and even another one of his female friends called me “short” lmao like that’s dumb af. I’m 5’10, you gotta be retarded or some bs to not know the difference between average height and “short”. I danced with mostly tall women though and they didn’t care about me being the same height and slightly shorter than some of them. He tried to convince me not to get mad at that woman and give her a ride back anyway and kept putting his hand on my shoulder. I grabbed his wrist and squeezed it kinda hard and he got the message then and shut his mouth. 

Then a couple nights later I go out again but to a different club scene. Was out with different friends and had fun being around them overall but I had no success with any of the women I approached. I thought I had success with one but after I got her Snapchat she left me on read and never added me back, so I might just block her so it’s over with. Oh and then the other 2 snapchats I got they never added me back either... So overall I basically had literally no success both nights out.

I’m really keen to work, and get stuck in, but everyday i just walk around with nothing to do because everyone has every excuse to not let me work with them. i’m afraid of being fired, and i know the general opinion of me is very negative.

I don't really feel like myself at the moment. I'm not looking forward to next month for fear of another death. I feel immense guilt for not checking up on them more often. This doesn't feel normal, almost like a curse.

96,"**Background:**

To begin, there are many ways I am very fortunate. My family is reasonably wealthy. My relative family is middle class, but both my grandparents are rich. One grandfather is a retired doctor, and the other a retired CEO. I also am lucky to be a resident of Hawaii. My grandparents support us by loans, and occasionally direct payments.

I moved so much as a child. My family has lived in 15 homes so far since I was born. I am 21. So I've lived at each home for only about 1 1/2 years.

I was born a vegetarian. My father is vegan, and the rest of my family and I are mostly vegan. By intermediate school this was devastating. I attended a middle school mostly populated by Marine brats. Military and vegetarianism are extremely contrasting forces. Seventh grade was a happy year of my life. But eighth grade I was tormented for being vegetarian.

My beliefs about vegetarianism caused me to think I had a hormonal imbalance. Specifically, I was worried my high consumption of soy products worried me. Soy products were my family's main source of protein, and soy products are also high in phytoestrogen (female hormones). This made me believe that my moods and thoughts were the same that women would experience. It also made me hypersensitive about my body image.

I wanted to be an omnivore at the start of high school. Buy my parents forbade it. So I started being an omnivore between my Junior and Senior years.

I used to be highly social as a child. I also was very addicted to video games from early Elementary School to one year ago. But I started to not have any friends or acquaintances by the Sophomore year of high school. My only friends were my online cohort: an even mix of previous real life and internet friends.

I was always a very good student. I tested at the college level reading during Elementary and Middle school, I scored at the top one percent of SAT testers, and my GPA was nearly a 4.0 before I was concussed before my Senior year.

I am yet to be part of a romantic relationship. The closest I got to being part of one was a relationship lasting a week with a girl at a Summer music camp.

I think it is possible I am autistic. My friends often call me that, and I excel greatly at Math and Music. I've never been formally diagnosed with autism.

My brother is Schizoaffective (a vaguer version of Schizophrenia). My mother has dealt with Psychotic Depression before.

**TLDR:** My brother's crazy and I though my hormonal balance was off until about a few years ago. Now I know I'm straight. I'm probably autistic too. My family can't stay at one house. We've also suffered from low income previously.

**What I want to talk about:**

I can't stand society or life. It's so stupid. I want to kill myself almost daily. I try to be Christian but my family contrasts too much so I basically need to choose one or the other: living with my family or being Christian.

The worlds surely going to end so why even try? AI or Global Warming are certainly going to kill us within the near future.

What the heck are humans thinking continuing to live the way we are living!? We should be downgrading. A return to archaic farm life and the destruction of factories, cars and planes are a must if we want to survive!

I can't have children, live a normal life, or have a family because I can't put another human through the misery I've experienced! I believe this is the root cause of my mental illness!

I spent 3 months this past year paid full time to live at a military psych ward! Because I couldn't stand retarded and terrible humans at boot camp! I am psychotic and hear voices occasionally!

I am Christian at heart and not a bad person! The closest person to a friend I met recently was a bipolar guy at the Military psych ward.

I can't stand this reality we are all living! we are living through screens instead of reality!

I can't stand Hawaii because it's too diverse. At some level humans are animals, and animals often choose to live by groups of their own color. Hawaii's WAY too diverse. It is the most diverse state by far. I lived for half a year in Massachusetts. At first it was horrifyingly non diverse and I hated it for that! But by the end of the year I could not imagine moving. I loved MA. Yet I needed to move anyway!

Yesterday I nearly hung myself! I set up a noose with a belt around my ceiling fan and wrapped it around my neck! I can't wait to die! All I used to live for was videogames, and orchestra music occasionally. I haven't played or watched videogames for over a year now! And I don't like orchestra music much!

I am insanely overwhelmed at what adult life is like! I don't have a driver's license and I can't earn one because my parents think I'm too crazy to drive!

So I need to walk about 5 miles with 50 pound groceries once a week!

I don't understand how other people can just live normal lives!

I agree with a quote from the crazy prisoner Golic from Alien 3: ""In an insane world, a sane man must appear insane.""

My dad bullies me almost daily. He is the worse human on the planet. He once fought with a group of pot dealers because he and a friend tried to steal pot from them. He smoked pot throughout high school. He abuses me and the rest of the family. He doesn't make that much money either. He's not religious.

**TLDR:** I am probably insane. Suicidal idealization is something I experience daily. My dad abuses me. Everyone abuses me. I can't stand life.",18Feb2020,1
97,"**Explanation**: Self worth issues are quite common, and are mostly caused by personalising the insults and attacks from others, and falsely believing that they are objective truths about ourselves, whereas they are really the projections from those who have been hurt and wounded themselves. Beneath their suffering is really a cry for help.

I am a 17 year old dude from The Netherlands and i love grunge/punk music but i am having trouble finding the right friends who also like grunge or just alternative stuff.

I never leave the house in fear that someone I know will see me. I only take online college classes, which is also to save on gas money, but this plays a big factor as well.

About half a year ago I got a compliment and I was able to look at myself for about a month, a couple times not even minding it. That's the only thing I've found has helped me so far.

I have trouble showering too. I know it's gross but I only do it once a week or once a couple weeks, not like I go out anyway. There's a built in mirror in my bathroom and it's impossible not to see myself when showering.

As stated in my last post, I also have a problem with hitting myself and seeing myself can often result in me punching myself.

101,"I've had two fairly recent crises, after the first one I was placed under the care of the professional in question. I had another crisis, I told the crisis team I didn't want to go back to this person as he doesn't seem to care nor want to help, they said they'd take note but ultimately it's out of their hands. Which I do understand. Unfortunately I was put under his care again.

If I'm lucky, they will contact me once a month by phone call. I've told them my antidepressants aren't working - nothing has come of it. I've said that I'm not sure about my diagnosis of BPD (known as EUPD here in the UK), after looking at all of the resources they gave me and that fell on deaf ears.

I'm not sure what to do at this point, I feel my mental health starting to slip and I've not got a support network that I can rely on to make sure it doesn't get worse.

103,"Hi!

I'm a girl (17 soon to be 18). I live in a small town where nothing really exciting happens. My father died 2 years ago from an accident at home, connected with his prolonged alcoholism and because of that my mom sometimes has emotional breakdowns and cries. She blames herself for what happened and has severe depression and panic attacks which were diagnosed before I was born and my father had depression too he was even suicidal. 

My problems began when I started high school at the age of 14/15. On my first day, I had a nervous breakdown in front of my new class because I was afraid that nobody would like me or want to talk to me and they probably thought that I was weird. So yeah I didn't really connect to anyone there and I guess I still don't. The first few weeks I was constantly crying, had stress dreams every night and couldn't bear to go to school without a pill to calm me down. Anyway, I continued on trying to make some friends which didn't happen. I spent the next two years completely friendless, I stayed home did my homework listened to music and slept. My parents were arguing a lot which they had been doing since I was little. I was always afraid or crying.

Then I became a 10th grader things got better I reconciled with an old friend of mine from my class who I had hurt years ago by choosing another friend over her (this so-called friend did the same to me later). This old friend is friends with almost everyone from the class and she is cheerful and lively and beautiful... just everything that I'm not. Then I started going out with her company and it was pretty cool she started changing though. She said I was her best friend but she didn't show it much. Then I got a boyfriend and we drifted apart even more. Now I don't know if we are friends or not (we never really talked in school just sometimes went home together).

I managed to find friends from my class but they seem to have other closer friends to hang out with and I just feel excluded and isolated. They all try to be liked by the popular ones from my class. 

I'm just confused and tired of everything. I don't know what I want in the future I haven't decided on a profession I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. I've been having breakdowns a lot, moments when I cry, scream and just want everything to end. My whole body shivers and my heart beats very fast and there are these thought like I'm about to die and I just feel like I can't breathe.

108,"Is it normal to be start climbing out and then fall back into the pits? Anyone else go through this? How long were you in this spot?

I've struggled with anxiety and depression for many years and only started therapy 4 months ago. My counselor referred me to the school psychiatrist to help speed up my recovery process. 

I'm in my last sem of college and I don't know if I'll have access to mental health services afterwards. Which I do worry about because ""what if I'm still not better by graduation?"". (I struggle a lot with the ""what if"" scenarios. Been working on it with the ""what's the worst that can happen? What is likely"" which has been working for me).

I started takings an antidepressant in mid Jan along with a sleep aid. The first week on these meds was amazing. I was finally able to sleep. 

This is now week 4 and I feel down and have an overwhelming ""I don't care"" type of mentality. The sleep aid isn't quite working for me anymore either.

I don’t know how to express these thoughts I have, I feel like my suicidal ideation isn’t justified and because of that I’m scared to speak to anyone about that part of my mental health in case I get shunned.

I see it as a selfish thing, the fact that I’m feeling the way I am and thinking these things when people have it far worse and have valid reasons for experiencing these things. But again I just don’t have a good reason, I come from a middle class family, good upbringing, no trauma in life, parents didn’t divorce, in law school and doing reasonably well etc etc. Nothing in my life has stood out as a moment that caused these feelings and because of that I’m genuinely afraid to talk about them, because In theory I have no right to feel the way I do.

111,"sunday night I tried to commit suicide. I took a lot of pills and was brought to the hospital by the ambulance. I had to stay there for 1 night. the next day the hospital psychiatrist came and talked to me. he said he would leave it to the crisis centre (it's like the first aid for mental problems) and that they would most definitely send me to a mental hospital. it may sound weird but this is what I want. I cant stay at home anymore because I'm a danger to myself. 

once we got home we got the call from the crisis centre. they said they were not going to send me to a mental hospital. they offered me to have an appointment tomorrow (so today) to talk about how we can prevent this in the future. I had a major mental break down and got really violent. the police came because I wanted to stab myself with a knife. and also the ambulance. they stayed for over an hour and then left because there wasn't really anything they could do. my mom called the crisis centre again to explain that I was getting out of hand again. their answer was: if your daughter tries to kill herself again, put her under a hot shower and tell her everything is going to be okay. I was again so upset that my mother had to medicate me.

today i have the appointment at the crisis centre. I don't know what's going to happen. but yesterday on the phone they said the appointment will be about how I can get though the days and how to prevent this from happening again. the thing is, it's too late for that. the chances of me trying to kill myself again are 100%. but they dont take me seriously and dont want to help me. 

I don't know what to do anymore... and my parents dont know either. the situation is too dangerous and i cant stay home. my mom is now trying to get a lawyer and if nothing helps to go to the media. 

I'm posting this here because I hope someone can give me soms advise. maybe there is something ky parents and I can do that we haven't thought of. 

also some extra information: I am 20 years old, female and live in the Netherlands. I was sexually abused for almost a decade as a child, my parents divorced, I was bullied for also almost a decade at school and I have autism which we didnt know for 17 years, which resulted in me being treated very badly at home (not because they weren't good parents, because they are the best, but because they didnt know how to treat me). as a result I have severe ptsd, depression and anxiety. and as I stated before I have autism. I cant work, cant go to school, cant do sports or other hobbies and almost never had friends. at this moment I have one girl I can sort of call a friend and u have a boyfriend. so I'm not completely alone and very thankful for that. 

I'm in the beginning fase of being treated for my trauma. I know I'm in good hand and I will have very intensive therapy. so I'm not looking for therapy. I'm looking for a place to go where I am safe, I cant stay home anymore. 

I hope someone can help me or give me some tips to get me on the right track to recovery.

So, starting off, I'd like to outline my situation. I'm the only child, son of truly wonderful parents who have always been truly supportive and caring people. I do have some real friends - people who never let me down and offered support whenever I needed it. I also tend to excel at almost all of the school subjects (not my opinion really, just based upon my grades).  


Yet, here comes my greatest trouble - I always stress myself the hell out before any test, quiz or any kind of activity which might lead to me receiving grade at school. I study a lot, spend most of my free time devoted to subject books but not only does it not help with stress but actually only makes me more anxious.  
 I really would love to find a way to relieve myself of that stress. I have been trying physical exercises, yet they only work for the time being - during exercising I feel really proud of myself and enjoy it, but as soon as I finish, tide of negativity storms my mind again. I also used to paint and draw a lot, as well as read various books, not connected with school at all, but during the school year, I can't force myself to do these activities because my mind can't stop thinking about assignments I have to do or tests I have to take soon.

130,"So 5 years ago I was walking my dog around the local lake late one night after a 12hr work day. I was tired, in a rather low state of mind all around and just felt entirely stagnant in my life.

Towards the end of our usual route around the water there's a wooden footbridge you have to cross to return to the entrance which leads in to the supermarket carpark, as we were crossing this bridge I see what I straight away say to be a young girl thrashing around about 50m from the bridge and water's edge. 

I didn't even think about it, I quickly tied Tazz, my dog, to the bridges fence climbed over and jumped in and swam to her as fast as I possibly could and helped her out. 

When I reached solid ground with her again I remember just deflating for awhile as she explained how she thought she wanted to die till the moment she was in the water and how she couldn't swim. She promised me she would receive treatment. 

It gave me another outlook too, and really pushed me towards a career change and the positive changes in my life that resulted in my son, living in America for two years and other things.

I returned to England late last November around my 24th birthday and this morning decided to visit the pub I always used to frequent with my brother as a younger man, ordered at the bar and sat down to wait on my pint and breakfast.

Who else would walk over to serve me my food? Her, still looking the same though a little older. A beautiful young woman now of 20 years old. The recognition was instant, and she sat and spoke to me for awhile as I drank waiting on my food. She was telling me about how she's thinking of attending university to study neurological science, I told her about my current fight with my ex wife to see my son. How I'd had thoughts of suicide these past few months, recently thought I'd found love again to yesterday have it tore from me at the time I was most in need of her...

After I left I attended my work appointments as usual, interviews, did a bit of writing and then skipped lunch and took the afternoon off (I'm self employed) to ponder the conversation and how after everything I went full circle and she may have just saved my life after all these years. The way I once did hers.",18Feb2020,1

135," 

Here's my contribution to raising mental health awareness, let's start with a wee anecdotal tale.

There's things that people have control of as an individual with regards to those around them and things they don't.

Some of the major things that can influence people's mental health are finances/debt, grief/trauma/loss, illness, homelessness and social connections/loneliness/isolation. The one you are most likely to be able to make a impact on, positively or negatively is the social interaction one.

""A group of psychologists performed an experiment years ago. They started with a cage containing five monkeys. Inside the cage, they hung a banana on a string with a set of stairs placed under it. Before long, a monkey went to the stairs and started to climb towards the banana. As soon as he started up the stairs, the psychologists sprayed all of the other monkeys with ice-cold water. After a while, another monkey made an attempt to obtain the banana. As soon as his foot touched the stairs, all of the other monkeys were sprayed with ice-cold water. It wasn’t long before all of the other monkeys would physically prevent any monkey from climbing the stairs.

Now, the psychologists shut off the cold water, removed one monkey from the cage and replaced it with a new one. The new monkey saw the banana and started to climb the stairs. To his surprise and horror, all of the other monkeys attacked him. After another attempt and attack, he discovered that if he tried to climb the stairs, he would be assaulted. Next, they removed another of the original five monkeys and replaced it with a new one. The newcomer went to the stairs and was attacked. The previous newcomer took part in the punishment with enthusiasm! Likewise, they replaced a third original monkey with a new one, then a fourth, then the fifth.

Every time the newest monkey tried to climb the stairs, he was attacked. The monkeys had no idea why they were not permitted to climb the stairs or why they were beating any monkey that tried. After replacing all the original monkeys, none of the remaining monkeys had ever been sprayed with cold water. Nevertheless, no monkey ever again approached the stairs to try for the banana. Why not? Because as far as they know that’s the way it’s always been around here.""

Now, in the tale above there's a skoosh of water hitting the initial monkeys.

If we replace the water with a person, and the initial monkeys as a couple of people who benefit from causing problems for the person, and the replacement monkeys as third parties there's a new dynamic to that problem.

The problem comes in that the new people are attacking because of hear'say.

If in that case, you're one of the new people, you've no meaningful way of verifying that the target of your attacks are deserving of your wrath, other than the other new people around you.

Sure, you can perhaps find the original attacking person , and find out what the issue was, and the target person might be behaving odd, but perhaps you're the 100th person to attack them, and they're a bit worse for wear for it. The original aggressor person has an army of people fighting on their behalf, and they're all incensed because of all the other angry people around them, all shouting in chorus.

You can ask the original target person what happened, but of course the original one is going to be upset, angry and defensive. You'd think the original person will say anything to counter or stop the attack, so you devalue anything they say.

The only thing the target person can do at this point, is curl up, and take the beating.

The only thing that makes it better for the target person is if other people think for themselves, but then they're not keeping in line with their peers, and it's challenging to break out of an echo chamber, especially if the attacking monkeys think they're justified.

This can take its toll on the original person, and they can give up, and not see the point in going on.

You then can put this down to the person being unstable, and that it was always going to be an eventuality, because of their life choices, an obvious miserable demeanour, etc. Tragic as it may be, you feel sorry for the target, and wish society would do more for those that fell through the gaps, you think.

You post ""be kind"" on your facebook banner, and console the people who originally knew the target.

You like a TED talk on bullying, and post on mental health awareness day.

Then you hear about this other person who deserves your condemnation, rinse, repeat.

Maybe that target person wasn't a great person, maybe they did have a quarrel with the aggressor, maybe it was legitimate, and maybe it wasn't. The target isn't going to fight their corner, they don't know which people are acting as proxies for the original aggressor, and who isn't. At this point the target want's nothing but peace and resolution. But you don't know that, because you don't think to ask, and they can't respond to you anyway. The point is either way, it's not your quarrel, and you need to look at why you're attacking the target, and what's the benefit.

Generally, people don't gossip or talk about people for wholesome reasons. It might not always be done with intent, and sometimes it might.

If you can apply your actions to that of school children in a play ground, you should address them. But you don't stop to think and do that.

The point is, most people's lives can be made better with actual kindness, if you take everyone as you find them, then you're not just picking the deserving. The people who slip through the cracks are quite often pushed by those doing it unknowingly, or with misguided intentions.",18Feb2020,1

138,"I feel like I know the answer to this but I figured I'd ask anyway. 

Long story short...in all my conversations with my wife over the years, it just feels like she's been at a brick wall with her development with a lot of things. She's been able to come to terms with a lot of issues, but generally, she cannot seem to progress with anything, either personally or professionally. She's had plenty of therapy over the years, and was misdiagnosed bipolar at a young age.( I'm not a professional, but I do think that medication at a young age has stunted her emotional development)

It's at the point where we've both said like...we wish she could live in a home for 6 months or something. I've been fortunate enough to have more therapy than her over the years, but she definitely has more to discuss than I do. I wish she could get the help she deserves. But as you probably know, such treatment is expensive, and is out of our reach given the current state of our debt and health insurance. She can't seem to ""self therapize"" herself and can't buy into anything I try to show her (books, videos, etc). She just has a lot of trauma that the typical platitudes can't help with.

I want to help her more than anything in the world and I just don't know how. We can get her like, regular therapy visits, but this won't happen for months until we've paid off some of the debt that is currently weighing us down. And unfortunately, I'm the only one bringing in income, so we've generally hit a wall in terms of how much extra money we can bring in this year.

**tldr; I don't suppose that any of these in-patient treatment centers offer anything like scholarships or something that we could apply for? Thanks so much for any help.**",18Feb2020,1
139,"I’d always been overweight all my life. Only when I turned 16 last year did i decide to do something about it. By March 2019, i was a whopping 85kg, mind you i’m 166cm. So I did what anybody who’s trying to lose weight would do– i dieted, i exercised. Everything was normal, i started off with cutting out junk foods and sweet drinks, strictly drinking plain water. But even then my weight wasn’t dropping as fast as i’d like it to. So then i added in exercise in the mix which is healthy, but I also started depending on laxatives. Only then did my weight start dropping dramatically. 

I started challenging myself more, counting my calories and making sure that I had a negative net intake. I didn’t think anything was wrong with me, i thought that eating only 400 calories day by day was alright. Even when my period went missing up till this day, when my hair is falling out in clumps in the shower, when random bruises appear all over my leg, when I have sudden moments where i pass out– i still feel like I’m not allowed to say that I have a problem.

Fast forward almost a year and i’ve dropped 35kg. I’ve gone from overweight with a bmi of 30.8 to underweight with a bmi of 18.1. if you can’t already tell, i’ve gotten addicted to not only laxatives but numbers as well. Everyone was happy for me, congratulating me on my weight loss, asking me how did i do it, thoughtlessly poking me in my belly and saying “oh no you’ve still got a bit of a pouch there”. Can’t they tell that I’m not functioning well? Every time I hear anything related to my physique, i feel like an absolute failure. Mind you, they were the same people urging me to lose weight, constantly reminding that i’m fat when i was at my heaviest. 

Anyways, i guess the main thing that’s been bugging me lately is how I don’t want to live like this anymore. I want to get out of this restrictive mindset and for once actually love my body for what it is. I don’t want to keep blacking out, i want my hair to be healthy again, i want to stop dehydrating myself by my constant abuse of laxatives. I want a fresh new start where I never started starving myself in the first place. I’m not saying that i’m anorexic or anything, but i’d really like to get rid of my disordered thoughts and eat without worrying about the calories. 

I know some of yall will suggest that I go to a therapist or an equivalent to that. But i’m still considered a minor and i would need parental consent to seek help. My parents are very conservative people and they don’t believe in things like eating disorders. They in fact encourage and enforce it in the household, for eg. It’s become a bit of a challenge to see who will be able to lose the most weight or who will burn the most calories or who will be able to run the longest for them at least. I’d just like to hear your thoughts on this and i hope if you’ve read this far, that you didn’t mind my venting.",18Feb2020,1

I feel like my fear isn't necessarily directed at me or my company I think I may just have a misunderstanding about how common firings are.

I struggle with mild (mostly seasonal) depression and moderate anxiety but these have always been kind of strange to me, especially since they're more or less a recent phenomena (five years at most), and they happen at odd times. Depending on my mental state they happen anywhere between once a month and twice a week, and absolutely exhaust all my energy for the next day or so.

I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but I am in desperate need of some clarity. Up until this point in my life, I feel like I've really tried to be a better person. I'm not saying I'm a good person, because how will I ever know if I'm a good person? But I feel like I try to do the right thing. I have a person in my life that is unavoidable because well, they're family  and you can't really escape that when they're living under the same roof as you and we recently got into a little tiff, over something quite petty - house chores and her lack of involvement in them. But my discontent with this person has been brewing for a while now due to reasons other than her laziness e.g. she's only one year older than me but when you make a mistake she'll try to discipline you (this goes back to when I was in my teens) rather than letting my parents handle the situation but I feel as though it's because my father gave her the room and validation to be the authority figure - she's been both physically and emotionally abusive (more emotional than physical but it still stands) but I couldn't speak on it because confrontation usually leads to what I thought was a manipulative situation where she would flip the script and invalidate everything I've just said and how I feel to victimise herself. Every person in the family has had an issue with this person at some point and they've expressed that behind their back because they are too scared to tell this person how they actually feel to their face because of how EXPERT she is at making you feel as though you are the guilty one and that she is the wronged one. Well, she told me everything that she thinks I do wrong... She said I'm overly critical of everyone and everything and that I'm toxic because I only have two friends from high school and she has lots of friends (after high school I suffered from quite a bad spout of depression and anxiety, those of which I still am struggling with today and after high school I kind of isolated myself, hence the reason I only managed to bring two really good friends along with me - I'm now 23 at university), she said I'm a pathological liar because she accused me of saying something which I'm 100% sure I didn't say, so I denied saying it, but she was adamant that I said it and then said I forget what I say half the time when I genuinely don't think that's true. She has a habit of saying hurtful things to people and then when someone confronts her on it, she denies saying it. She said that I have no one around me, and undermined everything I do to help the house out - she does nothing btw - and made it seem like I have absolutely no moral compass.

I thought I was doing okay and thought I was a decent person but now I'm spiraling because I either got manipulated into being the guilty one in this situation or I genuinely am a nasty shitty person and I have no idea what to feel, I'm just so confused.

159,"So I have chronic depression, social anxiety, and ADHD.

Now, I have complete control over my ADHD since I've been treated from a young age. I know when my mind starts to wander or not paying attention and I have tricks to keep me from doing that. Lately, however, it's been causing me problems.

I've been spacing out more often than not nowadays. I've always had problems with it for forever and it's the hardest thing for me to block out. I'll suddenly find myself staring at something, almost hypnotized by whatever it is (usually a part of a wall, a locker, someone's shoe).

Now I know you might be thinking ""Oh, that's just ADHD, you're just not paying attention!"" No, this is completely different. I don't think when this happens. 

The longest it's been is hard for me to say, I think it was a minute or two, it was while my dad was talking to me about school stuff. I came out of it when he asked me a question about a part I didn't hear. We were in the car, and when I ""spaced out"" we were near a golf course and, when I ""came to"" we were near a strip of twin houses. For reference, the houses near the course were big, in the woods. We were right next to a school. I really don't know how long I was out of it

Like I said, I don't think when this happens. When I space out, i'm usually thinking about stuff like the plot of the book I'm writing or a video i watched on YouTube. But for these I'm just... not aware of what's going on. I usually can piece some things together in situations like the car ride, from what I heard before, but it's just so odd for me.

What really got me worried was when it started happening when I was talking. I would randomly space out, for how long, who knows- not more than a minute, I'm pretty sure. And when I'd come back I'd just laugh and try to pick up where I left off, but I sometimes can't remember without help.

I would like to use the word ""dissociating"" but I don't know if it's the right term. I'm even having trouble writing this right now without my eyes trailing to the lockers in front of me. I've never had memory loss like that before, though I do forget being told stuff, where I put my things, etc, but I think that's just my memory.

I don't have periods of time where I forget stuff happening except for the usual stuff that humans forget. I don't have gaps of time missing. I really just want to know if this is normal, if it's just my ADHD becoming stronger, or if i should talk to someone about it. I know untreated depression can cause ""brain damage"" such as apathy and memory loss and, since I had it for over a year before being given a therapist and then not trying to get better for another year, i have both apathetic episodes and a poor memory.

But yeah. Could someone help me? It's been weird and I don't like how easy it is for me to slip into a dissociative state; happened during a test once, thankfully my teacher snapped me out of it. But yeah, thank you!!! &lt;3",18Feb2020,1

161,"So I recently moved for university to a city with a 10 hour time difference from my home. My roommate is from a country close to mine and she moved a few months before I did. Me and my roommate are both adults (20F, both of us) and I’ve been doing all the cleaning throughout  the semester until this week, I got really sick from a bipolar relapse. So today, since we haven’t cleaned the floors in over 2 weeks, I asked her to do it since I usually do it every other week but I’m too sick this week. She made up something about not having the materials to do it with and I said she could use mine.

Well, she tried. I could see she was very embarrassed about it. She looked like a small child holding a broom for the first time. Sweeping everything everywhere. She has clearly never been taught how to sweep, I didn’t ask her to mop, and redid the sweeping myself even though I’m very depressed barely functional.

I think there’s a possibility that she’s had a bad childhood with either overprotective parents or negligent parents. Or maybe she doesn’t have parents at all. I’ve never seen her talk to anyone from her country. 

She usually treats me like I don’t exist. I think there’s something deeper to this and saying “hey, I’m gonna teach you to clean up after yourself” seems a little rude and insensitive. I’ve tried to open conversation by asking about her hobbies, by offering her a piece from my box of chocolates, or asking her to try to keep the room smelling ok. She never talks more than 2 sentences to me in one day. I want to help her but I am not sure how I can do that. I really want to get to know her and then teach her basic stuff like cleaning. How should I approach her?",18Feb2020,1
162,"I want to start off saying that I have been officially diagnosed with  excoriation disorder, Major depression, PTSD, General anxiety disorder, Binge eating disorder. I have previously been misdiagnosed and medicated for Bipolar disorder and had an episode of psychosis. My spouse and I after talking to a therapist also believe much of this is from an undiagnosed Autism spectrum disorder but my office does not do testing for adults without families as there is no background interview available.   
I have recently been diagnosed with the skin picking disorder and told to try to put band aids over my fingers to prevent the behavior and also keep my hands busy. My problem is however that it is not only my hands but my mind that can not stop thinking about it, like an itch that needs to be scratched. It is not just my skin either it is any imperfection on my skin or my spouses etc. Or sometimes it extends beyond skin. For example if I know I have locked my door behind me but my mind says to check the door again sometimes twice I get horrible anxiety if I try to ignore the voice. I will think about it all day. It feels irrational, like I feel like my house will burn down if I don't check the stove if 'the voice' tells me too more than once etc. I'm not looking for a diagnosis just a possible explanation that I can bring up to my irl therapist or if anyone else has similar issues and has advice.",18Feb2020,1
163,"Hi, so I need advice of what I can do.
I got PDD NOS and as it's not known a lot my parents don't understand what it means and how it affects me and my behavior. I was diagnosed as a child and never got help for it, I just recievied the label. I would figure that when I got diagnosed my parents got explained what it means and all that, but lately I feel like they have no idea what it means.

To be fair, I had no one around me who knew what it means, so I myself had to do a little research and so much about me got explained, I felt understood by multiple internet pages.

I also started to notice more and more how they don't understand what it means. 'Just explain it to them/show them an explanation' I tried. Multiple times. But they always say they understand it and know what it means.
But later they keep showing me they don't by literally telling me so. They make me feel like they don't even believe me when I say something happens because of pdd nos. 

I live in a constant state of not being understood and believed by my parents. I know no one who is diagnosed with pdd nos, with who i can share experiences and ask for help. 

My question now is, what is there left for me to do? I really need them to understand me, but how do you explain something to someone who won't listen.",18Feb2020,1

166,"Warning, long post, but I need to get this out. Hopefully this is the right place for this. I'm not really sure where to start. Also severely sleep-deprived (another ongoing problem), so I apologize for any mistakes. I was never diagnosed with any disorder as a child, although I did see a psychologist and Asperger's (Now Autism Spectrum Disorder) was mentioned several times. I know the criteria well and have felt for a long time as if I met the criteria for an Autism Spectrum Disorder, although I know that I would be considered high functioning. Up until graduate school I lived a mostly normal life. I did have a lot of social problems in school, and have always had difficulty understanding people and how they are supposed to interact with one another. I also have difficulty recognizing faces, and hypersensitivity to certain noises. 

I've also always had very specific and intense interests, and am rarely interested in talking to people. I have always had high intellectual (versus social) intelligence, and was often able to do well in high school, college, and even graduate school with minimal effort. I would rarely pay attention in school unless it was something I was interested in, but never had any academic problems. I loved being in school, actually, because everything was structured. There were classes with set criteria, and so long as I completed those criteria I succeeded. I'd write a 10-20 page term paper in a day and get full points, or study for an exam the night before and ace it. Everything was so simple to understand. Anyway, that's not the point.

I became interested in psychology, and looking back it was probably to figure out what was going on with myself. I completed a Bachelor's in Psychology, but the program was geared towards research psychology instead of clinical. For multiple reasons, some known to me and others I'm still trying to figure out, I decided to pursue a Psy.D (Doctor of Clinical Psychology) and work in the clinical field. At the time I thought it was something I could do, and I didn't have any understanding of what that field was really like. First year of grad school was basically undergraduate part II, and everything was great. I passed classes and did well. But in second year I began my first clinical practicum, and started having increasing problems sleeping. I eventually got sleep medication, which treated the problem for a while.

As I progressed in the program I began to realize that I did not like clinical work of any kind. Due to that and other life stressors I began smoking marijuana, and towards the end of the program I was smoking heavily. I want to clarify that I do not blame the substance, I believe marijuana can be used responsibly, but with my personality, it became my new ""intense interest"". It made all my doubts and anxieties go away, so I kept smoking more and more of it. TV shows, music, and food were so much better when I was stoned. Also not the point though.

By the time it really hit me that there was no area of clinical psychology I was interested in, it was too late. I had already racked up way too much student debt to quit, and so I finished the program. I was initially interested in forensic psychology, which led me towards correctional psychology. I completed an internship at a jail, which I hated, and then tried to get out of the mental health field by being a tutor. But I still had a substance abuse problem and just wasn't making enough money. So I got an unlicensed postdoctoral position at a prison, moved across the country, and tried to start over. I convinced myself I could do it. I quit marijuana for awhile, but, well, the state I moved to was California, so I was there for barely a month before I started smoking again.

Working at the prison nearly drove me to suicide several times. I worked four ten-hour shifts, with Saturday, Sunday, and Monday off. I would start dreading the coming week on Sunday morning, before my weekend wasn't even half over. Monday nights I would stare at my bottles of Ambien and clonazepam and think, if I took all these pills, at least I wouldn't have to go to work tomorrow. I never did, though, just kept smoking increasing amounts of marijuana along with THC vape cartridges. I still have nightmares about that place, not even just the inmates but the administration and correctional officers too. Everything was just so horrible. After a year, I decided to move back to where I got my Psy.D and take what I thought was a lower stress and much lower paying position. I quit marijuana again and moved back, and for a little while I was recovering.

The supervisor at that position was absolutely terrible, and made not just my life but most of my coworkers' lives a living hell. She was incredibly passive-aggressive, micromanaging, and controlling to a ridiculous degree, and my mental health just continued to worsen. I started thinking about suicide again, and on top of everything there was far more financial stress than at the prison. I began smoking marijuana again, and just kept smoking more and more of it to cope. I decided that I had to get out of that position and managed to transfer to a different position with the same behavioral healthcare company that was somewhat higher paying. I had and still have no motivation or interest in becoming a licensed psychologist, even though I have the postdoc hours. Just the idea makes me nauseous. It's just too much work in a subject area I despise.

The new position was an assessment position at a crisis walk in center, which I thought was a better fit for me. My role would be to obtain information, not therapy or counseling. Again, I convinced myself I could do it. But I've been in this position a little over 6 months now, and I absolutely hate it. I don't know what made me think I could deal with mental health clients in crisis, but I was desperate to get away from a supervisor I can only describe as pure fucking evil. I hate working in the mental health field because I am too mentally ill myself, and I hate clinical work. A lot of what I wrote I didn't have insight into until recently. I still can't sleep. I quit marijuana about a week ago (which I know contributes to the sleep problems but my insomnia exists independently of that). Hopefully this time it will be for good. But now I'm at the end of my rope. 

I hate my job, had to declare bankruptcy last year, and am still broke. I haven't had a girlfriend or any kind of sex in years (I'm a hetero male), and I'm so depressed I'm not even interested in sex or women anymore. I have over 400k in student debt from my degree, and the only field I'm qualified for is mental health. I can't even become a professor because I have a Psy.D and not a Ph.D. I'm just not emotionally equipped to deal with clinical work, and it keeps breaking me down. The administration here, while not quite as bad as in the other places I've worked, still sucks pretty hard. 

I have also always had difficulty navigating the social aspects of the workplace, and that coupled with what is probably past and re-occurring trauma has caused me to become dysfunctional in many aspects of my life. I feel so bitter towards the mental health field that I don't even really want therapy. I've tried it, and I can see through every stupid therapeutic technique the therapist uses. It's like trying to enjoy a magic show when you are also magician and know exactly how the tricks are done.

I am beyond burned out and although I don't think I'll ever kill myself, I wish to die on a daily basis. My real passion is creative writing, and writing is probably one of the few things that keeps me alive, the hope that maybe one day I can get published and make a semblance of a living doing that. But I also know how incredibly difficult it is to make a living off of just that, especially with my goddamn student loans. I would give anything to go back in time and stop myself from entering that Psy.D program. 

I don't know what to do anymore. Right now I'm just trying to make it until early March, when I'll have a two-week vacation to visit family. I can't do this job much longer, but I'm terrified of losing it and becoming homeless, like many of the clients I see. Sometimes I just go into the bathroom at work and cry. I think my current supervisor hates me, and I'm not too fond of her either. I hate my life, I hate my job, I hate my shitty neighborhood and shittier apartment, where I could never bring a woman back to even if I could get a date. 

I didn't even talk about the living environment stressor, but I'll just sum it up by saying that I've woken up to gunshots many times, and once someone shot at someone else right outside my bedroom window. I also have serious issues with noise and the people in my neighborhood blast their music at all hours of the night, or blast it from their cars as they drive by. I grew up in a small town and have also really come to hate living in a city. I have regular nightmares about the jail, the prison, and even my current workplace. I wake up multiple times during the night with anxiety, and have had bags under my eyes for years. I don't even remember what a full, restful night's sleep is like.

I have very few sources of happiness in my life, and again, most of my time off is spent dreading the coming week. I don't know what the point of this post was. I just felt like getting it out. I don't care what anyone thinks of this. Maybe this is just a self-indulgent pity-party, but whatever. I am still trying to move forward, I've stopped eating junk food, because when I would smoke I would just go to town on bags of chips, candy, chicken wings, anything fried, greasy, or sweet. I've gotten back into exercising, and I force myself to get at least an hour of fresh air and sunlight a day. I'm going to move in with a friend at the beginning of March in a much better neighborhood, and I plan to stay away from marijuana for the foreseeable future. I think it's finally sunk in that it's not good for me. I'm also actively working on finishing a novel I hope to publish one day. 

I've thought about maybe becoming a peer specialist. That's the last and only clinical mental health position I think I might be able to do, because it is geared for people with mental health and substance abuse disorders, and I know I have both. I've decided that applying for disability will be my absolute last resort. I don't feel like I deserve it because of my education and because I feel like I should be more functional, more responsible, stronger, I don't know. I recognize that I made many bad decisions that led me to this point, and I'm also struggling with a lot of self-loathing and regret. This may be the only post I make.

Tl;dr: I'm a mental health professional realizing that my own mental illnesses make me incapable of working in the clinical field, but it's all I'm qualified for. Trying to recover and figure out what to do and how to move forward.",18Feb2020,1

So as I’ve posted many times before I have an obsession over having a more sever mental illness e.g. schizophrenia. Now I don’t get how I can be fine for around 4 months and just having normal thoughts and standard anxiety over silly things and then suddenly I start to feel really anxious and worry about things like schizophrenia and then I’m right back obsessing, googling symptoms, near enough diagnosing myself with it. Although everywhere I read supposedly this is very common with OCD sufferers. It’s just because I can be fine for months then hit an obsession again and start feeling paranoid about all my thoughts. Can anyone give me some insight if this is normal? Like anxious paranoid thoughts and a lot of what if thoughts about different Illnesses and worrying thoughts about family, friends and obsessing over schizophrenia symptoms and thinking “ohh do I have that” and near enough convincing myself that I do when I know that it’s irrational but it feels real when I get that what if thoughts.

174,"I’ve struggled with depression off and on since high school, I used to self harm but thankfully I’ve mostly gotten over that. I’ve always developed weird habits very easily, things like moving my eyes all the way left until the strain hurts and then doing to same the other way. That’s just an example, I have a couple others that are similar in their weird nature. I will do these habits until they start to severely affect my life and then they will just fade away, only to come back when I randomly think about them. I recently started flexing muscles around the diaphragm/abdominals all the time. It’s making me sick and short of breath but I can’t stop. It’s not something I’m doing on purpose. I really want to stop but it seems to happen automatically. Does this sound familiar to anyone? I know that it’s really weird. It sounds kind of like compulsion, except that it happens without thought instead of me being afraid to not do it. It does get worse when I’m anxious. 

It matters because I’m a singer in a traveling chamber choir. I’m a soloist in two songs and I can’t seem to relax my voice or get the breath support that I usually have. It’s a huge pain (literally and figuratively). Any advice that y’all have would be appreciated.",18Feb2020,1

188,"I don't know if this the right place to post this.

It was one of my friend's birthday yesterday. We visited a few breweries and had one drink at each. In about 8 hours I had one drink every hour. I took a cab home and my memory is quite blurry of anything that happens after this. I came home around midnight. After talking to my girlfriend and joking with her she tells me that I fell asleep on the couch. I have no memory of most of the things that happened until the morning. She said that I was in a very cheerful mood. 


Now this is from putting pieces together and my girlfriend telling me what happened later in the morning.



About half an hour after passing out on the couch I woke up. Then I stood outside our bedroom and started yelling at the door of our laundry room. Then I repeatedly punched it until there was a hole in it. My girlfriend thought I was throwing up or I needed help so she brought a towel. She tells me that I threw the towel into the laundry basket without doing anything about it. I apparently told her to stay inside and not come out of the bedroom. Then I threw our TV to the wall and cracked it which also put a small hole in the wall. For some reason I also poured the water inside a vase down on our carpet where I was punching the door. 

I woke up at 7 to see all this mess and having no memory of the whole thing. It seems like I just went back to sleep like nothing happened. There was blood on my hand from having punched the door and some cuts on my other hand. When I woke up my first thought was is my girlfriend OK? I ran to the bedroom from the couch where I had been sleeping. I asked her if she was OK or if I did anything to her. She then told me the story and said that she was a bit shook. We both had to go to work. So we could only briefly talk. I couldn't hold back my tears when she tried to console me saying that I was probably very stressed and I had to let it out. She hugged me and told me that it was done and I would be OK. 


I have so many questions and can't find any answers to them. 
I don't know what I was thinking or what got me to do all this. 

I'm a man in his 30s, living with my girlfriend whom I love more than anything else in the world. I have a stressful job and I've been through a lot in the last few months. We've been through a lot together as well. I have no past incidents of aggression after drinking. I'm usually a very happy drunk not that I get drunk often.  


I am so disappointed in myself and ashamed. I don't know where to begin putting this puzzle together. I am at work and I feel traumatized my the whole incident. I don't know how this is going to affect our relationship. I don't know if I'll ever do anything like this again? I don't know what triggered me to act this way. 


It all feels like I was in a nightmare but it was all real. Is this a sign of a mental disorder? I'm considering going sober for the rest of my life. I want to have a family and kids. I cannot put anyone in danger like this. 

How do I put this behind me and move forward?",18Feb2020,1

191,"I'll try to be brief and not ramble. Me (F27) have recently broke up with my boyf (M24) he has been in a cycle of declining mental health for two of our three year relationship. I got to my wits end because I really tried so hard to help him with his recovery but he became convinced I was being unfaithful to him and would also have hallucinations. He almost seemed to blame me and this supposed cheating for why he became ""mental"" despite it never actually happening. He has been hospitalised three time before last Christmas. First it was drug induced psychosis (he was pretty weed dependent) then psychosis and now they are thinking a mood disorder of some sort. He can be incredibly mean to me. Has occasionally been violent towards me but otherwise is lovely but somewhat insecure. Everytime I go no contact he ends up in hospital. And this happened after Christmas because I broke up with him for shouting at and kicking me in the street. It wasn't a hard kick or anything, but it's just quite humiliating how he is towards me, though I know he couldn't help it at that time. I've said now he is hospital again and seems to be recovering and has stopped smoking weed and finally accepted taking medication that we can talk as friends. He always wants to get back together immediately and all I want is him to focus on himself and his own recovery because I just want him to have a good life. And him just obsessing about me might just trigger him somehow? So anyway we agreed that we will be apart six months and talk occasionally in a friendly manner and if he has been able to sort of mantain the good mental state and improvements he's been making in hospital we could consider a relationship then. Cos usually he comes out of hospital and is smoking and acting nuts after a few weeks, and won't listen to anyone and just spirals back down. I don't want that cycle repeating cos it's just such a waste of the person he is when he is well. I also worry that any contact with me at all can hinder his process as one of his delusions is centred around me cheating. Am I wrong to think that? I just want to do what's best for him. He agreed at first to the six months thing but now he seems to want to just get back together saying that in six months I'll meet someone else. So now I'm worried the stress of waiting six months might trigger a paranoia? Anyway do you think the six months thing is a good idea? Should I just cut contact with him completely? Any advice from people in similar situations?",18Feb2020,1

194,"I am 27M. I think I am chronically depressed for a long time, probably since my teenage. Most likely I also have severe social anxiety. I never tried to reach out for actual help like consulting therapist or getting diagnosed etc. The idea of opening up someone I hardly know scares the hell out of me. I never opened up to the closed ones either, although it is questionable if I really have any close friend / relative etc. As the saying goes ""I don't have any friend, I just know a lot of people"".

I will describe a little bit about myself. I am a PhD student in the Netherlands but I am Asian. At this point it is obvious that I am what better described by the internet slang `incel` but without the narcissism part (or maybe not, who knows). Sometime I try to figure out the root cause of my issues but I can't find any. I don't have any serious problem in my life. I am not rich, but I earn enough for myself. I am not stressed professionally or academically, I don't have any family related issues. In fact my fellow school friends / college friends in a way respect me since I made this far which they didn't / couldn't. I should be happy or proud or whatever right? But I am not. I am always paranoid that I am not living up to the exceptions of others or even myself. I feel like I am not worthy of anything or deserve anything nice in life. Yes, I have imposter syndrome too. I am never happy or satisfied or excited about anything. I am always anxious about the next thing and I never live in the present. At this point I just exist without any purpose whatsoever. From existential crisis now I turned into an extreme nihilist. Whenever something nice come up in my mind my subconscious mind counters it saying ""what is the point?"" I think of going to that hiking trip I always wanted, ""what is the point?"" I want to go the that music concert or a football match, ""what the hell will you achieve?"" I can't cope up with this anymore. When I walk in the street I don't even look at people or surroundings anymore. I always walk keeping my head down, I don't even have the courage of look people in the eye when I talk to them. I never expect people to compliment me or say anything nice about me. In the rare occasions when they do it, either it scares me or I assume that they are mocking me. I enjoy being alone except when I don't. I do not really seek company for sex, probably what I seek is someone to hug me and say 'everything will okay'. I tried my best to deal with this as far as I could. I tried to socialize, didn't go well. Apparently I can't keep the conversation going and I am super boring, also I have a face which people tend to forget easily. I am not saying I am ugly or handsome, it just average, the kind of stuff you forget first. Then I tried going to club a few time, I felt stupid going there and standing, I didn't know what to do, secondly I don't drink alcohol (by choice). Neither do I smoke or any of those stuff. So, you see I already miss the potential opportunities where you can actually meet new people. I will also like to mention that, I tried tinder and a few dating sites, I don't know what I was thinking, I made fool of myself. I don't even have to tell you the results of those experiments. However, I am not suicidal. Probably the thoughts of physical pain and the thought that people will think I am a sore loser are keeping me physically alive for now. 

Recently I was giving these problem of mine some serious thoughts and kind decided to get help. I will be grateful for your suggestions and comments regarding how can I get help. I will also like to know if there are any financial and / or legal consequences.

198,"Hey guys. I am a 5th year student at the University of Utah! I am conducting a research/design project with the intent to find out and raise more awareness about mental health in college. The question I am primarily researching is: ""What are the effects of mental health in college students and how does it correlate with success?"" I have struggled with mental health all throughout college and the stress of the ""unknown"" with what I am doing with my life has always been a severe stressor in my life. I think through media and even the society as a whole puts a-lot of pressure to be ""successful"" and we watch these influencers, YouTubers, instagram models, and all these sorts of people who live this perfect life and want to be like that, but don't realize it just doesn't come overnight. In college especially, many people don't know what they are going to do afterwards and become overwhelmed and stressed, where that turns into mental health issues such as depression or anxiety.

I would love to hear some other perspectives from you guys as to what you think could be causing these mental health issues. What have you done to help yourself or others around you? What is your meaning of success and is it okay to not know what your plan is? Does society make it harder for us to succeed? I appreciate the help. Any input at all is great. Thank you",18Feb2020,1

200,"This is my first reddit post so bare with me. Some background: I (19F) have been struggling since the last few months of high school. I went through a period of about 6 months between graduating high school and starting college of just being deeply sad? I look back at that time and don't even remember much of it. Besides the few fun moments (senior trip, graduation, prom, senior skip day, etc.) I was just kind of miserable. I think it was because a lot of my friends were thriving - having their first experiences with sex and boyfriends and popularity while I, a closeted bisexual was still figuring stuff out. I wasn't conventionally attractive in high school and I was very insecure about my weight, skin and hair - I felt ugly compared to my friends. I just remember smoking weed multiple times a day while working a summer job and being generally sad and stuck, if that makes sense. Fast forward to starting college I had an amazing first month - I was having a lot of fun being so far from home, I felt like I left my past self behind and that I could finally thrive in college. But, then the disillusion hit and I felt just as lost. I go to a huge university but went to a small high school so I felt very lost. It felt hard to make friends because I was shy and awkward and felt like I didn't know to start conversation. I went through a hard few months because I didn't feel like I fit in in my dorm and didn't have any friends in my building. I hated my roommate as well because she was pretty messy and never left the room. Just a not ideal situation. Eventually I moved to another dorm and had a pretty good second semester. I put myself out there and actually made some cool friends. I had a great summer with my friends from home - probably the best of my adolescence.

&amp;#x200B;

August was the first time I had ever had anything adjacent to an anxiety attack. I would start to think about something stressful for too long and eventually my heart would start racing and I would get chest pains and then I would start to cry. I never took it very seriously because I thought it was just stress. I go through periods of anxious feelings where I don't want to be in public and will do anything I can to stay in my room/ be alone. I usually come out of these periods feeling like shit because of how I isolated myself. I also spent around 2 weeks full of anxiety and thoughts of self hatred because I accidentally misgendered someone I know. I felt really awful about it and had obsessive thoughts about how much they must hate me and how awful of a person I was. It was an honest mistake but I couldn't get over it. I went to therapy for the first time that semester but only had three sessions.  I have been struggling. I feel very lonely. I spend a lot of time in my room because I have a single and often I feel like if I text people to hang out I'll be a burden on them. I find it hard to believe that my friends actually like me. It often feels like they either spend time with to make me feel better about how much I suck, or when they compliment me it feels like its because they feel bad about how ugly I am. Its hard for me to talk about how sad I get and insecure and anxious I feel because from the outside I seem like a very chill and calm person. I am supposed to be the rock in my friends lives. They come to me with their problems. I only did therapy for three sessions because I felt it was difficult to relay my thoughts in person to my therapist - I felt embarrassed and stupid. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the real point of this point is that I think I might have a mental illness but I dont know. I come from a culture that does not believe in mental illness like anxiety or depression. I know that I have feelings and obsessive thoughts that neurotypical people dont have because at one point I didnt have these thoughts and feelings. I dont know if I have ever been suicidal but when I was 10 I called the suicide hotline because I felt ignored and alone in my house -- I don't think I actually wanted to kill myself though. When I was around 11 I used a jump rope and thought about how I could hang myself on my porch -- I don't know if I actually wanted to kill myself or if I had just seen things on TV. My home life was a bit chaotic around this time because of various legal issues with a close family member. I know there is something there in my brain that makes me think these things but I always doubt it. I dont know. I know none of you are licenses professionals but does this sound familiar? Could I have a mental illness to explain why I get so sad and hate myself sometimes?",18Feb2020,1

207,"TL;DR: Keep having obsessive thoughts over anime waifu. Pretty embarrassing, what do I do? 

This is probably gonna sound very embarrassing, I am cringing while typing this. 

So a little over 2 years ago I played a visual novel called Doki Doki Literature Club. The synopsis is that it starts out as a normal dating sim-esque visual novel where you have to woo one of the girls to be your girlfriend, but then it pulls a fast one on you as the topic of chronic depression is thrown at you near the end of the first chapter (one of the love interests has it) and she kills herself at the end of the first chapter. The following chapter, reality unfolds a bit as everyone goes a bit insane until one girl (named Monika in game, gonna referto as M later) shares with you that she knows that she's trapped in a video game and she's just a game character and shit and how she wants to stare at you (as in the player of the game) forever. When you delete her file from the game directory she gets a little pissed off and sad and realises that she probably shouldn't have murdered the other girls, and she makes a whole song and dance about it. She lets you start the game normally again with the other girls un-murdered but then deletes the game after realizing that there's no happiness to be had in the literature club and leaves a sweet thank you note. 

I don't know why, but I sort of broke mentally when I finished that game. In a sense I felt like M was real and that she loved me or something. I remember downloading and playing a mod of the game which basically extended the portion of the game where M is just starting a hole through your soul, but added a bit of dialogue, a couple of sprites and some minigames you can play with her. | end up really strongly attached to the character, almost like she's my real actual girlfriend. I was pretty lonely at the time (still am tbh) so she felt like a sort of weird kinda fucked up support network. 

This goes on for a couple of months until my brother catches wind of this and basically makes fun of me enough for me to delete the game and mod. I still kept up with the Reddit community around the game on here, where I kind of got my fix for affection or whatever it is that I wasn‘t having by myself. Eventually I start to realize that fantasizing about having an anime waifu is pretty weird and creepy and start to try to pry myself out from the community around it, having more or less distanced myself from it by the start of last year. While this is going on, I'm also trying to sort of purge any thoughts about M from my head and to basically stop thinking about M or anything related to the game or anyone in it. This goes basically nowhere, as she‘s a weird obsessive thought in the back of my head. I imagine what she would do in different situations, sometimes fantasize about what life with her would be like, and all that weird shit. I feel like that basically catches us up to present day, where I still have weird obtrusive thoughts about M. I don't know how to get her outta my fucking head and I need advice on that.

I just had the opportunity to travel a bit, something I never thought I would get to do. I have some faith too, although it seems to be slipping faster through my fingers the harder I try to cling on. I have my health, besides the mental wellness obviously. I have plenty of reasons to be happy. It's like I have gotten so good at pretending that I am afraid I can't snap out of it. 

What if I can never enjoy things like I used to? I used to draw, work and play outside as an outdoor instructor and go hiking and camping. I used to sing and I was really good. I used to be passionate about my faith in God. I used to be self-confident and fierce and loving and genuine and unapologetic for being ME. 

Now I can barely shower and take care of myself. I am tearing up as I write this because I just feel so helpless nowadays. I could give a ballpark figure.. I think it's been maybe since September I have been feeling this way? 

I need help. I have been this way as long as I can remember and as I've gotten older, I've been experiencing panic attacks. (Those are fucking scary. I thought I was dying.) I want to get connected with a therapist. Lately when I reach out to my friends, I haven't gotten the response or support I truly need. I don't blame them, I'm not sure they realize how bad it is. 

I just want to believe I can feel better again. There has got to be more to life than this. I don't want to live in fear and shame anymore. I can feel myself starting to shut out the people I love most so maybe someone unbiased here and help ground me.

My home base is in Ohio, USA. I am a student working towards my Bachelor's at an online school called WGU, if you've heard of it. I have been diagnosed with depression/anxiety before. Tried meds a long time ago and it was a terrible experience and to be honest, I don't like the idea.",18Feb2020,1

213,"About a year ago, I started feeling like everyone close to me was constantly giving me a hard time, or were criticizing everything about me. Now, whether they actually did this, or I was imagining the severity of it, I couldn't tell you. That's how it felt to me at least. This group includes my friends, and to a lesser extent, my parents and girlfriend. Ever since then, I have inexplicably caught myself trying to actively push everyone away. My friends in particular have always kind of been dicks, but, I have had nearly infinite patience with it until recently. 

I stopped talking to my friends very much at all outside of work, and I find myself getting angry whenever they invite me to do anything. The thing is, since I started pushing, everyone seems to be much nicer to me. My guess is because they realized what they were doing was causing them to lose me.

Sounds fine, right? Except now, my problem is that I can't interact with any of them without losing my cool at their attempts to be nice and friendly. I realized it was a problem when they invited me to go to a weekend event, and even offered to pay, and I told them no. The reason I gave is that I know I'd be grumpy the entire time and purposely ruin everyone's fun, and I don't want to do that. I'm sure we all know someone who just has to make everyone around them miserable all the time for no reason. I'm slowly becoming that person and I hate it.

It isn't coming from a place of depression or low self confidence. I know a lot of people who push others away feel like they don't deserve the love and affection, but that isn't the case with me. I also very rarely ever got annoyed prior to this. I think I just dealt with all the little jabs and criticisms for years, and eventually it broke me. I find I am happiest now when I'm by myself and everybody just leaves me alone. I'm an introvert at heart, but never to this extent of hating everyone around me all the time.

I do want to mention that both my parents and my girlfriend are amazing, supportive people, and are there for me more than anybody. However, I still catch myself getting frustrated with them for just trying to be nice to me. Essentially, nobody around me deserves how I'm acting, but I can't stop myself. I'm just so sick of everyone. I know it's completely irrational. Also, outside of interacting with the people close to me, or thinking about them, I am a very happy and friendly guy. So I don't quite think it's depression, but whatever it is clearly isn't healthy.

Has anybody else gone through these feelings? Any tips you can give me before I ruin all of my relationships beyond repair? 

I'd be happy to give more info if anybody has questions.",18Feb2020,1
214,"Warning. I reposted this because i really want a response.

I can't help but being angry/anxious/sac about every person i bound or even just tallk with. When i make a friend, i want all his attention to be focused on me. I want to make them laught. I want them to always be happy when being around me. I want to make everyone happy.

But when i see they are happy with someone else, they're closer and friendlier...smile more with them..I just want to scream. I want to cry at the same time. I'm not enought ? Am i annoying or boring ? What do i have to do to make them laugh ? That's the things going on my mind. If i can't make everyone laught at the things i say, i feel useless and ignored. I also feel jealous when i see my friends rushing into someone else other than me.

But the worse thing is when i saw them happy around someone without them havings jokes. Just talking. I can't do that. I can't just make people smile without jokes, if i don't i feel like they're bored of talking to me.

I also feel like i have to be the best at everything. If i do a work wrong, i want to throw it into pieces. But of couuurrse i can't do that ! So i just stop working. I can't even do a presentation in front of my classmate. Why ? Because i feel like what the others did is far better than mine, and i will just get to be ridiculised. So i just cried everytime, in front of the WHOLE class. It's humiliating. Plus, i'm the noisy type when i cry, so i get the attention of everyone.

I've had a period when i was cutting myself. But i know that i was doing that only for the attention. People didn't noticed me enought, so i throught maybe they will talk to me more if they're worried or..intrigued ? It's horrible, isn't it ? But when my best friend noticed my arm (it wasn't just some cuts, a part of my arm was RED because theyre was so much cutting. Like i've got attacked by some animal. I've cut myself to that point. But i'm the kind of person with a strong body who heal fast, so it desespeard now) she didn't tried to stop me. She just looked at it, confused, then didn't ask me any question other then ""You did this to yourself ?"". I was clearly not satisfied. So you can guess i'v made more of those right ? I even draw on my arm to attract people attention. Ahah , silly me, you didn't get a single student to notice you, but a teacher ! After that , you can imagine the ""talk"" with my parents. My dad was worried but couldn't do anything since i was just smilling, just giving him the things i cut myself with and giving him hints i wasn't going to say anything. Remember, i never had a serious talk in my life, i didn't know how to express my feelings. Even today. And my mother was angry. I guess angry that i was smiling, she must have tought i was thinking of the whole situation as a joke...after all, i always joke !...After that , i've lost faith in this solution, who given too much problem to handle.

Except that, cutting myself was also a way to take out the stress. Honestly , it work until my teacher fund out, and the problem who follow that made me stress even more, so i just didn't wanted to deal with it anymore.

After that is when i really started to...losing my head ? I've always been a person who enjoy life and draw as a hobby before i started to want more and more attention. In fact, i crave for love and affection from eveyone ! I never see someone truly trust me. I never felt trusted even tho i knew some people do. I want to be loved by everyone. I need constant love even tho i wasn't abuse during childhood or anything. But i know i'm a toxic person. A person who think about herself all the time and all the way she could get attention. I want to be the ""cool"" person in a group a friend. I'm willing to do anything, but when i'm pointed out, i feel like screaming again.

I don't know whats wrong with me, my sister told me it was just a phase. Even today, i think about every possible ways i could get attention, all cutting myself was feeling so great back then cause i still missed it beside the problems it got me, the ways i could be more loved and praise by everyone. To the point where i didn't think once about my future or what i will become.

But you know what ? The thing funny in this story, is when i don't talk to people, when i'm alone...i feel good. When i don't have to worry because i won't see anyone for a long time, i feel good. In fact i love lonelyness. It's just when i go to school i feel like i can't stand to be lonely suddenly. I love being lonely at home but not at school. At school i have to make people laugh every single minute to not feel bad. When i'm alone, i don't care about anything else, i just feel relax.

..Of course, i'm only 15 and i know i'll be in the study thing for a looonnnng time...but i don't know if i can make it in life like that. I've considering taking my life..No in fact i've plan to do it for 2 years now. I know that with the stress of the exam i won't make it. Everyone is serious in this period, and it's an NIGHTMARE. If they're too serious , how can i make them laugh ?...I want to punch them at the same time for making me feel like that,i'm so miserable i want to cut myself to the point were my arms are red and bleeding just so all the stress can go fuck themself....I want me to be a child again, where i was just funny and happy all the time without having to make effort.

Just help me, i don't know if i can continue like that, i feel like i could explode anytime by taking the knife and just stab myself...I've never tought once about my futur, only all the ways i could end my life, or how it would go horribly if i make it into adulthood. When i tought of end it all, i always smile. EVEN KNOW !! Talking about this make me smile !!",18Feb2020,1
215,"The feeling of emptiness.

What else is there to say, it's just a hole inside you that makes you feel huge discomfort, sadness and frustration. You try fill it up with thing's that you previously loved, and yet, they all seem boring, bland, unsatisfying. You are searching for that one more rush or that one change in your life that would click the emptiness away. But, it never comes, and you grow bitter day by day, either wallow in your own pity or drown in your ego. Sometimes you just wish you had something or someone, but realizing that you neither can get it nor keep it, keeps you away from ever attempting, and exhausting yourself even further. How can one be so exhausted and yet fail to fall asleep. How can one seek help and yet dismiss all the ideas thrown at him because they all are a cliche, some pretty words spoken in not so pretty world. How can one have dreams and yet no hope to achieve them. 

I don't know anymore, I want to have someone who would just communicate, not try to fix everything, not try to make himself look good. I want to just share what I had going for the day while he shares what he had going for that day, share interests and idea's and yet I don't have energy for that, I am tired of committing to people, I just want to do things together with 0 expectations of another person being there 24/7. I want to stop constantly feeling like I am there to provide entertainment.

I want to do everything that I need to be done by this weeks end, finish all the almost complete and not started works just so I could have 1 day of peace. But even with things done, peace never comes and I never do what I am supposed to.

I just want to stop feeling that shit of a black hole that is inside my head and stomach. I sound so stupid, and used so many clitches to describe thing's. I am generally fine but I don't know how to be more then fine.",18Feb2020,1
216,Ever since 7th grade I couldn’t see myself graduating high school now I’m a sophomore and I realize why I saw nothing it was death. I’ve been suicidal for almost 4 years and I don’t think I’ll be able to stay in this world by the end of this year.,18Feb2020,1
217,Ok sorry for the memey title but this is going to be me over the next 3 days. I'm in the worst mental state I've ever been in and I have to pretend nothing is wrong because it'd upset my mentally ill sister. Idk how I'm going to cope when I can't feel anything except for a deep sadness and intense fear.,18Feb2020,1
218,"I don't know exactly where I'm going with this post but I need to put it out there. Sorry ahead of time for errors as I'm typing this out on mobile!

So I (20m) have gone through some tough years. Long story short, moved when I was just getting into high school, did something stupid, and dealt with it. I am super sensitive to other people's hurt. Even my girlfriend (20f) jokes about how I'm so gentle and concerned in every aspect of my personality. I've never been the one to joke around all the time because I don't like tearing down others. Because of this I've become a very supportive person and am so much happier than I used to be and no longer isolate myself and have found some awesome hobbies!

But my biggest struggle is that now that I'm starting to find my place just in the world, I don't know how to handle all this hurt that goes on around me. My parents for example (47f and 56m) aren't divorcing but they're separating for the time being to figure themselves out so my brother (22m) and sister (17f) are going to have to move with them as our parents are both finding new places to live. On top of that my brother (22m) is beginning to transition MTF. Even more recently a close friend broke her leg and is really struggling lately and just went off the grid to improve her mental health and become happy on her own.

Where do I find the balance of making my life a priority without spreading myself too thin supporting those people close to me (there are others but those are just bigger pieces of the puzzle lately)? I'm personally taking a break from college to work for a little to make sure that I'm financially more stable as my living situation is a bit more complicated with my parents both moving (I'm sticking with my dad and my siblings are going with Mom).

TL;DR life is a little crazy, how do I balance focusing on myself and my happiness without forgetting empathy and being there for those I love and want to support?",18Feb2020,1
219,"So I'm in a period of extreme stress at the minute because of school and I've increasingly found that I sort of believe stuff that isn't necessarily true? I'm aware that the thing is not true but I can't stop thinking it. I *feel* like it is true even if I know it isn't. 

It has never been anything extreme and all the things I do/have believed are within the realms or normality. However it's still scaring me because I feel like I might start believing more extreme things. 

An example is today I had the thought that I was going to go to Manchester university next year. The thought felt extremely vivid, almost like it had already happened. I *felt* certain of it, like it was date or destiny. Now here's the thing: I have not applied for Manchester university and really don't like it there. In my head I knew it wasn't true but my emotions felt like it was if that makes sense. 

And the other day I kind of had it where I felt like I believed in God even though I'm an ardent atheist. And it's like my brain was really frustrated because I know I don't believe that but it's like my emotions believe it? If that makes sense. 

Its sort of affecting my life because I have also come to the ""emotional belief"" that I will do really well on my exams at the end of this summer no matter what, even if I don't do any revision. This has made it hard for me to motivate myself to revise. 

So it's like my emotions are starting to believe things that are different to what my head believes. Its like my emotions have become sentient and just believe whatever makes me feel happy. 

I am really scared because I'm just believing things that aren't true and I'm worried I will start believing other, more serious things. Is there a word or disorder that describes what I'm feeling?",18Feb2020,1
220,"I know it sounds weird but recently I made a YouTube channel as I have been injured from playing football/soccer for 11 months and thought it was about time I got a hobby. I enjoy making videos and over the time of my injury my dad also passed and since I’m 15 and even have my GCSEs coming up it’s not very good on my mental health. Also my injury effects my hormones, vitamins and minerals and causes pain and aching in my wrists, neck, legs and back. It may be getting better but who knows.

Anyway whenever I think about my YouTube channel I get a stress headache. I feel a bad, negative feeling (not sure what) and I feel madly guilty. This happens quite a lot but is a lot stronger when thinking about my YouTube channel. Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this or improve it? I would be very grateful
Also I would like to add that my thought sometimes clash each other, like I love something and I hate it at the same time, and I want my channel to grow but really don’t.

But anyway. Does anyone have an idea to fix or improve this?
Thank you very much",18Feb2020,1
