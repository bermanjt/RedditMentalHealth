0,"I recently found out that I have depression. I already suspected so the last 6 months until I arrived to a point that I wanted to end my life. 
I'm not alone, I know that. I have a family and friends that love me and I love them without limits too, but I want to stop feeling the way I do. I don't want to feel anymore the way I do. Lost, not worth it.
I had a difficult abusing childhood. I am 27, finishing my physics master and I achieved to be independent even thoug my father was telling me, since I was 9, that the only thing I'm gonna be is a s**t. 
I can't anymore. All days for me are black, without any warm feeling. I feel nothing. I feel a zero. A burden to the lifes of my family and friends. I feel trapped in a black hole and the only thing that I'm thinking every second is that the time that I'll say goodbye to this world is very close.",24Apr2020,1
1,"I am a introverted man who happens to also be born with cerebral palsy I have no friends or significant other to share my life with. The loneliness is beginning to eat me up inside especially now with this self isolation thing for the covid-19 I'm finding it hard to cope with, I spend most of my time playing video games or watching YouTube videos and Netflix to get through the day. I stay stuck in this apartment everyday I don't know how much longer I can go on for I'm feeling restless. Some days are better than others. I want to be happy but I don't know if I can be.

3,"So I have went through a lot in the beginnig of the year. I contacted child services because of my physically and emotionally abusive father and I cut him out of my life. It was really hard due to people not believing me or defending my fathers behaviour. I was in a lot of stress and my adhd got way worse. I couldnt stop fidgeting and having these moments were i didnt feel like my body could stop moving. I started hitting and slapping myself. My bestfriend who knew what I was going through stopped talking to me. I knew she couldnt handle all my problems (wich I never expected because shes my friend and not my therapist) and even though I always tried to not talk to much about what I was going through because I knew it was really hard on her, she just started distancing herself from me. For weeks she didnt even look at me. I then forced her to talk to me and she said she cant handle my ""outbursts"" (where i fidget and hit myself) and that its all just very hard on her. I apologized for burdening her and said that id be more thoughtful of her. It still took a few weeks for our friendship to be normal again and I was affraid to mention anything to her. I was trying to surpress my adhd and stop having my moments even though it was really hard for me and I always just tried to leave the room we were in. It's been a few weeks of quarantine now and I am currently rethinking the whole situation. I kind of think she's a really shitty friend. I know that the whole hitting and slapping myself could've been to much for her but instead of telling me she just ignored me for weeks. She basically told me that my problems burden her to much and kept nagging me about therapy and expected me to process everything in a couple of sessions. I felt ashamed of my adhd and hated myself for something I couldn't really control. Am I overreacting? Was it normal for her to have reacted the way she did? Am I expecting to much? Please help",24Apr2020,1
4,"I'm not sure of exactly what I'm looking to fix yet, but I would like to learn more about what is wrong that I may not have noticed. Like my childhood wasn't that great, but I can't identify all the specific things that were wrong with it or how to prevent repeating those things in my adult life.
I need help identifying toxic behaviors and personality flaws. Also how to realize when I'm being gaslighted (gaslit?) and how to be more confident in my perception. Or how to deal with that at all.
Also anger management for myself, and dealing with irrational/misdirected anger from my partner.
Maybe some resources for dealing with a loved one with alcohol dependency?

5,"I feel guilty for not getting things done. I feel unmotivated, unproductive, uninspired, inattentive, fatigued, ect. I've been working on getting my life back together before this pandemic. I was going to GED classes 3 times a week plus tutoring 1 day a week. Studying more often, and had a decent structure, routine, and sleep schedule. My classes have been canceled and I learn and study best in class environments or the library. I can't go to either. It's difficult for me to focus and I feel terrible for it. I've been studying for 20 minutes every 3 days but I feel it's not enough.  I feel like I'm lazy, unproductive, and doing nothing with my life. 

How can I stop this overwhelming anxiety? I have bipolar disorder so structure and routine are extremely crucial for me, but I'm unsure how to make one myself. Does anyone have ideas they can share? or words of encouragement?",24Apr2020,1

I used to do my work in cafes and libraries. I can't do that anymore. The only space I have to work is my bed. In a room that's horribly messy and cluttered. And sitting on my bed hurts my back. My space makes me so anxious and with hoarding tendencies and a controlling (also hoarder) mother who won't let me get rid of some of MY old stuff, I don't know what to do.

I've been getting really anxious to the point where I get this overwhelming feeling and my heart starts beating really fast, I have trouble breathing, my hands start shaking, I get hot flashes and I literally feel like I'm going to pass out and it's the scariest thing ever and I don't know why that happens. I don't see my purpose in life anymore and it got to the point where I thought about suicide and I felt so guilty because my life isn't that bad compared to others and I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this way but I can't control it. I know that I won't actually do anything but I'm constantly having thoughts about hurting myself and no matter how hard I try they won't go away. I don't really have anyone to talk to and I can't tell my parents because they would most likely yell at me and tell me that I'm being selfish.

9,"(18F) My parents make me feel like I have to hide things. And even tho they say I don’t, every time a share something, it’s like a hit to my face.

Even simple things like telling them the potato’s don’t taste good have become and issue.

I’m an adult but I feel like I’m still a child in there house, I can’t be open or share things with them, it’s like ever my leap of faith ends with me plummeting to the ground.

10,"This is just gonna be a rant and probably not very intelligible as I'm struggling these days to Express what's actually going on in me. 

First off I am constantly thinking of suicide. That's not unusual for me or even that big of a deal. Suicidal ideation =/= as having a plan (as we all know) and I dont really have a plan. I have a dream of just running away from it all. 

Theres an island I can escape to where all I have to do is put in a couple hours work a day and then live for free. Seems like a no brainer but it's obviously not that simple. If I go there I become a drug user. That's the real price and for all my flaws it's not one I'm willing to pay. Not yet anyways. 

I currently live with my gf whose daughter stays with us part time (2 on 2 off). Its a really good situation in general but for the fact that I'm currently not capable of being any more than a person that needs to be taken care of. It is stressing her out. she needs a parter rn, not another child in the house. We were in a distance relationship before covid but when I couldn't afford to pay the rent anymore she let me move in with her. I dont think she really knew what she was getting herself into. 

Last couple days have been rough. Really rough. I take adderall for ADHD but it's also the only thing that helps with my depression and the accompanying symptoms. Problem is that now I've become addicted and if I dont take them for even one day I experience extreme depression. I usually run out of my script before I can refill It cause i take too much. It's hard having something that makes you feel normal without abusing it. 

This obviously has a hard effect on my gf. I told her about it she knows... shes amazing... she's naive. I know that I'm not likely to get better any time soon and I dont think she should have to put up with me but where do I go? 

I have a few options for living arrangements but nothing ideal. Nothing is ever ideal. I dont know what to do. I'm seeing a counselor and have an appointment with a psychologist next week. I am not optimistic. 

Then it just circles back to running away from it all and ending my life. It's a comforting thought that I have the power to end all my pain and suffering with one stroke of a blade.

Nothing makes sense anymore. Theres no purpose to my life and I only seem to bring pain to the people around me. 

I know you can all relate and that's why I'm here. 

Update: The above is what I was going to post two days ago. I copied it to my clipboard and forgot about it till now. 

Below is the now. 

I blew up this morning after an argument  and left my gfs place. I am Staying away from there (for everyone's sanity) until I've had an appointment with my DR to try to figure out what to do about all this. That appointment isnt until the 29th and if I cant get my shit under control by then I'll likely be homeless and living in my car. I have options as mentioned above but none of them are viable long term solutions. My best bet is to try to work things out with my gf (which is what I WANT and that distinction is important here) but I really scared myself today. 

My gd and I got into an argument (I can provide greater detail in comments if requested) and I just completely lost control of myself. I flung the front door open and it slammed into her (she was kind of standing behind it in the laundry room), I then threw my stuff out the door, went outside and slammed the door closed behind me. I didnt intend to hurt her. I grabbed my stuff and started off down the road. She pulled up soon after and had me get in, then drove me somewhere to talk. I wasn't ready to open up and just wanted to get away from the situation. I kept telling her to take me to the hospital to which she replied that I was overreacting. In the end i told her I didn't want to be here anymore and she just said ""ok then"" and drove back home and gave me her car for a couple hours so i could be alone. She thought I meant I didn't want to be there with her, I was speaking in a more absolute and general sense. 

Anyways. 

I went for a drive and made a few phone calls to friends and family. I also called the hospital to ask what the fuck I should do cause normally when things get this bad I'd go to the ER to see a doctor/get committed. They told me that while hospitalization is still an option if I am in crisis, it's really REALLY bad in there right now due to covid. If they decided to admit me I would essentially be confined to my bed (shared rooms) for the duration  of my stay and I just cant do that. It would be like being put in isolation and so I decided I'd take my chances on the outside. The nurse did give me some resources to follow up on and I assured him (to put his mind at ease) that I didnt have a plan to end my life. 

I guess that wasn't really a lie either. I fucking *FANTASIZE* about ending it all, and I know how I would do it if it came to that, but I know that I'm not quite there yet too.

So here I am on a ferry back to my hometown with my bike and a few possessions. My car is (hopefully) still waiting on the other side... it's been 3 weeks since I parked it I have no idea if its gonna start or if it's even still there. Brought my bike just in case and I have a bike carrier in the trunk so no complications there. 

I guess I'll go see my brother tonight and then head to my moms for a day or two while I try to figure out a longer term solution. 

I'm really scared, I've lived in my car before but that was when you could do things like shower at the public pool and hang out at the library for wifi n shit. 

Ok I'm out of steam. Sorry for the formatting I'm on mobile.",24Apr2020,1
11,"I still remember the worst I’d ever felt, and if I was asked to explain depression is, that night is how I’d describe it. Except all that I can recall are these dark muted colours and my bedroom at 3am. Every terrible memory and dark thought had seemed to merge into one huge monster but at the same time all I felt then and all I remember now about then is... nothing, (and yes, at the same time I felt overwhelmed too). Yes, I know nothing is too simple a word. Hollow. Void. Vacant. Meaningless. Worthless. None of them ever describe how it feels. 

Once I tried to explain it as if there’s no one there, just the shell of a body and the soul has gone on vacation. But the vacation went terribly wrong when you were least expecting it, the flight home gets cancelled and you’re stuck away from home with no relief.

The night I felt my lowest, I had spiralled so low that even the very next morning I couldn’t begin to fathom that humans were ever capable of feeling what I did the night before.
 
I know this sounded pretty grim, but I wanted write this to say (you guessed it) please speak up. When I look back, every time I felt the lowest, I felt the loneliest too. If you can’t find a friend to chat to (or are to scared to), you can chat to me. It doesn’t even need to be about mental illness. We all need someone to talk to while we’re all so distant.

15,"We are supposed to have the house appraised tomorrow and my mom has been switching between so many moods like sadness, anger, and anxiety. Just a few hours ago she could see something was wrong and asked if I needed a nap. I didn’t and went to clean the house and garage and now she’s honestly being a bitch. She’s trying to blame her bad evaluation at work on me, not the fact that she has never worked from home before and she’s having trouble adjusting. I realize that it’s hard for her with a bad hip and knee and with her anxiety with a dirty house. She has arthritis and it’s painful a lot. It’s hard for her to be in the middle of an almost three year long divorce with her abusive husband. It’s hard for two of her biological children to be jerks and dislike her. It’s hard to deal with the remaining child who has problems and really can’t focus their attention on anything. Everyone wants to focus on her and how I “should be doing more for her”. I really try. I love my mom but it’s hard to deal with things like this in times like these. My three biological brothers want nothing to do with me. One of them used to hit and attack me and it was not normal sibling rivalry. My father doesn’t truly love me but he does what he thinks is love to him. I miss him dearly and long for a father figure to love and care for me. I don’t try to be rebellious and ignore what my mother asks of me, I honestly get distracted I was diagnosed with ADD when I was half the age I am now and my doctor put it as ADHD so I think they just group it under the same thing.

This is really annoying since I can't avoid people's achievements. I have to live with the fact that the world does not revolve around me.

17,"18F USA, I’m still living with my parents and I have no clue how to find help in any form. I’ve talked to multiple friends about it and all of them started getting help when they were minors so their parents helped them through it and I can’t get the courage to tell my parents about my problems because they’ll make me feel terrible. They’re both mentally ill as well which makes it seem like they’d understand more, but they can’t seem to take a hint or give me any type of empathy. I rarely leave my room and I barely eat, I am anxious constantly and I’ve had anxiety attacks (I believe they are) in front of them and full crying episodes and they don’t do much to help.

For whatever reason he didn’t put it on the book, just stated i do have a mood disorder as he didn’t want it to effect future possibilities. My doctor has given me several different meds but lithium is what seems to work the best with no side effects, I am currently taking 900mg. Here is my problem... I’ll have been told I have several different “personalities” I don’t ever see the difference, I may be very rude for a few weeks, then super kind, then reckless , then sad, then overachieving, and then back to kind etc.  I don’t even know myself at this point. I feel very negative about myself. My ideas seem to always be denied. I’m basically told (in a kind way) that I’m terribly hard to deal with, and I’m a very wushu washy parent. I don’t know if the meds are working or not. I don’t know anything. When the doctor asks me what I’m experiencing I’ll say I’m sad or irritable but I can never remember the details. I hate journals. I feel like it will be found and I’m judged. Actually.. that’s happened. 

I’m 35 and I feel a little like I’m 16. I have very bad detail oriented skills and I’ve lost my job twice. Currently laid off just before this virus went crazy. 

I know I need to call the doctor. It I wasn’t sure if anyone else experienced something like this. 

Not suicidal,  it I’m totally fine with death (besides the fear of it happening if that makes sense) I’m not overly depressed l, I think. I don’t know. Just need help lol, I kept this super general. Partly because of my damn memory and also because of time.

24,"Little back story 

My family growing up was basically my Uncle, Mum,Grandad, Nan and nans Husbad (nan remarried).

Other than that there was my dads mum and dad but they didn't bother alot and the rest of my dads side didn't at all as my dad abandoned me at birth.

Recent years I had my pets and have my boyfriend of 5 years.

2009 my uncle died 

2010 we got my puppy Eden 

2013 the year my mum got cancer and my one cockateil Tallulah died which upset both me and mum.

2015 mum had the all clear and I got with my current partner 

2015 Dec my partner cheated on me

2016 me and my partner got back together 

2017 my mums cancer cam back but in her lung

2018 my nan died while my mum was undergoing treatment 

2019 jan my mum lost her battle the day after my birthday I later had a massive brake down and had to be put on new meds 

2019 a few months after mum died near the end of my brake down my Dog Eden died , Eden had a condition called cerebellar ataxia he was lucky to of made it passed 1yo but having so much time and car for him made our bond even stronger. He doed

2019 few months after my dog died my grandad died of a undetected heart issue with caused a fatal heart attack we missed saying good bye by 20mins.

First Christmas with out my entire family my dads mum didn't even call to see how I was I later found out later from a member of her family that she hadn't bothered with anybody because of her new boyfriend and she'd basically ditched everbody with out a care like we were all nothing. So I cut her off as she was on thin ice anyway for some stuff but that did it.

In cutting her off though it means I've lost contact with my dads dad too as she does all the communicating for him.

Also me and my nans husband don't get on he genuinely isn't nice.

So as you can see all of this has gone on I did have mental health problems from 7yo they got worse when I was 14 and all of this had been the icing on the cake for me.

The part I struggle with lately though is one people don't understand and it's crushing me.

I have really been missing my dog Eden . My partner gets it but others just give me that look like I'm stupid or I get the ""he was just a dog "" talk  or the ""hes at peace now"" talk like I'm been daft. 

If you are a pet parent then you will get this pain but if not I will explain it as eden was my world he was my rock and he anchor that got us through the worst days.

Each time I get upset like now it feels like I'm breathing in glass the pain is too strong to hold on

The only reason I stay alive is my boyfriend, my cockateils sasha who I've had since 2008 and pippin who I've had since 2014 and my hamster gabriel who keeps me going too . And the thought of if I do something dumb how those around me like my partner and his family and my friends will feel.

But each time I brake like today it get harder to cope.

Today I broke when we went on a walk and we went on a field we took my dog to once. We didn't mean to go to that field but our random wall got us there. I saw the bench we sat on with my dog and my mental health crumbled from the pressure of grief.

First hit the reality our baby eden has gone hes never gonna get to play in that field again or sit by us on that bench and then the thought soon will mark a year since grandad  and eden died and then the realisation they are all gone and not coming back.

Some days I'm ok others I can't cope but the days I can't cope become harder and harder to fight.",24Apr2020,1

I myself have struggled with chronic anxiety/OCD since I was a child. I was sexually assaulted as a kid so I relate to her in a lot of ways and I think I help her to feel better when I talk to her. Of course I didn’t mind letting her talk to me about it for the first couple of months. I honestly felt like I could help her get through it since I have been there before. I keep recommending her to go to a therapist (I have been since this started) but she will not go even when her dr. recommended it. I even told her I would go with her. I know it isn’t for everyone and I respect her decision but it seems like every time I talk to her now she always brings it up. I don’t want to be a bad friend and I want to be there for her, but the problem I’m having lately is that it is triggering my past trauma.

I'll give examples:

The other day I broke a bowl and I started screaming, cursing, hitting the kitchen floor and pulling my hair

Just a few minutes ago I got mad at my math homework and scratched my arm and pulled my hair (my arm is still red and in pain) 

A few months ago I got mad while doing my makeup and hit my desk until my hands were red 

Just in any situation where I'm very angry I often pull my hair or hurt myself in other ways. Im only 14 years old. My parents did argue alot when I was younger but that mostly just made it so I am very sensitive to yelling. I have seen my dad get angry alot as well and he has punched walls before but I was never there to witness this. Is there any reason i hurt myself so much when i get angry? And is there a way to control myself better? (I've told my doctor I have anger issues and they suggested therapy, but my mom says I don't need it- I have never told her I hurt myself when angry, she often does not listen to my problems and tells me I'm just being needy or over reacting) 

If you can help me with this issue please do. I don't want to seriously hurt myself some day. It's never gone past pulling my hair but it worries me knowing how mad i get",24Apr2020,1

Since the shelter in place order, I have been trying to be in more contact with friends from home. I feel like whenever I reach out I am blown off or they are busy with something else. I never want to push myself on anyone or explain how I am feeling because I am stubborn in fixing my own problems, but I am really struggling right now being away from everyone during this crazy time in the world.

With everything going on in the world, I have not been able to find a job. I am home where a lot of negative feelings were sprouted. And I have been talking to a guy for a few months who out of the blue started ignoring me. My mind has been a mess and overthinking 24/7. I have trouble sleeping and I don’t feel like doing anything in the day. My parents must notice that I’ve been off, because they always ask if I’m okay. I just perk up real quick because I don’t want them to worry about me and I’m not really wanting to talk about it with them either.

I’d also think that I’d already woken up, brushed my teeth, walked around my apartment, then in an instant I’d just be in bed like i had been the whole time.

32,"I live with my Mom, she's 65 and has Type 1 diabetes. My job is reopening on May 4th with a bunch of new safety precautions and I feel like I need to go back, because it's my source of income and I have health insurance through them. I'm 24. I can't keep living with my Mom. Especially not during a pandemic. I am just a risk to her. My Mom doesn't want me to go back to work. She wants me and my sister to live off her social security check, which isn't reasonable and I don't feel right doing that. I'm afraid I am going to dig myself a financial hole and my mental health will deteriorate if I quit my job. And I really just feel I need my own space at this point in life in order to really grow. My goal is to move out by the end of summer.

I can't make up my mind. One moment I am convinced I need to go back to work, because I need to keep a steady source of income and save for when I'm ready to move out. On the other hand, I have some saved in the bank now and think, I could just try to live off that for the next few months, and try to go on Medicaid. That'll mean over a month without seeing my therapist, which a part of me really feels I need at the time, but another part of me thinks I could handle it. I have tools I can use. But that might leave me with a start I guess, but not enough money to move out in the foreseeable future at best and then I won't have a steady source of income for proof when I do want to move out. And idk how I'd get another job. I can't go out and find one, obviously, that'd negate the whole point of even staying home to begin with, and I've looked around quite a bit, and can't seem to find a work-from-home job that doesn't require either a degree, more experience than I have, or technical equipment that I don't have, that I feel would ever be a steady source of income. 

My head is spinning. I'm afraid of living off my Mom and ending up in another situation where I feel trapped, even more trapped than I do now. But I'm even more afraid of infecting my Mom, the guilt I would feel from that? I would feel like I might as well have murdered her. But I'm neurotic as fuck, if I went back to work I would take every possible precaution. The only thing I'm worried about is people not following social distancing and getting in my space before I can realize it. 

I don't know what to do. I can't think very clearly about this, I have so many thoughts running around in my mind they're all knotted up. I'm having trouble just organizing what I'm writing now. I hope it makes sense to whoever's reading it. All I know is that I don't want anything to happen to my Mom, I've been losing my mind worrying about her getting the virus and we've been quarantined for the past month. But I'm also ultimately afraid of my mental health getting worse being broke and living off Mom without a way out.

I can't think straight at all when this happens and it's really getting more frequent as the days go on.

Tried to commit suicide a couple of times via pills just to feel terribly guilty afterwards, got tremendous headaches and felt worthless for no reason at all. Is something I don't want to share with my paternal family because they (especially my stepmother) say that since we're on a familiar social circle I have no right to feel anxious or whatsoever so I've opted for isolating myself from time to time and letting everything consume me. My friends aren't an option either as I really don't want to bother them with the same things over and over again.",24Apr2020,1
36,"When I look back at so many memories, they're all tainted with negatives. After I had my children, that has mostly changed, but I look at myself from my earliest memories, and even so many recent ones and I hate myself.  I dont like the way I acted, or I remember the sting if the negatives. 

I remember being so hurt by so many things, and I can't invalidate the feelings I've had in the past, especially with my experiences. But I was so troubled, that I look at my life, and just think if how much I didn't like myself.

When I was a child, I remember my mother telling me how rotten I was - and how bad of a child I have always been. I think I internalized those things, and acted that way. I was a horrible kid, and if I didnt already feel that way, I was told I was, too. Our relationship has never gotten any better. I know that now that we are separate, and I have  my own life and children, she (mosty) holds her tongue, but I have always seen myself that way. Bad. Disappointing.

 I disappoint and exhaust everyone, or so I feel. Even myself. I have done a lot of work in the past 10 years to make that not so - I don't ask for help as a single mother, I speak kindly, and do my best.  But when I look back at myself before, I can't have happy memories of my life. I am embarrassed, and want to burn photos from my childhood - I look at them and feel ugly, and rotten, and mean.

My heart aches. I wish I could go back and erase myself.  I think of all of those wasted years, and how infantile and selfish I was, and how I have been reminded that my thoughts are true. I wish I could get rid of these things, but the thoughts transcend into now, and I still can't help but feel like a burden on everyone in my entire life.",24Apr2020,1

She said she doesn’t want to be in anything near a relationship with me until I can talk to her in person, and I basically took that as breaking up with me forever. I know I deserve it (there’s no use trying to convince me otherwise because it’s true) but I cannot see myself getting through these next months like this. I want to kill myself so I don’t have to feel the pain of knowing she’s happy with someone else, like she deserves. I want to kill myself so no one else has to interact with me for another second, so no other girl will ever like me and get hurt by me and start the cycle all over again. I hate myself so much more than I’ve ever hated anything and I know I deserve this pain but I cannot take it anymore. She is literally so amazing and beautiful and I just can’t grasp the fact that she will be happy without me, and will share all the moments that made me so happy with someone else.

46,"I feel like my life has been put on pause, I can’t manage my time without a routine, and trying to make a new routine based on stay at home working arrangements is not working well for me. I had completely separated work and home in my mind since a few years ago as a coping mechanism of working too hard and burning myself out. I have taken that coping mechanism too far and have switched from someone who works themselves too hard out of anxiety to someone who procrastinates out of anxiety. It’s important for me to be in a designated work place in order to face the anxiety that leads to my procrastination head on and overcome it. That’s not a option now, and I’m tired of this rut I’m in. I want to pretend things are normal. 

I’m not sure whether or not this is a good or a bad idea.. I plan on waking up early and driving to the gym like I used to do all the time, exercise at my normal time but by taking a walk and pretending I’m doing it as part of a group... then driving home and getting ready for my day like normal, with the normal rush and normal sense of urgency to get the day started. I’m going to pack my lunch. Then walk to the bus stop. Then walk home, except I’m going to pretend home is work. And if I can manage to keep up the facade, I’ll walk back to the bus stop at the end of the day and come home, except now home is home.

And then came this quarantine, and I started spiraling back into depression, and I'm just constantly low and whenever I'm like that, I just tend to not talk to anyone, I just kind of try and fail, and I don't like texting but I try, I really tried... I can't explain how much it hurts to want to reply to a text, but no matter how much I want to I just don't, I just can't do it, and I'm sure it hurts the other party too, because they think I care, but I'm ignoring them for days, they must not understand it's unintentional, and I get it, it isn't fair to them. So here I am, 4 days before my bday, typing this post out of sadness because my 'boyfriend' broke up with me, because I couldn't text him enough.

I'm just so angry at myself and I wish I was better, I wish I was normal again so that I can at least have the confidence to try to get him back, but I know that even after this quarantine is over, i'll never get over this, and i'll never be fine again for a long while, i'll just have to be forever alone, because I don't want to do this to someone else.",24Apr2020,1

56,"Hi. I'm 26F, married with two toddlers, I'm 2nd generation Taiwanese, born and raised in Brazil. I've being struggling with severe depression and anxiety my whole life, literally my whole life.

When I was in first grade, I'd sit alone in the school patio thinking ""The world is so big, I'm just one person, I don't matter, I could die today and no one would care"", I spent a lot of time thinking, debating, calculating when was the right age to kill myself. (35, because I didn't want to die too young but I also don't want to get too old)

During puberty, my half-siblings were born and of course it got worst. I started trying to harm and kill myself, I developed OCD, and spent a lot of time locked in my room crying for no reason, I just felt sad, I didn't understand, I didn't know what depression was. And my mother, instead of helping me, she dumped my half-siblings on me, so I had to deal with school, depression and taking care of toddlers.

After graduating high school, I took one year off, and through a lot of thinking, I realized that my mother was the ""cause"" of all that. When I was smaller, before my mother met my stepfather, she spent most of her time working and at night she'd leave me and my brother home alone to go partying with her friends (this was until we were 7&amp;8 yo)

Then, came University, I chose to study abroad to stay away from my mother. Freshman year was ok, I was first in my whole department, but things started digressing. I cut my wrists a couple of times, talked to some friends, and I finally went to see doctors (Psychiatrist &amp; Therapist). Got diagnosed, and put on meds. Needless to say, the meds didn't work. Ended up dropping out and went back to Brazil.

When I came back to Brazil, I met my future husband. Things got a little better, I got pregnant... Twice. And I love my children to death, they are my everything. But I still have depression and anxiety. I'm always so anxious, I barely eat because I'm afraid there's no food enough for my children, even though our fridge and pantry are full. And I always thinking ""Am I a good mother even though I have depression, even though I want to die?"". If it weren't for my children, I'm 100% sure I'd have killed myself a long time ago. I feel so guilty for having depression...

I keep thinking about my children, but I still want to die. What am I doing wrong?",24Apr2020,1

Sometimes sounds get so loud even if it is at a normal noise level, it gets me mad and I just want this stupid loudness to stop. I am very confused why I get so angry?

I honestly am not sure if I , or what I am struggling with, even belongs here as I know it is minor compared to the fights many are pushing through with one here, but I’m not sure where else to go with this. For reference, I am currently going through some relationship struggles, and while I know there are subs that deal specifically with those matters, my real struggle is feeling alone right now and not having any where to turn to for help or just to express and unload the thoughts going through my head. While I know it may come off as toxic masculinity, the fact is that as a man I feel like I have little to no support group. I don’t have friends I can reach out to, as my entire life revolves around work or raising my family. In one I can’t unload on my coworkers and in the other is the very place I’m struggling at. I don’t feel comfortable enough to reach out to my immediate family, as some details are personal. Which leaves the only option left for help being counseling. Yet here I face a financial roadblock and while I know individuals have to make a living. I am not sure where or how I can pay and I can’t help but feel like I am just a dollar sign and not a person.

This all came to a crashing halt when the very next page was one asking for payment information. It was such a cold and dehumanizing feeling. I hadn’t even been contacted by a human or given any sense of reassurance or compassion. I know people have to make a living and that there is both time and money invested by the counselors in order be able to provide their services, but I just can’t help but feel turned off and demoralized.

63,"I’m in my Freshman year of high school and due to corona my classes are online. I haven’t struggled with my mental health that much, I’m raised in a good family and home. The issue is my motivation. This isn’t brand new either. Throughout this year I’ve felt my motivation slipping.

For example, homework. At the beginning of the year I was getting all of my homework done. But as the year went on I started to slowly lose motivation to even look at my homework.

I think a lot, and whenever I do something boring I space out, and I hate when I space out because I get sad. I don’t really know how to explain it but there’s just this feeling in my chest that hurts, so I’ve been avoiding working on my homework because that’s when I start to hurt.

Instead I do useless things, like watch TV or play video games or scroll through Tik Tok. Throughout this corona break I’ve tried so hard to work on my homework but I physically can’t do it. I’ve noticed that I’ve started to sleep for more hours than I’m awake. I wake up at like 2:30pm and instantly go on my phone in order to distract myself. 

The worse thing is, I’m starting to get stressed out because of the homework I’m doing. Now, not only am I distracting myself from being sad, but I’m distracting myself from being stressed too. It’s an endless loop.

At this point it seems impossible for me to do my homework. I can’t sleep well because of it anymore. I’ve been lying to my parents by telling them that I’ve been doing my homework this whole time. 

My older brother is this perfect, student council president, cross country manager, captain of math team, captain of forensics, best actor, captain in national junior honors society, 4.0 scholarship rewarding teen. My parents expect me to live up to him but I just can’t when I’m like this.

I have finally decided to give therapy another try, i can't live like this. i feel trapped inside my mind. I feel so bad for my boyfriend who has delt with this for 4 years. constant questions, did i do this wrong? is what i said to them bad? what did he say, how did he say it, how did the conversation go, is he mad at me? god im so fucking annoying i can't help it. Reddit has become an addiction for validating myself, 99% of my questions im not being unreasonable or crazy. Im so afraid of being controlling/ bieng a bad girlfriend that everytime i have an issue with anything i run to reddit to validate i am not crazy,  even shit that happened YEARS ago i will sit late at night obsessivley making posts and different accounts and thinking about the situation. I know its exaushting to my boyfriend to listen to, I feel so bad, he said its annoying but it isnt a big deal and he knows im working on it. but he also agrees i need help. I feel like such a burden to him, i have rheumatoid arthritis and am always in alot of pain and complaining to myself. i try not to complain often but its obvious to him when i am hurting, i ask for back rubs alot. he is a fucking saint and has always been so patient with me (obviously he isnt perfect) but he has never snapped at me for my questions or anything. i feel like he deserves better, i feel like i emotionally rely on him too much to make me feel safe i guess is the word. I need help, my relationship is just the tip of the ice berg with the issues this anxiety causes me, its compulsive as fuck.

She was my absolute best friend and the thing I loved most in the world. My heart is still absolutely broken and I miss her so much. I’m single and live alone and have been by myself through all of this. 

I’m doing my best to stay busy. I’m attempting the distance learning thing, exercising every day, going on walks, reading, having lots of Zoom calls with friends, playing video games, cleaning, and trying to stick to a daily routine. But some days are just so, so hard mentally even though I’m trying so hard. 

I don’t know how much longer I can live like this. I feel like every single part of my life has been stripped away...my job/students, my cat, my social life, sports, etc. I know there are bigger problems and I should be thankful I’m healthy, along with my family and friends.

67,"i didn’t know if post this to sex questions or mental health because I think it’s both but it affects so much how I feel about sex.

I never got assaulted or raped in my life, my first sexual experience was good and normal it was me 11 and my friend she was 12 we were both girls, she masturbated me and it felt really good, it was normal games girls do when they’re entering their teenage years, but lately I hate seeing porn where men are fucking woman, I despise it, it’s like every single human does it why is it so special??? It looks animalistic in my eyes, not appealing, I fear some men because when they’re horny they can be really mean and send dick pictures when you don’t want it and say things to harass you like “you need to get a good fuck”, I wonder if people realize their obsession with sex is so much that they’re acting like complete animals, and no I do not believe humans are just animals like some answers say. I believe we are more than that, the reason to live for this people is sex, sex and sex (and food maybe) but this sickens me is that all of our purpose to  fuck for a bit and then die? It’s sad af, I know it feels good for them but the obsession creeps me out and makes me feel like an outcast, I’m just 17 and never had sex with a man just had sex games with my friend from a young age. 

But now I can’t seem to get turned on by dicks! I can’t be homosexual because I can like men but I hate seeing dick pics, watching porn didn’t scared me when I was 13 or 14 why do I feel that way till now!?

I still feel totally embarrassed of myself pretty much all the time. It’s a strange feeling. Like, I genuinely don’t care how each person chooses to spend their life, like no judgement. But I am so mean to myself. I find myself wishing I was beautiful and for some direction. I don’t even catch myself being so hard on myself. It feels so natural. 
I started seeing a nice boy but my rape trauma is flaring up really bad so I broke up with him a month  ago. He was cool but really intense. The trauma is really lingering. It’s time to address it but I don’t want to. The issues I have with intimacy now almost feel like a blessing- I just wish they also applied to emotional intimacy.

“That’s awful. Don’t ever tell me that again”

And I was like haha yeah

It hurt YOU I’m sure

Like idk they all want to say I don’t have trauma that I’m  literally lying to my therapist to shock them, that I self harm because of peer pressure but man do you know how gross I feel? To be told I SHOULD be hated that I SHOULDNT be born

I wasnt a mistake

I was made with evil intent and I fucked up lives like

Cool ok sorry for being born I’ll try to kill my self and solve the problem

Everything that isn’t the normal child. I know my mom thought she wanted a kid but 

I don’t think she wanted one like this

And I spent my whole childhood trying to be the perfect child for them as if I always needed to make up for something

74,"I've been in love with this girl for two years. God knows why I still am, but it's as serious as ever. We only dated for like a month back in 2018, and have remained friends since. She's aware of my feelings for her. There is too much backstory to get into here, but it's posted on other places on my profile. The short of it is, she started dating this guy I used to be friends with. The relationship lasted (on and off, mostly on) for a year and a half, and she just broke up with him last weekend. He was a piece of shit who cheated on her, manipulated her and kept her in an abusive relationship for over a year. I was proud of her for getting out of it.

Now she's taken in interest in my best friend. They hung out twice and she already wants to date him. I cannot physically express the amount of pain this causes me, compounded onto the years of heartbreak. Now he's a great guy, I love him. I think they would be good together, my pain is selfish. But goddamn it if it isn't real. Before anyone says, I know how horrible and messed up our dynamic is, this is nothing to be angry over, but I am.

I'm not looking for judgement, I understand how selfish and self sabotaging this all is, I've been in therapy for years trying to work on all of this. But I'm jealous of this guy. He's extremely attractive, and never has to lift a finger to get a girl. I've never resented him for it, but I have been jealous. Even in his past relationships, when I wasn't horribly in love with the girl he was with. I can't and shouldn't control her, but I literally don't think I can take this blow. I've been teetering on the edge of my mental health lately and this will fucking haunt me.

I wish I wasn't so unreasonable, I wish I could let her go, I wish I could let them be happy, but I'm currently experiencing some of the worst pain I have ever felt, physically or otherwise. And this isn't the first time, the intense pain always lasts 24/7 for at least a couple months, then calms to a dull ache the rest of the time with small surges of anguish. I know I should cut her out of my life, I've tried many times, but that never stops me thinking about her. She is very suicidal and I'm the only person she can talk to about it. I'm just venting at this point, I've spent the past year doing every single thing I can to better myself, I workout and meditate daily, I go to therapy once a week (phone calls since quarantine), I got sober after some rampant drug abuse, I just want to see some progress being made.

I know I come off as a piece of shit for all this, but that's how I feel and it's eating me alive. Thank you if you read all this.",24Apr2020,1

And it’s like when I start to forget about it even more bullshit comes my way. Its virtually the same situation every time but it gets worse. I just want to know why my mind keeps going back to it even though I know it’s stupid? Why it leads to more self-depreciating thoughts? Another thing that REALLY bothers me is the fact that I try to push the situation away by saying “Nah I’m gonna be a real big success when I’m older” and imagine people (mainly the people involved in my problem) saying “wow he’s so great” or some shit like that. It can be different each time but basically they’re looking at me in high regard. It’s a weird coping technique that I kind of hate myself for having. I didn’t even realize the oddness of it until like a week ago. I tried to put it away but it helps a lot honestly.There are times where random things can trigger calmness in me. I could never put my finger on it but sometimes I could put a random song on and it helps me. Music can be a coping mechanism  sometimes but it doesn’t always help.

I'm on medication. I've tried reading philosophical and ""death positive"" articles and viewpoints. Only causes me more anxiety. I try talking with my family and friends. They sympathize with my anxiety but can't really help.


I feel like I am trapped in a jar that I can't escape, and at any moment a voice/my mind will scream and echo in the jar, ""you're gonna die!!! Imagine what that will feel like!!!""

I don't feel like I'm being heard or taken seriously, and it's a bit fair to be honest. I'm living on my mom's couch, and this July will mark 2 years since I had to move in with her. My doctor has asked me what I want to do with my life, and I don't know. I've given it a lot of thought, and I can't think of anything between the brain fog, memory problems, and crippling loss of interest in damn near everything. Both my mom and my doc have asked me, and neither can accept that I don't know. I know what I want, and I know how to get it, but I don't know what I want to do to get it. The US mental health system is fucked to say the least, and my doctor thinks it's amazing that I have a bachelor's degree, and that I clearly want a job just because. I've given up on getting through to my mom, but it still hurts when she points out commercials on TV about companies that are hiring.

And on top of that, my grandma fell last month, and we didn't find her until the next day. I'd been helping her around the house, and I recently stopped helping her. She's a lifetime smoker, and had given me 3 different excuses as to why she won't go outside to smoke. I know I didn't use the right words when talking to her about why it bothers me and why she needs to at least smoke outside, but part of me is still mad that she'd been using me. Yeah, she needed help those first couple of weeks, but she got used to it, and started expecting it of me.

Shes gotten professional help, and has isn't completely on her own.The problem is that I just feel like I need some advice on how to help when the situation calls me too without fucking up and making it worse.

I love her and I do my best, but I suffer from having the stupid. I know that her issues are not her fault, and I don't blame her for her problems. I just sometimes feel useless because I don't know what to do.

For some specific senarios: she texted me pictures of her drawing on her legs, and I was informed that this was a way to stop her from cutting. And felt soooooo underprepared to help. I did my best to calm her down and was successful, but I just need some solid advice on what to do so I can actually be helpful.

She's also recovering from anorexia. I try to make sure she gets something to eat every day, but again, I understand that that's something that she needs to work through at her own pace and I won't force her. Is that the right thing to do? Or should I just stfu?

Specifically it's a combination of 2 things. Perfectionism, and being insecure about my intelligence. When I was doing homework today. I was rushing it a little and not doing as well as I could because I'm not passionate about school or the topics I'm learning. But as I struggled and half assed things to just get the assignment done. I kept beating myself up because I wasn't doing as well as I could, and because I wasn't gaining as much knowledge as I could of from the subject, and because I felt like I wasn't an expert on the subject so I didn't know what I was talking about. This is hard to deal with because It makes it hard to enjoy life. I constantly beat myself up when I study or research things because my brain is fixated on the belief that I'm not good enough, or that I need to prove that i'm capable of doing these things in the first place. That I need to be perfect, and that I need to extremly well on everything. It doesn't leave me alone or let me make decisions for myself. Instead it pushes insecurities, and old habits down my throat and makes it impossible to relax. This is all really hard to deal with. And I just wanna be able to make choices by myself without always feel so pressured and stressed out. Please someone help me. I feel like everything I do is wrong.

I’m an 18 year old girl who’s childhood was just terrible to say the least, my teenager years were never better if not worse honestly, from spending my life in court rooms because of family issues to almost getting raped cuz my mother was too busy getting drunk when I was around 9, to being hospitalized because of suicidal attempts and abusive families.

I grew up in a household where my mom pinned my siblings against me by babying me and treating them differently. I never had friends growing up, so I never knew how to really act with friends and always stepped over boundaries because I was knew it growing up. I have abandonment issues, and been dealing with depression and anxiety. I’ve always just wanted friends, somebody that I can be there for.
I had a 5 year long relationship where he 
1. gaslighted me and used my hearing disability against me while doing so.
2. Pushed me hard into a closet door 2 months after major surgery (VSG surgery)
3. Punched me in the face for practicing funny voices in the car, when he could of just told me to stop.
4. Caused me to miscarry, physically by elbowing me hard (He didn’t want it, even if I was happy but scared of abortions)
5. Would constantly scream at me if I told him something I didn’t like

It’s been messing with me mentally, and makes me confused about my current relationship, but I know it’s in my head when I worry and I try not to let it affect my current relationship.

Right after my ex, I met a guy who I fell for, he only talked to me (I found out) because he likes finding chicks who are overweight and destroy more of their self-confidence. His ex, because I always wanted a friend and befriended her, but she used me for money, because I was that nice to help her out, and I ended up escorting, which I’m embarrassed about, because it only lead to me being raped by somebody who I didn’t know. That only happened in August of 2019, it’s still fresh.

He gave me two names, one for online, the other in person. He pretended to be a stranger and had me by the throat, and raped me in a ditch at 4am. I know those who are raped are given a bad name because of those who lied to hurt others, but I’m so scared for the trial that’s happening on May 7th.

Now I've finally found some peace in all this quarantine and ""stay at home"" stuff. It's okay if my life's on hold, because so is everyone else's. So what if I hate my job, I'm lucky to have one. Living with my parents is an advantage, I'm helping them with my income and I don't have to worry about rent payments. Who cares about relationships when you have to keep you distance. 

All the issues I normally worry about and beat myself up over are now strengths and positive aspects of my life. I feel good to have this new outlook on my current position and I hope I can carry it past the pandemic. To be fair this new outlook isn't all internally realized, I have a psychiatrist, therapist, and have medication for the Depression and ADHD.

Since I started taking birth control pills around eight months ago I've noticed a flair up of anxious and depressed moods.

I've done a little bit of research and although there is little concrete evidence to suggest a link to birth control there is a lot of anecdotal evidence to claim otherwise.

I never talk down to someone or tell them they’re wrong without saying “I understand, but...” and although I think that’s a strength, I’m afraid that it just disguised my weakness of getting into conflict.

I’m an actor and I face l my performances with great courage but I beat myself up for being anxious before the curtains go up. I ask why I deserve to be ana core when I feel so scared. Then I understand that having courage doesn’t mean not being afraid, but facing it.

I’m afraid that one day I’ll be in a situation that will put people I love in danger and my fight or flight will kick in and I will flee. I don’t see myself as that person but I fear the fact I won’t have control over knowing until the moment.

I am from a very conservative family with strictly religious parents who put me in an all-boys school from a young age and as a result, I've never had a conversation with someone from the opposite gender of my age. I was passionate about programming in high school and I worked very hard(I think) to try to study in my dream college and failed to do so with relatively bad scores in the entrance exams. Anyway, I joined a college in which I was eligible to attend with my scores and started studying Computer Science. And that was when I got introduced to Competitive programming. For those who haven't heard of it, it's a programming exercise that is often used by tech companies to hire people. 

I kept learning for this(new algorithms and stuff) and due to its competitive nature, I fell like I am always a step below from my peers. Whenever I fail to solve some problems in a contest, I go into a depressive rabbit hole and have suicidal thoughts running in my head. Whenever I tell my parents that I am depressed and I keep failing, they tell me to pray and be holy. This has further pushed me away from religion and I have gone in the opposite direction by picking up an addiction to pornography. All this failure has put thoughts in my head that I'll never be a good programmer or even a social human. This quarantine has made things even worse as I can't even meet the few friends I had.

117,"I am so sorry you are dealing with this. I'm just curious but are you a man or woman? Truthfully I am glad I logged on and this was the first post that I saw. I am feeling a little anxious and somewhat sad this morning. I have been working on my emotional health and what I have come to discover to be ""c-ptsd"" and the resulting emotional flashbacks.

I think the hardest thing about these processes and experiences... is that it is an everyday thing. I guess what hurts the most is the feeling of ""let down"" when, usually, by the end of the day I am feeling happy, achieved and hopeful (after having worked passionately all day reading the books I love, and creating and continuously updating and posting on my youtube channel...) that when I wake up in the morning, I start off excited and hopeful to restart my day.

But everyday, about an hour or so in the feeling of dread begins to sink in... The realization that I am not now ""informed and cured"" but rather I will be revisiting these harmful memories and hurtful experiences... again and again...

It really is an inspiring process! One that writing this now, I realize I should only be more and more grateful for! I guess the pain just sometimes comes from the realization that it is not all over. Every day I will be flashing back to memories that hurt the worst. Feelings that I deny the best. And emotions I never asked for or wanted or ever really even dreamed that I would have to feel.

...Anyway sorry for the dramatics!! lol this was more for me than for you (hahaha! :P) But I figured since you had experiences with an angry (apparently also violent... I am so sorry!) father... that you might possibly relate?

I dont really associate with having been a victim of physical abuse but I am wondering now if this is something that I actually need to reacknowledge and release....

I guess some of the feelings of sorrow comes from the fact that I have already written about these feelings once now... and I suppose I had that sort of childlike dream that having acknowledged them once would be enough... and that i ""faced it"" and it was all going to go away now!

Regardless, writing this now is I think what is going to really help me get through. I am thinking I am going to copy and paste this and apply it to maybe my own post or some other forums as well. I'd be interested in hearing other peoples responses to this and hopefully maybe also hear and/or offer their support! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 It sounds so stupid but stuff like this, it really just helps so much to know that we are not all actually alone!!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3

Please let me know if you relate or have any experiences similar. I think because I have been ""hardly"" physically abused... I always wonder if maybe I am just weak or somehow brought it on myself or like maybe it is just my fault... :'( I know this is not true but you know, you see football players and boxers and guys who take serious and repeated punches to the face and they make it... it seems anyway... appearing remotely unscathed...

And here I've been the victim of physical violence maybe only once or twice in my life and it seems like every morning and I am twitching and flashing back at the fear of coming forward about this :''''( I know that this is all for God's purpose and that acknowledging these facts and feelings will only help make me stronger so that I too can help people like myself and who have had it much much worse.

I would like to think that I am now releasing these feelings and that tomorrow will bring an easier, and more progressive day! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I know that I believe that everyday is going to bring a morning and emotional flashback that is just EVEN A LITTLE bit easier and that oneday I am going to get through this completely!!!

Ahh anyway I guess this is a prayer at this point. So thank you to loving and grateful higher power. That I hope to fully and completely embrace as my new and eternally loving and transformed self! (lmao...??!!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3)

Hey :)

So I am an Aussie uni student with a perfect GPA but I’m basically constantly on the edge of a mental break down.

I am constantly stressed anxious and depressed I have an extreme problem with perfectionism and even if I reach my goals (top grades at uni in all classes) I feel like either I should do more work, should do better or that I’m stupid because I had to do more work than my classmates to get the good grades. God forbid I am unhappy with a grade I lose my shit and have a mental breakdown and can’t function anymore.

It’s also other aspects of my life that my perfectionism really messes up include work, relationships and body image. If I’m not constantly doing something productive I feel guilty and like im a failure.

On top of all this I already have an anxiety disorder and related problems and am medicated for it.

I feel like I really need help because all the stress and anxiety is really getting bad right now due to uni and I just can’t cope anymore but I don’t know what to do.

I have been to 4 different mental health professionals, Including psychiatrists, psychologists and mental health councillors and while they were all good none of them actually worked.

I try hard in therapy and I do my best and I always go and engage and do the homework but it never really helps me as much as it should. One of the therapists told me that she can’t help me anymore and she doesn’t know why I seem to be getting better and suddenly go back to square one and said my anxiety was treatment resistant.

I don’t know what to do or how to fix this. I feel like a lot of it is related to the perfectionism but I have had it since I was a child and can’t seem to get rid of it and I don’t know what kind of therapy would work best for it?

Ps. I have tried DBT, CBT and some ACT for the anxiety",24Apr2020,1

I am 19 years old living at home with my mother father and 2 younger siblings during quarantine. I am an essential worker and still working. 
My mother began having an affair about 8 months ago. My father found out and it destroyed him mentally. He stopped eating and sleeping and became anxious depressed and contemplated suicide around christmas time. He confided in me and I supported him through all this, however he did not confront my mother, as she has been struggling mentally for a year now. A month ago, I confronted my mother as I saw how much my father was hurting. She claimed she didn’t cheat and at the time I had no physical evidence to prove she did. My father recently found a note hinting towards suicide written by my mother. He also found evidence of her cheating and plans on confronting her. I am petrified that my mother will not be able to cope with myself and my father knowing about her affair and that she will attempt to commit suicide. My father is also an essential worker so is not at home during the day. I have been trying my best to support both my parents during their mental challenges. I am afraid that my father will blame me if anything happens my mother (he is still in love with her and is happy to continue their marriage if she stops the affair.) I will also blame myself for pushing my father to confront her due to me worrying about his state of mind. A year ago I began to recover from chronic depression self harm and suicidal thoughts and cake off antidepressants before christmas and I am petrified that I will not be able to stay clear of such thoughts and stay positive and able to support my parents through their mental struggles.

This can and usually is followed by spikes of introspective, which can include but is not limited to questions such as: Am I a good or bad person? Am I wasting my life? Will I become fulfilled one day? Will my sense of anxiety go away? What is wrong with me? Am I going insane? Am I already insane?

COVID-19 has exacerbated it all. I just don't know how people in the world cope with all these potential issues that can interrupt normal life. What if I get cancer? What if one of my family members get cancer? What if people are starting not to like me? What if the environment collapses? What if a world war starts? What if my house gets burgled? I worry about my future, past and present in huge equal measures. I also reflect on many mistakes I have made in my life, big and small and sometimes are crippled by them.

130,"I moved in with my boyfriend and his grandma about a month ago for my better for my benefit, but it’s not like that at all. My boyfriend is an alcoholic and was 4 months sober. I believe that he’s been drinking again and lying about it when I ask. He is working so he will be tired when he gets home, but he’ll also be difficult to approach, eyes will be red and slightly droopy, slight slurred speech, and can barely walk straight or even hold himself up. He’s acted this way two days in a row this week and a couple times the last few weeks. 

His lying and blaming have increased. I ask him about drinking and he says no, but then I’ll find out he bought something. I confronted him and first he said he didn’t buy it, then when I said I don’t believe him because it’s on the receipt he admitted to buying it because it’s what he does during stressful times but won’t actually drink it. 

I have a messy past and when he gets upset he seems to bring up those points. Tell me I, “f**ked him over.” I should of done something sooner to resolve it, that he can’t have anything to do with me or my situations. But then after he walks away and comes back he tells me he loves me and didn’t mean to talk to me that way, but then it starts again. 

I have depression and anxiety. I’m seeing a therapist and after sessions I’ll get gloomy. I told my boyfriend how it’s normal after a session, he asked, “is this going to happen every time?” 
He’ll get upset about me “not being happy.” He’ll ask why I can’t be happy when he gives me everything. I can’t help having sad feelings every week. If I stick to a routine and keep myself busy I’m usually good, but it’s been more difficult and no matter what I say he won’t believe me.

I love him.

Last night it didn’t seem to end. He kept going about his hurt and the same things for almost 3 hours. He said I didn’t understand his pain otherwise I wouldn’t of caused it. 

There’s a lot of mixed messages. He will tell me, yell it, and even use a megaphone to tell me to leave, “just go.” Then flip to telling me to stay, but he won’t even look me in the eyes. He can’t hold a conversation. 

I miss the person I fell in love with. I know he’s the same person and is hurting and trying to heal through his old habits. I can’t and shouldn’t have to endure his aggression. I am scared of it.",24Apr2020,1

Yesterday I was full of life, fighting to be productive that day and by the end of it having a meal with my family was so hard i even started crying, i couldn't stand a word from them and it's 3 PM and i don't want to get out of bed, am crying and mind doesn't think of anything.

133,"famous people and financially successful people seem never satisfied with where ever they are. 

Trump for example is president but really cares what people think about him. He wakes up at 3 am and can't sleep because someone slighted him, so he fires off some crazy ass tweets.

Jimi Hendrix was like being the greatest guitar influencer was not enough I need to get wasted to just live with myself. 

Curt Cobain had it all and still blew his head off. That purse lady committed suicide, The famous chef.

You name it they all are struggling, and seem unhappy with just existing. 

I sometimes get pangs of guilt and sadness that I am not more successful. I do pretty good, but it never seems to feel like I am getting anywhere? I always wake up and think I should be doing MORE. 

I want to get back to being young and not caring or knowing that I was not great enough. 

Teachers from early on were like ""you could be so much more if you just applied yourself"" Putting the seed in my mind that what ever I am now is not good enough, I have to be more. Then I grew up and everyone compares themselves to me and judge my worthiness financially, or fitness wise or what I eat or how I feel about social issues. I really don't want to play that game, I never can win.

134,"This isn't what I thought my first post would be, but here we are.

I've been seeing a therapist for a while, I started back when my relationship ended last autumn. It was only a new relationship and it had a pretty messy start, but I loved him all the same. I just needed someone to talk through it.

It helped, and actually the man from that relationship came back wanting to work things out about a month later. I did too, so we got back together.

Everything was going so well until Easter weekend. He called me (because of the lockdown) and said we shouldn't see each other anymore. He had told his estranged/soon-to-be-ex wife that he was seeing me again and she didn't take it well, and started saying she wanted him back, which has messed with his head and he thought it best to end things with me. I'm really struggling with this, because I really believed him when he came back and said he was done with her, that I was the only thing that mattered and that it was me he wanted. I must sound like such an idiot....

It just feels like the future he had talked about with me, scary though it was to imagine that far ahead, I had just started to get excited about, and now it's been ripped away. He says he knows he's being an idiot, because there's nothing about our relationship that he doesn't want, and why would he give up something that gives him nothing but joy? I know that says more about his headspace than about us or me, but it still fucking sucks.

On top of that all falling apart, I'm on furlough from my job. I know that's a good thing in the wider scheme of things, but I'm a huge workaholic so I'm really struggling with this. I've tried establishing my own routine and being productive with online courses and stuff, but I just can't focus. I find myself waking up in the morning and forcing myself to go back to sleep because I just can't face there being that much time still left in my day. I really try to make myself do something, anything productive, but I just can't.

All of it, combined with being stuck in the same place, it's all just got on top of me. I know I can go for a walk and that it's good to get outside, but I just can't seem to bring myself to do it. Knowing that I'm so limited in where I can go, that I can't just get on a train or the tube, or a plane home to see my family, I can't cope with the monotony. I can't face it. I want to run away from it all, but I can't. I want to go to sleep and just wake up when it's all over, but I can't. I was on track for a promotion, a pay rise, increasing my team size, some incredible holidays, and turning 30 next month was meant to be a celebration abroad with my boyfriend. It's all gone.

I spoke to my therapist yesterday and broke down. He asked me if we could look at a scale, and he asked me some questions and gave me a score of 18. I don't know what that's out of, but he said it put me in the moderate to severe end of the depression scale. He said that, knowing me as he does, he would say that I'm probably moderate rather than severe, but still, it kind of shook me. I've never thought of myself as being depressed. I don't know what to do with it.

Everyone who knows me always tells me how strong I am, how I can cope with anything, how much I've achieved, and I'm so ashamed that they're all wrong. I mean I kind of flit between being okay, being able to chat to my flatmates and such, to just being so down that all I can do is sit in my room and cry.

I don't know what to do. I tried to call my GP to ask whether I needed to make an appointment, but they're shut. I called 111 and told them what my therapist had said and that I don't know if I'm meant to talk to someone about whether or not I might need medication, but I just feel so stupid and ridiculous and like I'm overreacting. They said they'd call me back and they have 4 times but I just can't bring myself to answer because I feel like such an idiot. Surely I don't need medication, it's just a bad time right? But then I think what if I'm not wasting their time? I don't know what to do....",24Apr2020,1

137,"My parents constantly are shoving down my throats that I should find a passion. They look at me like I’m a waste of life, an idiot that doesn’t have motivation. I have been struggling with depression for a while because I feel like my parents don’t support me, don’t care about me, only care about how I make them look. They say I make them look like failures. 

My dream and goal is to become an esports player and do what I love for a living. Some of you out there will call it a joke, I know, but it’s what so many people love doing and I see people making careers out of it and I have been working so hard to improve. Thing is, I go to a prestigious academy and my grades NEVER DROPPED, even if I dedicate so much time to games. My parents still live in the 80s. They say video games ruin lives even though the are making careers. They say that professional gamers are wastes of life. It’s all I hear. 

My parents think that my love, my drive for gaming is an addiction, a dumb thing, something getting in the way for what I really love doing. As soon as anything happens that they don’t like, they take everything away and call me a waste. That I don’t care about my life or my family. 

I feel trapped. I know what I want to do and I know the work I must put in to get there, but I can’t escape my parents. I am plummeting into depression, and I can’t go to my parents because they will blame it on games and my lack of motivation and caring for anything. I try to ignore it, but I can’t stop thinking about what they tell me and if it’s true, and if gaming is a waste of life and a leech of my motivation. 

I used to escape by going to school. But now even that’s gone. So now I’m stuck at my house with my parents that don’t believe in me. That don’t think I’m worth their while. That’s all they tell me anymore. I’ve packed my bags before and planned to bike away, as far away as I can get, chasing dreams and building a new life, but I know that won’t work. I need an education and I need a roof over my head. Some nights I genuinely want to die, to get my wasteful life over with. But I tell myself death isn’t what I want, I want to achieve in my life, get farther in my passion and goals. I want to prove my parents wrong.

For a short, wonderful month or so, I felt the best about myself than I had in a very, very long time. 

Then this virus thing happens and I'm stuck inside, and I have lost all motivation to do anything self care related. I'm back to eating crappy food, I don't exercise, and I've gained weight.

144,"*^(English isn't my first language. So, sorry in advance for the grammatical mistakes.)*  


I want to stay *anonymous*. So I'm using *pseudonyms*, I am **Adam**, *17*. She is **Eve**, *16*.  
First of all, we have been in a relationship for a bit over 4 months and in total I have known her for about 8.5 months.

She suffered from obesity growing up, she was extremely over-weight and suffered from a lot of health complexities while growing up. She spent a lot of time going in and out of the hospital as a child. That aside she was bullied and mocked for being fat from both outside her family, at school, and even at home. Most of the toxicity at home came from her paternal grandmother who used to live with them at that time (and she stayed with them even until the beginning of this year, so you can say she has been around Eve for around her whole lifespan). Also she is dark-skinned so racist comments have followed her around since birth.  


Both of Eve's parents are doctors. So while they are a lot open to her, Eve had missed a lot of the parental presence that other kids get.  


Despite being doctors her parent's did fail to educate her about safe distance and other things a kid should know, also because of being very busy her parent's used to let her be taken and brought back from school by  one of her her father's staffs. The manimal that used to take her to school and bring her molested her continuously for two years from second grade. She also got almost raped as a child by another guy and got literally saved seconds before getting raped. One of her earliest memories is being fingered by a manimal. She also has vivid memories of the abuse.  


Anyways her life sucked as a child, she'd wake up, hear hurtful shit from her grandma, go to school, get bullied all day by both the students and occasionally even the teachers, then got picked up by a manimal who'd take her to places and molest her, get back home and only to hear more hurtful comments by her grandma.  


Her obesity was another issue, doctor even told her parent's that she might not even get periods because of her obesity, anyways it was a miracle that she did. Around sixth grade she turned her life around, she went from being introverted to super extroverted, she also started coming second in almost every exam since then. She motivated her self to workout and lost a shit ton of weight  (the rapid weight loss did leave tons of stretch marks on her skin. but anyways she finally was sorta happy.  


Around 8th grade (she was 14 then) she got into her first relationship (with a dude who was 18 at that time. Like wtf?!). Anyways that guy treated her like shit, they broke up. Then around 9th grade  (she was 15 then), her parents forced her to choose science instead of arts or commerce (she wanted to go into arts cause she is really passionate about  literature, music, theater etc. Anyways after that she sorta lost interest in studies, she didn't, but she wasn't as passionate and she really couldn't grasp the subject no matter how hard she tried.  At that point she started hanging out with friends more often, secretly started smoking (she still does, she's not chain but she does enjoy smoking a lot.) and just sorta started coming home late. Which in result go her more verbally abused at home and got slut-shamed by her parents and everyday at home was a drag and she just preferred staying out more.  


Anyways we met around when she was at the end of 9th grade and I was at the end of 10th grade. Those days were nice. We both loved them. It was amazing at the beginning, still is, I love her wholeheartedly, she loves me too. But the life had to be a hoe and fucked her over again, the final results of 9th grade bad news. She went from second in class to twelfth (we live in a country where you are ranked in classes based on your results. Might as well also mention that our's is a conservative country so neither of our parents know that we are dating and we meet used to meet each other by sneaking behind our parents back.) Tbh 12th isn't that bad of a result, I mean I used to be 18th in my class (I just don't study, too lazy to do that). But yeah that drop hurt her a lot.   


Another thing I noticed by that point was she barely used to eat. She'd have tea at tiffin at school, she'd skip lunch most of the time or throw her food away when her parent's weren't looking. Also one day she had a row with her mom and her mom slut-shamed her. Anyways she called me afterwards that day, she sounded completely numb, said she was breaking up with me and that she was going to become a prostitute afterwards, anyways after a lot of talking she got tired and went to sleep, the she woke up with no memory of that conversation, she said such things happened previously too.  


Anyways then thing were going normally, we did start to have couple fights occasionally but it'd get patched up by the end of the day. Anyways then motherfucker corona virus came and fucked us over again.  


She's extroverted (I'm introverted mostly) and the quarantine really hit her hard, specially not being able to meet me and a few of her close friends hurts her a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

And here's a part I didn't mention, she has allergies and lactose intolerance. Way before the quarantine suddenly she started to get sever cases of allergies where her throat would get swelled up on the inside and it'd be a lot hard for her to breathe. Her parents got her checked up at a hospital but they were too motherfucking busy to get the report in four fucking months. Finally the hospital sent the report to them since they are doctors and sorta renowned. Anyways it arrived in the middle of the quarantine and surprise bitches, SHE'S GOT A PEPTIC ULCER. Expected tbh. Yeah but the report was already four months old and if that's not fucked up enough turns out she has an eating disorder and she can't for the love of life eat.   


Like no matter how hard she tries she can't eat, once she threw up and it was red (I suspect it was blood but she say's it's not.) Also her parent's are saying there is a high chance that the ulcer could turn cancer any day now. For the past two days she's been getting fever at random times, I don't think it's corona because the fever only comes at night.  


Oww btw did I mention she has a huge liking towards foods she should avoid, so not only does she barely eat, but also she eats stuff which only make it worse.  


Anyways, I have repeatedly told her to go to a doctor but she says's her parents say that it's not possible in this corona situation because those departments are closed.  


She has also has other thingy that happens, I guess it's related to the ulcer, basically she'll suddenly feel exhausted and she says the exhaustion comes from the middle of her stomach idk what she means by that but what I do know is if this continues she'll die before the quarantine ends.  


I really don't know how to help her, regarding her eating disorder she has admitted that she subconsciously is afraid of getting fat, Like she doesn't think fat people look bad but she sorta can't accept the idea of becoming fat.  


She has described her eating disorder as, ""I have food on my plate, hunger in my stomach, but I can't bring myself to eat."" Once she felt really hungry and took two pieces of cake on a plate with the intent to eat. Then she took a few bites and the she remembers washing the plate only to realize that she threw away the food from the balcony. Also she mentions that she sees herself eating in her dreams and that's why she feels full when she wakes up.  


Oww btw have I mentioned that the quarantine has sorta strained our relationship and we have fights every week. Things are alright between us atm, Anyways I really don't know what to do to save her. Please help me help her. Thank you for reading.  


TLDR: My gf has an eating disorder and a lot of mental issues and she has an ulcer and it's serious and she's prolly dying and she can't get treatment because of the quarantine.",24Apr2020,1

Alzheimer's disease is a devastating, progressive disorder that causes degeneration of neurons in the brain responsible for memory. Alzheimer's disease represents the most common cause of dementia and includes continuous decline in thinking, behavioral and social skills that disrupts a person's ability to function independently. In this episode, Dr. Daniel Palmer - Neuroscience Post Doctoral Fellow from Western University - joins us to discuss how MouseBytes - a repository for neuroscience behavioural data  - and various touchscreen operant tasks used with rodent models can be used to enhance drug development and ultimately increase the odds of getting worthy therapeutics to market. This work has vast implications for not only alzheimer's disease, but also Parkinson's Disease and several other psychiatric disorders. 

Manuscript: MouseBytes, an open-access high-throughput pipeline and database for rodent touchscreen-based cognitive assessment. Published in eLife. Open Access Article: https://elifesciences.org/articles/49630

Abstract
Open Science has changed research by making data accessible and shareable, contributing to replicability to accelerate and disseminate knowledge. However, for rodent cognitive studies the availability of tools to share and disseminate data is scarce. Automated touchscreen-based tests enable systematic cognitive assessment with easily standardised outputs that can facilitate data dissemination. Here we present an integration of touchscreen cognitive testing with an open-access database public repository (mousebytes.ca), as well as a Web platform for knowledge dissemination (https://touchscreencognition.org). We complement these resources with the largest dataset of age-dependent high-level cognitive assessment of mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease, expanding knowledge of affected cognitive domains from male and female mice of three strains. We envision that these new platforms will enhance sharing of protocols, data availability and transparency, allowing meta-analysis and reuse of mouse cognitive data to increase the replicability/reproducibility of datasets.",24Apr2020,1

I often suffer this voice that shames me whenever I moved or act in a certain way. It had been tough on me. Whenever I act in a certain way in public, it immediately attacks my confidence. I get anxiety. I start to panic. This voice has no mercy. Its brutal and mean. Quiet judgmental.

I know there's a lot of people suffering who are worse off than myself and Gary, and doing weekly fun videos probably wouldn't work for everyone, but I think trying new things during these times is important for the state of our mental health. So I guess what I'm saying is, maybe reaching out and connecting with people right now isn't such a bad thing. Obviously take the right precautions and don't get involved with the wrong people, but also push yourself out of your bubble because there are people out there who are not only feeling the way you feel, but just by talking to them makes a difference in their lives.

155,"The first time was just after highschool I atarted hearing murmuring but it was in my head so it’s not a hallucination that’s why I don’t consider it anything serious but it still really bothered me.

After almost a year it came back worse last year after I came back from camping with my friends. It started out like feeling trapped at work like I needed to get out and run because I was so energetic and thinking so much.
Then at night I would go to bed overthinking super fast and as soon as I woke up the next day it would do it again. Then started having embarrassing thoughts and just a bunch of super intense crap I can’t explain would just run through my head so quickly and agonizingly. It was so intense I couldn’t even get out of bed.
Then I started hearing murmuring again and then eventually different voices in my head and eventually I could make out that they were saying violent things... in the first person sometimes so honestly maybe it was just my imagination but still.

And not too long ago I posted a video with myself in it on Facebook and tons of people liked it and it’s happening again and this time I can’t fall asleep even tho I’m tired, everytime I wake up my mind starts going crazy and also I have an urge to shoot myself in the foot when it happens.

156,"Not eating when there isn’t a social convention to do so ?

Hear me out this sounds super strange I realise and also is madly embarrassing . I am so lazy I won’t cook or feed  myself, unless I get cues to do so.
It was worst at university and almost solved when I started work ( you go down to lunch at. A time pick up some food and eat it ) after work I would be in a house with other people and again it’s dinner time make dinner and so forth . Weekends were harder especially with lunch but I was improving.

I’ve been living by myself for the past five days and managed two full meals , part of this is due to anxiety making my stomach go but a larger part is just I can’t be bothered.

During these times I stick to the same food (fruit and popcorn weirdly ?)
Also as much as I hate to admit it and I know it’s not real weight I do get a slight satisfaction when I realise I’ve obviously lost weight in 5 days without trying.

Any advice or tips , what worked well before was meal planning or having a food delivery box come (although expensive it did take a way a lot of stress) I often find the first signal of anxiety is walking around the supermarket getting frazzled about what to buy.

Just want some advice really",24Apr2020,1

So basically I got out of a break up and I thought this guy was cute and my friend ended up hooking us together. I’ll try to make this story short. All of my friends and I went on a vacation together and he came. We weren’t really vibing and he was just very quiet. I had the window open and i heard him talking shit on me so I went outside and confronted his dumb ass. He claimed I was a very weird person, everyone laughs at me and bullies me, that I sleep too much, that I don’t drink enough alcohol. I was just taken back I have never had someone get mad over someone not wanting to drink and someone to actually say everyone laughs at me which is not true I think he’s insane. I was over him after hearing that and was disgusted and didn’t find him even remotely attractive anymore. Since he’s mutual friends with some of my friends I would have to see him I didn’t talk to him at all. Everytime I would see him he would text me wanna come over and harass me. I never would respond so I just blocked his gross ass. Is this man insane???? You don’t treat someone like that and think that you can still reach out to them.",24Apr2020,1

I spoke to my crisis worker and it was okay, but he had to tell my mum about the bleach so I don’t have that any more. I wasn’t certain if I was gonna drink it or not but it was kinda comforting just to know I had the option. I’m considering just sneaking out my window in the night and just finding a bridge somewhere but I’m scared that I’d get caught/ fall and get hurt (my room is in the loft). Ahhh im so fucking tired. I’m stuck in this limbo of wanting to die so so so badly , but also being afraid of what that entails. My great aunt just died of Coronavirus so it feels like such a shitty thing to do to even think about killing myself.

161,"I used to have somewhat a decent social life but once I graduated out of school, my friends became d-bags, and I don't talk to them anymore. I don't want to work at other places because people work there. I don't like people they don't get me. I feel like they are going to insult me in each way. Also, people just don't get me. I feel weird about myself, I don't need people. People are mean. All of them, I can tell something is up with them. They are making their ways to say bad things about me. I often depersonalize, my memories seem very distant and colorless. Almost like if they didn't exist. They seem like dreams.

 I was often fairly emotionally abused by my mother and sometimes other family members. She also was suffering from depression and had very bad stomach pains. She was diagnosed with gastritis. My dad was always working. I have a sister. We were pretty poor as well, we lived in a trailer home for a quite awhile until we moved when I was 12 to a better home. I was suffering from suicidal thoughts at a pretty young age. I hated life ever since I was 8. I was often called a brat, lazy, dumb, and crazy. My mom made me feel bad for the most part. She was the one that called me that and ever since I just gave up on school work. I try hard one time when I was in the first grade. I usually failed my math test but until one day I finally got a good score and I wanted to show my mom but she didn't care. She still called me lazy. My mom is now improving and isn't the person she was a long time ago. She is now realizing what she has done. It's still hard because I can't never forget about it. 

I want to be alone now. People don't get me anymore. They also don't make sense to me. So, why should I make sense to them? Fuck em. All of them are liars. They love to lie, cheat, and manipulate. They thrive in negativity. They thrive in your unsuccessful attempts. They always want to make themselves feel like they are the better ones. In reality, they are just as worse as you are. I logged off social media. I'm cutting off. I don't want to use it anymore. No more Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter. People just don't get me. I'm scared of them too. I can't work without getting this idea that they want to make fun of me. They hate me, i'm sure. I'm a stranger in a big planet filled with angst, insanity, and intensity. I don't belong in this planet. I belong somewhere else. 

I hate this reality, it's boring to me sometimes. Or maybe I'm the boring one? I don't know. Whatever it is, I don't like reality. Screw this reality, I wanna escape somewhere else. I just don't want to be here. 

My coping skills are drawing, writing these weird dysfunctional stories about rabbits committing illegal activity including treason, racketeering, and assassinating Ronald Reagan, doing ridiculous art about tweakers losing their shit, I like to draw Aztec gods type things, I like editing videos as well, I like going outside and seeing nature, I love Earth's beauty but not so much for human beings, playing video games, I love Super Mario Maker 2 because I make these hard as balls levels, I play through them and see if I can beat them, and I like to make stupid ass weird art on MS paint. I don't give a fuck about no damn expensive ass software so I can doodle my surrealistic gribbles. I like MS paint, it just adds shitty layers of irony. 

I'm scared of my brain. The biggest fear of mine is my own mind. My mind is very complex and dysfunctional. It's strange, I dissociate and I suffer through intrusive thought too. Intrusive thought is what it scares me. I hate those thoughts. I also can't STAND silence. Something about silence really fucks with me. I need music or I will freak out. I DREAD the dreadful silence. It's unknown. It's scary. It's mysterious. I hear these faints, these creepy ass faints. I hear people talking outside sometimes even though it's like 12 in the morning. I'm shocked and ready to grab the nearest weapon. I need some kind of sound or I just can't take it.  The night of me is just another day to daydream and pretend. I tend to daydream that I'm in a certain situation or just think of certain ideas. I was talking to myself about the war on drugs and how ineffective it has been for the people. I also daydream about an old man, a grandchild, and a heroin addict rabbit exploring a pit of nothing where monsters spawn in, dip, and go to a certain reality. I get real creative when I'm daydreaming at night. 

Well, I just don't know sometimes. I'm confused about life. What life is supposed to mean? How do I behave normally? How can I sink into other people's lives? How can I work like a normal person? I need to work and get used to people! I just want to stop pretending to feel like people are mean. Some day i'll understand? Maybe. I don't know but for the meantime, just find ways to be comfortable about life.",24Apr2020,1
162,"TW: mention of cutting (censored)

hi, so i’m a teen and i’m scared to ask my mom to go to therapy. i was going to ask her before the lockdown happened but i just couldn’t bring myself to do it. so here’s a quick backstory of why i want to go to a therapist (sorry if it’s long):

i’m in the lgbtq+ community (closeted) and even though my parents don’t really have an issue with that, my brother always tells me homophobic stuff about gay people and how they’re mental and that what they’re doing is wrong. i just feel awful everyday knowing that he has no issue telling me that stuff. he really doesn’t know how much he’s hurting me. he just wants to show is love to me every single day wether it’s hugging me or something like,t hat, but i know how different he’d treat me if he knew i was bisexual. i’ve literally cried so much this week and i can’t even rant to anyone. i tried writing journal entries but it made me feel like i was overreacting to things and made me think of myself as weak. i unfortunately had a habit of c**ting last due to homophobia and bullying i’ve dealt with from my “friends” year and i’m still trying to get over it, but it just feels so tempting sometimes. (and yes, my parents still don’t know that i used to c**) but the thing i’m wondering is if i ever have a therapy session, what will the therapists reaction will be to my sexuality? i live in a middle eastern country and everyone is almost muslim here. anyone in the lgbtq+ community won’t be greeted with a warm hug

aside from my homophobic brother, i’m moving to a whole different country this year. i currently live in a middle eastern country (turkey) and i’m moving to canada. it was already hard enough for me to make friends in turkey, and now i need to leave every single person i love and care about and start a new life. i know that my parents want me to have a better future, which i appreciate them sacrificing the life they committed so they can give us a better life, but whenever i talk about how sad i am for the changes that are going to happen, they just say “get over it” or” we’re sad too”. they never even had a conversation with me about this. they never gave me a chance to talk about how i feel, they just cut me off. and the fact that this whole corona virus thing is happening just makes me extra moody everyday. i really wanted to spend time with the people i love and people who listen to me, because that kind of love doesn’t come from my family. 

i’m really scared of failing, i always have to do things correctly and me and my parents did talk about that before but a lot of missing assignments have been piling up lately, and my mom is starting to get mad. all i literally do every single say is the homework my teachers give me. i’ve been feeling down lately (because of my brother) so i had no motivation to get out of bed or do anything. my parents call me lazy for that, but the thing is , they never even asked me how i was feeling. if they did maybe we could have a conversation about all the things i’ve been feeling. because of all the missing assignments i have, my mom started comparing me to s9me of my friends which made me really sad. she always told me not to compare people to each other, but there she is, comparing her own daughter to her friends

maybe i’m just overreacting but this is why i want to go to therapy, i just want someone to listen to me and give me advice. i don’t know why i’m scared to ask my parents, i don’t want them to start questioning i guess. i don’t want them to start questioning because i know that they’re going to brush it off. i really don’t know what to do and i’d appreciate anyone giving me advice &lt;3 stay safe everyone and have a good day or night !!

163,"Why do I feel like this whole corona virus is a subconscious dream that I’m having &amp; none of this is real life?
I’ve now been alone for 41 days. I know there are people in very extreme circumstances compared to mine, but I’m starting to crack. I can’t handle this anymore. The lack of human touch. Human interaction. This is truly the worst time to be living alone. My brain has almost started to reject accepting that this is our current reality. Dealing with a sudden death of a family member at the same as this plus realizing that my boyfriend ghosted me &amp; not knowing why...... makes me feel like none of this is real? This is a surreal time. It’s all too much to handle alone. My mind is constantly running 200 miles an hour trying to accept &amp; understand what’s happening. Staring at these 4 walls is slowing driving me into a mental state I didn’t know existed. 

Everyday I wake up and my heart physically hurts knowing that this is our lives for the next upcoming months. This is only the beginning. This is truly the biggest test of my mental strength, and now I’m no longer passing that test. I swear this depression &amp; crippling anxiety are going to kill me before the virus does. 

Not sure what the point of this post is, guess I’m just in need of reassurance that I’m not the only one feeling like this, I’m slowing getting out of control mentally. Scared of what’s in store. 
We’re all in this together but some people don’t see that as a vital concept right now.

However at this point my motivation to do anything to do with my degree has gone, I've been getting increasingly anxious about my academic performance *and* I just. I was doing fine with academic before, but at the minute I just don't feel the urgency that I used to. Well... that's wrong, I feel the urgency (giving me anxiety) but not the motivation to actually *do it*.   
I'm the type of person that can't just sit around though, and I thrive the feeling of having made progress each day, and learning is a part of this for me. It's been a big part of my recovery, so to not have as easy access to it has been to my detriment. I've started feeling bad for taking time off to look after myself, but when I'm working I feel like I'm doing nothing *but* and just want to get away from it for a minute, so it's a vicious cycle.

While I've spoken publicly about my sister's suicide it still isn't easy. I've been publicly shamed bc of how she died, called an ""outlier"", and even had someone say that my parents must have done something to her in their house suggesting all sorts of wild accusations. It's a reminder that we have a long way to go in educating those who struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts along with our entire society who has a lot more to learn about suicide.

169,"I know everyone's a little elated when they have a crush on someone, but I think I take it too far.

I'm 22 years old. What I do might be normal for a sixth grader to do, but I don't think it's normal for someone my age.

My entire life, I have been a horrible contrarian. I have always objected to things people have said in an effort to get attention. The more I'd get under someone's skin, the better I'd feel.

I decided I wanted to change when I developed a crush on a girl who didn't like that. Those contrarian urges left my brain within a week. When I talk to people now, I know exactly when I otherwise would have voiced an objection and I just stop it from happening. I don't look for arguments. It feels incredible!

This is an example that ended well, though I still think it's a problem it took the preferences of *a crush* to change me.

My parents tried and failed. My friends' parents tried and failed. Extended family tried and failed. Teachers in elementary/middle/high school tried and failed. Counselors tried and failed. College professors tried and failed. When a crush - whom I probably won't even see again until Fall - had a preference, I instantly changed.

This can also be unhealthy. A past crush had a really bad caffeine addiction and I couldn't help but follow in her footsteps.

There might be a name for this kind of condition.

170,"My life is a mess. I loathe my job, for 9 hours a day I am beyond miserable. I hate it. I hate the work I do, the company is awful, the GM all but said they care more about making money than the health of their employees. By the time I get home from work I am miserable, depressed, angry, achey, inpatient, and have no energy to deal with life at home.

Life at home is...I can't deal with it. I love my husband, when things are good, they are amazing. But, more often than not lately, it just sucks. He's out of work, so he's grumpy all the time. He'll do the dishes and cook most nights at least, but I still have to tell him what to cook every night and come up with recipes for him. I can't express how I feel unless how I feel is happy, because then he's unhappy, or thinks I'm accusing him of something. He's not supportive at all, of anything. 

Yesterday at work I found out a coworker had come to a full day of work, WITH symptoms, and then got tested, which was positive. So there is a good chance several people have been exposed. My husband is in a high risk group, so if I catch it and he gets it, we will either be bankrupt from medical bills because he doesn't have insurance, or worse he could die. I talked to my husband about whether or not I should quit and he told me I ""should just look for a different job"" because, honestly, we can even afford for him to not be working, much less both of us.

Today I found out his old boss offered to let him come back to work (he was let go because of lack of work because, again, of the pandemic), and my husband is most likely going to say no, because he didn't like that job.

I just give up, I can't mentally handle it anymore. I have checked out. I don't care anymore what my husband does. I'll just keep working because I have literally no choice but to be miserable.

I had an appointment scheduled with a therapist before the proverbial shit hit the fan....but it was cancelled due to the pandemic. I need help. My husband and I need counseling, desperately. I can't keep pretending I am always fine and happy with his crappy decisions.

But due to the nature of the world now, I can't get any help for my crumbling mental state. I can't get help for my marriage. What's even the point of trying when every day is a miserable soul crushing grind, where no matter what I do I am at fault...

My husband is not a bad guy, he is pretty great, but he needs therapy more than I do, he recognizes this and last time we talked was willing to go, but we can't afford it unless he gets insurance.

IDK if you all follow it, but he and I are extreme opposites on the Enneagram (recommended by our therapist).   
He = 4  
Me = 7  


We've found somethings through enneagram that really helped us understand how we show up in our relationship, but we struggle a lot with communication. I am not a huge ""feeler"", I don't have much on my mind most days, lol I know that sounds odd. But my boyfriend is emotional. He gets stuck in his own mind a lot and he's diagnosed manic depressive, he's chosen no medication, but still does therapy.   


It's a struggle when I'm a traditionally a happy person, rarely lean into my own sadness and typically the annoying type that has a very sunny outlook on life. It's hard for me when he tells me he feels things like, ""you \[me, his gf\] makes his feel like hes not valuable"" or ""i feel like you'd be happier with someone else."" I've never tried breaking up with my boyfriend, I've never told him there's anything ""wrong"" with him or us, I just dwell on things as much as he seems to and it's starting to feel like I'm a really bad thing in his life, like I make him feel these terrible things about himself and us. I feel like we have a great, loving relationship that sometimes has cracks, but what relationship doesn't? I'm realistic about love and people, I give trust immediately and freely, while my boyfriend needs people to earn it.    


We also push each other with our differences. He has helped me grow up and I remind him to live a little lighter.   


But in the end when depression hits him, I'm so shitty at navigating it. I physically love on him and my touches are intentional and full of care, but he wants deeper conversation, conversations about how we're not compatible and wants validation that we are, but when I say ""I value you"" or such, he immediately says ""well you dont make me feel that way"" and I am so lost at that sentence. I don't know what I'm doing wrong? I don't know what I'm doing that makes him feel invaluable. I feel like a negative contribution to his life and like if we broke up he'd be happier?

I returned a long time ago and my relationship with my parents has improved a bit, I'll never consider them friends, but at least we can live together with relative peace, I told my brother to never speak to me again in his life and at least he's respecting that.

I tend to compulsively remember facts from the past where I felt attacked and couldn't react in time *(because every time I started raising my voice against my mother my father would scream at me to shut me up without minding whether I had reason or not, he'd never defend me like he did for my younger brother, anyway I was forced to suppress my anger and it became a harmful habit)*, and kind of revive the incident and finally vent out my anger/sadness, so the point is today I went to a place I like and started walking in straight line, turn 180º and repeat, because this helps me with the reminiscing and venting, and when I was going back there were 2 men on a roof, 1 was imitating me in a mocking way and the other said something like ""this hot weather drives you crazy"", while laughing... I've recently learnt that getting mad at people like that is no use and only hurts you more, so I just nodded affirmatively and tried to go my way, yet they kept mocking me and laughing.

Please, I need someone to tell me I'm not crazy, that what I did makes sense, this is a sensitive topic for me because my family has called me that multiple times, and they mean it, they even took me to a psychiatrist and told him I was schizophrenic.

It’s very difficult for me to concentrate and I move around a lot popping my bones and I do this thing where I force myself to get cramps because I move my legs around a lot when I’m sitting, I also clench my jaw really hard all the time until it hurts. 

I don’t know if that’s important but I’ve done it all my life and I was thinking is this restless leg syndrome? I searched it up and I feel like this but I always want to move my legs and pop them not just in the evening also my arms. 

I also wondered if this is adhd? I looked up some symptoms jaw clenching and fidgeting are some as well as being talkative which I am not. But it says that certain noises bother them and I get annoyed extremely quick by small noises.

Or can it just be because of stress? Again I’m not asking to be diagnosed by someone on the internet just wanting to know someone else’s opinion if I  should speak to my doctor about this. If you think it’s just stress, how can I de-stress?",24Apr2020,1
183,"I have a friend that has AHDH and is bipolar. They haven't done much with their life in 13 years and has relied on their family and friends for everything including finances. Their last major accomplishment was graduating high school 13 years ago. No job, additional education, or significant other since. They have recently stopped taking medication for AHDH and bipolar because they says it makes them feel bad. It has reached the point that their family and friends are cutting them out of their life. Their brothers want nothing to do with them, multiple friends have abandoned them, their dad has cut him off emotionally and is only providing money. Their mom is about to abandon them. They lives with their brother right now, but their brother is waiting for COVID-19 to end to kick them out and dad is waiting for the word from the mom to stop giving them money. I recently reached out to their mom and she said she is at the end of her rope and so is the dad. The parents are telling me if they don't clean up their act in a couple months they will 100% be cut off. My friend doesn't know they are about to get cut off and that I have talked to their parents. The parents are asking that I don't reveal I have talked to them since my friend views people talking behind their back even if it to help them as a personal attack. I recently find out by talking to their mom that they are lying to everybody to make themselves seem like the victim. They leave out details or change just enough details to make you think they are the good guy. They claim they are fine and refuse help. They are claiming they can't be kicked out due to legal reasons. The parents have tried to cut financial help before and my friend threatens suicide. If you try to confront them about anything they become defensive. From their view point nothing is their fault and everything is everybody else's fault. I am running out of ideas at this point. Supporting them will just cause them to continue their current behavior. If they get kicked out, I am not taking them in as I know they will continue doing this and recently my friend was incredibly aggressive towards my wife for something as stupid as a detail in a video game she was asking for help on.  It is a long story with a lot of details that has been going on for far too long. What is about is just from this month.

186,"I just watched the end of titanic. I have never seen the movie before. As an adult who is 28 and married, I found the combination of Rose/Jack’s relationship and his death to be really frightening. The worst part was the scene where the dead bodies are just floating in the ocean and Lowe says “don’t hit them.” I think it touched on some of my worst fears. When I think of what hell might be like, I don’t think of fire and pitchforks. I think of a black void with seemingly no boundaries. I think of endlessness with no definition. The boat out in the dark where there is no visible end was just dreadful. I think it was the worst thing I have ever seen in a movie by far. I wasn’t expecting something from 1997 to be so emotionally intense.

More than anything, it made me think about the feeling of dread I get with this virus. I think about losing my wife, which is so horrifying I can’t bear to dwell on it. This morning, I woke up after crying to sleep thinking about things way too heavy for a human to bear like these. It sounds dramatic, but I just became so connected with my heart and core fears that I sort of cracked for a minute. 

I told my wife how much I loved her and we cried together on the couch. It felt really good to re-connect despite feeling so distant just 3 feet apart working from home on computer screens. We haven’t been especially nice to each other since this all started. We are both very overworked and very deficient in vitamin D because work is so demanding and school is also full of checklists and deadlines. With both of us working and going to school online, it feels like a cage has been built around our office space. I can’t get out no matter how hard I try to just sit in the living room, play Fortnite and not think about my responsibilities. There are no boundaries between work and play. Even if I find time to get away it doesn’t matter because the looming feeling of Monday is just 10 feet away in another room.

This is what drove me to feeling pretty disassociated with reality. I’m glad we at least got to connect today and I feel better now that I am out of my thoughts and back in reality. I’m going to be okay, and you are too. My suggestion would be to just try not to overthink things and put your damn phone away like I will try to do after writing this.

187,"TW: sh, suicide mention, sexual assault, abuse, drugs

I'm sorry if this isn't allowed, it's my first post here but I'm really at my wits end and I don't know where else to turn. I'm really desperate.  

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of context: My mother has always had a problem with mental health; she was always very open about being depressed when I was a kid, she's been taking prozac for 18 years, and from what I can piece together from what she and others have told me, she's had some really serious stints of self harm and suicidal behaviour. 

&amp;#x200B;

About 6 years ago, my parents separated whilst I was away at uni. It turned out my dad was having an affair with a much younger woman and they decided to call it quits. My brother and I were obviously pissed at him, we didn't talk for about a year, but my mother took it really, really hard. Her mental health took a huge plummet, she was always crying, talking about how much she wanted to die, etc. We knew it was going to be tough for her, and that that kind of thing takes a lot of time and you might never fully heal from it, so we tried to take care of her best we could; even my uni housemates used to send her pictures of cute animals every day and check in with her too. We started to get worried about a year or so later when she wasn't getting any better, if anything, she was probably getting worse. My brother and I had started to patch up our relationship with our dad at that point, and our mother said she was fine with it (we made sure to check first). During this time I was still away at uni, but my brother took a year out, so she had someone with her every day. Once he moved out too she still seemed okay, we got her a dog (a cute shiba inu, her favourite) and called her most days. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few years ago it got so much worse. Her depression morphed into something else - in particular, she's extremely paranoid. For example, my brother didn't tell her about a guy he was casually hooking up with, and she got extremely upset. She was crying and screaming and throwing things around, called him horrible and evil for not wanting to share that. My brother is autistic and he really struggles with expressing and understanding emotions so that was really hard on him, plus he and that guy were literally just hooking up, it's not like they were together or anything. She also read his messages on his phone without asking, where he'd told a friend about that altercation (because he was confused and wanted someone to help explain it to him) and she was horrified that he'd be so nasty and unfair and insensitive, she cried about it for months.Just the other day, I posted a cute selfie on facebook using a dumb freckles filter from snapchat, and she messaged me asking why I'd do that to her. I asked what she meant, and she explained that the woman my dad had left her for had freckles, and I was being cold and insensitive for not thinking of her. I said I couldn't have known that and she said I must check her photos often (which I don't) so therefore I must have known and was trying to be hurtful. I apologised, and the next day I forgot to cc her into a family email and she flipped out about how I obviously don't love her and how my evil father has brainwashed me or something.  

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My dad is a bit of a morally dubious man, but he's not evil. I didn't know this at the time because he never told me, but I found out from someone else that she had also cheated on him, and gotten pregnant, but the baby didn't survive. I asked him about this and he confirmed it. I found out from some other people that she has a history of having extreme paranoia, and once accused my uncle of r\\\*ping her without any reason (they were never left alone at the event in question so it was easily proven false). He still loves my mother a lot, just not in a wife kinda way. Since they split up, he bought her a house and a car and pays for all of her bills etc. He also does all the repairs on her house and any physical labour she needs. He doesn't have a lot of money and really struggles to pay her expenses, but whenever I've spoken about this to her she says she feels entitled to it because of all the pain he caused her. Again I don't think he's a perfect guy either, and I don't agree with what he did, but I think it's a bit weird to be so reliant on your exhusband. I've never been in that situation so maybe I'm wrong tho. I asked when she'd consider his debt paid and let him live his life, and she said 'when he's finally dead'. She threatens to hurt him all the time, which is something I'm worried about too. She plays it off like a joke (i.e. she picks up a knife and says 'haha I could stab him right now! but I won't' with him stood right there) but her emotions snap so fast I'm worried she'll be joking about it and then take it too far. She used to be a very warm, gentle person so I don't want to think she would do something like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Adding on to that she's very into new age spirituality, which I think helped her a lot in the beginning! But now I think it makes it worse. She once publicly accused me, in front of my entire family, of being so evil and negative I opened up a portal to hell in her house, which invited loads of evil energies into her space which cursed her and the dog. So everything bad that was in her life was my fault at the time (because I cursed them via hell portal). She was also convinced she was full of ectoplasm or something but I didn't really understand that part.

&amp;#x200B;

She had a very difficult upbringing with a lot of drug abuse, which I think might have caused some visual or auditory hallucinations. I don't have any proof of this, but she often claims to see things like gnomes or hear voices, which she thinks are spirits. I don't want to denounce those things either, but when I was a child I struggled with insomnia and hallucinated a lot due to it. She used to insist that the things I saw were probably real and I just had a stronger connection to magical things like her. (I've since seen a mental health professional who helped me understand my hallucinations) 

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to talk to her about this and encourage her to get some help, but she used to be a therapist before my parents split so she thinks she knows it all already, and when I have managed to get the conversation past that stage she either threatens to kill herself or shouts about my brother and I being brainwashed by my dad. She's the same way when my brother tries to talk to her, and she doesn't have many friends because her paranoia caused her to lash out at them and they all cut her off. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. I love my mother but I'm scared she's gonna hurt herself. I've done everything I can think of. I talk to her every day, sometimes for hours, we've gone on trips at my expense, etc, but as soon as I do something 'wrong' it's back to square one again and she thinks I'm evil. I've tried to organise therapy visits etc or make her doctors appointments to update her medication but she just won't go. I also helped her set up a business so she could make money separate from what she gets from my dad but she just didn't do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm exhausted, she needs to get some help and it's getting worse every day that she's in isolation too. 

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do? I'm in the UK, does anyone have any ideas on what help I can get her during this pandemic? I'm really really desperate. I want her to be safe.

189,"I’ve been friends with this girl for a few years now and I’ve know that her mental health wasn’t great, but recently, I’m starting to think she might need more serious help.

She recently got out of an emotionally abusive relationship and then corona happened, so all that might be making it worse. She needs constant validation and is terrified of being alone. Within these past few months, little things have been setting her off. A small rejection will cause a several day long spiral where she hates herself and won’t listen to anyone. Me and several other friends have tried to talk to her for weeks but it goes nowhere.

It’s way too much to explain, but it seems to all boil down to insecurity issues? I don’t know much about this kind of stuff so I apologize if assuming things is rude.

194,"I was raised in a cage of medical neglect made out of lies my parents told me about what’s normal, accusations of being a hypochondriac, and the looming threat that if I dare tell my doctors about these normal things that they won’t believe me when there is a real problem. I kept everything a secret for as long as I could, because I was certain I was exaggerating and I didn’t want to die just because my doctor couldn’t trust me when I needed it. It is worth noting, however, that I was not wrong: the chronically infected tonsils had to be removed when I was 19, the excessive uterine bleeding led to a hysterectomy at 22, and I was diagnosed with and started treatment for narcolepsy at 21. 

My Facebook memories have been showing me all of the things I thought were normal enough to say when I was keeping things secret though, and it’s been a lot. I started collecting all of the posts that clearly said sleep disorder, such as: “why is waking up by myself at 7am an achievement,” “when you wake up from a surprise nap: “you’re home?? I thought you left without telling me!” Thanks dad,” and “I like to wear face masks while I do my homework. I fell asleep pretty early on. There’s Dead Sea mud on my bed.” My mom even posted and tagged me in a photo where I was 15 and fell asleep on the kitchen floor. Those are just a few of the dozens, so I’d started saving them to put up all at once somewhere with something like “I can’t believe you guys just let me say this shit. I didn’t know these things weren’t normal, but you did.” I hadn’t decided for sure, just that I was upset that those were things I thought were normal enough to share when I thought people finding out about my symptoms would be the end of the world. I was especially afraid of people finding out about my narcolepsy because my mom said I’m totally fine, but even if I wasn’t it doesn’t matter because there’s nothing that anyone could do to help and they’d just take my license away. A professor asked me if I had it when I was 18, so I had a good idea on that one, but that’s why my mom said the above. It’s been bothering me a lot in the 10 months since my diagnosis. Nobody helped me when they could see I wasn’t okay.

But it gets worse. I decided to quickly search through all of the things I ever put on Facebook to be sure I didn’t miss any tired posts, and I honestly wish I didn’t. The only thing that made me okay about my lifetime of depression before diagnosis at 15 was the fact that nobody could tell and I was just an amazing actress... except that it turns out that’s just another lie from my parents. I had started self harming at 12, but I wasn’t attempting suicide until I was 15. Unfortunately, I found some excessively depressed Facebook posts that absolutely warranted a phone call at least. Things like: “I hate talking education with my dad. Nothing I do will ever be good enough! (feeling worthless),” “sometimes good enough just isn’t good enough:(;(,” and worst of all, “that awkward moment when... I woke up and I was still alive.” Yep, I literally posted these and many others. The last one is what gets me though because it is literally as red as flags get and nobody did anything at all. I was 13 when I posted that last one, there was still so much time before I got help. My older brother once broke up with his girlfriend dramatically and the police were called to assess his suicide risk, but I posted literally that and nothing happened. 

It’s not just that my parents sucked, which is honestly taking some intense therapy to struggle to understand, but also that __*nobody else cared either.*__ My mom is refusing to say she loves me because she’s mad at me for leaving, and that’s brutal, but I can’t stand the idea that I all but posted ‘I would do anything to die, somebody help me.’ People missing narcolepsy symptoms is much easier to understand (despite the clear severity) than people missing a literal cry for help. I wasn’t an actress. I wasn’t good at hiding things. All of the humans must have known, there’s no way they didn’t. I can’t believe everyone I’ve ever known let me down like this.

I’ve never felt so worthless. I don’t know how to be okay.",24Apr2020,1
195,"So ever since i was a kid i realize i have had obsessive behaviors and thoughts that will completely take me over for months and then suddenly disappear. Only to be replaced by another obsession that will last another few months, and the cycle repeats. These obsessions can include, hobbies, people, or thoughts. For example I can go really hard on trying to read as many books as i can for months think of nothing else id rather spend my time on and then suddenly lose interest, and move onto another hobby. With people if i like someone i will think about them constantly and can get to the point where i almost forget about anyone else i just want to talk to them and get really frustrated about them then a few months later, i'll wonder why i obsessed over them.

Now, its not like everything is fleeting for me. There are some definite constants of things i like or don't like and that don't really change. But i just notice this tendency towards obsessive behavior and it gets on my nerves at times and i want to stop but i can't. There are some good points to it like i can learn a lot about something in a short amount of time.

Ive struggled with two mental health disorders in the past (bulimia and depression) and i thought i understood what different types of mh illnesses there were but recently ive come across something thats so so stressful and im not even sure how to understand what it is.

basically, my mood and feelings and emotions change every five seconds and i dont know what to do about it.

I can literally go from being so happy to being so sad to being so angry in the space of 2 minutes and every single time i get so frustrated.

My girlfriend and I had been having relationship issues for some time before this, no explosive arguments or anything like that but we just weren’t making each other happy. The other night she brought it up again and I finally said it would be better if I moved back in with my sister. She seemed fine with it, if not a bit detached. The next day started out fine as well, we went for a walk and then she said she saw me across the street (where I was not) and said something about a time loop, I wrote it off as a coincidence and went back to working remotely upstairs. Then her episode started, at first she said she could hear me talking about her (I wasn’t) and then it got really bad. She was panicking, hiding from figures and voices, and it was really scary and I know I didn’t react the right way. I tried to get her to sleep after she calmed down a bit, but after I fell asleep she got out and crashed her car and went to her parents house, where she’s been since. But then she started facetiming me, asking me what my endgame was, why I planted cameras around the house, accusing me of things and mocking me when I became upset. She came over when I was packing my things and was like an entirely different person, she was cold and mocked me for crying, accused me of stealing from her, etc. It was really upsetting. She’s still texting me saying I pushed her into this, I’m the crazy one, that my plans against her aren’t gonna work. 

Before this all happened she used to say even if we broke up we could still be friends, that she might visit me when I moved, etc. I really miss the way she was.

206,"Sorry this is very long. My Dad was once a really giving, caring person until January 2019 when he suffered from I guess what would be described as a mental breakdown. He quickly deteriorated and ended up in a facility for 6 months. 

I spent a month trying to care for him in his home prior to this. My Dad wouldn't eat unless I brought him food and set it in front of him, he quit his job knowing he didn't have a safety net and used through my savings quickly as a result.
At that time I had just accepted a huge promotion, which ultimately I had to step down from as I couldn't manage my Dads care as well as all the travel expected of me to train for my new role.

When he was discharged from the facility I had to take over all his responsibilities from selling his house, finding him a new place to live, furnishing his new home, securing his income, arranging all medical appointments and sorting out really everything an adult person would have e.g. His car, taxes, insurances, banking, redirecting mail, cancelling subscriptions, driving him anywhere he needed to go.

My Dad is now like a giant child. He refuses to do anything except exist and takes every opportunity to make others feel it's their fault.
I have a hard enough time managing 2 sets of adult responsibilities but no matter what it's always a fight ""Why do I have to do this!?"" ""I don't want to go!"" like dealing with a child having a tantrum everytime i have to take off work to take him to another appointment. 

-He puts off essential things even though I've had to take the time off work to do it, he says ""not today"" but he doesn't seem to realise that it needs to be done and that means me using yet another day of leave to do it on another day when he may or may not feel like doing it. 
-I tried to furnish his home so he has somewhere comfortable to live, I started getting constant phonecalls during work to tell me what I'm doing is making his mental state worse so I stopped, now he reminds me he's miserable and lives in a 'shit hole'.
-We live in a cold country, he refuses to put his heating on, I try going in and setting the timer but he just changes it when I leave. I tried to purchase heating oil for him as I'm getting my own and it's cheaper together and easier for me to arrange but he's warned me not to do that - yet it will still fall to me in a few months time when he really needs it.
-Basically he does nothing for himself and gets in the way of anyone trying to do things for him, then blames everyone else when he doesn't have what he needs or wants.

My Dad doesn't speak to me anymore unless it serves him. I feel like I exist to calm his anxieties and nothing more. If he takes a notion into his mind that something has happened to me or will happen to me I have to be available to reassure him. He is only interested in offloading his paranoid thoughts onto me for reassurance. Sure sometimes they involve me but it still doesn't really feel he cares for me if that makes sense. He just needs me to make him feel better. He has never asked about my promotion so I'm unsure if he even knows I couldnt take it, never asked about my house, my pregnancy or anything else going on in my life. Even with lockdown he calls only to make me feel guilty that he doesn't have any visitors when he was closing the door in people's faces a couple of weeks prior. 

Anyway. The situation as it is now, for a start I'm pregnant, so I can't continue doing everything for him to the point where all he has to do is feed and bathe himself and still complain he has too much stress.
Mentally I'm just done too. I'm stretched thin but it's more the constant fighting, the guilt imposed on me for his situation, the fact I can't seem to get anything right for him and the hurt that he has 0 interest in me or his first grandchild. He has declined all help and treatment so it looks like his plan is for us to do this forever and I'm to sacrifice my family life, career and my own mental health to cater to him. I'm still unable to process how this person is my Dad, my resentment grows daily and I have been battling with what to do for a while now. It's as if he forgets I'm actually a whole person with a life of my own, to his mind it's like i only exist to be used.
I get frustrated as he doesn't realise how lucky he is, he turns his nose up at all the help he gets. When I was severely unwell with an eating disorder I would have been incredibly thankful if someone removed every responsibility from my life for me and took care of it all while I got better. He fails to realise most of the mentally ill don't have the luxury of simply dropping everything onto someone else.

If anyone takes the time to read this I would be grateful for any advice. Where do I draw the line? Has anyone else experienced this in their adulthood?",24Apr2020,1
207,"I have only one person who can give me support. Now I believe it’ll be his parents. 

He’s suppose to help a family member of mine with some legal stuff, as he’s a lawyer. Unfortunately he’ll be dealing with my abusive aunt. 

Him and I are trying to keep his job professional during this. I have/had feelings for this man as well. But I believe that’ll be changing when I find out the truth. But I know I can’t be involved  either way because I need to seek medical attention first. 

His family will more than likely be the one helping me me while he handles all the stuff he needs to. I do believe there is some level of misunderstanding as well as lack of trust. Preciously to him needed to help my family, he said something things he shouldn’t have said, I realized what he was saying was more than familiar to me and saw it as a problem and the feelings with it. And I know it wasn’t my mental health making things up. Since then, I’ve lost some things important to maintaining a good mental health. My life has been ripped away from me and put on hold in the last year and I cannot do anything. 

My only support I really don’t trust now. Not just because of what he did to me, but because outside of this situation someone else on his side is involved! I just feel he’s trying to tear me away from my family, and spread a little bit of hate for my career, and who I am. ETC. I believe it’s best for me to step away entirely and watch the situation unfold as this very hard for me. If I’m right, he’ll be losing his job due to his parents and his treatment towards me. 

I don’t know what’s going on mentally though. I can only guess PTSD/Depression and maybe anxiety. I know I have to be careful because I do jump back to not trying to self diagnose until I know. 

TLDR: I need to step back and take care of myself, and know I saved this mans life. I’m glad they’ll uncover something new by looking at me, I guess.",24Apr2020,1

209," I live in the UK but I'm writing a screenplay about a mentally ill person in the states, I'm trying to get a scenario happening where the protagonist must attend regular meetings with a psychiatrist/therapist to check he's okay, with an underlying threat of him being involuntarily committed by them if he is deemed to be dangerous to himself, are there any specific real life programmes like this where e.g you may have self harmed and are known to be a danger to yourself so they put you on a regular meeting with a therapist as opposed to immediately sectioning you?

212,"I’ve been feeling more anxious recently about pretty much everything. I’m terrible in social situations, even online. If I say or do something and I get thanked for it, I feel bad. It’s like I feel like I didn’t deserve it. And I fear that when I say something nice, and the other person doesn’t say anything, that I’ve ruined the moment or scared them away. And if I ask about it, that makes me feel bad too because it feels like I’m fishing for reassurance or praise even though that’s the last thing I want. That makes me feel like a narcissist or something. 

I also have a really hard time talking about my feelings. I’m actually anxious right now. My family is amazing, but I can never talk about this stuff with them. It makes me feel awful because they would be supportive and there are a lot of people in worse situations. I have 1 friend who’s been really great in getting me to open up more, but I feel like it’s also unleashed more anxiety and past grief I never dealt with. I’m just scared over words constantly.

I also have this overwhelming need to please people. I don’t know why but I feel like I should always be agreeable and adopt the interests of those around me. Even if I have something that I like, I hide it in shame even if it’s just something simple like a new song or tv show. And I also get attached very easily to others despite my social anxiety, though it’s usually just one person who I want to spend as much time with as possible.

I just don’t know what any of this means or why I’m so anxious about everything. I know I need therapy, but it’s not really an option at the moment. Partly because of money and partly because I’m terrified of looking for one and talking to them. If you made it this far, and you have any ideas of what could be the matter with me, I’d really appreciate some guidance. And I’m sorry if this was less than coherent",24Apr2020,1

214,"I have a friend I’ll call Ryan. I’ve known him since 5th grade and we are now in our first year of high school. I am very concerned about his condition. When we were a bit younger I used to brush off the strange things he told me, but now that I have a better grasp on these subjects, I don’t know what to do to help him, but I want to. I know he is clinically depressed, has an anxiety order, and is a post anorexic, but on top of that, he is a trans male and struggles with gender dysphoria. I know his parents don’t support his gender identity and from what he’s told me, they seem like awful parents. Whenever I see them interact with Ryan they use his deadname and female pronouns. Last night he told me about how he thinks he doesn’t deserve to live a better life and how he didn’t want people to care about him and it has me really worried. I am leaving some things out here, but are there any things I can do to help him with his mental state as his friend?",24Apr2020,1
215,"“The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.”- David Foster Wallace",24Apr2020,1

I was sexually abused by a neighbor who was just two years older then me from the age of 4-8. I pushed the trauma away and just about a year ago it all came back to me... I was in a car crash at age 9 that has changed my life. I’m scared of everything, I don’t do anything that could possibly result in me being injured. I was diagnosed with POTS at 12 and I suffered extreme suicidal thoughts that year to the point where I almost committed. I have always felt different than my family and have always felt like they all loved me but didn’t like me. With all my problems and all my mental health challenges I feel like all I ever do is drain everyone and annoy them. I am not a child to them.. I’m their problem. I have social anxiety and it affects me in so many ways with basically effects my family. I can’t help it. I try and I try to make friends and be happy and be a good person but I can’t, I don’t know how. My family will never be happy with me. I will never have a group of friends. I will never have a talent, skill of hobby. I will never be known for anything. I will never make the most of my life. I will never get a successful job. I will never find love.

I always try to make my friends feeling good about their confidence, some have problem with this. One of them asked me how to approach a girl and how to feel confident around them and in everyday's life. I also helped many times my girlfriend with some stress and confidence problem. I always try my best to answer but the truce is that I lack of confidence and I never know what to say. I never achieve my goal, can't get where I want to be. It hurts especially about my studies, I love what I study but it is hard and I feel so down sometimes, like I can't go anywhere bc my grades are whit although they aren't. This lack of confidence sometimes end with a difficulty to work.

224,"I don't know how to explain it. I've come a long way from my childhood, which was abusive, I've graduated and I have a good job, but I feel like there's nothing for me. Nothing to look forward to. No reason to be alive. I've been with my boyfriend for 8 years but it's obvious that he doesn't care about me or my feelings. 

I'm young enough but I feel like there's just no point to continuing. Sometimes I genuinely feel like life is just one long road full of traps and the thought of being on the lookout for all of them my entire life makes me feel ill with anxiety. I've never been suicidal with any sort of realism, and that's not really the case now. I just feel so disillusioned and done with life. It seems like too much effort. I don't feel like there are any good experiences in store for me. I honestly feel like a mistake, and I would be better off if I didn't exist.  

People talk about doing fun stuff like traveling or whatever, but I don't think that's ever going to happen for me. I don't think having kids is smart given the current environmental and economic situation. There's just no point to prolong this stupid blot of an existence.

I have a therapist but I haven't talked to her about this, we mostly focus on my relationship. The relationship is pretty bad. I feel so hopeless, that I've spent 8 years with this person and the way that it's panned out. He;s obviously not happy with me, but too complacent to do anything, and I'm not any better, given he calls me names and I'm still here. He used to be my safe space, I used to be able to tell him anything and he was the first person to show me that love could mean something after my childhood. We've been together since I was 15 but it's just gotten so muddied and twisted and awful. I really try my best, I don't know what to do or how to communicate to him how much it breaks me to have him look me in the face and tell me to shut up, or calling me a bitch. He's nearly my only family. I don't understand how it got this way. I don't know what I did wrong to have it go this bad.
