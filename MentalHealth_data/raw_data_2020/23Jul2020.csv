1,"I have a deep feeling that everyone internally hates me and is tolerating me. My friends only like me because I'm dating my boyfriwnd and I'm pretty sure they flinch when I come by because I'm so awkward and annoying. A part of me thinks the only reason my boyfriend is with me is because I'm pretty, and that most people talk behind my back, mentioning how much they hate me or don't like being around me.

Ohhh it's middle school that cemented the feeling. I suppose that's why I don't get upset when people treat me badly, I just think, well it's happening again, and I should take it because I serve to get tested like shit since I'm so annoying. Like it's finally showing, and I'm lucky that they tolerated me for so long. I have this air of I don't care, because I couldn't defend myself so I thought that pretending it doesn't matter was the next best thing. That's why maybe I don't react when people are being mean to me. This underlying feeling of ""I'm annoying and people think there's someone wrong with me, and they tolerate me. They probably grimace when I'm around.""

It's funny, hearing my boyfriend say that my friends love me. I don't believe it. I need to make them laugh, buy them things in order to get people to live me. And if I give them enough toys, they can stay. Only unless I continue to give them things.

I have a desperate need to be liked because I feel that my life has no value. Like if I just keep giving people things, they'll stop.

I just realized that I have this feeling cemented into my personality, like a fact that's true. I really don't know how to make it stop. But realizing there's a problem is the first step.",23Jul2020,9
2,"My mind is always throwing all these thoughts and feelings at me. There is so much chatter and so many voices. It makes me want to scream sometimes.

I just can’t focus anymore. I’m constantly spacing out. I’m always in a daydream. I can’t fight it, it inserts itself into my reality and I don’t know what’s real and what’s not. I can’t even tell you what goes on when it happens. When I come to, it’s like a dream and it instantly fades. I know that these dreams are not good mostly. They leave me shaken up and disturbed.

Sometimes it’s so strong and it takes me back to an earlier time in my life. I get these incredibly vivid flashbacks, these feelings of being back in that exact moment. It feels like I sync up back with that time and I remember so many details. These stick out in my mind over the other waves of feelings for some reason.

My reality is in a constant state of flux and I’m having trouble bearing it anymore. There are so many things wrong with me but this is causing me so much distress. I’m so tired of this life.",23Jul2020,1

Trigger Warming: Depression and suicidal ideation. Please don’t read this if you are dealing with any of those things :)

TL,DR: I haven’t felt peace since I was 12. I’m 17 now and even though I’m much better from where I was at some point, I’m not really happy and I’m going through a depressive episode. I’m asking reasons to be happy.

When I was a kid everything was fine, I only had to worry about having good grades and playing, but that changed when I entered junior high. I don’t really know why, but I wasn’t feeling happy in the way that I did when I was a kid. I don’t want to share details but let’s say that’s things weren’t that good.
The following year was one of the worst years of my life, and that is when my whole sadness started affecting other things (I’m not a psychologist therefore I can’t say this with 100% of certainty, but I think I was dealing with social anxiety by that time). So I started going to therapy when I was around 14. Now, I wasn’t completely honest with my therapist and that made things harder, at one point she suggested that I could be going though depression (I obviously was) but I straight up lied to avoid that conversation (even though she probably knew I was lying). So my lack of honesty and unwillingness to go through certain topics in therapy, made the sessions kind of useless. By the time junior high ended I couldn’t take it anymore, I felt so hopeless and drowned in my own problems that I blew up all my chances to go to any high school and I isolated myself from society, my friends, and my parents for around 3 months. By this time I spent all night (10 pm to 6 am aprox) awake just killing time, and I slept during the day. I only left my room to go to the bathroom or to get some food, I pushed all of my friends away (two of them didn’t let me push them away and they are friends with me till this day, I love them they are amazing), my parents were obviously worried but I avoided contact with them etc, etc. My life didn’t made any sense; I felt empty, I had no will to live but I didn’t wanted to die either.
What kept me going forward was an imaginary future where everything was perfect. When I was a kid, I fantasized about being a superhero and those fantasies made my day more fun; but as I grew older, those fantasies became my tool to cope with my reality. They were imaginary versions of the future where I was living an unrealistically perfect life (a shit ton of money and that kind of stuff), and those fantasies were the only thing stopping me from killing myself. The promise that all of those things could true if I worked hard enough made life worth it. By the end of August 2018, I realized that those fantasies were never going to come true (because they were disgustingly unrealistic) and in that moment I lost all hope in life. I talked to my mom that day and after a visit to my doctor and a psychiatrist, I was clinically diagnosed with depression and I was also prescribed antidepressants.
Shortly after that, I went back to therapy and I stopped taking antidepressants by January 2019. Some months later I started high school, but I dropped out because the anxiety was really bad, to the point where I couldn’t breathe. Since then I’ve been slowly getting better. I’ve made a constant effort to open up more in therapy and I’ve understood that a lot of the things that happened were the consequence of unresolved childhood trauma that I wasn’t aware of. I’ve had some really happy moments, and I’m optimistic most of the time.

The problem is that when the coronavirus pandemic started getting serious, my therapist said that the therapy sessions had to be on video call (obviously) and for reasons I prefer not to share here, I decided to stop going to therapy until we could make the sessions in person again. That’s not going to happen anytime soon, and I’ve been slowly getting back into my toxic state of isolation which doesn’t make me happy at all. Specifically this week, I’ve felt the saddest I’ve felt in a really long time. Not only because of my personal situation, but because the world is a fucking mess right now and the fact that I can’t do anything about it makes me feel horribly sad (I know that I can do some things, but nothing on a bigger scale). I want to be happy despite the world being a mess, I don’t want my emotions to depend on how good or bad the world is, but I can’t feel happy either.
I’m going back to therapy soon (on video call), and I’m sure I’m gonna get past this depressive episode in the future but I need reasons to feel happy now. (As I was writing this, I realized that writing how I feel helps me a lot)

That’s all, thanks for reading. Have a good day/night.",23Jul2020,1
4,"How do y'all motivate yourselves to clean while having a long bout of depression? My apartment is small and the mess is everywhere. The bathroom sink has my fiance's trimmed beard hairs all over it. The sink is over flowing. The table is piled high. I can't get myself to clean anything. I also have OCD and organization is the poison my brain picked for me. When I have a small time of clarity, I look around and am disgusted at my living space. It also makes me extremely anxious and then I'm disgusted with myself for letting it get this bad. Here comes the depression for another week or 2 and rinse and repeat.

I'm not a house maid or whatever, but I take pride in a clean home. I'm disabled and my wonderful fiance works 40+ hrs/week, comes home to go back out to the gym and then he studies for school for a few hours. I can't ask him to also clean the house, I feel bad for him taking on the financial load. (Recently had to stop working due to my disabilities.) I want to feel, in some way, productive in this relationship. I want to have a nice home for him to come home to relax in. I also want to be able to relax.

I'm currently looking around and the anxiety kicks back in. Help?",23Jul2020,3

10,"That's what it feels like. It's not my fault that I had to drop out as I had 0 options and was told so by everyone I spoke to. But companies don't care.

And if it's not bad enough that you don't have a degree, a lack of published work in your name will seal the deal. Forget the fact that you've written thousands of pieces of work for others; if it's not in your name, you might as well have shit on the keyboard.

I am so tired of living to work and working to live. There's no point and it's all stupid. Most days I just want to die because there's nothing worth living for. I can barely afford a place to live that isn't infested. Buying a house is going to set me back so far. And then what? I own a house and still work a miserable job that I hate because I can't go anywhere else.

I feel like I'm a worthless person and no one seems to care. It's just ""keep on going, just do one day at a time"". Well, when every day feels like this, sometimes all you can do is wonder why you're still going.

The best part is I've asked for help so many times. I've shelled out thousands to fix myself and came out of it with my mental health worse than before, side effects from meds that fucked me up, and an MMJ card. Cool. So when I feel like I want to die all I can do is get stoned off my ass and try not to eat everything in sight.

I really don't know what my issue is or if it's even a mental health condition, I've never seen a professional. This last few  years I just can't seem to have a good day. Today I went on a date for the first time in a while and it went super great, she was great, she said she wanted to do it again. Yet here I am sitting alone having convinced myself that it wasn't good and she wants nothing to do with me. I do the same thing with work, my family and friends. I have this special ability to make myself unhappy, I can sit alone for hours and come up with conversations and scenarios that have never happened and probably never will. I can convince myself that anyones good will or just general niceness towards me isnt real. It just leads to me being angry at people for absolutely no reason like they're always out get me when in reality they're not, I've pretty much talked my self out of being able to trust anybody. The crazy thing is I am fully aware that I do this and I try to stop my self yet cant seem to stop dreaming up these ridiculous scenarios. I've really lost all desire to have any intimacy with anyone whether it be on a physical or emotional level because I'm so sure it's going to lead to something bad. I have this urge to just run away from everything (move away not take my own life) but then I think what happens if one of my family members gets sick or dies suddenly and I can't be there for that, the anxiety of that keeps me right where I am.

But the problem here is that I live in an urban area, and the nearest grassy tree area is about 400 meters from my house. It felt like they were right beside me. And also, I have a dog that barks at anything, and the dog was completely silent. The second time was one day when I went to sleep. Right when I turned off my lights, I heard the exact same sounds. I went to my sister's room which is right beside me, and she was awake reading with her window wide open, and my dog was there also. I asked her if she heard anything, but she said no.

But when I got back home I was like, does she hate me? Did she think I was annoying or too loud or obnoxious? I know it sounds irrational. 

All I want to do is be comfortable and put myself out there more without feeling too worried about what other people think. I know that takes a lot of work and commitment.

28,"The second I have any time where I let my thoughts be, I start thinking about how everything I have and everything I have accomplished is nothing more then a sand castle that could easily fall apart with the slightest touch. The only way I’ve been able to escape these thoughts is when I’m reading, playing video game, eating, or doing school work. I don’t know if I’ve gotten addicted to these things and these thoughts are a consequence of that addiction or if it’s just normal. One of the reasons I feel like everything is liable to fall apart is that I’ve never put all my effort into anything, I’ve managed to half ass my way through 19 years of life riding of the accomplishments of other while making it seem like they were my own.  For example I’m doing research for my collage during this summer and my paper was so heavily edited by my professor who was working on it with me, I honestly don’t believe I can call it my work anymore. I half ass everything, I’m trying to learn a language in collage and I know I’m not giving it my all and I fear the second I start my second year of this language my new teacher will find out and I’ll fail. I really wanted to go abroad to the country which language I’m learning and eventually move to this country. But still I can’t motivate myself to do more then the bare minimum and I do want to do more but the second I do I get struck with this incredible laziness that I can never seem to overcome. I don’t know if I’m just week minded because I’ve never really experienced failure in anything I actually care about. so I’m scared that I will never be able to a accomplish anything because of my half-assing. I’m afraid that I will fail at everything and the moment my incompetence is finally revealed I will never be able to recover from how far I will fall because I will most likely fall hard. because of my ability to only do things half assed I’ll never be able to get up from that fall. I’ve got some other depressing thoughts but they all branch of this main thought. I’m really sorry for my bad grammar I wrote this as a rant as well really quickly because I’m terrified of dwelling on these thoughts.

He decided to change his lifestyle and figure out his personality but ended up depressed and lonely. He started texting the girls who went to the same school as he did and got blocked by all of them. He fell into deep depression then went to the psychiatrist with his father and was put on anti depressants and had seen significant improvements. He realized that he had bad habits of smoking, watching pornographic materials, stalking girls, messaging girls online, and masturbating and he depended on smoking to gain confidence because he was always a shy and anxious boy.He still has a long way to go to improve himself and build his selfesteem up.

- [ ] Socialize more

- [ ] Build his self esteem
- [ ] Respect his parents

Azat fell into deep depression, got professional help, is now doing better and realized what made me fall into depression. Depression will always come back, unless you make changes in your life to be happy. Happiness has sacrifices, are you willing to fight for it?

I want you all to understand something critical here. A man that has cancer suffers. He goes to the hospital for treatment, then has a choice to become a good patient by changing his bad habits that causes his cancer in the first place to increase his chances of survival, or keep eating unhealthy and make bad choices, smoking, drinking, partying and stay cancer positive.

Depression will never go away, you have to work on it everyday by making right choices. Understand what got you depressed in the first place.

Or say stuff like you're too bright to keep that knowledge to yourself, why not share it with the world.  Because an open mouth lacks a focused mind.

So i began developing anxiety since i was 14 i think ? I had big attachement issues because of the fact i never had friends before.  
When I was 15, i had a really toxic best friend, and when i escaped from her i was very depressed and began selfharming rarely and having suicidal thoughts.  
It can of faded away, when i was 17, just falling again very deeply sometimes but it stopped being the 24/7 thing.  
Then when i went to college, i was far form home because of some application problems, long story...  


That's when it all started going down. Feeling suicidal, empty, anxious all the time, 24/7...  
It went one for the whole year, i don't wanna get into the details, but i barely survived. I went to see a psychologist that year but not seriously, only 4 times...  


I went on for the next year being kind of good, because i transferred and have been able to be closer from home. I also entered in an association, and have been way more active than before, overall, it was good. But i still had huge breakdowns and ended up having 2 suicide Attempts that Year...  


So last October, i decided to really  take my Mental Health in hand, and i went seriously to Psychiatrist, took medication, have been more open to my parents about all the f\*\*\*\*\* up behavior i was having.

I got diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety disorder, Depression and Agoraphobia.  I worked really hard,  so except some breakdowns (The last one being  in April, because of Quarantine's stress) i am really good.  
Like, feeling normal good. And  i am really happy about that. I even came in peace with all the shit that happened to me in the past.  


Just, i had that weird idea, and i wanted to know if it was common and if someone felt the same.  
I kind of miss all the shit. I kind of miss self harming, and feeling suicidal. I don't know why or how, maybe it was with me for so long that pulling it out left a hole ?  
I don't want it back, i didn't consider it as an aesthetic or anything. I just felt more myself that way ?

I like to think that I am a pretty smart person. I've always done well in school whenever i applied myself to my work. But i've always had troube with communication, a lot of the time when im talking i think that im talking cleary but it comes out as a jumbled mess and I don't even know that it happened.
Someone could ask me 'Do you have an extra pencil'
And i think that i answered 'Let me check my bag'
But it comes out incoherent without me even knowing.
I've found somethings online and i beleive it to be some form of 'aphasia'.

The other thing that i'm not sure about.
There is a lot of times where i have a word, or the name of something on the tip of my tongue but I cant remember it. 
I get a feeling of frustration and when i get frustrated i feel the need to crack my neck, or fingers, or pop my jaw open. I guess they are kind of like Tics. But they only happen when i get frustrated about something.
 Or there is times where i have to do really fine motor movements like thread a needle or put a very tiny screw into something.
If i cant get it in i feel a very strong physical tension or frustration. and i cant stop popping my wrists or weird things like that.
It doesnt happen all the time but it happens often enough that it is very upsetting. I have control over not cracking my joints and stuff when i feel frustrated, but if i dont do it for long enough i feel very very uncomfortable.

I have suffered from multiple concussions.

I don't know if this post made any sense but i guess im just looking to see if this is a normal thing. And if not if there is any answers for it. 
Its like when i get frustrated over something i get this feeling over my whole body that i need to stretch, but it doesnt go away, or i feel like my neck needs to crack but when i do it doesnt stop the feeling. When i finally figure a problem out or think of the word the feeling goes away.

There was one time recently where i was trying to remember the title of a book that i read in middle school. But i could only remember very vague parts of the storyline. When i was looking for it and couldnt find it and couldnt remember more about it, it frustrated me alot to the point that i couldnt do anything else without thinking about the book. I texted old friends to see if they remembered, called my parents, and couldnt focus on anything else until i had figured it out. I know its really weird haha

Now I’m here, I’m safe, I’m okay, but I’m terrified. I have endless anxiety attacks and have started dissociating just about every day.. I can’t get this fear of the present and the future out of my head. Every aspect of life seems horrifying. I feel so lost.

50,"Hello,

First post here. I have been on zoloft for 10 years. Things have changed and my doctor convinced me to finally try out an anti-psychotic. I've always been against it, but I do want relief. So I got the courage and took 2.5mg of Abilify last night. 

All was fine, I knew it could act as a sedative and it will take 2 weeks to get used to. However, what happened the next day was overwelming.

I woke up sorta groggy, but my blood pressure is usually low on a new medication for the first few days. So I got up slowly and enjoyed my coffee. An hour later I felt awake and began doing the household chores but nausea was slowly creeping in. 

Around 10 or 11am I was so incredibly nauseous I thought I was going to get sick. So I forced myself to slowly eat a turkey sandwhich. The nausea got worse and I could barely keep my eyes open. (Sleep doesnt come easy for me...Side effect of PTSD).

It became overwhelming so I told my husband I was going to lay down. He knew then that was odd. I easily fell asleep and 2 hours later my husband comes to wake me up so I dont have issues sleeping at night.

Apparently I woke up in a panic reenacting a bad dream. I came to consciousness and felt so confused. I couldn't tell if I was dreaming or sleeping or really what was going on. 

After I woke up he left the room and I fell asleep again for another 2 hours. When I finally was able to sit up I groggily walked to the living room, my stomach still reeling.

I drank peppermint tea which helped a lot! I could begin to feel the medication leaving my system and coming back to normalcy.

I never would have expected this from one dose. I realize meds take a while for your body to get used too but this was wild for me. Has anyone else had this issue or do you all think this is normal?

I'm thinking about calling my doc but it feels so silly to have a reaction like this on a small first dose.

Any advice is appreciated.",23Jul2020,1
51,"Can I be happy


I’ve haven’t been able to feel happy for any extended period of time for months. During the last few months (Marchish) I was in a relationship that was very important to me and was the only thing that made me happy and want to wake up. She was the first person I actually loved. Yet no matter what happened or how much we talked about it I still couldn’t be happy with myself and things I did in the past. And I fell on and off with it and had weekly breakdowns. In the end we broke up (a month or so ago) and I don’t blame her because I am such a fucking mess. It has been weeks and I still feel void of emotion, more so now, because I literally have no one and during the time of that relationship I lost all my friends, even my best friend who was mad because he dated her before but didn’t tell me. Everything got so fucked up and I lost my world when we broke up, even if I wasn’t happy then. And no matter what I do I still can’t be happy for more than a little bit. It is a fact of my life that I ruin what ever makes me happy. In the end I always end up making everything worse. I want to believe I am a good person deep down but I know I’m nothing more than my actions. Everyone says it gets better but it hasn’t and I don’t want to wait for it to. The only times I’ve been able to feel anything is with pain and I’ve given up a lot. I can’t sleep anymore because I have trouble falling asleep and I’ve had nightmares for the past 2 weeks. Everything has just fallen apart and I want to be happy.",23Jul2020,2

I just feel so bored in life, and if I wasn’t here it wouldn’t effect anyone except maybe my mom and dad. I’m not suicidal, I just feel my existence is pointless. In about May, I started to feel better, and I got into marching band, but that novelty wore off quickly, and now I feel like I fell right back down into the rabbit hole. I try to express how I feel like if I wasn’t here it wouldn’t effect anyone to my friends, and they just say stuff like “yes it would” and then they don’t give and explanation why. They just pass it off and then go on with whatever they were doing. I feel like it annoys them when I try to reach out for re-assurance that I matter, and I just feel like a bad person for reaching out some times.

58,"Hi! This is my first post but this is something i’m curious about. I see my feelings more than i feel them. 

Ever since i was younger I have always SEEN my emotions more than i felt them. Now i was recently told that i mostly likely suffer from  depersonalization. I depersonalize when under anxiety &amp; stress, but even before then i was diagnosed with that or even depression or anxiety i’ve always seen them. 

I will explain this the best way I can: 

In head I know if i see a single person in the middle of a desert by themselves i’m feeling lonely. 

Or confusion is someone flicking through the radio when going through a tunnel. 

Annoyed is someone accidentally sticking themselves with a needle over &amp; over again. 

Moments before i depersonalize i’m able to know i’m about to because the image of a tv filled with a colorful static comes popping up in my head. 

Anxious an image is those red flashing sirens going off. 

For the longest I thought it was normal because my therapist were able to understand me from a young age as well as my nana and my best friend has always been able to translate the description of the image into an actual emotion when i needed it. The only person who couldn’t was my mom, and i figured it was because we never had a (healthy) relationship. 


These are only a few, but does anyone process their emotions this way.

If you know what this is called or even have it, please let know, is this not normal?",23Jul2020,2
59,"The word crazy has a lot of weight to it. It has been used in society to dismiss the actual feelings of people and invalidate actual medical issues ESPECIALLY in women. There are so few studies on women's health, especially when it comes to female health, because their emotions were deemed ""too crazy"" to be actual symptoms. And mood swings are related to so many significant medical issues.

Also just think about how the word is used. It's used to define something so unusual to YOU that YOU would never do that, say that, or think that. 

So many ppl suffering from mental health illnesses just want to feel validate like any other person. Many of us call ourselves ""crazy"" to put ourselves down or believe ourselves to be unworthy of friendship, acceptance, and love.

I am not perfect and will admit to using it in my vocabulary. But, I have appreciate a dear friend who said she was trying to get that word out of her vocabulary and it made sense to me.

All I hope is that this sparks something for you. Instead of that word, say what you actually mean. Expand your vocabulary. Be able to state specifically how you feel about the thing or person you're talking about.",23Jul2020,0
60,"hi i’ve never been diagnosed w anything because my father didn’t really believe in mental health and we couldn’t exactly afford a therapist, but regardless my whole life i’ve experienced a pretty relentless suffering, dissociation, numbness idek what to really call it because it’s so confusing but in the last couple months it’s gotten to an especially low place. i don’t want to kill myself but i also feel like i’m swimming underwater and running out of air. like a year ago i had what i can only assume to be some kind of manic breakdown and now i’m dealing with the repercussions while also being in one of the worst depressed states i’ve been in ever. also trying to get off drugs (although i have been unsuccessful so it’s not like withdrawals are the cause of this) i’ve been unsuccessful in keeping almost any of the relationships i’ve formed since moving out of my dads and being on my own. it’s not like i did anything wrong to anyone i’ve just isolated myself so hard it’s like i’ve vanished from the world into my own reality and because of this i also feel like i may have been having delusions like i obsess over certain numbers being messages to help me and i’m not convinced that anything is real anymore",23Jul2020,1

62,"My mental health has been a spectacular dumpster fire lately, but this one new development is worrying to me. I have huge issues with feeling alone and being alone, up until 2 years ago I've been nearly completely emotionally isolated, to the point where I lived more in my head than I did out of it. I just got out of a serious relationship and lost my job all at once, so I've been very, very stressed and my fear of being alone kicked into overdrive. My best friend was an amazing help but her life has started picking back up so she can't keep coming back to help me, and I'm not doing very well on my own.

In the last week I've noticed when I'm not paying too much attention to the room around me I'll start to notice movement or sound, and I assume it's a dog or my friend, then I remember I live alone and I have no dog and I quickly look up and the noise diasapears. Not only that, it feels like all noise diasapears, I become acutely aware of how empty and still my apartment is. It's strange because whenever I hear the noise or sense movement I feel a little more comfortable, and I know it's because I feel like I'm not alone at that moment, and then when I look up I remember I am and I start to feel bad again.

My grandmother lived her whole life with schitsophrania so I know what that looks like, and this ain't it. Now I've heard voices call my name or a conversation in the other room when it was empty before, but we're talking like once every 4 or 5 months, so I don't think that's it. I honestly think it's my head doing whatever it can to stop being alone, but idk if that's it or not. If anyone has any insights I would greatly appreciate the advice.",23Jul2020,3
63,"I've been wondering this for a while. A few months ago I was very close to being forced to take a suicide risk assessment and I've always told myself that I would lie about how I felt if I was ever in a situation like that again (saying that I dont not feel like that, even if I did). What would happen if I did lie? Would I get in trouble? Would people be able to tell that I was lying?",23Jul2020,1
64,"I’m not seeking help. I guess in writing this I just want people to at least see some of me because I’m so tired of being reserved. Even if you still can’t fully understand me, because words alone are not enough. Although I am curious as to what kind of illness/disability/disorder I have, which is also why I’m writing this if anyone has an idea. I split it up into parts because it’s not just one thing.

1. I think I might have what you call apathy. I don’t seem to have familial love, or any kind of love relating to personality and character at all (as well as companionship). Not from hate, but like a robot; I just don’t have it in my brain. I’ve never felt love for my family or had the drive to make friends or get into a relationship. When a family member says they love me, I feel nothing and Idk what to say. Or if someone dies—like say the death of George Floyd for instance—I don’t feel anything towards it. No hate to the cop, no remorse for Floyd, etc. I just don’t seem to care; I’m always neutral. And I have friends but Idk why I still talk to them. I don’t try to call them, hang out with them outside of school, and I don’t feel anything when they tell me something like “thanks for being my friend”. But despite that I still talk and laugh with them so Idk, maybe I have companionship to an extent, but not on an emotional level. And going back to love I still seem to have love for certain things, or at least a very strong attraction. Like the outside (https://images.app.goo.gl/yApKtKi4ed9MUrAd8) for example: I feel a great attraction for beautiful environments like that. I just feel very happy and warm. And for romance it’s the same thing: the attraction I feel for beautiful environments is the same attraction I feel for certain females I find beautiful (real girls and fictional girls (mainly anime girls)). But just their appearance; like I said, I feel nothing for personality. So it seems I love things, but not people. Although sometimes I do feel bad for my family. Not from love but just from imagining it from their perspective, because I know how much they love me, even though I have no feelings towards them.

2. I can’t comprehend humans’ way of thinking and just how your brains function. Morals, going to school, getting a job, how you look at art, movies and shows, why you feel certain ways towards certain things, why you feel importance in certain things, why you celebrate certain things, etc. I’m just so alien because I can’t comprehend these things and I don’t feel these things myself. Like when I watch shows/movies I see people go on about character development, choreography, visuals, etc, and I just don’t comprehend. My brain doesn’t see all that, and neither does it find entertainment/satisfaction in them either. I don’t feel importance in a lot of things like school (I’ve been out of school since September of 2019), contributing to society, having to attend a wedding, etc. Although I know that specifically has to do with philosophical conversations I used to have with my friend in where I learned most concepts are manmade, in which I lost the feeling of importance in a lot of things. But that’s not the entire reason; I didn’t feel much importance in them to begin with. And I’m not good with speech and misuse words/sentences because I can’t comprehend how you all use them. This has lead me to get into many arguments on the internet, and me losing those arguments because I just couldn’t comprehend what they were saying and the concepts they threw at me. As well as leading people—including my dad—to misunderstand me when I try to explain things. It’s because of this that I feel very angry and miserable because no one can understand me and the concepts that I try to give, and I can’t understand people. I’ve even been called a rapist once because of misunderstanding when I tried to explain a concept. And another time I’ve been told that I was using intentionally obtuse logic, when I don’t even know what that means. I just can’t comprehend/process a lot of things. I feel like an alien amongst the human race (that’s why my name is Anomaly).

3. None of my feelings are choice. I don’t choose to be happy, I don’t choose to laugh, I don’t choose to be mad, I don’t choose to be sad, I don’t choose to be scared, I don’t choose to be disgusted, I don’t choose to like and dislike things, etc. I just am/do, naturally. Everything is just instinctual for me. It’s something my brain decides, not me. My feelings act all on their own. Every time I’d tell my dad or someone about my feelings they’d say stuff like “Don’t be so hard on yourself” or “Don’t worry about them” or just anything encouraging like that (I think that’s the word) to try and change my way of thinking, but they had no impact on me. And maybe this is why, because I’m not choosing to be this way, I’m not choosing to worry about what others think, etc. Words just don’t fix me or impact me like others.

I didn’t begin to realize these things about myself until freshman year of high school when I really started thinking (which was last year; I’m 16 now). As well as being on social media more and more and realizing just how different I am from humans. Over the past several months I’ve began to spiral into a deep, negative and broken mental state. And half the reason for that is being around people on social media, and honestly just people in general. But I just can’t get off it because... Idek why. Idek why I’m on these places and have the desire to make posts when I’m so alien from everyone. But I also feel very lonely, and I want so bad for people to understand me and see my concepts. I don’t want to be thrown out of society like trash without anyone having ever seen my pain. I don’t want people to continue to think of me falsely (like that one person who called me rapist). I just hate being the only one that’s like this and I have yet to find another. The number one thing I desire now after all of this is to live in my fantasy world that I’ve created in my imagination, which I also write about in the Samsung Memos app. I just want to be in my world where none of you exist, and it’s just me and my imaginary significant other, and the beautiful world around us (remember I said I still have attraction for certain things, just not people; I have this strong love for beauty, like I explained earlier). A world with none of these things for me to worry about anymore. I’m hoping that when I die I get to go there—like some kind of afterlife—and finally be free and at peace. I can just live how I want with no people or anything holding me down anymore. I can be fixed and no longer mentally broken with these thoughts. I can forget all the pain and forget you all. I know it’s not an absolute certainty, but I believe the possibility is there. I know for a fact that I have a mental illness/disability/disorder of some kind, but Idk what. I haven’t had any kind of past trauma or anything like that, and my parents have treated me like any other parents. But I have a good feeling that it was caused by my own birth, because when I was born I came out with a pin head like an alien due to coming out head first I think, and the doctors had to reshape my head back into its original shape. Even though they said they didn’t find any problems at the time, I’m positive they missed something and that something went undetected, and now I’m like this. I mean that was all the way back in 2004; technology has much improved since then. But again, I’m not seeking help. All I want now is to leave this world and be in mine. This just isn’t the right reality for me.",23Jul2020,1

67,"after a recent sexual incident I started to become very touch-starved and always searching for external validation (e.g sex), I ignored this for a while since I began hooking up with various people and started to date one of them very recent after that, not giving myself time to heal.

depended on him a lot for my happiness. We are ending our relationship soon, on good terms, due to his personal reasons.

This has happened to me many times.

I’ve had twitter for several years but I stopped using mine a while back because I lost interest in twitter and enjoyed Instagram/snap chat more because all my friends were on there. Recently, one of my colleagues at work kinda pestered me a tiny bit to get back on twitter and his reasoning was that it’s great for politics and you find out a lot more on there. So I go back into twitter a few months back (maybe since April/May) and I keep seeing posts related to sa /r*** and it triggers me every time. 

Today I saw a post which wasn’t directly related to it but kinda was where someone shared a guys message/blog upload or whatever it was saying he enjoyed harassing girls (in simple words) and installing fear in them because it meant that he wasn’t any longer a random face in the crowd, that he’d be remembered if he was stalking girls etc. Ok that shit has happened so many times in my life where I’ve been followed or harassed on the streets. I kinda want to share them with someone because I feel like I’m currently suffocating under all that trauma and I can’t. I haven’t slept all night.

Everything about you is *so* god damn perfect. As I'm sitting there looking at this masterpiece in front of me, I take notice of your hair. Soft, brown locks spilling down a perfect 5 foot 9 frame. Images of that hair being intertwined in my fingers as I bend you over the kitchen counter briefly flash through my mind. I smile. You smile at me, and suddenly my heart fucking stops. The moon and the stars have nothing on that smile of yours.

Suddenly, everything shifts. You're not mine anymore; you never were. The memories, the fucking memories are still there.. but you aren't. The ones of us hugging and kissing in your closet because we knew work had to be done but we were so intoxicated with each other. Having sex and making out in your bed for literally hours on end. The sweet feeling of having your body wrapped in mine, caressing your head and softly tucking loose strands of hair behind your ear as I kiss your forehead. Dancing in the middle of the kitchen.

Finally, and most concerning for me, I’m having random mental “cuts” where if I turn, look around, bend over, or take a step it’s sort of snaps me to where/whatever I was looking at (I’d best equate it to strobe lights in a dark room, with everything feeing very choppy for just a second). This is often followed with very, very minor lightheadedness for just a fraction of a second and then everything returns to normal. 

Has anyone experienced similar symptoms, or if you know the actual terms for these could you let me know so I can better verbalize them to my doctor?",23Jul2020,2
84,"Pretty much, on paper, my life is going amazing. I am a full ride to a great school, I have a partner who is siping that respect women juice and loves me and makes me feel loved, and I am advancing very well in school, my mom accepted my sexuality, my sister is talking to me again.... it's great....really.....  
if it's so great though, why do I miss memories with people who mistreated me? Why do I want them in my life even when I know they will only bring me pain? Why do I want to give them my 100% even though I know I have it good right now, and I know the people who are from my past who didn't treat me well, they aren't doing so hot. I want to be there and make them happy, but I know neither of us would be if I brought them back in my life. I doubt they'd want to come back in my life. It's easier not to text them,  so why is it so hard to want to reach out for their support? Why do I feel so shit without them even though it was shit to be with them? help please.",23Jul2020,2
85,"Hello, so I’m 16, as I’m sure your well aware, usually almost all people my age go out to parties, have heaps of friends, drink, smoke. Get high. Do dumb shit. Sleep around. All that sorta stuff. But I don’t desire any of it and I can’t understand why the people around me so and it causes me so much anxiety. 

Let me start out by saying, I do have a decent group of friends. Not because I desire them, but out of necessity. I don’t like that I do, but I do need people in my life other than family to talk to sometimes. I do also have a girlfriend, she is great and I love having her in my life. 

But, that’s where it ends. I have never smoked, I have never consumed alcohol, I’ve never gotten high, I’ve never gone to a party, I’ve never done any stupid shit with friends. Never, I don’t desire to either. I want absolutely none of it in my life and i actively try and avoid it at all costs.

But, it causes me so much anxiety when the people in my life do. My ex girlfriend left me because I am this way. She wanted to smoke weed with friends and go to parties and stuff like that. She can do that all she wants. I just want nothing to do with it, I don’t understand why people find enjoyment in that. She could see that it upset me but she thought me getting upset was pathetic and she ultimately left me. 

My new girlfriend is much more understanding and more like me. She’s very introverted. But that being said, she still goes out with friends sometimes. Last night she went out and broke into a building sight and skated around. Her doing that caused me so much anxiety, not because of the fact it’s illegal. But because I felt so shit about myself because I don’t desire that in the slightest. When I saw her doing that on her story it made me feel sick. 

Same with my friends, my best friend decided to get extremely drunk the other night whilst we where on a camping trip with my family. The whole time I just wanted to run away and go home. Only reason I didn’t it because I didn’t have my car there. But I just don’t understand it. 

Every time I watch movies or TV shows and see people partying and getting high I get so much anxiety. 

I understand that 99% of young people do all of those things, they all desire that. It’s everywhere and you can’t escape. But I fucking hate it. I despise it. All I desire in my life is to stay at home, in bed with my phone. That’s all I want. That’s where I am now and I love it. I just can’t stand all of this partying and substance consuming that young people do. Especially when it’s the people around me. 

But most of all, I feel shit and hate myself because I hate it so much, why am I like this ?? Why don’t I desire any of that ?? Literally everyone else my age is out doing that almost weekly so why aren’t I ??? Why do I stay at home and watch movies with my parents when I should be out high as fuck with friends???? I just don’t desire it but I don’t understand why it causes me so much anxiety when people do.",23Jul2020,37

87,"TL DR at the bottom- I have PTSD, just as background info, and have started fostering my 16 year old sister who after several years of DHS battles was finally removed from our abusive parents with her own sets of mental illness and trauma. My husband and I have done our best to establish boundaries and avoid situations where she'll feel triggered or controlled. That's (especially recently) feeling like a futile effort. Its been 2 months and she's picking fights with me more and more frequently. Apparently my husband is a trigger for her too, she's made several snide comments about how nice it must be to be married and how if she had what I had she wouldn't be depressed so she can't fathom how I still am. It hurts, but I don't let these comments define our dynamic and I do my best to listen meaningfully and acknowledge her insults without becoming defensive. Yesterday she picked a fight where she saw a dakimakura in my room (SFW, I just have a lot of pillows and stuffed animals) and she said how when we were kids I never dated because I was so full of myself and prudish in an attempt to make her look bad (I'm 23 so this was when she was like 13 at the oldest maybe) I told her things change and part of growing is becoming comfortable with yourself and I don't condemn anything she's done. She began escalating and yelling at me, really hitting every trigger I have. I went to my room to get away and she called me to continue yelling. I let her continue and told her we were going to have to make sure we aren't having arguments everywhere and if she has something to communicate or vice versa we should come back to it and talk later and have it out when we both can calm down and prepare first. She claimed by ""scheduling"" talks I'm devaluing her feelings and she wants to be able to communicate in whatever moment she feels the need to. I told her when she can do so without yelling  we can talk about it. She yelled about how alone she is and how I have someone when she doesn't and how unfair it is. I told her she needs to respect my boundaries in order to live in my house, and that everything I have done in this is for her and she needs to acknowledge that I have needs too and cant live in fear in my own house. I then went to work without a resolution and reached out to her caseworker. My husband also sent me a vent post she put online a bit later.  It's  long but I'll post it here:

""My sister was making fun of me for being 16 and of having sex already and that was whatever I get shit all the time but she was whooping and hollering last night with her husband and so I made a joke about it when she was bashing me and she started just saying how at least she was married and how bad she has it and how dare i joke about her relationship and I said it was just a joke and that at least mom didnt kick her out before she was 18 and she was telling me how I didnt even know how bad things were for her and how I had it easy and needed to stop being a little bitch about things when she was the favorite child and our mom never hurt her whereas I got constantly hurt and locked out of the house and my mom literally told me about how she should have aborted me and all this crap and meanwhile half the times my ex and I did anything was when i was unconscious and when I didnt want it but I guess I'm a slut for letting it have gone on so long and then she was picking on me for my body the other day saying I look like a hooker and need to wear a sports bra and I feel like I'm living with my mom again minus the physical abuse and I kinda wish I was homless again but I hated it and I dont have anyone irl to turn to and I feel so alone all the time and I hate how I always feel so shit and I hate how everyone who's supposed to be there for me hurts me and I just want to feel happy and the only times I feel happy is when I'm online  or alone but really i hate being alone but it's better then being with the people around me""

I read this and felt sick because its 100% untrue. I literally fell asleep watching a movie that night, no fornication occurred.  And second I was beaten and emotionally abused daily by our parents and got married at 18 to escape, not the favorite by far. Additionally I would never do any of this nor did I say anything that could be interpreted as instigating.  Especially the parts where she claims I body shamed her because I absolutely never have, even growing up. 

My unfiltered perception is that she's pretending to be hyper mature, she has had one ex boyfriend which believe it or not, is my brother in law. And she bounces between the abusive ex and true love narratives faster than I can track. She places my husband and myself in the roles of my mother and father even though we are as far from that as can be. She is very self important and refuses to acknowledge anyone elses needs or boundaries and thinks the many kindnesses she's been extended are owed to her. I pressed that we go to group therapy, but she refused. I can't make her. What else can I do? I'm seeing a therapist personally for advice and am enrolled in multiple courses on the topic. I feel like the only one reaching across the aisle. Any advice is appreciated. 

TLDR me and my sister got into a fight, I have a parental role in her life as of recent but she doesn't respect me or seem to be improving. I can't convince her to attend group therapy or even listen to me. I feel like I'm trapped with my past abusers all over again. What can I do?",23Jul2020,1

90,"I feel that just by writing this out, I might feel a slight sense of relief. I apologise if I ramble on and don’t provide enough info, but hopefully you lovely people can dissect and figure out what advice to give. 

I’m 30F, have suffered with anxiety, depression and panic disorder since age 18/19. I have been on prescribed medication quite a bit in the past but I have now been medication free for approx 18 months. I have also had therapy in the past, psychiatrist, mental health counsellors, EMDR therapy and CBT. 

At the moment so much is happening. I have a very poorly relative (stage 4 cancer and palliative, very newly diagnosed) and I am the only one in the family able to take charge and deal with everything. I’ve had to take time off work to be able to do this, this is my 6th week off. I do have a very supportive family. I also have a very supportive partner who I live with. 

I’m just starting to feel like I’m not doing a good job of handling everything, between my relatives needs, supporting my family, normal household tasks at my partners house etc. No one is telling me that I’m not doing enough and that I’m not good enough. My partner is being so so good and telling me not to worry about things like dishes, housework because it can wait because there are more important things to worry about, but I still feel bad inside that I’m not doing ‘my fair share’. I haven’t done any basic ‘self care’ in weeks except for the basics (showering, washing my hair, brushing my teeth etc). I feel exhausted and drained. I’m not sleeping very well as I’m worried about missing a phone call or being needed at my relatives house on the few nights where I don’t stay there overnight. I’m also don’t have a very good appetite, I’m trying to make myself eat enough to keep my strength up but it’s a real task. If I nip out to go to the shops I typically try to stretch it out, I guess for some ‘alone time’ and usually end up having a bit of a cry in the car outside before going back to where I’m needed. 

We are still awaiting a community care team to be put in place, which hopefully will provide a bit of support. 

I just don’t know what to do. I’m worried about recommencing medication incase it leaves me too drowsy to be able to do what I need to do. I’m worried about trying to see counsellors incase my appointments would clash with other obligations or incase I miss phone calls etc. 

Thank you in advance for anyone who replies and gives some advice/support. 

TLDR I feel like I’m hitting a brick wall, my anxiety and panic is heightened but I’m also too worried to seek help.",23Jul2020,1

94,"Well it’s been a while since my last post here. Things were legitimately starting to look up since my last one. But as per usual things came fill circle.

So here I am at 3 am thinking poorly about myself and my situation once more. I can’t stand my family anymore, all my parents ever do is argue. My mom doesn’t work and we can’t survive without my dad’s income. I just want to graduate and go to college already. I can’t stand being here for another second, if fills me with stress and anxiety I can’t get off of myself.

Well yeah, here I am on this account venting about how bad everything still is. I was really hoping that things would stay positive, but alas that couldn’t last. At this point I’m even starting to doubt I’ll even be able to afford college or a good life after graduation. 

One other issue I didn’t mention in the original. A lot of my old friends turned out to be complete garbage human beings and now trash talk me behind my back, and tried to ruin something I worked hard on. I blocked them on everything and they can no longer contact me, but it still hurts to remember the good times with them.

But whatever the case, thank you all for listening to my complaints once more. I just can’t bear all of this anxiety, stress, and paranoia anymore without someone noticing.",23Jul2020,2
95,"Okay, I have had the worst experiences with the system. When I was 6 years old my mother filed for divorce because her husband who isn’t my father but I didn’t know that till this year was beating her all the time and hitting me. So he swore revenge and told my mother he would take what matters most to her and said he would have me taken from her. He lied to the system and told them she’s crazy and unfit and back then it was really easy to do that and get a child taken away from a parent. I was placed in a residential campus home called kidspeace but the name is the opposite of it because it was kids hell. They sexually abused and brainwashed us every day. They illegally gave powerful psych medications to me at 6 years old. I got out after four years and was released to my Mother but my father found a way to have me taken a second time by telling the system she had stopped giving me the medications they had me on and told her to keep giving me. I was only 10 and had been forced to take them since I was 6 and they were powerful and messed me up a lot. Then I was placed back in kidspeace because they didn’t listen to my mother even though she tried desperately to tell them the meds were hurting me. Then after a year and a half they placed me to live with who I thought was my father, the ex husband who my mom divorced and who had me taken from Her and got me put in kidspeace both times. He physically abused me brutally and called me names that destroyed my confidence completely and made me know I was worthless. He broke my toys and used to take my stuffed animals and spit on them bite them and stomp on them again and again and would bring them up to his face and scream curses names and insults and threats at them and then turn to me and pull out a knife and scream “run stupid aspergers kid or ill fucking kill you!!” I do not have aspergers or any disabilities but I was believed to but it turned out to be being caused by the medications they were making me take making me so hazy and slow I appeared to have mild autism. He had me drugged up so bad for the 6 years I lived with him and then I went to go live with my mother when I turned 18. I wasn’t allowed to contact her before then because he convinced the court system she would be a negative influence on me but all she ever did was shower me with love and nurturing. When I came to live with my mother I had a lot of anger and depression built up from the years I was abused that started to come out and certain repressed memories started coming forward. Whenever I go to the hospital they put do on medications that fog my brain up and make me slow and hazey and awkward and make me feel a thousand times worse and I end up having to lie and say the meds made me feel better to go home because they hold me against my will if they think I’m not going to stay on them. They only hurt me I’ve tried every single one over 40 different ones and they all make me feel aching arthritis like pain in my body and joints as well as stiffness all over and blurry vision, dry closed up inflamed throat, make me feel like my insides are rotting and clogged and rock hard calcified and make my skin dry and ubearably uncomfortable and allergic to its own oils and my hair oils. Worst of all they all make me hazey and either a zombie or like I have aspergers. I feel my brains getting raw and inflamed and hardened when I take them and it’s torture. I lose all my social skills when I take them and become awkward and bizarre and off beat and my chakras close and I can’t flow. 

I want help but I know they’ll just drug me again. They don’t listen to anything I have to say and act like I don’t know what I’m talking about and they are going to do what they want nomatter what wether I like it or not. They are dismissive and rude when I persist and plead for them to not medicate me. They refuse to listen or respect anything I say. What do I do?

111,"I guess I'm just confused because it has happened quite many times. When I experience matters first-hand that upset me *greatly* (ie. familial confrontations), I feel like I can't control my crying -- I'd cry on and off for like half an hour or more (I guess, I didn't really time myself) and sometimes find the typically effective way of distraction (ie. music) doesn't work. It'd take some veritable time to calm down which makes me question if my emotional reaction is normal.

In situations where I experience people's emotions vicariously, it'd trigger in me a strong emotional response and cause my eyes to swell up at first. I guess at some point I just start making associations to my past experiences... and since I made the start with a little sobbing, I felt the liberty to whimper like a kid and at some point, it gets a bit out of hand. I did that just yesterday night and I felt that I was being so melodramatic and even forgot why I was crying in the first place, which confuses me more.

Is this I should be concerned about or is it just that I'm a bit more sensitive?

As an adult, it has turned me into a joke. People make me a joke, belittle me, call me a creep, make rape jokes, women, at least the ones that don’t sexual-ize me, are often uncomfortable around me, like I’m some kind of predator.

Despite some of these things, I’ve lived a decent life. I’ve gone to college, travelled through the world, I’m now bilingual, physically capable, you know, things that others desire to have or do, especially those who come from where I have. 

I had a bad upbringing. I grew up in a terrible neighborhood, horrible family drama, neglect and was very isolated in school. 

I’ve managed to cope well. I’m still here, but it’s like I’m moving along life seeing how much damage I can take from life itself. Thats left a mentality that I will eventually take my life when it becomes too much to bare.

It’s not going to be now, but I have a feeling it will come down the line, maybe a decade. That means that I have some room to improve, some room to get more help.

Has anyone else here felt like this?

I’m not even depressed. I just find this to be the most logical solution down the road.

I’m looking into TMS, hypnosis, and CBT.",23Jul2020,9
119,"It seems that everyone around me has something wrong with their mental health. My best friend has cut, and I have a friend that is not so close that keeps coming to me with her problems. It used to be said in a very joking way, but in the same way, you can tell she is not joking. Today she openly admitted to me that she tried to kill herself. The conversation went something like this;

I was reading on my own, because my best friend was sick and I had nothing else to do. She came and sat next to me, and it was just quiet for a bit. Then out of the blue, she said ""I tried to overdose last night."" I sat for a moment, dumbfounded and I closed my book, which I meant as in indication for her to continue. She didn't say anything though, and she looked to be on the verge of crying. There was about 30 seconds of silence, and I did not know what to say. I usually freeze up when she does this, which makes me feel really horrible. I just sort of said ""Sorry?"" She said it again, and I couldn't think of anything to say, and once again I hated myself for not being able to say anything.  There was another few minutes of silence, and then she said that she didn't think she was going to survive her suicidal tendencies, then laughed, which I thought was crying, and said she was tired, but that it was probably her meds kicking in. I said that really, her being tired and her sleep meds making her tired amounted to the same thing, which was her being tired. Feeble, I know, but I could not think of anything else to say. Then she said that she was likely to end up in a psych ward. Then some of our other friends started laughing, and they said I looked scared, which I probably did. The friend was looking at them, and they were laughing at me. I tried to motion to them that it was serious, but they missed it repeatedly. Then my friend had to go get her laptop from the I.T department, so I went over to the other friends, who are way closer to her than me, and told them. They got serious immediately, and they will keep an eye on her I suppose.

Please. I have no idea how to help her. I'm not a therapist, I'm Fucking 13 for god's sakes. I have no clue why she comes to me, we barely know each other. I have resolved to talk to her next time this happens, because just shutting down must make her uncomfortable and would make her regret coming to me. I feel terrible for her, her parents are being horrid to her and I have not done anything to help. I got home and told my Mum, and she has sent an email to the head of year about this. I dont know if this was the right move, but I can't go back on it now. I just feel so guilty about her, and how I don't have anything going on at home, and how I'm not depressed like everyone else seems to be. Why should I live perfectly happily when people who are more compassionate, caring and selfless than me put up with their struggles, and I can't even bring myself to talk to them about it. I feel like I have betrayed her by telling Mum and our friends. Only 2 of our friends know, and they will keep it secret, 100%. But it isn't about me being guilty, that isn't as important as helping her, and I am going to do that from now on. Please, if *anyone* knows what to do, tell me.

121,"Background info on him: He’s 28, depressed, been single for awhile, drinks, consumes weed(smoking, vaping, edibles), doesn’t exercise, plays a lot of video games, doesn’t have any other hobbies, stays inside most of the time (even pre covid), eats pretty healthy but slightly overweight and is very unfulfilled. He’s had thoughts of suicide before but I don’t think it’s major concern right now. Although I don’t think it would take much for it to become a concern. Which might make it a concern?

Background info about our relationship: I’m 19, so a decent age gap. No other siblings. He’s struggled with depression for most of his life and I’ve struggled with it recently. We are pretty close since neither of us have many friends and play games together on discord often but most nights now because of covid. We get into arguments semi frequently but they don’t last longer than a night to a couple days. Part of it may be because he’s frustrated he has to hang out with his 9 year younger brother.

He vents to me about work problems, stress, lifestyle choices, family issues and other problems that may arise. I always listen to everything his says and make sure to do my best to make sure he feels heard and feels better but sometimes I try to give him advice. I’ve recommend he goes to a therapist, get diagnosed for other mental health/illnesses, change some of his life style choices. Every time he shuts them down. I think some of it may because he thinks I’m young/inexperienced but mostly because he’s stubborn and thinks he is right most of the time.

He doesn’t want to go to a therapist because he said something like he doesn’t want to open the can of worms because he thinks he’ll unravel. Which is kinda like a, yeah you should definitely go. He also has said that he’s been prescribed medication before but he didn’t like it and doesn’t want to do it again. He self medicates his anxiety and depression with marijuana but lately I think it’s been adding to some of his panic attacks. He doesn’t like his current career (working IT at a private school) but because he doesn’t have a college degree and hasn’t done much else besides customer service, he’s not sure what else to do. Money isn’t an immediate problem for him right now but he doesn’t have enough to stop working for awhile or go on an extended break. He’s tried looking for hobbies and done aptitude tests but hasn’t found anything that excites him. The only thing he’s passionate about besides games is being a sneaker head which he has a large collection of shoes.

I’m not sure what to do to help him but I definitely think he needs help and something needs to change. Either with him, the way I approach him or both.

Please ask me to clarify anything as I’m sure I left some things out. And sorry if this breaks some rules or isn’t fit for this sub, I don’t post a lot.

127,"At 1 AM I received a text from my mother asking if I had been purging in the toilet. I was very confused because I hadn’t at all, not since January. I told her I hadn’t and she said it was okay as long as I was telling the truth. 

For some context, I have been struggling with bulimia for a year, my parents found out last summer and all hell broke loose. Ever since then I have never been trusted and I’m always the brunt of food-related jokes, particularly from my brother. Sometimes he uses my past of bulimia to blackmail me so he can get away with stuff and that’s pretty low of him to be honest. However, I am fully recovered and I no longer feel the need to binge and purge anymore. It’s been great and I feel so much better but nobody believes me. 

He told me today that he went into the bathroom and it smelt like a burrito (I ate one for dinner last night) and there was a layer of oil on the surface of the water which he told my mum about. I’m so confused because I know for a fact I didn’t purge and I feel like I’m going crazy. 

My dad found out about it and he said he believed me but I’m not convinced. 

I don’t understand at all, I have honestly not purged at all and it really hurts because I have worked so hard to get better and everyone thinks I’m a lying nutcase. And it doesn’t help either that my parents relationship is falling apart at the same time, my mother suspects I have done it because she and my dad were arguing last night. 

I have asked if my sister if anyone was feeling ill last night and she said no so I’m being framed. It’s literally driving me insane and I can’t stop breaking down about it. Am I doing it in my sleep? Have I done it and forgot about it? Is my brother trying to get me in trouble since he knows my parents don’t trust me? I’ve even considered the idea that my brother has made out that I have purged so my parents will think that their relationship is hurting everyone and break up (my brother despises his dad). I’ve literally thought of so many theories and I feel awful, I feel like I’m lying even though I’m telling the truth.

~I don’t have a moral compass-or well one that works
~I don’t care about my family members...Which is quite weird because they really haven’t done anything to me-like I couldn’t care less if something happened to my mom I just would feel shiz
~I have one (1) singular friend that I don’t even talk to that often, most of the time I just hang around people that are somehow beneficial to me but those are more of just acquaintances than anything
~I just don’t c a r e about people in general they can do whatev

1. Not trying to start a gender debate or imply that mental health of other genders is less important.

2. Mental health itself is a very serious topic.

3. It is high time we stop undermining male mental health by saying things like ""Man up dude!"" or ""Don't be a pussy!""

4. Addressing mental health issues sensitively is better than trying to find out 'What went wrong' or 'Why a certain individual took the extreme step (suicide)' and regretting it later on...... because clearly THIS IS WHAT WENT WRONG.

142,"I’m a 21 y/o girl and for the last couple of years i’ve been dealing with major anxiety and panic attacks. since i let it get so bad i then developed depression. i only managed to find a doctor who’d listen to me properly in January 2020. she diagnosed me with panic disorder and depression, and suspected i had a mood disorder.

at first i just had the standard sertraline 50mg once a day, then increased to 100mg. it was fine for a couple of weeks and then i started to have a tremor. i now take 150mg of sertraline daily, 80mg of propranolol and 10mg throughout the day just to keep my anxiety low. it doesn’t do much for the tremor i have anymore so i’ll speak to my doctor about that. 

the thing i’m curious about is now i’ve started these meds and my body is getting used to them etc, at night time, or any time i’m in silence, i can hear voices? it’s usually a female. i can’t understand what she’s saying but she’s yelling and sounds scared. i can’t control the voice like everyone can with their mind so i’m worried. my doctor is already worried about me, and i’m nervous to tell her about this as well. i don’t want any new meds. they already make my dreams so weird and vivid that i get them mixed up with reality and i’m so tired all the time. 

i can’t say i remember having this voice in my head before the medication, but my memory is so bad that i can’t be certain. it gets to the point at night where i think it’s either my mum shouting or the neighbours so i have to get up to check. the other thing is that her voice sounds like it is coming from the other side of the room. it’s not far away, but it’s not close enough. it doesn’t sound like it’s coming from inside my head. 

i have my usual voice in my head, just like everyone. then the woman, but only when it’s quiet around me or  when i’m in bed. i have another voice, but i can control that one. it’s almost like i have two conscious voices i can control. for example i could hum one song with one voice, and sing another song with the other voice. but this woman is completely out of my control. i doubt i’m schizophrenic as i don’t have any other usual symptoms and i’m aware that medication can bring on weird side affects but this is such a weird one to me that i’d love to hear everyone’s opinion.

151,"I was diagnosed with depression 2 years ago and have also survived a suicide attempt. It was easily the worst phase of my life. 

I am from a country where mental health problems are considered 'attention-seeking' behaviours and parents are embarrassed when people start finding out about their childrens' problems.

Back when I was admitted to the hospital near where I study, my parents had to fly in from abroad. When they got there, they barely spent 2 hours with me. I literally lay in bed in an empty room for 3 days, with only the guard who was assigned to look after me.  Instead, they bought gifts for my college professors and went around meeting everybody in order to 'save face' and 'explain themselves'.

Even after I was discharged, I was never able to have an open conversation about what had happened. I had bouts of crying, of anger, of frustration; but none of that was taken seriously. They took me to a psychiatrist but they were the ones who spent half an hour talking to him in his office trying to 'change his mind'. Finally, when he called me in and spoke to me (barely 10 mins), he said there's nothing wrong and I'm not depressed. This was barely 5-7 days after I was discharged from a hospital for attempted suicide. 

After that, I somehow managed to get better. My boyfriend helped me through a lot and I got better academically and I even topped my year at college (I'm a med student). But throughout this period, I've always had a nagging feeling that I'm falling back to where I had been. My mental health is so fragile. I don't know if it can be called depression, but I just don't feel normal. 

Fast forward to 2020 and this pandemic. I spent 4 months alone in my dorm room since my parents live abroad and international travel had ceased. Everyone else had gone back to their homes. I got through that as well, although it was a struggle. The entire time I thought that once I get back home, maybe my mental health will get better. But now I'm back and it doesn't seem to be so. 

I feel so overwhelmed all the time. I want to cry, yet I never do. There are times when I'm super stressed about the future and my upcoming exams, but other times I just don't care. I feel like a zombie. I can find no purpose in my life. I know I have people who care about me, especially my boyfriend - but I just feel so dead inside. I know I won't ever attempt suicide again, but I keep hoping that everything just ends. I don't want any of this. 

The problem now is to get real help, which I can not do as long as I'm living with my parents. The memories of the time after my hospitalization scare me and sadden me and I have given up any expectations I had of my parents understanding me.  

I don't know what to do so I'm just living each day to get through it. I just wish I had someone to talk to, but I'd feel too guilty talking to someone close to me lest I burden them.",23Jul2020,1

The staff members of my law school were asked to call the students to inform them of the orders made by the ministry which is basically ""explain the nature of the situation to the students, ask them to respond or they will have their programs cancelled""

The staff member that called me was so incompetent that I had to just say yes to whatever she was asking me. She told me I had to come to the school to sign a paper and that's it. This was confusing since for the past couple of months everything was online. Plus this means I had to drive a 45 minute drive to just sign a paper and wait in a very tight and probably crowded place just for a signature.

Ever since the Virus had reached my country I haven't gotten out of the house. probably 3 or 4 times in the last couple of months so I kept asking for an explanation but I had no answer. This made me so aggravated that I stayed mad for two days. Then came the anxiety where I kept doubting if I was on the wrong and if I was the careless student.

The day after another staff member called my friend and explained everything and every point to my friend. The staff member said that the law school had no power over the ministries decision and that they had to call every student. This made me even more mad since I had the right to know about all this but the person who called me said nothing to me and made me feel like I had no option but to agree.

So I then sent an angry email to the department responsible claiming that the person who called me didn't explain to me and that I had the right to know.

After sending it I feel extremely anxious feeling that I was rude and that I have no right to be upset. Is this normal?",23Jul2020,1

because i keep having “episodes” of feeling-down-period ,, i think i might need to get properly diagnosed and get informed for better ways to treat myself .. but im quite nervous about the test/assessment itself mostly because i never really put my guards down in front of other people and i know to get accurate result i need to be as open as possible .. also i dont know anyone whose been through the same situation to go for advice ..

I just wanted to share something with you all, not even sure if this is the right place really. I suffered with severe social anxiety for most of my adult life and always felt instant fear and revulsion at the thought of interacting with people, so I would lock myself away. Recent lockdown has emphasis my introverted side to the point where it was negatively affecting my life so I have been trying to reach out in the only other way I know how, through playing music. I’ve found it to be incredible cathartic to speak to people this way and I’m gradually crawling out of this social anxiety hole I dig myself with each video. This one has really helped and has became almost a breathing exercise for me, doesn’t really feel like playing, but a way to completely lose myself for a few minutes and it’s really helped. I just thought someone on here might enjoy the moment with me and if you suffer from any kind of social anxiety, feel free to reach out. If I can I’d love to help. 

Have a lovely week everyone.

161,"i dont know where to talk about this and i dont know if this is the best place to do it. ive got pretty bad ptsd thats just completely wiped most of my memory so occassionally i'll just remember something (sometimes good, sometimes bad) and i remembered a pretty shitty story today (well like an hour ago)

so the tl;dr on the backstory is this guy liked me, i rejected him, i started to like him back, he started to act toxic so i stopped liking him and i dont wanna talk about it too much but he weaponised his mental health so i'd date him and feel like a ""hero"" for ""saving him"" as well as belittling my mental health at the same time. i found a screenshot of a convo we had, he sent a photo of him c\*tting himself (him knowing i need a tw for that) with the quote ""love me more than i hate myself.""

the memory that it started with was that i used to be popular on this forum board and i made a forum on it (i've since been banned and the post was deleted so i cant go back to see what it actually said) but it was pretty much me coming forward about how someone on forums was abusive to me cause i rejected him and everyone decided to side with him cos he was trans. i dont know what i expected when coming forward but i was hoping he'd get banned or something similar.

but that instance is why i cant get any of my abusers in trouble for what they did to me cause i came forward about something genuinely traumatic and everyone found **any** excuse they could to **not** side with the victim, i'm now fixating on all the excuses people will come up with if i were to come forward about it to any of my other abusers.",23Jul2020,1

165,"Right now, I'm okay.

Last week, I was not fine. Everyday, I was thinking of ways to kill myself. Searching for drugs that I may die of overdose, looking for where can I hang myself, crying a lot, thinking I'm a burden to my friends and family. Looking at the knife, thinking if I should cut myself and looking for blades. Losing interest and appetite. I was scared of myself, on what I might do.

Two nights ago, I told my mom that I might need therapy and we cried together for that night. I didn't tell her anything apart from I want to kill myself. From that night, I began staying at a different room, apart from my mom. She buys me snacks that I like and don't bother me that much anymore.

I'm fine right now. She told me I was just overthinking. Am I really just overthinking? Was I just looking for attention? Did I just needed to let it out once? or do I need therapy?

Also, the feeling of a burden to my family kinda stays. Therapy is around 25-50$/hour (pricey for my family and I'm from the PH), because both my mom and dad needs operation and we don't really have an income this quarantine.

168,"Hi, I’m just looking for some reassurance. I’ve just been diagnosed with OCD (Magical thinking). This basically i means I think my thoughts and compulsions can alter reality / what does and doesn’t happen to me.

My OCD is not compulsion specific, it’s thought specific - meaning it doesn’t matter what action I’m doing (getting dressed, drinking water, closing a door a certain amount of times, going not going somewhere etc) what matters is the thought I hold while doing it. 

My world has completely shrunk because every time I move it becomes a looping compulsion. Also, I tell myself (for example) if you drink a coffee today *insert bad thing* will happen.

The problem is, my “bad thing” (I.e my OCD’s worst fear) is going to purgatory and bad things happening on a loop for eternity, which, unlike some other facets of OCD I can never disprove.

My therapist said as a matter of urgency I have to start going against these thoughts (because they are currently stopping me from doing things like eating and drinking) and she reminded me this is just a construct in my head. Unfortunately, with this type of thinking I can’t “start small” as everything is a compulsion and everything is linked to my biggest fear. I hope someone can understand what I’m talking about.

Basically I’m asking for some reassurance. Am I supposed to go against the thoughts, and just have faith? Or am I supposed to appease the voice forever and live in this mental prison, just to stop bad things happening to me until I die? 

I very soon will have no choice than to either start going against it, or lie completely still in my bed for the rest of my life.

Can someone help me?",23Jul2020,1

172,"I’ve been struggling with my mental health for the last 3 years now.

For context, I have very strong self-esteem issues. I have a suspicion that I have depression and anxiety, as well as a superiority complex, though I’ve never been professionally diagnosed due to the stigma of mental illness in my family, I had a bout of eating disorders which was exacerbated by my mum who strongly upheld our culture’s beauty standards (east asian). I still hate my body, though I don’t have any EDs anymore. I’ve had suicidal thoughts and come close to it, though I’ve never actually attempted.

Recently, I feel so tense. I’m forgetful and I feel like I don’t have any control over what I do. Also, I feel like it’s worsened by school since I’m considered “academically advanced” and my traditional asian parents expect a lot from me. I have a professor who I particularly dislike, the mere notion of attending his classes make me nauseous but I need his subject as a prerequisite. I feel out of touch with my friends as well, and I feel like our interests don’t align any more. I’m often overwhelmingly tired these days, and social contact feels like a chore. I don’t enjoy the hobbies I used to, but maybe that’s because of exam stress. 

I feel numb and overwhelmed at the same time. Sometimes, I’m so sensitive and will cry at the smallest provocation. Other times, I can’t connect emotionally and don’t feel anything when I should. For instance, I know my little sister feels pressured by my parents because she feels as if she is in the shadows of my own academic achievements, but I don’t feel anything for her even though theoretically, I should even because I love her and I understand her situation to an extent. I’m swinging between feeling too much and not enough and it’s draining. 

But here’s the thing, maybe I don’t have any mental illnesses, and I’m making this up because I unconsciously romanticise the “aesthetic” of mental illnesses or something. I’ve never been diagnosed or been with a professional. I don’t really know anything and I just feel sort of numb.",23Jul2020,1

Life has been better than ever after all the abuse and depression I've been through. I stopped cutting after I cold turkey quit my meds almost a year ago and my depression was better as I felt I had made enough distance from all my pain. Even the nightmares got better after awhile. 
So the year goes by

I hold a good relationship of about one year and I currently have two jobs (one of them allows me to work with animals and the other allows my to build things. Both of which I love. Schools out for the moment which takes away stress (I'll be a junior) 

But about a week ago I started hurting myself again because I've just been in alot of pain. I'm not sure why though. All I know is that after the day is done and I have dinner with my love I come home and I just sit in the dark hating myself and feeling so pent up. The only way I feel in control is by hurting myself. I know I'm not the one in control when I hurt myself, I'm addicted to it in a way. Simply because I always need more.

At my second job I keep eyeing the power tools because I hate being away from my razors all day. I don't want to die or anything I just crave cutting and burning myself so bad. 

I haven't told anyone I relapsed... I don't think I have the courage to tell anyone.

My biggest fear is that I'm depressed but I have no reason to be and that I'm simply stuck in this pain.

I go outside, I eat healthy, I excercise, I still have a little bit of down time (not a whole lot tho), and I have people who make me happy.

185,"Can you help me with this? Advice please!

Hey, so I’m under the care of an incompetent (NHS) Psychiatrist, whose communication is poor and he is ill-informed with regards to MAOIs. I have Treatment Resistant Depression (he disagrees with that) &amp; OCD. I have been on; all the SSRIs, Venlafaxine, Clomipramine, Bupropion, Bupropion &amp; Fluoxetine, Vortioxetine, Modafinil &amp; SSRI. Vortioxetine &amp; Pregabalin over a ten year period. 

I had a Second Opinion with Dr Kaul and she was clear in her communication and we agreed that Moclobemide &amp; Aripiprazole might help. I received a letter today and in it my Psychiatrist, Dr Ahmad Zadeh, has said he’s still not satisfied with the Secind Opinion, and listed reasons why he will not prescribe me Moclobemide and Aripiprazole. I have my own disputes regarding his points, but I would very much appreciate advice on this and what to come back with. I am meeting with the Clinical Director on Monday and I want to go in their fully armed to respond to them. Here are Dr Zadeh’s reasons;

“1) MAOIs are old and rarely used antidepressants that can interact with foods that contain tyramine and cause hypertensive crisis. Therefore, patients should avoid consuming tyramine containing foods such as cheese and yeast.” 

“2) Some of the very common side effects of Moclobemide are dizziness, headache and hypotension. Reported to Dr Parkin on 17th of October 2018 that you had some dizziness when standing up. You also reported to Dr Kaul that you sometimes feel dizzy, lightheaded and faint and these symptoms can worsen by Moclobemide.” 

- I never reported this to Dr Parkin and I definitely did not say it to Dr Kaul during my Second Opinion. These are lies to support his reason not to prescribe. He really is a foul man. 

“3) You reported to Dr Kaul that your main concerns are obsessive thoughts and fears. Moclobemide is not an evidence-based treatment for OCD and it is not recommended by any guidelines.” 

- I reported that OCD is affecting me more at the moment, that doesn’t mean I don’t have depression which can be made worse by having OCD! 

“4) Dr Parkin, your previous Responsible Clinician made a diagnosis of moderate depressive episode with rumination thoughts in April
2019. You were reviewed by Dr Kalkan on 11th September 2018, Dr Tailor on 1st of October 2018, Dr Bangaru on 16th it August 2019, Dr Zadeh on 10th of September 2019, Dr Kaul
On 9th of July 2020 and none of these doctors documented any objective evidence of depression including abnormal speech or low mood. Furthermore, you reported to Michael Swan on 6th of June 2020 and Dr Zadeh on 11th of June 2020 that your mood has been improving since September 2019 as you have been with your girlfriend. We understand that you have been feeling depressed for a long time but there is no sufficient objective evidence that you are suffering from treatment resistant depression. You declined more evidence-based medications with better side effect profile for treating your OCD and depressive symptoms and you are insisting to get one of the MAOIs.” 

“5) You have frequently requested to change your medication and you have been on many licensed and unlicensed medications including Paroxetine, Clomipramine, Vortioxetine, Buproprion, Fluoxetine, Modafinil with minimal effects. We do not feel repeated changes to your medication will be helpful.” 

“6) You did not engage with non-pharmacological treatments including The Network and therefore you were discharged from this service. Psychological treatment and engaging in activities combining with evidence-based medications are the most effective treatments for mental health problems including OCD and depression.”

186,"Hello friends. About 10 years ago I had a major anxiety episode which lasted for about 6 months when I wasn't able to sleep at all. Eventually I saw a Dr who initially prescribed Beta blockers which helped to dial down the anxiety and then sertraline to further help with my mood.

Mostly, I've been taking sertraline ever since then. As high as 125mg a day, currently on 50mg a day. I've also had lots of great help in terms of talking therapies and those close to me comment on the extent to which I am different (better) in my attitude and the way I process things which used to cause me anxiety or depressive incidents.

So a few months ago I decided it was time I try to come off sertraline. I was coping well. Changed jobs without mental health issues, was coping with the Covid situation OK, etc. I was going to take it really slowly: spend a month on 50mg/25mg every other day; then a month of 25mg every day; a month of 25mg/0 every other day and finally completely off.

Things went OK in the first month - but at the start of the second month I started to notice I was losing my temper more easily. I was aware of this happening and was putting in effort to try and handle this as it happened. However, by the end of that second month, I felt I was becoming far too quick to get angry - responding more angrily than the situation merited - and really struggling to keep an even temper; snapping at my kids, arguing with my wife, etc. The effort of controlling this felt like too much for me to handle. This was a common issue for me pre-sertraline or on the occasions when I'd stopped taking it in the past decade.

At that point, I decided to stop the withdrawal process and just go back up to 50mg/day and things soon got back to ""normal"" in terms of my mood.

My question is this: are the above experiences typical for sertraline withdrawal? Is it a case of asking those around me to be tolerant for a while until I'm completely off the drug, at which point I'd be able to cope? Or do I need to put more effort into controlling my anger ""manually"" until I get used to doing this again?

Or, is that a sign that the underlying ""me"" isn't ready to cope without sertraline? And, if so, is this a question of more talking therapy to help me more, or accepting that I'm someone for whom a  maintenance dose of sertraline may be a long-term necessity?

I guess I worry that there's a third option here which is that, underneath, I'm just an angry person and the sertraline is masking this and I have to just accept it and hope those close to me will put up with it!",23Jul2020,1

193,"Background information: I’m 17, my little brother is 6, my mom used to have depression


She is currently going through a divorce with my dad and it’s getting ugly. A few weeks ago my dad said something about winning the case to her and how she wouldn’t see my brother again and she had a mental breakdown. My dad being my dad recorded it. Fast forward to the present my dad is accusing my mom of being crazy. My mom is currently crying. She is severely affected by this. 

Even though my mom paid more than half the house, since it’s still in his name he’s going to kick us out. My mom paid for everything for us despite having a job that pays less. My mom risked her life twice for giving birth to both me and my brother. My mom tried everything to fix the marriage and he didn’t want to try anything . My dad doesn’t care about me or my brother even now he says he doesn’t have enough money for us even though he gets over 150k+/year and only pays for a lawyer and his own food. 

How should I try to help my mom?",23Jul2020,1
194,So I truly believe this girl is my soulmate. she recently called me to tell me how she missed me and how much she liked me after we haven’t talked for a few months. And I haven’t been able to get what she told me off my mind since. I can’t tell if she was drunk and talking out of her ass or if it’s purely platonic to her or what. But I haven’t been able to get these thoughts out of my head and I’m worried it’s driving me crazy. Last night I had a big party and drunk lots and then cried for a solid hour when I got home. It’s the first time I’ve even teared up since I was a child which should give some scale as to how much this is confusing me. But ever since that dinner everything I have done in the last 24 hours feels like days ago in my mind. That dinner feels at least an extra night ago and I haven’t been able to get my head around the concept that I only did things like walk the dogs tonight. I asked doctor google why I was remembering things like this and apparently it could be related to thinking too much. Which is why my infatuation with this girls comments the other night is scaring me so much. If anyone has had this problem before I’d love to hear your experiences or any coping methods or advice. Thx guys.,23Jul2020,1

196,"TL;DR I was going to jump off a bridge into a freezing river but realised that I was more afraid of dying than I was of living.

So I was about 13 years old and my mother caught me watching porn on my computer. Nothing was said about it but the next week I went away for a few days to do some work experience (UK scheme for kids to experience work) and upon my return I found that my computer was missing. I came downstairs to my mum and she told me that the police had been tracking my internet activity and they came to the house and took it because they suspected it to be filled with child porn (spoiler alert, it wasn't). Needless to say I was taken back by this news.

So next thing is, I find myself in a police station getting interviewed, I was being asked questions that a child should never be asked and I was just in complete shock about the whole situation. Before I left the station I was introduced to a local therapist who would 'look after' my mental health during the investigation (standard procedure for minors in the UK) .

I was taken out of school, wasn't allowed to be around people my own age or younger and I wasn't allowed in the home alone with my own little brother. All of my family members treated my like scum and I felt so betrayed by them all that they would throw me to the wolves with no second thoughts.

Fast forward about 6 months and I can't take it, I reached the point in my life where I saw no way out. I had managed to convince myself that I was a Paedophile and that I would spend my days rotting in jail, not really what a child should spend their time thinking about.

I went to one of my weekly therapy sessions and whilst talking to my therapist she said ""I'ts a good thing your mother called the police, there are clearly a lot of issues that we wouldn't have been able to talk about if you weren't here."" The whole time during the investigation my whole family insisted that the police had been tracking me and that they caught me watching child porn which led to my arrest. To find out that actually the police never even looked in my direction for anything and that my own mother called them and told them I was a paedophile really shook my perception of life. My own mother couldn't have acted in such a way that could literally ruin my life could she?

So, I decided to confront her when I got home, it didn't go well.

It was Christmas eve and she was waiting for me when I walked through the door. I didn't really know how to put it so I just said ""Did you lie to me about who called the police?"" Her face was a picture, she clearly never expected for me to find out. Her response, however, really angered me. She said ""Well yes I did ring the police, but you shouldn't have been such a pedo!"" to which I responded ""But I wasn't a pedo, I've never even encountered CP."". We argued for a few minutes and I told her that her behaviour was abhorrent and she needed to apologise. She refused and said that if I speak to her like that again that I was sleeping outside, I didn't back down and she shoved me out the front door, locked it and closed all the curtains.

I found myself, on Christmas eve in the freezing cold (&lt;0 degrees Celsius), nothing but a short-sleeved shirt, jeans and some worn-down trainers.

I ventured off into the city to figure out what I was doing (I was 13 so I had literally no idea), then I found myself at the local park. There was a large river flowing through the park with a large white suspension bridge for people to cross it. I walked onto the bridge and leaned over the side, there was a history of people committing suicide here because the river was just slurry at the bottom so once you jump in you don't get out. I knew that if I jumped it would definitely kill me.

I plucked up the courage to climb over the side, it felt like I was hanging off this bridge for hours but it was probably just a few minutes. As I went to let go, I couldn't, I was stiff with fear. I tried to let go, but the more I tried the more my hands resisted me. Then I started to think, if my hands don't want me to let go, maybe I shouldn't. The more I thought about it I started realising that I was scared of dying, the pain, the cold, the darkness scared me. I turned around and climbed back onto the bridge, I felt safe, it surprised me but I felt kind of happy to be back on the bridge.

I stood there for a little longer and contemplated my actions, it was then that I realised why I had climbed back over. \_I was more scared of dying than I was of the pain of living\_ After having a little cry to myself I walked back home, when I got there the door was still locked and my mum wasn't worrying about me at all.

About 8AM she finally opened the door and her first words were ""Well are you going to apologise for the way you treated me last night?"". I bit my tongue and apologised, but I learned a very good lesson that night \_Even when the light has gone out, giving up is never the only option\_.

To this day I haven't told a soul about this and she (my mother) still wont apologise (its been 10+ years).

Hopefully some people find this helpful in the trying times that are 2020.",23Jul2020,15

They claim they’re helping but constantly make remarks and do things that make him feel like a slave and a disappointment rather than a son. And up until a few years ago, I didn’t really know I had mental health issues and didn’t pay attention to them. We both come from families where there’s A LOT of stigma around mental health. I’ve also been abused and have faced consequences for trying to help people.

Whenever my bf has an episode, I try to help but I end up freezing. I don’t think he’ll hurt me or tell me to leave, but I just don’t know HOW to help and it scares me, because I wanna help him in any way I can.

I've struggled with mental illness for 15 or so years. I have bipolar disorder, initially diagnosed as depression and anxiety.

There have been failed suicide attempts, there have been plans that haven't been acted on but on my 27th birthday I was maybe in my darkest place yet. I was mentally and physically exhausted, trained, empty. I didn't want to die, but I didn't want to live the life I had. I was too tired. I sat with my collection of pills and bottle of whisky and stared at them to get the courage to try and get off the ride again. I couldn't find it.

I told myself, swore to myself I would try and battle it one last time, one last push to get things under control. I put the pills and note back in the hiding place, wrote myself a contract promising that if my life hadn't improved by my 30th birthday then I would do it. 

I turn 30 in a little under 5 weeks, yesterday I made the decision that I wasn't going anywhere on my birthday. I flushed the pills, burned the note and burned the contract.

My life isn't perfect, my bipolar isn't gone and I still struggle. I'm still depressed. But it's an improvement and that's all I aimed for to begin with. 
The future terrifies me. But I've got this and the most supportive girlfriend I could ask for and our daughter in the making will make it all worth it.

I used to absolutely love playing the violin (been playing for more than 10 years now) but since about 5 years, when my depression was starting to really kick in, I have been more and more discouraged. I was pratcing and playing less and less, which was very much to the dismay of my mother, who was paying for my violin lessons. Since I wasn't practicing, my playing started getting worse. Which is why I eventually wanted to play even less because it sounded horrible to me. Now, that I am out of school, I wanted to use my free time to get into playing the violin again. But I always felt insecure of my playing and ended up not doing anything. And the times I really did try to get myself to play, I always ended up having a breakdown. I was crying and just couldn't play. It feels like there is a huge emotional barrier that keeps me from not only playing the violin, but from enjoying myself and doing things I like as well.

210,"so i almost posted about this in the puppy101 subreddit but i realized, the main issue is not with my puppy training, but with my patience.

this is something every dog owner needs to learn and this is my first time owning a puppy of my own to train and take care of, i never even had a dog in our household growing up

so i know that a lot of these problems are bc of lack of consistency. me and gf are taking care of the puppy together but our methods arent exactly the same, plus the dog is technically her dad’s even tho he barely does anything to help. i know this would all be solved by communication between us adults, but communication is something i have ALWAYS been bad at. being raised mormon in the closet made me keep to myself even more than my personality already does.

and then theres of course the issue with patience. i used to think i had great patience until recently. puppy did multiple frustrating things this morning, like pooping by the stairs before and after letting her out. literally as i tried calling her over to let her out, she pooped. as i was trying to take them back upstairs after letting them out, she pooped again. a million other things plus that last poop gave me the worst anxiety attack

gf treats me like im crazy when i get anxiety over things like this. i know i shouldnt have such anxiety over it but i literally cant help it and she doesnt do much to help

i wanted to take the dogs on a walk and then go on a run, so im still in my running shoes and shorts and sports bra, walking around the house like a zombie bc i feel guilty about not doing things but the energy to do anything besides panic just went out the window

i know communication and patience are what i need in this situation but i dont know where to start i feel like im losing my mind

edit: gf isnt necessarily being a bad partner. she deals with her own mental issues and when i get like this it gives her anxiety as well, and its been happening often recently so i think her patience with ME is getting worse than the actual puppy",23Jul2020,2

1) what medical professional would be best to continue to guide my anti anxiety medication and ask about alternatives to test due to sexual side effects (trouble reaching climax)? Is my general practitioner adequate or is a specialist required?

2) my father (passed from brain cancer at the age of 54 in 2005) had a really hard time from talking to himself and an inability to ‘hear’ others talking to him. Often times he couldn’t hear us and ‘snap out’ of the story he was playing to himself out-loud. This started at around my current age of 36, and I am starting to experience the same problems. I’m finding myself blurting out song lyrics (mostly rap) and humming/muttering with others in the room or nearby and not knowing it was happening. When I’m alone I don’t have a filter and won’t notice I’m doing it for many minutes. My mother says they never got him checked out for anything but says “he for sure had a bad case of adhd” my 9yo and 7yo both take adhd meds that help them a bunch for school and home. I haven’t been worried, and maybe I’m over thinking this issue but I got on a video of tiktok users with tourettes, now o don’t think I have tourettes, but made me sick to my stomach at some of their issues and how similar their feelings were and that maybe I too have an issue I should get addressed. What direction should I go for this? 

3) my daughter (7yo) reminds me of her mother and I’m worried I am subconsciously treating her differently than her brothers because she is so similar to her mother who I’m having emotional issues with due to separation. I’m trying everyday to make this better and not let her know this is happening, but might need to reach out to a professional for help. I love her so much and I’m tired of buying her things everyday because I’m trying to hide how I feel toward her mother and not having the time to heal from my separation.

I am not really sure how to put this but let me start.

I do not have many IRL friends ( long story why) but I can tell I have been bullied a lot yet this is another story.

I have been feeling like this for quite some time but I was not really ready to talk about it. Somehow I get like mega envious and jealous at people having friends both online and IRL, it kinda goes like that, I see a friend of mine posting a photo of him being somewhere with his friends or just telling me he needs to go because he is meeting his other friends and while I never say it or even show it. Inside me I just feel like, I knew it, they all actually hate me, they are just friends with me because they don't want to hurt me and so on. And then as far as online friends go, so many people my age have friends online from all around the world ""from gaming"" and I actually take pride in the fact that I have quit gaming as it turned into an ""addicting"" habit with me. And another thing is, I know there are other communities as well that could accept me and I try to be active in other communities both online and IRL that share my interests and I rarely make friends there.

And when I make them it's again that feeling ""I am not their only online friend of them, they have others as well, I am not special for them in many way, judging by the amount of followers, the likes and followers they have, the other friends they have are more plenty, and more important to them as I am. They probably just talk to me because they feel sorry for me, or they will just ditch me because I am not as perfect as their other friends are.

Another thing is, Like people meeting up with their foreign friends when they travel to their country and then posting about it online. Well I have tried it once and like out of like 10 people or more one was down for it. I don't know  like even that seems to be hard for me and I barely even get accepted. ( I am LGBT BTW) Like I understand that I am probably sentenced to fellow LGBT and ally friends, but there are so few and I am so freaking done of people having many bad friends or having no friends at all and then complaining about it and when I offer themselves to be friends with them, they say no because I am LGBT.

220,"First off I should state that where help and or treatment is available then take it. It cant hurt to try. My advice will not help everyone but for some I hope this helps. Now for the few like myself who has never been able to get any doctor etc to listen and give said treatment Ive developed a rather unique solution that has helped me.

Some back story first. For near 20 years ive been chronically depressed, stressed out 24/7, been self harming since, just in general cant cope unless im home alone enjoying the peace and quiet because i just cant deal with the world in general. Im sure you get the point.

Now for the first 10 or so years of fighting these issues I fought and struggled to deal, mostly alone, treating my issues as an enemy to be fought and conquered. But then at some point several years ago I had a slow epithany, that has helped me dramatically, even though no professional would ever dare suggest it.

For me the solution was simple, rather than treating my mental health issues as an enemy I choose to treat them as a friend and accept them as a part of what makes me me. In my mind my issues are now simply a part of my personality no different to anything else that makes me the man I am. 

Now ill admit i still struggle with life, still self harm etc but by accepting this is who i am and making peace with my issues I am a hell of lot happier than I have been in years. And if I have a bad day and or decide I need to burn myself well I just chalk it up to a bad week and I move on rather than pondering the why of what caused it, its just who I am! 

By accepting this simple fact I have removed alot of the stress and worry in my life and now im just happy to plod along doing my thing in a far better mind set than i ever thought possible.

Again this advice will not suit all but if it helped me then I'm sure others may benefit from this simple solution of acceptance.",23Jul2020,0

When I was around 14, I started smoking pot which became a daily habit for the next 7 years. Entering high school, my overall quality of life greatly improved. I made more friends, got better grades and was more exited about putting lots of hours of hard work into developing difficult skills. About 9 months ago I quit smoking out of fear of the harm I may have been doing to my developing brain and lungs. I've always had problems with intrusive thoughts interfering with my ability to focus and work but over the past 7-8 months it has gotten to the point that I no longer desire to do any of the things I used to find enjoyable, namely playing guitar and writing music, because when I sit down to focus, my mind wanders and bombards me with horrible thoughts. I have also dealt with a fair bit of restlessness throughout my life. I've always had weird compulsions like pressing the tips of my fingers against hard surfaces to feel the pressure, flexing different muscles in my body to feel pressure. Usually with regards to those two I have to do them evenly on both sides of my body to feel relief. If I bang a elbow I have to bang the other one, etc. Also things like, If I get a sentence stuck in my head I would count the syllables by flicking my tongue back and forth in my mouth and would have to do it until the last syllable landed with my tongue on the right side of my mouth. All this weirdness comes from this often hard to bear feeling of restlessness and tension. Can anyone can point me in the right direction as to how I can learn more about these issues? Is this conversation better had with a therapist? I just want to enjoy doing hard work again.",23Jul2020,1

228,"Hello all,

I broke up with my ex girlfriend about 2 months ago and I am struggling with one thing.

My ex is telling peers and mutual friends that I caused her PTSD and Anxiety from our relationship/breakup. I’m sure she felt anxious after the breakup, as I did too and I’m fairly certain everyone has some degree of anxiety after a breakup. But the PTSD is really upsetting to me. I made some mistakes, and I no doubt hurt her emotionally, I feel bad about some of the things that lead to the breakup, but I truly do not know what I could have done that caused her PTSD. 

Our relationship was somewhat toxic now that I look back on it with clear vision, and I do not want to go back to her. I have done a good amount of work on myself since and was doing great until I heard what she is telling people. 

All of this said, is she indirectly gaslighting me through peers and mutual friends? I am seriously calling my actions in the relationship into question, and it’s been keeping me up at night. It’s so weird and it’s truly an awful feeling. 

As I said before, breakups are caused by emotional damage and we both no doubt caused eachother some damage, but I really am not sure about the PTSD aspect.

I feel like I’m either a bad person, or I’m going crazy.

The thing is, everything is looking up for me - I completed my 2nd uni degree, got a job that I enjoy a lot. But I feel this stupid and harsh feeling of guilt, each time I let myself enjoy, that I am happy.

It's so tiring, but I am always on a verge of tears, thinking that I am living a really good life, when my parents / family never got the chance to live like this (right now in my country there are lots of education possibilities, young people earn good pay, no need to save money so I can buy nice things, etc).

I know 100% that none of my family members feel some kind of regret / jealousy because of me (they are vocal about how proud they are of me), but I constantly stop myself from enjoying life, since I really love them and think about if they are as happy as me.

I know this may sound very stupid from afar, but I am seriously struggling - where does this thing come from? Have you ever had a feeling like this? Or what do you think this is?

so im a transgender guy (yes this is important). before i came out to my family, i started to notice these violent impulses i would get to hurt others and myself while i would have panic attacks. i would also say things like \`\`im gonna kill myself\`\` while having these episodes and i would always regret it later along with other things i said as i hate it when my mom worries about me. so when i came out to my family, it was neutral (besides my dad screaming at me), then three months later when i asked them to start calling my my new name and pronouns, it was pretty bad. they said some very nasty things and shut me out for a while, one of my siblings even telling me they didnt want to hear anymore. this made me hate myself and fall into a depressive state. for about a month or two every morning i woke up i would count the hours until i could go back to sleep. i would constantly have panic attacks just being around my family and i would think about suicide very very often. i soon started to develop a hatred towards them, though i would never show it. just being in the same room as them made me so angry. i would always think about how much they hurt me and i would get mad when they were happy, it just upset me how they neglected me. i didnt just want to kill myself because i was depressed, i also wanted to get back at them, show them what they did to me and make them suffer exactly how they made me suffer. that all happened in april (i came out around january i think). and i still feel very uneasy and angry around them. they have shown little improvement, still calling me my birth name and female pronouns. but my anger has since then gotten terrible. i have nearly hurt my mom several times. i would normally go to the bathroom and take a old floss container and bash it onto the floor until its in peices, but im running out of things to break and im afraid i will hurt someone or myself. if i dont give into these impulses, i will normally have a bad stomach ache after and feel sick for an hour or two. everytime i have an episode i always hate myself after as im generally a really kind person. 

i seriously have thought of running away, commiting suicide and hurting others.

please, dont try to explain to me that its \`\`hard for them too\`\` because i know that. i wasnt forcing them to accept me when i came out, i gave them resources and explained to them what its like to be transgender. i didnt straight away ask them to call me my new name or pronouns, i gave them 3 months and even then, i didnt force them too, even though it was fucking killing me being called my old name and pronouns. and what they went through is nothing compared to the hell they put me through.

im getting professional help from my therapist and psychiatrist so i hope i will be alright.

**I fully realize that this isn't a diagnosis.**

&amp;#x200B;

My mom (Who's an RN) said that she thinks my grandma (my dad's side) has some sort of Bipolar Disorder (She doesn't want me to tell her though as she isn't sure). Her reasoning is that my grandma has an unusual amount of energy for her age (63) and because she cries so easily (she acknowledges this and tells us to ignore it when it happens). My grandma has always been super fun and I always felt that she had 10x more energy than my grandpa (who is somewhat healthy and has a normal amount of energy for his age.) My mom also thinks my dad acts strangely. For example, He goes from super nice and considerate to angry, frustrated, and irritable for no apparent reason in what feels like a heartbeat. I think this may or may not be due to him drinking alcohol daily, but my mom drinks more than him (4-7 beers a day) and she doesn't have mood swings like that. Then again different quantities of alcohol affect different amount of people in different ways. Also my dad sometimes drinks fluids with more alcohol content than my mom drinks so who knows. Also back to the original question, do I have Bipolar disorder? I ask this because, just like my grandma, I cry very easily and when I try to stop crying I can't stop. I am also very easily irritable (in my opinion) compared to other people I know outside my Family. Also I think I had depression two years ago (I hate saying that because of how loosely people use that term just because they are temporarily sad). I was never officially diagnosed with depression, but I was very sad, hopeless, and felt like I couldn't do anything right for a period of around 6-9 months. I did have a few suicidal thoughts but never seriously thought about killing myself as I felt things would get better. I don't know if the following information matters whatsoever but here I go.

250,"TW: Suicidal thoughts

I've always said, the lowest point of my life was late 2016. I was alone in my room, 3am, crying my eyes out because I was the closest I have ever been to committing suicide. I had it planned, I knew exactly what I was going to do. I truly believe if I had pushed myself to get out of bed, I would have went through with it. 

It was the lowest point in my life, and absolutely terrifying because at times like that things like ""what about my family?"" Dont even matter anymore, it it broke my heart. I was so scared, it was almost as if I didn't have a choice...like living was not an option. I had to just lie down and force myself to sleep, and escape the pain. Thankfully I came out of that period alive.

However recently I have found myself in a similar low point. I want to die, everything is so utterly overwhelming and sad in the world. I have nothing to live for. I have my family yes, but even then it just doesn't feel enough somedays.

The wost part...? I am not sad. I am not sobbing myself to sleep because I want to die so badly. I am not crying for the life I have and what I'll miss out on. I'm not sad at all. 

I am calm. I walk round with a smile on my face, enjoy watching movies and Netflix to fall asleep, read some books. Everything is normal and fine...seemingly. But I constantly want to die. Like last time, I feel ready for it. I am not so afraid of death anymore. I'd welcome it. Now...that terrifies me.

It's scary to realise you don't care anymore. I'd actually welcome some sadness right now.

251," 

(Some information to know: I am diagnosed with ADHD, and I'm on a *very* high dosage)Since I started highschool, my parents have been trying to get me to go and get a job, start driving and other things of that nature. I struggle with keeping myself motivated enough to even do the basic chores I have to do around the house and it's causing my parents to fall apart. My Dad is getting so stressed out and worried about me that he has to be put on anxiety medication, and my Mom spends a lot of the day crying about me. My Mom and I had a conversation in which she was in tears, panicking and telling me that she was worried that at this rate I'll end up homeless and drinking myself to death due to my problems with impulse control and quantity control. Ever since this I've had pure and utter hatred for myself, and getting so frustrated with myself that I've stared punching (and in turn bruising my legs and thighs) I don't believe I have depression, and the only explanation I have is that it's hard for me to motivate myself because of my ADHD, but that's kind of just an excuse/crutch I'm using to I don't have to face the reality of the consequences I'm presenting for myself. I had some problems with self-loathing in the past but I've hit a new level and I'm unsure what to do.

Some other things I've done that have sparked these feelings include:

Putting my younger sister on a public discord without thinking about how I could've put her in danger, which really upset my parents.Venting and complaining about my parents to friends, basically spitting in my parents faces (which is making me wonder if I should've made this post in the first place honestly)

Treating everybody in my home poorly, and not spending time with them because I would rather stay in the safety and comfort of my computer where I'm not doing anything wrong or hurting anybody, which is also an issue and causing the entire house to suffer and crumble.

Yelling and getting emotional about times when my relationship isn't going so smoothly and dragging my sister into things she doesn't have to be a part of, and ruining her entire life because she is learning bad habits from me that I *want* to have because I thrive off of chaos and drama, like the grandmother on my moms side who abused her.

Being such a disaster and a mess that requires so much of my parents attention that they can't focus on my younger sister, causing them to just leave her behind in the dust because of me.

I'm at a point where I don't have any tolerance for myself, and I'm not sure what I need to do next. Therapy isn't an option, and medication isn't going to fix the fact that I'm lazy. I can't undo any of the damage I've done, and trying to show that I'm working on things and changing is very much so a ""too little too late"" type of thing. How can I forgive myself?",23Jul2020,2

259,"So, I'm very scared and feel very helpless, and I don't know what to do in this situation, so I'm asking for help. This will be a bit long, so I apologize, but I think it's vital to know the story. TLDR at the bottom. 

**Full version;**

I \[M29\] have been together with my SO \[M31\] coming up six years now. I moved away from my home country five years ago to live with him and his mum in the UK, and I love him more than anything in this world. He is the funniest person I know, and always goes out of his way to take care of me, his mother, and his friends. If you ask him for help, he will do anything in his power to help you sort it out, whatever it is. He is also the kind of person that if you go to a party or a dinner he instantly get everyone to love him. He gets along like a house on fire with my family and friends, and I can't believe how lucky I am. 

However, he has had a long and very harsh and complicated medical history. When he was 16 he suddenly got [meningococcal septicaemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningococcal_disease). Luckily he was staying with his aunt, who's a doctor, at the time, and she manage to get him to hospital and basically saved his life. But as a result he has had a lot of troubles coming after.

When he was about 21, they discovered that he had a growing [AVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_malformation) in his leg (basically the bloodvessels keep tying more and more nots on itself until it's a big ball of it), which they had to remove. It was a very hard surgery, and his mum has told me that the doctors almost lost him because of how much blood he was loosing. He pulled through, but had to be in a wheelchair for a couple of months before he could walk. He recovered, but a couple of years later had to redot the same surgery as the AVM had grown back, though with an easier operation this time.

About a year after we met, he started having intense pain in his fingers and feet, to the point where he couldn't walk his dog or even go grocery shopping. He was told by the doctors that he had active arthritis, which was a hard blow to him since he was only 27 at the time. Because of his pain (which then spread to his back) he became very immobile and very sad, and when he feels like that he comfort eats, which made him gain 30-40kg. Which of course made him even more sad, and it's turned into a vicious circle. 

Now, the AVM came back (yet again), and his doctor seemed to not really care anymore. There were other quite traumatizing things in between (being put on the wrong medication which was killing his liver; being told he had a deadly desease and had to do a biopsy; having to quit his job and start going on benefits because he wasn't able to work), but the main point is that his doctor kept on treating him with a kind of non-invasive surgery that time and time again failed (I think he had the same surgery about 6 times). In the meantime he is just getting more and more sad, but I think to himself not wanting to admit that he was depressed, until another doctor who he spoke to told him that he was basically clinically depressed. 

The AVM was situated on his right buttock, making him unable to sit on uncomfortable seats for long, unable to close his legs, unable to walk for long periods of time because of the rubbing, and basically making him in chronic pain. Because of the pain he also can't sleep, and by now he has gotten so used to almost all sleeping pills that they don't really do anything, and he is lucky if he gets more than 4-5 hours of sleep each night. 

So because he felt so let down, he switched hospital and doctor, who has been amazing. He agreed to cut the AVM out, and after going through everything and doing loads of tests determined that all of his pain in his hands and throughout his body is linked to this AVM. So two weeks ago he finally went in to do the surgery, which was going to change everything. The surgery went better than expected, and yes he was in pain after, but it was healing fine, so after a week in hospital he got to go home, and everything seemed fine. Then this Saturday he developed a fever and cold sweats, and had to be rushed to hospital in an ambulance.

The wound was infected. Badly. The stitches had to come out, he's been on extreme doses of antibiotics and morphine, and he's been stuck in hospital by himself (because of COVID-19 neither me nor his mother are allowed to visit him). Just before I started writing this he called me crying, because a nurse had taken a photo of his wound and showed it to him, and it was bad. Going to be deformed when it's healed-bad. He was crying, saying how much he hated his body.

He has said to me before that he could never take his life, because he couldn't leave his mum like that (she's a single mum, he's an only child), but has said on two occasions before that he wished he could just go to sleep and not wake up. The last time he said this was about a year ago. But I am now getting so worried that he's not going to be able to take any more, both physically and menatlly, and I'm at a loss for how I can help. I can't even go to see him, to give him a hug and let him cry on my shoulder. All I can do is talk to him on the phone, if he's feeling well enough to answer. 

I would really appreciate some help, because I'm terrified and feel hopeless. I will do anything to help him, but I just don't know how. 

**TLDR;** My SO has had a very hard and complicated medical history, which has over half his life taken a toll on his mental health. He's currently in hospital after a surgery gone wrong, and have called me crying saying how much he hates his body and wishes he could just go to sleep and not wake up. I don't know how to help, and I am terrified.",23Jul2020,2

263,"About a year ago, this person found my social media account on Instagram and the profile seemed normal nothing suspicious about it. After a while however, they started messaging me. I took it as them just trying to become friends with me and get to know me a little. The messages started become dark. He knew everything about me. Where I lived, who my closest friends where, and a bunch of other alarming information. I then became afraid they then tried to blackmail because somehow they had pictures of me that we personal. I still don’t know how they got them. They said if I didn’t complies with his request he would post them and send it to my family/friends. I tried to get more information about him but there was literally no trace of him anywhere. I did reverse image searches on his pictures too to make sure the pictures on his profile where not from somewhere on the internet. But there was nothing about this guy online and he wouldn’t send pictures of himself or tell me any details about himself. I blocked him and told Instagram about the situation they took his profile down. But he attempted again after a while to reach out to me. Then somehow he recently added me on Snapchat by my phone number. I never gave him that information and I haven’t heard anything from him in months maybe even a year. I’m just tired of being harassed by him. I don’t want him to keep finding me and trying to reach me. I want to know who this is because I feel unsafe everywhere I go. He threatened me multiple time in the past and now all this is causing me emotional distress once again. Any advice on what I should do? Should I get a lawyer?",23Jul2020,1

I feel like I am so much slower at everything, including both school work and actual work. Everyone is so much better at quite literally anything that I feel like I have no reason at all to exist. 
When school starts back up my parents are expecting me to work, which is completely fine and understandable, but most college students can’t work over 8 hours per WEEK and the ones I’ve asked don’t have any physical or mental conditions or anything. And since I’m so much slower at everything I probably won’t even be able to work 8 hours a week because it will take me too long to do my normal school work since I’m such a slow thinker. 
My mom also wants me to start paying rent since I’m an adult (19) now and I have no idea how I’m going to be able to save up for anything. When I get my next job I REALLY wanted to start saving up for my own house so I don’t have to be around anyone else and I can do my own thing after I graduate college (if I even do). I could move back in with my dad but he lives in an extremely small house with only two bedrooms and when I lived with him before, I had to share the room with my asshat of a sister who doesn’t care a damn about me or my feelings, so I’ll have an even shittier time trying to get stuff done than I am without her. 
And on top of that, I don’t even know what job I will even be able to do when the time comes because in the town I live in, the only places where teenagers can work is fast food restaurants, which I already tried working for, and let me tell you they do NOT take anything you do seriously ESPECIALLY if you have any kind of problems like I do. 
I am on the verge of collapsing and I feel like my parents don’t understand anything I’m going through even though I already did tell them everything I’m feeling.

275,"So about a year ago when my headspace was in a really bad place I had a friend online. I was very very  attached to her; I think it was just her personality, took her lack of affection/sensitivity and blew it to a unreasonably large proportion. At the time I completely victimized myself because I would get so upset because of how she acted in comparison of my overbearing idea of ""friendship."" This led to unhealthy behavior on my part (self-harm, crying all the time). However, I have come to realize (as my mental health got better) that I was very emotionally manipulative and toxic and I probably guilted her into staying friends with me as it got worse. 

Well, it's been a year since we've cut off contact. I made it look like it was because of her lack of care and effort in our friendship and I had enough. But I've thought it over again and I realize that maybe I was the toxic one. Should I go back and apologize now (it's been bothering me and I feel very guilty) or just let it go?",23Jul2020,3

277,"My anxiety has gotten much much worse over the years. Always present at family/social gatherings. As I started hiding more and more of my personal life at home, and more of my home life to my friends it became much worse. The one place I have no social anxiety whatsoever apart from online is working front register at a fast food joint. At home I occasionally have anxiety attacks, maybe once a month. Every day is an excruciating and debilitating one riddled with anxiety due to my complete lack of privacy.  I used to think it was because I was constantly hiding something from my family, or that I wasn't comfortable at all expressing any shred of myself or my personality around them( I pause music, freeze up, and avoid eye contact near my entire family when they enter my room), but I also get anxiety near any welcome guests or visitors, even if they're 5 year old children having a play date.

280,"This is just a question that's been haunting me for a while.

I am underage, and can barely qualify as a teenager. I'm having issues with motivation, or feeling emotions overall. 

I have tried multiple times to get healthier habits, but they all end the same way: with me giving up on them because I forget about the outcome. 
Along with that, I'm having trouble feeling positive emotions. I've tried everything, from wholesome memes to telling my parents about my issue. Nothing ever changes.

I do have friends, and I even have a lover who's close to my own age. They don't do much either, but they're my motivation to find a solution, so they can have a more vibrant and caring version of me to hang out with in the future.. their happiness means a lot to me, and I want them to have a great friend, and I'm not sure current-day me is cutting the bill.

Will I eventually grow out of this, or is this a serious issue that I need to seek professional help with once the pandemic's over?

P.S., I know asking random internet people isn't gonna change anything, but it's worth a shot!",23Jul2020,1
281,"So I graduated from college a year ago. I noticed that whenever it was the summer and I would work at my internship my mental health would decline a lot due to a toxic work environment and an office lifestyle. Whenever I would return to school, any symptoms of anxiety would go away. However once I graduated I began working at the place I was interning and my mental health has predictively gone down. When I think of what I lost from not being in college, it was:
- a sense of community 
- a sense of purpose from involvement in student organizations
-my social life

If I was at a job that I was interested in, I think things would be better. However, I’m overall just thankful that I’m working now. I’m trying to find ways to find the things I’m missing from college but it seems the most mainstream source of a strong community after school is religious organizations. However I’m not really religious. So I’m wondering if any of y’all have been able to find a sense of community outside or religion/school and how you got into it",23Jul2020,1
282,"This is about health anxiety. I recently started a summer job at a truck repair shop. I work in the front office which is attached directly to shop. They often turn on the trucks in the back shop area and recently I started to worry about possible carbon monoxide entering the office area. While I'm there I'm totally panicked that there is carbon monoxide and that I'm doing permanent brain damage. I feel dizzy and get headaches but it might just be from the anxiety I'm feeling. The office area is small and the shop is medium size. They leave the garage doors open to let in air in the shop but the office area isnt really ventilated. The shop and office is separated by one door. I can barely sleep and eat and im onstantly checking if my head feels ok. I feel sick to my stomach and the carbon monoxide is all i can think about. My anxiety is telling me I'm destroying my brain for the rest of my life. Even if that seems silly, I cant control the feelings. I spend 9 hours a day there and the thought of doing 9 hours of damage a day terrifies me. I feel like I would never forgive myself if I let that damage happen and didnt do something about it. 

I have think I have 2 options currently. Option 1 is a gamble. I go and buy a carbon monoxide monitor and test the office. If I test the office and theresno carbon monoxide I will feel relief and a lot of this suffering will go away. On the other hand if it detects carbon monoxide I'm going to completely panicked and my anxiety will get even worse and I'll probably have to quit my job.

Option 2: I just continue on as is and try to cope with my current level of anxiety about it and try to deal with not knowing if theres carbon monoxide or not.

Is it better to know for sure with the meter or to live in ignorance and always have the hope that it fine?

Either way I'm leaving the summer job in September because I have to go to back to my college classes.",23Jul2020,1

284,"“Light of the seven”, I read aloud from a note on his desk. I looked down to see him foaming at the mouth. “Once upon a time I dreamed of fucking your brains out.” Now... I watch as he choked on his own saliva. 

Oleander, a flower with the light sweet smell of apricots. It lures you in with its scent, but becomes deadly when mistreated. I had heard of this plant, and what it could do. I did my research. Contrary to my impulsive habits, I truly thought about every aspect I did. Thought throughly on how, and why I did them.

“Jeff, Antonio, Nawfel, Renee, Glenn... Richard.” I muttered. Richard struck a nerve the most. I continued with my pie. 

2 cups flour
2 sticks of butter
1/4 cup ice cold water
2 cups peaches
1 cup homemade syrup ( made with water, sugar, and oleander leaves marinating in the mixture, then drained.) 

I turned the oven to 375, made the dough in a blender. Slowly waiting for the mixture to turn to dough. Separated the dough into 2 balls, rolled them both out, added the peaches, corn starch for thickness, and syrup mixture for sweetness. Who could resist peach pie? 50 mins it cooked while I waited for how I would deliver the pie. 

It was 5am when I started this process. I’m not much of an early person, but who would want a day old pie? Richard wasn’t one for sweets, but he’s eaten things I’ve given him before, or so he said. I could only hope he’d take this gesture as well. Plus, it wasn’t a processed, fast food item that he stood clear of. I knew this pie would be shared with others, but their lives did not matter to me, as long as he ate the pie. The end justifies the means, right? 

I made my way to his office. Not one bead of sweat, the calmest I’ve ever felt. It was a hot, and humid day. Light of the seven played on my phone through the car stereo. Such a justified song. So beautiful. The composer wrote what the characters felt through music. What I felt. Anger, hate, revenge. With all of that, I was at peace in that moment. 

6 hours later

I was in the back corridor of their offices. I walked back to his office. Richard’s office. I felt anger. I walked in, and saw him lying on the floor, phone in hand. He was fading away, foaming from the mouth, eyes rolling back. I knew he could still hear me. I took his thumb, and put it to his phone to unlock it. I scrolled to his Spotify, and found my playlist, “Hulk Reducer”. I knew he had a Spotify, because I had him download it, with my playlist. This was in case I needed grounding during a session, music helped with that. I found “Light of the Seven”, and heard sirens outside in the background. I look at him, and whispered, “your words will never hurt another person. It’s your turn to break.” Then pressed the song to play on repeat. “Adios, Richard”. 

Stay tuned to discover how I got the pie in without being noticed, how I knew when to return, and what happen afterwards. In addition, my many encounters with Richard leading up to this event.",23Jul2020,0

286,"I have been really, really holding off writing this on here as I know I'll get judged and be called a bad person. But it's gotten to the point where it's affecting me every day so I need to say something. I am in the best relationship I have ever been in my life. It's only been 3 months but it's with my best friend who I have known for four years. In an old relationship last year, it was quite toxic as we both got very jealous of other people we were talking to (ie he would get jealous of my guy friends and I would get jealous of his girl friends). I have never ever once cheated in my life and it is my biggest fear. In this old relationship, he did end up cheating on me and getting somebody pregnant and now he has a kid. In my new relationship I have no doubts that he would ever cheat on me because I know he is not like that but I feel so paranoid and clingy it's driving me insane. If he isn't online for a while or I have sent him a message and he doesn't reply for a long time I panic and worry and sometimes end up having a panic attack/pacing around the room/crying, etc. If he doesn't say ""I love you"" every now and then I think he's gone off me and doesn't love me anymore. If his mood seems even the slightest different, I feel like I've done something wrong. If he doesn't stand with me when we are in a group, I feel alone and like he doesn't want to be seen with me. Now I deep down know this is all ridiculous and irrational and even delusional. And another thing to note is that I never EVER act on these toxic feelings. I never accuse him of anything, I never get angry with him, I never beg him to give me attention. In fact, I would say I act completely normal in our relationship because I would rather suffer alone than risk of jepardise the best thing that has ever happened to me. So I'll mostly end up crying some nights and feeling hopeless and like I'm not worth anything. I almost feel like as soon as something goes right for me, my mental health loves to mess it up and make me feel this way. Sometimes I'll also have this horrible feeling that he's dead or that something terrible has happened even though I know it's irrational. I have also been having consistent nightmares about him cheating on me and I'll wake up shaking. I seem to have the internal thoughts of a possessive, jealous, clingy girlfriend but I never allow these feelings to show because I don't ever want to be that person. It wouldn't be fair on him because he has never done a single thing wrong. I always feel this way, no matter who it is with, but because this particular one is so special it hurts even more to feel this way about someone I love so much. It's gotten to the point where I can't sleep because I'm worrying so much and feeling alone when he's not with me or awake. I hate myself for feeling like this and I want it to stop but I don't know what to do.",23Jul2020,1
