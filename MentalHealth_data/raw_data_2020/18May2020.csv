1,i dont think im human i dont really know how to explain but ill try my best i feel like im some weird being like an alien or an angel but those with a lot of eyes but just trapped in this human flesh prison. i sound so silly but i just genuinely dont think im human and the only way to go back to my true form would be to die. i was just sent here as an experiment or maybe to help people but i know deep down i dont belong here even my parents told me ive been different and afraid of everything since i was a child and i really have and i can never communicate with anyone or even feel close to my closest friends and i look weird too. i always have this vision of my just transforming into this being with a lot of eyes and wings and i just dont feel like i belong in this body or on this earth,18May2020,1
2,"i’ve been struggling literally since i was a child. i had obsessions/compulsions but i didn’t know that’s what it was. the fact that OCD is portrayed as a cleaning or tidiness thing (it can be but not always) made me never look into it. i’ve been diagnosed with generalized anxiety and clinical depression. i beat an eating disorder that really almost killed me. i take medicine for my anxiety. but i’ve recently realized that a lot of my behavior and thought patterns fall into the OCD category. most of my thoughts and compulsions are about religious things and i have found great comfort in r/scrupulosity because i feel seen and heard for the first time since i was about 8. i’m a 21 year old female, college student, and have had the same amazing boyfriend for five years. i have a wonderful home life, good friends and family, i’ve never gone without anything i genuinely needed. i feel so much guilt for the way i’ve felt most of my life because on paper i should be extremely happy. 

my boyfriend just told me he doesn’t know that he can marry me (i thought for sure we were getting engaged this year because he just got an incredible job and i am graduating college next year) because of my mental health struggles. he thinks it’s emotionally exhausting and he can’t imagine doing this his whole life. i’ve struggled throughout our entire relationship, he was the first person i told when i broke down and started counseling almost six years ago, he was there for me in the emergency room for 14 hours when i had a panic attack and thought i was dying, he’s held me while i cried about wanting to be normal, he had to force me to eat when i almost wasted away, but he has never complained. in fact he told me just last year that all these problems are minuscule compared to all the other great qualities i have. last summer all we talked about was marriage and grad school and future plans. i don’t know how to cope with the potential loss of the person who means the most to me in the entire world. 

how do i stop burdening him? what can i do to get better faster? i haven’t been very proactive or stayed ahead of my issues since being in college makes it hard to get home to my preferred counselor, but i have sought out help. he just thinks it isn’t enough. 

i have hope that someday i will get better but he says that since this isn’t a phase and something that will be present my whole life it’s hard to
imagine being married to me.

that absolutely broke me. it all feels very unfair. i feel like i have been through so much in my 21 years, carried so much pain through childhood, teenage years, and now as i’m emerging into adulthood, and this is just one more thing that is going to knock me down. why do i have to struggle? i don’t understand and it just sucks and i needed to tell someone and i guess reddit was the place. i can’t sleep. i can’t stop crying. he’s fine. he’s probably not going to miss me or care. he says he loves me but i just don’t know. i love him so much and have since i was 16. we have been through so much and i know it has to be hard being my boyfriend, i know it must be difficult watching me struggle and being there for me but i have always been there for him too. i try to be supportive and helpful and kind and loving and do many things for him to be encouraging or to show my love. 

what else can i do?",18May2020,1

5,"(TW: suicide) 

I have a long history of mental issues and nearly ended my life earlier this year...now I can’t see people talk about that topic without getting immediately tensed up or triggering anxiety attacks. I like to write music and I can’t even use any sort of mental health topics in that without getting screwed up for hours. When I last talked to my therapist I had an extremely hard time talking about when I was suicidal, I ended up lying to him. I also hate hearing people talk about health issues because I used to have horrible hypochondria and that can set me off too.",18May2020,1
6,"I was just talking with my boyfriend when I was saying I have no interests or hobbies or aspirations so I will never get into a uni and life beyond a levels is gonna be crap coz I have no idea how I will find a career idk. And he said it annoyed him how I had such a negative outlook on it and I will find something and I will just need to work hard and I will get somewhere. I muted myself and started crying I don’t know why I just did. I started smacking myself in the head and saying shit to myself about how I was boring my life will suck, he will leave me, there’s nothing for me. These then proceeded into me screaming into my hands that I need to harm myself and then that my life will be so shit that maybe I should just hand my self than listing all the things I could use in my room. I’ve calmed down now from all the crying and screaming. All my boyfriend heard for 16 mins was silence. But.

8,"Growing up i was kind of daddys little girl, however i was also super scared of him when he got mad and to this day am. If he got mad he’d hit me or hit me with hangers or make me kneel on the wood floor for an extended amount of time however i still dont find any of that weird i think its just normal. Fast forward to 8th grade my parents found out i kissed a guy and i was definately hit and he asked me if i was a prostitute and he said he couldnt even look at me. That was a big deal i was taken out of school for a while i overdosed and was in this mental facility place for a few days. A little after all that my parents found out i was cutting and my mom was crying and asked “you dont think we love you?” And my dad immediately asked my mom “why are you using the word love?” And turned to me and said “we really like you” tht whole convo has stuck with me to this day, i mean as a family we dont really use the word love however my mom does tell me she loves me once in a while and it still takes me by surprise every time bc honestly its weird but i still appreciate it. Anyways now im 21 and im just questioning my life style choices and behavior and wondering why i do what i do, maybe im just stupid i dont really know. It could also be that my parents were incredibly strict growing up and i have just always lived in fear of my father to this day really. But now in college with my freedom i seem to engage in risky sex pretty often and like i dont even need the emotional factor at all and its not like i orgasm ever from casual sex i just DO IT for whatever reason, like if i think a guy is attractive im probably gonna sleep with him the next day. I just love sex i dont really know why, maybe i just like being close and naked with someone and pleasing someone? I dont catch feelings very often but when i do i am all in and would do anything for the person. I have a bad habit of being a people pleaser and do tend to let ppl walk all over me sometimes. I love all the male attention i get and literally go out of my way to to go crazy at the gym and take care of myself for myself mostly but also because i like the attention i get. Im way too into my looks i admit but im also smart i go to a great university and major in computer sci (my dads wish but i dont mind). Since ive been in college i racked up a body count of 20 and i have also contracted herpes and ive always dealt with depression but dealing with the news of herpes was horrible but i have come to terms with it. But if my dad is ever upset i take it personal and automatically assume it has to do with me and get all suicidal and i hate it like its so crazy to get suicidal just bc someone is mad at you but now tht im at home bc of all this coronavirus im not allowed to do anything or go anywhere and i just dread living everyday in fear of my dad. I wake up and just sit around with my laptop on my lap to make myself look like im studying so i dont get in trouble, school is over! But i prob should be studying anyways lol idrk what my question is i just find myself constantly rebelling or am i just a normal college kid? Does it sound like i have daddy issues or just issues in general or am i just stupid and immature? I have decided whenever i do go back to school i am not gonna engage in anymore meaningless sex and just focus on school but im scared i wont be able to.",18May2020,1
9,"This is a technique that I've developed over the years, and it has works surprisingly well. I don't think anyone's immune to painful memories from their past. Those who might deny it may not remember a time in their life where they've dealt with it, but we all make mistakes and have these moments at some point in our lives. Personally, there's been periods of my life where I would have these moments many times a day. I was at a very dark place for many years.

My process for coming up with the technique was that at one point I was curious about Eastern breathing techniques and started experimenting on my own. I found it affective without the yawn for a while, but I noticed that it was noticeable to people around me. Through some trial and error, I settled on yawning, and it has been foolproof so far.

I have as much reason to have painful memories as anyone — perhaps more than most. I really hope this small thing helps someone as much as it helped me. And I don't post super often here or anywhere, so any direction on whether this fits the spirit of this sub would be really helpful.",18May2020,1

On the flipside, I am always in control of my emotions, perhaps too much control sometimes to the point where you cannot tell the way I feel.

I was always a very miserable and somewhat sad. Whenever I was offered something or given an oppertunity (I still do this) I would always try to deliberately sabatage my own happiness.

Does anyone have any idea why this is? Why I get the unwarranted urge to be miserable and stop myself from enjoying things?

18," It's been 15 years and I still don't understand depression.

Sorry for the length, I have trouble expressing myself clearly. I still feel like a loser, I'm still ultra sensitive to my and other's emotions, I still lack energy, I still rely on others to temporarily help me through doubt, and I still don't believe in myself.

I've had psychologists and psychiatrists (the latter being useless for me, including medication which never affected me positively). I'm seeing a better psychologist now, though it's just moments that sort of help.

I've gone from: 10 years ago (almost 20 years old then) where I did nothing but play 1 video game and was not studying or working (depression &amp; anxiety out of control), to 5 years ago where all I did was play that 1 game as well as play music in a beginner band (quit a few years later from lack of enjoyment and general stress/anxiety), to 1 year ago where I had finished an advanced diploma in a commerce subject. Right now I'm finishing a commerce degree and managed (through family) to get 2 casual jobs (I work about 10 hours a week).

I can see the progression considering I never thought I could ever get a job with my mental state, but I genuinely don't ""feel"" any progression. I still feel the same. I think part of it is being almost 30 and I still live at home, hardly work, no savings, barely have friends, don't get along with my family that well (we kind of all have emotional problems and 1 of my parents can be quite demoralizing and/or nasty, whether it's about my mental state or they are just in a bad mood..that severely gets to me, even little comments..that makes me feel bad being almost 30 and still get upset by comments from your parent, especially ones that I'm told not to take personally). On top of that I have significant anxiety in regards to socializing and driving my car. Part of that relates to being ultra sensitive and having no self-belief. I also don't seem to be able to develop much interests (or if I do its only minor) which stops me having conversations with people. In general I feel no purpose for my life. Working is fine sure, but not when you don't see a point in anything in life and don't enjoy much.

So I don't know what to do. I don't understand how I feel the same.. Or maybe it's just not that big a deal what I've done in the big picture (considering my age and the fact I have not managed to develop friends or interests). I keep genuinely trying but I feel no progress and still get beat down into misery over so many things. Makes me think I'm one of the people that actually should get rid of of themselves given my weaknesses.

Last thing to say is I try mindfulness, have read a couple self help books, still see therapist... it's like fighting a bushfire with a little garden hose. How can I be so bad at this?

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**: hard to do, but - it's been 15 years, I've made ""some"" career-wise progression but nothing huge (I think), still struggle with being ultra sensitive, have a therapist and had many in the past. Almost no friends, no savings, live at home with parents who can be nasty (can't move out yet). I don't know how it can be this long and still feel the same in regards to self-belief, being sensitive, etc. ",18May2020,1

20,"Redditors, I know this must all sound awfull, trust me I feel like a terrible person and I'm writing this with tears, but I could really use some advice. 

I'm a 21f and I have been lying to people ever since I was a child.
It started because I had a very abusive childhood, and I would make up happier stories to people around me as to not have to face my reality.

Eventually I stopped doing that and started being honest to people, but I guess the sympathy that that got made me feel a bit better somehow. And the lying continued. I started telling tall tales, little lies for no reason (could even be something like what I had for breakfast) and got deeper and deeper.

Over the years I've dealt with alot of the hurt from my childhood, and have dropped alot of the lies I told, I moved country a few times and managed to ""start over"" but for some reason I kept doing it, I keep doing it.
I want to stop, I really do. It makes no sense, there Is no point to it at all. But it just shoots out of my mouth (I have adhd and often find it hard to think before I speak in general) . Its not even a conscious thought, it's never been a ""I'm going to deceive this person now"", but it just comes out. I've been embarrassed to go to a therapist. 

In half a year I'm moving country again (alone) to the other side of the world. I do NOT want to tell any lies to anyone I meet, it can be a fresh start and I want it to be. But this has become such a subconscious habbit, I don't know how to stop.

21,"I’m a 23 year old female and my family and I have all suffered from the emotional and sexual abuse of my grandmother. She’s never touched us sexually but she’s always called me a whore or other derogatory terms. I remember the first day she called me a whore was when I was 5 and she found out I had a crush on my classmate. Growing up she often made inappropriate sexual statements to me like accusing me of “inviting men to have sex with me” by the way I looked at them or having sex with boys behind dumpsters... I never did these things but I did start having sex at an early age, when I was 15. 

I feel like this upbringing had a significant impact on my adult life and it has definitely had a great impact on my mom and aunts a lot more than us (their kids). My aunt has gotten to a point where she NEVER leaves the house because she’s afraid of crowds. My mom is a pushover, doesn’t bathe, and wears diapers kind of for no reason...

This is fucking ridiculous and goes to the point where I become visibly angry at Dwight in the office, even though it's a damn comedy series. I cried several times during Inside Out, got light headed being happy for italian folks in that movie with a small village in the mountains. Same goes for even remembering the scenes from films, as if I relive the same moments again. I also sometimes become light headed after telling a successful joke or argument to a group.

At the same time I'm completely desensitized and can watch bunnies being tied to dynamite or actual footage of people dying, with no passing thought. It's even interesting sometimes. I do feel bad for them, but at a different level, where I'm taking mental notes about what can be done to make sure the situation never happens again.

It’s like theirs somebody watching and judging me all the time and it’s not good.

I’ve been depressed for a year or two and thought about suicide more times then I’d prefer to say, but I just feel like nothing that made me happy is there anymore. 

Today has been one of the worse cause I told my aunt who was visiting about how I don’t like dirt biking with my dad (me and my dad dirt bike a lot but I get scared since I’ve hurt myself badly while doing it) since I got hurt and I told her about my mental issues with breakdowns. Sadly I couldn’t bring myself to tell her how I’m depressed and have thought about suicide.

I just feel like I’m doing it for attention, I know my mental health is serious but I can’t help myself from thinking some part of me wants attention from it. Like if I commit suicide it would just be to get people to think about me, luckily I’m to much of a coward to go through with anything and I can’t bring myself to cut but I feel like I can’t tell anybody cause it brings attention to myself.

Again with being stuck at home and acting like somebody who’s not me is killing me, I want to come out to my aunt now that I know she’s good with my mental stuff and is there for me but again another part of me thinks I’m doing it for attention.

I don’t know what to do cause I don’t want to burden my friends anymore even though they would jump off a roof to help me.

It turns out I have real black out rage when I get into stuff, no violence, just shouting and stuff. 

But I've also noticed when thinking about the last couple of years that I am having periods of massive lethargy, even for the things I love, then periods of mass amounts of energy, I even sometimes avoid my good friends and family, just because I feel so ""anti-social""


The issue is, I've always seen myself as the shrug it off, move forward kind of guy. But now I'm seeing more and more problems that need addressing, and I don't know where to start, who to talk to, or if I'm even capable of doing so?

Tbh, I just wanted to open up for the first time, see if anyone has these symptoms, or if anyone can direct me as to where and how to get help. 

Thanks.",18May2020,1

36,"I'm really just not sure tbh.

I'm sure _something_ is wrong. I know it.

I feel like the one thing that I used to love doing, coding up cool stuff, is something I can't bring myself to start now. I don't wash or clean my clothes, my apartment is in a state and I'm only cleaning it because I have an inspection. I have impending deadlines and I feel either apathetic, or panicked over them. And my sleep schedule is weird. I feel like I flash between alert and falling asleep. My diet is shit, I can't cook and I don't want to mess up so I don't try. I haven't cut my hair in a year since I find it hard to even speak to a new hairdresser in case things go wrong and I end up looking like an idiot.

I have weirdly down moments, but I can always seem to put on a friendly tone and even joke around on a discord call. I don't feel bad all the time, but it hits regularly. I don't try to speak to people. I've been in quarantine for a month or so, but I don't speak to people. I have no friends here, and my family live at home. Only a few things make me genuinely happy, and I often struggle to show a happy reaction. I don't find my hobbies fun anymore and I'd rather just stay in and do meaningless stuff.

I've had mental breakdowns, and I feel like I have a long laundry list of circumstances that would fuck me up. I was prescribed anti-depressants last year but didn't take them, I guess I just didn't like the idea of pills and having a cloudy mind or something. Or I thought that the only way is to find my own way to deal with it all. I regularly repress these dark rants around people and it feels natural to do so.

Even now. I don't know if I'm that bad off. Others have it worse, way worse. I'm not exactly writing this very emotively right now. It's more like a rambling I've come up with in a perfectly emotionless state. Like a question.

Something is wrong, but I don't know if I've found the right word. I can't even prove it really exists to others. Not without such a word. But I don't know if my case is typical enough to ever get a label.",18May2020,1

I’m so proud of them and so happy they are doing amazing things. But it’s like, how are they able to complete 4 year degrees and I’m still working on a two year, for 5 years now. I know we all have different paces in life and I know I should be kind to myself and understand that the circumstances in my life are much different than theirs.

39," Hi reddit.

So growing up, I was abandoned by both parents one after the other and passed along through relatives who never really liked me. I spent most of my time alone when not in classes and being the loner has always made me a easy bullying target. Ever since high school I've kept my guard up with other people, especially the ones that act nice around me, because I believe they have a ulterior motive/hidden agenda for it. I can't remember the last time I got a a hug or even a complement. I've also been in therapy for over 5 consecutive years and right now I just spew everything out and the therapist listens without more than 2 or 3 sentences per session, so I think I've given it enough time to work it out and just isn't.

I don't want to be alone anymore. It is crushing me inside that I'm this old without ever having friends and any dating experience whatsoever.

* What is a good starting point?
* How do I stop being scared of other people?
* How do I get close to someone without showing them the complete trainwreck I am inside and not cause them to reject me, refueling my deepest fears?

I've been trying hard the past few years to put myself out there but I have the strongest impression that the world is going so fast that people just want to move on to the next wave asap or are very impatient to deal with any of it.

44,"I tried looking up articles about this but it wasn’t really helpful. My mother is undiagnosed, would never get help or admit fault to a therapist, but my therapist believes she might have BPD and after research I think that’s correct. I just recently became an adult and now it’s a very different dynamic, as she becomes more and more aggressive. She guilt trips me constantly saying she’s afraid now that I’m an adult I won’t see her anymore, while also becoming super angry any time I do something on my own volition. Her arguing skills are highly impressive, (and always have been according to my father, her ex-husband,) and I have a really hard time getting untangled from the world she creates, still wanting to help her understand my side, still wanting her validation. I’ve tried arguing techniques meant for de-escalation but she recognizes them and becomes more aggressive when I use them. For example, if I say “I understand that’s how you see it, but it makes me feel...” she will say “No, that’s not how I see it, that’s how it is. You just hate me, and don’t want to listen to me.” In typical BPD fashion she’s always the victim. If I try to just straight up end/exit the argument it becomes a tirade of insults, I’m a coward or I’m ignorant or I’m a bad child. Each time I know I should turn the other cheek and continue to leave but it always turns me around to defend myself. One of my best friends says I should leave and never come back, and honestly I’d agree except for my three little half-sisters (who she also has been using to guilt trip me) who I love and want to see. Is there any way to control this and stop her from playing me like a fiddle? How do I set up strong boundaries? I think she may be too far gone for therapy or help, I think the only path now is defense.",18May2020,1
45,"hi, i don't really know how to explain this so I'm going to take an example which happened recently.

i saw a comment on Youtube which i really disagreed with and decided to reply. when i got replies back and read them, my heart started beating super fast and i felt overwhelmed. it wasn't because i felt hurt by the comments but because i started thinking about all the ways which i disagreed with them and wanted to reply and construct a well-written message.

i notice this happens in other contexts like during a class or reading things online (discord, etc) which stimulate the part of my mind which wants to argue/debate. i don't really understand why i can't be calm as i read them/reply to them, it feels maladaptive as it makes me want to engage in ""controversial"" conversations less and it also feels harder to think critically as i'm feeling so intensely. a very similar feeling happens when someone makes me angry or insults me. i don't know if these different stimuli are connected to the same ""thing"" that creates the physical reaction. 

it reminds me of the feeling of social anxiety but i'm not sure it exactly fits as i'm alone in my room as it happens, so it's not like anyone can perceive me as being anxious or i become embarrassed. 

can anyone relate to this feeling? 

also, is there anything i can do to try and lessen the intensity of the experience?

thank you.",18May2020,1
46,"We are almost 100% settled in now. All we need are bed frames for all the beds, a few dressers for our clothes, and a few other odds &amp; ends. Otherwise, we have everything put where we want it and we are having our X-Finity service installed tomorrow so I will have proper Internet.

I have fallen in love with the neighborhood (we lived in this general area from 2004-2014, just down a bit further, closer to downtown where we are on the upper end now, closer to the next small borough over) and I love the apartment. This feels like home to me now a little more than before.

I truly feel ok here.

My comfort didn't stop the strong urges I get though. One hit as we were going to get something from the store when I noticed there are Dumpsters everywhere. There are many businesses around, and the Dumpsters are empty (shit down) but still there. It wasn't funny...it really hurt me in ways I can't even describe-mentally, emotionally, and even physically as I had to hold myself back from jumping out of the car and lighting one up, and I don't think hubby understood how serious I was because I was trying to crack jokes the whole time too.

47,"There’s this guy I’ve been talking to for awhile and we aren’t dating but we might as well be. I’m transgender and he knows that but still seems really interested in me. I really want to ask him to be my boyfriend but first I’m very insecure about my body and think I should get that sorted out first. I wouldn’t just classify the insecurities I have with my body dysphoria. I know I’m a woman, the things I feel bad about don’t necessarily make me feel like I’m a man but they make me feel masculine therefore less womanly. Not like I’m not a woman but I’m... bad at being one. Especially because I only feel this way because they’re things cis women have said to/about me assuming that I’m also a cis woman. I’ve been made fun of for my height and my broad shoulders and the size of my feet. The thing is, I like being tall, I wouldn’t have such nice proportions if it wasn’t for my height. I also like my shoulders too, I used to spread body lava on them to make them glittery before people started making comments on how masculine they make me look. I’ve since not only thrown out my body lava but also any of my clothes that aren’t long sleeved and all of my shoes with even the slightest of heels. I mean, I didn’t wear high heels to begin with but I got rid of my Doc Martens and bought some thin-sole converse online to replace my regular converse. Now, this guy I like, I know he’s attracted to me. He’s always saying how pretty I look and we’ve made out a few times, but I worry that he’ll be ashamed to be seen with me since everyone seems to find me so grotesque, especially cause he’s a few inches shorter than I am and I don’t want him to feel embarrassed. 

I know I shouldn’t let this get to me especially cause I already like my body (with the exception of what’s downstairs) but I just feel so uncomfortable in public because I feel like everybody is judging my body in my head and I want to pursue the guy I’m seeing but I’m scared he won’t be happy with people knowing we’re together. It’s stupid too because he’s said nothing to indicate anything like that, I just feel so damn traumatized because of the way people talk about me. I don’t know what to do to feel okay.

But on a more serious note, I've been dealing with this problem. It's not too serious, but sometimes I think it is and I'm not even sure it's worthy of putting on this subreddit or if anyone will respond.

To put it simply; I've been in a slightly dark place recently, and I've come to a realization. I only feel loved in an emotionally abusive relationship. I want to be in one with someone I know, although I haven't made any moves yet. I know it will damage me, as I'm a particularly sensitive person but that's why I want it?? Okay let me just explain when I found out:

I have a friend who has been pretty rough on themselves, but rough as well on others. Recently they've been very dysphoric in coming out with their gender, and it turns out they were transgender. During this time he got into a bunch of fights with my other friend... and for some reason I got jealous. I wanted to be the one being cursed at, I wanted to be the one called names.

The other friend has been suffering from depression, and writes very self depricating poems. They are beautifully  crafted, and in my opinion masterpieces. However- I notice that when these two hate themselves I get jealous. I've thought that I was just being a toxic person, not wanting for them to be sad and have the spotlight on me all the time- but that didn't feel right. (I mean maybe I'm toxic but I still don't know.. ;-;) 

I've just now realized what I want. It took some time, but I had started writing in my journals and during that time I've come to a realization.

If I was the one they screamed at, I'd feel loved. If I was the one they'd hit, I'd feel loved. Just anything that they would to to purpousefully inflict pain on me, I'd love. I've grown closer to them every single time they've hurt me and I don't know why. Sometimes I've found myself crying over them, but it wasn't the bad crying. I was sad, but also happy?? Happy that I was sad???

It's becoming a trend now. I've spent many nights crying, and I've even once thought doing a bit of self-harm again, but that wouldn't satisfy me. I need for THEM to cut me. I keep letting myself get hurt over and over- but I won't be happy without it. They make me feel like I belong. What do I do?? HELP?!?!",18May2020,1
51,"I want to start by saying that if there’s been posts covering this- please let me know, but i searched around and couldn’t find much on it. 

I take 5 pills a day. 4 in the morning and one in the afternoon. I always remember i have to take them but i rarely ever get myself to take ALL of them. I will always take my birth control because i know that not taking it could result in a kid and that’s a horrifying concept for me. I’m pretty good about taking my adderall because i know that i will feel it within a few minutes and i need to take it to get work done during the day. 

The problem is getting myself to take my Wellbutrin and lamictal. My aversion has a couple facets to it; a year and a half ago i attempted suicide by overdose so taking more then 2 pills at a time gives me a tad bit of ptsd. lamictal has no coating, tastes terrible, and makes me gag when i force myself to swallow it. The Wellbutrin has a coating so it doesn’t taste bad it’s just ugh another pill. I don’t feel immediate “same day” effects by not taking either of these. The effects pop up after a few days of not taking them. 

How can i get myself to consistently take all of my pills? I have a days of the week pill container so they’re all there together i just wake up and go meh i don’t feel like taking all of them.

54,"I’m a female, 17- I have a minimum wage job that pays be 175 a week. 

My grades have gone to shit recently, and seeing that makes me anxious- but not for myself. I’m anxious how my mom will react... you see, I have been placed on a podium for years, getting praised at maintaining a 4.0 GPS and as I’ve gotten older, my anxiety disorder has worsened and I do believe it’s developed into more symptoms- into something else. I haven’t diagnosed any of this for the fact that my mom doesn’t believe in it. I have had this since I was 4- the most recent I can remember. I was 6 when I realized no one else feels like me normally, always feeling scared and dreading it. Like I’m always watching a scary movie at the part of the build up and never seeing the climax. 

My point here- without this rambling continuing- is I’ve had suicidal thoughts concerning school, and my thoughts towards it for years, and barely recognized it during the pandemic. And with quarantine making my 4.0 go to a 1.5 from me having no motivation anymore, I feel that dread go away for a moment, before thinking about my mom again. 

I want to have that conversation that they aren’t going to go back up, it isn’t possible with the little days we have left in school, but that I’m finally feeling improvement in my mental health. And how to even talk to her about supporting me financially with getting a therapist- to have someone who can help me in the future, address the suicidal thoughts and manage the manic episodes I see being more prevalent and common.

How do I even get her to believe I need help when I lie everyday to her face, playing this comical facade that I’m happy and bubbly. It’s draining, and I’m scared how to talk to them without making it seem like it’s a “teenager” thing, and I’m not some sort of shameful, selfish girl who doesn’t want to work hard anymore on school.

He started to loosen up and Friday felt better. He had a bad hangover Saturday and I let/made him recover and sleep and feel better. I tried to get him to engage in sexual activities with me and after some convincing he finally did and then we went to bed. Well he didn’t sleep last night. He said his insomnia was bad. He was in a bad mood again and started working himself to the bone on some home projects we were working on. He really kind of ignored me all day.
My best friend recently found some new friends and has been spending time with them. I think it’s healthy to have other friends but since he found new friends he really has casted me aside and hardly spends time with me now. 
I don’t feel like I fit in my world right now. My depression has spiked from this and I just want to pack up my stuff and leave this life and find something else.

68,"Honestly. From day one my life has been a mess.
I was born to a single mom because my father was to scared to raise a child and ran. But that didn't stop him from coming back 5 years later to just knock up my mother again and leave. 

After my father was gone for good my mom married my step dad. This man became my worst night mare. Im not sure why he was so terrible to me and my brother, but he took everything out on us. It was rare that he physically abused us, but he would always say the most terrible things that just made a person feel completely degraded. He and my mother had 3 more children and me and my brother were essentially left to our own devices. We were shunned by our ""family"" and forced to stay in our rooms besides to eat and go to school. 

In my early teen years I attempted my first suicide attempt. Just the basic of cutting my wrists. But I ofcourse failed which lead to me being hospitalized for a week. My step ""dad"" made sure I felt like the biggest piece of shit on the planet for it. 

Due to this I became mad at the world. I hated life, and I hated everyone in it. I joined the wrong crowd at school started doing / thinking awful things that I regret to this day.

After my first attempt It was decided that I needed to move in with my grandparents. Now there is no words that can describe how much I love them. They have treated me like their own since the time I moved in. I really love them like they are my mom and dad. The next year with them was the best year of my life. 

After the year was over it was time for me to move back in with my parents. And the abuse began immediately again. My anger in the world just got worse. I deeply grew to resent human kind as a whole. After about 6 months of living with my parents again I could no longer take their beatings so I left for my fathers. 

I was with my father for a better part of a year and then joined the Army. I did good, completed basic training, and then got fucked over. Ofcourse problems with my job that I won't go into detail with stopped me from moving onto AIT and I was trapped in Benning for an addition 8 months. That was hell. 

After I finally left Benning for AIT thats when things got bad again. The army had me grow into a better person, I was able to ditch the horrible thoughts I had about humanity, and understand that the thought process i had was wrong. But it lead to my understanding that I was trans, and had been suppressing these feelings with hatred and fear due to my parents. 

This lead to 3 more suicide attempts all within about 6 weeks. After the 3rd attempt I was honorably released from the service. 

Now I live back at home with my grandparents. And every day I feel like a failure. I couldn't make it doing my dream in the military. I can't be who I am because of the looming shadow of my step father and overall anti-lgbtq feelings in my family. And I just want to die.

Am I really suppose to die at 20. I feel so young. But life feels like it doesn't have much time left. I dread waking up. I hate doing anything. I can barely eat. I can't stand looking at myself in the mirror. I get no enjoyment out of anything. And if anything could save my life it would be just genuine love from one person.",18May2020,1
69,"My last friend left me, about a month and a half ago but I finally realized today that he left me for good and it’s now finally starting to hit me hard. All I’ve done for the past month and a half is think, I daydream to cope, I imagine things. I always feel like I’m here for something more, I feel like I’m some supernatural god destined to save the world or some storybook bullshit, I guess I use that as a way of coping with the reality that there is nothing for me. I’m always sitting there looking for that “moment” that I’ll show everyone who I truly an but the truth is that I am nothing and pretty soon the only thing I’ll be is just a statistic. 

My parents also found out about my self harming a month ago and I’ve stopped since then but now its so hard to be near my parents, I can tell all they think about around me is the fact that I self harm, they hate me for it. It gives me constant anxiety and it makes me even more stressed. I guess this is more of a vent so many people probably won’t read all this. 

I wish I could converse, every conversation I’ve been completely detached from lately, I have to forcibly get myself to respond to my parents. My social anxiety has gotten worse and worse and it’s gotten so bad I’m scared to talk to people even online. I just can’t talk anymore.

Witnessed my girlfriend having a PTSD episode for the first time

Using a throwaway account for privacy reasons.

So I've been dating this girl for about two months, and I love everything about her. As cliche' as this sounds, she's been the greatest thing to ever happen in my life and I wouldn't trade her for anything. We're college aged lovebirds enjoying every moment together.

I've been staying at her place for about a week and tonight was the first time I've witnessed her PTSD episode come to fruition. Now, I already know about her condition and that she's had flashbacks and episodes before. This all stemmed from growing up with a mother who had multiple personality disorder to where during her mother's bad days she was abused heavily to the point of trauma. As of recent, my GF's episodes have been far less frequent and a lot better, and I personally have never seen it happen. 

Until tonight.

Earlier in the day, she mentioned about having hallucinations and seeing the wall turn from white to purple wavy colors. She mentioned it was really nothing and not bad at all. I put it in the back of my mind and paid no further heed, as the rest of the day was very much a happy one, albeit I did notice her seemingly tired a bit more. 

Tonight, we were laying in bed and after some merrymaking we were chilling and resting in silence. However, soon I started noticing tears form. She claimed it was nothing, but I knew better. I hugged her and held her close, then she started balling in my shoulder. As I have no experience, I did what I best thought I could do: I kept telling her everything is alright, I'm here, and I'll protect and be with her always no matter what, hugging her as tight as I could.

She continued for about thirty minutes in my arms, then seemed to have calmed down. She was less audible but she said she felt better. I turned on all the lights and currently have some of her favorite songs playing and get her comfortable enough to get some good sleep. 

I haven't had a deep conversation concerning the specifics of how her episodes manifest, what they're like, and how best to deal with them due to not wanting to instigate a possible episode. I've entered in this relationship knowing full well about her condition and I still love her anyways and want to be there even more and help her the best way possible. She's been seeing a therapist near our college since last year, until COVID-19 happened and we moved back to our respective homes from college. She said she dissociated a lot in the past and she's had a mental breakdown episode that lasted for two weeks last year that prompted her to start therapy. 

Anyhow, as someone who can say they don't have much experience with PTSD, how can I best help her as her boyfriend? As of now, I cannot physically be with her 24/7, so I'd love to know tips for long distance help as well. Just anything in general to help her through this condition and help her be as happy and feel as safe as possible.",18May2020,1

He has been talking about killing himself and how he is upset our daughters  life has been ruined by him.

89,"I, (14M), have been fighting with depression for at least 2 years now. It sounds weird that a teenager would have depression, but that stance is understandable without knowing the backstory.

Since kindergarten I have had a very good friend. Our moms were friends, so naturally, we began spending a lot of time together. We went to the park, each others houses and outside in general.

When we started going to school, I learned he had type 2 diabetes, so when one day he dissapeared from class for 1 year straight, I didint think much of it. I didint know what had happened.

A year later, he was allowed to go back home, so we decided to go to his house. Because of the amount of time that had passed, I saw him as a new person. Funny, caring amd happy. That was the last day I saw him.

A week or so passed. A normal school day had passed and I was back home. My dad came home at 6PM and I went to greet him. When he opened the door, I saw him crying for the first time in my life. I started asking what had happened and started crying aswell. 

He then told me, that my best friend had drowned it the ocean. They were out on holiday at the beach. He went into the watter and didint come out. When his mom started searching for him, she couldnt find him.  What followed was a 2 day search opperation, where they looked for him with helicopters and boats. After the 2 days had passed, they found his dead body washed up on the beach.

I cried. I cried a lot. I never really recovered from that. Of course, at the time I was younger and people didint think anything of a mental illness. I didint have anyone to talk to. If I told my classmates I had depression, they said I was lying and made fun of me. A teenager cant have depression, right?

Maybe 2 years later, a psychologist came to work in the school. I begged my mom to let me go there. She did, and I started going. It was only once a week though, so I cant really talk about everything that frequently. 

At that point I had developed strong/intense depression, and that led to self harm. I now started wearing long sleeve shirts and jackets to hide my cut marks. I had also told the psychologist that I had suicidal thoughts, because, well, I did. She figured out about my self harm. She told my parents, who were concerned. They tried cheering me up, always being there for me and handled me like a fragile vase, unlike before - as a child, whose only feelings were happy or sad. That didint work on me, but just seeing them panic and try so hard to make me happy, that alone made me stop.

92,im in a extremely rough state right not and dont see any option other than suicide,18May2020,1
93,"
I've gone through some pretty hellish things myself. I've attempted (or at least gotten close) to suicide many times. It's incredibly draining to live with mental illness. There's a lot of guilt associated with feelings and thoughts of suicide and depression. It's a constant battle against your own brain waking up every day. I totally understand. 

Even if you consider your circumstances ""not that bad"" and feel guilty about your bad feelings. Even if you know there are people going through worse.. your experiences are just as valid!! No problem is too small to be listened to. 

No problem is too big to deal with, either. You are not a burden for having intense thoughts on your mind. You aren't ""too much to deal with."" If you fear opening up because you think that it's going to push others away- well, forget that thought entirely! I'm one of the many willing to listen. You are not too much. You are worthy.

If you have lashed out on others, pushed people away, or isolated because of depression/thoughts... know that I understand that, too. 

It can be harder to accept people into your space if you are surrounded by toxic people yourself, don't have learned coping skills, or have guilt making you feel like pushing others away is the only option. 

If you have been rejected by family, have your feelings/illness ignored, are afraid to open up, or don't have the resources readily available.. I understand how hurt that can make a person feel. I know some people's approaches to mental health are not always the most helpful- and that not everything works for the same person. 

There are so many suicidal people. From so many backgrounds. From so many circumstances. All with varying levels of support/reactions around them- as well as internal coping for themselves. 

Even if you DO get up every day, struggling with mental illness. It can be draining. It can feel hopeless. Even with help, sometimes it can be hard. And for you, too, I offer love and support. Your struggle is not unnoticed. If you struggle to function and focus every day, and still pull through. I am proud. 

And if you relapse, break down, or feel unloved above all else.. Know that your feelings are valid, and I am here for you, too. And despite the ache.. I am proud of *you*  too. 

Some of us live in complicated situations. Some of us have done things we're not proud of. Some of us have gone through immense trauma. And some of us are just.. Tired of life. 

But everyone deserves to break through barriers. Celebrate small things. Be in touch with your feelings. See your aspirations and reach for them with all your strength. Even if you have none. Even if your identity and sense of purpose are out of whack. Hell.. You deserve to be here anyway. Even if you see nothing to live for. Even if you're in an environment that makes it hard to heal. You are so fucking stellar and I am PROUD of you. 

To give up.. and being afraid.. to break down and scramble for reasons to stay here..is all just- part of the battle. And you have absolutely nothing to be fucking ashamed of. 

Whether someone has hurt you, or you have hurt someone. Whether you struggle with a terminal illness or you're having a hard day. Or week, or month, or life. I'm telling you, your feelings are valid. I getchu. Anyone can be depressed. But what matters to me is that you are heard, or at least find some solace in the fact that you are worthy of a good life.

Even if it takes a while to get there, and even if it still is a struggle now and then once things get better. Self improvement is always possible, and I swear to god, I'll respond to anyone who messages me.

(I'm lgbt+ friendly as well if you're someone who has homophobia surrounding you/or if you have gender dysphoria. Just an added thing.)

Don't be afraid to reach out to me. I'll listen. To your stories, to your worries. I'll give you advice; if you ask, if you'd like. If you want I can just listen. I can be a friend if you need one. I can keep things lighthearted- hell, I'll send you memes and listen to your interests and share mine. 

Anyway, sending good vibes your way mdudes. You aren't alone. &lt;3",18May2020,1

I’ll be feeling okay and fine then suddenly it feels like I’m completely disconnected to the world around me like I’m high or something and while I feel this disconnected feeling Ill go back and forth between feel such intense levels of despair that I feel like the only thing I can do is lay down and wait to die or feeling a rush absolute frantic energy of “no this is too bad this is too terrible I have to just go kill myself or do something about this right now because like is too awful” and its really scary because I’m still coherent enough to be thinking “what tf is going on what’s wrong with me right now” but I have absolutely no control of the emotions. I’ve never been suicidal or had any thoughts like this before. And like I said most of the time I’m normal and fine. Just every so often this happens and it leaves me absolutely floored. I’m really confused and really scared because I don’t know what’s going on or what’s going to happen. Does anybody have any ideas/ advice? (I will note I’m already going to a therapist and I’m going to tell them but my appointment isn’t for a while and I’m just looking for some help or advice in the meantime. ),18May2020,1
95,"Hi everyone this isn’t something i’m personally struggling with but rather an issue that my friend has opened up about, and i’m not sure how to approach it or what they might potentially have. They have admit to me multiple times that they hate EVERYTHING- they hate breathing, they hate feeling, they hate eating, they hate drinking, they hate thinking, they hate feeling their legs touch when they lay down. They just hate doing and feeling ANYTHING at all. I’ve asked if this is connected at all to their mental state a.k.a are they feeling this because they’re sad and the answer has been no. They tell me that they feel like a lie and a mistake because they have to pretend to like things or tolerate things. They constantly say there’s no point in existing if they will always feel this and that they feel guilty because they know i, among other friends, care about them. They do take anti-depressants but it seems like they have felt this way for as long as they can remember. Is this possibly some sort of serious mental illness? Because that’s what i have assumed it might be, and i come here seeking any advice or if anyone has encountered or experienced such a thing. Thank you so much",18May2020,1
96,"I've tried to post this on r/advice but I feel like this place could be a bit more fitting.

One of my friends had started self-harming herself all rooting from a sense of worthlessness and feeling as if she's undeserving. She's very stubborn and won't listen to any advice that I have tried to give her such as taking a stroll or even trying to talk to someone when she's having such thoughts. It's really hard to convince her otherwise because she literally won't listen to anyone when she's having a breakdown, but pushes people away. For context she and I are both teens and she's leaving for a new school after this semester ends. I really believe that these all came as a result of school but I want to assure her that everything will be okay at the end and that self-harming isn't the mere way out to stress and insecurity. Is there anything I can do or tell her so that she could accept some sort of help? It needs to be something quick in effect as well since she's leaving and this is so recent.",18May2020,1

My little brother has pretty bad mental health issues and he hurt himself really badly yesterday. Every time I close my eyes the events of last night play back in my head. I cried a lot today and last night. I just lie in bed unable to close my eyes and fall asleep because I am so afraid of having another nightmare.

I couldn’t handle seeing him like that with cuts all over his body and hid in my room and listened to music to drown out the voices of the paramedics upstairs talking to him and my mother. I hate my mother for letting me know the details of what happened, I can’t get the images out of my head and I had a terrible nightmare when he left for the hospital. I don’t want to know these things and I hate that she tells me. I am an adult, but this is not something I can handle - I have mental heath issues too and god this has given me insane amounts of anxiety. I just shut down when everything was happening. The smell of his room, of liquor, lingers in my mind still. It felt like a dream when I woke up until I heard my mom telling our family what happened last night over the phone. I knew this was going to happen very soon, it was inevitable, but I was hoping it would not come to this. 

He is ok now, but I know people who try and kill themselves will probably try again. I don’t think he wanted to die, I know he wanted to get help, but it’s still so scary. I don’t think I will ever stop worrying about him now. I have always worried about him, that one day we would find him dead. Now I feel like that  fear is so much worse and I don’t know what to do about it. I can’t live with so much anxiety. He isn’t here, and I know he’s being taken care of at the hospital for the next couple weeks, but he’s going to come home and I am so worried. It’s just so overwhelming. It still feels like a dream. Just a bad dream.",18May2020,1

My LO(1f) was born full term(38wks) but at 3lb8, she stayed in neonatal for 2 weeks. It affected me a lot, I blamed myself A LOT, I honestly still do, what did I do wrong? What could I have done better? She's now a very healthy 20mnth old. 

I've struggled mentally a lot since her birth, I've had so many times where I won't shower for 3 weeks or I won't eat or I'll do nothing but eat, I always make sure she's fed 3 times a day, nappies changed multiple times a day but when I'm really bad, I just about get that done.

Daughter has just gone down from a nap after having the mother of all meltdowns for half an hour (she's gotten 4 canines in 2 weeks), I proceeded to ball my eyes out, feeling something I've done so many times, that I can't do this.

These quotes are not for the faint of heart. 😱 Just goes to show how deep and dark the human mind can get. I read the quotes which appear with a photo of the person who said them. idk...lately I have been learning more about the mental condition known as psychopathy (or, in more clinical terms, antisocial personality disorder) &amp; something about it is just intriguing to me. I'm nowhere near being considered a psychopath/sociopath (!!) But anyways, [here](https://allthatsinteresting.com/serial-killer-quotes#17) is my personal favorite, said by Peter Kürten.

I feel a bit awkward writing To reddit, but at the same time why not. ( sorry if my English is bit broke). 

So... I guess my Mental health is bullcrap and it has Been for a one year now. I am not sure what To Think or Do? But I want To get better. 

I have had some traumatic incidents in my past (abuse, unstable home life, bullying... ) but I have always been quite positive and working hard towards my dreams while still having depressive episodes and sometimes bad anxiety affecting my ability To function. But, I have done work In creative arts so, its quite common for People To be a bit ""crazy""... Uknow. 

BUT after Last spring/autumn my Mental health totally broke down... 
My father almost died, my Mother was quite abusive towards me and I finally got accepted To University (abroad) but long story short everything was  too much for me and after moving abroad my Mental health just finally broke. I Lost Weight, couldn't go outside and puked all Day because I was so anxious. So ofc, I had To dropp Out and move back home.
 It was devastating for me. I feel like such a failure. 

Everything went just More down hill from there, I tryed To work several Jobs but had To quit due To my anxiety. 
I was living with my parents but my father is dipolar alcoholic and my Mother is super anxious and anorecix... Not a good environment at all.
 ( allthoug I Think my parents try their Best... And they have good sides and are ""succesfull""  at least financially, our homelife is a mess). 
And I ended up contemplating ending it all.

Long story short my situation is lot better atm
; I live In a small town with my amazing partner, we both have a short term Job In our local theatre. My dream Job. ( I know its weird how can I act When my anxiety doesnt even allow me To go outside.. Oh well)
 but I am still sick. not able To really function alone, I don't know what would I Do without my partner. I just feel bad and anxious. I am terrified of future. 

I dont have any proffesional help right now. I am trying to seek some. And also I would like to start medication. I want To Heal, I want To have a life: able To go outside alone, dream, meet People etc...

Okay... I guess my question is:

Do you guys have similar experiences?
Is there someone who has survived severe depression and anxiety?

Then we went on deployment to a country to which on here I will not disclose, and I lost my two closest friends in an ambush that the local resistance there set up.... my team retreated and left me there injured in the field with my two dead friends for six hours until they swung back around and pulled me out of the mud..... after we got back home nine months later I couldn’t focus on work, the bullying by my co workers got worse and no matter how much I tried to prove I was a good soldier I was just called “a spotlight ranger” for going the extra mile.... after that they tried to medically discharge me for my back along with “failure to adapt” even though they left me to die...

106,"I don't vent online but I needed somewhere to get my thoughts out, thought it might help this time. 

My mom knits, she has knitted me a cardigan in the past and I love it, wear it all the time. 5 years ago we were out and I found a wool I loved the color of, she said she'd knit me another cardigan with it. So I paid for enough balls for her to knit me a cardigan, using the same design as the previous one. 

She has only just finished the cardigan. Over the course of those 5 years she has knitted so many things for my sister. Each time I'd wonder when she'd knit my cardigan, I patiently and politely kept waiting. Each new project she churned out, sometimes in record time for my sister, some of which she knitted one that my sister didn't seem to like all too much. 

One stage I felt like I was being unappreciative, I understand and appreciate the amount of time and hardwork that goes into knitting. So it got to the point I wanted to commission her for her time, so my cardigan could be worked on next but she dismissed the idea. 

She finished my cardigan and is now working on yet another one for my sister. 

It has rubbed me the wrong way but left me feeling rather worthless, how I had to wait so long, with her knitting a constant stream of things for my sister. and now my cardigan has been done, yet another is being worked on for my sister straight after, she didn't have to wait 5 years. 



I think it's just sunk in, just how long I have waited, politely and patiently waiting for her to get to it. My mom does other things when she isn't knitting but whenever she did go",18May2020,1

The pandemic and being on lockdown has definitely taken a toll on her and it's likely it'll be a while before we can be together in person again. She isn't on antidepressants or seeing a therapist (has been in the past but parents didn't react well). We talked about ways she could try to manage it herself and I suggested sleeping more regularly and more often and establishing daily goals and some kind of routine to give her more of a sense of purpose but I'm not sure what else to suggest. What helps you when you are struggling and how could I support her properly (without crossing any boundaries)?",18May2020,1
114,"I don’t know if this is the right place to post this but I genuinely don’t know where to get information about this as everything I’ve looked up so far just makes me think I’m crazier than I already am. TLDR at the bottom of the post if you don’t want to read my rambling.

So pretty much I’ve been sensing a woman in my room who I know wants to kill me. I’ve named her because that kind of makes this less scary, but I’m also not sure if that’s a good thing. It first happened about two months ago, right around when covid really started to kick off. I’ll be laying in my dark room on my phone when I’ll suddenly be very aware of another person in my room, despite not being able to see anybody due to the darkness of the room and the bright light of my phone. Every time this happens I freeze up because I can tell that if I move too much, speak, or try to look at her even a little bit, then she will kill me.

Obviously this is in my head. I have spoken to friend on call once while this was happening, breaking the rule about not being able to speak. It made me very panicked and in the moment I was very concerned that I was going to be attacked and killed. Obviously, since I‘m writing this, nothing happened and I just got majorly anxious and had to leave the call early. So I’m pretty sure this isn’t like a demon or actual person in my room doing this. That leaves my brain.

I guess why I’m writing this is because I like to know what’s going on and I don’t right now? I don’t know if I’m schizophrenic, majorly paranoid, or just going stir crazy due to the stay at home order. Any insight into what I should do about this / what it might be would be very helpful. 

I’m a 20 yr old female if that changes anything.

115,"I'm so tired of everything. When I was in 7th grade, I had a huge depressive episode with self harm and suicide attempts which lead me to be hospitalized 2 days. I went in therapy but I stopped after a bit less than a year I think because I felt like a financial burden to my parents.

Now I suffer from untreated depression and anxiety and this lockdown is fucking awfull for me. I had a lot of difficulties to follow school properly before and now it's even worse. I can't work, I can't do any king of school work without feeling overwhelmed. I just spend my day doing nothing and I don't feel particulary guilty about it. What I hate is that my parents don't listen to me. They don't listen when I try to explain them that it's not I don't want to work, I can't work. I try really hard but all they do is calling me ""lazy"" or yelling on me when they see me doing nothing. And I don't like that, I don't think they understand how much it hurts me when they keep on remembering me everything I don't do. But they don't want to listen to me, each time I try to explain how they are wrong they start yelling and I don't support this.

Background: 21M, no disorders I am aware of, I come from a healthy background. 

Problem: Whilst meditating this morning, I realised I needed to do something. 

I sometimes insult people I love,  always in my thoughts and for absolutely no reason. I can think of my mother, my ex-girfriend (broke up recently) or my grandmother for example.  These are rare events but they happen from time to time and it's been like that for a few years (I can't  exactly tell when it started). I felt guilty and weird but told myself there were no reasons to worry about it, since it couldn't harm them, being just thoughts. These thoughts never came in a context of arguing or anything similar. They were unjustified and out of place. The last one I can think of was a few days ago, after I met my girlfriend after two months of self isolation with my family. We were having sex and I qualified her of ""dumb bitch"" in my thoughts. I felt disgusting as I really cared about her and she was incredibly kind to me. If relevant, I must say I have delayed ejaculation and sometimes couldn't come. I think it's a psychological problem (difficulty to relax or maybe refusing to let myself enjoy it? I don't know). The insult came out whilst I was struggling to reach climax. I decided to break up with her because I realised I wasn't in love anymore (after two months of distance). It was difficult because she still was in love with me, but I couldn't do it anymore. Might be related, I don't know. This is just an example and it's not limited to my sex life, as these poisonous thoughts also popped up in normal and average discussions with other people, such as my mother. I can't remember them because that was a while ago.

I feel really messed up and can't understand why this sometimes happens to me. Any suggestion would be more than welcome. Thank you!

either im trying to piece all the puzzle pieces together, or im actually psychologically going insane and not knowing it. which im fine with that? i just want to at least find a label so i can try to better myself. 

there was a time before where i was depressed, but nowhere near as complicated or sad or angry or lost or feeling-like-im-going-insane as right now. so im gonna skip to the beginning of right now instead.

i was probably the happiest ive been for awhile. usually i had little patches of sadness here and there but thats just my depression doing its thing. 

then one day a rash appeared on my neck and a little bit of my chest, i was prescribed prednisone, (around september) and around that time i also started to feel close to nothing with my feelings. some sadness and anger, lots of anger,- it changed my whole personality while i was on it. 

we got off of it as quickly as we could. but i dont really think i ever changed back since then. either that, or it triggered something worse in me because after that it felt like a fast descent into hell. 

i havent felt genuine happiness since then; and i dont love my family any more. i used to cry at every little thing but now the only thing i cry about is me. and i hate myself for it. 

now this could have caused psychosis or derealization/depersonalization, but when i asked my doctor about any of those possibilities, he shut me down and said its not likely whats happening. 

then as time went on i started eating more- binge eating. i was approached by a doctor and was told theres a possibility of binge eating disorder, but i refused to believed it and also as time went on i gained weight.

while that time was going on i started to experience a deep decline in my confidence. where i have to look in a mirror as often as possible to see if my flaws are there- and im triggered every time by it. every time i see a person who looks remotely like me i get triggered- spending nearly all day worrying about my looks.

one of my doctors is going to give me a test soon to see if anything else is going on. 

obviously i may sound way out of line thinking this could be anything more than just depression- and if it is i just need to ask a different doctor if its because of the prednisone. but it feels so much worse than that. ive experienced things ive never experienced before. 

not only what i put above, and all the other classic depression symptoms, but also just feeling out of touch with reality. my eyes dont seem right. blurry isnt the right word- more like soft? 

if anyone else has experienced anything remotely like this, or have any recommendations on what i should ask my doctor, i’d be grateful. i know i said i have little to no feelings anymore but i can still feel a little grateful.",18May2020,1

125,"Recently Ive been getting into issues with everything. Before the pandemic, I just couldnt get myself to get up for work. I cant get myself to do schoolwork. Overall I just cant get myself to do much of anything asked of me. The simplest tasks seem too hard, and no matter how much i would like to, i just cant bring myself to do anything reasonably productive. simply bringing any of it up pisses me off to an extreme; which is only happening constantly. I cant find much of anything i want to do. games get boring just after a few minutes. my mind is just too active to sleep; and I just cant bring myself to go out, or do anything else. I keep setting goals, and making plans; but i just cant do it. beyond that, im not suicidal, but I cant help but stir the thought. I feel like Im being bullied by my own head, like were not even the same person. Im paranoid to an extreme; no longer feeling safe in my own house, like im living in a horror movie. every little thing makes me jump, and im on constant guard, my sleep schedule has been practically flipped because of it. the topic itself just hurts, sometimes physically and I just dont know what the problem is.

126,"Good morning to all. I think I need help, scratch that, I know I need help. I'm an early 30s first generation American. My family came from another country and essentially lived the American dream - from looking for money in a couch to buy me a happy meal to moving to one of the most affluent towns outside of NYC. I cannot express how thankful I am to them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a younger sibling who is a drug addict - started with cocaine and has now been heroin for 7-8 years. This has really torn my family apart. From the age of 19 to now, everything in my family life has revolved around my sibling and her addiction. We are not a family of talkers, just doers. As such, my family and I have supported her the best we can during this time of her life.  I would also like to add here that I smoke weed for recreational purposes. I have no tried any ""hard drugs"" but do indulge in the flower.  

&amp;#x200B;

But being a sibling to a heroin addict is hard. It is so hard. I have seen my sibling OD at least 6 times, I have had to pick her up from the most unsavory and disgusting places, dealt with the worst people, had my personal belongings stolen and pawned and re-bought my me (think laptop with years of professional work on it), been attacked by my high sibling with a firepoker, a knife, been told to sleep with one eye open, have seen my sister manipulate and abuse my older parents for close to half a decade now. I've been to the hospital to see her more times than I can remember. 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story for a short drink of water: I have been through so much trauma with my parents when it comes to my sister. My parents who are my rocks have been through hell and back dealing with my sister's addiction. In my culture, we love unconditionally and my parents have truly shown to me what that is. I admire them for it. We try to help to my sister but she refuses to seek help or get help. I will also say, she has had a very very tough life due to her addiction. She has suffered serious trauma many times and it breaks my heart, truly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so many emotions tied to this. Guilt, sadness, anger, frustration, and finally numbness. Being happy to me or investing in myself always feels fleeting as I have to always be prepared for the inevitable ""your sister is in a hospital"" or ""We can't find your sister, please help us"" call from my parents. I always feel like my world can be shattered at any moment without my consent from no fault of my own. It is the worst feeling and it is hard, just so hard to be happy. When shit hits the proverbial fan, I isolate and numb myself in unhealthy ways with excessive weed usage, video games, and general piss poor behaviors that I am not proud of but help me sustain and not breakdown. To combat this, I have rules for myself where I do not smoke alone or play online competitive video games.

&amp;#x200B;

I need help and I don't know what to do or how to go about it. I am asking where to start, how to start.

130,"Made a new account because I don't want people being influenced by old posts, just want people to go off what comes across from this post, with me trying to be as honest as possible.

Reasons I think I may be a narcissist:

* Extreme Liar (I used to lie constantly, kinda fixed it now, but I am still wrapped in stupid things due to my stupidity, and still trying to resolve them)
* Constantly want validation (I keep posting everything I do online, really wanting attention, I always try and show off my programming and games and what I know, which is hella annoying)
* Lots of people, who don't necessarily know each other, often comment on how much I want attention
* I like to be in control (I always try to get *my* idea to be the thing that we do in groups)

There are more reasons, but they are quite trivial, but this stuff really seems to kinda add up.

I'm happy as I am, but I want *other people* to be happy, not just me, and me being this way obviously doesn't make them happy, and making them cakes and helping them do things isn't going to change the fact that I am a really bad friend in terms of my personality.

131,"Can anxiety/panic disorder cause you to feel like you’re constantly on a boat? Cause it’s been 8 long ass months of feeling like this and nobody can figure it out. It feels like I’m moving when I’m not, like I’m swaying/off balanced, woozy, almost a drunk like feeling, and at times it feels like the ground is moving from underneath me. It’s constantly there, at its worst when standing/sitting still, subsides when walking, and laying down and goes when I’m in a moving vehicle. 
I’ve always been a bit of an anxious person and I was really anxious when I was a kid. 
I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD, but I honestly don’t think I’ve got it. It all started about 2 months after I quit smoking weed. Smoked weed for 5 years (17-22) I’m now 23. This symptom has caused severe anxiety/health anxiety and panic disorder, which has almost resulted in being admitted to the psych ward, I’m not only on antidepressants but also an antipsychotic and for a hot minute there benzodiazepines, however I’ve almost been panic free for about a month, and am tapering off the antipsychotic which is great but this physical symptom is still there. I’ve had heaps of tests including an MRI, vertigo testing, blood tests, eyes, ears and  heart checked also tried tablets that are supposed to help with balance but it didn’t help. I have a benign cyst in my left temporal lobe that’s been there since I was a kid but like I mentioned above I had an MRI and it hadn’t changed, so the doctors just keep saying it’s anxiety. If this is the case, how do I try and make it stop? It’s literally ruining my life. I’ve made so many lifestyle changes and nothing has helped, I haven’t quit smoking cigarettes so I suppose I could try that? I should also mention that this all started after a weekend away spent in a high rise building in which I had to use an elevator numerous times, so I don’t know if the elevator has anything to do with it? I have also developed other symptoms but am also unsure whether that’s due to anxiety/panic, such as, episodes that feel similar to a hypoglycaemic attack, consisting of weak/faint/shaky/sweaty sensations, this usually always occurs at the same time of day. 
The other symptoms are these tingly, pins and needle like sensations, hot and cold sensations and random patches of goosebumps.

134,"School life, or early college life for that matter, is not as simple as many would have you believe. From group dynamics to image maintenance to early tryst with relationships, there are a ton of factors that they have to navigate through, pretty much on their own. With the popularity of social media and easy access to smartphones for today’s teens, the issues have magnified. Hence, the importance of a [therapist for teens](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/teen-therapy/) in today’s society has increased a lot. Even today, the idea of therapy for young adults seems like an alien concept for many. In a world where even adults have to either hide that they are going for therapy or dismiss the concept altogether, this should not come as a shocker. But, circling back to teens and why teens need therapy, the fact of the matter is that in today’s world, there are so many issues that teens face but are not always emotionally equipped to handle them well. Add to that, some teens are not very close to their parents, so they turn to their friends for advice and that is never a good decision. So, what are these issues that teens face? Let us discuss a few.

**1.** **Substance abuse: -** More often than not, some sort of abuse is at the centre of all the issues. With urban teens having access to the internet so readily, it also makes accessing illegal substances extremely easy. Sometimes, a teen is the initiator while others follow suit because of peer pressure. Results of substance abuse are no longer a secret, and everyone knows what can happen to a person. It is extremely important to recognise signs of substance abuse and address them right away. If you are looking for a [therapist for teens in Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/teen-therapy/), you should not have any issues finding one. The city has some of the best therapists in India. It is important to maintain dialogue with a teen. Talk to them, ask them about their issues and make them feel safe. A hostile environment at home is the breeding ground of early life issues that can further lead to substance abuse. 

**2.** **Stress -** Yes, stress is an extremely broad factor, but it is also an extremely important one. As adults, with experience, we get used to the stress. We find ways to dissipate it or manage it. But teens, like we have mentioned above, are not emotionally equipped to handle stress very well. Now, stress can be cause by many factors, like studies, peer pressure, social media anxiety and more. It is important to continue having a conversation with them. As we have mentioned, if you are on the lookout for a [therapist for teens Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/teen-therapy/) has some of the best ones in India. It is never too late to seek help and above all, it is not a reason to feel shameful. But the only way you will know that you, teen needs therapy is if you just talk to them.",18May2020,2
135,"My brother (m/20)  for a while has gotten so bad he is unapproachable. I (m/18) cant really look at him anymore without being overcome by some type of selfish emotion of either anger or anxiety. For about 2 years now he's been walking in circles and laughing/talking to himself, sometimes he comes back into reality and talks to me and my mom but for most of the day he's in this kind of vegetative state where if you try to break him out of he will get very hostile.

138,"I’m afraid of participating in the stigma of minimizing mental illness to “normal” emotions and behaviors (like how someone who’s sad for the time being says their depressed or stuff like that) and I generally stay away from self-diagnosing but this has made me reluctant to ask for help.
I’m afraid to ask for professional help because I don’t want to create a problem for my parents or my partner. What if I’m just sad? Lately, I’ve been having thoughts of just ending it for myself. I’ve been feeling cornered because of my problems in my relationship with my partner and family. It’s not fully their fault, though (if even at all), since I know I participate in creating the problem in some way. It’s just that I’ve been feeling more and more like I can’t handle these problems anymore. Like I don’t want to, and that it’s not worth it. I know I can be happy but it’s not really about that either. It’s just I feel like that’s not really giving me peace and I want to be peaceful.

I’m afraid that if I bring this up to my partner, he’ll feel this extra burden of having to deal with someone with these problems aside from his own problems. He’ll say he won’t mind and that he wants us to deal with it together, but that won’t mean it won’t be hard and heavy for him to do so.
With my family, I’m afraid they won’t understand. My parents aren’t firm believers of these kinds of problems.

If I go to a professional (assuming I have the resources), what would I even say? What if it really is just me and I’m just making a big deal out of small problems I have? I know mental illnesses are serious and deserve to be taken seriously, but a part of me believes that I’m just overreacting and suicidal thoughts doesn’t mean I’ll commit suicide therefore I’m not suicidal. And if I do have issues, I don’t know how they’ll ever be fixed because I’ve been feeling this way for so long.",18May2020,1
139,"Hello, people this is my first time posting. I would like some advice. Recently I moved in with my father in law due to loosing my job to covid. The first week my wife and I saw a lady walking up our street. We thought nothing of it. Maybe it was just someone going for a walk and that was fine. Until it wasn't, we were in the house when my wife decided to go to the backyard. I was cooking at the time and she called me practically just after she walked out. She asked me if there was a woman standing at the end of the driveway. I checked and there was a woman standing in front of our driveway looking at the garage but spacing out at the same time. I informed her of this and then she started walking away. Not even 10 minutes later I hear the door open. My wife opened the door and said ""SHE'S HERE."" So, I went outside to see what she needed. At this point she is standing in the driveway 15 feet away from the side door. I asked her if she was lost. She told me she was looking for Frank. I informed her he didn't live here and that we had just moved here. Her dad has been living here for about a year. This resonated with her and she left. We were pretty freaked out at this point but we continued with our day. Two days later she showed up again. Only this time its 10 pm. My wife went to throw something in the trash and she was standing at the end of the driveway. It was pitch black. All you could see was her face. She stood there for 15 minutes without blinking till the cops showed up. I'm not sure what the officer told her but she headed back home. At this point we are loosing our shit thinking we were going to get killed or something. The cop informs us that she is schizophrenic. Apparently she used to take care of someone who had dementia in the house I now live in. This made us feel bad for her because hell nobody chooses to be like that. The officer informed us that she actually lives in one of the houses adjacent from ours. After this we talked to my wife's sister about it. She told us the cops have been called twice on this house saying a ""young couple"" keeps banging at her door. I think she might be able to see us in the backyard as we used to visit often. I don't know what her living situation is like but something about her maybe seeing us as the young couple concerns me. She showed up yet again yesterday except this time she was more ""put together?"" The first time she showed up she had a mask and talked to us. The second time she didn't even wear a coat or a mask and it was aqq cold day. Yesterday she came with a coat and her mask on and she didn't ask about Frank. She asked about a woman named Catherine. She said she keeps telling her to go to the backyard. Frank had also told her he was in the backyard. She apologized and left. I'm not sure if she remembers coming the other two times or not. I'm worried frank or Catherine are going to tell her to come inside. Or even think we want to hurt her. I'm worried for her as well I think maybe having to be cooped up inside during all this might be damaging her mental health. I know I'm starting to feel it so I can only imagine. So reddit what should I do? Part of me wants to maybe get to know her and talk to her. I don't know if that's wise or even how to go about it. She lives near to us so I don't see this going away any time soon.

I’ve always had issues with social anxiety and perfectionism, especially when I inevitably do something wrong, often because of the anxiety.

Got CBT towards the end of last year and it got better. 

Mental health nosedived when COVID-19 and lockdown started. Now instead of one thing or the future, I’ve started ruminating, fixating on, and remembering every single wrong, rude, or embarrassing things I’ve ever done. We’re talking going back nearly twenty years (I’m 23F) and things I’d already forgotten, so no one else is likely to remember but somehow they’ve come back, and with a vengeance like never before. 

Clearly I have some deep seated issues and childhood trauma that can’t be suppressed forever. 

Had a phone consult with a therapist today, and cried for the first time since COVID-19 started. Finally it all came out. I’ll be ok eventually. Just slightly devastated that I feel like I’ve failed in some way, and that I underestimated how bad my issues were.

157,"Hey, everyone. This is my first time posting here. Or posting something like this in general. I just don't know where else to post this. I feel completely destroyed inside. My head is a mess and I don't know where to look.

I just ended a friendship with one of the most closest friends I've ever had. She was extremely important to me and I was the same to her. We'd talk to each other every single day, about our lives, our frustrations, our problems both personal and even family and we had some great memories together. I got to know her in college and we've been close friends ever since for 9 years. We make fun of each other, I make the bad jokes and she always laughed at them to make me feel better anyway. We've helped each other through several problems and we've been the better for it. I thought this was the kind of friendship that doesn't ever end. The kind that would go on even when we've both retired from our careers. The reason we ended is because I made a joke about one of her insecurities. She has anxiety and went through some horrible things because of her ex. Suffice to say it wasn't the kind of joke that's brushed off or forgivable. My intentions were never to hurt her feelings. It was the kind of mean-ish harmless joke I always make. But this time it just wasn't forgivable. It's happened before and we've fought and we've always made up. But this time she told me that we shouldn't be friends anymore. I know I shouldn't have said what I said. She said she doesn't feel safe with me anymore and that she doesn't want a repeat of what she went through emotionally with her ex. I thought this was going to be another fight where even though I'm in the wrong, I'd apologize sincerely and we'd move on like we always do. Was I wrong in thinking that we were as close as I thought we were? She ended it saying she didn't want to take any risks and that even thought she's not mad at me, that this is for the better. I don't know if I sound like a crazy person right now and that I probably deserved what I got but I just thought that 9 years of friendship would mean something and that we'd get through this. I don't hate her or resent her. I just feel completely broken inside. Funny thing is, I'd talk to her about problems like these but I guess that won't happen. I don't know how to feel. I hate myself for making her feel that being friends with me is a risk to her emotional health. I don't know how to feel or how to put it into words but I feel like I just lost a huge part of my life and it's completely my fault. I hate myself. I don't feel right.",18May2020,1

Due to severe trust issues I’ve been almost 100% closed off about these thoughts, because therapists/teachers/etc. are mandated reporters and I didn’t want to get sent to the psych ward.

Eventually I got sick of suffering alone and decided that maybe I could vent my thoughts on Reddit without risk of being reported.

For a while, it worked. People could understand me and relate without risk of being reported or exposed.

It felt great being able to open up.

Until, one day I made a particularly concerning post about my dark thoughts. Someone reported me to the police.

I was sleeping peacefully when the police came into my apartment, slammed me against the wall, and handcuffed me. They threw me into the car (with no leg room) and off to the psych ward I went.

I stayed for three weeks in literal living hell just for risking being honest about my suicidal thoughts.

Also, they permanently terminated my account when I got back.

160,"Hey there, I’m a 19 year old who has generalized anxiety disorder. I’ve had mild-severe anxiety my whole life, and it’s always up and down depending on what’s going on in my life. I also have severe depression. A few years ago when I was 16 I was hospitalized multiple times for panic attacks and started developing very new anxiety symptoms, such as dissociation and depersonalization. I had no idea what was going on and was very terrified and miserable 24/7. 


I was also very paranoid about my health and always thought I had some kind of disease. I think it was brought on by a really terrible, traumatizing panic attack after smoking weed (although I smoked all the time) which led to me going to the ER, thinking I was having a heart attack and on the verge of dying. I don’t smoke anymore because every time now I have a panic attack. I did go to counseling but stopped and eventually got over it by myself somehow. 


That was 3 years ago, and I haven’t had terrible anxiety like that since then, only a few times. Ever since this pandemic started I can feel it creeping back up again and I’m terrified. I’m starting to feel like things aren’t real and I’m constantly paranoid about my health and about getting the virus. I’m convinced that because I smoke cigarettes (only have for a year) and I am a bit overweight (but not huge) that I will have no chance if I got the virus. I only smoke about 1-3 cigarettes a day now but I’m still terrified. I barely get sleep and if I do it’s during the day. I’m scared that I won’t be able to handle it and I’ll end up killing myself, although I’m terrified of death and I’m definitely not suicidal.


But dissociation is probably the most terrifying thing I’ve ever experienced, and I don’t know if I’m strong enough to deal with this again. Even talking about it gives me anxiety. I don’t know what to do, I’m really scared. I do have a therapist and I have talked about this with her before but that was before this wave started, but I am going to talk about it with her tomorrow.
Any advice would be appreciated, I feel very alone because I don’t know anyone who has anxiety this bad or has experienced dissociation like I have. I just need someone to talk to or someone who can relate. My boyfriend understands and is really nice and has experienced it too, but I feel like a burden on him because my anxiety gets so bad.",18May2020,1

Since I've gotten pregnant I've been extremely unwell, I've been in bed most of the time because I'm constantly nauseous or vomiting. And in correlation with this, my social anxiety and depression has gotten a lot worse. It's gotten to the point where my fiance has to make phone calls for me because I'm too scared to talk on the phone.

The main issue is I'm socially anxious around my parents-in-law. I have absolutely no reason to be, they are lovely people and very welcoming. But I'm just so nervous around them, and this is incredibly difficult considering I live with them. I'm too nervous to leave the bedroom and go downstairs without my fiance, so I'm literally restricted to the bedroom all day and it's driving me mad.

I am not interested in anything, no hobbies or interests. Nothing matters anyway. Im only living bc of the love I have for my fiance. I have some friends but I could drop them and feel the exact same. Weed and alchohol are the only thing to give me feeling. And why are those things bad?

""Depression is your body telling you that it doesnt want to play the character you have created anymore."" To quote Jim Carrey. I am a copy of everyone. Nothing is my own thoughts. I'm controlled in every way. If I dont go college, I cant get a job (i had to drop out bc of my mental health). I have to pay for shelter, work a miserable job (I hate every job i get and quit them in less than a year), i have to work or i will die. Bc money is the main thing controlling us. Our whole lives are to grow up and earn money to live.  My family controlled how I SHOULD think, and being a kid, I had no other choice. So their terrible choice fucked my whole life, forced religion on me, and their own beliefs (good and bad beliefs) and now I have no idea who I am. It really is like I am a character who's just pretending to live a life of boredom and pain. ""Do stuff that makes you happy or speaks something in you"" okay, well nothing does!!!I dont even know how to further explain how I feel. But I feel like this doesnt even do this justice. I'm sick of the pain and the crying and miserableness. I'm on meds now, but I still feel the exact same about life, except now I'm becoming a robot.

In the last couple of years I've become very self-conscious on how other people perceive me based on my image, especially other fellow gays and it has damaged my mental health a lot to the point I've become addicted to Grindr (a gay dating app) and started developing some very toxic and unhealthy habits. **I can't stand watching myself being a mess anymore**, and since it feels like my life is depending on how I look, I think **it's time I lock myself out and make big drastic changes** (lose tons of weight, quit social media for that time, save money for my bucket list, focus on my personal projects etc.)  and so I thought of taking a semester off so I can make the transformation stress-free.

I think that changing myself **during my studies** will slow the process even more and I'm not sure if I will give up again just like I did multiple times in past trying to change myself because of the stress I get. It will also make me feel vulernable and exposed. I don't want to share my transformation process with anyone or even my family.

175,"Hey guys! New poster here, I'm trying to do something positive during quarantine so here it goes!

I've struggled with severe panic attacks and agoraphobia for years. One day talking to my therapist he recommend a simple technique of, snapping a rubber band on my wrist.

The thought is, it distracts and grounds the mind and over time actually helps to correct the negative thoughts or behaviors.

It can be used for depression, anxiety, OCD, stress, etc.

When I would feel a anxiety or panic attack come on I would just start snapping the band and focus on the sensation, it was a form of grounding and allowed me something to focus on and was a great tool in managing my anxiety.

So one day I got to thinking of creating a bracelet that would be more durable then a rubber band because they constantly break and also look better as I'd get questions about why I was wearing a rubber band.

So for the last few months I've been working it and am finally at a point where I wanna share it.

I named it the Snap-Out bracelet. As its intended to snap you out of whatever your feeling, anxiety, depression, compulsive thoughts etc.

I made these out of a mixed rubber compound so they can be elastic yet durable. They Come in a bunch of colors as well!

I really wanted to create something that was helpful and did some good so I also am donating $1 per every bracelet sold to NAMI ( National Alliance on Mental Illness)

This May never take off like I hope, but if I could help a few people even in a small way I think it be worth it.

178,"I am not sure if this is the right sub to post in, please inform me if there is a more suitable one. I'm using an alt account for privacy reasons.

To start off, my father has not been the best father he could be. Whenever I would not obey him or be 'disrespectful' to whatever dumb standard he had, he would get very angry and violent. Especially against me. And I'm not talking just spanking or anything, it was quite serious. This began at a young age until I was about thirteen or fourteen, when my mother finally divorced him. 

Now, my father frequently comes over to have supper with us and leaves shortly after. This is because my younger sister really loves him and would miss him if he were to stay away for a long period of time. I think my mother would, too. He was never violent against my younger sister, so I can understand that she would feel for him. I don't resent him at all by the way, my mom always told me I should love him with the explanation that, at the end of the day, he IS my father and he was trying the best he could. 

So since the divorce, we never really talked about the whole violence thing. We just kind of swept it under the carpet. I didn't have any problem with it, I just wanted to live my life normally. 

Today, my father came over, we had dinner, just the usual. After dinner I was sitting on the couch, playing on my phone. My dad walked over and asked me to search something for him on google. I did, but immediately after I felt very anxious. It wasn't a panic attack, but something close to it. I felt like I had to get out of there and be anywhere but in the same room as him. I couldn't even look at him. I went upstairs to my room and broke down crying and could not stop.

At one point I had gotten so depressed and lonely I felt like I had no control of my life, I thought about suicide, but I didn't go through with it. 

Eventually I developed a fantasy world where I was the main character and I had lots of friends, and had absolute control of my life, it felt great I was no longer lonely. But then I had problems with believing the world I had dreamt up was real and that this world was the dream, and no one could tell me otherwise. 

I couldn't seek out therapy at the time for a number of reasons. So for a while it only got worse. Then a family friend died, and me and my mom had to take care of his wife who had Alzheimer's. So I was right at the center of a harsh reality and my fantasy world came crashing down.

I stopped believing in the fantasy world, I stopped believing in everything. And I fell back into the depression. And once again considered suicide.

But then I found some social groups and started socializing more, and I was doing well other than some anxiety for the last 6 years.

Sorry for the long read.

If it's relevant I'm a 21m I'm not from the US and my first language isn't english, so, sorry in advance.

This last year has been very tough for me.

Starting with the fact that my girlfriend decided to end our relationship of two years on june last year (we were not okay at that point), but she keeps coming back every two months telling me she wants to try again and make it work. I'm still in love with her so I say yes, we try for a month and then she leaves again saying she doesn't feel comfortable and is scared of telling her parents and friends. She is very fickle minded and gets jnfluenced a lot by her friends thoughts and opinions. To add a little context we study the same major at the same college so we share a lot of classes and friends, we see each other a lot because of this. Two months ago (March) she told me she had been seeing a guy last year when we were on and off (she can't be alone for long periods of time, I started out as a ""rebound"" from her previous ex). It obviously hurt me because, despite I had sex one time with another girl, I didn't had feelings for that girl. When my ex told me about this we were trying to build something again. Next month (April) she told me she just wanted to be friends with me. I'm in quarantine because of coronavirus so all I do is think about her and worry about what she's doing, who she's talking to and all of that. It really is making me sick and I can't seem to control it. I can never fully heal because she keeps coming back, opening the wound and leaving.

I've lost a lot of hair and I feel super insecure about myself, I worry that no one's gonna like me ever again. I don't look good enough in the mirror. I've always thought my ex was more attractive than me, so she has 0 problems getting a rebound or another guy whereas I struggle more, because, as we know, it's expected for the man to make the first move to initiate something with a girl. I feel too insecure to do it. 

My father lost his job more than a year ago and my mom doesn't make enough to pay all the bills and stuff. This is also the reason why I won't graduate from college with all of my friends, I had to take less clases because of money. I do work, but the majority of it goes to helping in my house through this rough patch and paying for my stuff. My parents offered me to go to a psychologist but its too expensive (around 40$ an hour) and I don't want them to get more in to debt.

I've talked about this several times with my best friend, she's very supportive and does everything she can but I don't want her to put up with my shit so much. These things I've listed here are the most recent ones, but I have another one or two unresolved problems with myself. I know a lot of you guys are going through worse times, but I hope you can help me. I'm not doing well at all and I want to stop that.

I think what hurts me and upsets me the most is the fact that I've always been the funny/goofy guy and I don't feel like that anymore, I think I've lost my spark.

189,"For some background, I am in my 20s. I saw a therapist as a kid for grief counseling after a close family member passed away. My parents sprung it on me out of nowhere and I *dreaded* that first visit. My therapist turned out to be an amazing woman and I saw her for about a year and a half. I was devastated when we lost our insurance and I had to stop seeing her. I've seen one therapist since and there's a whole bunch of drama around that I won't get into. The bottom line is I'm in need of a new therapist.

So today I called my hospital in search of a new therapist. I had done some research for a new therapist already but my mom prefers I find a therapist within our medical group to make sure our insurance covers it. I had to call and give some basic information to a nurse. She will give it to the mental health coordinator (that's not the right title but I already forgot what she said) who will call me to answer some more questions about my mental health. From there, the coordinator will match me with a therapist that may suit my needs.

I'm absolutely *terrified*. I feel like a kid again, not knowing who I might be paired with or what I'm getting into. I know this is what I need right now, but I still have so much anxiety around it. I am still extremely grateful to have these resources available to me, as I know lots of people struggling right now that are not as fortunate.",18May2020,1

I sought the help of my best friend. She was blunt, then ignored me and then blocked me. I was so ready to because if my best friend can just cut me off like that, then whats the point? 

Obviously I didn't as I've just written this. The point is, no matter how hard shit gets, I'm fine. The thing to do is to add ""for now"" at the end of it. I wanted to die, for now. I am angry, for now. I was sitting there, sobbing my heart out at the fact no one cares - No one needs to care. I care and that's it. 

I wanted an easy solution to a temporary problem, my goal in life is to be that person that I never had. It was so selfish of me to take away someone's friend, lifeline, smile perhaps. I'm happy writing this, because despite being that far off the edge, I still came back.

This is a long one.... 


My (F26) father recently lost his job after being dismissed for bullying and harassment. He’s having a really hard time and is severely depressed. I’m currently in therapy due to things I did and I have worked out with a therapist that my father emotionally abused and neglected me. The other day I was feeling very guilty and conflicted because although I don’t think my dad should have been sacked, I could sympathise with his accusers at work. I told my Mom this and told her I felt bad about it. After this, I noticed my Mom was being off with me, so I text her and asked her why she was being funny with me. She replied “It sounds like you think your Dad should have been sacked”. Her saying this triggered me big time and I lashed out a little over text saying that was not the case and reminding her of all the times he’d bullied us in the past and all the times she’d sat there and supported him. I only said this because what she said made me feel really bad, as if I wasn’t feeling guilty already. After this, my Mom and Dad say downstairs and my Mom told my Dad the texts I had sent her and that I thought he was a bully. What happened after was 12 hours of emotional and verbal abuse (directed at me, stating I was a failure and was basically tainted), at first I was arguing back with my father but in the end gave up and agreed with him. I told him I didn’t blame him for the bullying (I’m very big on childhood trauma and can also sympathise with him) but he wouldn’t accept it. One minute he was crying and hugging me, the next he was cursing at me. I followed him around for 12 hours because he said he was going to commit suicide and kept playing mind games. I had not touched any alcohol but I felt drunk. I felt like I was going crazy and I called an ambulance because I was terrified. Meanwhile, my Mom was very, VERY drunk and my brother just called me an idiot and went out. My Dad said I was evil because I kicked him when he was down and I was worse than the people accusing him at work. I told him I stay away from my family (I.e in my bedroom) a lot because I don’t want the confrontation. You can’t have an opinion in my house. I’m also terrified that I will turn in to my Dad. He said that I am what I am and he is what he is and we can never change. He also said I contributed to my Brother being a nasty kid. My brother is five years younger than me.

I know I shouldn’t have angrily text my Mom but I never, ever wanted to drag up things from the past. I was simply doing it to tell her how I was feeling. I also found out that everything i had told her about my mental illness (in confidence) she had told my Dad. Because we’re going through a hard time, I am willing to let it go for now, but I feel like I am a changed person. And I feel plagued with guilty. If my Dad kills himself it will be because of me. 

Can anyone give me any advice. I’ve spoken to friends but sometimes advice is better coming from an outsider, in my opinion.",18May2020,1

193,"Hello, this is my first post here.

So over the last month I've been experiencing similar extremely vivd dreams relevant to the same exact event that I'm struggling in real life with. Someone I was extremely close has left my life for their own reasons, and while I try to accept that and I don't reach out anymore, I'm still extremely dissatisfied with how things are and it's hard to move on. I thought time would be the solution but it seems that my own mind is against me, as every night in my dreams an extremely similar set of events happens: we meet, we talk and we become friends again. Sometimes it might be in different ways, different contexts, different situations, even while implementing elements from my days or events that happened in real life, so I wouldn't say it's a matter of having the same dream but coming up with the same pleasantry every night.

This repeating happy thought in my dreams haunts me once I wake up knowing I still cannot reach out to that person and I still cannot reconnect. It's haunting me how I live out my outmost desire every night to wake up in this world I don't like. I have had occasions where I'd sleep through my alarms and my classes until the dreams ended, even if I was well rested and such.

Today I woke up at 6pm after an 11 hour sleep and the happiest dream so far, and reality hit me like a truck, it's getting harder to study on my finals and focus on my responsibilities, as getting out of bed in the morning is getting harder and harder, as is accepting the situation I am currently in. I am at a loss on what to do, how to move on and how to discipline my mind into behaving correctly.

194,"What's so fun about life really? Wake up, school, work, do all your duties and have a tiny bit of time left over. But you're so done for the day it's not really your time anymore.

Some days I get a wave of unhappiness. On other days I can remind myself that, hey, the outside is kinda pretty and food is nice, friends can make me happy and I'm doing something I have a bit of passion for. But in that wave it doesn't matter to me anymore. I'm just done with it.

I get so overwhelmed. I actually need to find a new job but I'm hesitant because I'm scared it'll become overwhelming. When I see other people I start overthinking, what would they think of me, is my speech normal, should I be walking different? I have a hard time getting into routines. I sleep at different hours each day and my personal hygiene is at irregular intervals too. 

Everytime I start a routine it breaks down on itself. I tried exercising but it didn't work out. I'm also too scared to go to the gym so I just did bodyweight exercises at home. I've never really exercised so I'm incredibly weak and do everything with wrong form.

And I have almost no friends. I almost never go outside except for when I need to get something done. I wouldn't even know where to start to find friends. There's always such a distance between me and another person. It never really clicks.

My face has become so gloomy. I used to be a happy, relatively optimistic person. Even my mother has told me: ""You look a lot more sad and tired these days. I guess it's because you've become an adult, with all the responsibilities you now have."" I wish I could return to the days where everything could make me laugh, but I think it's not possible anymore. It's been too long. I've become what I am now, I guess I will have to accept that.

I see other people and ask myself, how do they do it? What makes it so easy, why doesn't everything weigh them down?

And instead of doing something useful, I just stare away into a screen. For a minute, an hour, becoming days which turn into years. The world sometimes feels like a stranger to me. What makes life worth it? I wish I could solve the riddle, but I've never been clever.

I'm simply spewing my shit here and I'm sorry for that. But it would be nice to hear something. To know I'm not alone, share what you think or even to help me. Ok cya :^)",18May2020,1

196,"Over the last few years my mental health has been up and down. I believe I have been depressed for probably the last ten years. It found its way to self harm a couple of years ago. I realised what was happening and didn’t want to feel that way anymore. One thing that really provoked this was my then girlfriend breaking up with me because she couldn’t handle someone in that mental space. My mental health started to improve, I went cold turkey on my medication because I didn’t feel it was doing anything. I was getting myself to being ok, still a way from happy but improving. Then the lockdown in the uk hit. I really miss my friends and family, miss doing things I enjoyed and lost things I was looking forward to. Like festivals and gigs etc. I am a key worker so have continued to work throughout, blessing and a curse probably. It’s made me realise how much I need people around me for my health. As if things weren’t difficult enough, said ex told me she loved me again, I told her I love her. She then got with her best friend whilst leading me on thinking there was something between us. 

So ye, life really sucks right now. Not at the point of self harm thankfully but certainly am spiralling. I have referred myself for therapy and contemplating trying medication again. I want to be happy in myself and know my self worth but through past experiences I have been broken down.

197,"I guess I’m just looking to see if anyone else has this same thing going on, or if anyone has any advice. 

I’m starting to realize lately, sometimes I don’t work as hard at something I should I should in order to have an “excuse” if I fail.

Currently I’m in law school, and there’s some “competitive” things to get into certain teams. Right now we’re doing an optional writing competition to get into the law review - which is basically an academic journal, students to editing and writing for it, it’s one of the most prestigious things you can do in law school even if you don’t actually get anything published. It looks good on resumes.

I’ve been procrastinating on it and going back and forth over whether I should even try. I don’t know. I guess I’m doing it because it’s easier to say I didn’t get it because I was just being lazy, but if I had tried I would have gotten it, rather than work really hard and not get it because my best wasn’t good enough.

This isn’t the first time I’ve done this, but it is making me realize it’s a problem. I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, I’m not sure if this is because of that or it’s a separate thing or maybe it’s just that I’m lazy and dumb. I don’t know.",18May2020,1

My grades skyrocketed to As, I feel like not being able to see people has given me more clarity as to who’s worth keeping in my life, and there’s less pressure to be everywhere and do everything.

Other times I’ll punch myself in the stomach as hard as I can or slap my palm against the side of my head, and I’ll blurt out very horrible things/slurs that I would never say normally. 

I don’t know why I act out like this when I’m alone. I understand how ridiculous these actions are, but I can’t seem to stop myself.

202,"I guess that you must see a lot of people who self-diagnose. I know that OCD isn't just washing hands a lot. 

I've always been strange when it comes to meat. It was born from a childhood of frequent food poisoning. If I handle raw meat, I feel contaminated and I have to wash my hands lots of times. If I leave meat out of the fridge for more than fifteen minutes, it is no longer considered safe. I reduced meat intake when I realised that I was wasteful, and that seemed to make things better until I go to my parent's home and I have to eat meat. Same with rice, when they leave leftovers out &gt;15 minutes.

With Covid-19 floating around, I don't feel safe anymore. It started with washing hands a few times. Then, my flatmates decided to go out frequently with friends. I would be scared of contamination and I'd touch doorknobs and light switches with my elbow (like it granted immunity). Or I would have to wash my hands ten or eleven times when cooking a meal in the kitchen just in case. Touch a switch, wash hands. Touch a pan handle, wash hands. Touch a spoon, wash hands. I found myself washing my hands, then using my hands to turn off the faucet, then having to wash my hands again, because the faucet could be contaminated. I would wash them in counts of 4 x 4 in my head. It got so bad that my hands are cracked, bleeding and constantly in pain. Even with moisturizer. I don't know if they'll ever go back to normal. 

I thought that things would change when I moved into a new place where I live alone. But I fear that the inner front doorknob and light switch is contaminated from coming in and out, so every time I touch it, I have to wash my hands, even though I disinfect it each time I come home. I always feel like I didn't clean my hands properly, so I have to wash my hands again.

Quite Great has worked with many, many artists over the years with a range of [mental health issues](https://www.quitegreat.co.uk/music-therapy-support-to-help-musicians-through-stressful-times/), from depression to anxiety to PTSD and PND, no two stories are the same and there is no magic cure. Musicians and artists find themselves under more scrutiny than many – what they look like; how they sound; what their opinions are – this can be challenging for anyone but for someone who may well be alone…possibly even on tour, thousands of miles from home, it can be life-changing and incredibly damaging to their health and well-being.

[Mental Health Awareness Week](https://www.quitegreat.co.uk/blog/quite-great-pr-inspired-by-musicians-attitudes-in-line-with-mental-health-awareness-week-2020/) gives artists the chance to explain what life is like for them year-round – UNDERSTANDING is what is needed – not throwaway comments like “*cheer up*” or “*pull yourself together*”. By listening, we can begin to learn and empathise with what life is like not just for one week of the year but as part of who they are for all their lives. With this year’s theme being ‘***kindness***’, we welcome the chance to not only discuss the stories and issues of so many talented, wonderful people whom were are proud to work with but to celebrate their achievements and to show that with kindness, empathy and tolerance, it is possible to be anything you want to be, not despite your condition but with it simply being a part of the fabric of life.

216,"Hi!

I'm just gonna cut right to the point. Since I was 7 or 8 years old (I am 19 now) I have had another life in my head. These lives have changed, like different names, different people. The life I am living now though, I haven't changed in maybe 4 years. Which is probably the longest time I haven't changed it actually! But that's not the point.

The point is that I spend more time in that life than in my real one. If I am alone, sometimes even if I'm not, all of my conversations, all of my activities, everything I'm doing, I treat it as if it's in that imaginary life. I rarely think as myself. Like actual true myself, not my imaginary identity.

And I'm scared that I will never be able to let go. Also I don't want to let go. I love that life, it gives me comfort, it makes me way happier than I would be without it and for the longest time I thought it was just something weird I did. But maybe a year ago I realized that it might be a bit deeper than that.

So I guess what I'm asking here is, is that a bad thing? Should I try to let go of that life, no matter how happy it makes me? Cause after all, I guess I should focus on my real life more..

I’m not upset, anxious, stressed, happy, motivated, angry, hungry, tired, in pain, bored, etc.

Sometimes I stay in there for a few minutes, sometimes a few hours; I might even switch from bathroom to bathroom to continue my conversations.

At first, I solely used this as a coping mechanism where I would release pent up emotions and revisit some overwhelming events. However, now I talk to myself for more than cathartic reasons. I'll create scenarios or initiate ""debates"" where I imagine multiple people are arguing and expressing different emotions. I'll even take it a step further and pretend to be each individual in the conversation (which would look very odd to an outsider because I'm switching between different ""people""). I'll retell, exaggerate, and make up stories with myself for entertainment; I laugh to myself, argue with myself, etc. 

I'm obsessed with doing this. I've had such insightful discussions with myself that I simply could not replicate with other people. They don't get it, or even try to. Most people aren't that real to me. If I like some qualities of a person, I'll just go in front of a mirror (after interacting with them) and mimic/modify their desirable traits to create my own version of them (something akin to impersonation, but not really). I'm not entirely sure why I do this. Maybe forming several dramatic personas has really eroded my sense of self, maybe reality and its players are just disappointing, I don't really know. 

The worse part is when the conversations begin to die down and I feel myself gaining touch with reality. The lights get really bright and colors get sharper, like reality is taunting me. It's fucking upsetting. I know I'm alone and no one/nothing in my head really exists and there is nothing I can do to make it real because I lack control. I just sit there and stare at the wall because what fucking else am I supposed to do? I can't talk to people in real life about this because they all make that stupid face like ""What's wrong with her?"" so I just go back to the bathroom to correct their reaction in my head.",18May2020,1
220,My family is very much attached to the stigma associated with mental health problems. They are always saying things like people with mental health issues need to “get over themselves.” I am disgusted with these comments as I struggle with extreme anxiety and depression. They don’t take me seriously. I’m not financially independent so I am not sure how to move forward without feeling like the biggest loser ever. Does anyone else have a family like this?

221,"I got out of an psychiatry about a year and a half ago. Ever since I missed it and everything around that time. I got over it mostly, but lately I've been feeling pretty down again. It's not as bad as back then, but I feel like I want to feel this way again. I listen to old music I listened to back then and try to feel even sadder. Sometimes I can't get into songs from then just becouse I'm not in this mindset anymore. I'd love to listen to some emo music and just cry myself out but I just don't feel depressed enough. It's like my Mind trys to reanact these times so badly but just can't. I don't know what to feel. I don't feel depressed or at least not as depressed as back then, but I definitely don't feel happy. Every time I get slightly sad I try to make it even worse. If someone offered me to either be happy for the rest of my life or depressed I'd probably chose to be depressed if asked while I'm in this cycle. I know that these times were nowhere near good or enjoyable but I just miss them so much. I'd probably even go in psychiatry again, not becouse I feel really suicidal but becouse I miss it. I even miss selfharming even though my condition isn't so bad that I'd really need it. Has anyone experienced something similar and has any tips and tricks how to cope this?

224,"in the past few months, i have been experiencing increasingly frequent auditory hallucinations and occasional visual hallucinations. my hallucinations have gone from about one a week to at least one every day or so. my rare visual hallucinations have included the fish from the spongebob intro hanging on a hook in my closet, reciting the theme song, and a bald man in a gray long sleeve shirt and jeans that crouches on my floor and grabs the edge of my bed, whispering in a low voice in a language i can’t understand. the auditory hallucinations are much more frequent, and range from auto mobile noises, to footsteps and a body shifting (often in my ceiling), to laughing and crying, to singing (no lyrics), to non sexual moaning, and sometimes whispering that is too quiet to understand. i often videotape these events and send them to friends, who can’t see or hear what i can. i also watch the videos the next day and can no longer see or hear it. aside from hallucinations, i have developed insomnia. my insomnia makes it impossible for me to fall asleep until at least two am, and regularly causes me to stay awake for days on end (often one to two, but at extremes it can be up to five). it’s become harder for me to focus and i need to write down what i am told to understand complicated things (such as math lessons). my great grandmother developed dementia after having a stroke, and her daughter (my grandmother who is a functioning and working adult) often tells me and other family about how she sees and talks to ghosts often (usually strangers but sometimes her mother and her and her husband’s “guardian angels”.) her daughter (my aunt) tells me she hears voices and can talk to dead people and deities. my grandmother and aunt have not been diagnosed with anything, but i wonder if any of that information could show that i have something hereditary that could be the source of what i’m experiencing. i know i should seek professional help, but i don’t feel comfortable doing that. not to mention how busy all of my local medical centers are with the pandemic.",18May2020,1

The thing is that she has BPD,  I try to be patient and help her any time she needs it, however I’m a person that can get depress (I was diagnosed with high functioning depression years ago) and one of the things that has helped is being alone sometimes, with my thoughts and own space. I love my friend and I want to support her but she sometimes can get really verbally aggressive, intense, and extremely angry in an instant. I’ve gone to the beach with her for 4 days and I’ve experienced it. Of course I try to help her, be compassionate but sometimes I feel emotionally drained, exhausted, and anxious. I don’t think I won’t be able to live with her, specially because we are extremely good friends and if I tell her that I want space she’ll get extremely sad which I don’t want her to.

228,"I don't understand myself very much anymore, throw me a bone someone. I find myself often feeling very manipulative, like somehow I feel like when I talk,I'm somewhat manipulating people into thinking I have good intentions or like I'm a good person.   


A good example of how I often feel manipulative when I speak sometimes would be,  
if I tell someone that ""I'm a bad person"", I'm essentially tricking them into telling me that I'm not a bad person,and by pointing this fact out to them, I have once again manipulated them into thinking that I'm not a bad person and that may become true to them because I've openly told them about my manipulative techniques therefore it is something that they inherently believe in.   


I feel like maybe deep down, I'm manipulative by nature and it is in my nature to twist my words and make the words work for me just so others can view me the way I want them to,making others feel bad, or making others feel pity  for me. I'm no longer sure if this is a thing I'm doing on purpose, or it's just something that I'm doing subconsciously, even as I'm writing this, I feel like I'm tricking my audience into taking pity on me.",18May2020,1

232,"Hi guys. This post is going to be a bit odd probably for most of you but I'm genuinely seeking some answers. It's really difficult for me to get any sort of psychiatric help because I have two parents that are scientologists and absolutely refuse to let me see a psychoanalyst. They'd rather have me go to a church organization called CCHR and basically just dose me with a bunch of vitamins claiming that my anxiety/ depression is caused my vitamin deficiencies. I was very involved with the CoS and it did distract me from my feelings however I have no longer been participating in any church activites and dont know if my depression and anxiety is worse because I'm no longer participating in church activities or if I should really seek help. Which brings me to a question as to how I should go about doing that.. I'm watched practically 24/7 by my parents and it would be extremely difficult for me to just make an appointment with a therapist and or psychiatrist. I was able to do that when I was living with my aunt and uncle and got prescribed cymbalta and propranolol which really helped me out. However when I bring any mental health up with my parents they completely refuse to believe anything is wrong with me. They just like to make claims that ""i was born perfect and would never have anything like that affect me"" or that ""its just simply impossible because nothing is wrong with me and I have everything I need and more"". I was diagnosed awhile back with depression and anxiety. I just dont think they understand that my depression and anxiety is caused my something going on in my brain. I try to tell myself that I can push past negative thoughts and I do utilize a LOT of tech i learned at the church and can definitely confront a lot but I'm still bothered by negative and intrusive thoughts and feelings.  Not to mention the feeling like I'm just always being judged. It truly sucks. I cant really talk about any of this with friends because they all think scientology is completely bizarre and I feel would put the blame on me. I'm sorry if a lot of this is unnecessary.. I just am hitting a point of understanding that I will never get real medical attention to this matter with my parents or family members. How can I go about resolving this? Any help would really be appreciated and I understand that many of you will have negative comments towards the CoS which is completely fine, everybody is entitled to their own beliefs.

TL;DR - I'm generally happy, enjoy personal projects and am content but I have virtually zero productivity at work, I procrastinate nearly the entire day away. What is wrong with me?!

Hey folks,

For the last few months I've noticed that I've been very unproductive whilst working from home and occasionally in the office too. I lack any motivation or drive at work, despite being very aware that I need the financial outcomes to achieve some of my goals... I spend most of the day procrastinating and find it very difficult to motivate myself to do any actual work.

I'm fairly senior at a software startup and before this I worked at a large tech company with what most people would think is an awesome job and a great setup, but I had the same procrastinating issue... It drove me to leave the company and I thought getting involved with a startup might reinvigorate me but it hasn't, perhaps it did for a few weeks but I'm slipping back into being very unproductive. I think lockdown makes it a little worse but that's just because I'm on my own so it's easier to slack off.

The strange thing is that as soon at 5PM hits, or as soon as the weekend comes around, I'm happy as larry - I'm working on woodworking projects, love spending time with my fiancé in lockdown, lots of awesome TV to watch, chatting with friends and family. Otherwise I'd slap a depression diagnosis on this super easily.

The last fourteen years have been particularly hard (has gotten harder with every day that has passed in that time basically), but I’m still functioning, and I’m still here, and most importantly, I’m finally pretty open about it all with myself and my loved ones. 

Said loved ones (my family and friends) are the most amazing, supportive people I could have asked for... which I guess is what makes me feel extra awful for not alway appreciating their comfort.

Essentially, some days when I am in that very dark place, I will share how I’m feeling (useless, worthless, angry, distressingly empty, whatever the issue may be that day) just because I need to say it out loud. I DON’T want comfort. I don’t want to hear I’m not useless or that I have a purpose on Earth. Because in that moment it feels patronizing and no matter how earnest the sentiment is, I don’t believe it. It has never once made me feel better to hear words of encouragement when I’m at my lowest, and that makes me feel like a real asshole.

I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else has these moments and how you reconcile those feelings within yourself?

Throughout my entire university career I have dealt with guilt about previous actions that has, at times, distracted me from being able to live life to the fullest and do good things for myself. I've felt this kind of guilt before on many occasions, and therapy has helped a lot with it. All of a sudden, maybe because of how the world is nowadays (or possibly because I'm graduating) these feelings are all starting to flood back, and I don't know what to do!

Right now, I am thinking back to multiple times in high school when a friend pressured me to tell him information about a quiz that he was about to take (which I had taken earlier that day). I tried to avoid answering the questions, but I'm pretty sure there was at least one time (possibly more) when I couldn't take it and just told my friend the info. Now all of a sudden I feel like I've cheated by giving him an unfair advantage on that test (The way I see it, I basically assisted in cheating.), so as a result I feel super guilty and kind of unable to function. My struggle comes from the possibility that were I to get caught, I **might** be punished in such a way that would ruin my academic standing, which would lead to me not getting to where I am today academically (i.e. being able to attend my current university).

250,"I'm always in my head thinking about anything to the point i dont get things done or am too slow. I am thinking about past mistakes, evaluating decisions, thinking about how to solve my problems, how to prevent future mistakes, or just plain daydreaming. but it happens so much i will just lose so much time randomly and I'm late to everything and miss things and am not as productive as i should be.",18May2020,1
251,"I quit smoking weed and cigarettes last summer, I was clearly self-medicating because after a few months I started to get stuck in obsessive thoughts. 

First one: Woah maybe I gave myself lung cancer!? Googling, googling, googling. It just kept repeating and repeating. Couldn't believe I ever smoked so was beating myself up and made myself extremely depressed.

Second one: Why did I stress so much about getting cancer!? Worrying for weeks that chronic stress can cause cancer and feeling stupid.

Third one: One day I was so miserable that I felt suicidal. I irrationally contacted my ex, I guess because I wanted to have a mature conversation (she's 8 years older). Thought we were cool, but we weren't. She would say something hurtful that isn't true and then block me. I made a new account to argue with that and explain why I'm acting so depressed only to get hit harder with meanest message I've ever read and blocked forever. After that I became so obsessive about that message.. Like it just kept repeating over and over again. I kept thinking constantly of what I wanted to reply. Would send it in instagram DM when I wanted to get it out of my system and instantly delete it again. It would give some relief for like a day, but then it would start to creep up again until I wrote everything down again, only to delete it again. Wasting hours on that shit.. Wtf. It just kept repeating for WEEKS. Pure torture. 

Fourth one: After that I was obviously like 'bruh...' why did you contact your ex? She's over you. You're the one who broke up with her.. Just leave her alone you idiot. I then felt embarrassed and how I'm a freak for doing that. Kept repeating for weeks too.

All these things eventually stopped after I became sooooo extremely bored of it, but it takes like weeks before that happens. That's why I NEVER want to have this happen again. It's ruining so much precious time. I never want to get stuck in a loop again. Lockdown obviously has to do with this. I'm working from home so I have less distractions.. But it keeps repeating even during excercise, eating, when I'm with my girlfriend, watching a movie, while I'm working.. Only when I have to be 100% focused I'll forget about everything for a brief moment.",18May2020,1
252,"I let the smallest things bother me and it’s now impacting my everyday life because it’s literally all I think about. I constantly look into tiny little things like why someone never “liked” my comment or when someone says something mean about someone and then the next minute they literally have their head up the persons ass. Why does things like this bother me? Am I the only one? Its driving me crazy because I know it’s stupid and petty to even care, but I don’t know why I care so bloody damn much.",18May2020,1
253,"Ok so I’m ready to get laughed at, but fuck it I’m on the internet. 

Alright, so basically for like a year now I’ve had this reoccurring thought that I’m like a.. superhero? Or a god, or some supernatural being. It’s so stupid typing it out but it’s the truth. For the past year I’ve somewhat believed this, not completely but I’ve used it as something to fall back on. Like if something bad happened I’d think “Oh this is alright, because in reality I’m a supernatural god waiting to breakthrough.” 

I’ll usually come to my senses but it’s almost like my mind wants me to believe I’m some type of entity when I’m not, like as I’m typing this my head is like “No you are.” It’s stupid, it really is stupid lmao",18May2020,1
254,"I just had a breakdown out of nowhere, I'm on SSRI's and I've been feeling good for almost 5 months or so. But out of nowhere I just had this feeling of anxiety, panic and paranoia all at once that caused a manic breakdown. What is wrong with me? I thought I was getting better.",18May2020,1
