0,"I came here mainly because I have no one to really turn to and talk about this. I doubt that I can even book an appointment and talk to a gp about it either. I don’t really know what I want to come out of me telling you this but I’m just going to throw it out there whilst I’m in the mood of doing so. I’m now 18 and I’ve got diagnosed depression. I believe I have adhd (I’ve had it been brought up as a possibility many times before) and I might even co-morbid with ASPD. Right now I feel like I don’t have a place in the world and I have no clue what I want to do with my life, neither do I really have any plans. I do drugs to keep things interesting or even distract myself from a lot of my thoughts, just to make it easier to act ‘normal’. My whole thinking process is fucked and I don’t feel comfortable wherever I need to adapt, and now I’m loosing the one person who understands me so well.",25Jul2020,1
1,"Sigh, I think I've suffered with depression and anxiety for a long time, despite my efforts trying to get through daily life, its just never enough you know. Ever since quarantine my mental health has deteriorated. Normally, if I had to cry, I'd go into my room vent and cry, then I'd be OK. For a few months now, it has been so debilitating, I'm going through other illness/es (waiting for results) and I just feel like my life has gone to sh*t. One moment I'm alright, the next all it takes is for that one thing to set me off. I went through a phase in February through to April where I wouldn't talk to my family, I'd stay in my room and sob. It was torture. Nobody gave a sh't. My elder eventually ""confronted"" me.

 Recently, I've been having screaming fits where she'd come and calm me down. Idk if its worth mentioning, I've been so fixated on trimming my split ends and picking at my skin. She pointed that out.  My physical health is bad I'd say, I used to have long envious hair, and now it's so thin and dead. My skin used to be amazing, but a few weeks ago I had to call the paramedics bc my face was swollen due to an infection. Physically exhausted all the time. Cant catch a good nights sleep and i wake up late, yet still feel restless. My elder says I'm lazy. And I just dont feel too good. I act like my deteriorating health doesn't phase me, but it very much does. I'm only 20, i want to lead a healthy, content life. Feels like I'm asking for the world. 

Idk how to feel or what to do. Nobody is getting me help or taking anything seriously. I'm so anxious to even speak to the Dr about my piling problems. I feel like it's a nuisance,  I'm slowly dying everyday. I'm ignored by my elders, ive opened up and they've seen me going through it yet they leave it to God, tell me to pray and that it will get better.

Last night, despite her constant nit picking and criticising everything i do, she said something in defence of my paps. He's a narcissist. Later that evening I felt like all the world had lost its beauty, I cried, snot and all. I'm so stressed and held up on my traumatic past. I didn't know what i was doing. Later she came up to me, and shoved me about and raised her hand three times, but didnt go through with smacking me. Then she told me that she regrets ever raising me and that I should go and live with my parents. This has happened many times, she's accused me of drugs, of things that im not even capable of doing. 

Tbh, I think me and my elder deserve so much better, we've been dealt with the bad cards in our lives. People I.e. family members have mistreated me and have gotten away with it in life, no karma for them I guess. I am sick of my life, the constant mental torture and neglect. I want to die but then at the same time I know I have so much to offer and deserve better. I've heard of people getting all the help in the world yet it being of no use.",25Jul2020,1
2,"I’m a 16 year old girl, I don’t smoke or do any delinquent activities, and I’ve never been to therapy or been diagnosed with a mental illness before. My mom has severe OCD though.

For the past 2 years, I feel like like some  people (who I don’t personally know, might be celebrities or people I used to like or just random people in general) are watching me at home when I’m by myself or with my family, and judging me for the most simple actions and tasks and daily necessities: Going to the toilet? Gross. Preparing a meal? You’re doing it the wrong way, haha. Practicing my religious beliefs? Ridiculous (?) Dressing in a certain way? What the hell are you wearing. Taking a selfie? You’re not pretty/you look foolish. Listening to music? Your taste sucks. Reading a certain book (on wattpad)? What are you, 9? They basically ridicule literally everything I do. 
I started doing some some extremely normal stuff in the dark (like going to the toilet with lights off) so that they can’t see me. I’m worried about what they think or that they’re laughing at me to the point that I don’t even enjoy stuff I used to. And I even started talking to myself as if I was making clarifications and justifications to them regarding what I’m doing. 

Also, I don’t think these are exactly hallucinations but I sometimes see shadows with the corner of my eye, but I think it’s just as normal as mistaking a pile of clothes for a ghost. And very recently I smelled a hideous smell twice in two different places. The first time was in my grandma’s house two weeks ago, I’ve smelled it the whole night for no reason. And the second time was two days ago in my house, again for no reason and it was the exact same smell.

Someone suggested I have social anxiety but I don’t act weird around actual people. Only people my brain imagines. I read a lot about it online and I think I either have paranoia or some schizophrenic/schizoïde/schizoaffective disorder. It’s taking over my life and my parents believe everything can be cured by following the path of god or whatever and don’t take my mental health seriously, and I can’t afford therapy myself.",25Jul2020,2
3,So I'm basically stuck between running away and keeping on running forever until I drop dead or suicide. I can't deal with myself at the moment and I want to escape as quickly as possible. Its 1 am and theres no one I can talk to so I don't know what else to do. I can't do this right now and I can't get any sleep either because of this and now I'm gonna be shit at work and I'll probably be a cock and make a complete fuck up that costs me dearly which makes me want to fuck off outta here even faster. I can't get it out of my head and its driving me nuts,25Jul2020,1
5,"Hello, everyone. Im not sure this is the correct place to post this but I'm at a loss right now concerning a close relative of mine. 2 weeks ago, I received a phone call at work saying that this relative of mine had shot themselves in the head in my house. My house was sorrounded in crime scene tape and police squad cars. It took over an hour to find out she was not deceased, and over 24 hours to find out she was actually the one who made the call to 911 post incident. Doctors were amazed that not only did she survive and was conscious and had the alertness to call 911 but that the bullet somehow meraculaously failed to hit any major areas of the brain that caused what they believe to be permanent damage other than permanent blindness in her right eye and a few other comparatively minor issues.

Long story short, she is a psychiatrists dream, schizophrenic, multiple personalities, depression, borderline personality disorder, etc. She has a history of evident self harm, sexual abuse, and other tragic history.

She moved in with me with no identification but with medicaid out of the state of Arizona. We live in Florida. It has been just over 2 weeks since the incident and the case workers at the hospital have been ZERO help in helping get insurance through medicaid or even trying to transfer medicaid from Arizona to here. As such, the hospital is planning on releasing her in the next 24/48 hours and will not give us any information other than ""the doctor deemed her fit to return home."" This is ABSOLUTELY CRAZY NEGLIGENT, AThis person literally has an entire journal of hundereds of pages of evidence in her own handwriting that proves she's not fit for release yet. We want her home but she needs to get help, but I'm afraid without insurance the hospital is brushing her off. We both work full time and are absolutely terrified of leaving her alone, for one not fully recovered and secondly the first and only time she's been left alone attempted to kill herself in our house and very nearly succeeded. (she just moved in 3 days prior).

I am at a total loss, due to covid 19 we are not able to actually be in the hospital to talk and everything is done via phone to no help.

I'm so scared that the hospital is going to release her and she could have another schizophrenic episode and have another attempt on her life. With no insurance we also cannot afford the medications she's being prescribed.

I am in search of some, any advice as to how to get her the help she needs with the hospital refusing to budge on discharge, this is so negligible and feel they might sign her death warrant over insurance. I know",25Jul2020,1
7,"I’m very close to giving up.

I just thought I wanna share my story. 17 and already wanted to kill myself several times. It has been really hard. Born and raised in Southeast Asia I’m just so tired of it. Nothing here fascinates me anymore. I just hate my life so much. My whole life watching movies, films and reading book on what life is like in America has always been so nice. I hate it here. No friends. No parties. Everyone’s so into their own world. And more importantly I don’t even like ANY girls here. Never did. Never seen a girl that could catch my attention for 2 seconds here. Dropped out of college because too stress. My family is muslim and I’m forced to do whatever prayers they tell me to and keep doing it. Fasting etc. I’m just so sick I just don’t believe in Islam. I just want out from my life right now. Everytime I mention my depression to my mom she just laughs it off and acts like it’s a joke. I have been sitting in my room rotting for 6 months just watching videos reminding myself how life is so much better out there. Better yet next year I’m supposed to serve the country because we should all be ‘proud’ for our country. No it’s fucking bullshit. Serve with pride? I don’t want to serve fucking shit. Next 2 years of my life would be me stuck in the goddamn army with no expectation on what to come after that. I really don’t know what to do with my life anymore. Even if I make it past the next 2 years what am I gonna do? I have no college degree whatsoever, no job experience no connections no everything. I just wish I was born into a different family in a different country. It’s a deathwish here. If you don’t study your life’s over. Atleast in America there’s so many opportunities to make your life work out in the end but that’s just in the US. That’s my life right now. Waiting to get enlisted and waste another 2 years of my life serving with ‘pride’ for the country. If I ever make it to 20 years of age, for what it’s worth I hope I make it out to the US one day :)",25Jul2020,2
9,"I have always had a bad temper, but during this quarantine i have notices it get much worse. I don’t really get mad at others or inconveniences, i have always gotten mad at myself. Extremely mad at myself. Usually it’s for not being able to do something correctly or at all, or i become impatient with myself as a whole. i know i’m angry with myself and it’s very clear to others, but i can’t control my tone and what i say to others. i become vindictive towards people close to me that are just trying to help me or are being defensive because i’m very visibly in a awful mood. my girlfriend, who i live with, left today i cannot blame her.  she has told me before that my anger towards my self affects others and i need to fix it (which i agree). i don’t know what i can do to fix it though. what steps can i take. when i’m not being self loathing i don’t feel angry at all. please any suggestions would be helpful, just to get a step towards the right direction.

11,"I honestly don’t know what it is but I’ve never been more depressed in my life since this week and I mean that’s bad. I have chronic illness and pain and I’ve been trying to hold on doing things that make me happy and not worrying about anything else. But today it all started dawning on me how bad this week has been. I have gaps in my memory, I haven’t been eating well at all. I have hallucinations at night and horrible dreams. I know that it will ebb and get better but honestly, I don’t see me not living with everything for the rest of my life. Is that a life?",25Jul2020,1
13,"Ever since I was a little kid, I was never satisfied with my appearance. My family used to call me pretty and what not. Other older adults would say so as well. But never people that were my age. It didn’t help that through out my years in school, I was constantly reminded on how repulsive I am and anything I do, makes people upset or hate me just for existing. Strangers would be rude to me or pretend that I don’t exist by pushing or shoving me away for no reason.

When I was in hs I was an easy target and nothing positive was ever said about me. It was entertaining for them to humiliate and make me feel like shit. I felt like a worthless punching bag. I honestly believe no amount of therapy will help me change my mindset or (obviously) my looks. When you’re constantly being told how unattractive and repulsive you are, no amount of encouragement will save me. Plastic surgery seems like my only better option. Since I’m still young, I still have time to improve. If it doesn’t work out then I know what to do next.

I just wish I could feel comfortable with myself for once and not worry about every little thing I do. It feels so dehumanizing. Constantly looking at myself in the mirror, trying to find what I can fix so I can feel more comfortable in my own skin for once. It caused me to have suicidal thoughts as well since the feedback I get from others just for existing has been negative.

When it comes to dating, I cringe at the thought of anyone actually having some sort of attraction to me too. I’m not used to it. I don’t take things like that seriously. I can’t even see myself being in a relationship at all. It’s like I don’t deserve to be a little bit happy or it’s not gonna last long anyways.",25Jul2020,1
14,"tw self harm

i have been depressed with anxiety and i have severe ocd (according to a test my psychologist gave me) for literally as long as i can remember (i’m 19). i also get social anxiety, inability to focus (but i think this is depression/anxiety rather than ADHD) and i struggle with a lot of childhood and family/friend/relationship trauma. also experienced a loss of a loved one recently. basically it’s getting in the way of my life. it always has for my whole life, but i’m in another low point and this one feels worse than other ones in the past.

i have never been on medication despite being prescribed zoloft by my PCP (who was kinda weird about mental health, like i talked to her about it and she made me take a survey which said i was depressed — what a surprise! — and then she was talking about suicide and insinuated that i’m not “one of those people” and that i probably wouldn’t think that or whatever). being home rn (instead of at college) is so triggering and i started self harming again after like two or three years but this time i actually got scabs and light scarring (but it’s still really surface scratching, when before it would just be like hard scratching or other forms of physical self harm). i’ve been suicidal again but this time a little more seriously thinking about it and getting intrusive thoughts about it. before when i thought about it, i knew i’d never do it but lately i get scared that ill actually do it. like jerk the steering wheel while driving or take the whole bottle of tylenol that’s on my nightstand.

is medication worth it? idk i just don’t want to feel completely numbed by meds (which is what i’ve heard) bc sometimes it’s comforting to just be in my bed crying and listening to music but idk if that’s just me. therapy is so hard, i’ve been going for about 2 years (VERY off and on) and i’m 19. i feel like therapy isn’t working and i know people say to see changes, you have to be consistent and go for a long time. just feeling really hopeless that i’ll never get better because i’m almost 20 and have felt like this for as long as i can remember, and my parents are very triggering and emotionally unsupportive (theyre only financially supportive, which also makes me feel shitty for detesting them so much for gaslighting me and telling me i’m over dramatic and overreacting about mental health).

sorry if this is incoherent, it’s kind of just stream-of-consciousness lol. pls share your stories and journeys with medication. i’m hoping it can provide me with relief so i’m somewhat optimistic, but i’m just really scared. i’m scared to feel different, because i’ve felt this way for almost 20 years",25Jul2020,1

21,"I'm not seeking for a diagnostic on here, but I just wanted to share my concern.

I've been wondering for a while if I do have OCD, or even just some symptoms of it. I've started to notice a lot of intrusive and obsessive thoughts recently. It might not be anything serious, but I'm just concerned.

Some examples I can give are when I moved into my new apartment, I had to find a way to hide a space between the wall and my washing machine. That night, I couldn't fall asleep because all I was thinking about was the measurements required to hide the spacing. I had to get up, mesure it, write it down, and then went to bed. I'm missing a desk and I feel stressed because I feel like my apartment isn't complete, this also includes some walls being empty. I was actually trying to do something, but couldn't properly concentrate because all I could think about was how I need to vacuum my floors, my couch, my rugs... 

Something that isn't new to me is having intrusive thoughts about things I've said or done in the past. I have social anxiety, so any social interactions I've had are embarrassing to me. To feel better, I have to convince myself those events never happened. It keeps me up at night. I've also noticed I've had ""inappropriate thoughts"" for a few years, such as kissing a teacher, friend or family member, hurting people or myself, talking out loud... really weird stuff. I know a lot of people have these thoughts, but with everything else I've noticed, I'm just not sure.

When I was young I displayed more obsessive sequences and acts, such as having an eternal sound sequence in my head that had to end just right, counting, walking a certain number of steps...

But something that's odd is that I'm not a ""neat freak"" (even if that's a stereotype of OCD). I'm quite a messy person, but little things have to be in order. For example, my bed could be undone, my floor dusty and messy, but my clothes HAVE to be arranged by color, my makeup HAS to be arranged by type, my cds HAVE to be organized in alphabetical and chronological order...

Anyways...

Sorry for the long post, I just had to get this out of my head. Thank you for reading.",25Jul2020,2
24,"Help

Hello I’m 18 I need advice I don’t really know what I’m looking for hopefully it helps I guess. ever since a young age I’ve realised something is off with me. I know I have extreme anxiety and anxiety can cause me to overthink things but I swear there is an underlying factor. I’ve been to several psychologists without getting any help and have tried several SRIS which haven’t helped me. When I was younger I witnessed some horrible things between my parents. My mum often would cut herself due to her own mental health issues, my dad on the other hand would abuse my mum severely. I remember a time where my dad was taking steroids and found out my mother had been a prostitute for a brief time before he had met her. He forced a mop in her mouth and beat her with it infront of me. I also witnessed my dad try to hang himself in the garage. Little things like this have severely messed me up especially due to the fact I was always the scapegoat in the situation along with my two other siblings however now they don’t even remember the situation. 

Going to school when I was younger was extremely hard. I remember so much of my childhood it’s bizarre even the first day of kindergarten however briefly remember my teen years. I had many days off of school due to my mum not sending me when I chucked sick days. I’d take weeks and weeks off of school chatting online to people. I could not fit in at school, I often found myself mimicking other peoples behaviour, I felt and still feel to this day that I have no identity. I would often stick to trends such as being emo or hippie because they would make me feel like I had self identity. I feel like there is literally not one person when I’m talking to people, because my voice tone and the way I speak will often change. I also find myself picturing and acting like people’s best friends or close people in their life so they accept me because I feel like there is no me.

I am now in the situation where I’m with a boy I really love I’ve been living with him for 6 months. However I feel like a burden to everyone that crosses me. I can’t talk to people, I feel like such a simple person like I don’t understand how other people can communicate. I want friends however every time I go and hang out with people and it goes sour I feel like I am revealing something to myself that I didn’t know. I’ve started working again however barely show up to shifts because I have no energy and I’m so petrified to be in a social setting because the overthinking gets the best of me and I breakdown. I love my boyfriend dearly but I feel like he doesn’t really understand me deep down like today I told him I was feeling suicidal he doesn’t believe me and I told him to go hang out with his mates because I feel like a burden and I know He’d be sick of being around me because we’re around each other every day. He said yes but the first thing I thought was that he doesn’t care about me because he wouldn’t leave me here suicidal if he genuinely cared about me.

They’re both heavy drug users and I don’t get it, they’re too old to be doing this shit. I’ve caught them snorting pills and I’ve found a crack pipe before. 

A few days ago they got into a argument and started hitting each other so I got in between them and stopped them and my grandpa left us, ever since then I’ve been taking the fallout of it, I’ve been told that I’m a bad person, that I’m disrespectful, and that I use my grandma. All I do is sit in my room and talk to my friends on Xbox or I go out to get away from here. I clean up after myself in the kitchen and whenever I do something that would make a mess and I try to never be disrespectful.

Last September I wanted to move with my mom for my senior year and my grandma started hitting me so I pushed her away and she screamed “he hit me” so my grandpa came in with a bat and I started yelling “I didn’t do shit if you fucking hit me I’ll drop your bitch ass” which I have video proof of, it’s been like this since I was like 10, being threatened, told that how shitty of a person I am, being told that no one else wants me. They’re so manipulative too, they have all my legal papers in a box and my grandma won’t let me have it even though I’m 18 now. 

I know this doesn’t have any real organization but I remember one time I got in trouble in school and sent home and on the ride how my grandpa got in my face and said he’s going to “whoop my ass”, I was like 14.

I went to the hospital in the middle of February, stayed till the end of March. My mind hasn't been at war for months. Until about a week ago.

It started slow. I always crack a joke about me ""craving death,"" like one does when they're around my age. Except this time I think I meant it. So, I stopped making those jokes. Then I started eating less. I thought I just wasn't hungry. Now, thinking back, I probably should've realized what was happening. Except I tend to start overeating when I feel like this.

Now, I'm numb and sad. I don't know how I feel numb and sad at the same time, but I do.

I saw my new psychiatrist a few days ago. I mentioned that I'm starting to feel this way, that my thoughts are getting worse.  I don't have a therapist. I've been looking since the beginning of April.

So, it's back. My bipolar is now biting me in the ass, staying silent for so long that I almost forgotten I have it. With that, it's brought a devastating tidal wave of depression to my shores.

I could see a knife or pills and hallucinate me killing myself that way. My parents have done the equivalent of below the bare minimum here and fiends can only do so much.

I'd like to be sane when I get there. but I cant afford to go to a doctor im completely broke, behind on all my bills, won't have more money until I start my new job in the new city. I have a family history of schizophrenia and I guess I'm just experiencing the inevitable.

I dont know what to do. I just want to be okay. I've come so close to relapsing into self harm and im scared. I cant admit myself into a psych ward because I'd just end up with endless medical debt, if they even let me in.",25Jul2020,1
38,"Hey guys! This is my first time posting here so please forgive me if I'm a little jaunty around the edges. 

To cut a long story short, I've always lived with boyfriends or housemates. I split from my fiance back in October and he's finally moved out after all this time. I'm so excited to finally be free so I can start living my life, however, I have pretty severe anxiety and agoraphobia (I haven't gone out by myself aside from a little shop near me in 6 years). 

I'm feeling really overwhelmed and I know from personal experiences that I don't deal with feeling lonely very well. 

I'm wondering if anyone has any tips or advice for me? 

Note - I do have a dog which I'm so thankful for, I do play video games so I have an active gaming community too. I need more specific help for the times where I do feel alone. 

Thank you in advance ❤",25Jul2020,2

41,"Believe it or not but I would much rather work 55 hour work weeks in retail then to deal with going to college for a higher paying job.  

So I've tried college several times.  I've hated it each time I set foot on the campus.  My parents want me to go to college and to get a higher paying job. They have nagged me like crazy so I just picked a career path at random and went with it.  I really have no interest in the career but I'm doing it anyways to satisfy my parents.  

This last semester, I failed a few classes due to not wanting to do them in the first place.  This means I'll need to retake the class and also, I won't be eligible for a grant anymore.  Now I need to pay for the next semester out of pocket.  Parents don't know that though.  

Now I have been happily working 2 jobs with the dreaded thought in the back of my mind that I'll need to dump all my hard earned money down the toilet just to make my parents happy.  I don't really want to get student loans but if I need to, I will.  

Now that July is nearly over, my parents are on my case more then ever for me to get classes for the fall.

  I wanna just move out and if I see a need for college, then I'll advance to that...but if I don't, I won't go.  The issue with this though is my parents are hell-bent on me getting a wife and family.  So I couldn't provide for the family if I was working 2 basic jobs. I don't want a wife and kids though so I really don't see a point.  But to my parents, it's evil to not want a wife and kids.  Another issue is that I'm 24 and my dad will go ballistic if I tell him what I really wanna do.

The past 6 weeks I've been dealing with a major mental breakdown in which I've had to move back in with my parents due to the severity of it. Im gonns try to describe it the best I can.

Basically, I feel like I know too much, like, metaphysical stuff. Literally every thought, action,  or belief I have or see, I literally cannot help but interpret it through a metaphysical lense that undermines it somehow and it is absolutely debilitating. I feel as though I have seen the ""truth"" of literally everything, every belief system and metaphysical thing in the universe and that i can never operate at base level reality again. 

This is absolutely hellish and im afraid I will be stuck in tjis headspace forever. I'm afraid this is some sort of ""spiritual awakening"" and that im just gonna keep floating upward into this headspace until im completely disconnected from what I used to perceive as reality. 

Has anyone heard of this before? I really need help.",25Jul2020,2

48,"I (21, NB, USA) recently stopped seeing my therapist of about 8 years. It's a long story, but essentially the straw that broke the camels back was when she was acting indifferent to my mom being anti-vaxx. I'm an adult but I'm still under her guardianship bc I'm considered developmentally disabled, so she oversees all my medical decisions. I also have two younger brothers that are still minors, so they don't have much of a say in it either. With the virus and everything, I've been getting increasingly worried about what she'll do if/when there's a vaccine for it, or something similar. When I expressed this concern to my therapist, she dodged a lot of questions I asked her (What should I do? Is this abuse? Etc.) and started talking about how she doesn't want to pick sides bc she ""hasn't done all the research"", implying that she might think my mom is in the right.

We got into a big fight about this and she said that she didn't feel like we'd been making a lot of progress lately. After some more arguing she eventually sent me a list of some of her colleagues who she thought might be a good fit for me. A lot of them seemed kinda off to me, like they'd specialize in some hippy-dippy bullshit like ""yoga therapy"" or something. Aside from them, lot of them give off very similar vibes to my last therapist, which I don't think is a good sign. When I talked to one of my friends about this, she said that I should ignore all the people my old therapist listed and find someone on my own, but that doesn't really make things any easier.

To clarify, this isn't me asking *where* or *how* to find a therapist, I know that part, I'm more so asking what are some things I should be looking out for. Should I be giving these therapists I don't trust a change or should I look for someone myself? When I look for someone, what are some good credentials or experiences have? Bad ones? What kind of things should I prioritize?

My last therapist thinks I need someone who specializes in CBT (or was it DBT? Can't remember), which I agreed with when I was with her but now I'm starting to question everything she said. I'd like someone who maybe specializes in adults since my old therapist met me as a kid and I think at one point specialized in kids? idk. I think it might be helpful to have someone who sees me as an adult, even if I have problems.

I have been extremely unmotivated and spacey lately, I think it's my depression. My mom really wants to find a therapist soon, she doesn't think it's healthy for me to go this long without one. It's been about a month or two since my therapist left me and I want to find a new one ASAP.

One a somewhat related side note: during an episode I texted my old therapist talking about committing myself to a mental hospital. Surprisingly, she thinks this would actually be a good idea, I have no idea if I should trust this and I don't know what the hospital would actually be able to do for me, but is this something I should consider? I'm not harmful towards me or anyone else and it's not like I'd there's anything in the hospital I couldn't just do here. FWIW, I spend five days in an out-patient program in high school and it was some of the best days of my life. I have no idea if it would be different now that I'm an adult, but yeah.

53,"  Does anyone else have anxiety over being fired or generally failing at life? I’ve always considered myself a failure and generally useless. Less than a year ago I was fired from my job. It was pretty out of the blue, I was never written up.When I lost my job, it was rough. My wife and I learned we could not have children and I was the one with the issue. We had constant fights and wondered if we were going to make it. Well I landed a job making 75k a year and have been working at that job for about 5 months. When I first heard the news, my first instinct was to ask my wife to tell anyone, so if I got fired again, I wouldn’t be an embarrassment to the world And I still feel this way. I said to her once “if I get fired again, I might as well get a divorce, because I’ll never live it down”. Recently I have been talked to at work one time in regard to my speed. I have ADHD and a learning disability. So this makes me even more anxious. 

     My anxiety lately has been unbearable and I have panic attacks every day. I can’t stop thinking about work. I try to talk to my wife about it but she doesn’t understand. She says I just need to “take action” and make it so I’m not anxious. I try and tell her that I can’t just stop thinking about things. She stated that if I keep thinking I’m going to get fired, it’s going to happen. Then she calls me a “victim” when I get defense when she says the latter. I’m not really sure what to think anymore, I just feel like walking out of my job some days because it’s so stressful. Im given an incredible amount of work, I have to cover remotely on the weekends and If I don’t finish all my work, I’m expected to finish some at home. Tears are welling up in my eyes most of the day. I don’t know what to do. I’m seeing a therapist but the appointments are every other week and I don’t feel like that is enough. I feel like I’m doomed to get fired from ever job I have and I will never succeed. I don’t know whats wrong with my head. Any advice?",25Jul2020,2

55,"I’m married to my (21F) wife. I’m currently deployed overseas and have been feeling intense depression and anxiety lately. I’ve been projecting it on my wife a little too much by getting jealous easily when she hangs around some guy friends, and I constantly question her feelings for me pertaining to if I’m too difficult to deal with lately and she reminds me that I haven’t been. I also feel left out with my friend group back home. We aren’t doing anything over here, literally just sitting around day-to-day. All I have is my mind, my phone, and my boys here. I’m scared I’m going to project it all into my wife too much one day. I can’t help being so jealous but I have these reoccurring thoughts in my mind that she may find someone more attractive or more better than me. I’ve been showing a lot of insecurities lately as you can see. She’s a great, supportive woman and has never had a history of cheating or anything related. I just hate other guys because I can’t be them. Last weekend she hung out with her single bestfriend and they two went out almsot all night hanging with a group of guys we went to high school with. The whole time I had bad anxiety and I didn’t know what to do with myself. Afterward she FaceTimed me and was wearing one fo the guy’s clothes. Turns out her bestfriend chose to ride with one fo the guys in his car and so my wife let his friend ride in her car (to be nice not to do anything sketchy) where they drove around all night getting food together (all 4 of them) and then the guy riding in my wife’s car have my wife some clothes becuase they all has decided to go look for a pool to swim in. I know this is all harmless. I know women can have guy friends too and go out and it be completely harmless. For me, I took it the wrong way and I lost sleep over it. I played all of these possible scenarios in my head. I didn’t handle it the right way it all and bugged me so bad. I don’t know what to do about this. I have an appointment with a behavioral therapist next week, but still I hate this. That situation bugged me so much because I wanted to be there. I wanted to be the guy in the car. I wanted to experience my wife being all dressed loook good with makeup for a night out. It makes me question myself and if I’m as good a guy as he is. I made myself bring out my insecurities. I just hate that she wore his clothes, he sat in her car, I hate it all because I’m all of the way out here doing nothing while he got the experience with her. 
  To add onto that, I understand she’s out having fun to get her mind off of me being gone a t the moment. I want her to go out and enjoy herself rather than sitting at home being sad because she misses me. I really want to work on this. I know we are young and that we have the advantage of time to work on ourselves while together, but I just want to get over this part now. Im also really hard on myself.

58,"For context I have eczema. I've had it for my entire life, but recently, in the past year, it went from being a nuisance to a major health concern. Originally only my hands were affected; now my hands, arms, legs, neck, and torso are covered with patches of eczema.

I have been to doctors. They give me steriods which work for some time, then slowly lose effectiveness and cause side effects that counter the temporary relief I feel from them. I have taken antihistamines, but they dry out my skin and makes them overly sensitive, to the point of pain. My only hope so far is Duxipent, which appears to work long term without any major side effects. Unfortunately, I cannot be prescribed this medicine as it is expensive and my case of eczema isn't severe enough for my insurance to cover it. (USA) 

I'm always in pain, because my skin is a endless cycle of healing, scratching, and flaring up. It's not horrible, unbearable pain - not enough to take pain killers for, but it's always there. When I shower, the water enters my millions of little tears in my skin, and jt feels like I am showering in acid. When my skin is too dry, I get sparks of pain, all over my patches. Moisturizing my skin when it's super dry also hurts. The constant pain is wearing me down. It's consuming my passion for life, my motivations, my relationships.

I'm so tired. I scratch all the time. I can not control my scratching during a flareup. I'm disgusted by my own skin particles, which I indiscriminately leave everywhere. I scratch both when I am awake and when I sleep, much worse during the night time. Speaking of sleep, I don't remember when the last time I was able to sleep through the entire night without waking up to reapply lotion.

I'm also always afraid now, about what I eat and what I touch. I'm always worrying about if something will cause my skin to worsen. I don't consider myself a person with low self esteem, but I'm also afraid of people seeing my skin.

In addition to all this, is the bitterness...I hate having this condition. I just want to live a normal life, not have to worry about what I do or eat that might make my skin worse. But there's absolutely nothing I can do about it. I just watch my family, my friends, live their best lives, eating and doing whatever they want without a care in a world, and I'm just suffering.

It feels like nothing I do works, all that's left for me to do is accept that I will be in pain, all the time. I don't see a solution for my condition. Sometimes I think to myself I don't want to be alive, or I just want to give up. But what is there waiting for me? What is there to give up? And the answer is nothing.

I don't think I'll kill myself, but these thoughts keep appearing in the back of my mind.",25Jul2020,2

65,"I've had this issue for the better part of 2020, but it hasn't been anything really massive until recently. An idea I had nurtured about a year ago was that somebody was watching me, but it wasn't the feeling of being stalked by just any stranger.

It'd be a person I didn't really know, or, better put, somebody I would want to become friends with. I didn't develop this idea for no reason, though. I developed it with the intent of making it a reason to make myself stray away from doing things that were weird, stupid, or childish. (I'm still in middle school but spend spare time on a Wii playing LEGO games or on my computer on websites like Cool Math Games.) The idea behind it was that if someone I wanted to befriend was sitting next to me watching what I was doing, it'd discourage me from doing things that people'd view as reasons to think I was strange.

I did eventually decide I wanted to drop this idea, because it was stopping me from feeling comfortable doing things I liked to do. During the time I had let this issue grow, my parents had extended their reach of surveillance with, among other things, cameras put up around the household, an app to track my location, and a constant reminder that anything I do can be tracked on the wifi connection even while I used incognito mode on Chrome. (This was a result of attempting to hide from the ""watching"". I'm not proud of it and yet I still do it, since the ability to see what I've searched effectively brings back the old idea that what I'm done is being monitored). I understand the intent behind the setup of supervision is safety, but my head can't seem to do the same.

He went off to college about a year ago and idk what happened up there but now he sleeps like 3 times a week and barely says a word to anyone in our friend group. He's very clearly not ok. I know he has a therapist, and apparently basically everyone in the friend group has tried reaching out to him but he pushes everyone away. I don't think he's suicidal right now. Any advice on how to reach out/ what to do? I can guess that he's got some sort of self worth problems that can be traced back to his home situation but i'm not a therapist, and i don't know how to connect with a person who just pushes everyone away.",25Jul2020,1
74,"My brother is semi famous on Instagram. I’m two years older than him and we went to the same school (I’m going into high school now.) About the time that quarantine started to let up and people started hanging out outside. My brother became friends with all the kids my age. It’s made me pretty upset. The kids he’s friends with were the popular kids, and it has made me feel like I’m not living life. They’re out there, going to the beach, going on dates, sneaking out and such. I feel like I’m missing out, like I’ve missed out all my life. It’s also with some family. I was at a cousins birthday party and all of my family and their friends where sitting around and talking about how famous my brother was. When my brother mentioned how he was going to a restaurant for his birthday, my aunt even said “you should tell them who you are so you could get good seats!” And I was just sitting there thinking “This isn’t life. I have to kill my self” over and over again. Are my problems genuine? If so is there anything  I should try to understand or feel better about my brothers fame?",25Jul2020,2
76,This is my first ever post. I am a 23 year old male living in America. I recently tried to get in contact with two females from my past. My goal was to apologize and maybe answer any questions. Both of them I had some sort of romantic relationship with. At a time in my life I was not doing good mentally or physically. My family was never really well off. I was depressed and suicidal for a lot of my teen years. A lot of that was from a drug addict father. A emotionally distant mother. Drug abuse and emotional abuse. I was a mess. I took it out on the girls I was around.  I was never physically violent but I was in no way a gentleman. I haven't had any sort of response and I think that's upsetting me more than leaving the pain alone. Am I being crazy for wanting a response? Or am I crazy for reaching out to begin with?,25Jul2020,7
77,"I have created a new subreddit r/mentalhealthlaw primarily for people with mental illness/MH diagnoses to talk about the laws and public policies that affect us. I expect people *to be* supportive of one another in this sub, but please recognize it is not a typical support community.

Topic Examples:

-State and federal laws (current and proposed) that affect people with mental illness (positively or negatively)

-Discuss, critique, praise non-profits and interest groups for mental health

-Imagine a better approach to mental health public policy

-Imagine better ways for the mentally ill to be depicted in media, and strategize on how to promote mental health literacy in the media

-Express good and bad experiences with your own issues with laws intersecting with your life such as involuntary holds as a means of putting forth anecdotal evidence on why such laws should be reformed or maintained

I am in the US, but all countries welcome-- I know a lot of other countries are doing a way better job than we are, right now. That input is valuable.

78,"I’ve been starting to get to that age where I realize that life isn’t permanent. A few years ago to most people, my life wouldn’t have been “perfect” but I still had a lot ahead of me and I was very happy. It was the time when you felt like you were invincible, and you thought that everything and everyone more importantly would last. Here’s where things started getting shaky, it started when my grandparents started having more prominent problems  (things like Losing the ability to go up stairs or or the ability to drive longer distances) although these are normal parts of life it made me realize that nothing was permanent. Now when me, a little kid started thinking of what he has today and what could be gone someday, I started having breakdowns usually at night, thinking about losing my own parents. You would think that grief like this would be normal for someone with a loved one that is close to dying, but the thing here was that my grand parents and parents still have time to live. (I mean like at least a decade) you might think “what a hypocrite, he has nothing to worry about” and you are absolutely right but no matter how many times I tell myself I have time to enjoy the company of certain loved ones, I still spend countless hours at night crying and staring at the ceiling.

80,"For some context, I’m a 20 year old male college student. Had a bad/non relationship with my biological father but became really close to an older family friend of mine (he’s in his 40’s) when I was 18 who has played that role in my life since then. I’ll call him D. 

I try not to pathologize my emotional needs, especially those rooted in the desire to be close/connected with people, but I have trouble envisioning a life for myself where D is not a central part. It’s problematic because I don’t want to limit myself/opportunities, but I want to spend as much time as I can with D while he’s alive. I’ve seriously considered not applying to “prestigious” grad schools that are in my reach because they’re far from where D lives. 

I go to college in a different state than D and even though my friends at school and my schoolwork keep me occupied and generally content, there’s an underlying anxiety/sadness that I always feel when D is not around, even though we talk on the phone a few times a week when I’m away. Sometimes I can just ignore it but a lot of times it really gets to me. It concerns me because I feel like I’m too old to be needing this man who is essentially my dad to the extent that I do; I would live with him and hangout with him everyday if I could. I think in some ways because I was deprived of that kind of relationship as a kid my mind is over compensating for it now in my relationship with D. 

Any advice is really appreciated. Should I talk to D about it, and if so, how should I approach it? Thank you for everyone who read everything.",25Jul2020,1

Then I started freaking out even more because I just regrew my eyelashes and I was so happy and now in front of me was all my fucking hair. So I had a panic attack and so I covered my eyes and ears and rocked myself back and forth to calm myself down. as my other self was yelling at me to get my shit together I started praying for my emotional detachment to kick in and then everything got really really loud in my head when all of a sudden it went quiet. Pure blissful silence. No consciousness’ yelling at me. No panic. Nothing.

91,"Hi I am new to this thread but was wondering if any of you out there have advice on how to deal with parents and siblings with personality disorders and addiction. I'm currently a college student and have always known my home life was far from normal but never realized the extentuntil my identical twin sister was expelled from college and admitted to a mental hospital last November for self harm, addiction, and selling drugs. She's always been emotionally unstable and this isn't the first time she's been admitted to a facility, and has been diagnosed with potential Borderline disorder. Since returning from college during Covid after moving far far away, and my sister moving home, I've realized that my mother has started lying more and using very derogatory and hostile language towards both myself and relatives. She frequently lies to my father about using this harmful language, justifies being controlling, and has no regard for boundaries, much like my sister. Multiple relatives have complained and warned me about her damaging behavior. She frequently stalks my location, forgets things, and still bans me from seeing friends whom she feels are independent. She also withholds my financial assets and documents demanding that she have control over my health records since I've been diagnosed with a medical issue that won't allow me to have grandkids. She blames me for stealing her future happiness. I am 20. She punishes me if I tell anyone about the emotional abuse in my household or try to get my sister addiction help.

99,"I have been through my fair share of trauma. From my parents having a horrible divorce at age 5 to my mother getting breast cancer when I was 13 and she almost didn’t make it. Thanks to God she is still with us and healthy! Things were good for a few years but then I married an abusive narcissist who took everything and made me look like a horrible person. We are still in a custody battle for the kids 5 years later with the dumbest small things sending me to court often. As a mother of 4 and having to pay a very large amount of child support every month while having severe ptsd it’s been hard to keep up. My step father abused of me growing up and I still have a lot of anxiety from that, it’s affected me to this day even in my new marriage. I started to get my life together and when I was 24 years old I came home from work to find out my little brother 19 at the time had had a hiking accident. We went to the mountain and looked for him all night. He was gone, he had fell about 300 feet off of a cliff and the border patrol elite team recovered his body with a helicopter. This sent me into a spiral of ptsd and being prescribed sedatives for about 3 years to get through the trauma. That didn’t help because I had to process all of the raw emotions years later and finally understand my best friend was no longer with us. Getting off such a strong medication wasn’t easy either. I have no relationship with my real father. After that I went to a therapist who crossed boundaries and abused of me almost causing a divorce. I’ve had several several suicide attempts since then but here I am. My best friend lost her 3 year old son and I was there when he passed away. A year later one of my childhood friends took his life.

100,"I'm not at all experiencing this at the moment. I'm not in cr\*s\*s, but I feel I've figured something out about the thoughts of harm I sometimes have, and I see it in one of my friends, too.   
Possible trigger, please don't read if you're in a vulnerable place around self harm and related things.   


Sometimes, the thought that I should stop living comes suddenly, comes on strong, and will sometimes even keep recurring throughout a day or few days. About two years ago, I started to notice what causes it, how it works, and how I can sometimes shut off that kind of thinking by taking care of a simple thing: rest.   


After dealing with this for decades, I was surprised when I started to notice that when I'm very tired because I haven't slept, or because I've done a lot of stuff, any new problems that pop up are likely to cause this reaction. If I'm dealing with difficult adult matters, like bills, where to move to, career choices, car repair problems, or relationship problems, and I don't know the right way to handle it, or I keep looking for the answer but not finding it, I will often feel like I wish to stop existing.   


One of my friends has had frequent thoughts about stopping his own struggle, and I've even noticed he goes through the same thing. I could almost set my watch to the idea that if he feels like he doesn't want to keep going, he's having a major life problem that he doesn't know how to solve, or he's exhausted, or both.   


What to do? If it's exhaustion, get some rest, relaxation, and sleep. Remember that sleep is more difficult if you can't relax, so sometimes that has to come first. Don't be angry with yourself, or view it as a failing. Just remind yourself that you're probably tired, and need rest, and give yourself a break.   


If you're having those major life problems and it's causing you to want to think about the solution that isn't a solution, remind yourself that you're stressed and looking for answers, and this is causing you to look for this snap answer. It's okay to not know how to solve this right now, whatever it is. Sometimes, the crisis you're having right now can feel like it's going to envelope you, but you'd be surprised how often you can find other answers if you just put aside trying to problem solve for about 6 to 12 hours, eat, rest, enjoy something entertaining, and think about it again the next day, or better yet, talk it over with someone that cares but isn't stressed the way you are about it.   


Feeling like you have to be an immediate problem solver is putting yourself under way too much pressure. You can be a more effective problem solver without the pressure. Exhaustion should be considered a major enemy of humankind, and especially for anyone with even one extra mental or physical problem in their life. It not only zaps our ability to handle almost everything, it also makes us ill prepared for the next challenge life throws.   


Now, I say this as an absolute hypocrite, because I have a mood disorder, and sometimes I try really hard, and sometimes I succeed, but mostly my rest and sleep are a jumbled mess of me just trying to get by. Still, recognizing this in myself has been a big help. It at least helps me not feed into suicidal thoughts to the point where I'm thinking about it in detail, and helps me switch over to thinking about self care instead.   


I just hope anyone else that suffers from those thoughts can be helped a little by this. Of course, if you're thinking that way, please tell someone that can and will help you with it. This is just a small tip, not a cure, or any kind of alternative treatment. Just know that when you're tired, or stressed, it's not the end, you don't have to figure it out, and you deserve a chance to rest.",25Jul2020,1
101,"I've felt this way ever since I was a kid; going to school or going to hobbies, it just felt like it's just doing those things over and over again and I easily lost interest even though the hobbies were things that I really liked to do.

Especially during depressive episodes, I feel like doing laundry, cleaning or exercising is pointless since you have to do that over and over and over again and it's not a one-time thing.

104,"Since I've been quarantined - about 4 months now, this is the first time I feel helpless. I broke down crying in front of my little sister yesterday. I just can't anymore. I'm in final year of School. I should be studying AT LEAST 4 hours a day, but I can not even study for half. I need good grades, if I don't get them I won't get into a college of my choice and the thought of it breaks me. 

I live in a family of four - my parents, me(17) and sis. My mom was recently diagnosed and is undergoing treatment, so she can't work as much. My dad I and sis do the house hold work. Prior to the lockdown we didn't do any chores. We had house help and the rest was done by mom (cooking) all we did was keeping things at place and stuff. But now since letting anyone in our homes is risky we are trying to manage. Only, I can't. 

A normal day looks like this - I wake up at 6.30 - from 7-8 I teach my younger sister. Then I make breakfast and we have it - 9. My school classes start (online) at 10 and go on till 12 then we have lunch. After lunch, I nap for a while since I'm really tired then I study a bit then I teach a child English from 5-6. Then I get up walk arounf a bit and we dinner around 7-8. Sometimes I help with dinner also - and lunch. Then I study for a bit more time. But it's not enough. 

I should be done with about 70% of my syllabus and I haven't even done 7%. I'm so anxious. So stressed. I don't wanna complain to anyone because everyone is doing their part. They don't sit free either. And if I complain my mom will feel bad and try to do chores herself which is not advisable and I don't want. 

But what can I do? Yesterday we all went to sleep at around 11 and since I felt so anxious I couldn't sleep till 1. I woke up turned on the light and started fo study.  My sister woke up and said turn of the light I said no, let me study. She said let me sleeewp. And we got into an argument. And then I broke down crying. I said I get no time to study I have so much to do. No one seems to care that I'm not doing great at school. People see me studying whenever I can and they think oh she's studying great but it's not enough. I've not done enough. I'm gonna fail and I can't do this anymore. And I cried and cried. 

My mom's health is important. And much more important than my school or grades but I don't wanna disappoint myself. I feel like I'm being selfish but I don't know what to do. I don't wanna stop my teaching session from 5-6 because that's my pocket money job but maybe I'll have to and I love teaching so I don't really know anymore. 

Please please don't tell me that grades aren't important and won't matter in a few years. I know. But they matter to me now.",25Jul2020,1
105,"I was taking quetiapine er 400 mg, technically known as the happy pill. I told my doctor about my overwhelming lack of being able to give a shit about anything (friends, family, all of those emotions were lost on me), as well as focus and paranoia.

Now I'm taking a little bit if abilify, qutiapine (regular) and some lamotrigine. It's only been 2 days. I'm a firm believer in waiting for a couple of days to see if it has a positive effect. 

So far, I was hit with an overwhelming depression. Overwhelming. Like someone was using my chest like a trampoline. Afterwards, I had hot flashes, I became hyper aware of my breath. It felt as if each breath was a challenge, and I had to physically move my chest, and the pressure of being hyper aware...more or less, my anxiety was going haywire.

As of now, I gave in and tried the quetiapine er again, because I was desperate and felt like a dying man starving for water. 

There was a time with my first psychiatrist, where he gave me a medicine to begin to treat my bipolar. I had a severe anxiety attack for a whole 2 days. It felt like a very creative form of torture, one the devil is fond of. I honest to God thought that I was dying, and I almost wished for it because the pain would never stop. Afterwards, I was exhausted for 3 days, and doing anything would require taking a breath in between.

I experienced something like that this night. Hyper aware of chest. The only difference is I have prior knowledge about how this first felt. I know that it feels like I'm going to die, but I won't. sometimes people get anxious over the idea of having an anxiety attack. I told myself ""c'mon anxiety, hit me. Let's get this over with, hit me"" and that really helps with the anxiety. If you just accept the fact you're going to have an anxiety attack, ironically enough, it'll help.

Distractions aside, should I make an appointment with my doctor soon? I've seen him 3 days ago, and I should give the medicine minimum a week before I quit. I also found that it helps me immensely with my cognitive skills, since I'm able to write about this so well.",25Jul2020,1

109,"I’ll spare the gory details, but suffice it to say that my middle school years (6th-8th grade, ages 11-13) were absolute horseshit. I had never been popular in school, but this was a whole new level. I was teased to my face, gossiped about behind my back, cyberbullied, and physically abused by my classmates. School administration, of course, was about as useless as you’d expect. 

Naturally, this fucked me up. By the time I was 12 I had to be put on antidepressants, which are still part of my daily medication regimen to this day (as I’m about to turn 23). I believe that every mental health problem that I have to this day can be traced back in some way or another to the way I was treated by my peers during my formative years. I have major depressive disorder, borderline personality disorder, and severe problems with both general and social anxiety, all of which I believe have roots in my middle school days. 

As much as I would love to be over everything after all of this time, I’m not sure I ever will be. It’s infuriating knowing that they likely have no idea what they did to me long-term and haven’t thought about me in a decade, even though the mental health problems stemming from their actions have impacted my adult life from every angle. Even to this day, I have recurring dreams about my biggest bullies. Logically,  I know that they all were just kids like I was and may be totally different people as adults, but I can’t help still being angry after all this time.

114,"Hey I just wanna start off by saying that I know I’m entitled to my feelings, but I would like some other perspectives on this before I bring the issue up with my friend. Also English isn’t my first language.

I’ve been friends with this person for a few years, and we’ve definitely had some fights. I feel like I’ve moved past it after we’ve talked and apologized for our mistakes, but I feel like she has some sort of resentment. This is just a theory and might not even be related to this issue. Our last fight was months ago now though and still it seems like she’s making less and less of an effort in the friendship.

We’re both struggling with our mental health, and lately when I open up to her she isn’t supportive at all, doesn’t show any empathy, she doesn’t seem interested when I tell her anything regardless of it being serious or just something random. Usually when I tell her about something she replies with “hahaha” “same” “mood” and she never asks questions to take the conversation further. 

The reason why I need some opinions is because I isolated myself due to drug abuse and depression/anxiety through my teen years, I didn’t attend school a lot, and I’m kind of insecure that I haven’t fully developed my social skills. I was also neglected as a kid and because of that I think I struggle a lot with forming healthy/loving bonds with people. Am I expecting too much? Is this all in my head? I just feel like friendships should be more than this and I’m unsure if the friendship is even giving me anything other than someone to party with. She’s the only friend I have left because I got sober and drifted away from the people I used to do drugs with, so I don’t have anyone to “compare” with. Is this really what friendships are supposed to be like? I feel like I’m really making an effort but I’m not getting much back.

I have considered the fact that she might be like this because of her mental issues but it hurts me being treated like this, and I’m seriously considering distancing myself a bit because I feel so much worse every time she “rejects” me. Is that fair or am I being an asshole for even considering that?",25Jul2020,1

I need some advice. Before that, here’s a little background info: My parents are pretty normal people, i think. When i was small, my parents used to fight a lot, swearing at each other, and sometimes they would turn violent too. My father has been using curse words as far as i can remember, i don’t think he ever tried to not swear in front of me, even when i was a child. So it became pretty normal for the three of us to just swear and curse, sometimes i even cursed at them out of rage, and they’ve never failed to verbally abuse me, as far as i can remember. But as i grew up, (im 17 now), i realised that families don’t normally function like that. Mothers don’t insult their kids like that, mothers normally don’t pass snide comments about their kids and insult them in front of their friends to this extent. 
They’re physically affectionate towards me, they hug me and i know that they love me, but their unpredictable behaviour has caused me several mental breakdowns and enumerable anxiety attacks. 
I need some advice on how to stop seeking their validation, and how to start dissociating myself from them? Again, i’m only 17 so we live in the same house.",25Jul2020,2
116,"\*accidentally SUPER long post + kind of bad grammar sorry lol\*

In a very ""brief"" summary for context: my parents got divorced when I was very young and my dad was absent at least and verbally abusive at most. I lived with both of them half-time until the abuse got too much and I started showing signs of unhealthy coping skills in elementary. Realizing the effects of my dad's words and actions on me, my mom began fighting for full custody. Inevitably, she won, so I started staying with her full time.

I've blocked out many things from my childhood and adolescence, but some things have definitely stuck with me. Because of the way my dad treated me, I viewed him as a ""monster"" in the house (which sounds kind of dramatic). He would constantly shout and swear, go through my personal belongings and phone for dirt on my mom, and just not be the ""father figure"" I expected him to be. Naturally, if anyone was acting like this toward me, I wouldn't like him. And I didn't. So I turned to my mom. I viewed her as my savior, counting down the days until I got to go to her house and escape my dad's. In addition, she would constantly talk bad about my dad and how horrible she made her life which only added fuel to my burning hatred toward him.

So of course, when she won full custody over me, I was beyond relieved.

But over these years, I've come to reflect on a lot of things.

I'm not sure if she's always been like *this* because I viewed her in such a possible light when I was young. I realized that instead of her being good to the bad, she was just of the lesser evils. Yeah, my dad's treatment towards me wasn't great, but in a way, she's worse. At least he admits what he's doing is wrong. But my mom has never taken accountability. Ever. She constantly pulls the ""I had mental health issues before you"" ""your dad was worse"" ""do you want to back with your dad?"" ""you act like your dad"" ""you make my life miserable"" and the ""you make me want to kill myself"" cards on me constantly, nearly 24/7.

At this point, I don't know what to do. I've given up on having any relationship with her. She screams at me, throws insults, and guilts me one second. But by the next hour, she's acting as if nothing has happened. Does she know how much this affects me? She tells me I have issues, but does she ever stop and wonder why? Is she really that unaware or does she just not care? I tell my therapist this, and she's insistent on me building a relationship with my mom. But as cliche as this sounds, nobody understands, not even my own therapist. I don't want a relationship because I've tried and tried over how many years now? And every single attempt has either left me suicidal, in the hospital, relapsing, or her just not talking me for weeks upon weeks. It's annoying that we're getting nowhere, and I'm sick of this. I don't want anything to do with her.

Maybe I'm contradicting myself when I say this, but I don't hate her. I just hate how much I've made her hate herself. And I hate that I've done things that made her hate me. I hate myself. I want her to cut me off. I want her to ignore me forever and forget she's ever had a child. I want her to enjoy the rest of her life without me. And I tell my therapist, but then she gets concerned that I'm suicidal. I'm not. I just want to disappear, not die (though it's kind of the same thing). I don't want to be here, making her life that much more ""miserable"" as she puts it.

I have absolutely no idea what a ""family"" looks like. I did go over to my friend's house for dinner one time, and it was crazy. They were all having dinner and actually talking and sitting next to each other. Even if they were on their phones, they were still in the room. That's when I realized that my version of a ""happy and healthy"" family was anything but. I thought it was normal to dart in your room and close the door as softly as possible once you hear the front door open. Or memorize the number of footsteps it takes for her to get around the house to the point where you know where somewhere will be based on the sound alone. 

Though my mom and I are still in the same house, I feel like I haven't talked to her in weeks. She doesn't actively ignore me, but we just don't talk. Our relationship is nonexistent. What even is a mother-daughter relationship? I genuinely thought those didn't exist. At first, I thought my relationship with my mom was fine as if her words and behavior are fine because ""my dad's said worse"" and ""at least she doesn't make me sleep outside. Or better yet, ""I should appreciate everything's she done for me."" I really cannot think of what's she done for me besides the basic requirements of a parent. Yes, she cooks meals and pays for stuff and cleans around the house, and I do thank her for that. But that's basically it. Like, w*ooow* thank you so much for doing the bare minimum of the role you chose as ""mother.""

Genuine question: to what extent is the excuse ""it was in the heat of the moment"" okay? My mom tells me to go kill myself or else she will in the ""heat of the moment"" and then acts fine later. So is that excusable? I don't even know anymore.

Another genuine question for anyone out there: am I overreacting? Is she really that bad? It's not abuse, but is it really just being strict? Should I just... suck it up? Anyways.

I feel like she hates me so damn much that she wishes for me to die by her own hands. And as twisted and sick as this will sound: I want to. It's a sick death wish in my messed up mind that I want her to kill me with her own hands if it'll make her feel better and relieve some of that anger I've caused. I want her to end my life in the most torturous and painful methods known to man. I don't want revenge. I want her to be happy. And if being happy for her means a life without me then so be it.",25Jul2020,1
118,"Hey r/mentalhealth
Im a 17 year old kid, and lately I have these huge moodswings where I cant be anything but sad and can only focus on the negitive stuff, if I try enough I can let it go. I read some stuff about bipolar people lately (relating to the kanye west stuff) and I dont know if Im just linking it for no reason or if I actaully should seek help. 

The negitive stuff I focus on in these moodswings is mostly about stuff like past relationships, jelousy of friends and even jokes made about me. But I also have these positive mood swings where I feel f*cking great like I can take on the world, can get every woman, can go trough any struggle.

Theres arent really much mental health issues in my family, only my grandma, she has a form of depression (i forgot wich one, but it also has to do with ups and downs, but she isnt bipolar i believe)

So in short: I feel bipolar should i get help or am i overreacting

119,"Firstly if i’m on the wrong reddit forum someone redirect me to a more suitable one if possible please.

To begin, i will try keep this short. Some background. My dad is 58 yrs old, left his country and family at 17 yrs old in order to seek a better life.
For the past 4-5 years my dads been living alone back home due to being deported for a minor incident that happened where we live. 

My dad has suffered quite a lot growing up, he left a war torn country and he’s been prison a few times, for mostly 1-2 years at a time. 
Once in his 30s and once in the 2014 for 2 years (i was 16). When he was 17 before he escaped the war torn country he was also beat up badly by Serbian Police in Kosovo. He has a few scars around his head and they broke his jaw where he had to eat/drink threw a straw for months. 
He’s also struggled quite a lot throughout life with other things. My dad is old fashioned so he doesn’t like going to a psychiatrist or a doctor for help.

Now trying to help diagnose, and help my dad. 
Firstly I’m certain he has ADHD as he litterly has all the symptoms of it. 
My dad is very short tempered also gets angry and has mood swings where he can’t control himself. He also can’t stay in a single place without doing something for a long time.

Another thing i’ve noticed recently he’s started to become like a teenager. To help understand , i’m not sure if this a disorder or something. But he likes to do things that teenagers would do. My mum often says to me it’s almost he’s a kid because of the way he thinks and does some stuff. I also agree. Does anyone know if anything like this exists? Or does anyone need me to go into further explanations.  

I’ve also noticed a few other things such as hesitates a lot around police and is often afraid and hesitant when they ask him questions. Even though we’re not in the wrong and doing nothing wrong.

Does anyone have any other questions/tests? or anything which could help me diagnose what other issues my dad could have so i could recall and see if i remember anything. I would like to get him treatment or self educate me and my family to help be more careful around my dad. 

Thank you!",25Jul2020,1

Was hoping anyone could offer any advice if possible.

Family estrangement has turned me into a shell of who I once was. I am very introverted as well and as such tend to keep to myself and have only a few good friends and a boyfriend. However, since the breakdown between my family and I a year ago, I have lost all interest in socialising.

I’ve become a very sad and anxious person since I my relationship with my parents fell apart. It’s really destroyed me, especially the extremely obvious and unhealthy favouritism for my sister and I’ve got to a point where I feel so worthless and just expect my friends and boyfriends to dump me eventually because my own family did.

I feel so alone because no one I know understands family estrangement and I feel so worthless and don’t want to drive anyone away with my problems.

I feel lost, tired, uninterested in things(depressed) .

 Some history, usually very outgoing, popular with people but seem to be losing a grip on that while I lose myself, I lost my father a year ago, had a toxic relationship which seems to be coming back, I have access to cbt therapy and I do take antidepressants...

152,"Hi there,

I'm 18 and I have a question about possible overeactive imagination. I'd say I'm a very creative guy and I draw a lot. I daydream a lot and sometimes get so caught up in them I murmur what I'm thinking. Eg: ""So your excited to go to university?"" ""Yeah I am"". Pretty strange example. Sorry that's all I could come up with from the top of my head.

I also really like video games so I often have fantasys about characters within in them doing cool stuff or sometimes even an interpretation of myself doing something cool.

None of this sounds harmless and in my head it doesn't seem so bad. However what worries me is when it effects my mood. I had something terrible happen to me a few years ago (which I would rather not discuss here) which I often revisit in my imagination and it becomes a sort of nightmare in my head. I then often question whether what happened was my fault and often think I'm a terrible unstable person. 

To counteract how that hurts me I often daydream about someone who knows and cares about my situation and sort of have a talk to myself to calm myself down.

If this would be any help at any hypothesis. I fell down the stairs as a child. When I was born I almost died and was starved of oxygen as a baby. At primary school my parents were told I could have brain damage but nothing came from it. 

I'm sorry if all of this is very vague I'm trying to pin point certain things but I'm afraid this is all I can really think of. If anyone has any Idea if I have a condition or something I'd be glad to know. If not does anyone have any ideas on how I could nul my imagination so it doesn't become a hassle.",25Jul2020,1

155,"I'm 23/F, and I'm only having nightmares. They usually get worse when I'm stressed.

It's not the fact that I have nightmares that worries me though, it's the fact that they are terrifying. Like, unbelievably terrifying!
I dream about things that I could never in one million years could come up with when awake. I also don't watch any horror movies, nor do I like stuff like that. I'm a real pushover, and far away from anything scary for that exact reason.

My nightmares are so bad, that I wake up dripping in sweat, with a fast heart-beat and heavy breath (this sounds so cliche, I know). I always end up thinking ""How did I come up with this?"" 

A lot of times, I also wake up too fast, so I'm in this half-awake/half-asleep state, where I can't move and see stuff, and feel as if something is sitting on my chest, which only scares me more (I live alone, so I know I'm just imagining things).

157,"&gt;In this episode, Max and Harriet talk about how neoliberalism paved the way toward our epidemic of mass loneliness and why dating now resembles a short term, extractive, free market activity wherein alienated singles try to connect through a market medium to secure a basic human need: love. The new norm is that everyone is expected to perform in a place called ""online"" portraying themselves as a special, eye-catching brand, to maximize attraction to consumers (dates) within a particular niche market (potential matches within monetized software on phones built with  hyper-exploited third world labor).  We argue the precarity of housing, jobs, and healthcare has created a kind of ""trickle down economics"" effect so that even sex, love, and intimacy have transformed into increasingly precarious, scarce commodities. Harriet speaks on how lovers used to meet through living in the same neighborhood, attending the same school or church or bowling alley, and could vet each other within their overlapping circles because people knew each other for a long time. We urge our loneliest and most despairing listeners to fall in love with ""the movement"" in some way, and to keep searching for meaningful connections however they can so they don't feel so alone within an economy that sees them primarily as a source of cheap labor.

158,"The idea of participating in group therapy activities can be daunting – especially for individuals suffering from myriad mental health problems. Group therapy is led by psychologists, so rest assured, it is invigilated by a professional and activities and individuals are monitored and taken care of closely. [Group therapy activities](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/) are mainly aimed at providing support, providing a firm sounding board for individuals and promoting positive coping skills that can make dealing with a mental health problem easier – for both the patient as well as those around them. There are several benefits of group therapy activities, especially for coping with depression. Read on to know more. 

**Benefits of Group Therapy for Depression**

1. **Sounding board -** When you have a problem, you may not be able to look at it objectively, without an emotional bias. However, members of a support group can. Sharing problems within a group can play the role of a sounding board as they may help you look at things differently, from a better perspective and deal with your problems better than you would have by yourself. 

2. **Support -** [Group therapy for depression](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/) can help you see that you are not suffering alone. Group therapy not only reassures you that there are several other individuals who face similar problems as you but also allows you to share your thoughts and feelings with them with a sense of reassurance that they understand you exactly the way you wish to be understood. 

3. **Helps you move forward -** When you see your peers at group therapy overcome their problems and live a happier life, you feel motivated to be in the same place as them. This catapults you into motivation to do better, be happier and overcome your problems too so that you can live peacefully and happily. Hence, groups play an important role in helping you move forward and push yourself towards healing. 

4. **Social skills -** Depression can make you feel anti-social and may suck the social skills out of you too. Group therapy can help you re-engage with individuals in a safe environment where you can choose to socialize as per your own will. Participating in group activities can help you get along with others and see that socializing is not that bad. 

5. **Group therapy is cheaper -** Individuals who aren’t very far along in terms of their mental illness can opt for group therapy instead of individual therapy. Group therapy may have the same effect as individual therapy in the context of recovery when the illness is still scratching the surface and is, of course, much cheaper. 

6. **Group therapy can be enlightening -** If you ever feel like you need to introspect in the presence of a trained professional, don’t hesitate to consider [depression counselling in Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/). Group therapy can help you learn a lot about yourself through the eyes of others. They can give you an unbiased opinion about yourself which is positive, supportive and encouraging and can help you overcome your problems by clearing the path of your conscience.",25Jul2020,1

I’ve been really trying to get a car, get my license, and move out. This sweet offer came to me about moving into a place and I thought I’d be ready.

It really hurts to see all of the wheels set in place and then it come back to be a lose-lose situation but hopefully someday I’ll be back on my two feet. I’m seconds away from having a license and I’m still proud of myself and not completely defeated from the situation but there’s time to bounce back.

I normally hear my name being shouted or just gibberish which I cannot make out.

However, last night I very had a very real-feeling experience of believing that there were a pack of coyotes in my garden (note: I am in the UK so there are no coyotes). The noise was choatic and the barking and screeching was very distinct. I was fully convinved that they were there for me. I was particularly worried about my poor dog because I thought they would attack her (my priority is not myself lol).

I snapped out of it immediately when I sat up.

This was a completely different experience to what I am used to because it was a new type of noise, which was very real-feeling and I also believed it was real.

166,"I’ve been seriously thinking about hurting myself for attention

I (17) honestly don’t know anymore. I’ve thought about hurting myself to get attention from my friends.

But lately, it’s been almost hoping I get in a car accident so my friends will visit me in the hospital and think about how much I mean to them. I haven’t done anything stupid while driving, but I’ve hoped that someone would hit me. I’ve also thought about how much attention I would get if I started cutting or took a bunch of pills. I don’t think I want to die.

167,"Hi everybody I wanted ask something that is somewhat related to my existential/pure o ocd. I don't know if this is exactly the right place to ask this because it's sort of a theoretical or philosophical question, but it does relate to my ocd. I can't articulate why it relates, but knowing the answer to this rather fundamental question about the nature of our own imaginations could help me a great deal in fighting this. I also want to say I know this is quite irrational to be obsessive about, but it has been quite persistent in my mind. Also sorry if it takes a while to get to my question, but I want to make sure I convey it correctly.

So my question relates to imagined worlds or stories in our thoughts. I have read up on this concept known as the Death of the Author recently and it makes a lot of sense to me. Basically the theory suggests that when an author or artist creates a story through text or whatever they are actually creating sort of a template for the consumer to interpret and create their on story out of it. And the original author's vision of the story is just one interpretation of the text/image/etc. Of course I feel an author's influence will persist through the work because for example when I read lord of the rings and you read lord of the rings we can both probably agree it's not about cats playing with yarn or pigs flying. We use the context in the writing to come to similar conclusions, but the ""image"" of the story in our minds are likely somewhat different.

So my question is this. And mind you it may be a dumb question. Do these stories already exist and we are just interpreting our thoughts from them? Or are they created from our thoughts? Like when I have a thought of someone playing basketball, did the story that the thought tell already exist or was it spawned with the thought? I know the concept of the story already exists just like how the concept of any story or possibility exists, but I dont know if the actual story itself already exists and my thought is just telling it or if the thought actually creates it. I'm sorry if I'm not properly articulating this question in a way that makes sense. And sorry if this is the wrong sub to ask such a question, but it could really help me understand my thoughts to do something about them",25Jul2020,1

Recently I’ve been skipping meals again, I blame it on my recent breakup but really it’s the fear of gaining weight. I used to self harm for years, but Mum and Dad never questioned why I was wearing a hoodie in July and why are my arms and hips still full of scars. I used to steel alcohol from my parents and drink a lot when I was 15 but somehow Mom didn’t notice her missing wine and Dad didn’t notice his missing rum. When I was 15 told Mom that sometimes I smoke weed and she went fucking crazy about it telling me how it will ruin my life and still threatens to tell my dad when we have a fight. I cried my eyes out before going to high school because I was convinced that I’m a lot more stupid and useless than anyone else in this world and I will fail. When I was 16 Dad told me several times he’ll kick me out the day I turn 18. Again, he convinced me about being an useless little piece of shit again and I started cutting again. I wanted to take my life so many times over the course of the last four years. Mom and Dad never even had a clue. I met my ex boyfriend on Tinder when I was 16 and Mom and Dad think he was my first time but no, my first time was a hookup also from Tinder. Mom used to tell me how proud she was because I wasn’t like the girls my age. I never went to parties and got wasted. Little did Mom know that the only reason for that was my social anxiety and panic attacks that didn’t let me make friends in the firts year of high school. Instead I got wasted alone when I was sad and wanted to numb my feelings. Mom and Dad always called me a lazy pig when I got bad grades at school but Mom and Dad didn’t know that I didn’t study for the test because I spent the night crying after Dad called me a bitch and Mom hit me. Mom and Dad never realise when they fuck something up. Mom and Dad are raising my little sister the same way they raised me and they blame her for calling them stupid and telling them she hates them. Last weekend I came home and told them I was at a party and puked 5 times because I was way too drunk and Mom and Dad just laughed with me but I was too scared to tell them I smoked weed too. Mom and Dad always fight when the other one yells at the kids but they both just it anyway. Mom and Dad are really mad when my little sister gets aggressive but they never thought beating us up from the age of four was wrong in any way. Mom used to take my phone and smash it and think it would solve my bad grades at school, but not being able to text my friends after our fights just made everything so much worse. Now Mom can’t slap me or take my phone anymore because I would do the same thing to her. When I bring any of this up Mom and Dad deny it and start yelling at me.

180,"Context: Okay, so recently, my mom got divorced from my stepdad after, even though she took care of him and physically risked loosing her job as a lawyer to help him when he had a stroke, he claimed he was “abused” by her because he sometimes didn’t get his way. I was more than thrilled to see him go (he hasn’t left the house yet, we have to wait until he’s fully able to take care of himself and have a proper income). I’ve been thinking about the shit he did to me when I was young, and how much it fucked me up. I know he did have a kind of messed up relationship with his father (his dad was a drinker from what I’ve overheard) and his mom would vent to him instead of discussing it with her husband, but I don’t think that makes what he did to me and my older sister valid.

When I was very young, whenever he got really upset, he would yell, and I mean yell, into my face. He’d go right up to me and yell at me. This was a kinda normal occurrence up until my uncle died (and I was about 10 when that happened), and then I guess it just kinda stopped. He would still raise his voice at me, but he wouldn’t get in my face anymore.

I remember this vividly, and it kinda ties into the whole ‘yelling at my face’ thing. When I showed a bit too much attitude, either towards him or my mother, he would stand up and walk towards me with a look of just anger. I remember running around the house, crying and yelling that I was sorry because I was worried he would hurt me (physically, he hurt me emotionally many times). He would eventually grab me, and yell at my face more. I remember being horrified for my life, because I was so much smaller than him, and he was stronger than me by a lot. I genuinely thought he was going to beat me.

I remember once he and my sister were in an argument about something, and he raised what I think was an iPad above his head like he was going to hit her. He hadn’t done that before, or since that point.

I could never do my homework with him. I have a tendency to get stressed out quickly, and get upset. He’d raise his voice and get pissy at me whenever I didn’t understand the assignment and got upset due to that. It made me avoid asking him for help, even though I was doing poorly in school.

I remember that for quite a bit, he wouldn’t knock on my door before entering my room. He’d just barge right in, often while I was changing. It happened enough times that even though it’s been years since he last did that, I still don’t feel comfortable changing in my room.

When I was young, he’d drive through neighborhoods with my sister, my cousin, and I going faster, and taking sharp turns to the point where (I think) you could hear the tires rub against the road. My sister and cousin loved it, but me? I was terrified. Yet he did it often enough to whereShall I once again specify that this was happening by houses, full of families, and that if that car where to bang into something, it would be incredible likely that the children in that car would be hurt? Because he still did that, and I don’t doubt he knew what the consequences would be if he fucked up. 

When he’d pick me up from school, he’d often be on his phone, texting god-knows-who (it wasn’t my mom, that’s for damn sure), and drive pretty fast on the road. I was scared that something would happen, that he’d crash into someone, and I’d fucking die. Two times I remember asking him to not do that. The first time, he had been a bit sick that day, so he complied and even apologized. The second time? The turned to me a yelled “I don’t give a fuck if you’re scared, (name)! I don’t give a fuck!”. At some point, he did pull over and text somebody for what felt like 20-30 mins before finally taking me home.

And the most recent incident happened a few months ago. My mom had gotten somebody to fix my sister closet door (which is also a mirror btw) and my stepdad told her that the guy working on the door was sick. Then, he began to basically say “him being sick if your fault” even though my mom couldn’t have any way of knowing he would be sick, and when I tried to point this out he turned to me and yelled “shut your mouth! Shut your mouth!” causing my sister to have an anxiety attack. When my mom told him how fucked up that was, he said “she shouldn’t have spoken about it, it’s not her place”. He did apologize later, but I didn’t forgive him.

Last thing, he did cheat on my mom at one point. Apparently, it was because he “still wanted to know if he was attractive” (at some point I overheard an argument between them where he expressed that he stopped asking my mom for sex because she didn’t want to have sex, so that might be the case instead). To this day I still think he’s a fucking bastard for doing that.

Tldr: ex-stepdad marries a woman with two kids, knowing that he doesn’t know how to handle kids, much less two girls with a rivalry, and then just goes with whatever his emotions tell him to do.

When my stepdad was in the hospital (because of the stroke), I fully realized that a truly hated him. My mom and sister both thought it was because I hadn’t taken my medication in some time (my pill bottles were empty and my mom couldn’t refill them) and I was just talking out of emotion. I thought that for a bit, but, when I finally opened up about it to a friend, I finally realized that I had a reason to hate him, and I’m happy that he’s not even considered my family anymore.

But I’m wondering: does this count as abuse? He never hit me physically, never talked me down and tried to hurt me emotionally, and never, ever tried to do anything sexual with me. Is it abuse, or am I just overthinking things? Also, should I post this to r/insaneparents if it’s better suited there?",25Jul2020,1

183,"Hey.

After reading a post about ""The inner critic"" by The School of Life on youtube I realized my troubles with my own inner critic is such an integral part of my life that I sometimes don't even notice it going on.

I genuinely feel like if I don't become one of the most genius composers in the history of music, or make some of the most genius music ever created, that I'll be falling short of what I expect of myself. (For additional info I studied composition at university, so it's something I've been doing as a big part of my life for a long time). I know it's suuper fucked up and very grandios to hold myself to such high standards, and I'm quite ashamed of it (hence the throw-away account), but it's been my reality for so many years, and it kind of evolved all the way from childhood. I've always derived my sense of self from being ""the best at something"", and it has kind of snowballed into this feeling of having to be a genius composer or else I have no worth as a human being.   
I didn't realize it until I read that post by The School of Life, but my conscience is always nagging at me telling me I'm falling short of my standards if I'm not sitting 7-8 hours a day working with composition, and it will make me feel so shitty if what I'm making doesn't sound ""fucking good"" or ""genius"". Like I can't give myself a rest ever, besides those few times I get a lucky strike and create something really good, then I'll feel at ease for a day or two, and then the feeling comes back. 

  
At this point in my life I don't even feel like it's something I truly want anymore (becoming a great composer), but I'm having some trouble breaking free of my conscience, I'm having trouble really ""letting go"" and GOD I wish I could. I wanna feel happy and peaceful and live a meaningful life, but right now it's really making me down, anxious, unable to rest and even physically ill (I have trouble breathing, and experiencing quite a lot of fatigue, dizziness and being spaced out from all the stress).   


A part of me doesn't want to let go and give myself a break and feel peaceful, 'cause then I feel like I won't push myself to do the work necessary to become a great composer, but at the same time I'm not getting any work done, and this constant pressure is just making me feel depressed and anxious, and music has just become a massive pain in my life, like I never do it just because I enjoy doing it anymore (and I'm not sure if I've ever truly done it just because I wanted to do it cause doing it made me joyful). Like I want to do stuff in my life that makes me joyfull while I do it, and music is just making me fucking depressed, but I don't know how to let go of it...

A week or so later I began to experience really bad withdrawal symptoms. Diarrhea, really bad headache  etc. So I went back on them at 40mg.

I've been on the original 40mg for about 1 week however I still feel really depressed.  I am also experiencing a huge sense of loneliness. I don't really have any friends to go outside with. However I do have a lot of online friends and that has always been fine for me. Until now.

Hello Everyone,

The first thing that I accepted and it was a true realisation that none is going to come and help me only I can help myself.

In these uncertain times, we had lockdown where I live and living alone inside a room that's seemed very scary and this leads to overthinking and the same kind of thoughts over and over again the more you try to stop the intensity increases. After a few days into the lockdown.

I decided to change I need to do something. So I planned to meditate 2 times a day I was ready to do that if that could save me from going into darkness and web of thoughts.

You won't believe how much it helped me. When I started for the first few days I felt a storm of thoughts but I somehow kept going.

***It's been around 3 months from that day. I feel active and frequency of thoughts has reduced.***

I will highly recommend you guys Please try Meditation. I am planning to do something to help more people let's fight darkness together. **You can fill out a Google Form.**

I am not sure what I will do but will try to do my best (Maybe send something inspiring every week) just to have that extra push someday.

Will put the link to form and other resources in comments",25Jul2020,1

We see each other on his nights off for a few hours, but then I have to go to bed. I have been in some very unhealthy relationships before this one. There have been times when I’m so afraid that he’s going to yell at me or even get violent with me over something (because that’s what I’m used to, not because he’s aggressive), but he just doesn’t. He’s so patient and understanding and I’ve never been more excited about my future with another person. 

However...last night, we had a long conversation about how he has not been doing well mentally. It’s lonely working nights. He never gets to see or talk to me or his friends as much as he’d like to. He works a good job at the hospital with a $4 differential, so that’s why he stays on nights, but he told me last night that he’s considering switching to days or something because when he’s all alone and everybody is asleep, he gets very depressed and emotional. 

This morning, I found his suicide note while he was asleep. In it, he told me how perfect I am and how much he loves me, and he just wishes that he was strong enough to have more time with me.

I try to push these thoughts away but they are especially intrusive when I'm driving or trying to fall asleep, to the point where I find myself crying and unable to shake these thoughts.

When I try my best to not think of it, instead I get trapped in other thought patterns that are equally as stupid, such as when I feel good after being praised, but then as I turn my back I'd immediately go ""I don't really like what I'm doing anymore, but I'm only still going at this because I can earn praise from people around me like this, and I'm addicted to the feedback loop"" or ""I can't find anything to do which I like, so instead I'm just wandering from hobby to hobby until I burn out and need a different one"" which I know is not true at all but is what my mind falls back to when I try really hard to not think about getting left behind.

I have derealization disorder and it’s especially bad when I’m alone. Sometimes I’ll dissociate for HOURS at a time, and by the time my husband gets home from work, I will have had nothing done all day, despite having been home. It’s like those hours were a blink. My mom constantly accuses me of playing video games all day, but most days I don’t even turn the console on. The reality is that I’m just not there, I’m staring into space, disconnected from the world.

My dog does help, but she’s not really trained to recognize when it happens and I’m starting to think I need a trained service dog to wake me up from dissociative episodes, but I can’t get myself to start step 1, which is talking to a therapist.

Now, the only reason I even know I have DD is because I went to my sister’s doctor’s appointment for her own mental issues dealing with our father, and the doctor told me that was what I described to him.

I keep meaning to make an appointment of my own, but I keep second guessing myself and telling myself that the doctor won’t think there’s actually something wrong with me, and that I’m going to be embarrassed and regret that I even went.

This is all just my dad echoing in my mind, but I can’t get it out.

My husband and I are making an emergency move to distance us from my father, but the only place for rent doesn’t allow pets and I’m so afraid that if I’m home completely by myself, then I might just dissociate for entire days and completely lose that time. I’m currently in college doing online classes, and I don’t want to fail those because I’m dissociating all alone and nobody is there to wake me up. So I want to ask my sister’s doctor if he would write me an ESA letter, but I just can’t get myself to do it for fear of him thinking I’m just doing it so I can live with my dog.

206,"I started a new job 2 months ago and my mental health suffered immediately. It was my first job out of University. 

I had a very bad last semester in Uni mental health wise and I wish I had taken some time to collect myself before getting a job. I thought I’d be okay and took the plunge. It’s my first 8 hour a day job (I also go in for 1/2-1 hour every weekend day).  There are huge problems about the job for me though, it is not at all the right position for me and I really don’t enjoy the work and I also have experienced some unkindness from a coworker. I think even if I had been in a good place when I started I’d still be here now. 

Overall, I feel incredibly miserable. I felt very tempted last week to abuse alcohol (something I struggled with in the past) to escape. I decided in the car though, after buying my wine, not to take that step backward and I threw the wine away. But everyday I feel like I might kill myself over this job. 

Objectively it’s not the worst job, but I am completely in the wrong place mentally for it right now. I know I should give a 2 weeks but I can’t bear the idea of going back for another day. Since yesterday I feel my old self returning because I know I don’t have to go back on Monday. 

Luckily the finances of quitting won’t be a problem so this is 100% about mental health. Despite such a short notice I am not fucking any coworkers over as I have completed all my tasks in advance to account for this. 

I’m really afraid though of what my manager is going to text back. It’s a career style salaried job so I think they won’t expect this level of abruptness. I feel so guilty about quitting so suddenly.

I feel I am suffering as an adult from childhood truma my childhood I am working out wasn't good mental and physical abuse, before I started working on this I was in relationships which weren't healthy from both sides me to them and them to me, I am a chronic people pleaser mostly and always at detriment to my own self worth and dignity. And the key points being stuck in this world of fear of being abandoned by them so as soon as something came up it was easier to push away and not try.

I have stopped drinking fizzy drinks at home I still have them our and about at times but in the house just loads and loads of water doesn't sound like a lot but I was drinking a min of 2L a day and have done for years this as well as my antidepressants meant I put on so much weight. So about 2 1/2 months ago I cut my dependacy on the tablets I had been on the max dose for about 4 years and ramping up about 5 years on different stuff I have acknowledged my mind flexing and the good days are so much better but the bad days feel worse, and feel honestly writing this so fucking proud stepped down rather fast with the process being done over a couple of months and then last I have just given up smoking cigarettes a week in still vaping so no hard core give me nicotine.

But now I feel like I am living in survival mode! On edge waiting for the next thing to happen I have come out of the relationship mentioned above about a year ago but it took a long time to actually end lots of love still there but it's definitely over now she sounds like she moved on to someone else and blocked me so in my heart I am thinking it's really good for her but in my head I have been abandoned I am on my own screaming!! 

So my ask of help today is to see if you have any methods of supporting I know and have been talking to myself and do try and catch my self on the negative thoughts to say what the fuck come on get up do something.

So what are your coping methods ?",25Jul2020,1
208,"Sorry if this comes out like a long ramble post.

Today, I felt the worst I've ever felt.

I'll give some context. I (M18) recently (two days ago as of posting this) started working somewhere, it's my first real job. The first day went well, but I got home and just cried for an hour. I felt so terrible. I figure(d) that it's because the job involves a lot of different things to remember and also interacting with many strangers, both things I don't think I'm amazing at. I was really stressed and everything felt like a lot. I confided in my mother and sister about my feelings. They were both supportive to a degree, but they agreed that I should continue working and take breaks when I can get them (I get a 15 minute regulated break and a one hour lunch break, the latter of which I clock out for.) On the second day I worked, my sister (F32) let me eat in her car and gave me company. We also went and sat around at her friend's house for a second before I had to go back to work. This made me feel a bit better and I did not cry when I got home. I should also probably say that my sister has been giving me rides to and from work as well, because I do not have my own transportation or a drivers license yet.

Last night, after I got off work, I went out with a friend and we did some fun stuff, and it helped me decompress a bit. But the entire time I was out and about, I couldn't stop these thoughts running through the back of my head that were just stress thoughts about the job and working and everything I have to remember and do. Granted, I'm never going to have to take my work home with me or anything, but I guess it's all just sticking with me.

Fast forward to today. I woke up early without meaning to, and the entire time I've been awake today, all of those stressors have been all I can think about. I texted my really good friend who has been helpful before when I've felt anxious or depressed, and she was supportive. But the worst hit around the afternoon. I got up from my desk to make something to eat, because I hadn't eaten anything today and I thought that if my stomach felt better, I'd start to feel better. From the moment I got up, I've been hit with these unrelenting waves of depression. I made the food, took five bites of it and then just sat on my couch and cried. Usually I can anticipate if I'm going to cry or something, but this time, I didn't. It kinda just started happening.

Now I'm thinking about worse things. I texted a couple people just to say that I didn't feel well, and that I was feeling the same mentally as I had before, but worse. I reassured them that I won't do anything, because I really don't think I will. I'm just so fucking sick of this feeling. I'm so ready for it to be over that I'll do literally anything.

I don't wanna quit this job. I need the money if I want to start doing anything that I want to do, such as become a bit more independent and be able to drive myself and purchase my own items consistently. My mom and sister told me that, no matter how I'm scheduled, I should just take things one day at a time. But I can't stop thinking about the future. I can't stop thinking about what might happen if I continue to work this job. I can't stop thinking about everything I'd do to make myself stop feeling like this because I'm extremely fucking sick of it. I feel like a zombie and a prisoner inside myself. I had to stop myself from crying more earlier because my parents got home and I feel like I've already bothered my mom enough with my stress regarding my job. She asked me if I wanted to speak to someone, ""like a counselor"", but I said ""I don't know"" because I wasn't sure what to say. I feel like I do, but I don't know how that's gonna get paid for.

I just kinda feel like I'm at the end of my story. This is my demise. I'm ready for it to be over. But I don't know how to end it and I don't know how I can end it and I know that I shouldn't end it, but I don't know what else to do because I feel completely helpless. All my peers, even ones younger than me, do just fine with their job and responsibilities. One of my best friends is a year younger than me and she has a car and a job and she is nowhere near how I feel.

I don't know what else to say. I just needed to say something somewhere I thought that people would care/be able to maybe give helpful advice or just support.",25Jul2020,1

I can't remember the last time that I actually felt happy, and I want to keep it that way. Every day I lay in my bed emotionless. I've grown to enjoy it.

214,I've always been close to my grandmother. I loved with her for a year after my dad left and I spent a lot of time down there before that too. So naturally I was always close to her. But she has some MASSIVE PROBLOMS that I just can't take anymore first of all she's a raging alcoholic. And for the time I lived with her she would do nothing but drink herself into oblivian. I had a lot going on at the time and I feel into a depression I would stay up eating my feeling all night only to cry myself to sleep I couldn't cope. My mom was alos living there but not for long because one nigh something horrible happend. My uncle who also lived there stole my mom's car he came back like three hours later and when my mom asked him why he did it he told her to fuck off and went to his room. Now let me tell you about my uncle he was a drug addict who was just a over all horrible person. Safe to say I never liked him. Anyway the day past everyone stayed in there room. And then the night came it was 9 o clock and he came out shouting at my mom he threw the TV that SHE got him at her and missed he called her all sorts of names. My mom called my dad who she was talking to again and he reluctantly took me home l. The next day my uncle tryed to stab my mom. I lived with my emotinaly abusive father who tryed to get me pyt in Foster care. Long story short I ended up living with my grandmother and uncle again and I feel into a deeper depression and nearly feel into and eating disorder.

I moved in with my mother evetualy and my new step dad he's okay but I have a lot of problems with him but I'm not getting into that cuz there verry small. Things went by and I kept in contact with my grandmother. Now let's get into my grandmother she has hit me multiple times and we have gotten in a lot of arguments. In one she said the whole incedent with my uncle was mine and my mom's fault keep in mind I was 10. Recently my uncle died of a heroin over dose. Who wouldve guessed. My grandmother has been verry cold with my since and has treated me like shit I used to always walk to town with her so she could do her shopping and I would carry her verry heavy might I add bags up home. I tried my best to be nice to her but when ever I came to visit she would complain and ask when In going home. Recently she got in an argument with my mother while I was there and she said that I used to bully my uncle and that's why she hates me I WAS FUCKING 12 even after all he did to me I tried my best to be nice to him I haven't spoken to her since I and tbh I never want to see her agin but I feel kinda bad for that I don't know if im being a prick. Recently I've been getting verry depressed again I've become more obsessed with my weight and social anxiety had gotten to a point where its affecting my life. My mother's become very emotionaly abusive too she has bipoler and is so nice some times but that changes so fast there have been times she's called me pathetic worthless selfies all sorts of names. And as a result my self estime had gotten to a point where I honsesly hate myself. Her moments are getting more frequent she snaps at me and screems at me the the most retarded of reasons I honestly can't cope anymore and I don't know what to do.

215,"I have never been a very talkative person. But generally when I am talking to my close friends, I can talk for hours, and be funny and witty the whole while. However I go through bouts of depression where my speech just stops working, sometimes for weeks.

I hide away from meeting anyone and don't pick any phone calls or reply to any texts (which I very rarely get anyway) because of the looming fear of not being able to hold the conversation beyond asking ""what's up"" or ""how are you"". This has seriously started affecting all aspects of my life. I am losing friends, losing potential partners, my life revolves around me forcing myself to be able to talk for length.

Every sentence someone says to me seems like a test. I cannot seem to come up with a response to anything. I feel the need to be funny/witty in every response I say, otherwise I end up feeling like a boring person, a social burden. And needless to say, I almost always end up being able to say nothing and avoiding the conversation entirely. Even with my close friends now. All of this has left me very lonely, and every failed attempt at a conversation leaves a huge dent in my already minimal self esteem.

Anyone else went through anything similar? Did you manage to get out of it? If so, how?",25Jul2020,1
216,"Feel like a loser

No matter how much therapy I do, I feel like a loser. I am 24 years old, living with my parents, and my temporary job is about to end next week. I will be unemployed AGAIN and for some reason I can’t seem to find a job even though I am college educated with a strong major (finance). 

I spent my college years “fighting” mental illness that Im now unsure that I ever even had. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder a year and a half ago after having a psychotic episode in front of my therapist and psychiatrist. I had been diagnosed with bipolar for 2-3 years before that. So they changed the diagnosis on me to something WORSE and ever since then Ive felt doomed. 

No one will ever want to date me because I am sick. I struggle at work because I have a flat affect (my face doesnt express emotions right so my nonverbal communication is off) and I have memory problems. 

Because of these things I stopped some of my medication last week. So far Ive only been... well. Things are going OK, except I keep thinking about how much of a failure and freak that I am more so than usual. I can’t hardly stop thinking about it. Plus, the other thing is the last couple of days Ive been getting a little dizzy for a few seconds at a time. Like the room will spin out of nowhere. Idk if this is all warning signs that stopping medication is a bad idea or not, but besides that- I do feel like my thoughts are coming out stronger, its just that Im having a lot more negative ones. 

Maybe this is out of your pay grade but I cant talk to my parents about it. They usually just somehow make me feel worse about things when I complain about stuff, calling me negative and getting angry. 

I just feel like such a loser. I spent so much time being “sick” in college that I feel like I wasted so much time I could have spent developing myself.  I feel like such a failure. Everyone is so much further ahead of me in life, and IDK if Ill ever catch up.

Being this way I haven't felt like I *need* more, I don't have a desire to do chase anything or that I can aim higher. I can't imagine how this peace and comfort I've wanted my whole life isn't exactly where I should be. Should I feel motivated or passionate? I don't have a desire to improve my financial situation, work full time, do post grad study or anything really.

224,"What the pandemic taught me about myself

For years I’ve been living for other people. Doing what’s best for others even if it wasn’t what I wanted or even if it made me downright miserable.

The pandemic made me feel like my life mattered. Being home day after day with the person who I thought was my best friend but who was actually the person who was making me lie to myself. The lies I told to him and the lies I told to myself and others around me. A fascad of happiness. Alchohol, weed, food, deception ....just so many things that had been hidden from the naked eye of onlookers and family. I was miserable. She was miserable. He was also miserable, if not more than anyone else. I looked at him, sweaty and overweight. Eye bags and the smell of whisky on his breath. The idea of “making love” or anything with this person was a daily fear. How can I be stuck in a house with someone who used to make me laugh and now I’d rather be anywhere but here. I was pretending it was okay. Get me drunk enough and I’ll spend time with you I’ll sleep with you but it was still gross.  I had to psych myself out or pretend he was someone else which is a disservice comparing his lumpy body to anyone even remotely attractive. He slept in a hole he had built with his excess weight and slept the day away each hungover weekend. He constantly took Naps in the daytime while I danced in whisps around him making thing happen and getting life done. 
It’s hard to look at someone in the eye and take them seriously when they can’t take care of themselves. It’s hard to love yourself when the person you married is the person you loathe and then you loathe yourself.
Why am I doing this to myself? Did he love me? How could he? Why are we still here going through these motions when it’s literally torture. I think I hate him. 

The pandemic taught me all of these things all of these fears about living the rest of my life this way. Imagining never being able to escape this place. What if wearing masks is something I would have to physically wear on my face outside of the house forever?! Then it hit me. I’ve been wearing this metaphorical mask for years already and I needed to get it off.",25Jul2020,1

I am a people pleaser but I can see how I keep victimizing myself on purpose. I find my true self so thoroughly repulsive in a way that no one else, no matter how well I know them, or how many issues they have, seems to be. 

I am so so so driven by these infantile desires and there is this giant narcissistic monster inside me, which no one else, except my mother, seems to be able to see.

I've been taking 5000 IU Vitamin D3 supplements for a year now (doctor told me I was deficient a year ago based on blood test results and told me to take the specific supplements I'm taking). I'm also in therapy, which has helped as well.

I've also been reading that magnesium supplements can help with this a bit? How much truth is there to this? Obviously my therapist can't recommend anything like this to me, so when I asked her about it, she told me to consult with my physician. My primary care physician is kind of old school and is pretty much just like ""oh just exercise and try to reduce your stress. You're fine."" However, I'd really like to try whatever works that's not full on prescription drugs (because my stress and anxiety aren't at the point to do anything like that yet).

I've struggled with mental illness on and off the past 4 years or so with major bouts of anxiety and some depression.

258,"32F here! First, some backstory: I endured a lot of emotional trauma when I was growing up: horrendous bullying at school, an emotionally unavailable mother who was also manipulative and verbally abusive (sometimes physical abuse, tho it was more rare), a passive father who enabled my mother, zero friends at all, etc. I have diagnoses of major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, ADHD, and several body focused repetitive behaviors (trichotillomania and dermatillomania). I began self injuring at age 11 and started seeing a therapist when I was 13 or so. I saw this same therapist for close to ten years and I grew very close and attached to her.  I believe she saved my life. I stopped seeing her in my early 20s when I moved away.

Fast forward to now and I’m 32. Married with young children. Still no friends at all and I struggle with relating to others. I’ve been living in my new state for 10 years now and have tried numerous therapists over the past decade but none measured up against my strict standards. I didn’t click with anyone like I did with my first therapist. I’ve been struggling lately so I decided to try *again* to find a therapist, and I finally found someone that I really click and connect with!! I started weekly sessions with her about 6 weeks ago. 

Here’s my problem: I have very become attached to her. I count down the days until our sessions together, I think about her all the time, I will email her when I’m having a particularly rough time (she encourages this as a way to vent and get feelings out but stresses that there’s no expectation of a reply prior to our session). I just love that someone seems to truly care about me and my struggles, and who is supportive and wants to help me on my journey.  What I don’t fully understand is *why* I feel this still, as a 32 year old adult. It made sense when I was younger because I literally had no other support or outlet. But now, I’m married to a wonderful man who is supportive and caring. But it’s not quite the same, I guess.  I don’t know how to *not* feel close/attached to her. I’ve sorta mentioned this to her and she seems unconcerned and has said that she’s helping me to practice opening up and being vulnerable with others, so that I can eventually do it on my own and have meaningful relationships (friendships) with people aside from my husband. She’s also helping me challenge 20 years of thoughts and feelings of  self hatred and of being inadequate.  But I really worry that I’m trying too hard to show her that I’m broken and in need of her help. I want her to *really* see and understand how much I need her. But is that normal? Do other people do this? Or am I just some kind of messed up??

260,"Hi everyone... The last 2 months I have felt o lonely even though my boyfriend is with me and my anxiety is just eating me up from the inside out... I feel constantly sad and I don't know what to do. Lockdown has gotten more strict where I live and I feel like that is just making it so much worse. I can't go anywhere. I am 100% stuck at home. I feel like I am going insane. 

I don't even have anyone to talk to besides my boyfriend and I can't even tell him what's wrong because I don't know what's going on anymore. I am a mess...I don't know what to do...",25Jul2020,1
262,"Hello all,

I have something wrong with me...I don’t know what.

I feel absolutely elated some days and other days I can barely move out of my bed. I compulsively lie to hide my mood, lack of ‘excitement’ at the weekends etc to my friends and colleagues. I had a bit of trouble ‘getting it up’ and then other days I can go for hours...someone suggested I had signs of Bipolar, I bought this up with my GP and he basically dismissed it. I have anxiety and have all the bells and whistles that go with that but I really do wonder if I have something else wrong here. I used to see a physiatrist back when I was diagnosed with anxiety but that was a few years back and nothing like this had ever happened then. My family is going through something turbulent at the moment that I’d rather not share as it would take away from the point (I’m already rambling!) anyway, this seems to have heightened my anxiety and also bought on these new symptoms. The other day I spend all the money in my current account just so I could feel something. I was recently made redundant and I keep dreaming about suicide but when I’m awake I don’t feel like doing that at all. 

I’m so confused and my gp is a useless cunt and I can’t see anyone else due to the pandemic. I wonder if I should walk into the doctors surgery and request a different doctor?

Any help is absolutely appreciated, I am losing my mind (literally!)",25Jul2020,1
263,I’m beginning to feel more and more disassociated from the world...lack of compassion and empathy. Apathy? I’ve been having homicidal ideations but sane enough to not act on them. I’ve literally be in the house all day...in the dark...lost...and so damn lonely. Why are things like this? Where did I go wrong?,25Jul2020,1
264,"this is a lot to read but i’m genuinely concerned. i have been for a while but no one agrees that she needs to see a fucking doctor. i think she has adhd, autism, etc. something like that. i’ve also suspected tourette’s before. at times i feel like she acts possessed, or psychotic. she’s 11, but she has the brain of a 4 year old. my little cousins (5&amp;6) are
by comparison a lot more normal and mature than her. she just doesn’t know when to stop. don’t get me wrong, she’s smart but something just isn’t right. i don’t even know where to start. a lot of these behaviors are hard to explain over the internet but if you met her in person you would understand. 

- she stares right at me while i talk to her and then says, “huh?”. she didn’t hear me at all and i have to repeat myself 2, 3 times. and then a few minutes later she asks me what i said again. 
- if i’m trying to tell her something serious, sad, etc she just doesn’t take it seriously. sometimes she’ll laugh. keep in mind she’s 11 and smart enough to understand the things i’m saying, and old enough to listen. 
- if i tell her to stop doing something, for example screaming, spitting on me, hitting me, she does it more. she disobeys me constantly, and my mom. she calls my mom stupid, dumb, cusses at her, etc and my mom has never once retaliated or disciplined her. my dads a different story. 
- sometimes she’ll get up, and then run a few laps around the house and jump up and down while shaking her arms rapidly and then goes back and sits down. kinda like adhd, extra energy but she’s also pretty lazy. she also never sits down while watching tv. she paces back and forth while watching. 
- i have a pet bird. my sister absolutely loves her but when she gets mad or upset she’ll try to force my bird to be with her, kiss her, etc. bird keeps flying away from her and she chases her and deliberately puts her on her finger. the bird loves my sister too but i feel like she’s losing trust because my sisters acting this way. it’s borderline animal abuse i guess? but she loves animals so i don’t understand why she gets these random crazy fits. 
- if something is bad, or dangerous or risky, she’ll do it just to do it because i guess she feels like she needs to do everything? it’s almost as if she doesn’t care about potential danger and she just wants to do whatever she wants 
- she says something and then doesn’t stop repeating until someone says “yes i agree with you” even if they don’t agree with her. if she asks a question, she won’t stop asking until you just tell her the answer she wants to hear even if it’s wrong, and most of the time she knows it’s wrong. she just wants to hear it out of your mouth. 

i might be over analyzing everything but if she was younger i would understand her acting out and doing stuff like this but she’s 11 and about to go to middle school. she has her good days too but most days she’s just a whole different person. she should’ve outgrew stuff like this a long time ago. it’s kinda like she grew up but her mind didn’t. it’s driving me crazy because she’s just so annoying. not to a normal sibling extent, i feel like i’m living with a mental patient.",25Jul2020,1
265,"Part of the reason that NO ONE outside of strangers on anonymous online forums really knows about my struggles is because I don't want to get hated on for being an ""attention whore."" My biggest fear is that people will think I developed my eating disorder for attention. But does anyone with an ED truly JUST want attention? I mean, there are so many better ways to get attention than starving yourself almost to death. If I just wanted attention, I'd upload a you tube video of myself singing while wearing a ridiculous hat or some shit. My ED mainly developed because I had body image issues and wanted to numb some feelings I was having about an experience that happened to me when I was a younger. However, there is a small part of me that felt gratified when people started to become concerned when they saw I was getting scarily thin. Is that attention seeking?

Please don't hate on me for this, but I feel like people who are attention seeking get much more hate than they deserve. To be clear, I think that faking a mental or physical illness or lying about having a crappy life situation or trying to capitalize on your pain for ""clout"" on social media is despicable, but people who are genuinely struggling shouldn't be penalized for wanting attention. Like why is it so bad to want to feel seen and heard when 99 percent of the time you feel invisible and like you're screaming into a vacuum.  What's so wrong with wanting people to see your pain and help you? How is it a sin to just want to be taken care of and loved for once in your life?",25Jul2020,1
266,"I had hopes and dreams, I was less mentally ruined. Things were shitty sometimes but were waaayy better in comparison to now. It feels like this is the end of my life and all signs are telling me to get out. If this is product of getting older, I dont think I can take anymore.",25Jul2020,1
