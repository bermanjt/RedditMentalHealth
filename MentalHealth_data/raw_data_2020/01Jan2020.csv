0,"i wasn’t meant to leave past 15 yet here i am, i’m 16 and so far life is completely shit, my girlfriend of 4 years snaps at me and doesn’t know if she wants to be with me due to my anxiety and bulimia, i cannot leave the house, i don’t know what i want to do in the future (i didn’t plan bc i thought i would’ve killed myself by now but i’m too much of a pussy to actually do it) i doubt i’ll be able to do anything in the future because of my anxiety (agoraphobia)- ive never been on a bus by myself. i’m lonely, my friends treat me like shit by constantly snapping at me and insulting me for stupid shit (i didn’t know one of my friends had a bf as i was nearly hospitalised for my ed so they all got angry and told me i was pretending to not know). i hate the fact i’m still here i don’t know what to do. i’m not looking for replies, just someone to hear me and understand me. i’m so miserable and sick of being here. i just let people take the piss out of me because all i do is forgive them as i’m scared i’m overreacting. im not meant to be here",01Jan2020,1
1,"I feel like i’m watching my life from inside of my head. I don’t feel connected or aware of my surroundings. For example my brother in law was standing next to me and I didn’t notice. This has been going on for the past hour, at first I felt euphoric kinda. When I talk it feels weird, feels like my body is moving faster than my mind, my mind is in slow motion, feel like I can’t capture things correctly. Also, it feels like i’m not here, and the noises and my family’s voices talking to me don’t make me feel anything. I’m not making sense right now but I can’t put my thoughts together. Also feel lightheaded, but not dizzy, just high.",01Jan2020,1
2,"I’m feeling really alone today. About a year ago, I was in a bad accident, and I now have a spinal cord injury. It’s been an awful year - mentally, and physically. I don’t have many close friends that I can talk to, about the hard things that are going on in my life. I think because it’s New Years, I’m feeling especially alone. No one asked me to be a part of their plans. I’m just at home alone with my cat. I know it’s just another day, but I’m feeling sad. Does anyone else feel like this ever?",01Jan2020,1

is taking a toll on my life. I go to see my friends

me out with this. I can go into more detail if

7,"Today marks the day of a new year and a new decade. This time of the year can sometimes leave us feeling worthless and alone, but it gives us an opportunity to start again and work towards getting, or being, better.

Stoicism is a school of philosophy that can help us do just that. The book, 'The Daily Stoic' provides daily passages from popular philosophers aimed to help us approach and navigate challenges throughout our lives.


The passage for January 1st reads,

“The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control. Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are my own …”

8,"For some reason I got very anxious thinking about raising my voice  and I have no idea why. I was sitting around and thought of how I never raise my voice(like calling out to someone or going “woo!” all enthusiastically). My voice has always been low for as long as I remember and I rarely yell. I found that odd and funny and decided to yell just to experience raising my voice however when I tried to I felt very anxious and yelling or speaking in a loud voice was was actually very difficult. At first my brain just didnt let me raise my voice but after some trying I felt less anxious and raised my voice. I’m partly worried and partly curious as to why the hell that happened. Any ideas?

12,"Often when I come up with artistic ideas I end up feeling like I'm being pretentious or dishonest. I'll think about a poem I'd like to write or a piece of art I'd like to make, but instantly just think that I don't have the ability or skill to make that piece of art and therefore it would be pretentious to do it. It's really hard to explain but this also makes me feel like there's no point in actually doing research and doing a proper piece of art because it would all be in hopes of getting rid of this feeling that I'm not really an artist. It makes me feel like if I train to be a good artist, it won't matter because I won't really be training to be better but to feel more entitled to make art. It's really hard to explain.

I've been to the psychologist this year and he told me I have OCD. I don't know if this is an experience common to all artists or just related to my condition. I feel like I'll never be able to be honest with the art I create because I do it to consciously make art, not for the sake of art itself. Please ask me to explain further if I'm not clear enough.",01Jan2020,1
13,"Hey guys I'm new to reddit so I hope i'm doing this right.

Me and a few friends decided we want to start a non profit/group to destigmatize mental health in Asian-american communties (mostly Chinese community for now), since we've all had personal experiences with some of the culture specific issues Asians have with mental illnesses and suicide.  We're in the middle of creating a website as a hub for our information, and a blog style section where we can post perspectives of asians-mostly teens- and their experiences with mental health to share and kind of convince parents that the issue actually exists. In addition, we want to host workshops centered around themes asian parents like so that we can attract them, since hosting a mental health specific workshop catered to asians probably won't have many attendees. For example, one of the  workshops will be educating parents on how to encourage their children to college (something they take super seriously) without destroying their mental health. 

These are our most concrete ideas so far, and we are considering doing things in the future like culturally educating mental health professionals so they can better understand our cultural issues, and working with existing organizations to create resources that asians can refer to that are culture specific and put them on our website. If you have any other ideas that you'd like to let me know about, please PM me!",01Jan2020,1

I know my boss will think I’m faking it if I call in tomorrow unless I get a doctors note and I was thinking of just going to the crisis center since I can’t afford the hospital and I don’t think I’d have proof.

The problem is recently I have been extremely bad mentally because I tried to come off my meds and with in 5 days of intermittent dosage I was struggling with my head. It's been a week now since I started taking them again daily and it still not working so this whole gf situation has made me even worse. Another friend doesnt think she will break up with me but I have extreme paranoia and every little detail is important and I just have a feeling. When I get to my extreme worst my head is just a place of constant pain, but it isnt a pain you can feel you just know it's there. My whole body just feels like crap and the constant thoughts make me feel like there is no way out but one.

When the abuse started  a few weeks  ago he became  so disgusted  with himself  he wanted  to die but I convinced  him to finally go to therapy instead. He definitely  has undiagnosed  mental  health  issues so I'm hoping  this is the first  step to healing.  It's the only  reason  why  I'm still  here. Hes made it clear he doesn't  want  these emotions he struggles with and doesn't  want  to be like that. He has tried to handle  his emotions  better until we can start  therapy  next week.  

He wants  me to go with him, he let me pick the therapist.  When I talked  to the therapist  on the phone  I said I wasn't  sure if we needed couples  counseling or if he needed it alone and to see both of us to give us some insight.  Therapist agreed and we set the appointment  next week.  

My husband  is getting  nervous  about  going.  He wants  to get to the bottom  of what's going  on with him, but hes scared if he admits  that he smokes weed, often  thinks about killing  himself or that he's  abused me that the therapist  will file a report  and he'll  go to jail - which to be frank, won't  help things get better.

During high school despite being angry at points I bit my tongue hard on certain things until to the point I gathered a defeatist attitude.

I work very hard at what I do and I take lots of pride in my work, however it can get the best of me when I put too much pressure on myself. I have a job at my schools IT help desk which I love and it’s at least something that makes me feel like I’m good enough in someway. I went to vocational high school for IT and I worked at my dad’s IT company for co-op. 

Finding an internship has put so much pressure on me. So far I applied to 9 places that I want to work for over the summer but my search isn’t over yet. All this stress from applying is making me feel worthless because I feel like either I’m not good enough for the job im applying for,
Or that there’s nothing special about my resume. 

Im also a club officer for my schools cyber security club. And I also held a leadership position in my old dorm’s hall council in sophomore year. So I have experience being in leadership and collaboration which are all important. Though it sounds like I have things going for me, deep down I’m depressed feeling like I’ll never amount to anything because of the pressure I put on myself has given me unrealistic expectations. 

I feel like I’m going insane and there’s no way to stop this stress. I have diagnosed depression and I take meds for It which help. I see a therapist in school once every 2-3 weeks.

And it was really hard actually, being there. We told ourselves we wanted help, we wanted someone trained to talk us through how to live more authentically and be open and out as a system.

And we expected some dissociation and the ""scatter-braining"" that comes with it, but when we got there... she didn't want to hear a word about us or DID or the system. She said that was ""not her job"" and obviously that put us straight into survival mode and made the dissociation so much worse, we probably seemed brain damage how much we trailed off or forgot what we were going to say.

I just... we thought she was going to know what to do, but she was just cold and mean... ended up recommending a PTSD therapist :( we've been to several of those and they ALWAYS say they aren't trained to deal with us...

12/31/2019
I have been struggling for months to a year in silence after a relapse in major depression and anxiety. I started journaling my suicidal thoughts so that if I wasn’t able to tell anyone that if the worst happened they might know what was going on. I wrote down my wishes for my body after death, researched the most environmentally conscious one so my last act would be a good one. 

I made the poor choice in 2018 to stop going to treatment just when things started to get better during . (Bi-Weekly copays add up quick even with the good insurance I am blessed to have due to a parent with a good job and my age) 

I have tried finding help but each therapist or psychiatrist I have been turned away because they weren’t accepting patients. They didn’t ask what treatment I was looking for and what I needed they just denied me immediately. I have avidly avoided the emergency just because i feel observation would make the problems in my mind worse. 

I live in a more rural part of my state so a good doc can be 1.5-2 hour trip=not good. I’ve been experiencing every side effect of it. Naturally things can get very bad very quickly. I’ve had persistent thoughts of suicide everyday as soon as I wake up and until I fall asleep which have gotten more prominent as time passes. 

I stopped leaving my house 6 weeks ago because every time I did my commute to school or work I was scared a bad day would tempt me into trying to hurt myself and indirectly possibly others physically on the roads. I dropped out of school for the second time since 2018 and Had to leave my job of 3 years because the illness I was taking over and I didn’t have the courage to ask for help. This has been a struggle I have battled in mostly silence until the last few years. I am vocal with some friends about this but have only talked with my mom a handful of times about it and the last conversation where I was open about what was happen 1.5 years ago. I have been lying and trying to pretend that I’m okay because she hasn’t dealt well with learning that I am suffering so badly. She didn’t understand what was going because I tried so hard to hide the signs when I could. 

Christmas was REALLY hard this year and my anxiety plus trying to detox from weed has kept me awake for last 4 days straight. This morning after another night distracting myself with tv in hopes I would just exhaust myself, my mom came down the stairs to start her day. I don’t know what she even said I think she asked about when school was starting again but the exhaustion mixed with the thoughts in my head exploded. Just created word vomit I started to just tell her everything because I couldn’t stop the honestly. I sobbed and she sobbed she showed anger and she showed compassion. We had the best conversation I have ever had and it was something I never thought she was capable of. 

I haven’t started any treatment as this all happened today. But the hardest part is admitting to others what is going on and I was able to do that. Somewhat against my will and subconsciously maybe some part in my brain knew what it was deciding, I don’t know and there’s no way to really find out.

Life is hard and the holidays can be hard when you’re alone and even when you’re with people. Things become out of our control and that is okay and that is normal. Human beings have a collective knowledge that is so vast and immeasurable that with all that knowledge we can still not fully understand when someone is sick and that it’s okay and we can be helped and be better. 

This happened at 7 am the morning of the last day of the year. The last day of the decade. 6 weeks ago I thought I wouldn’t make it to Christmas and my family would have to bury me. I thought I would be starting 2020 in a dark place figuratively and possibly literally. But I’m still here. Please don’t give up if you find this story to connect with you on some level. The world needs our voices and our compassion and even our weaknesses. 

I don’t know what my future holds but for the first time in a long time the darkness isn’t as dark.",01Jan2020,1
32,"Cross posting to relevant subreddits as I really need advice here, Apologies in advance for grammar mistakes and as this will be long and I'm on mobile, I am typing this out in bed while this is still fresh in my mind, also happy new year.

*TLDR: among another stressful life events, my friends mum has been recently diagnosed with potentially fatal cancer, my friend is not coping and tonight she broke down and openly talked about wanting to die and also talked about how and when she would do it. I am scared for my friend and need some advice on the next steps would appreciate any and all support on this. I live in Northern Ireland UK.*

So some background about my friend which is relevant to this. She is in a relationship with my brother and is like a sister to me. Her mum has recently been diagnosed with stage 2 pancreatic cancer, as far as we know it has not spread to other systems and she is receiving chemo at present, we are waiting to find out how effective the chemo will be to determine whether she may be a candidate for the very life  threatening surgery to remove as much cancer as possible. Going by the little info the doctors have said the prognosis is not going to be great and we are looking at months to years if we are lucky and perhaps months or weeks if not, her mum may day on the operation table or soon after due to high risk complications of the surgery. 


During a small new years eve get together my friend was hosting she suddenly got up and was absent for quite some time. I went to check on her and found her with her boyfriend(my brother) very upset and sobbing/struggling to breathe. When I asked her what was wrong she said several times how she wanted to die, wanted to kill herself, didn't want to be in this planet anymore. I am a newly qualified nurse so when I heard my friend talk about killing herself (which I have never heard her say before) I naturally tried to be an active listener, ask her what was getting to her and making her want to die etc. I also had to ask if she had any Intentions of harming herself in this moment or later on, and asked if she had made any sort of plans or how she would try it if she felt like it.

She told me that she would slit her wrists with a knife as soon as her mum was dead and that there wouldn't be a reason for her to exist anymore after that. I listened to her, hugged her and I didnt try to fight her or be judgemental I just made sure that she heard me when I told her that I loved her very much and that so many people In her life would be devastated if she wasn't here anymore.

She mentioned other things too, feeling pressure from multiple places and people, work, friendship issues and feeling lack of family support. I mentioned perhaps she reach out to HR in her job and let them know that she is not coping and perhaps be granted some leave of absence for mental health reasons. I broached the issue of seeking professional mental health support through the health service  as she was clearly struggling to cope, but she says she's already on some sort of 9 month waiting list. (I'm living in Northern Ireland and the mental health services are notoriously difficult to be seen by even when you are in crisis and suicidal.) 

I suggested her opening up to a counsellor, or talk to her doctor about her depressive feelings in hopes a medical professional may signpost her to some real help or perhaps try medications that might help. She is not the type to open up to medical staff, in the past she has been seen by counsellors for anxiety and she was not honest during the initial session and pretended that she didn't have a problem and did not return for a second.

After her going through cycles of being more normal, apologising and then getting so upset she could barely breathe and talking about wanting to die again, she eventually went to sleep. And now I'm lying here not knowing what to do but knowing that there is something seriously wrong and that my friend needs help.

What do i do reddit? Do I broach this subject with her tomorrow when she's sober? Do I wait for her to talk to me? Where can I go to get some real genuine mental health support for my friend(live in Northern Ireland UK) ? Do I get family members involved or try to get other friends to reach out and let her know she is loved? How do I let my friend feel safe enough to open up to me and tell me what she needs from me? Being a nurse I would feel icky sharing some of the details of this with people who aren't medical professionals able to help and to be honest I feel torn between respecting my friends wishes to remain silent and being vocal to others who may be able to help. All I know is something needs to be done ASAP because I can see my friend drowning in front of my eyes and I can see she needs help. I'm scared I will lose her someday soon.",01Jan2020,1

36,"I already had an account on this forum, but it was apparently deleted for no reason. I'll tell you my story from here: I pretty much had childhood trauma. Ever since I was a toddler, until the age of 3, my father and my mother were living in a toxic relationship, for the simple reason that my dad was a well known abuser, ex criminal who ended up in prison for beating up a girl on the streets always lying on the streets or sleeping on her wife's bed all day. Because of this, economy was starting to become a problem as my mother was the only active worker in our family, which is what created a discussion between them(which is funny, since my dad always presented himself as a nice guy during his young times with her and even looked like he was a good student and also a fan of science). The main reason why he became this way however is because of his mother preferring his brother ever since they were both childs, which led my dad to end up with the wrong people on the streets and getting her mother angry at him. Anywho, after they left each other around 2006, I started becoming more and more shy, weak minded and easily offended. I would always be bullied at school or in sport teams due to my extremely fragile mind, and I would Always lay on my mother crying because of being rejected and hated on. I also always had songs(scary ones for the most part) repeating themselves in my mind, I would love to imitate the emotions while listening to an heavy metal song from a game through facial and body expressions(I can also imitate the singer's voices perfectly), had imaginary girlfriends(not guys because I didn't feel like a loner, I just had a weak spot for sex, mainly for evil ones such as bitches or prostitutes or emo ones in a reality show, almost as I could relate with their weak mindsets and would relate to them)  and also had narcisistic traits, for example menacing my mother of taking away love from her if she didn't give me what I wanted or scolded me. I also had a huge fear of wolves though, I hate nukes for the most part and sometimes I immagine my room being an abandoned graveyard(kinda like the one from Ed, edd and eddy) and I feel like getting raped by women sometimes. I also had a mission failed song stuck in my head(from a particular videogame called jak and daxter) or a song from the spectral vale in Pacman always giving me chills on my back and stuck repeatedly every single day, which is funny since I'm by no means a videogame addict but I did play a good number of games In my life, and sometimes I would even cry for no reason, like for example when standing on a table at night for launch. Anywho, I'm in the 11th grade and things have completely changed since I was a kid, but on an even more negative side notes. All of my fears disappeared all of a sudden, but so did my overprotective mother(which I forgot to add, I had a dipendence for and would always cry if she was only a little bit hurt as a child) who died of cancer when I was 13 and all my illusions suddenly disappeared. Until the age of 13, I've been left by one of my best friends whom I found out only pretended he cared about me but would talk about how I am a loser on my back, and most importantly, I had lost  a women I would still consider one of the hugest crushes of my life and would have a threesome with the current one if she agreed. She wasn't the kindest person on heart but I really, and I mean really could relate with her, she was weak, had obsessions with her abusive mother and was a good manipulator but not in evil terms, she would manipulate me into having sex with her and she legit had empathy for me. She wasn't tricking me, I know this for a fact beacuse even before my mother died she was the only woman who would send me a message time to time and ask me what happened if I was away for a long time beacuse of  cause of being sick and yeah, she had OCD and thinks of herself as a narcissist(and I'm definitely sure that while she's may have been perverted she is definitely not even close to a narcissist if being something worse than it is something I'm close to being, she is just really fragile and think she needed someone to protect her, she was a good woman and by good I don't mean nice beacuse none of us is nice, though she would be respectful and do the right thing), and she was also a beast at english(both me and her are Italians), she would literally process every single world like her brain didn't even need to register it, it came off as a natural process. Same thing for me, the difference being that I'm good both in terms of grammar and pronounce. Anywho, we had a FNaF group at the ages of 11(yeah I know, cringe right) in which some of my friends were also in, and we would usually roleplay as she sended me images about the characters we were role-playing having sex togheter. I know, we definitely aren't the most normal guys in the universe, but I can reassure you than outside our perversions we are nice guys and don't hurt anyone. SHE doesn't, at least, cause that's where the bad part's kicking in for me. After my last cry after she left me with a lesbian(she's bisexual), my tears officially wore off from my face for the last time. After that my mother died, the world looked like way more negative than how would already see it before. My conscience, it just feels like it's broken. Everything around me looks pixeled, and I have no empathy anymore. I don't care about what other people think about me, as thus I even like seeing them suffer. Ever since I entered in high school, i had started developing a really nihilistic visual about life(no, I'm not edgy and I'm not tryna act like the Joker, I had developed these feelings before even knowing the Joker was a nihilist, whether you wanna believe that or not I don't care), always being aggressive and bringing out the hypocrisy in others and punching and beating up the aunts I've been living with since a child(and they've been pretty abusive towards me). They have a bad tendency to smoke and I no longer cry when I get criticized by them, I just can't stand them when they try to act like they have the rights to judge me when they made me this way, so whenever I see my aunts doing that I throw those fucking cigars outta the window, aim for their eyes and put my fingers into them or giving them a (not strong or else I'd be arrested) low punch on the chin, to the point where sometimes I even went as taking a knife and hitting my Aunt on the belt with it, but I had to stop after a little bit as I knew the police would've eventually found that out. One day, one of my aunts even cried and ranted about how they failed me, and I would laugh(I always laugh when I'm pissed) and I'd say to her ""don't you understand that this is for your own good HAHAHAHAAHAH"" and then I went back in my room listening to metal as I always do. For some reason, I also love being behind people and blocking their way with my legs, it just feels satisfying for me having them to break their own patience  and I also see everyone as robots, as I've already heard those phrases before in my dreams or movies, almost as if I'm outside a sort of matrix. That was, until I had started hurting probably the sweetest woman in my life, better than her predecessors. She had lost her mother and his dad is an abusive police man, and she's extremely weak minded. I tried getting in a relationship with her, but ever since I don't have empathy, I feel like it's not the same thing anymore, I just can't get myself to love not only her but anyone anymore and I even like to see her suffering. In fact, she had recently ended in a group with one of her manipulative feminist friends and entered in an abusive relationship with a guy(whom I think is a pshycopath beacuse of his say less do more attitude and lack of remorse plus callousness) and started drinking and smoking. She doesn't like her new situation and I know this beacuse I sometimes see her crying even when no one is watching, but she always wear that mask in acting like she's a pervert and actually loves being a prostitute or some sort. I, on the other hand, love seeing her feelings getting broken. I always immagine of her getting a knife in her pussy by his boyfriend, I immagine her getting shit on by women that are more attractive than her and i have this kind of voice telling to myself""she thought she finally had found the hero of her story, but stories don't always end in a good way"" and after that I get anger or anxiety outbursts, followed by me jerking off with my 16cm long penis and stroking after three minutes. I am both a sadist and a masochist and I hate it when a girl/boy cannot give me pleasure, beacuse that's literally the only  reason I have them on the first place. I like eating shit(literally), eating feet and ass or drink pee, and the hallucinations or the songs stuck I had before not only aren't there anymore, but when I hear them they don't scare me anymore and I rather see Them as a provocation and they get me to laugh like crazy. However, I also like woman deep throating my long pines until they suffocate or find their pines from pussy to come Out of their ears, and throughout all of that, my heart has a really strange reaction and it's the only real time it beats up really strong. Anywho, i truly don't feel remorse for anyone except for her, and I'll admit this situation is sending me crazy mad. She needed someone to protect her, and instead she gets someone fucking around with her freaking emotions and even threatening of beating her up, to the point where sometimes my old self comes back and I start crying and hallucinating. She really had talent in everything she did, she was a man's dream, but this monster that I have inside truly doesn't stop his desire of seeing the world burn for anything and It's always the same story. She makes a positive comment, I answer with a fake narcisistic answer I don't agree with(NO, I DO NOT think I am superior to others and am not narcisistic, I see myself as a a virus and get pleasure out of it) gets me to feel really awkward, and I repeat that I have no empathy for no one except her, not even my family or friends. We were both raised up with the same problems, we could've started up a new beginning togheter and instead we argue like hypocritical monsters eating each other out and instead she gets an ugly spider who slowly poisons her from the inside, and this goes on from three fucking years! I can't stand this anymore, I just want her to be happy! I went to therapy, professional pshycologist and shit but nothing, I'm a lost cause! I just want to See the world burn, and I don't think I will be stopped anytime soon....
Edit: oh, and I forgot to add, when people get mad at me for something I did wrong, I just answer them with weird facial expressions, words that do not make any sense or instinctive rage animal noises like the noise of a pissed off lion. Sometimes I also do crazy eyes, and I immagine the most sadistic shit I'd ever do to people such as taking off their body skins or ripping off their eyes with my fingers(I almost ripped my friend's noise off cause he got me pissed once).
Edit 2: I'm also really good at acting like a normal person and being manipulative(I talked perfect English on my Canadian teacher and tricked her into believing I actually had done my homeworks).
Edit 3: while I don't have any empathy, I do feel moderated anxiety in dangerous situations though.
Edit 4: sometimes I have the noise of guns when they shoot stuck in my head and also heavy metal songs.
Edit 5: and I do manipulate people to get what I want outta them if it's gonna benefit me.",01Jan2020,1
38,"I know alcohol is a depressant, but i don't have a good understanding of alcohol.

I got drunk exactly a year ago (4 or 5 shots) but i was fine afterwards.

I got drunk 3 days agos for the second time and had 8-11 shots. I puked, remember pretty much everything as far as i can tell, and my heart was racing the entirety of the next day, but i didn't feel awful or anything except for feeling tired. But ever since i have felt depressed, and sad. 

For the past year I've been struggling with an eating disorder/ocd and believe I developed anxiety in the second half of the past year as a result (hormones? I lost my period too (but also, ocd is kind of already an anxiety thing so i dont know)). I also used to self harm when i was younger (13-15) and im feeling in the same headspace again as i was at the time, except i know better i guess. But it's tempting.

I am 18.

I have just felt despondent and i hate that i can't help it and want to know if the drinking is what i can point to as a cause, but i have a history of mental health issues, so i dont know. I just want someone to reassure me that it was probably just the drinking, if it really was, and that this funk will pass.

43,"I used to cut myself almost daily. The last time I had cut myself was February 12th, 2019. For ten months I was able to ignore the urge, but then I fucked up. I’ve been having nightmares lately, so bad to the point I don’t wanna sleep. So instead of sleeping I stay up and just think. And when I think too much I make myself upset and get the urge to do it. 
I gave in and cut myself again, hoping the urge would go away if I just did it once, but it just reminded me how good it felt and instead of becoming a slip up, it turned into a relapse. I did it again the next day and the next, and I just am so mad at myself. The nightmares haven’t gone away and I’m falling into a shitty mental state again. Back in November 2018 I tried to kill myself because I was in such a bad place, and I’m scared I’ll get there again.
I’m terrified of doctors so going to the psychiatrist just makes me feel worse. Plus I don’t have the money for it. I want to at least tell a friend. I recently moved across the state and none of my new friends know I used to cut and about my bad mental health.

44,"I am perfectly normal mentally or I used to think... in around November I developed some sort of feeling that would drive me insane. That feeling would be trigged by me imagining a number two mechanical pencil lead dragging vertically across a piece of paper on a hard wooden table or surface. As a student, I hear the sound often. Not only was it the sound that irritated me but the physical image that accompanies the sound. I had always dreaded the sound. That visual footage would appear in my brain at least three times an hour for 3 weeks and I would grind my mouth and try to forget about it. I disposed of all my mechanical pencils thinking it would aid the dissolution of the terror. I would often write in pen and press down hard, as I generally like the texture of writing in pen and the delicate ink. I almost always use a pen, I would rather not write than write with a mechanical pencil or full pencil. The thought of the mechanical pencil grinding vertically on paper on hard surfaces would drive me mad and did for nearly a month. I almost hurt myself one day where I would keep attacking my body. I eventually stopped thinking about. Recently I have developed a new dreadful feeling, toilet paper. I have always hated the soft texture of the outer exterior of an entire roll of toilet paper. Not the individual layered strings that you roll out, but when the toilet paper is on the outer shelf of the cardboard roll and you grip the exterior to change it or give it to a family member. I always hold a complete toilet paper roll by putting two fingers inside the cardboard roll and extending my fingers inside. I would use that method to distribute or change rolls, I would never touch the dreadful outsides of the roll. Recently, this December I developed the terrorizing thought of touching the outsides of the toilet paper roll. It drives me mad every time I think of it. I will be doing something semi-productive and the thought would appear.  I have noticed that applying lotion to my hand or wetting my hand and then facing my fear and compressing and grasping the soft outsides of the toilet paper roll helps. To note, applying lotion to my hand also helped me get rid of the grim mechanical pencil image. But being winter and all, my hands are awfully dry rather frequently (however many say my hands are always dry year-long). The past week, I have had a headache. My life is on loop. The image of my dry hand touching the soft toilet paper roll appears in my mind and I immediately must rise and apply lotion or mentally and physically recoil until insanity. This has been going on every 30 minutes on average or every 15 minutes when I’m not engaged in a serious mind focusing activity. I cannot do this anymore. After doing some WebMD-style searching on Reddit, I have found maybe it could be a sensory disorder. As I am writing this, come to think of it, I do not like the feeling of dry towels, stacks of paper, cardboard boxes, Kleenex tissues especially, etc.  I know that there are more like me, I don’t know what to do though because this isn’t something that is widely known It will end up driving me to psychiatric hospitals if I don’t end this end-able disorder quickly.

45,"I first want to start off saying I don't know if this belongs on this subreddit(if it doesn't someone let me know) Secondly, sorry for any mistakes (currently typing this on mobile.) and thirdly, this might be triggering I have no clue so proceed with caution. 

I'm tired of the constant abuse from my dad and brother(16). My dad has been abusive my whole life, he's a narcissist, a hypocrite, and manipulative. My little brother has picked up the same traits, my older brother(25) and I(21F) had tried  for years to get him on the right track, to be nothing like my dad. But, we knew years ago it was too late. My dad has abused everyone including his little ""mini me."" Mentally, emotionally, and physically. 

My childhood was fucked and seemed to get worse as I grew up because instead of the abuse from one person, now it was two people. It hasn't stopped. My dad loves to threaten with ""beating me"" or ""kicking me out"" and my brother loves to tell me to ""kill myself"" or ""slit my wrists more."" My mom gets treated the same way, but my dad threatens her with ""hurting her again"" or ""divorce"" and just nasty insults. My brother loves to repeat the shit he says to her. My mother is so far down the rabbit hole of manipulation that she still loves my dad, because he goes from ""Fuck you, I wish I never married you"" to ""I love you with all my heart"" and does things for her. And once again, I get treated like that too, he'll say ""I've always wanted a daughter"" and ""I would do anything for you."" They both (father and brother) love to tell me how worthless/lazy I am. 

Also, yes I've been to therapy and I still see my psychiatrist/take medications, but it doesn't help with receiveing constant abuse. My anxiety and depression is off the charts (I've always had bad anxiety from a very young age btw) and everytime they do this shit I want to hurt myself. I wish I could move out, but I currently don't have a job and I'm too fucked up to even try to get one. 

The only thing that makes me feel better is when my boyfriend is around. He calms me down and makes living in this house bearable. But, as soon as he leaves, it's like the curtains come falling down and I'm back into hell that's in my brain. Also, I feel so bad for him because I pour all this this shit onto him and he gets to deal with the aftermath. The irritability, the tears, etc. I feel horrible because his house is just as bad.

52,"I’ve been journaling since September of my freshman year of college, and for my final couple of pages I did a recap of my decade.

All the sudden all these memories good and bad flooded into my mind. My 8 year old self who was depressed but didn’t understand it yet and just wanted to love life, to my 13 year old self who was battling shit for the first time by myself

To my 15 year old self going away for high school and felt like everything was crashing down and having no familiar face to talk to... not that I would probably talk to a familiar face

To my current 18 year old self who had the shittiest first semester of college ever.

This December break I felt I was doing well. Probably because I didn’t do anything and just hung around with myself.

But now I’m seeing all these New Years parties with people from my grade and I very much could have been invited, I live close, and there’s people there who I thought I considered close if not best friends, but nope.

And I know it’s the smallest thing because so many other people weren’t there, but they could have gotten invited and just declined, but I didn’t even get anything.

And then my mind just went to, “what if I just died and then they wouldn’t have to deal with me” “what if no one had to deal with the burden I am” I don’t enjoy myself at school. I have no friends, I have no support system, I have nothing.

I honestly didn’t think I’d make it this far, and one of the things I tried to do is think of where I could imagine myself in 5 and 10 years, and I just don’t. I don’t see myself with a family or friends, I just think of darkness and no future.

I really just don’t want to deal with anything anymore.

I was at a high and now it all just came crashing down.

I’ve always wondered what it’d be like if I wasn’t here. If I did how people would respond. All the people who were assholes to me would probably post about me and act like they knew me.

I always found it funny in year books how people would be like, “I love how positive you always were” like,  no not really, just shows how much you don’t know me.

But I never actually thought about doing the action until now. And just realizing how much people probably wouldn’t give a flying shit.

Roughly two years ago, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. It was a rough ride, but for a while I genuinely felt happier and productive after therapy and such.

Because of this, it really upsets me when I see people faking mental illness for cool points, knowing there are so many people have to trudge through this gross sludge of feelings that they can't control.

I guess I'm in the demographic of people who fake(or at least are made fun of for faking) mental illness. Recently my head has been particularly uncomfy, which has me questioning my mental state and such. Since my peers are associated with faking these kinds of things, part of me is worried I am too. Granted, I bottle everything in out of fear, I feel like these bad thoughts and breakdowns are just for attention.

After I completed my therapy, I guess I kinda just accepted myself as ""fixed"" and that I just couldn't be depressed anymore, which I guess fuels my confusion.



ps:sorry for the bad formatting, i just needed to spit my thoughts",01Jan2020,1
64,"I can’t tell if this is normal, from what I’ve heard having mood swings like this isn’t normal. At first I thought it was psychosis because of the paranoia so I started a thread in the psychosis subreddit and a lot of people said it sounds like anxiety or mania/hypomania.

I’m honestly just concerned, I can’t see my doctor for 2 days and I really don’t have the ability to ween myself off of it. So I guess I’ll ask in here what you guys think?

Today I took notes on the moods that I experienced all in order

I started out the day very depressed and I was like that for most of the day, then around 11:00 I got super hyper like I was all over the place, my thoughts were rapid fire, my parents were telling me my mood was weird. 1:00 I started to get really irritable but also a little insane, like I was screaming at people, laughing hysterically when I got mad etc. Then I fell asleep.

Is this normal? Is this the process of my moods stabilizing? What do you guys think?",01Jan2020,1
65,"I’ll talk about each issue that keeps cycling my mind, and the suicidal stuff comes at the end.

For all of 2019, And part of 2018, I decided to quit public school in hopes of it making life easier as a homeschool student. It did for my academic, however, my mental health has worsened to the point of suicidal thoughts.

I just turned 18 two weeks ago, and I’ve been in constant fear of fucking up. I don’t drink alcohol due to alcoholics, I don’t smoke weed, I don’t even smoke cigarettes. I’m terrified my family will kick me out if I mess up in the slightest. They preach that they won’t since my whole family has lived here for most of their lives, and only two of us moved out. The fear is instilled in me, though. I keep waking up everyday fearing for the day they stop caring, and I struggle more. I love my family, and they haven’t given me reasons for wanting to kick me out but, I just can’t seem to keep the idea out of my head.

Homeschooling helped me academically but, I already missed the deadline for the rest of the year as a homeschooled student. My family bought me everything to go back this January, Im terrified. I have never been bullied but, my self esteem has worsened to the point where I gained more weight in the year, I can’t stop acknowledging it. I ask for ways to lose weight but, I am terrified of a job and can’t bring myself to go to an interview, and my family won’t buy me just a few things to help me jump start a diet. They didn’t before I was 18, and they won’t now. I understand they aren’t obligated, even though they said they would if I considered a diet. I can’t go back to school because my mind thinks “you’re disgusting, fat, ugly, your old friends won’t talk to you because you gained weight.” 

My boyfriend and I have been having issues, and I don’t want to break it off because I know it’s due to my lack of communication. I dealt with verbally abusive, and toxic relationships that any form of affection is hard for me to comprehend. I can’t figure out how to go about relearning how to hold a conversation if my mind goes blank, or I think I’m talking too much. The bigger issue about this is we are hitting our 3 year mark in March. 3 years and this first year I haven’t been able to figure myself out, nor talk to anyone properly. I can talk in group forms because everyone else talks first, yet I can’t talk to my own boyfriend.

Lastly, I’m suicidal. I don’t yearn for suicide, I just feel like I would be best suited dead, not by murder but by hanging, or something. I’m not scared that I’ll inflict pain because, I know I won’t. I wouldn’t do that because I fear the aftermath, I fear what my family will see. However, I do wish I was alone so it’d be easier. I hope things get better for me.

TDLR; Constant fear of being kicked out now that I’m 18, despite not causing issues/problems. Homeschooling didn’t fix my problems, they worsened. My boyfriend and I lack communicated due to my insecurities. I’m suicidal but, wouldn’t want to hurt myself, and don’t yearn for it; although if I was homeless, alone, and forgotten about, I’d do it.

ALSO: I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety issues for a long ass time, anxiety prevents me from even asking for help in most cases.",01Jan2020,1
66,"I have a girl friend in my friend group that I really like. And in the most cheesiest way; she lights up my life whenever she's around. We don't even need to talk and I already cheer up. I have depression and a form of cyclothymia. And when I'm real down she, without knowing, gets me out of them real quick. 
I really want to open up more to her and off course hope that a relationship is possible, but I'm struggling with two things.

1. I've always felt that I don't deserve love, and I know that I shouldn't think that but I still do.
2. I'm afraid of sounding too clingy/pathetic if i want to talk about how much she helps me and such.

68,"i’ve been consistently depressed for 3 almost 4 years now and anxious my whole life. medications haven’t been helpful and neither has therapy. therapy doesn’t work when you have selective mutism, even when it’s a therapist that works specifically with selective mutism. i even went to a camp for selective mutism but it didn’t help. i haven’t been to therapy for 2 weeks cause of christmas and my dad is in the process of looking for a new one which takes forever. 

i’m 16 and basically a highschool dropout. i started homeschool this year and haven’t done any work. i don’t have any friend, not even online. i don’t have any hobbies. i just scroll through my phone all day. i’ve tried drawing, instruments, reading, anything but it doesn’t interest me.

i’ve told my dad and brother everything there is to know about me. i’m super open but it doesn’t help at all. it doesn’t get me nowhere. there’s nothing they can do and i have nobody else to go to. 

mental hospitals don’t seem like they’d be helpful, especially with my anxiety, ocd, and selective mutism.  i’m used to everyday being the same. waking up at 1pm and showering, i can’t go without a shower. then the rest of the day just fades away. also i can’t be without my dad or brother for more than an hour unless i’m home alone. 

besides i’m not bad enough to go to a mental hospital. the worst i do is scratch my arm with a paper clip nightly, it doesn’t even go deep so i usually don’t bleed. i tried a razor back when i was 13 but i barely scratched the surface and had a panic attack. everything gives me a panic attack. like today i had 3 small sips of beer and was absolutely freaking out (i’ve only drank a sip before and had the same reaction.) 

i do want to die but i don’t have the courage to do it. hell i can’t be in a crowded area without panicking how am i gonna ever kms (i know those aren’t related but point is i’m a pussy.) i’m just stuck like this forever

i don’t have any friends but there’s a few people on twitter that occasionally like my tweets and i’ll like theirs, it feels like a fake friendship. someone responded to one of my rants on there last night and i broke down crying cause i really love that person (Platonically.) When I get responses on reddit I usually feel nothing because it doesn’t feel genuinely but on there from them? It really made my night last night. It helped me get to sleep.

73,"I will describe what I believe are my symptoms and get your input on whether it's a disorder and if so, what.

I regularly become consumed by an idea and can't focus on normal everyday tasks like my job because I am so obsessed with researching or thinking about it. A couple of examples:

One topic that regularly consumes the entirety of my attention is retirement and other investing or personal finance. I get caught in a loop where I am concerned I am saving enough for retirement, and will build spreadsheets to calculate how much I will save by my retirement age, based on current saving rates and a prediction of investment returns. I will play out different scenarios, adjusting my saving rates or rates of return and other variables. I will read every blog or website about retirement investing and play with retirement planning tools. Alternatively, I will obsess about my mortgage payments, seeing how many extra principle payments will help me pay off the mortgage early, and how much I would save overall. Those are only two examples of finance related obsessions consume me regularly.

Alternatively, I will obsess about something that I am interested in buying, spending hours reading reviews or finding the best of a type of thing. The latest in terms of this is straight razors and straight razor shaving. I have spent hours and days looking for different kinds of straight razors, comparing options, reading about shaving techniques, stropping techniques and honing techniques. A couple of months ago it was similar with shoes, looking for the perfect pair of boots and weighing whether or not or when to buy them, which ones to get, and reading up on men's style.

While all of this is going on I struggle to focus on anything else, like work or social relationships. Even when I am not laser focused on some triviality like those described above, I often struggle to focus on important things. Is it OCD, ADD, both, or something else?",01Jan2020,1
74,"Hi all,

I hope you’ll entertain a post in which I vent about stuff I don’t know how to say to any one in person and that I’ve never said to anyone before. :)

I’m a 24-year old male college student in graduate school and I feel like I have become *extremely* socially withdrawn in the past two years or so. 

I used to pretty actively post (*at least* a few times a week) to social media and engage with friends on sites like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, but I find that I’ve become less and less interested in posting any sort of material whatsoever. I still actively use these sites to see *other* people’s posts and to keep up with news and what not, but I seem to have no interest in sharing anything of myself. As an example, I have stopped posting to my Facebook and Instagram altogether and have reached a tweet rate of about &lt; 10 tweets/year over the last two years.

This may sound silly and like a non-issue, but it also seems to be affecting me in a similar manner when having conversations in person or having an open-style discussion in groups. I often find that I listen and allow the other person(s) to speak *much* more than I do. This results in a lot of, what feel like, one-sides conversations. I dislike this about myself.

The weird thing is that I *am* interested in contributing to the conversation most of the time. I just can’t bring myself to it. I definitely think that I’m opinionated, so it’s not as if I’m just lacking thoughts on things. 

I do tend to do a lot of self-criticism. I would say that it is not uncommon for me to remember things I said years ago and think about how stupid I was to say it or to remember the ridicule I might’ve felt at the time. 

I will often consider what the value added is to a conversation when I am thinking about contributing a particular piece of information. Most of the time I decide that what I have to say is not relevant or important and so I say nothing instead. I’ll acknowledge what was said, maybe nod my head, give a generic response, and kind of just move on.

I am seriously concerned that this is affecting my professional life as well. I’m working in a science-related field with some of the brightest people I have ever met in my life. Part of communicating and, in general, *doing* science effectively involves understanding that *words matter.* When describing or trying to apply our understanding of physical phenomena, you have to be precise. Every day, you have to be careful to say one thing and not the other because the other is not correct and is not what you are trying to say. This forces me to think a lot before speaking and writing. 

Over the course of this post, I have deleted and rewritten words many, many times. I suppose this is pretty normal in the writing process and maybe I shouldn’t read into it too much, but sometimes I just wish I could say or write what I mean without having to put in all the mental energy to think about how what I said can be misconstrued or how it is not really what I mean. I don’t know. It feels like communicating what I want to say can be extremely difficult. I just wish it was easier I guess.

I didn’t really write this with the intent to elicit any sort of response (not that I wouldn’t read or consider any). I figured it would hopefully, somehow, be helpful to myself if I just wrote it down and posted it somewhere anonymously. So for anyone who did spend their time reading my nonsensical and unnecessarily lengthy post, thank you. Hope you have a great day. :)",01Jan2020,1
75,"So I (18M) saw the New Year in crying in my friend’s car outside the party that I was attending. I don’t know why, someone made a slightly unkind comment about me I think and then it all went downhill from there. For the past three days I have been severely depressed, thinking about death a lot, but thought it was maybe because I was lonely and hadn’t seen my friends for a while. But I saw them last night and even then I just couldn’t hold it together. I’m just so sad all the time, not even for a particular reason. And I’m also not very well-liked by many people and always feel like even my friends secretly don’t like me. So that doesn’t help.

My anxiety and depression is not a conversation starter, nor are my surgeries, or the time someone broke into my closet. Those pieces of information are for me to dish out when I feel comfortable or when I want to.

I think I should also mention that I do have clinical depression and I'm taking medication for it. The meds seemed to be working like 2 weeks ago, so idk if it's to do with those. Also the depression manifests in a weird fucking way, since I never feel sad, haven't been suicidal, and only rarely feel like I'm a failure. Sadness seems to be a main symptom and in my ~6 years dealing with this shit, I've never (that I can remember) felt unexplainably sad. Back to my main point of being tired of life. I'm really struggling to find a reason to do the school assignments I've been given for break.

I have suffered with mental health issues for a number of years. I'm taking 60mg Fluoxetine daily to support the depression, but recently I have been experiencing anxiety attacks. The first one was so intense an ambulance was called because I thought I was having a heart attack. 

I also have two intrusive thoughts. The first is around taking a knife to my wrist but my main one involved hanging myself. Now, I do not believe these are suicidal thoughts because there is no intention to act on them. But when I'm under pressure these thoughts increase and I have had to phone crisis lines once or twice.

Not because I am 'up to my eyes in debt' or anything like that, but because it will take me so long to pay it off and because I've let it build up so recklessly. There is a huge feeling of regret and a sense of doom.

92,"Hi everyone,

I've (M24) been struggling with depression, anxiety and ADHD since my early teens. Because of this, finding friends and creating meaningfully connections with people around me was always difficult. Consequentially, I developed a habit of spending most of my free time by myself, completely submerged in whatever obsession I could find to basically distract myself from the fact that I feel fundamentally flawed and incapable of living in a community. By having spent literally (tens of) thousands of hours by myself, I have noticed that it is becoming increasingly difficult to communicate my thoughts and feelings, making it even more difficult to reconcile and reintegrate myself into society. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night I took LSD with two of my best friends. The evening started out great, lots of laughing and giggling, generally speaking I felt connected and part of the group. At a certain point I stated noticing that I was in a constant state of confusion and communication was getting increasingly difficult. I felt like my attention span was getting shorter and shorter, making me jump inconclusively between impulses and stimuli. This eventually culminated in me not being able to communicate with even with myself, let alone the people surrounding me. This slowly but surely alienated me from the group dynamic, and eventually I decided to leave, seeing as I was causing strange vibes in the group dynamic. I spent the rest of the night reflecting about the evening and my life in general. Despite the fact that I had been the one who decided to leave the group, I can't help but feeling a feeling of abandonment and disinterest from the people I regarded as being my closest friends. A sort of feeling of: ""You do you"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I've never felt so alone in my entire life. I feel like the few friends I have are slowly looking at me like I'm insane and I feel like I'm slowly losing touch with reality.

94,"First of all, happy new years everyone, hope everyone is getting through, maybe hungover from last night's party ;)

Anyhow, it's definetly a new year, but for me it hasn't exactly started as a happy one.

I spent my new years with my family, as any 19 year old should do when they still live with them. And my older sister got drunk and she passionately talked about how grateful she is for our parents, the opportunities they've given and how supportive they are despite the Filipino stereotype of wanting their kids to be nurses. But letting us pursue what we want, such my older brother in smart home installation and home renovation, my older sister with baking and entrepreneurship, me with robotics engineering, and my little sister who is yet to find a career goal but is still supported in everything she does, art, music, teaching.

What got to me was the way she said it. She was speaking out to the world, but to a room of just 4 other people, my mum, dad, little sister and I. She kept screening and crying that she is do grateful, that she does all these things to show her gratitude, and asking the world why people don't take these opportunities their parents give to their kids. But since she was speaking to us the family, it seemed more like her ranting that me and my little sister don't do enough to show gratitude.

There is no doubt in my mind that my parents sacrificed alot for their kids. My dad used to make a 6 digit salary, my mum had a career working at a bank and handling stocks. They gave it up to bring us to Canada when we were young (I was 7/8, currently 18) just so we could get an education from the land of opportunity. My mum and dad worked themselves to the bone to feed us, clothe us, and support the family off of minimum wage jobs since nobody wanted to hire them due to their degrees being from the Phillipines. 

My older sister kept going on about how ""If you love your parents why the fuck don't you do anything around the house?!"", ""Can't you see you have awesome amazing parents?!, ""You should understand the hardship they went through"", ""you don't understand because you don't talk to mammy about her problems"".

As if my sister has the moral high ground for having more appreciable acts of gratitude, she works around the house, she has a job so she can support the family etc etc. While for me, I'm a year behind in highschool and I'm trying to finish courses that I need to get into my program. My gratitude comes from me working on school, it comes from me graduating on stage, it comes from me being able to hold my diploma for my parents on time, despite still not being able to finish my courses to go to uni straight away. My gratitude comes from me being here, it comes from me waking up in the morning and fighting the thoughts that festered in my mind for years until 2018 when I attempted suicide. My gratitude is fighting one of the hardest raid bosses, myself and my thoughts. My gratitude comes from standing up for my family if people speak down about them, my gratitude comes from standing up to my older sisters abusive boyfriend and telling him to leave our lives when she is not strong enough to tell him to leave, my gratitude comes from being beat up from said boyfriend while protecting my sister. My gratitude comes from taking my opportunities and getting my post secondary bachelor's and hopefully masters as well in engineering. My gratitude comes from still being here, when all hope is lost, when I feel I can't get up anymore, gratitude is looking at god and saying ""Go fuck yourself"" for making my life feel like a living hell, staring into myself and fighting the temptation to end it all again, my gratitude is being able to look around the abyss that is my mind and despite all the shit that's here or the lack there of, staring into it and saying I have hope.

To hear my older sister, my best friend since the day I was born, the person who took care of me for a year when the government tried to seperate my family after my suicide attempt, the person I cried to about having to lock myself in the washroom an entire night to escape thoughts, the person who cried with me on the balcony before I made another attempt by jumping, the person who cried with me waiting for the police to come when my face was bruised and my shirt halfway torn and battered. Of all people to hear them say ""you are not enough"". I understand what she was saying, and I know she didn't mean it the way she said it, especially considering she was drunk off of a bottle of martini and glasses of wine.

I just needed to get this off my chest. It's hard to hear for me, that I need to do more when my 110% is going into bettering myself, rather than 110% going into staying alive cause mum would be sad, putting the effort into wanting to be alive not because other people would be sad, but just so you can have something to say when people ask ""where do you see yourself in 5 years"" and drawing a blank because you honestly can't see a future with you still in it.

I guess the point of this post was to rant, but I wish everyone an amazing 2020, don't let anyone ever say you're not doing enough. Being here is enough, seeking help is enough, waking up even if you get out of bed 5 hours later is enough. Don't let people think you're ingracious, your gratitude to life comes from everything you do. It definetly is a new year, be it happy or not, atleast it's another year. 

Cheers my friends, and Godspeed",01Jan2020,1

I’ve tried listening and rationalising with her, suggesting she seeks professional help, tough love etc. However more and more I find myself frustrated that she is throwing herself a pity party and her woe is me attitude. I have very little patience for it these days, as I feel it’s something that should have been addressed by now. Does anyone feel like this? Are there any suggestions out there of how to deal with it in a more sympathetic way? I feel like I have been the grown up in this relationship got a very long time.

So believe me, she’s tried EVERYTHING at this point and it still flares up and sometimes it’s 2-5 days she will go without sleep. Laying down, she’s anxious, has an elevated heart rate, and has tried at least ambien, Remeron, risperdal, xanax, and klonopin which work for the first couple times but either stop working or are hazardous (benzos) to take all the time. She had some bloodwork done recently which showed a mildly elevated TSH  so she has an endocrinologist appt Friday. That’s like her only area she hasn’t developed yet for this. The reaction I described isn’t inherently about trauma, it’s JUST about sleep since it’s such a huge problem but she has a diagnosis of PTSD and exhibits all the symptoms.

Here's the problem : I've been with her 2 months and after that I've suddenly stopped loving her!! Since it couldn't make sense that I could ever instantly stop loving her like that, I began to look for what could've go wrong. Here it is, she is very unsecure about everythings! She was always thinking that one day I would go away, that she wasn't pretty and lots of other things. So she was always texting me when I woke up, before going to school, in the bus, (not at school because she is there), she was texting me in the after school bus, in the evening and a late night call after that. So that made me feel like my liberty was going away. There was other things too but anyway... So I decided to break up with her. But now its been 2 months and we are in a weird situation.

104,"Have you tried stitching for mental health?

Starting 2019 I was depressed, struggling with anxiety insomnia and having several panic attacks a day. I was at my lowest. and I thought that I did not have the drive to get out of there, of that unhealthy mental space.
For the first couple weeks of 2019, I was suicidal. I felt like I was not worth being alive. I just wanted to stop existing, what the hell did it even mean? Disappear? Stop being in pain, constant pain? Stop hurting people around me? But I was too scared (or maybe too brave) to actually do it, to let go…

So, I stuck around, I decided to just do it one day at the time. Worse case scenario I will let go tomorrow. (Yes I procrastinated even that).

But how can I take my mind off it? I needed something to keep me somehow busy without giving me the energy/space to get into my dark side. At that time, I remember browsing through Pinterest for easy craft to learn and I stumbled upon embroidery.

I have never done embroidery before but I loved how from basic material ( thread and fabric) you can have a beautiful art piece. The process seemed soothing and it required enough focus to keep that weird mind of mine busy. I started stitching!

For the first weeks I keep stitching on a big piece of fabric random pattern all colorful (first image). I did not know what I was doing.I just stitched, stitched and stitched.
Then, I got more curious about other techniques, other designs and I started expressing what I was feeling/ seeing/ experiencing through fabric/thread art. At this point I was just doing it for myself, it became my healing therapy.

I found creating my own embroideries so helpful in aiding with my recovery that it led me to start an instagram page Khyoott

I am not 100% okay now. As we all know it mental heath is a constant struggle but I learnt to deal with my symptoms in a smoother way. I know that sometimes I just have to embrace that dark space and that it is not gonna be a constant state. The sun will rise tmr and if it doesn't it is okay it will rise the next week/month/year... There is always hope!

I can't stop thinking. I try to dull my mind by watching mindless YouTube videos but as soon as I put my phone down, the thoughts are there. I can't focus on other people's conversations because I analyse my body so much.
I try to work out, go for runs, dance, blast music, drink alcohol, I also went for a drive in an attempt to think about something else ... nothing works. I can't think about anything else. I've tried meditation, yoga ... I'm in CBT, it doesn't work. Ahhhhhh idk what to do ):",01Jan2020,1

109,"None of you probably remember the post I made a couple of days before I was emitted. I made a post which entailed my desires to cut my cheeks off as well as my plan for how to do it and when I was going to do it. I did do it, but I did not succeed. None of my blades were sharp enough to get through the tough layers, so instead I lost my temper and slashed and slashed as hard as I could all over my face. Yes, there was a lot of blood, I even stained my favourite hoodie and my fingers were stained for a couple of days. It felt great to do it and I would love to do it again and hopefully succeed the next time round.

This was late at night on Monday the 18th November, after I did it, I plopped down on the couch and fell asleep. I woke up to a loud ""HOLY FUCK"" which came from roommate, he asked what happen and I skipped on the details, but he got the gist, he then convinced me to sign myself in voluntarily to the hospital since if I didn't I would somehow be forced to go in.

I called up my councillor and they sorted it out for me and got me a bed in the ward. I drove myself there with a scarf wrapped around my face for obvious reasons. They brought me in and had me see a doctor to check if I needed stitches. A really nice guy then introduced me to the ward and told me how things worked. 

I have been in here ever since. It's not all that bad and the therapists and physicists do a much better job with helping than any of my councillors ever did. The nursing staff are also very kind and help me with a lot of stuff. Before you ask, yes I still want to cut them off, but there's nothing here I can do it properly with.

I have no one really to share all this with so I thought this would be the best place, especially since I have posted about stuff like this before.

I never do any new years resolutions usually, but I want for this year to sometimes feel true happiness.

I think the word I'm looking for to describe my feeling is apathy toward anything, like nothing really matter, like it's all just a game/movie someone else is watching.

111,"My partner and I (33) got into a fight last night (Happy New Year!).  He is not clinically diagnosed with depression, anxiety or any other mental health condition and is not on meds.

We have been together for less than a year, but the perpetual dark cloud over his head is his deep rooted unhappiness for his job.  I am starting to worry and wonder if it's really his job or if it's something deeper than that.  

I'm trying to be as supportive as I can, but my resources and patience are running thin.  I'm putting my own needs aside for him, but it's beginning to take a toll on me and this kind of came out last night.

I'm a very active and overall happy person, and yesterday it was a hassle and a minor fight to get him outside on a hike with me. I am happy to go and do sports and activities alone, so when I say I'll just go on my own, he insists he wants to come too. But in a way that isn't without tension.  Last night I knew he would want to go straight home after work- but it was NYE. As a single person I would go find a party and welcome the new year, but I know he doesn't like parties.  So I thought we would drive down to see the fireworks after he was done work (11:00pm), and I also did not want to sit at home.  He came with me, but grudgingly and was grumpy the entire time.

I've been putting up with this because I know he's dealing with a lot of his own issues. But it's starting to suck the fun and zest out of my life.  He sleeps until 12pm everyday, I see him enough for breakfast and then he goes to the gym and goes to work, then I don't see him until 10:30pm or 11pm at night.

I know that someone who is depressed and dealing with mental health can have extreme difficulty just getting out of bed in the morning.  I said some hurtful things last night, but I don't want to spend my life like this.  I'm someone who's out and about  getting things done and looking for my next adventure. I have a positive outlook on life, and I love living.  

I'm not sure how to deal with this, I love him and when we have good times they're great- but I'm not sure how fair it is for me to feel like I'm in a relationship alone.

120,"My teenaged son has a friend who is about 17 1/2. He is basically homeless and tries to find friends houses to crash at each night. He has a sibling in the area (who is a young adult) but his parents live far away and apparently living with them is not an option. He asked me to take him in and my heart aches for him but i don't know what to do. He has some mental health issues (bipolar, odd, depression, anxiety) and smokes pot and vapes. I have younger children living in the house who adore him, and my older teen has some similar issues. So far he has been respectful when he's here and better behaved than my son, tbh.

When I talked with him I got mixed messages. He really wants a family and a mom, but he also doesn't want to give up his lifestyle of hanging out with friends all day and smoking pot. He is almost 18 so I realize I can't exert as much control as I would with a younger child. I told him my criteria for him staying here would be that he'd have to be in counseling for his mental health issues and he'd have to be either employed or in school. (In addition to following house rules.) I don't think he's able to abide by that. My daughter is making me feel bad for setting these boundaries because the effect is him probably being on the street. She thinks I should just let him crash here and live his life as long as he is staying out of trouble (which he does) and follows my house rules while he's here (which he also has so far.) He does want to get a job and has asked for help with that, and I would definitely never give him money directly but I would be giving him food and shelter.

Meanwhile other adults think I'm crazy for even considering taking him in. I feel sad that it is so easy for everyone to turn their backs and justify it in one way or another.

I know the boundaries I've set are reasonable, but they also seem elitist. How is a kid who has never had guidance or support supposed to suddenly jump through hoops? Especially when he is just coming to terms with his mental health issues (recently diagnosed.) He has no support and no stability.

How do I help him without enabling him? I also worry about my ability as a caregiver. I've had some life events this year and my own kids have needs that I am struggling with.

122,"It's been 2 months now since I've halted my drinking.  I needed to stop for awhile and get my head on straight.  I've been having stomach/acid reflux issues and I wanted to see if that would clear it up.  (It's helped but clearly isn't main cause) Anyway, I feel great but mostly mentally!  I was drinking with my anti-anxiety pills and I realized I've never tried them without alcohol.  My anxiety has been much better and way more manageable.  I'm able to calm it down faster and more effectively.  Also, I'm not so bloated.  I would've lost some weight but I indulged heavy in Christmas goodies.  I had alot more money to spend at Christmas and more energy to start AND finish projects I started.  The good part is very GOOD and the longer I go the happier I feel. My relationship with my man has gotten closer and better also. 

Now the bad? The explaining to friends and family.  I hate explaining myself especially numerous times.  I don't even know how to explain it because it was just something I decided to do pretty randomly and quickly.  Learning to be around drunk people is hard.  I know I was really annoying sometimes drunk but trust me, we all are.  I went to a friend's for cards and hot tubbing and it was difficult at times being sober.  People would pass me a bottle and I'd pass it along.  The constant ' oh I'm sorry! I forgot I feel bad!'.  Don't feel bad, or apologize. Just don't make it a big deal. It's ok.  For me, I don't consider myself an alcoholic.  I will probably drink again someday.  Just trying it sober for now.  I've always been into the party scene.  I still love going out and having fun.  I see this as more of a challenge than a sucky unfun thing I'm doing to myself.  

All in all, I highly recommend a sober break if you feel your life starting to revolve around alcohol more than it should.  It's hard and rough at times.

But  then after 9 or 10 months, I got to know that she was just playing with me. To be concise, she, basically, sent the same nudes to me and four others and sucked  each of us off on the same day without any of us getting to know about  others and then explained herself the next day by saying that it's *""modern multiple dating.""* And she had been doing all that long before hooking up with me.

Obviously, it broke me like hell, I was a little depressed and even cried at night thinking about my fucking fate. It wouldn't have been that upsetting if I didn't have such isolated and prison like teenage years.

But hopefully I got over it with much pain, learnt about game, developed my communication skills and completely changed myself. I am no longer a  people pleaser nor am I lonely or get upset about my life. But, as the title says, there's this one thing for which I don't have any  solution, whenever her name pops up in any conversation or situation or just when I thinking about something, I feel like I am going back to the old me. It doesn't happen that often, but when it does, it ruins my day and week and messes with my mind badly. 

I  just don't know why it happens, but if anyone has a solution or has experienced anything like this, then pls tell me what to do.",01Jan2020,1

126,"**TRIGGER WARNING: self harm and suicide mentioned.** 

For a while now, around the internet we see all of this “speak out” and “don’t be afraid to say something”, and as a whole and I absolutely support and repost about this, because there shouldn't be a stigma about mental health.

But why is it that when people do reach out, nothing happens? I'm from the UK, and in every severe example of mental health suffering I've come across, going to the doctors accomplishes nothing.  I have so many examples.

My friend, (17M) has attempted to take his own life on 2 occasions by overdose, waking up in comas. And yet he cannot afford to pay for his antidepressants because they're too expensive. Admitted to CAHMS that did absolutely nothing, with a super long waiting list, but can't afford private counselling/therapy. 

Then we have my best friend (17F) who had to go to her GP **FOUR** times before they listened to her, after describing the extent her depression and self harm effected her, and prescribed her anti-depressants, which has only made her feel worse, having only received school counselling prior. 

Then we have a family member of mine (22F) who has gone to hospital twice now due to self harm and overdose. Coming out of hospital with nothing but a few numbers and waiting lists to refer herself on to. 

The one that hurts the most is a dear friend of mine (19F) suffering with severe anxiety and depression, and unfortunately taking her own life. She spent a week in a ward, and due to the demand for facilities, got allowed home and took her own life some time after. They knew she was suffering, but let her home.

And me stressing that none of my close family and friends aren't getting the help they need, has only worsened my mental state, as well as grieving over the loss of my friend. It's an epidemic. And nothing is changing.  I'm not attacking our NHS, because it helps so many people and this country should be so grateful for the services we can get, but how can I go on, telling people to speak out when I know they'd only be worse off for it. Imagine feeling like that was your last hope, to be disregarded or completely unheard.

I just feel like a hypocrite giving out advice I know I wouldn't take, knowing that the funding isn't there and unless you're dying, no one takes you seriously.",01Jan2020,1

TW: suicide mention, bipolar disorder, depression

My boyfriend and I have been together for about 5 years. We had about a nearly half-year long breakup while we were both struggling with our mental health (I have depression, and was in the hospital for a suicide attempt, he just recently worked with a therapist that believes he may have bipolar-one disorder). After we got back together, we had both been so much better mentally and we were both ready to make a jump back into our relationship, together. There were a lot of ups-and-downs but ultimately I believe he is my soulmate, and vice-versa. I love him dearly, and am willing to be there for him through anything and everything.

That being said, while I do struggle with clinical depression, I do go to regular therapy, and have developed strong and grounded coping mechanisms. I feel a lot happier and freer with my life. My boyfriend was doing regular therapy but recently stopped. I have been urging him to continue, especially with the realization that he may have bipolar-one, but it's been increasingly difficult due to financial/life situations. The main problem is... I have NO idea how to properly be there for him when he's having an episode. He has had an alarmingly INCREASED number of manic episodes as of late, and we are afraid he may be slipping into a deeper depression because of it. He's lost motivation, and pushes me away. I try my best to talk him through his episodes, but he has difficulty with my being there with him physically and will oftentimes ask me for space. I usually oblige and will give him as long as he needs.

I don't know what else to do though - I feel like the space doesn't help that much, and there's not much else that's being done when he is having an episode. He will scream or cry, and will usually berate himself and question if he's a good person and if he even deserves me. I obviously love him much and am willing to help him through it all. I'm scared and I just want to help him but I have absolutely no therapeutic experience, nor even direct experience with a partner who has bipolar disorder. When his episodes are ""over,"" he's usually very monotone and emotionless. When he's happy, he's exuberant, vibrant, ready to take on life. The episodes are becoming more and more frequent and I just feel useless. I want to help him... any advice is greatly appreciated. I'm so worried about him and I love him so much, I want to keep urging him for therapy but right now is very difficult.

TLDR: My boyfriend may be bipolar, I'm trying to be there for him but have absolutely zero clue what to do when he's having an episode.",01Jan2020,1
128,"Hey everyone.

So this text is going to be a huge mess. I just want to write my feelings down for a bit so yeah, let‘s go:

I‘m currently 17 years old and I‘m doing an apprenticeship in a small towns community office. Before I started working I was so excited to finally leave school but after like one week of working I had a kind of breakdown and everything just got up to me. I realized that I won‘t have 14 weeks of holidays anymore, I have to work on wednesday afternoons etc. I think everyone who initially started working had that moment. The problem is that these thoughts just never stopped. Every evening I‘m afraid of the next day for no reason at all. My colleagues are mostly nice and I enjoy doing the work that I do. I somehow just can‘t get myself to actually enjoy it. I‘m pretty sad while sitting in the bus, driving to work because I think about the long day that awaits me. Once I‘m actually working, these thoughts kinda disappear because I just function somehow and do the shit that I have to do. This has been going for the past 4 months now and it‘s slowly starting to affect my mental health. I wouldn‘t say I‘m depressed, I still enjoy live and for gods sake I shouldn‘t complain. I live in a nice skiing town in switzerland and I get to do what I love most every weekend, meeting friends, skiing and just having fun but under the week, it‘s just completely different. 

Now for the actual problem. I have 2 weeks of holidays since christmas and I felt like the time went by way too quick. I did fun stuff everyday and we had an amazing new years party with my closest friends and today I had a pretty bad hangover and just thought about life the whole day. I want to enjoy the last 4 days of my holidays as much as possible but when I think about it, 4 days are nothing and it‘ll go by so quick and then life‘s back to ""shit"". I just don‘t know if its just me or if time actually goes by this fast when youre not only working all day. 
Please just talk to me because I want to get shit together and not be a kinda depressed prick when I‘m not skiing or doing stuff with friends.
Oh and I don‘t really want to quit my apprenticeship because I‘d have to wait half a year before being able to do something else.

I know that I complain about unnecessary shit while other people are actually depressed. I just have this small problem that I cant really solve so I‘d enjoy talking to other people that were in the same situation as me.",01Jan2020,1

133,"What is Online Therapy? 

Online therapy is a growing trend. According to one online service, it has grown almost 80% since 2016 with an average of 500,000 registered users. 

Online therapy is a space where you can talk to someone in confidence and work out issues you may have such as Depression, Anxiety, Stress, relationship problems, grief and much more. You can talk to the therapist either by phone, text or video chat. 

Here’s how to get started, you register on a site that employs licensed therapists and choose a therapist that you feel will fit your needs. Therapists have a profile, which will state their specialty. For instance, a therapist may state they work with the elderly or are addiction specialists. 

The Benefits of Online Therapy

Rural Areas

If you live in a rural area, for instance, you won’t have to drive 1-2 hours to a bigger city to get service. Even if you live in a more populated area, there may not be enough mental health services available. Sometimes people may have to wait months to see a therapist because of the demand for mental health services. 

Limited Access

Many individuals have limited mobility because of age or disability. Online access to a therapist gives people who may not get to an office, access to a therapist.

Ease of Use and Affordability

Being able to talk to someone in the comfort of your own home is both easy and convenient. It is much easier to talk to someone from your home then have to deal with traffic, parking and waiting to see the therapist. If you talk to a therapist from home, you are also likely to be more open with the therapist because you are comfortable in your environment. 

Online therapy rates are much less than at a tradition office. Rates vary depending on whether you talk via phone, text, or video chat. The ability to accept insurance plans depends on the state they are in and the type of insurance you have.

Reduces Stigma

Online therapy services have seen a rise in users. The people who are using online therapy more are women, Muslims, LBGTQ, minorities and Jewish. Having mental health issues is a stigma for many cultures. It may be impossible for someone to seek therapy without being looked down on or ostracized. Online therapy benefits people who are afraid to seek help, due to cultural beliefs or not wanting anyone to know they are struggling internally. 

Disadvantages of Using Online Therapy

Although online therapy is beneficial for certain people, it may not work for everyone. 

Out of State Providers

Many states have laws regarding therapists and psychologists providing services to people in states they are not licensed in. This means that if your state does not have any online therapy providers, you would not be able to use the services. If they do have providers in your state, you may not have very many choices. Laws vary from state to state.

Insurance

Some health insurance companies do not cover online mental health services. Although online rates are more affordable than traditional office visits, they may still be too expensive for some individuals.

Serious Mental Illness

An online therapist is not appropriate for someone who has a serious mental illness. People who suffer from a serious mental illness should be under the care of a psychiatrist. There are no crisis services available for online therapy, so there is no one to contact if you have experienced a setback or have suicidal thoughts.


To Sum Things Up…

Online therapy is a great alternative to traditional therapy. It can be both convenient and cost-effective. You can access an online therapist through various websites. Ecounseling has a list of the 5 best services along with an average price point, if you feel online therapy is a good fit for you, you can start looking at your options and make an informed decision.",01Jan2020,1
135,"My emotions used to be very strong, to the point I was always suicidal either out of depression or mania. Bad was horrible and good was weird and trippy.

I'm afraid of having to meet new therapists and not clicking. Then searching again. I'm afraid to fully open up. I'm afraid... I just don't know how to get over this fear. 

I will reach out to therapists, but if they don't have an appointment right away I usually stop looking. It gives me so much anxiety just to look up therapists and reach out. I go into an almost panic attack. Even just thinking about it right now is making me feel afraid. 

I don't have a general practitioner either... because between my insurance being strange about approving certain things, and doctors not wanting to see me because I'm pregnant, it gets so tedious and frustrating to find a doctor that will see me... It makes me so anxious and upset. I just don't know what to do. 

I really need to know how to get over this. I just don't know what to do. I'm just so anxious about trying to call and get appointments.

140,"Hello everyone, 

I just want to start off by saying that I do currently see a therapist and she does help me but I still struggle a lot in the in between.

I’m posting because I feel so lost all of the time. A little bit about myself: 

I’m a 25 year old male. I am overweight. I work as a High School Teacher, and I coach to sports as well. I have a a girlfriend of 6 years. I own a home, have pets, debts etc. 

What I really want to know is if anyone else shares the same feelings that I do, because honestly, the struggle has gotten pretty bad these past few years...

I think I may be depressed. I struggle with the fact that I probably am because I don’t want to be and even my therapist has told me that I should explore anti-depressants to help me. I don’t want to take them because I don’t want the side-effects and what if it makes me worse. 

I literally don’t have many feelings anymore. I know what they are and what they feel like but I don’t really get them. I seldom feel happy, excited, hopeful or loving. I often just feel sad, tired, and nothing seems to excite me anymore. I often feel as though I hate myself. I struggle to look in the mirror because let’s be honest, I’m about 5’7 and I’m overweight. I’m working on losing it but I still eat like crap and I have no motivation to do otherwise. My relationship has gone on for 6 years and we bought a house and all that. Since I’ve been living here I think it’s been bad but I know it’s not living with her because I felt like this even when I was still in college. I didn’t really do anything socially, stopped going to the football games and stuff. Spent a lot of time in my room, other than when I got into coaching, that brightened my day. I feel like most of the time that I don’t know what love feels like anymore and that I can’t put those feelings forward. I constantly worry about money. I constantly think that people are talking badly about me including the kids that I teach and that nobody really likes me at all. 

When I have to go visit my parents I get upset to leave because we live an hour away from them. I feel like I don’t see them enough and it makes me very sad because on top of all of this, I constantly worry about the fact that they’re getting older and so am I. It freaks me out to no end. I’m even almost in tears thinking about that right now. I’m not sure if I’m in love because I don’t know how it feels anymore, I hate myself and how I look (I’ve been losing my hair since high school too) and I just can’t. I literally can’t. I’m glad when she has to work late because I get to be alone at home for a little while and that bugs me too. I don’t want to feel like that. She wants to get married and I can’t even decide whether I want to because I can’t feel anything, about anything.

When I’m coaching I usually feel better but even then I’m still paranoid that I suck at it and I have a hard time taking criticism there and at work because I automatically take it personally. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I’m alone in this or not. I apologize for the long post. I just needed to vent. I just feel so trapped in my own mind.",01Jan2020,1

I told myself I'd keep taking the one depression med but I guess I mixed up my meds so much i just started forgetting to take that one too. So for like 3 weeks now I've been completely unmedicated. 

My boyfriend just cleaned our entire house while I cried in the bathroom about how much of a peice of shit I am for him having to. He works, and I dont, so it's my responsibility to keep the house in check but it's just gone to shit completely this last month. I cant get the energy to do anything.

147,"I feel... empty. 

I’ve had 4 or 5 therapy sessions.. been on serotonin for almost 3 months. Out of those 3 months I used marijuana probably 70/90 days, but I think the major reason I kept using it was because it made me feel creative again. 

I’m 24M live in my parents basement, I have a puppy that’s about 2 years old, I’m a full time real estate broker &amp; I just started a new start up for a marketing company. While these jobs can be lucrative, I’m currently sitting almost $30,000 in debt between credit cards &amp; just found out I’m getting audited by the IRS for $4,500

I started to really explore what was going on in my head because I have constant racing thoughts. One thought would turn into 20 in a matter of seconds.  And sometimes they lead to suicide ideation, I tried talking to my girlfriend at the time, but it didn’t go anywhere. We eventually broke up 2 or so weeks later. I think about her almost every day. 

I struggle with finishing things &amp; setting realistic goals in almost every aspect of my life. In business settings it’s never to make “just enough money” or anything. It’s always to be the absolute greatest at my job. I put together plans that I think are solid constantly... ways to sell 50 houses, or whatever it is. 

And I think my “condition” helps with this sometimes because I take ideas to a whole new level. 

But lately I’ve just felt empty. Not sad, not happy, I don’t get excited very often. People who meet me the first time will describe me as “the most chilled dude they know” but inside my brain is always going 100 miles per hour. 

So far my therapist &amp; medicine doctor have different ideas. Therapist thought it was a mood disorder, then a hint of bipolar (no confirmed people with bipolar in my family, but there are a few that I could see it) while my medicine doctor thinks I’m depressed. 

Also side note because if you actually read this you deserve this lol. 

But when I first started therapy... I actually didn’t know I was going to therapy. I was only there because I wanted an adderall prescription.   Of course like most, I googled my symptoms and came up with ADHD. 

So I went to the doctor, and she referred me to my now therapist. I showed up thinking I was going to a normal appointment. But suddenly someone was asking how I felt.

So I left therapy and head home. Thinking the whole way home “holy crap I need therapy?” And I get home to 4 cops outside my house &amp; my little brother on his way to the hospital for another freak out episode. 

My little brother was born with brain damage, and is essentially a 300 pound 6’ 1” 6 year old in a 21 year old body. So naturally when he throws tantrums they get super dangerous. 

To this day, no one in my family knows I’ve gone to therapy. 

BUT my little brother started to go to therapy, and he now has the same therapist....

Long post. But it felt good. I also do this really weird thing where I ramble (see this post) but it makes me feel like a freak. I always feel I have so much to say, but no one listens or no one wants to hear it.",01Jan2020,1

I told her that fear is no way to live, and while she agreed, she said that she is thankful for the fear because at least it keeps me here. She said the only good thing about the fear is that it keeps me here.

I asked her what my funeral would even be like because it's not like anyone can say ""May God bless her soul."" She said that it's true none of them can say that and believe it and that while none of my family would openly talk about that, every believer at my funeral would know where I was. When I asked what my funeral would even be like, she said that all everyone can do is say good things about me and talk about good memories. 

Apparently, all this mess I'm going through is happening for a reason. God has a plan, apparently.

149,"I am from the US. My younger sister is struggling with her mental health. She is diagnosed with a personality disorder, but it’s unspecified. Personally, there’s no doubt in my mind that she has BPD, but I’m not a medical professional so I can’t diagnose her. She attends school in a different state, and earlier this year attempted suicide. My parents flew to her apartment to spend time with her and take care of her, leaving their jobs for a month.
Prior to the attempt, she and I had a falling out. She has a tendency to get drunk and call or text me the most horrendous and offensive things about myself, and when she went too far I called her out on it (causing us to lose contact). Without me to calm her down, she eventually attempted suicide. I feel responsible every day for that, and it’s exhausting. 
Since coming home, she has been an absolute monster - her bipolar swings are intense and hard to handle. But because she presents so well in therapy, none of this is being dealt with.

I wake up with withdrawl i guess. im laying there, causally taking to my roommate still all tipsy-feeling, then a fucking bug?? comes out of my eye??? it felt like a tear, you know how tears will drip down, instead of rolling on your cheek? you know, when you have your head at a certain angle.

&amp;#x200B;

im so fucking concerned. it just happened and now im shaking and my eye hurts and feels bothered. i dont know if im shaking due to withdrawal or complete fear. the bug looked weird, like a tiny rolly polly except it was small. looked like larva with tiny legs. it dropped down outta my eye and i freaked out, making my roomate freak out. but he didnt keep the bug?? he kicked me out of his room because he thought i was on drugs and was irritated. but i done NO drugs last night nor today- only draank. i dont know if im seeing things due to withdrawal or not, i dont know if any of this is real or in my head. its so scary, how would a bug just come out like that?? it feels like theres pressure on my eye, but looking at it i cant see anything",01Jan2020,1

154,"So I grew up in a pretty unstable home situation and as a result developed some shit coping mechanisms. I'd been dealing with a lot of shit-mood swings, fear of change, terrible self esteem, the whole shebang. I've been seeing a therapist. We went through a BPD screening and I definitely have it.

I'm pretty scared. Every time I've heard about BPD it was used as an insult, or it's been a way to warn people off of a manipulative person. I don't wanna be like that. Even though I know the BPD stigma is bullshit, I'm still pretty upset. 

Does anyone have any advice?",01Jan2020,1
155,"I am unemployed, no friends, no one to talk to. I'm in debt. My husband is a raging alcoholic. He makes me feel bad for not having a job (I was working two jobs not too long ago, quit one and lost the other). I live in a very small area and I'm in the process of getting another job. I'm starting to get very depressed because my whole life I've struggled with poverty and depression. I try very, very hard. I have had many jobs in the past and I'm a hard worker. I'm loyal.  But I'm extremely shy and awkward in social situations. I've never had any friends. 

I knew my husband had problems with addiction from the start, but I was so happy for once in my life I thought someone cared about me and didn't want to be alone. I have brought up divorce before and he screams at me saying ""No one will want you, how will you support yourself etc"" 

My depression has been worsening and he pretends like I don't exist, when he gets home he sits in front of tv and drinks all night. What's worse is my 9 year old son tells me I'm worthless and I should kill myself. He says he doesn't have to listen to me, you don't have a job.

I am not a bad mother, I have done nothing to warrant that kind of response. I don't know what to do anymore. I am completely alone in the world. I have tried talking to my husband when he is sober because I am concerned that the fifth of whiskey he drinks everyday is not good for his health and told him he will develop cirrhosis or pancreatitis. He doesn't think its that big of a deal. I wish I could leave but I don't have anyone to go and no one truly cares about me. I am not a bad person, I have always tried to put my family first but they don't even love me.",01Jan2020,1

157,"High school senior here. I previously posted about possible seasonal depression and now I'm completely sure that I have it. The moment winter vacation started, I just crashed. Have only been happy a couple of times for the past two weeks. Every time I try and mention it to my mother, she writes it off as me not trying hard enough. This time specifically I mentioned that I had run out of bedding for my pet rabbit and she flipped out on me because I didn't ask her to pick some up. Called me irresponsible and after the conversation ended she started sending me job links so I can get out of the house. But the truth is, I'm terrified. Everything in the outside world freaks me the hell out. Barring the fact that I'm struggling with gender identity, there are numerous issues. I'm awful at socializing, I stutter when I speak, I worry about every single person I meet, I struggle to be happy when I'm alone, and I'm not really truly good at anything off the top pf my head. I guess the takeaway is, after this encounter with my mom, I kinda just feel like a useless person. How can I overcome this as well as my fear of leaving the comfort zone?

162,So all my life I’ve pretty much had a disconnect from society. I suffered through a very traumatic experience in my childhood. In fact it’s my first memory. Fast forward a couple years when I’m making the transition into a teenager. I was maybe 13. We moved out into the “country” complete isolation. Both of my parents worked in town and they worked a lot . I would be left alone all day. Nobody to talk to. Ever since then I began to change. We eventually moved out but the effects were there. I would barely talk in fact I became socially awkward. It became hard for me to make friends. I just didn’t know how to act around people. About 4 years ago (I’m now 19) I noticeably began having mental issues. I was completely fine not sad or anything but for some I started having random thoughts of suicide. And other darker thoughts. I would randomly have voices in my head that would sometimes even argue. It wasn’t until very recently maybe 2 months ago that I began thinking maybe I have a mental health disorder. And the more I thought about it and the more I examined my behavior the more likely it seemed. Only problem is I’m black and in the African American community mental health isn’t took seriously at all. So I’ve been trynna figure out ways to tell my parents if they could maybe help me see a professional. Some help would be welcomed.,01Jan2020,1
163,"So being new year's I got so fucked up I blacked out for part of the night and today I've felt the most depressed since before I started medication.

The problem is that I like drinking too much even though it worsens my depression. People find me hilarious and the life of the party when I get drunk but secretly I just do it to feel different and help me tolerate social interaction. What they don't see is me drinking alone every time there's alcohol in my apartment.

I don't know if I have the resolve to quit but I'm considering trying it. I know I won't lose the part of me that people like, but it's a difficult act to maintain in larger social gatherings. I isolate because I need time alone to be myself but it also leads to more temptation to indulge my vices and alienate myself.",01Jan2020,1

I keep reading about aspd but surely I am not a sociopath. Do sociopaths spend years wondering why they don't understand other people? Maybe. I'm not sure. Maybe someone diagnosed could answer a question or two. I don't want to see another therapist, I'll lie to them again to hide myself I know it. Why do people feel empathy? Why guilt, remorse? Why don't I?",01Jan2020,1

Hi, I am a male(25) who has been going to the psychologists after having full blown anxiety a year ago. The psychologists wrote that I might have an anxious preoccupied attachtment style(onveilig (ambivalent) gehecht in Dutch). 

A short flashback to a year ago:

I used to live at my cousin’s house. My sleep was horrible, because I did not feel at home there. That’s also when I started taking meds to treat anxiety. Now I live at my grandparent’s and here I feel more rested. However, I always isolate myself in my room. And I also can not go back to my mother’s house, because she lives abroad now. 

I just had a conversation with her about my struggle to find a job (while I’m also studying) so that I can find a place for myself. It feels as if I’m stuck here due to my anxiety and that most of the interaction’s with others is negatively influenced because of Anxiety.

Are there people who have experienced the same struggle as mentioned above. 

How did you overcome such struggles?",01Jan2020,1
166,I know I need professional help but what I'm scared about is getting put into a mental hospital and eventually the government will hear about me and what goes on in my head and will take me back and I don't know experiment on me and I won't be able to ever go back to the real world and I'll lose everyone I care about. I don't know what to do because I keep getting worse and worse which also makes the fear worse and worse,01Jan2020,1
167,"My ex has been an abusive narcissist. He verbally and emotionally abused me on a daily basis, gaslighted me, blamed me for literally everything (like the high school I used to go to or him not getting a job), lied to me, constantly fought with me. I resorted to self harm, had 2 ""serious"" suicide attempts, many more where not much happened, cried literally every day. Now I ditched him for good, and up till now I thought I was indifferent to him. 
Truth is, I hate him beyond understanding. I resent everything he's ever done. I'm so hurt that I feel like I'll never heal again. I told him everything the worst, worded it so horribly, intended to hurt him so he can feel at least 1% of what I did.
My mind has gone destructive in a different manner. I observed that I enjoy hurting men. I feel good seducing them and making them fall for me, feeding them with false hope, often risking a whole lot when they mingle with me. I seek out the vengeance everywhere. 
I recently met a kind guy in therapy and we fell in love. He's really sweet, sensitive, understanding, has also had a share of shitty exes. I'm horribly scared I'll want to hurt him too. 
What do I do with this mess? I feel guilty even thinking about it. It's madness. It's taking over me.",01Jan2020,1
168,"Hello! First time poster, first time lurker. Excuse any faux pas I may inadvertently create.

To start, I (F24) see both a psychiatrist and a therapist already. I am on Lithium and Abilify which seem to work with varying degrees of success. I sometimes struggle with taking the Lithium consistently as the pills are rather large and I am a baby when it comes to swallowing pills. I am diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder.

Things started getting bad around 2017. I was home alone in my room when I heard someone come up the stairs and walk around the loft. I thought it was my roommate. I checked my window and saw only my car in the drive way. I was immediately frightened and thought someone had broken into the house, but couldn’t make sense of that because since the footsteps I had heard nothing else. But with some inexplicable certainty I knew I was not alone.

Throughout this I texted my boyfriend, too scared to call and make noise. I must have stayed in my room for at least an hour before I gained the courage to leave my room. My bf had suggested perhaps a shower would calm me down.

During the shower a face haunted me in the background. I’d look over my shoulder and it would just be there, sallow skin and an abyss for eyes.

That was the first time—definitively—that I hallucinated.

I think from just the bizarreness of the situation, my bf at the time did not quite take the situation seriously. I wouldn’t say he didn’t believe me, but more thought my fear was getting the better of me. I spent the rest of the night locked in my room.
Soon after, with my bf of the time spending the night with me, I went downstairs to get the laundry out of the dryer and to get a bowl of ice cream. While getting the laundry I heard the dog tags chime from my small Chihuahua, Dandy, coming down the stairs to follow me. I turned around to greet him but he wasn’t there. I was confused, but not scared.

As I walked toward the kitchen I caught the reflection of Dandy in the sliding glass door. I looked from the reflection to where he would be standing only to find nothing there. Again, I passed it off as nothing.
It wasn’t until I was getting the ice cream that I knew something was wrong. As I grabbed the bowls I saw a woman in my dining room, just standing there staring at me. I froze. I couldn’t speak. I couldn’t move. I knew what I was seeing wasn’t real, I knew it wasn’t, but all the same I felt like a child left alone in the dark: paralyzed.

Eventually I was able to budge and I ran up the stairs crying to my bf. I think that’s when we both decided that it wasn’t just me being scared, something was wrong. I had already been seeing a psychiatrist for mood swings—diagnosed as Cyclothymia—for a month or so. When I went back to my doctor and explained what had happened, he diagnosed me as Bipolar instead. I did not particularly agree with this doctor, got a second opinion, went through some kind of testing, and was finally diagnosed with Schizoaffective.

Around the time of the hallucinations, it started to become apparent that I had other issues as well. Paranoia for one. If I don’t keep up with my medication I get this idea in my head that my pills are not my pills, and that if I take them I could get hurt. Currently, however, the most pressing issue that has me the most concerned has to do with my memory.

I have gone to a neurologist (I think that’s what he was). I have done verbal tests and gotten a CT scan done. Though with the verbal tests he said I scored below average, for the CT scan he said I was clear.
My concern, however, is that I can lose hours at a time. The latest incident involved my bf and I fighting that ended with us breaking up. It started in the morning and lasted into the afternoon. I remember that we started talking calmly about some issues we had been having, and then the next thing I know I am bawling my eyes out, he’s leaving—pissed—and I am begging him to stay. I have no idea what we talked about. I have no idea how things escalated to the point that they did. It’s just a blank space—nothing. I have no clue of what I said at all.

I suppose my main reason for posting here is to know if other people, specifically those that suffer from mood disorders, experience the same lapse in time. My doctor’s say there’s nothing wrong, but I feel like that just can’t be right. I will be seeing my psychiatrist and therapist soon, and plan to bring it up again, but I thought coming to Reddit might shed some light on the situation—or at least get me peace of mind or advice from those in the same situation or similar.",01Jan2020,1
169,"This is a post I've been meaning to write for a while. Being New Year it seems even more relevant, eg: - People are setting their New Year's Resolutions - People are posting on social media saying what they've achieved over the past decade and what they hope to achieve over this next decade. Anyway,... a little about me: I'm a 25 year old guy. I'm not the sort of person to sit at home playing computer games or anything like that. I'm active (love the gym), enjoy socialising with friends at bars or night outs etc etc. However there's very little else I want out of life right now.

I'm in a job that I don't find fulfilling or challenging and it's pretty montonenous but it's an easy pace of life... I wake up at 8am in the week (a nice lie-in compared to most jobs), then do very little in my office job, find it easy and stress-free despite it being boring. All of this I don't mind though as I don't like stress. I then go to the gym for 2 hours after work and lift weights. I then go home and sleep for day 2. When the weekend comes I usually do the same sort of thing... see friends, go for dinner, get very drunk somewhere and usually spend Sunday hungover and sleeping. I have friends that have goals like becoming a millionaire or having £1m in assets (property) or generally very career driven but I don't want the long days and stress that comes with this.

I'm happy with a simple life without the stress and increases leisure/home time to do things I enjoy. I wake up and it's light outside and get home before it's dark. I do feel guilty sometimes because naturally I can push myself very hard (eg at the gym I work very hard) and sometimes I do feel guilty that I should want or expect more out of life.

I don't know if it's laziness being how I am. I've seen posts like this before on Reddit but the difference is, usually the person who writes it says things like ""I don't know what I want out of life - I don't have a job, play computer games and watch porn through the day, don't leave my messy bedroom and don't socialise with friends apart from gamer friends"". That's not my personality at all however I guess the similar theme is I don't want much other than stress-limitation.

I guess the only goal I have for this year is to find a girlfriend. However even then I'm not going to actively force this. If it happens it happens but I'm not going to chase anything especially if it leads to stress. Also if I feel the relationship is going to lead to stress then I quickly cut it off.

Is it weird to want so little from life and be happy with a minimalistic, simple life?",01Jan2020,1

She agreed, and said that her, and her bf said that they wont do that. But she also said they shell give the puppy a light slap sometimes. Last night she brought her puppy over, and the dog likes to nip sometimes. And ask I was walking to another room I heard a faint slap sound.

178,"Hello. I'm in bed and I just had an idea and I want to share it with you guys. 

I've been struggling with depression for the better part of my life. I've been through times where I couldn't walk or speak properly because of it. I've been on the verge of suicide. I've been to 5 different therapists and took many doses of antidepressants, none of it worked. I couldn't bring myself to shower or change or brush my teeth. It's been pretty bad, I could go on.

Recently I've gotten so much better, and I'm grateful. So I want to share with you this idea that I just had, and I hope it makes you guys see things in a different light. It's my interpretation of mental health. 

Now, I've come from a family of overweight people. We weren't exactly born with the best shape or the best confidence in the world. And up until years ago, around when I was in 10th grade, I couldn't even bring myself to exercise or do anything about it. Until one day, I decided I want to be better than my family. I prepared myself and I registered at the local gym, and that day I exercised like hell. And I did the same for the rest of the week and it was exhausting. I'd never worked out before. But when I looked at myself in the mirror a week after, I saw virtually no progress whatsoever. It was annoying, but I knew I couldn't expect any results after a week!

I think the same thing went for my mental health. I've tried so many things. SO many things. And none of them seemed to make a difference. I would gather all my energy to try to get a healthier lifestyle, and I would still feel like I just wanted to die. I've tried all kinds of coping. The healthy ones and the bad ones. Nothing seemed to cut it. I've tried giving myself positive feedback. Starting with small steps. Smoking. Drinking. Quitting. Going to therapy. Going to parties. Meeting new people. Hanging out with my friends. Medication. Meditation. Prayers. Reaching out. Keeping myself busy. Getting a hobby. Doing charity work. Taking a break. Treating myself even when I felt like I didn't deserve it. Listening to music. Crying. Not crying. Faking it. Not faking it. Talking about it. Not talking about it. Reading books about depression. ""Steering into the skid."" Working in uni. Taking a minor in something I love. Dropping it. The list goes on.

Throughout all these years, everytime I had a little energy I put it into making myself better, and it broke my heart every time. But now, I'm starting to notice the growth in myself and the every day choices I make. I still deal with pain, sure, but no one's ever happy all the time, are they? 

When you're trying to lose weight, you might start to notice some differences in yourself. But then you relapse. And you go back. Maybe even worse than when you started. Then you try again. And again. And again.

179,"Hi, I don't quite know how to use this app, but I am desperate and a little scared. Last night was a scary night for me and I suppose to fully explain everything you'll need a backstory. For the sake of keeping it as simple and private as possible, I'll try to keep it short:

when I was younger, about 5, there were a series of traumatic events in my life. my step father was abusive to my mother, lots of fighting, my mom was sick with cancer, etc. I was a child at the time, but it did feel like I had to take on the role of an adult. Taking care of a sick mom and a little brother was a lot of work. As years went on, thinks would get better and worse as they do for anyone, but I would always feel the lows intensely. My first feelings of bad anxiety probably started around 8th grade so I was around 13. I would say that I was depressed at the time and I now know that I have anxiety and depression. My mom's relationship with me became toxic and complicated. For instance we would scream and fight and she would say that she wanted me to die, but the next hour she would say it's because she loves me and she was sorry. All was forgiven, but over time my guard was raised. I became fearful of her. It was like walking on eggshells and while I was the one being screamed at, it was me who had to comfort her. This continued for years, but my mom and I are finally in a pretty good place.  

 okay here I go...

Last night my mother and her boyfriend got into an argument. There is no abuse anymore. There is no bad man to hurt my mom. But as soon as it started, I remembered exactly how I felt being young and afraid. Panic took over even when there was a part of me saying things were okay. As the argument went on I was able to calm myself down a little, but not enough. My mom eventually went to go downstairs and she fell. Completely accidental. Nobody pushed her. She just slipped. I went to check on her and saw her at the bottom of the stairs crying and saying she hurt her elbow. 

What happens next is a bit hard for me to put into words, but my whole body went into this frenzy of panic. I screamed over and over for someone to ""help her"", but I couldn't think to move to her or calmly ask for help. I just screamed to the top of my lungs. I have had only one or two other experiences like this, but never as bad. I just screamed. My brother and mom's boyfriend came out immediately to help, but words couldn't form. I couldn't explain what was happening. All I could do was scream. I recall falling on the floor. I recall pulling my hair and hitting myself. I recall laying on the ground and kicking. At one point I pushed myself against the wall so hard that I cracked a hole in the drywall. This is embarrassing to write because even as it was happening I was aware that I was irrational. But I couldn't stop. I was hyperventilating and sobbing and I was unstoppable.

 Eventually I was able to get to a point of reason. I took a pill for anxiety. It's called hydroxyzine and it is for when I have anxiety attacks which used to be frequent throughout my first few years of high school. I drank some water and my mom went upstairs. Everyone was okay, but I still felt off. I began to become very confused by my surroundings. I knew it was my home. I knew everything, but it didn't feel right. The same thing happened when I looked at my reflection (something I do when I feel anxious) My face didn't look like me even though I knew it was. I found myself humming without meaning to and I kept saying the word ""okay."" It's hard to explain, but was like I kept saying it without thinking. Like saying is was a part of breathing. It just kept coming out. That was the first sign in my head that something was wrong. I couldn't stop myself from saying it. It was the only thing making me feel better and any other words that tried to come out felt wrong. 

My mom did come out of her room to apologize for the way everything happened. She wanted to make sure I was okay and I thought I was getting there until she hugged me. I was tense. I knew that. I was still a little panicked, but I thought it would all blow over. My mom held me and all I knew is that I didn't want to be me. I began asking her if I could ""just be five again""  I just wanted to be five. I could hear my voice changing and I swear I could feel myself shrinking. Like physically, my body became smaller. I couldn't stop talking like a small little child. The voice was unfamiliar and scary to me because I couldn't stop it and I knew that I was not acting normal. The closest thing I could compare it to is the scenes in posession movies where the ""demon"" is talking and the host is trying to fight it. I couldn't stop myself. My ears were whooshing. My body felt small but incredibly heavy and and this point I could tell my mom saw what was happening too. I wasn't just imagining this. She walked me to my room and I was scared because even more so than before, nothing felt right around me. I knew I was home, but it felt unfamiliar. She laid me in bed and it's almost like I slowly started coming back.

For the next 30 minutes my mom talked to me, telling me my name and my age. It was scary because I knew these things, but they felt wrong. I think the last thing that really helped me was looking in the mirror. Like I said before, looking in the mirror always seems to ground me when I'm anxious. My face felt wrong. My height felt wrong. My body (mostly my curves that come with age) felt wrong. It was almost comical to see that I had breasts. It was like I was seeing myself still as 5 year old me, looking at a picture of myself from the future. Slowly though, I was able to put together all of my pieces. My mom had to keep reminding me we were safe as we looked in the mirror together. She showed me the hair on her head (something that wasn't there as she went through chemo) and I sobbed. She made me repeat some positive phrases to myself as I looked in the mirror as well as making me repeat my name and age. I resurfaced, finally feeling like myself again. I was able to calm myself and get into bed. Though I was okay, I did feel shaken. 

Today, the events that took place last night feel blurry and scary. I am sorry that this post is so long and I am not expecting anyone to be a doctor and help me. I am embarrassed for how I acted. I just want to know if anyone else has had a similar experience or can tell me if they know what it is. I do have a psychiatrist and am working on getting into therapy. I keep trying to google what happened (I know I shouldn't self diagnose) but nothing seems to be coming up. If anyone has any answers or recommendations, I am open ears. Thank you for reading this if you finally made it to the end, and please no judgment. I just want answers and maybe a little help.",01Jan2020,1
180,"I was wondering if anyone had any good coping skills that seem to work for them, thank you in advance.

I’ve (18f) been dealing with depression and generalized for about 6-7 years now. I am also considered suicidal. I have the kind of depression where I can’t get out of bed and I’ve been distancing myself from friends. 2019 has been quite the shit show for me, with a lot of family issues and I haven’t felt genuinely happy in months, I’m running out of options and I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m at my wits end and I am between a rock and a hard place. I can’t be on medication because I have to get other medication in check before starting a new one. 
I feel like my life is in shambles and I have no control.


I’m only alive for other people, it’s not for me. I am alive because of my mom, I can’t leave her, I’m her only child and she adopted me, she is the only parent who wanted Me, my dad told me he never wanted me when I was 7 (he was/still is an abusive alcoholic), and my step dad is no saint either. I can’t leave my boyfriend or my friends either, I can’t bare to hurt them, but I can’t take living anymore.",01Jan2020,1
181,"Trigger warnings: Depression, suicide, self harm, anxiety, bullying, eating disorders

First of all, I was only 5 at the beginning of the decade so I will be skipping forward a couple years. I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and gender dysphoria. A big part of my depression and anxiety comes from genetics but that has caused other issues that derived from the original genetic issue.

My earliest memory of depression was in 3rd grade (8/9 years old) when I was living in (arguably) the most beautiful place in the world for a year, Hawaii. I remember asking my parents if I could go to therapy because I was getting too upset too often, and that's about all that happened. I went to a therapist for a few months but then we moved back to my current home/state and nothing ever came after that for a few years. 

My symptoms of depression and anxiety skyrocketed to become very severe when I got into 8th grade (11/12 years old I think). I also began going through puberty which anyone with gender dysphoria knows is one hell of a time. I was having a lot of social issues and began self harming a lot. A past classmate and friend who I confided in about my depression told my parents who found all my self harm marks and put me into therapy. 

I hate therapy and even the idea is therapy. The first therapist I saw did not help me at all. Part of that was my fault because I withheld so much information from her but another part was she just wasn't the right fit for me. I tried to put out my signals of distress many times to my friends but nothing came of those. Looking back I know it was unfair for me to expect a group of 12 year olds to help and deal with my severe depression especially when a lot of them were involved with the social issues I was having. 

Over the course of middle school (6th-8th grade) I also developed an eating disorder. This were never diagnosed by a professional because I never told anyone but I'd assume that forcing myself to throw up the lunch I just ate would classify me as bulimic. 

Middle school ages are hard enough as it is but at that time it felt like I was dealing with 1 million added problems from my peers. I was honestly counting down the days until my mental illnesses took my life. I was only 12 years old. To add to all of this I was realizing I was bisexual and had a lot of internalized anxiety and self hatred for that. 

Fast forward to 8th grade (13/14 years old) my parents had finally decided to transfer me to a different school since i was having so many issues. My 8th grade year was NOT perfect but it was at the time a massive improvement. 

In 8th grade i became best friends with someone extremely manipulative. I hadn't noticed his manipulative nature, though, and was very dedicated and loyal to our friendship. This friendship caused me a lot of issues towards the end of 8th grade and in the beginning of highschool. 

Overall in middle school I believe I was hospitalized 3 times. Once in 7th grade and twice in 8th grade. 2 times were by my parents and once was from a ""medical professional"" who wrongfully called the hospital and forced me into hospitalization (I got out as soon as I talked to a doctor because that woman was in the wrong). 

In 9th grade (14/15) I ended up going to the same high school as my now ex-friend, the manipulator. I still had a little hope we could repair our friendship but that hope quickly when he started spreading rumors about me and my mental health. At this point I was still 100% I the closet about my sexuality and gender, had stopped self harming, and I believe had recovered from my eating disorders.

I had gotten into a long distance online relationship and while that relationship was not awful when it ended it took a hard toll on me. At that point I had had so many people I cared for leave me for seemingly no reason which has and still does cause me a lot of clingy issues to this day. 

In late 9th grade I came out as bisexual and a transgender man. Shortly after that the therapist I had been talking to for 2+ years (who I loved and helped me a lot) said that she didn't think she was supporting me in a way I needed and advised i find a different therapist. That, understandably, messed me up. Like I said, I had an issue with people suddenly leaving which she knew and I felt very wronged by her decision. I did find a therapist, though, and still talk to him to this day. He is great. 

At this point I had been on a bunch of medications. I started taking medication after my first hospitalization and have been on so many different kinds, doses, and mixtures that my mom keeps a list of everything I've tried. Medication has never helped me, I either get negative side effect or it had no effect at all. 

Now, in 10th grade (15/16). There have been a lot of ups and downs since me coming out and finding a new therapist but this post is already so long. My mental health has never improved as much as it did in late 2019.  Things still hurt me but it's been a long time since I last self harmed. People still leave me and that will always still hurt. The most recent person to leave (late November of 2019) had brought a lot of pain onto me. I had returned to one of the darkest places I had been in a very long time. I was very close to relapsing or killing myself. I cried harder than I had in months. But a few days later I had basically recovered completely. It has been the quickest recovery I have ever experienced. 

Just because my biggest improvements happened recently doesn't mean I was happy 24/7, trust me. The thing that changed for me is that I finally feel like I'm gaining control over myself and my emotions. 

""I feel better.""

""I feel better"" are words I never thought I'd be able to say honestly just a few years ago but it's true. I feel better. 

I will never be 100% perfectly ok and thats ok. I lost track of all the times I hurt myself, of all the times I threw up, the times I cried, and the times i tried to take my life. In middle school I thought I'd never live to be 20 years old. I know what it's like to be literal seconds away from killing myself. I've been there, I've taken the pills, I've tied the belt around my neck, I've held the blades, and I'm telling YOU that it's not the right answer. I am telling you, the person reading this, that it will get better. 

I'm 2 weeks away from turning 16 years old. I am no where near done with my mental health journey. Life sucks, it does and there's no denying that. 

But it gets better.",01Jan2020,1
182,"I used to be severely depressed and I attempted suicide 2-3 times (not quite sure as I have a few periods of my life that are really hazy, because, well, depression fucks up your memory), in the span of a few years. My family never found out because each time I woke up, having failed, before anyone found me. 

I am eternally grateful I failed, and that my parents won't ever have to bear that burden.

Because I am much better now. After years of therapy and really prioritising my mental health, I can finally say I know what happiness feels like. 

And I can say without lying that I don't want to die, that I want to live. Because I truly want more time with the people I love, to grow and experience life, its ups and downs, and what it's like to be happy for more than a day. 

Sure I still have depressive episodes, but they last a shorter and shorter amount of time, and they come much less often. I now know they're temporary, so, for me, it's easier to push through.

Yet the thought of death still seems so nice and peaceful, and not scary at all. The phrase 'the sweet embrace of death', still rings true to me, so much so, that I still think about jumping off a roof into the quiet realm of nothingness. It feels like it's easier to just be dead than to have to deal with emotions - good or bad, that are just too overwhelming and intense at times to bear. I still yearn to just let go, to just stop... living...

Despite actually loving what my life is right now, and despite being true to myself for the first time ever??

I guess I just don't get why it's still so tempting despite me really enjoying life for once. It's like I have to hold myself back all the time, and I just thought that would end once I got better, but it just hasn't...

Anyone else feel like this, or am I just doomed to walk around wanting to off myself every chance I get, without really wanting to?",01Jan2020,1
