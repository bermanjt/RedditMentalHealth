0,I made this post earlier and it just came to me. I brought up to my mom something about the virus and she became visibly disturbed and immediately I was like damn. Poor thing. Then I made the post and just wrote that and thought hell yea that's perfect. Because that is exactly what they are. There really is no such thing as normal.,12May2020,1
1,"I'm 32 years old, never had a job, never had a driver's license or driven a vehicle. I have crippling depression and anxiety, so much so that I'm afraid to go outside and talk to people. Not just strangers, but friends(when I had them), and family.

I've been completely dependent on my mother throughout most of these years. Now she's sick and about to go into a nursing home and I don't know what to do. I've dug such a deep hole for myself that I don't know where to start. I think I will become homeless or dead if something doesn't change.

I used to see a therapist, but she won't see me now because I didn't have any insurance and I owe her money that I can't pay because I don't have any income. And now I can't see her even if I wanted to because she's 30 miles away and I can't drive. The town I live in is tiny, only about 200 people, so there's no jobs or places to reach out to. No homeless shelters, no group homes, nothing. I'm scared. I have no life skills, no one to turn to, and I'm just afraid.

I need to know what options there are for me. Or if I'm destined to become homeless or dead.",12May2020,1
2,"New to Reddit but I needed a place to vent/look for some advice. 

I'm just another teen in quarantine, like many others. But every time I do something, there's always a parental voice criticizing, no matter what I'm doing. One of my main frustrations during this lockdown is how my parents berate my eating habits and my lack of exercise. Note that I'm not a super skinny but I'm not obese: I'm in the middle, 5'6 160lbs F. Probably not the healthiest I can be, but not the worst either. Everyday is a new personal heaven––the free time to watch anime, be mentally relaxed and somewhat happy compared to my pre-quarantine frantic and unhappy life at a specialized votec high school for medicine, and the flexibility to do what I want when I want it––and hell––the parental comments about my weight, eating habits, and grades. The things I hate the most are when they call me ""pig, fatass, lazy"", which are already combined with my low-self esteem, deteriorating mental health, and lack of a social life, even before quarantine. I'm just tired of this cycle of belittling that creeps the edges the borders of verbal abuse, but nothings new when you're always home, no friends, and been living like this for close to 16 years right?",12May2020,1
3,"Hello everyone

I am not sure if this is the right sub to post in. I have a friend in a hospital diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. Water in lungs and heart. He was taking Depachine Chrono before for his head because he suffered from epilepsy seizures where he saw hallucinations. Now in the hospital he keeps textinf me that there is someone out to kill him. I dont know what to do nor what does it mean. Can this be some hallucinations or what? He has doctors checking on him every couple of hours but he probably doesnt tell them this stuff because he thinks they will kill him? Or maybe he sees me as his saviour? 

What could this mean?",12May2020,3
4,"Hi, I’ve been working on self improvement for a good 3 months now, since I was dumped. For the majority of it I was doing excellently, I started noticing a confidence, self esteem and motivation boost. I used to be a people pleaser, a pushover, although I’m a social person, I’m always scared of approaching people first whether it be for friendship or because I’m attracted to them. I’ve had really bad self confidence issues all my life too, but I was determined to work on these. I also thought because of my long term health condition (cystic fibrosis) even though I take good care of myself and workout 4 times a week, take all my medication etc that I don’t deserve love. I’ve been rejected for having it in the past and it shook my confidence a lot. A couple of weeks ago though I noticed my ex removed me off social media (which I checked like an idiot, it was the first time I checked in over a month too). My relationship was emotionally abusive, but we both made mistakes. I’ve also been through a rough childhood which I was abused for 8 years but covered it up to my mum  and I feel like that has had a major role on my life and my mental health, I was due to start treatment for anxiety but this has been put back. Anyways since I was removed, I’ve tried to power on but I noticed a lack of motivation and started doubting my self worth again. That lasted a couple of days before I got back on it and started working hard on myself again. Today however I’ve just felt like shit. Felt like I’ll never be loved again, felt like I’m pestering everyone I talk to. Seeking outside validation and being disappointed;ted when I don’t get it on social media. I can’t let these bad habits slack but like I said my mental health isn’t brilliant today. I don’t think this lockdown is helping either but any advice would do, thanks.",12May2020,1

I just ended a 10 month relationship with this girl because of many reasons.

First off we got together in July of 2019. She seemed soooooo in love with me. Wanted me to spend every waking moment with her. I’m 25 by the way and she is 19 and I’m sure her age plays a big factor into this. Anyway, she had an ex in jail and when he got out in October she cheated on me by going to see him, continued to lie about it, and kept seeing both of us at the same time. Eventually I walked away, of course things with him didn’t work out, and 2 weeks later she wanted me back. I felt she had a mistake and took her back.

Everything was good until February, but then one night she snuck off with him and I threatened to break up with her. She came clean about everything after I found hard evidence on her phone that she cheated in October, said she had cheated on all her boyfriends, and I thought accepting her for the mistakes she has made and explaining to her why she cheats (low self-esteem, fear of vulnerability) etc. would help her change. And she did begin to change. I saw more empathy, compassion, and remorse from her than I ever did in the last few months. She was loyal for the last few months too because she was literally always with me. However, I got mad because she lied a few nights ago about her and her friend going to buy weed from this dude. I wasn’t even mad that they did it, but that she lied about it. She denied, got mad and broke up with me because I got mad and seemed like I didn’t want to be with her anymore and then I figured out she went to go see him that night. After this, I couldn’t take it anymore. She didn’t really want to break up but the fact she went to go see him was too disrespectful. I love this girl more than anything in the world, but I couldn’t let myself continue to be disrespected. I broke up with her, told her to seek therapy because she has some massive self-esteem issues, and that I’d still always be there to support her. She cried, thanked me for everything and that she was sorry for everything she has done. However, I just tried to check up on her to make sure she is okay and she accused me of not caring about her because if I did I wouldn’t have left her, which I can now see is manipulation to make me feel guilty and take her back. Also, she is projecting her guilt on to me. This is so sad to watch because I realize this seems to be a massive case of low self worth and that’s why she not only needs me, but also needs to keep stringing along the other guy for additional attention. Do you guys believe this is low self worth, and if so why? Supposedly she has tried to commit suicide twice in her life.

Here’s some additional insight. The first relationship she ever got in, she was cheated on. The second relationship, she was cheated on and physically abused. That’s when she started cheating on that boyfriend with the guy who was in jail, who sexually assaulted her the first time they had sex. She said she used to be a good person, but saw no point in it after all the abuse and became selfish. Can abuse really do this to you? Instead of becoming a better example than these people, she became just like them. 

In addition, she took everything as a personal attack it seemed like, which is another reason why I believe she has massive insecurity issues. If I accidentally interrupted her, she’d get mad for hours. If I went upstairs to talk to my parents for a little bit while she was sleeping, she would get mad and think I didn’t want to spend time with her. If I called another girl by a nickname, she would get pissed off. It’s like she internalized everything as a sign that I didn’t respect her or love her. I love this girl with all my heart and it’s sad to see her be so insecure and also continue to not take full responsibility for her actions, which would actually help her grow and be a better person. I will always love her, but I realize I have to love her from a distance. What causes her to be this way and will she ever change?",12May2020,2
6,"So tldr is that about three years ago i started seeing a therapist to deal with my mental health issues and being at boarding school and dealing with sexual assualt. I have been seeing my therapist for three years now sometimes as frequently as once a week, sometimes once every two months, but over time both of my parents realized that they needed therapy for their own individual reasons instead of seeking out a different therapist they went to mine, so now she is seeing all three of us, is this a conflict of interest? Also how do i tell my dad who believes therapy to be a short trm thing you use to deal with stuff and move on that even though i have had three years of therapy not being 'fixed' is normal and that most likely won't ever be 'fixed'?",12May2020,1

8,"Let me just say sorry in advance for grammar and formatting. I am a native English speaker but not a great one. For the past 24 hours I’ve been filled with the most intense dread I have ever felt. I can barely eat and have been brought to tears multiple times and nothing I do can distract my mind from what it’s feeling right now. It started when I was going to bed last night and while laying there and letting my mind wander, I thought about my parents it popped into my head that they’re getting older and that sooner or later they’re going to die. As am I and my Partner and everyone I care about. Then it occurred to me to think of what happens after death ( I know that we can never really know but i have always leaned towards being atheist) I started to think what it meant to die in a world where there’s nowhere to go. What it meant to cease to exist. To have your memories and thoughts disappear. To no longer be able to hold the ones you love or even think of them. It seemed so cruel and now I can’t get the thought out of my head. The terror of non-existents is what I’m really afraid of. I don’t know what to do. Who to talk to. What to say even. It’s the only fear I have and the worst part is that I can’t just shrug it off and force myself to believe something different like I can with normal intrusive thoughts. Any words of advice or wisdom would go along way. 
What you should know about me: 24M, have been medicated for anxiety (Zoloft) before but it just kinda blunted it and didn’t stop intrusive thoughts at all. That’s all I think.

10,"Hello, I am writing here out of complete desperation. I M22 have been dating my GF22 for the last year and a half. She has always had mental health problems as she has had sexual violence as well as PTSD. As we have been dating her mental health has slowly deteriorated. It has now gotten to the point where she is completely and utterly depressed. She believes that no one cares about her and that she has no place in the world. Her family support is not good and she doesn't have any good friends left.

  
I also have a lot of my own problems that interfere with trying to help her. For starters, I have ADHD-PI which makes it hard for me to listen to her sometimes, or remember certain things. Even things such as a promise to go on a walk with her or something like that, I just forget about it. As much as I try I just can't seem to do anything to help her and it makes me feel awful because I only make her mental situation worse. She is now convinced that I hate her, and don't do anything to help her despite the constant effort I give. All she ever says is that I hate her and don't want anything to do with her.  
To be perfectly honest, it has become harder and harder to do things in my own life because of her. I have given up friends and opportunities for her because I have always tried to do what I can to help her. It just doesn't seem to matter, it just keeps getting worse.

 I have gotten to points in the past where I feel like I am such a bad thing in her life that I need to break up with her. I am constantly hearing how detrimental I am for her and how my own problems affect her. I just can't help but feel if she wasn't around me she wouldn't feel like she is a problem in my life and that in the long run, she would be happier. I am at that point again. Every day all she says is how much I hate her and don't want to be around her and that she is just a problem in my life. Like I said earlier, I give her everything I have every day and it just isn't enough. I am also afraid that if I did break up with her it could go the other way and she would hurt herself. I have even gone so far as to look into having her committed to a mental health facility. I really just don't know what to do and I could really use someone's help.",12May2020,1
11,"I’ve never heard another person talk about having this, but it pretty much ruins my mental health. The inconsistency of my life gives me so much anxiety, for pretty much no reason. The past REALLY bothers me. I used to be an entirely different person with a completely different personality as most people are when they are kids but it bothers me that my personality has been inconsistent as I grew up. I think it may be related to OCD, as that runs in my family but I have never been diagnosed. I fear that I will always been seen the same way as I was then.

It’s also the same way for posting on stuff like Instagram. I cannot go a month or so without deleting all of the posts because they’re not perfect or consistent enough. I’m also and artist and it’s the same with my art style, I struggle with all of my art not looking the same all the time.

13,"Hi. I know that there are hundred of questions like this but I am struggling with making a decision for trying SSRI's. I am suffering for depression, generalized and social anxiety for few years now. I am avoiding social contact, the only time I feel euphoric and willing to have fun or talk to friends is when I drink alcohol. I do it occasionally, once or twice per month. I am into sports and gym so I wont drink more often even if I wanted to. I really enjoy having few drinks when meeting with friends, I dont feel worse after drinking, I feel like it resets my mind. Even prior to depression, I was kinda shy, so I still wont have fun without getting a little buzz. This is my biggest concern with hopping into medications. I feel like my anxiety and depression might get worse if I go out with friends who are having fun and I would be just sitting and watching them. Do you think its better to give antidepressants (Lexapro) a try and still have few drinks once or twice a month or dont take SSRI's at all in this case?

16,"Hey I just need to vent a little, I’m sorry if this is the wrong forum or if my problems are too small for all of you amazing people.

I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety finally after several years of struggling and got prescribed antidepressants about a month ago. I have had small sleeping problems before, mostly that it can be hard falling asleep when you’re hyperventilating and having an anxiety attack but that would only bother me maybe once every two weeks. 

Now this last week I haven’t been able to sleep five days in a row. I am not having anxiety attacks, I am just not able to sleep. I am tired all day but when the night comes I just lay awake. I have taken sleeping pills every night but I still can’t sleep. For reference it is now 03:00 where I am and I have lessons in the morning. I am not able to do my schoolwork during the days because I am so tired from not sleeping during the nights. I do not know what to do anymore. I try all hacks I know for falling asleep every night but nothing ever works. 

Is this an effect of my antidepressants? Does anyone have a similar experience? Is there anyone who knows anything I can do to help my situation? I have talked to my doctor about getting prescribed sleep medication (I am currently using medication that I have gotten from friends) but I am scared that will not help since they do not seem to work for me anymore unless I take five times the normal dose.

I am just “tired” (ironic) of this situation.

17,"Hi all. I’m a Master of Social Work student. In all honesty, my mental health has been compromised due to the insane amount of pressure to be PC (use the right language to refer to people, have the same views on everything, do not engage in dialogue, etc). I myself have several conditions which render me classified as neuro atypical (epilepsy, PTSD, ADHD).

In PC culture, it is implied that you are a bigot or just a plain bad person if you use words that are supposedly outdated, which somehow became offensive along the way. For example, to use the term “handicapped parking” is considered obsolete, as is “physically challenged”. They are considered offensive because of this. Also, outdated words can make a comeback years later, so I don’t really see how simply using words that are simply outdated can be bad.

I understand the sentiment behind person-first language, such as saying “person with a disability” rather than “disabled”, but I feel like this can put in too much anxiety-inducing thought into the social justice process to police people’s speech; well-meaning people all want equality for people with disabilities/challenges/impairments, but I find it counterintuitive  to tell people they are using the “wrong words”. I feel this makes people in social justice movements appear to lack grit due to wording issues. I think we should be working towards a common goal rather than nitpicking each other over words.

This is not to say that I think people should say whatever they want. I HATE the “r” word, not because it is outdated, but because it has picked up such negative connotations. It has become indisputably derogatory because of this.

Anyway, I personally don’t think that tailoring speech that is not intended to be offensive really does much harm to people’s mental health. It creates dialogue and allows a space where people don’t have to be so afraid to speak. Sometimes it is even obvious when someone is going out of their way to be politically correct, which can make things worse in my opinion. It implies that disadvantaged people cannot advocate for themselves.",12May2020,1

19,"Hey guys, I'm new here. Looking for a place for support, advice, information, etc. Hopefully this sub can help me out! 

Late Tuesday night/early Wednesday morning, my fiance had some sort of paranoid delusional breakdown. He was escorted to a hospital via ambulance, and from there transported to the psychiatric hospital that's on the same campus. He stayed there until Saturday evening, when he was released. He'd been given Abilify and mostly just monitored. He still had a small amount of paranoia and delusions up through Saturday morning, but hasn't had any since. We picked up his meds Sunday morning and he has a psych appointment scheduled for Wednesday morning.

My fiance seems 90% like himself. He's tired from not getting enough sleep and he's restless (both side effects of Abilify, of course). He remembers everything that happened that night and says it feels very surreal, and he's kinda taken aback at all the thoughts he was having at the time because they're so incredulous (soooo much paranoia). We still aren't 100% certain what triggered the event, but he left the hospital with a Bipolar I diagnosis. I'm not sure how accurate that is, as he doesn't really have a lot of the symptoms other than this episode from that night, but I'm guessing his new psych will help him figure that out. He's been very patient and understanding, has a lot of guilt about what happened, and understands why we're all a bit on edge (""we all"" is me, him, my 18 year old son, and my elderly father). He's doing all the right things. Downloaded a daily mood tracker, taking his meds, being open and honest with his emotions, and validating my concerns/answer my questions at every turn.

I'm trying really hard to just move on and focus on the future, but I'm so scared of another event like that happening again, that I'm almost completely unable to relax in my own home. I'm a little afraid to go to bed at night, even though his episode was non-violent. I can tell my father is also afraid to go to sleep because he's up a LOT at night and then sleeps a lot of the day. My son seems mostly okay, thankfully. I'm just wondering if there's anything I can do to help ease my mind? Is it just going to take time? Are there books I can read that will help? I find myself just kind of staring at him a lot, taking in every single body movement, breath, etc, to see if I can tell whether or not he's okay. I ask him how he's doing often (not like, all the time, but several times a day). He promises me his paranoia and delusions have completely gone at this point, and his mind feels stable, and that he'll let me know if anything changes. So now we're in this endless cycle of worrying about each other (him worrying about me because he knows I'm stressed and scared, me worrying about him because I'm afraid for this to happen again). We're being very open and honest about our thoughts and feelings. If either of us have any kind of concern we voice it and let the other do what they can to alleviate our fears. He's an incredibly kind, thoughtful, and sweet man. Our relationship was amazing before this and I hate that it seems so fractured now. I just want to relax. I want to not be scared.

Generally, I've got a good life &amp; my mental health is strong. A lot of people even rely on me. Yet I seem to always have the urge to ruin or throw away anything good I find in life.

In the past I've thrown away good, healthy relationships without much of a reason outside of an urge to lose it, to get away and be on my own and not do anything for a while. Usually I'll excuse it with another reason, because it's hard to explain this to someone who wants to be with you. It just wouldn't make any sense.   

It's the same when it comes to money, say I get a decent paycheck, most of it will be gone immediately because I feel like I don't want it, money stresses me out.

Any good habits I tend to obtain are gone very quickly as well, I started in the gym &amp; could only keep it going for a few weeks.

Any comment that requires an ounce of thinking just flies over my head, and I'm stuck there with nothing processing in my blank fucking brain. It's hard to explain the feeling, but it's just that-- there is nothing. No feeling at all. I listen to an instructor and immediately forget what they say, I like to think I love my family and my friends but I just don't know, etc etc. I don't even enjoy listening to music anymore. Music! 

I play D&amp;D as a side hobby and many times I simply consider dropping out because of how often I'll drag down a party. Often have the players or the DM make a comment about my forgetfulness-- but it simply just seems like I didn't recall them doing a certain thing in the first place. 

For example, I ask how much stuff our party has: someone will reply that I've already asked that several times. I get embarrassed, go into a quiet spiral of shame and self-loathing, and then promptly laugh it off as a 'haha dumb blonde moment'. And whenever a puzzle popped up-- yep! You guessed it! No matter how long I look over the damn thing, I can never figure it out. I've gotten to the point where I even think my text chatting makes no coherent sense.

You’re weak.”  “There are people going through a lot worse.”  You de-value our situation despite the fact there is a chemical imbalance in our brains causing us to feel this way.  You avoid us, ignore us, and bully us.  

But suicide is the most selfish thing you can do.

When we actually get the feeling we aren’t a burden to you, and we try to tell you how we’re feeling and actually ask you for help?  Help that you won’t give us without us begging for it?  You blow us off by lying about something ‘important’ you have to do.  Only not even an hour later, we see on Snapchat that you’re out with other people having a good time and leaving us to sit and stew in a flurry of voices in our heads telling us we’re not good enough and this story post?  This is just more proof that we’re unwanted.  A burden.

But suicide is the most selfish thing you can do.

We try to go to therapy for it but the therapist is not in the least bit helpful and doesn’t want to actually fix us, so they put us on narcotics that screw with our heads and make us feel numb.  Yeah, we don’t feel sad anymore.  But we don’t feel happy or excited or anything.  We feel literally nothing at all.  And all that just because again, we seem to be a burden and not worth the time to help so we’re stripped of our ability to feel any emotion whatsoever.  And if we decide we just want to feel any emotion at all and go off of these narcotics?  We spiral out of control and into a violent break-down, often resulting in what we were trying to prevent in the first place happening.

But suicide is the most selfish thing you can do.

We try to point out that even though you claim it is the most selfish thing we can do, you don’t seem to be doing anything selfless to help us out.  And at that moment, you turn on us and berate us and call us ungrateful and selfish because “I was only trying to help you as best I could and this is how you repay me?!”  You could have done so much more but instead you put in less than the bare minimum amount of effort with us and now we have absolutely nobody because we decided to trust you enough to keep talking to you while we were disconnecting ourselves from everyone else because we feel like an unwanted burden and everyone would in fact be better off without us.  And in that moment we realize you didn’t truly care.  You just wanted to feel better about yourself.  You simply wanted to be able to claim you’re helping your depressed, suicidal friend so you would seem like a good person when in reality you’re a manipulative piece of shit and we never should have given you the time of day.  And you cut us off, not us.  And left us with nasty, venomous words rattling and echoing in our heads.  Words that push us over the edge, or words that put us so close even dropping a mug of coffee and making a mess will push us over the edge.

But suicide is the most selfish thing you can do.

And after all of that, when we do finally go through with it, and we’ve left this world, you suddenly act all sad and shit because we’re gone.  We were your best friend and so close.  Only you never once decided to help us.  You saw all the warning signs.  The profile for someone going through with suicide isn't hard to look up.  It should be taught in school.  We almost all fit the profile.  You saw the warning signs, we reached out for your help.  But no.  You never once thought about us, only yourself and what would be easiest for you to do.  What would be most enjoyable for you to do.  And you left us without any outlet or help.

But suicide is the most selfish thing you can do.

Maybe we aren't the selfish ones.  We're the ones who actually listened to you.  We're the ones who despite how strong our urge and desire to end it all was, continued on because we thought you cared and we thought you'd be hurt if we were gone.  We set aside what we wanted in our lives and did what you asked of us just for it to blow up in our faces and screw us.  Maybe YOU were the selfish one.  Not us.

29,"(trigger warning for self harm, depression, and anxiety, yaaaaay.)

i lived in a good family. i’ve been told so by my parents for my whole life. i ended up taking a mental health plummet in the fifth grade and ended up dealing with self-injury. i think my mother meant well, but when i went on a school trip to a museum, she made me look at my wounds under a microscope. along with other incidents relating to my self-injury, that one stuck with me. and a bit later, people along with my own parents told me how others had been through worse, later going on a tangent about their own issues. 

i entered a relationship, and got told off later for it and that i didn’t know what love was. then they say something like “you know we’ll always love you, right?” i brought up the incidents from fifth maybe 1-2 weeks after being diagnosed with depression and anxiety, only now feeling a bit more comfortable, but it escalated and things got bad. my mother says stuff when she gets angry, but when it’s bad enough she yelled at me asking if i wanted her to leave and/or kill herself. this was the second time this happened. 

my father later said “i know you’re struggling with this depression and all that, but you have to treat others with respect.” even now, i still experience panic attacks if i somehow get reminded of the event. but i can’t help but wonder if it was my fault. if it was my fault for bringing it up.",12May2020,1

31,"So for the past year, my mental health has regressed a lot. I have been so frustrated because a year ago, things were going really well for me and I didn’t know what happened. Well I was looking through my medical records for insurance purposes and noticed huh.... I started gaining a lot of weight after I switched one of my medications out for the generic brand.... (I’m a stress eater, so this should have been a big clue for me, but I’m dumb). Looked at my mood journal and noticed an uptick in more bad days after I switched and my panic attacks started a couple months after too. Okay..... that’s certainly coincidental.... but this medication isn’t even for my anxiety or depression??? And I was fine when I was taking the brand name so that shouldn’t be the problem??? Looked up side effects for the medication I switched out and saw that depression and worsening mood was a side effect. So I called the doctor just to ask if it was possible that it could be affecting my mood? And she said yes it is! She said that though generic drugs have the same ingredients, that doesn’t mean it’s identical and that my body might not be reacting in the same way as it would with the brand name. So she had me switch back to the brand name and it’s been a few weeks and I’m doing much better. It costs a bit more, but in the long run, it’s a small price to pay for my mental well being. So I just thought I’d make a PSA and remind y’all to always monitor your moods and mental health after you start a new drug (even if it’s not for your mental illness) so you don’t make my dumb mistake.",12May2020,1

35,"So, where to start. I cant believe im on here typing this, ive contemplated this for awhile. Ill try to be as short and sweet as possible, but this'll be a little long, if you have the time please read through.

So I met this guy in university, I was with someone at the time (Andrew) and we actually were a friend group of 4. So it was me, Andrew, Rebecca, and lets call him Bob. It wasn't long before me and this guy, Bob, got together. Me and Andrew had a toxic relationship that ended badly, that tied in with a toxic relationship with my mom as well, Rebecca tried to understand me. Rebecca however, wasn't a good friend to me because of a few reasons. Rebecca ended up having a thing for Bob but he didnt feel the same way, Rebecca and Bob ended on the same night me and Andrew did. Fastforward awhile later, it was Rebecca and Andrew hanging out, while me and Bob hung out. So the fantastic four was over. Me and Bob fell for each other, I can say I did way more than he. So when we started dating it was too soon after my first break up, so my mom was worried but she didnt act out in the best ways I guess. So after a month of dating my mom forced us to let him meet our family. That was not the best since she said things that were pretty embarrassing like ""oh you only make that much?"" talking about the fathers income, and I guess a few other things but you get the point. So it didnt end the best, but I was the one to end it, so after 3 months of dating we were on break for 2 months where we didnt communicate to each other at all. Then we did start talking again and eventually got back together, of course, me being young and immature, I was way more into him than he was. But I also made him a huge part of my life, I was definitely a lot more committed, he would prioritize almost everything before me, and he would ""flirt"" (not actually flirt but give girls the impression he liked them because he was friendly, to the point where girls will come to me and ask me if they can go for him), and so we went on breaks multiple times because we had fights to do with all of that. During our breaks he would seek out other women, not actively, but passively. Ill see him ask friends if this girl is single, or show interest in a girl while we weren't talking, but we always ended up back together. So eventually he graduates and is leaving the country, I was crying because of how proud I was for him, and I knew that I would never say anything to show him I wanted him to stay because I wanted him to follow what he wants. He says that he cant do long distance so we have to break up, obviously im left in shabbles again, and again. So we break up while he's gone but we kept in contact and after a month or so he says he wants to try things again. I say I dont think thats a good idea, trying to step up for myself, I guess to give context I've lived a life of physical and emotional abuse and I was really really trying to get myself out of unhealthy habits I have kept succumbing to. But I said when he comes to visit if I feel loved and secure than maybe we can try things out again, but I cant just keep going in and out of this relationship. At the time when he said he wanted to try things again, he was depressed, I told him that he only feels like he needs me now because he has nothing else, but when I had everything I always wanted him to be part of it. Either way, I tried to communicate to him whenever he needed me while trying to move on, I started going on dates for the first time etc, and man I didnt know people who like you could treat you as well as some of the dates I went on. So I respond less and less to him, he's aware that im also trying to move on, he mentioned he is as well, eventually he asks me for no more contact and I told him I respect his wishes. So a few weeks go by and I guess im seeing someone, and Bob was as well. However, a situation happened with my mom which got Bob to talk to me and ask how everything was, and we talked and said we wanted to try things out again. He mentioned to me hes moving back and that we should start over again. He comes back and things were good but also not good. I could tell now hes a lot more into me than I am into him, I did feel resentment and hurt towards him for a lot of the things he said and did. Anyway things were shaky. He still kept making girls feel more important than I was - saying this based off of what Ive seen then asked others what they thought and agreed with me, more girls asking me if they could go for him, an example would be when a female friend was upset he would notice and comfort her, go above and beyond, but not the same for me, so I told him again lets just be friends since this isnt working out, which I felt like we actually ended well, no passive aggression or anything. But then he started acting childish as we have a large mutual friend group, if we were in public he would invite them all over to do something and leave me out - multiple times, so I would sit on a table alone until they were back, or not get a car ride somewhere that he planned. So once when he offered a ride for everyone home except me (to also include everyone there was not his friend but a bunch of the girls who thought he liked them, I also did not have a car, we were there to celebrate a dinner for my friends grad), a mutual friend of ours, lets call him Bert, said he can take me home. Bert would always make sure I was okay, he always noticed when I was crying, and always tried to comfort me. It felt like Bert was my only friend, I told him he is like a little brother to me. Eventually Bert kisses me out of the blue while I was crying, and tells me he likes me, I didnt know how to react so I said I think I might like him too, which was a dumb move from my end. That same day after Bob drove everyone home he called me but my phone was off so I saw it at 11 pm, he tells me he wants us to meet up and talk, that he misses me. I was angry, and I told him he always makes it a thing for me to feel left out (bob knows my history of neglect, not having a sense of belonging, and abuse, so it felt as though he was using the only thing ive ever told him against me), but I met up with him and he wanted to get back together. I told him its over for good and he kept apologizing and explaining all the things he had to change (which surprised me because I didnt know he knew those things hurt me the way they did), he said that a friend of his mentioned that he talks to girls in a way that makes them think he likes them (something ive been saying for years) and he finally sees there point of view - this also came from a girl who liked him. Anyway, I tell him Bert kissed me and I could see the pain. We didnt talk for another 2 weeks, and I regretted telling him about it but I felt as though its my way out of this mess.I told Bob it was his fault it happened since Bert actually made me feel cared for when he didnt, and was there for me when he wasn't, and told him that I feel like I was taken advantage of and that I cant think of myself outside of that now. I ended up emailing him a long apology obviously. I now wish I didnt cause someone I loved so much that much pain. But I am glad it ended, anyway our mutual friend group and I hung out but Bob didnt come, he eventually calls me yelling about how I broke him and everything, I told him im sorry and that if he wants me to stop hanging out around them I will, because I know if he kissed one of my friends I probably wouldn't be able to forgive him, and would also be very broken. We met up the next day, I knew he didnt have his car so I thought I could pick him up and drop him off, we had a good talk but then my friend messages me saying Bert wants to talk to me, and Bob sees it and leaves my car, thats the last we have ever talked, I tried contacting him from multiple numbers that day, very crazy. I eventually leave the group from my own will, saying I am leaving to focus on school and the group is a distraction. I then saw Bob at events and tried to talk to him, I even saw him hanging out with Bert, they became good friends and I noticed Bert blocked me, Bert eventually blocks Bob and tells me that Bob said the only way they could mend their friendship is to block me, so Bert is back in my life and out of Bobs. When I would see Bob in public I would approach him he would yell at me to leave him alone or he will leave the event and then he would walk away with my mutual friends. So you can say I embarrassed myself very much. I ended up realizing I also had to detach from all my friends, which was very hard for me as I found my family in them, and didnt have many people I was close to (Bob also knows some of my health struggles I was facing, and that ive grown in very lonely environments that still trigger me somewhat, some PTSD over a few things, so I guess what hurt more was just that he knew these are things that I battled everyday with). I eventually blocked Bert out of my life, but he would still deliver food to my house and send me emails etc randomly because of how much of a good person he is, but I cut him out for his own good, since I know I dont like him. Anyway, its taken me a long time to heal as much as I have but I still see them all together posting and hanging out, I cant say it doesn't affect me at all, it does make me a little sad, I wish he didnt hate me and I wish my friends cared a little more about me. I was always known as the class clown, the ""glue"", and all that, words from them of course, I guess it was just handling 17 heart breaks at once, we were also set to get engaged, we almost reach our 3 years together. I felt so disgusted with myself because of what I did. Ive sent bob an email months ago apologizing one last time for everything, with no response. I also confided in three mutual friends about this (the ones I detached from who know him) but it seems as though I was judged for kissing Bert, which I totally agree as well is wrong, but I wonder if the news will go around. One of them mentioned they'll ask how Bob feels if I join back since the girls miss him but never got back to me, been months. Anxiety. I dont want to be back in the group now though. I feel like I have finally come to forgive myself, I know he is now talking to a girl who he once mentioned to me in an argument once as being attractive, im honestly just happy hes been able to move on from this, and I feel like me losing my friends was a consequence of dumb action, but also I have found that they were never real friends to me. I know he thinks of me as crazy, and someone who he loved deeply for the first time hurt him, betrayed, and he never wants to see me near him or anyone he knows. I still feel very guilty. I guess I just wanted your guys' opinions, like ill take any and all opinions. Be ruthless. Its been almost a year now.

I was also head over heels for him, I still love him very much but not in the romantic sense, just an unconditional kind. I do also hope I get to feel or find that again? Ive been on multiple dates with people the past while and have had people who really care for me, but I just dont seem to reciprocate the same thing. I guess its a little worry of mine of will I ever feel that again, or meet someone who I actually vibed so well with (He also mentioned me and him couldn't be friends because we are so compatible)?

in case I was confusing: So Bret is one of Bob's friends, and he kissed me, so technically Bob's friend kissed his ex gf that he was trying to get back together with and get engaged to. So even though Bob did a lot of hurtful things to me none of them were tangible - unlike mine, where I kissed his friend only weeks after breaking up. However, I find Bob's mistakes way more forgivable than my own. After time passed, I ended up wanting to get back together with Bob after but obviously that didnt work, hence embarrassing myself and losing a lot of close friendsAlso I mention the beginning of this story with the ""fantastic four"" because Bob kissed me after I left Andrew, and at one point Bob asked if he should be mad at Bert when in a sense it was the same scenario - so I guess it makes me out to be the problem

40,"Hi there,

This is something that's been eating at me for years. Part of me knows mental health is important and we all go through periods in our lives where we need a little extra help to push through the day and keep a healthy mindset.

The problem is, no matter what type of treatment I'm doing.. I always feel like I don't really fit in.

I've joined countless groups associated with conditions I've been diagnosed with in the past (Anxiety, BiPolar, Schizoaffective, ADHD) and every one of those groups have their fair share of users who give off the impression that said diagnosis belongs to their behaviors in life and yet.

I'm here... Joining the groups... Talking to therapists and getting the help I ocassionally need but I'm told the same thing ""Oh, you're high functioning."" 

Within reason, yes, I am a bit higher functioning than most (I suppose) but it doesn't make me feel like I can relate a lot with people because of this; I feel like a fish out of water. Sometimes I feel like a hypocrite and stop seeking help because of this reason.

I dunno... Guess I needed to vent what's been bothering me and who knows, maybe I'll feel better about my mental health the more I invest on getting better I suppose.

Thanks.",12May2020,2
41,"I suppose I’m just looking for a place to vent. Since February I haven’t been receiving any mental health support, apart from appointments with my general practitioner. In February I had to stop seeing my psychologist, I had seen her weekly for a few years. The psychiatrist who I was newly under didn’t seem to like me and always made me feel like I wasn’t trying and that I wasn’t worthy of their services, so he told me I would no longer be able to attend appointments with them. This felt bad enough considering that I had just revealed to him that I just recently tried to take my own life, but I feel like I’ve not only been thrown out into the world without the skills to cope, but I’ve been thrown into a pandemic. My GP is encouraging me to look into seeing a new psych as my mental health has been declining, but I’m at the point where I don’t want to start again.

46,"Hello,

I suffered an injury awhile back. I was heading to work and crossing the road at a stop sign when a car who was waiting to turn decided to move up and bumped me just below the lateral side (left side) of my knee ( about 2 inches below my knee) while my weight was on my leg. I quickly threw my torso onto his hood otherwise my knee would have snapped in half. I got off his hood, thought I was okay and kept going (big mistake :() I didn’t bother getting his info as I felt he hardly hit me and there was no pain and no swelling either. I was also late for work. My knee started to hurt the next day. 

1 and a half years later I am still suffering. My knee clicks when bending, I feel it catching but doesn’t lock, and my quad shrunk 4” in circumference compared to my other leg.  I had an MRI using a 1.5 Tesla machine which confirmed mild myxoid degeneration in my medical meniscus and mild Chondromalacia behind my patella. I have not been able to run or play any sports ever since. There has never been any swelling.

I think the hardest part for me was letting the driver go. I beat myself up for it everyday and it makes me very depressed. I could have at least sued his insurance company and got a big settlement out of it. Now I’m stuck with a knee problem,depression and nothing. I felt so embarrassed at the time and shocked and just wanted to keep going. Every time I bring the story up to someone they respond by saying “you would have been set at least “ ... this is hard to hear. I think if my knee would have healed I would have got over it.

48,"Hi this’ll be kind of long but please read and respond with any advice/insight. 
I had my first anxiety attack in January. I got home around 3am that night and I felt like my heart was going to fall out of my chest. Of course immediately I thought it was a heart attack. I felt fine the next day and was back to normal the day after that. In March I started to feel very anxious, and unlike myself. I ended up going to the doctor and she prescribed hydroxyzine since it happened more towards the evening/night and I couldn’t sleep due to the anxiety. I did not take it much as it made me feel groggy. I dealt with the anxiety for about a month until it turned into what I believe is depression, as I was crying everyday most of the day, had a decreased appetite, didn’t want to communicate with anyone or get out of bed, and in increase in panic attacks. I do believe my anxiety/depression was stress induced as I worked 2 full time jobs and went to school full time as well as trying to balance a social life. I finally went and got put on Zoloft. I started with 25mg the first week and then increased to 50mg per my PCP. I’m currently on week 4 of 50mg (5 weeks of Zoloft total). I do feel better as I’m not crying every day and I’m not having panic attacks often. But I do still have a bit of trouble sleeping at night as I feel like my heart is going crazy. I had a EKG done when I was first prescribed the hydroxyzine and everything came back normal with my heart. But why do I still feel my heart acting weird? What is causing it? My pulse is usually in the 80’s-90’s when I check it so it’s not racing, but I feel my heart fluttering and I feel my heart beat is strong. It feels like my heart is skipping a beat. It happens more when I’m laying it bed trying to go to sleep. I also feel on edge. I get scared when I think about hanging out with others (when social distancing is over). I just feel this fear come over me. I feel like my General state is just waiting for an anxiety attack to happen. I feel so on edge all the time. Is this normal? Does Zoloft help eventually? Do I need to up my dosage? Or give it time? Any advice would help! Thank you so much!!  

tl;dr: on week 4 of 50mg of zoloft (week 5 total) and I still feel my heart fluttering and my heart beating lousy (like it’s skipping a beat). Does it go away? Do I need to up my dosage or give it time? It feels stronger when I’m laying down not doing anything and trying to go to sleep.",12May2020,1
49,"I am male and met my female best friend about 7 years ago. Just some months before I met her she became lesbian and told me that. I didn't want to date women at that time anyway, but somehow she was the woman I searched all my life for, so after some time I tried everything to at least give me a chance, was open all about my feelings and all.

Anyway it was a hard time and after about 1 year I gave up and we became better and better Friends over time and I was happy to have her and okay with her beeing a lesbian, she even had 4 years a girlfriend and all was fine for me, about 1 year ago they broke up.

About 1 month ago she was really depressed because she felt so alone and will be forever alone (like me) and told me (drunken) about her past and also about her sex life before she became a lesbian. Basically all her life she was abused to some point, some stories even sounded not really like rape but in that direction. She met some kinky hardcore BDSM people during that time. She told me about every single detail how she had sex and how disgusting it was.

That made me so sad and angry, I just wanted to puke. I felt so sorry for her going through all this and it traumatized me. Still.

I know her since 7 years, since I met her I never dated an other girl or found someone interesting. She still was always somehow the love of my life. I accepted that she is lesbian, but knowing all her sexlife with guys now, that just killed me.

Also thinking, if I would have just met her some months or years ago, maybe we would habe been a dream couple today. I am just so fucking angry about all that men who did all that to her.

I don't know what to do.
Since 1 month I always have images in my head  like her sucking dick, having threesomes or BDSM sessions and also riding a BBC.
I don't know how to handle this.

Those images are every das/night before my inner eye and I even dream about that. It just kills me 😭

I just feel so out of control of my emotions and thoughts all the time. When I wake up it’s like my head is blank until it isn’t, then it’s just full of every memory and thought from “reality” or like yesterday and I just feel so panicked. I feel angry a lot, and try not to get out of control or yell at my family/people. I alternate from so many crazy thoughts, like “I am certain I will kill myself one day, I fcking have to” “I hate myself I hate myself i HATE myself” and so much negativity and also sometimes I can’t help but think “I’m literally THE smartest person on the planet, I am special, no one can or ever will tell me different.” “I am going to change the world one day” I feel like the most dishonest person in the world but at the same time I don’t even wanna say that about me, because I don’t want to admit it to myself or let anyone else know how crazy I am. I make up the silliest lies and tell people, just because. I’ll lie about things I don’t need to lie about. I am also SO SCARED to tell my mom or dad or anyone really close to me about any of my true feelings about anything. Like I don’t want them to know even my favorite color, The thought of them being able to think about me and what I am thinking makes me ANGRY and uncomfortable and embarrassed and emotional and fearful like I just want to run away or scream and rip my throat out. But sometimes, I am so dramatic and opinionated and I want to talk to people all the time, I want the attention and questions about me and I want people to be obsessed with me. What the fvck is wrong with me, I feel like a psychopath. And i don’t mean that in an ignorant, “psychopath=murderer” way. No i understand what a psychopath is, they are manipulative and smart and sly and sneaky and sharp and apathetic and I am so afraid I am exactly that. But i don’t know who I even am. My feelings change so rapidly and i don’t know how to feel stable and secure with my own body and mind.

Im sorry that was a long rant. I am shaking and just so worried and exhausted of feeling so out of my mind. I feel like I don’t belong anywhere. If anyone’s out there reading still, just let me know anything. any tips or advice or does anyone relate?!??? :(

52,"i already had depression before quarantine. it really sucked, but i got through it because i could see my friends everyday and get distracted with work. i could just see people. sure, school right before quarantine was terrible for my mental health, but that’s a different story. i just can’t handle quarantine. at all. slowly, i’ve gotten more depressed. i haven’t seen my friends in months. i haven’t been able to do anything outside my home. it sucks. i’ve started stress eating, i’ve gained weight which only made me more upset, everything.

and online school. it’s a joke. it feels like nothing will happen if you don’t do it. and it’s a terrible mindset to be in. no motivation at all to do schoolwork. and i’m so tired. i’m exhausted, and i just want to sleep. not only that, but i want to cry and be held.

i want so bad to just be held by someone. one of my friends who i know will help me and support me. i feel like i’m always supporting them and never actually telling them about me. i just want it to be about me for once, as selfish as that sounds. i want to be held and to just cry. i want to cry forever and ever. i don’t want to stop. because quarantine is torture. my life is a mess right now and i don’t know what to do.

53,"Like any other 15 y/o kids, I have family and friends issue. Both are absolutely bothering me for a while now especially since we’re in quarantine. Me and a friend didn’t end up in good terms even before miss rona happened. Though she never addressed me directly, I’ve seen a handful of shady posts going around. Being the petty that I am, I addressed her directly on a post — sparking a more heated argument between us. Since the whole class knows about it, some of my classmates worsened the situation because everyone loves drama. Since I’ve started it, I told myself to finish it. Until there was no response from her so I totally looked clown. It was a big slap for me, honestly. So, I decided to go offline for a week to find peace of mind. 

While offline, I thought I’d be fine away from negativity but I was wrong. I started to have nightmares about my Dad and his mistress. It already happened a year ago but that time, I wasn’t really ready to forgive him but I had no choice. My mum forgave him (it happened a few times before and it always turned out like this) so I’d be a bad daughter who wants to ruin her own family. The emotional manipulation I had. That thought my mum would marry an abusive man like him. That thought it was me who broke our family because I just couldn’t forgive my dad got inside my head for a long time. So, I forgave him in order to fix our family. There was no new mistress after that but I always had nightmares since then. I tried to cope up using poetry but it didn’t help. That time, I also lost respect for him and he said I was bad for talk back when he made me lose respect for him but of course, he wasn’t ready for that. Now, I still have nightmares that I can’t talk to anyone. Not even to my mum because I don’t want to bother her. 

I’m only 15 but I can’t sleep at night without thinking my classmates talking about me or another mistress nightmare. I also decided to go offline again (I tried to go online yesterday) because my classmates keep worsening the petty argument but to kill boredom without phone, I’ve been doing bujo that my Dad doesn’t like.

55,"Hello,

I suffered an injury awhile back. I was heading to work and crossing the road at a stop sign when a car who was waiting to turn decided to move up and bumped me just below the lateral side (left side) of my knee ( about 2 inches below my knee) while my weight was on my leg. I quickly threw my torso onto his hood otherwise my knee would have snapped in half. I got off his hood, thought I was okay and kept going (big mistake :() I didn’t bother getting his info as I felt he hardly hit me and there was no pain and no swelling either. I was also late for work. My knee started to hurt the next day. 

1 and a half years later I am still suffering. My knee clicks when bending, I feel it catching but doesn’t lock, and my quad shrunk 4” in circumference compared to my other leg and it almost always aches.  I had an MRI using a 1.5 Tesla machine which confirmed mild myxoid degeneration in my medical meniscus and mild Chondromalacia behind my patella. I have not been able to run or play any sports ever since. There has never been any swelling.

I think the hardest part for me was letting the driver go. I beat myself up for it everyday and it makes me very depressed. I could have at least sued his insurance company and got a big settlement out of it. Now I’m stuck with a knee problem,depression and nothing. I felt so embarrassed at the time and shocked and just wanted to keep going. Every time I bring the story up to someone they respond by saying “you would have been set financially at least “ ... this is hard to hear. I think if my knee would have healed I would have got over it.

58,"TL;DR: my brother yells at his xbox all night and it’s triggering my sensory processing disorder and anxiety so hard and idk what to do.

So I’ve (20F) got a sensory processing disorder thing that mostly makes me very sensitive to sound and vibration. I moved home from my very quiet college apartment to my childhood room that’s next to my younger brother’s with a hollow wall between us. 

My brother came home from his 1.5 semesters of college an arrogant a-hole who happens to play xbox with his friends for ~12 hours of the day. This wouldn’t be a problem if he was just playing games or whatever but he’s always yelling at his friends and freaking out about the game from usually ~8pm to 5am. Sound travels really well in the house so every single member of my family has texted him at one point or another (my sister and I text him every night at least once) asking him to be quiet. He doesn’t usually listen but we like to try the same thing over and over again in naive hope. We’ve talked to him about it during the day and his only response is “I want to go back to Texas. Nobody judged me there!” which obviously is not an option and he was planning on coming home anyways to intern at the father’s company this summer (yay nepotism...). And he makes no changes.

At night is usually when I decompress, maybe quietly work on homework (I’m taking 5 classes over the summer), but between my brother yelling and my parents always having the tv on with the bass blasting right below my room, every night it gets harder and harder to not completely break down. There’s nowhere I can go to decompress. I can’t even find a quiet corner of a library because they’re all closed. I can’t go for a walk because everyone in the neighborhood is doing that and the “outdoors” just outside a big city isn’t exactly quiet, even in quarantine.

I hate confrontation and he gets angry and defensive really easily. I don’t know how to make him understand that it’s not an issue of judging him, it’s an issue of him not having the decency to realize he’s affecting other people and change his behavior accordingly and it’s severely affecting my mental health in a time when I actually need to legit be functioning.

I feel like there's no hope for me, mid twenties social retard and these are almost the only people I have to talk to on a regular basis. It's even worse I just get embarrassed and shut down around other people because I guess I just feel no one wants to hear what I have to say.

Doesn't matter what I'm trying to talk about, could be anything, deep or surface level, they will say ""Oh ok"" and talk about what they want to talk about.

Some explaining 

I woke up this morning covered in ice cream, not knowing where it came from, I immediately went to wash it off and clean it up but I was mad. My mother came up stairs wondering what all the fuss was about i asked about the ice cream all over my bed and she said she didnt have any idea where it came from but she sat there and laughed at me, while I'm sitting here pissed that I have to clean an entire bed because someone poured ice cream on me 

The issue 
She started laughing and calling me a liar and all this and that, so as soon as I heard that I was a liar I snapped and told her that it wasnt mine, she proceeded to push my buttons more and my mind was already imagining horrible things, 

I took her by the neck, drug her into the kitchen grabbed one of our largest knives threw her on the ground and said anyone can die at any moment just remember that

They burn my possessions, dont do as they say, even if they want you to kill a baby mouse on a sticky trap with a BB gun and splatter its blood all over your face?  you gotta listen or you'll be homeless!

For Two weeks after, my hopelessness, anxiety, etc, etc, was the worst it could ever be. After the really bad of it stopped and I could actually manage.

75,"So every time I have been supposedly hypomanic I have also coincidentally not been sleeping hardly enough. Partly I don’t sleep because I get insomnia sometimes, but partly because I don’t feel like going to sleep and stay up super late and might function on 5-6 hrs for a month or so. During and after that are the periods when I get ‘unwell’. Like, very embarrassing perverted horniness, minor obsessions that usually don’t go anywhere or hurt me, fleeting creativeness, and getting called weird and hyper by people I know. Also have done risky dangerous things that have hurt me physically and socially during those times, but I was drinking. 

What I am thinking about is, how can they attribute all of this to a disorder when there are so many other factors that can explain it. I wasn’t sleeping because I chose not to. The times when I got really ‘out of control’ often involved alcohol, to the point where my friends told me I was acting over the top WHEN I WAS DRINKING, not all of the time. Does this make sense to anyone?? I don’t usually get out of control with alcohol but when I haven’t been sleeping it has happened. Yes I was irritable and also a little hyper/giddy but isn’t that a completely normal response to sleep deprivation? 

The other thing too. I don’t really ‘crash’ after those periods. I do get depressed sometimes, but I don’t crash from those times of sleep deprivation and the resulting loopyness. I thought you had to crash to depression for it to be mania, but by that logic I clearly don’t have mania, as I returned to normal sleep and functioning gradually.

Not trying to boast but I am an attractive guy and in high school girls would come up to me and just chat and later on I’d get their number and we hung out. I had many girlfriends and even older women in stores or at the mall while waiting on line would just compliment me. Throughout my life I was known as the attractive kid. Well idk if this affected me mentally or not but no matter what I do I need to be around attractive people or woman. I’d chose a college major and see that in my science classes lots of attractive people and it make me feel better while upper level math classes it would just be the typical types of people. Is there a condition of this type like idk why this happens to me it’s like subconscious. I feel like if I were to work at a job there should be attractive ppl working otherwise I wouldn’t do it as I can’t surrounded myself with those types of ppl. Is this a real issue? How could have this all started? Can I get this to go away. I feel like my choices I make in life is on this factor and many others but mainly this. I am just lost. Despite being a guy I feel like mentally a girl who is looked at and can be used wrongly meaning if a older guy looks at me, for some odd reason I think of myself as a girl and wow he’s looking at me what a creep but I’m actually a buff dude. Is this a mental illness? I would be in upper math classes working with people who aren’t good looking and fat or slobs and see them and perceive it as if they were looking at a girl. I am so lost on how this happened to me. What could this mean ? Could this be porn related?",12May2020,1

78,I've always had this weird fantasy from a very young age where after being slighted I thought of committing suicide. I wouldn't think of doing it because I actually wanted to die or was depressed. Rather in this fantasy I did it because I wanted to get back at those who wronged me. I took relief and almost pleasure from thinking of how they would regret their decision and how I would love to see it. I never actually tried to commit suicide nor did I even come close. However I recognize that this thinking to such an extent isn't normal. Can it be attributed to any Mental Health conditions? Thank you,12May2020,1
79,"I recently dropped out of college. I was taking a course in IT which I did not want to do( parents thought it would be more practical) and was failing. With an overachiever's mindset, the tendecy to fail to grasp the subject over and over again made me go to a really dark place, I started cutting again, the last time I did that was when I was 17 when I was still in highschool. I thought it best to step back for a moment and figure out what's going on. It was at that moment that the option to drop out became all the more 'common sense', and it was alright for a while, but there's a little bit more of information that tends to make my situation a little bit complicated.

Firstly, I don't stay on campus, the living conditions there are desperately beyond squalor, and I'm not saying that to be dramatic, it's literally bad, reason why most students have taken to living in studio apartments that go for cheap outside campus grounds.

Secondly, I have a little problem of articulating whatever issues I may have to another individual in a manner that's understandable, most times I may over explain something or leave something out, I can't tell if it's on purpose or not.
At the time I was under the suicidally depressive episode, contemplating whether I should tell my parents that I did not wish to continue with the course designated to me and therefore render whatever efforts they had invested in me till that moment absolutely null and void, my grandma died.
Now, I wouldn't define the relationship between me and my grandma to be that close. We had fun whenever me and my mom would visit her over the holidays but that was about it. Then came the news that she was sick. Everyone from the extended family came together in show of support, but her health was undeniably taking a toll, you could see her slowly fading away. She could no longer walk even with the help of her stick and had to be carried along wherever she needed to be by a caregiver. I had never encountered death in this way, I had never seen how it brought people together. The last few days before she passed, she was with family, and even though there was a certain projected optimistic mood, the certainty of her eventual death was a constant looming shadow.
I don't know why this moment stood out to me so strongly, as in that moment, I decided to make the decision to go out and follow what I wanted to do as opposed to what my parents thought was practical.
When the news came that she passed, it didn't really come as a surprise, but at the same time there was some latent anxiety I could not quite explain. I was afraid so very much often that I would not leave the house for days at times (the studio apartment outside campus grounds). I didn't know what to do, but I thought it wise to tell the truth to those closest to me, my family.

So I sat my mom down and told her that I wanted to drop out of college and instead pursue a study in being a creative (things related to film, animation, writing and directing). I showed her my IT transcript for my results, and she was disappointed at the failure that I'd become (the grades were really bad, a lot of D minuses). I felt myself a failure but moreso, I just wanted an ease to the conflict that I was going through at that moment. She was not in the least bit interested in entertaining my idea even for a second, immediately calling my dad who basically followed suit and ordered me to weather through to the end no matter what ( this was after I had revealed to both my mom and dad that I do indeed cut myself and was in need of help, their response to it being that 'Everyone has issues', which is a position I understand knowing where they're coming from).
So I took the decision to drop out of college into my own hands, without telling them.

PART 2:
They don't know I'm not attending class. I'm trying to hone my skills in film editing, sound editing, graphic design, photography and writing (there are two manuscripts in progress I hope to get published).
I am not making any money yet and haven't been for a few months now. I've become more compulsive, with my introversion excersabated by the lockdown as a result of the covid pandemic. My mood changes are becoming more eratic with a sense of guilt compounding with each passing day, as every waking moment, I can't help but feel that I am commiting a great atrocity to my parents and to the expectations of my entire family who a majority are academics in some form of way and value the status of academic accolades above everything else. I don't know what their reaction will be when they find out what I did, but I am certain it will not be a good reaction.
The day I told my mom that I was dropping out, she told me that I was breaking her heart at that moment. I don't think I've ever felt such kind of pain upon hearing that. I wasn't doing it to scorn her in some way, I just needed someone, just anyone to listen for a moment, but it turns out that just because something is true, doesn't mean it needs to be heard. I went back into playing the role of the 'good son' image they had of me. We talk every other week and each time they call, I make up 'progress' I am 'achieving' in my field of study. There is no one I can truly tell how I feel. Every time I see someone, there's always the knee jerk reaction to present a certain type of 'face'. I have been really engrossed in my writing, it seems to be one of the few ways I can make sense of reality anymore ( which is probably ironic because most of what I write is fiction). 
This was supposed to be my final year, but with the pandemic I suppose it would technically be next year, or whenever it will be safe to open up schools again.
It is not a question of 'if' but 'when' they will find out. With all the lies I've told and the accumulated guilt I fear I may not be strong enough to confront them with the truth, after the reaction I received from trying to speak truth the first time.
I was in a better place, mentally, I wasn't cutting anymore and was actually geared towards achieving a goal I had set in mind. Now with time dragging on and the inevitable end wherein I will have to reveal the truth slowly approaches, what I was feeling ages ago and I had thought I had resolved by doing what I thought was right and what I wanted to do, I am beginning to feel again.
I wouldn't exactly call it depression, but just more of an unwillfull surrender to whatever may come be.
By writing this extended thread, there's obviously an element of intrinsic self preservation here as I try and formulate my permanent 'exit plan.'
I'm turning to the advice of strangers on the internet because I literally have no one I can talk to about this. Some subjects are still taboo to talk about, especially when it comes to family problems and mental health. This is my first time posting what is only a cry for help, on the internet. Some options on what I could do may seem pretty common sense to a second party, maybe I'm just not seeing them yet.

I'm a pathological liar. I constantly have to make people feel bad for me. I dont know why I do it and I have no regret after I do it. I know its wrong, and I know what I'm doing, but I just dont care. I've lied about being dead, I've lied about attempting suicide, I've lied about being in the hospital and having fatal injuries. Ive lied about cutting my wrists and ended up actually doing it after awhile just so people would give me pity. Things that are major. I dont know if I do it for attention from the one person I lie to, or if my brain thinks its nice to watch someone feel worried about me and cry. Ive lied about being abused by my parents even though they've never layed a hand on me before. and I've even lied about being r*ped when I was young. I didnt give a name or put any specific person on the spot, but I lied about it to see what kind of reaction my bf would have. He obviously sobbed. My fucked up brain likes that I do that to people. I've lied about having schizophrenia and hearing and seeing things. I'm manipulative because I for some reason want to feel like someone is worried about me and that they care over and over and over. I don't know why I do it. I really dont. Its who I am and I've built a fake life that all my friends and boyfriend think is true. I dont know what to do. I dont know why this happens. I dont know exactly why I do it and I know I'm a very shitty person for this but I just dont care. Theres this side of me that cares and wants to make it stop but the other side of me enjoys it and I can't stop and I cant control it. Please help me. What should I do. I need advice on how to change this because I know I'm hurting people and I want to stop. I'm crying so hard while writing this because I dont understand why I'm like this. Every time someone points out something shitty about how I act, I always make up this stupid excuse like ""it's just how I was raised"" or something alot more dark. None of it is true.

83,"At the moment as of typing my story, I’m 15 and I find myself more self-conscious as I get older in my teen years as I get closer to reaching adulthood. The main reason why I find myself getting more self-conscious as I get older is because, my speech is not completely clear enough to understand every single word I say. The leading cause for this issue is that my jawline is not completely straight. When I was in Year 6 (I think I was 11 or 12 at the time), me and my mum went to the dentist to get a check-up and they told us that I need braces because my jawline and teeth aren’t completely straight. So a few weeks later or so (I don’t remember exactly when in Year 6), we went back and they started to take pictures of my teeth and they got me to put this clay like-thing in my mouth so they can get a more accurate idea of where all my teeth are. So, after all of the normal things you have to go through before getting braces, we than were given how much it would cost. They said it would cost around $7000 -$8000 (could be more now since it has been a few years and my teeth may have gotten worse) and then this is where my life starts to crumble down as I start to picture what my future could look like. My parents started to argue about the cost of the braces and plus to make it even worse, my dad believes that braces do not work. Before you start hating on him, I will tell you the story to why he thinks this. Okay so he has a sister who was in a car accident and her teeth were chipped and some of her teeth needed replacing and fixed. However, she also needed braces to straighten up her teeth. When she finally got her braces off, a few years later, her teeth started to go back to how her teeth use to be, which was being a bit crooked and not straight. Anyway, her jawline was straight though so that is the main difference between me and his sister. So this led him to believe that braces don’t work because of what ended up happening to his sister’s teeth a few years later. Okay so back to where we were, he ended up asking me if I needed/wanted braces (definitely needed them) and I stupidly said no. Looking back at it now, I think saying no was a good response. The reason for this is that they ended up stop arguing which was a great thing, but in the long time, I had to suffer with not being able to do what I want to do because of how much more I’ve became self-conscious about who I really am. There’re many secrets that I haven’t told anyone because I’m afraid of my family knowing. Two secrets (which are probably the only two secrets I have) is that firstly, I am bi but I would say I’m 80% towards the gay side. My second secret is that when I do get older and I can do things more privately since I will be able to travel to places by myself, I’m into the whole furry community. I know some people may not like furries, but hey, I am into the whole dressing up as a furry and being who I really want to be but out in the public in certain furry events such as ‘furdu’ which is an Australian furry con that happens at the Gold Coast every year. There’s so many things that I’ve kept to myself, but not being able to be who I really am is actually causing me to feel more nervous and self-conscious about myself. I know many people have been through things like this before or even currently, but the big thing that I want fixed in my life is my teeth and jawline. I want to be able to feel like a normal person and even though each and one of us are different, I just want to be able to talk fluently without criticism and live the life I want to be able to live. I want to be able to go to an interview for a job and have confidence when speaking to the employer. I keep saying want, but I should’ve said I need. I need these things to live a life that I want to have, not a life that I don’t want to have. To every single person reading this, I just want to say, we all have our fair share of tough times and to get through them can be difficult, especially when it involves money (for one of my issues). We all know that we will be able to get through tough times, but we need to find the main source of these problems to identify what is causing this issue in the first place.

85,"Just thought I should share this. As this kind of story would give me hope, or it would’ve just days ago. This isn’t too crazy either. Just thought y’all would enjoy this.

For months, Edging on 2 years I had been searching for purpose. Looked for love, looked for religion, looked for a high that felt just right. Experienced heart break, pain and withdrawal. I had been put on a couple medications for depression to help ease the pain. They all helped but didn’t solve the underlying issue. Lack of purpose. That’s basically the gist of it, but there isn’t a way to explain hardship without also feeling the same demons. Anyways. Just minutes ago, I had watched a movie. One that isn’t meant for an awakening neither. Just one that caught my eye. As I was watching it suddenly, like a click, I felt something change inside me. A strong feeling of calmness over came me. I began to cry and life just made sense to me. Im at ease with life’s hardships. I feel fresh and happy. I will enjoy life from here on out. Thanks for reading (:

86,"Sorry, this got out of hand long, there's a tl;dr. I just feel like I'm going insane and need to vent. If anyone could give advice or commiserate I would really appreciate it. Conversations about this IRL have been very frustrating, it feels like no one in my life is taking me seriously about this. I am not asking for a diagnosis, I understand that's not what this sub is for. Just, does anyone relate? If you have similar experiences either with the symptoms or with the diagnostic process please let me know how it turned out and what is helpful to you.

I am a college student in NJ and self-dx'd with ADHD probably about three years ago. But... I just got a whole battery done at a specifically ADHD clinic and they gave me the thumbs down. I'm willing to consider that I'm wrong but none of the professionals I talk to will give me ANY suggestions that aren't depression or sleep deprivation. I know both those things mess with executive dysfunction, but a) I'm in treatment for depression and have not seen even a sliver of improvement with this and b) the issue persists exactly as bad over the summer when I've gotten enough sleep for months.

I am seriously SO close to finally flaming out and failing at school and personal care so badly it comes with serious consequences. Are multiple psychs maybe wrong or is there some other potential dx I don't know about? This is what I'm talking about:

* Unbelievably, cartoonishly extreme difficulty getting started at tasks, particularly when they seem overwhelming, difficult, or I don't immediately know the first steps, to the point where I have not infrequently pulled an all nighter trying to convince myself to start a task for 16+ hours straight and then STILL gone to bed without doing it in the end. Actually probably doing that again right after posting this
* Very difficult to quit doing something when I get too into it - will for instance ignore thirst for several hours if I am really enjoying a book, and I often shoot right through fun activities like games or books that would normally be done over several days in just one or a few 4+ hour sittings, to the detriment of getting anything else done
* Also extreme difficulty keeping track of responsibilities - struggle to use a planner or any other planning tools because I forget to use/check them too. Show up late to over half of engagements, won't make appointments I really should unless reminded several times, lose track of even when events I really want to go to are supposed to happen.
* Cannot sustain attention for longer than maybe 10 minutes if I'm not really enjoying myself or in a very good mood generally
* Literally never do anything, from chores to applications to assignments, until the absolute last second and experience epic burnout that makes me turn stuff in late at least once a month. The anxiety/blockage/whatever about starting tasks has to be overcome by distress before I can get off my ass. Like, when I have to cook for myself and there's nothing that's premade I won't do it until I can't ignore the pain. And I completely missed the entire recruiting season for internships because I was so blocked off about putting in applications.
* Mood dysregulation more so than depression honestly. I get easily upset and/or angry about the news, minor setbacks, etc, so it often feels like I spend my whole life in a terrible mood. Especially because I always have an impossible amount of work hanging over me! I feel like when talking to health professionals they immediately zero in on this and also that my depression was much worse in like... middle school? It's been 9 years. Related, I either cry or start freaking out defensively when people sternly criticize me or are just mean to me, which objectively makes me kind of hilarious to tease :/ I feel hurt for days or weeks when anyone insults me, even online where we all know that happens a lot.
* Lose important shit, permanently or lose track of it and have to tear up my room to find it, on a legitimately almost daily basis. As we speak I'm missing my normal pair of glasses, a USB with some important data on it, and one of my makeup brushes.
* My personal spaces always look like there's just been a home invasion, no matter how pure my intentions are going in. Can't muster the will to clean it except for once every like 6 months when I seriously can't even fit my laptop on my desk anymore, and then it looks terrible again within the week. This and losing everything obviously feed into each other.
* Can't act normal in conversations - either don't say anything at all or constantly talk over everyone else. Comes out online and in text via unending word spewage, as you may have noticed.

My test results for the ADHD battery came back for the most part with function depressed where you would expect it to be but not enough to be diagnostic. I can give more details if that's important.

Ok, that was a shitload of background. My actual questions for you guys are:

- Is there a nonzero chance the clinic was wrong? I usually wouldn't doubt actual specialists this hard, I just NEED an explanation. What are signs that the process was done well, or maybe that they missed something?

- Is there a nonzero chance that I'm wrong and I just need to get the right SSRI and some sleep and this will go away?

- If you have or had symptoms like these, what helps you, and if you have one and don't mind sharing, what's your diagnosis?

- Wtf is my next step? I feel so lost. The ADHD clinic suggested I try CBT. I'm willing to try it, I guess, but I don't think this can be boiled down to ""distorted thinking"" either. Like I feel like it would be treating a few symptoms but not the cause, same as regular talk therapy.

TFL;DR: My executive function is absolute shit tier and it's about to finally actually ruin my life after years of scraping by. Keep getting told it's not ADHD, but the DSM-5 description of ADHD-PI and explanations of RSD feel like they're written by someone psychoanalyzing me personally, and I'm not hearing any other suggestions. What do I do from here? I really want help and can't seem to get it. Is it possible this all is just because I have an irredeemably lazy personality???

87,"Since r/psychology only allows for links and images, this is the next best place to ask this question. I look at some people in my life and some people on the internet and they have no grasp of reality whatsoever. People who genuinely believe that they're the best and everybody else is lesser and if you try to convince them otherwise it's because you're stupid or mentally ill. I'm friends with dudes who've had compliments thrown their way all their life and they still have a fair or low self esteem, so idk if they're just different or that's just not the only reason that's why that happens. Another thing that I noticed is that these people are OBSESSED with proving that they're right. They'll go through major lengths to prove they're right, no matter how trivial the subject (I'm unfortunately friends with one of these people, I just ignore him when something like this happens). Is a massive ego a form of mental illness? If not, I'd still like to know the list of things that cause this.

Of course, he lives across the country and I would never do anything bad (even though these feelings have manifested negatively in person years ago). Well, he added his Instagram link on TikTok, so I go on there. I like a post of his and he immediately blocks me. I get really depressed and start spiraling. I make a TikTok post saying I did nothing wrong and he randomly blocked me. His username was on my post so he gets harassed by strangers. He decides to unblock me and talk to me. He was actually super helpful, but obviously I was being toxic so it was clear he would block me again. Now I'm just in bed, rambling... I'm not feeling too bad about it now. I just want to know, is intense feeling of jealousy and clinginess over someone I don't know a mental health problem? Jealous because he didn't ever follow me back and didn't like all of my comments but would like other people's comments that said the same things. It's definitely a problem. I don't know what the steps are to get over it though. I've been this way since as long as I can remember too... please help.",12May2020,1
99,"Hi everyone, there’s something on my mind that has been bothering me.
Let’s say, completely hypothetically speaking of course:
A person can be completely emotionally involved in the world and the people around them, but in an instant become completely apathetic and disconnected. This loss of feeling and emotion applies to the person’s own self as well as the world around them— and can cause very self destructive internal and social behavior. It is like a switch is turned on/off and the person swings from someone who cares too much to not at all. 

Is there a name for this swing/behavior? I have tried looking this up but I’ve had no luck.",12May2020,1
100,"Hi! Sorry but this isn’t really a big issue for me but I wanted to get some advice. I am very against self-diagnosis and understand that I can’t treat myself so please let me know if this post offends anyone. Anyways so Obsessive compulsive disorder has been popping up a lot recently, whether it be in a tv show, conversation or online and as someone was explaining what OCD is, it occurred to me that it seemed similar to my “ritual” before I go to sleep and during the day. Every night for the past 4 years I repeat this saying over and over again to make sure my family and pets don’t pass away. It would mess with my head if I did it in the wrong order or think about someone more than another person. This pretty much caused me to get very upset. Lately I don’t do it as often, but when my exams and stressful periods of the year occur, it would make me feel worse and make me more inclined to do it. Similar also happens during the day like if I touch anything I have to wash my hands, if an object didn’t feel right I have to make sure it does by repeatedly touching it and if I (for example) don’t wash up my dishes after using them, my parents would pass away. 

Sorry for the long read and honestly I feel so bad thinking I have a slight chance of having it since there are people actually struggling with disorders. I see everywhere to “see someone if you think your struggling with issues” so I’m not sure if I’m overreacting about this or if I should see someone. 
Also please don’t get angry at me for this post, I’m not as educated about mental health :((",12May2020,1

My thoughts get messed up &amp; distort things to being worse. But I usually handle it by taking time to myself. She has a problem with feeling like she is always going to be abandoned and left. So, when we talked this evening I was getting frustrated with her short replies and just said nvm. She throws some paragraphs my way &amp; she has this way with words that makes me feel like a shit person &amp; I should take all the blame for everything. And told me because of my PTSD she carries baggage from it - let me be clear - this relationship was founded off of friendship &amp; online &amp; for only a few months even though we became inseparable. We have only had two disputes. But yet... my PTSD effects her? How? She made me feel like I was hard to love and toxic and that no matter how much I tried to show affection the best way I could it was never enough. Her breaking off with me was very robotic, and she kept pointing out every time I raised my voice or expressed any type of emotion. Because I’m a human basically.

104,"Hi,

That's the first time I'm trying to explain what's happening to me, so I'm not really sure where to start, but i need help and i don't know what can i do.

I'm 21, and I always used to be an average person, with a good family, i also have a pretty nice job as a programmer in a ""prestigious"" company (even tho my salary is very low, but I don't have financial problems). But 3-4 years ago, when i was still studying, I started feeling really bad with myself.

I'm not sure how to explain it, i just started feeling very bad, and in 1 year or so, my grades dropped from one of the bests of my class to failing half of the subjects. Not because they were hard but I just wasn't doing anything at all, even if I wanted to, i just couldn't. Somehow i managed to pass all the subjects except of two, because instead of going to class i just stayed in bed doing nothing or just crying. Here's when I noticed that i need help, but it's just not that easy, I'll try to explain it later.

I started working shortly after all this started, but i still could managed it quite well by then.

As i said it's been something like 3-4 years since then, and it has only gotten worse. Now I'm in a moment that i just can't keep going by myself. I can't work anymore. I'm doing by myself some big projects for very important clients and i just can't do it, when i start working i feel very very very anxious and i just can't think. If this keeps going I'm sure I'll lose my job. But my job isn't the problem, it's me. I have very nice job conditions and this anxiety or whatever isn't coming from my job. I'm also trying to get those 2 subjects from my studies and it's very easy, but when i try to work on it, i just freeze. I have no idea how to explain it...

The main reason because i haven't went to a professional yet, it's because of my family. They've been through a lot, and i just dont want to add more bad stuff in their lives. I never spoke with anyone about this, and i dont plan to. And i just dont know how could i see a professional without letting them know.

I know that all this sounds really stupid, and maybe it is, but i just can't keep going anymore. I don't know what's wrong with me. I also don't know if this post will help me on anything, but I need to do something now before it gets worse.

108,"I'd even go so far as to say spiritual, and I do *not* consider myself spiritual or religions (anymore). 

I was feeling like shit, borderline suicidal, and since I'm living with my parents for the time being, I had to get out of the house to feel through my emotions in private. And it was just... the most compelling feeling of peace I've experienced in a long time. Something about the music throbbing while I drove through a really heavy fog, with the streetlights glowing through it just got my thoughts flowing freely like warm butter.

I won't jump the gun and say I'm cured, but I did just resist some self destructive habits, and I'm now doing the coursework that I've been putting off at risk of failing out of school because I *just. didn't. have the energy for it*... So even if I wake up next week and I'm worse off and I feel silly for being optimistic, at least I got a precious window of peace and lucidity that helped me to at least pass the semester.

Oh, and getting pulled over! I was so absorbed with my thoughts, I was doing the drive on autopilot thing - see and react to things like red lights and sudden movements, but not really think about where I'm going. I was just navigating by instinct and I ended up going too far on a road and heading for the military base just outside town. Turns out, military cops don't really like it when you suddenly show up in the middle of the night, then suddenly freak out, turn around, drive on the wrong side of the road for a minute, then correct yourself and try to leave thinking nobody saw you being silly and stupid. 

Anyway, the guy that pulled me over was just a really genuine human. He asked me how my night was going and I just explained the whole thing, the need to get out and clear my head, the reason I was too distracted to see the big ass signs about it being a military base (that's also due to the fog, it was really intense in my defense), all of it. Probably sounded like a nervous wreck. He was really empathetic, and let me off with a warning. 

The funny thing is, I spent a while beating myself up, thinking ""man, this guy must think I'm some sort of stupid weak kid. He's a responsible ass adult, working a job in public safety, and here he is, having to chase down a stupid kid with a panic issue. All because I can't properly process my feelings.""

But I considered it for a bit, and I realized that this random cop, who doesn't owe me anything, who's shift I rudely interrupted, saw me in one of my worst states and still had it in him to treat me kindly and *listen* to me. And I realized that I haven't been doing that for myself. 

Guys, see, I need to treat myself with the same empathy and sincerity that this cop treated me with. I need to listen to myself, and forgive myself even when I'm in my worst states. Because the only way to leave those states is with love and support, and when I'm not lucky enough to have this cop around, I need to provide that love and support for myself.  I think, for the first time in a long time, I can cut the cynicism for one little moment and tell myself *it's gonna be okay...* and actually mean it.",12May2020,1

110,"I hate writing long posts. Or anything at all. I expect that this will get only a few replies which won't help me, probably. 

&amp;#x200B;

**DPDR and other stuff**

I have had DPDR (depersonalization/derealization disorder) for about 1.5 years. It hasn't been diagnosed or anything, I don't go to the doctor for these kinds of things because it feels weird. Maybe I wouldn't find the words to describe my issues and I would be labeled as a perfectly healthy human being, even though I know that I have some issues. It sounds kinda stupid talking about it.

""I have issues"". Like everyone else in the fucking world. Every 12 year old with a loving family and an overall good freaking life has ""depressions"" now, apparently. I kinda sound like an asshole probably, but, whatever. Or like some kinda redneck dude on Facebook. What's an asshole anyway. Why do we use that specific word to describe people who don't fit the norm in some kind of way? I don't know.

It has been getting worse. I feel like my body is doing everything automatically and my ""soul"", so to say, is on another layer or something. I don't know. It's hard to describe things. When I wake up it doesn't feel any different than when I was sleeping. Looking back at things is like thinking about a dream I have had. Everything feels like a dream. Everything is so objective. It feels like taking nitrous oxide. So ""disassociated"". Like the song ""Revolution 9"", maybe. Or not. Probably? Maybe ""Drowse"".

I don't get any excitement from food. I can objectively say that the food tastes good, but I feel nothing when eating. It used to bring me lots of joy. I don't really care how I look. I used to. I shaved my head. I don't work out anymore. I don't really feel attracted to any of the two genders.

I think with DPDR you can really experience the ""absurd"". I am a nihilist. And I don't think ""normal"" people can actually say that they fully understand that. The meaningless universe and the absurd.

**School and motivation**

I don't brush my teeth or shower very often now. At least since my ""condition"" has worsened. Damn, what if nobody reads this, and I have wasted my time. Whatever. What a nice word. Whatever.

We have to do a lot of stuff for school. Stuff I think is stupid. I am studying IT. So I can understand why I have to do a lot of stuff for programming class but history? (Which I have had for like 5 years already, I know basic history). Oh yeah, I go to school in Austria. High school. Anyway. Chemistry, accounting, business administration... I have to put in hours of work to complete the assignments. I don't even care about what I learn in those classes. I want to be a programmer, not a fucking accountant. And I don't see how high school-level accounting will help me pursue my programming career.

So I just gave up. I don't even have the motivation to talk to the teachers about it. I don't do any assignments and will probably have to ""repeat the year"" (translated 1:1 from german, doesn't make sense probably. I don't know how it works in the US or UK or whatever, but basically means that I have to be a sophomore again.) 

But school is not the worst. I don't have the motivation to get up from bed. I will just lie there for hours and hours after waking up, to about like 4 or 5 PM. I will maybe be on my phone. When I am in my room, which is on the 2nd floor, and I get hungry, I am too lazy to go down the stairs to get me something to eat, so I just ""starve"". Too lazy to clean my room. I talked to my mother about it and she said it's because I don't go outside that often, but I do.

I am at my friend's house a lot. We smoke some weed and take nitrous and all kinds of stupid things. But I don't think those things have worsened my condition. I have had DPDR before ever trying weed.

I used to get very anxious when thinking about my school issues. Or death. Not any more. Not really.

Basically since my teen years my home life has always been an issue with my motivation and progress in life. I've been kicked out of my home several times (usually for 2 weeks at a time) for not doing little things like ONLY washing my own dishes and not everyone else's, or using 3 towels in a month, etc., during some important life events such as my high school graduation, Christmas, my birthday, etc. My situation with that has gotten much better though especially finally understanding how much my own mother has scarified for me but it is always in the back burner. However, especially since I live in a dense city and in a neighbourhood that 'isn't the best', bugs have a recurrent issue. Bedbugs and cockroaches specifically. I can't sleep at night with the lights off for I fear that a bug will crawl onto me after seeing one on my bed and another in my bedroom desk and am constantly anxious about them during the days to the point that I haven't eaten much for the past for days (drinking 1 cup of water + 1 meal during the day) for I fear that they were in the food. Since I'm a university student, it's taking a toll on my tasks that I have to do and my overall health. It's specially worse because of the pandemic, so now I'm anxious about the virus and the bugs. My home was meant to feel safe from the virus but now I'm afraid of the bugs. I've had issues with cockroaches before in my teen years (so for several years) before we moved and after 5 years without them I felt so relived. Now they're back in one of the worst times. I'm considering taking in more loans, adding to my 35k loans + another 10k more for school already, to move out much closer to my school, but I really don't want to spend so much. I know I'm not meant to compare my situation with other's (or at least not that much), but so many people are in worse living conditions that me during the quarantine, but I still feel so distraught about it. Chances are we'll have to call an exterminator into our home and I fear that they'll bring in the virus since they'll have to touch a lot of out stuff, and that the bugs issue won't be completely resolved.

Now that I'm 17 I basically have never seen my friends cry over anything and here I'm crying in class because I can't keep up with the assignments in Arabic class... 

Even though now I don't visibly cry as often as when i was in elementary school, sometimes when doing tasks that are somewhat stressful i would be holding back tears to make sure i don't cry and embarrass myself. 

One example of this was when i was learning how to ride a motorcycle (because its one of the main method of transportation here and is an important skill to know) I was unable to focus on the road and on controlling the motorcycle which was stressing me out and now I'm trying to not cry which just made it even harder to focus on anything. The thing is that the motorcycle was not supposed to be very difficult to learn, but the fact that I'm having a very hard time focusing and also holding back tears from the stress just made it extra difficult to learn...

1. DHD's trademark hyperfocus is a serious advantage — if you can effectively channel all that attention and energy into work that makes a difference. “Many scientists, writers, and artists with [ADHD](https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-adhd-symptoms-causes-treatments/) have had very successful careers, in large part because of their ability to focus on what they’re doing for hours on end,”

But people with ADHD excel at pushing past setbacks, adapting new strategies, and moving forward better than ever.

3. Individuals with ADHD are bright, creative, and funny — often using self-depreciating humor to remind that world that perfection is wholly uninteresting. They’ve faced challenges, learned novel ways to manage their symptoms, and developed a sense of humility and self-respect along the way. All these traits add up to a person that is a pleasure to be around, and brightens others’ days with her warmth. 
4. Barbara, an *ADDitude* reader from Virginia, writes that the thing she loves most about her son is “his generosity and his desire to please those he cares about. He is so protective of his younger sister.” Individuals with ADHD love to make people happy, whether it’s by sharing a cookie or inviting a friend to cry on their shoulder.
5. We're able to harness that ADHD creativity in strange and wonderful ways. *ADDitude*contributor Linda Roggli struggled with filing her papers alphabetically. So she came up with her own system. “The associations in my head are one-of-a-kind,” she says. “If my brain thinks of life insurance policies and bicycle warranties the same way, that’s how I file them. When I return to that folder, I’ll find them both.” Whatever works for us, right? 
6. After living with accommodations — or perhaps struggling without them — people with ADHD know that “fair” doesn’t always mean “equal.” They understand that different people need different things to succeed, and they’re committed to helping whomever they can. 
7. Thomas Edison — who probably had ADHD — put all his efforts toward inventing the light bulb, even when it seemed impossible. In the end, it took him more than 3,000 tries before he made a functioning light bulb, but the victory was immeasurably sweet because he had to risk a lot — and fail even more — to make it work. 
8. As *ADDitude* blogger Allison Larkin points out, “Acting on impulse sometimes results in wonderful things.” A totally unplanned drive to New England in the middle of a snowstorm brought her to the town she would fall in love with, and later move to. Find out what your spontaneity can do for you 
9. Well-adjusted people with ADHD have learned to use humor to cope with difficult situations, great and small. Need proof? Head over to [Alison Larkin's](https://www.additudemag.com/author/alison-larkin/) page to see how this comedienne uses humor to deal with life’s challenges. 
10. Finding money (or clothing, or a tasty snack) that you forgot about earlier makes life a string of pleasant surprises — who knows what you’ll uncover next?! 
11. “Spontaneity, outside-the-box creativity, and heightened energy” — all traits of people with ADHD — “add pizzazz to romantic interludes.” [Adults with ADHD](https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-in-adults/) are known for showering their partners with affection — and forever believing in the power of love, even when their relationships hit a bump in the road. 
12. One thing is certain — with ADHD, there’s never a quiet moment! Your constantly racing brain is always leading you toward new topics of discussion and questions of great import; awkward lulls in the conversation are virtually nonexistent. 
13. Though we often struggle in school or in social situations without adequate help, people with ADHD are known for their compassion toward others and willingness to lend a hand. As proud momma Dee Boling said after her son was awarded Student of the Month, “I’d rather have a kind, cooperative kid than a smart aleck who gets straight As without trying.” 
14. [Lisa Aro's](https://www.additudemag.com/author/lisa-aro/) daughter has ADHD, dyslexia, [sensory processing disorder](https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-sensory-processing-disorder/) — and she can only see out of one eye. Does she let any of this stop her? Nope! As her mother writes to her, “You write, draw, paint, film, act, invent, create, and dream. You set your sights on something and do it. No disability has stopped you from pursuing what you want.” Thousands of other persistent people with ADHD do the same every single day. 
15. Famous people with ADHD include singer Justin Timberlake, chef Alexis Hernandez, and comedian Howie Mandel — not to mention dozens of others! People with ADHD are often highly intelligent and creative, and these famous faces prove that your diagnosis will only hold you back if you let it. 
16.  High energy is contagious. When those around you see your drive, passion, and knack for out-of-the-box thinking, they’ll be inspired to push for their goals as well. 
17. Being Highly Organized, Punctual, and Generally Responsible       Ha! Gotcha xD",12May2020,1

131,"I (26F) have had a pretty rough life. Between an abusive upbringing and many many many health issues, I’ve been in therapy for years. I’d say over the past 5 years I’ve developed a pretty bad addiction to food that I am trying my hardest to break. 


I’ve been talking with my therapist but she hasn’t really been helpful and I even went to a psych finally to get on medication to help my chronic depression. I’m now taking Trintellix and I’ve felt wonders better, but I still lean on food to make me feel something positive. Because of this I’ve put on 50 lbs in a year. I’m the heaviest I’ve ever been and I don’t see myself stopping. Whenever I try to limit what I eat, or swap everything for something healthier I become physically ill. It feels like withdrawal.


I become dizzy and very light headed, and I can hardly function. I got checked for pre diabetes and I’m in a total normal range, so all I can really think is that I’m legit addicted to food and experience withdrawal when I don’t eat a certain amount. 


I don’t know what to do or who to reach out to since it’s not something openly discussed in seriousness. From what I see people just suggest making healthier decisions, but like I said I become physically ill at that point if I don’t eat a billion calories.

132,"I have PTSD and depression from a really rough, abusive childhood. As a result, I was homeless for about 3 years (17 to 20 - just made 23 this year) and I have a lot of trust issues from that time. People would tell me that I could stay with them for a week, then kick me out the next day. People would offer to send me money (money I didn't even ask for or expect), and then not send it, and stop talking to me for months because they're guilty. I find that so many people never mean what they say, or say what they mean, and it feels like this is just the norm rather than the exception. On television, Reddit, etc. everyone talks about how people who do this are assholes, but I find that most people are guilty of it.

I'm specifically triggered today because my boyfriend and I visit his family every other weekend or so despite the virus outbreak. Things seemed to be fine until I realized how dangerous this was because of his family's habits. Even before the government re-opened here in Georgia (prematurely, most sane residents here agree)  his family was eating out a lot. We have not eaten a bit of fast food ever since the shutdown, because I pointed out to my boyfriend that people who can't afford to work at home , have a customer facing job, and have no PPE are at most risk to getting the virus. I explained to him that someone working at McDonalds in a tiny kitchen with 5 other people and breathing around food with no masks on means we probably shouldn't order out anymore, and that it'd be cheaper to cook all our food anyway. I pointed out how his family still does this, and that when we go over there, we shouldn't eat whatever they order, because they still order out a bunch.

We've had so many talks about how stupid people who are acting like the coronavirus isn't here because the government is open can be. How they're risking their lives and the lives of others. Yet, when we visited his family last weekend, they ordered out for breakfast and he had a chicken sandwich when we agreed that we wouldn't. If he gets it, I live with him, so I get it. I have tons of conversations with him about things, and we explicitly agrees on stuff, and when it comes down to maintaining those agreements, it's always, ""You were serious about that?""

But It's not just him. I feel like most people are like this. Like you can't have honest conversations, or trust, or promises. I'm even told that I'm overbearing for wanting promises. My therapist tells me that I have to ""meet people where they're at"" on this sort of thing, and just ""understand"" that not everyone means what they say, but what's the point of being honest then? What's the point of having any kinds of relationships at all if people don't actually plan on living by what they say they do? What's the point of making new friends and trusting everyone when you think that you're on the same page as someone, and you never are?",12May2020,1
133,"I regret it. As teen and young adult I received many diagnoses.

And was forced to take psychotrophic injections  for many years.

When I was 21 I was brought back home to my parents by police and reported missing on the radio as a ''severely mentally ill and incompetent person'' just because I went to go visit a friend in another city for 5 days. It was a nightmare.

Years later I have not stepped foot into a psychiatrists office and am on no medication but still have a lot of restrictions on me that can never be removed. I am treated like less than a regular person and will never be at status of my pre-diagnosed self.

I feel like I have a tough time speaking up for myself (which I have been working on) and when I do nobody would respect my wishes.  I don't think my needs/wants were unreasonable either. 

For example:  I had a classmate in my study group who was older and more knowledgeable than me put me down whenever I answered something. It was kinda of like he wanted to be the alpha dog.  I had a tough time with that because people like that were the ones who bullied me in the past.  I never really assertive myself the way I wanted to with this person because he I knew he would gaslight me and try to frame as if I was being weird /crazy.    


This example is the first of many which lead me to not trust people (causing even more conflicts).  After all this time (+10 years) i am starting to realize how to connect with people.  I still need help because i am clueless though.

139," As seen in [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/balanced/201907/mental-health-and-dementia).

Dementia is, unfortunately, a very common phenomenon among the elderly. As of [2017](https://www.alzheimers.net/resources/alzheimers-statistics/), there were as many as 44 million individuals worldwide living with dementia. In the United States, as many as one in three seniors has some form of dementia when they pass away.

More than just a mental-health issue, dementia can be extremely taxing on the family and friends of the individuals who are struggling with the condition. It is far more severe than merely telling the same story that everyone has heard before. As the condition progresses, individuals with dementia lose their ability to live independently because they find it too difficult to conduct the activities of daily living — from doing household chores down to feeding, dressing, and grooming themselves — and this can often lead to frustration and aggression. In the later stages of dementia, individuals may not recognize family and may come to seem like completely different people. As they exhibit increasingly dysfunctional behavior, it may even make it too difficult for family members to continue to offer care.

Dementia is not a disease itself, but a series of conditions that can arise when an individual is afflicted with one or more of the over 60 diseases that can cause dementia — most of which are quite rare. In approximately 60 percent of dementia cases, the underlying ailment is Alzheimer’s disease. In approximately 30 percent of cases, it is Lewy body dementia or vascular dementia. Of the remaining 10 percent of dementia cases, the underlying condition could be one of the following: Frontotemporal dementia,[ corticobasal degeneration](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Corticobasal-Degeneration-Information-Page), depression-related dementia, alcohol-related dementia (typically manifesting as Korsakoff’s syndrome), [Creutzfeld-Jacob disease](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Creutzfeldt-Jakob-Disease-Fact-Sheet), Huntington’s disease, normal pressure hydrocephalus, or certain forms of Parkinson’s disease and some related conditions. It is often the case that diseases co-exist, most frequently with Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. When this happens, it is known as mixed dementia.

In most cases, genetics plays a dominant role in determining if an individual will develop dementia, and researchers have been relatively fatalistic about the prognosis of the condition. In other words, there has been a longstanding belief that dementia is inevitable for certain individuals with genetic predispositions, and that environmental factors such as lifestyle and diet do not play a major role in determining the course of the diseases that can give rise to dementia, with the obvious exception of alcohol-related dementia or dementia that arises from head injury, stroke, or a disease like meningitis). This is particularly true with forms of dementia that occur earlier in life, such as frontotemporal disorders or Huntington’s disease.

New research, however, indicates that the environmental components behind some common diseases that give rise to dementia have a greater impact than previously thought. This is true for the three most common diseases that cause dementia: Alzheimer’s disease, [Lewy body dementia](https://www.lbda.org/go/what-lbd-0), and vascular dementia.

**A New Hope**

A new study from the University of Exeter that spanned eight years and analyzed the data of 196,383 adults of European ancestry over age 60 is challenging the belief that one’s genetics solely influence whether one develops dementia. The study found that participants who had both a high genetic risk and an unhealthy lifestyle were three times more likely to develop dementia than those who had a low genetic risk and a healthy lifestyle. This should not come as a tremendous surprise. What was shocking was that the study also found that the risk of dementia was 32 percent lower in participants who had a high genetic risk if they maintained a healthy lifestyle when compared with the group who had a less favorable lifestyle.

This should not be taken to mean that the risk can be entirely eliminated for those with genetic predispositions for dementia. Nor should one assume that diet is as important as genetics when assessing the risk for dementia, as there are numerous causes for dementia with their own pathologies. The aforementioned study that was published on JAMA’s [site](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2738355) earlier this month shows that statistically speaking, the risk of developing dementia can be mitigated to some degree with a healthier lifestyle.

The study’s authors presented their findings at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference 2019 in Los Angeles, where they described the differences between healthy and unhealthy lifestyles. No surprise: The research indicates that smoking; drinking more than a [moderate amount](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/balanced/201907/defining-moderate-drinking) of alcohol; having a diet high in fat, sugar, and salt; and not exercising regularly are all behaviors to avoid.

**Why This Is a Big Deal**

While the Exeter study is not alone in its findings, it is far more comprehensive and concrete than earlier studies. Even a [meta-analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep41317) published in 2017 that found that strict adherence to the Mediterranean diet (which includes physical activity and sharing meals with family and friends that are high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats; less high in fish, poultry, beans, and eggs; moderate in dairy and red wine; and low in red meat and prepared or processed foods) was associated with reduced risk in cognitive decline. The analysis examined nine cohort studies involving only 34,168 participants in total. There were six times that number of participants in the Exeter study. Furthermore, the analysis only examined diet.

Other studies have been deemed less conclusive because of more substantial limitations. For example, a 2017 [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28428346) found a correlation between artificial sweeteners and dementia (as well as stroke). According to the study, “Drinking at least one artificially sweetened beverage daily was associated with almost three times the risk of developing stroke or dementia compared to those who drank artificially sweetened beverages less than once a week.”

As strong as this conclusion may sound, the study suffers from some [weaknesses](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/could-artificial-sweeteners-be-bad-for-your-brain-2017060711849). There are a variety of factors that were never accounted for, and, consequently, could be affecting the study’s results. Perhaps most important of all, it did not look at artificial sweeteners in general — only in soft drinks. Consequently, the study cannot be certain about the amount of artificial sweeteners consumed by any of the study’s participants, as the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/artificial-sweeteners/art-20046936) notes that many processed foods, including some baked goods, candy, puddings, canned foods, jams, jellies, and dairy product, may contain these compounds.

Similarly, not every disease that gives rise to dementia will be affected by improving one’s diet; it remains a condition with a significant genetic component.

However, for the majority of diseases that can cause dementia, it seems that there is now stronger evidence than ever that making lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking, reducing the amount of alcohol one consumes, exercising more, and eating better can have a major impact on the progression of the condition.

There is also overwhelming evidence that these same changes can improve overall mental health, and many physicians have come to recommend them when treating conditions like depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders.

Furthermore, genetic research and testing have shown promise in identifying genes with a strong link to dementia, and research and technology are constantly improving our ability to produce better and more targeted testing that can pinpoint and predict predispositions to dementia at earlier stages in life.

This allows individuals with a higher risk for dementia to learn about the specific risks associated with their genetics and to make modifications to their lifestyle and diet earlier in life, which can affect not only how one feels today, but how one feels later in life.",12May2020,1
140,"i hear all the time: ""there IS hope, depression IS treatable.""  i think it's a very encouraging message and i believe it to be true for most cases.  i think most of the time, if you have depression, you can treat it (even if it doesn't go away, there is at least some relief of symptoms).  well, i've been in intense treatment for 5 years now and i'm in the exact same place i was when i started.  it's not that there's anything external that's stopping me, it's all in my head and i recognize that it happens without triggers.   i've tried tracking when the really bad depressive episodes happen and i can't find any pattern.

i've tried cbt, dbt, tms, acceptance commitment, exposure therapy, lots of meds, groups, hospitals (the best ones in the country), processing, mindfulness, all of that.  still nothing.  i have an open mind to trying new things and i'm always willing to do them outside of therapy, but at the end of the day, nothing helps me long-term.  i'm still not ""treated"" whatsoever.  i have treatment-resistant depression and i've been treated for that specifically but nothing has helped.

so my question is, are all cases of depression possible to treat?  can everyone get at least a little better if they just keep an open mind and try really hard?  i've searched the internet and can't find anything about it.  i asked my therapist and she said ""i'm not a brain expert so you should ask your doctor.""  i asked my doctor and she said ""i don't specialize in mental health so you should ask your therapist.""  i asked during group therapy and one of the guys said (in a very cocky and condescending tone, may i add) that ""you just need to try things and probably the medication just hasn't kicked in.  at first i was skeptical but now that i've actually tried, i'm getting better.""

the thing is, i have tried.  i've tried for 5 years (longer than that, if i can count the years when i was working on my own and not in treatment). i've tried at least 5 meds, each one for at least a month, and none of them helped.  this guy who said it has only been in treatment for like a year and he seemed so proud to say that i wasn't working hard enough.  good for him i guess, but sometimes it's just not that easy.",12May2020,1

It’s like I beyond to upset and hurt people. 

Here’s a few examples of negative things I do: 

1. Create a fake facebook account (using a different name)  and send people that I know horrible messages. Usually insulting their personal appearance and lifestyle. 
2. I’ve sent an anonymous email to a friends wife informing her that her husband has been cheating on her. (This is a true fact) 
3. This tends to happen first thing in the morning - I have terrible negative thoughts about family members and play out having random arguments with them in my head. 
4. I’ve anonymously grassed up my mother in law to benefits team as she’s been cheating the system. 

I understand that these traits are nasty and horrible things to do but it’s like I just can’t help myself. It’s like I want to cause other people misery, and it’s like I almost get a kick out of it. It’s like Im not happy until other people are going through a tough time or misfortune.

I like that they do not always stick with me. If I don't remember them the next morning it still feels as if these realizations are ""unlocked"" now. 

what I would like to know is whether what I am experiencing with weed is genuine or is it just a trick of my high. Does weed have real mental health and accurate self reflecting qualities. If so how should I use them best?

147,"I know that this isn’t a huge deal, especially compared to what other people on this sub go through. But seriously- am I the only one who gets this??? I’d like to not have mild panic attacks whenever I’m in a breakout room with someone, thank you very much.",12May2020,1
148,"Everyone I know is acting completely differently in the quarantine. I know there's obvious reasons for that, all of my friends are also mentally ill and this whole situation is awful. But no one talks normally anymore and everything feels so off and fake. One of my friends in particular has really been bothering me and I don't know how to deal with it anymore. 

I have DID, I've been in therapy for it for almost a year now. I have been sexually, physically and emotionally abused continuously for almost my entire life (18 years, I'm 19 now) and I've only just been allowed to be my own person and live my own life starting at the beginning of this school year, I'm a first year university student and I live on campus. All of my friends are online friends except for my roommate, who has OSDD (very similar to DID, the main difference is that I have amnesia between alters and they don't). 

I'm very close with my online friends. I've always been very close with them, I've never been able to have friends in person before and never had any other options. Two of them in particular live close to me and I have met them a few times before the whole pandemic, I will call them A and B. 

A is the main subject of this story. They're a naturally very kind and understanding person. They have a rough past because they have BPD and have been abusive to many people, but essentially vowed to be a better person before they ended up friends with me and B. They don't really have *abuse* trauma like I do but they've been emotionally neglected by their parents and we've had a lot of in depth discussions about how our trauma effects us. Tbh, I owe it to them that I even realised I was being abused so extensively. They're essentially an empath and they're the most emotionally intelligent person I have ever talked to. They've always been hyperaware of every aspect of their mental health, how they think, and how they act.

B is a bit more rough. They are definitely understanding, but they're definitely closer to being a normie than me or A. They are definitely mentally ill but they've clearly never been in the same severely mentally ill state as A or me. Despite this they do their best to try to understand. Generally, A trusts B less with mental health things than they trust me because I tend to be more gentle with things.

These 2 friends and I have had a group chat together for about 3 years now. I had a huge mental breakdown over the course of 2018-2019 and it ended up in me realising I have alters. I started seeing a therapist as soon as I got to university and was immediately recommended to a specialist for DID, and I've been improving since then. However this mental breakdown was absolutely terrible. From about January of 2019 to July of 2019 it peaked. There were several times that I attempted suicide and A and B had to help me out of it, there was a point when B had to call the police on me, and they were crying the entire time. This was also when my amnesia issues became most apparent, I kept waking up in strange places and at one point during this time I woke up across the country 2 time zones away. All in all it was horrible, I was going through a lot and inadvertently put my friends through hell. It took me about 6 months to figure out and come to terms with the fact that this was from alters, who I have previously noticed when I was 13-14 and at other times, but didn't have the words to describe what they were and eventually forgot about those experiences categorising them as ""normal"". 

Now, I wouldn't say I'm ""okay"" with the fact that I'm a DID system and have alters. I'm what's considered polyfragmented in the DID community, which means I have a countless (over 100+) amount of alters, most not being fully developed alters, and I have complex subsystems and dissociative barriers. It's honestly terrible and I hate having DID. I really wish I could just be normal. But I do think it's healthy to let our alters talk as themselves in discord servers with close friends and such, so I suppose to some extent I give off the impression that I'm ""okay"" with having DID? I'm not sure, but whatever impression I've given off, my friend A seems to have really ran with it.

They've always been really interested in mental health and I never thought much of it. I'm interested in mental health too, who doesn't want to know how their brain works and how it can be fixed? They give me a lot of vibes like they'd want to be a therapist, so I assumed their interest in my disorder was related to that. They ask me tons of questions about how my alters work, how my brain works, etc... And they ask these same questions to my alters as well. 

In the past month person A has realised they are also a system and that they may have OSDD. This started because they messaged me, saying that they've had strange dissociation spells lately, but only very late at night while they're falling asleep, and that they can hear someone else there. I didn't really think much of this, it honestly just sounds like they're half asleep and starting to dream or something. Then they started telling me more things, that a voice in their head woke them up suddenly and that once when they woke up they felt like they weren't themself and that they felt they were a black woman. I told them to talk to my roommate about it because I have DID, they mentioned being fully aware of it so I thought they should get an OSDD perspective on it, I didn't really know what was normal for singlets vs normal for OSDD systems. I wasn't really thinking about it too much, I figured BPD and OSDD symptoms can present similarly so maybe it was something to do with that. It was eventually settled that if they felt like someone else they should try talking to my roommate or me.

The next day they messaged the group chat with B and I that they were a system and had alters, and that they probably have OSDD. This immediately confused me because, *what?* You figured out *and* came to terms with *overnight* that you were a system? It isn't too surprising that they could figure it out overnight, since they talked to my roommate about it; my roommate figured it out fairly easily too, one of their persecutors fronted around me, and they previously discussed how their ""depressive"" episodes worked and it sounded suspiciously like alters to me (they dissociated for the entirety of their ""episodes"" and it was clearly a second voice in their head that they could talk to and argue with), and I bothered to ask the persecutor who they were. But it still took them several weeks to come to terms with it. Ever since then the day A came out as a system, I feel like I've gone absolutely batshit. 

I didn't really say anything or try to think much of it at first, I just thought something was wrong with me for being weirdly irritated by my friend. Every time they introduced a new alter I would be annoyed and I didn't know why. I felt like, on top of being stuck in quarantine, I didn't really know my friend anymore and like my entire world turned upside down. After a couple weeks of this I brought it up with my roommate, and said I felt like something was wrong with me because I couldn't tolerate talking to A anymore. To my surprise, they agreed, and said something was... *off* about their system. After doing some analysing of their texts, I figured out what exactly was off. The way they talk about and treat their system is very, very strange. I don't really know how to explain it, honestly. They treat everything extremely definitely and dramatically, and it's just... uncomfortable? 

That itself isn't a big deal, and that's all it was at first. But as time's gone on, there's been more and more strange things adding up about A's system. It started when they said that their host was splitting, and they gave me this long analysis of what they think is going to happen to their host after they split. Which is weird enough, you don't really know those things usually. It turned out to be exactly right and their host's identity changed exactly to what they expected. After this, they started acting extremely concerning.

My roommate and I have a group chat with A. A sent us a text there, apologising for acting strangely recently (which they haven't been) and saying that something serious happened and they aren't ready to talk about it. I assumed that something had happened to one of their family members or something, as that's the same way they've told me serious things in the past (like when their close relative died and when another one of their relatives was diagnosed with a terminal illness). I was expecting to give them a few days or maybe a week and then they'd talk to me about it. However later that same night they messaged the chat again and said they're ready to talk about it. They gave this long text about how their host alter died and that their entire system, even their evil alter, are in grieving. I had no words. As soon as I saw this I honestly laughed and didn't know what to think. I thought it was a joke at first, but I reread it a few times and realised it wasn't. Alters *cannot die.* I can't stress this enough, there isn't even an equivalent that could be assumed. Alters can go dormant but it's never that much of a big deal, and they were claiming that when the host split they created 2 new alters and are no longer present. I understand that the identity is different, but how can you even claim to someone that they died? This really disturbed me and made me extremely uncomfortable. They continued with this, even after both my roommate and I explained that it isn't possible at all and that the alter is still present, even if their identity is different, and asked me to help hold a funeral for them. I assumed this was some kind of joke and treated it as such and didn't realise until later that they were serious about the funeral thing.

After this everything piled up and I have a very hard time believing them anymore. I talked to B after the alter death incident and to my surprise they were extremely offended on my behalf that A would ever say they're a system. They told me everything they found fishy, which was mostly inconsistencies with what they've said in the past that don't line up with being a system at all-- their symptoms have never matched dissociative disorders whatsoever.

I understand that A is in general a dramatic person and overanalyses everything, so the alter death situation and their thing with alters isn't truly a red flag or that surprising. It also isn't weird to not notice some symptoms until you're really forced to think about them. But I want to bring up that they've been saying a lot of weird things that don't align with the DID/OSDD experience and it's very unsettling to hear from someone. I'll make a list of some things they've said.

""Being a system is fun for me""

""It just feels like escapism to be somebody else""

(After I had a discussion/kind of small argument with them about whether the design of one of their favourite games was good or not and they didn't respond to one of my points) ""X (alter that was out) got stressed and had to switch out so I'm here now, good thing our angry evil alter didn't switch in!""

""My life will be complete and I'll be so happy if I can meet another system at a convention""

""I really hope we split this character"" (about multiple characters, all of which they split)

""I had a flashback and it sucked, on the bright side some deeper alters can front now!"" (Deeper alters are almost always a bad thing??)

""We have no communication at all and I cannot hear any other alters"" (Not really a red flag for DID, but from what I know about OSDD that's... not how it works)

I understand none of these are huge red flags (besides the first two) but they really rub me the wrong way given everything else.

They've asked me for advice on finding a DID specialist (I was recommended to one and I made sure not to even mention alters even though I figured out I had alters beforehand) even though they've only known they've had dissociative symptoms for a month or two max, and they mentioned that their therapist said they didn't seem to have dissociative symptoms so they should ""start looking for another one"". 

They've described dissociation very strangely. Before all this they said they never dissociate, only when they're very tired and falling asleep. They couldn't even understand my descriptions of dissociation. They said they recently realised they dissociate all the time, and that it just feels like looking back, it's hazy to remember and time passed faster. This... is not even close to how I experience it, how my roommate experiences it, how B experiences it (who doesn't even have a dissociative disorder but does dissociate) and how one of my other friends with DID experiences it. Dissociation is different for everyone but when it's that mild I don't think it can even be considered dissociation. 

One of my older alters came out of dormancy and they treated him very strangely, and seemed to take advantage of him not remembering who A or B were, implying that they had full amnesia and had been through his situation before (waking up years in the future). 

For some reason, A completely ignored my roommate and I telling them that alter death isn't a thing and that the ""dead"" alter is still there (the alter that told us *is* the ""dead"" alter!). They told B days later and they told them the exact story they told us, that their alter died and that everyone was grieving. 

They split almost every day and the alters they split are, strange? They only really have fictives (fictional introjects, alters derived from a fictional character), mostly anthros/furries, all of them have the same sexuality. They split about 5 times in the past week, getting 4 furry fictives and 1 furry ""original"" alter, and their reaction to this was ""we split a nonfictive furry this means our brain is set on making furries now"" and it's such a strange reaction to have. I don't know, I feel like this is a weird thing to find suspicious but it just feels off. My roommate and I are both polyfragmented so we both split very easily, and we're both under extreme stress right now, but A is splitting even more than both of us combined and they don't seem to have anything newly stressful going on in their life right now (they've told me this, I asked if something was happening because they were splitting so much)

They also don't have any younger alters and they don't have any trauma holders or persecutors. They have the alter I referred to previously as an evil angry alter, but he's a protector and is only evil to people outside of their system.

They feel the need to explain every time they switch. For example, the quote I mentioned earlier about the evil alter. Or they'll say something like, ""Hi, I switched in because (x reason)"". It's really strange? They also have recently gained a tendency to dump some of their inner monologue on us. Before they realised they were a system, they were working on this passion project for years. After their host ""died"", the alter the host became wrote this long drawn out paragraph about which alter should work on which parts of the project, and treated it like he had to ""carry on their legacy"". 

Something that really bothers me is that B talked to one of A's friends earlier and asked if he noticed that A's been acting differently. He hadn't and was confused why B used A's old name since that alter ""died"". I don't know, I'm really mad that they've told everyone that their host died when the alter is still there. It feels so uncharacteristically attention seeking. 

I feel like I'm going completely insane. I did talk to A last night about how they've been acting weirdly manipulative and they said they didn't notice until I pointed it out, and apologised for hurting us. But I don't even know what to do with the rest of it. I feel like I've completely lost my friend, they're just so different now. Realising you have alters doesn't change how you act this much. I guess it does change interaction at its core a bit, since you have the option to make it known which alter is speaking, but you're still the same person you were before you realise you have a disorder. I don't understand why they're so different now and why they're being like this. I really, really don't want to lose A. They've helped me through so much and they are truly a great person. I feel like such a terrible person for even doubting their experiences, for talking behind their back about how irritating their behaviour's been lately, and for having to vent about this here. But I really, really can't take it anymore and I don't know what to do. They treat being a system like it's fun and it feels like they don't even understand that this is a terrible disorder rooted in trauma and that alters are essentially in a way extensions of PTSD flashbacks. They don't have a single negative symptom of DID and I don't know what to think.

I'm sorry this is so long. There's so many things bothering me about this and I really needed to get it all out.

151,"Mental illness has affected myself and some of the people closest me for longer than I've known what it was and, like many, have often used art to work through it. With photography, I've used Photoshop to [hang out with my child self](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/75pfe2/i_decided_to_try_my_hand_at_photoshopping_myself/) and to make more [abstract composite art](https://conornickerson.com/en/projects/stranger). More recently, I've begun using it [to visualize mental illness/unwellness](https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/aqau4d/long_day_digital_2843x3554px/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). 

For my next project, I'm looking to hear from anyone with a personal story to share about mental illness. The goal of this project will be to challenge myself to create images that evoke what a sufferer experiences, and being someone who doesn't experience every mental health disorder, to be able to create an image that both resonates with someone affected by it and is engaging for someone who isn't. With the responses I receive, my own experiences, and research on each disorder, I'll make a series where each image visually represents one mental health disorder in an artistic and meaningful way.

I believe that hearing about experiences with mental illness first-hand, from a personal perspective (as opposed to just relying on Wikipedia articles and DSM descriptions), will be infinitely insightful and will make for the most honest images.

Feel free to share your experience in the comments or in [this anonymous form](https://forms.gle/PD8ggiaQHt3nzhrQ6). Similes, metaphors, analogies etc. are all welcome to paint a picture of how it feels. No personal details, anecdotes, quotes, or stories will be used for the series. I hope to be able to eventually donate print sales to mental health organizations, so if you have any recommendations on where to donate, I'd love to hear them!

155,"In 2016-2018 When I used to not be okay I used to lean heavily on my friends so much that I brought them down with me. And I didn’t care the way I should’ve. My anxieties were constantly screaming that people don’t think about me and I say I’m fine with that, being invisible, living the simple life but I can’t live like that, if I know something I need to say it, if I am asked what I have been up to I need to pick the most interesting things. I made it about me being a burden and not that I was actively hurting people for my own validation that I make impact on others. I felt so forgettable. 

You’re right,  I was looking for attention. Something for me to be remembered by. I was so certain I wouldn’t make it to my 18th birthday that I didn’t care about the destruction i caused. I was so stuck in a cycle of: caring so much and realising I’ve hurt them I wanted to die and then accepting my eventual death and destroying my relationships even more. Hoping someone would tell me what I was doing was so fucked and to stop so I could have an excuse to take the bullet. But instead, I just stopped.

 I removed myself and I was pushed to grow up. 

I wanted people to like me so much and I cared what people thought about me to the extent that I became a different person put on this earth to please. I sought out drama so I would always have an interesting story to tell. I tried things before everyone else so people would come to me for advice and I did all this to feel needed. 

I hurt people. 

I hated myself. 

And I have not stopped hating who I was back then. 

I’ve tried to push myself so far away from who I was that I’ve rushed growing up and finding who I am. But I do believe I’ve changed, and I’m excited to see where I go. 

For the first time ever I’m excited to see who I become and the life I choose to live. 

This is not a preach saying I’m the best person ever because I’m far from that but I am the best me I have been. 

I still act out on my insecurities and anxieties when something is new or I’m in a panic. And I still haven’t apologised for the pain I’ve caused. 

I’ve been in therapy since I was 8 and I only now know how to ground myself (sometimes) and act like a decent human being but hs put me in a bad place and fucked me up. I wasn’t talking to my therapists because I thought I had it handled and honestly didn’t see the point if I knew I wasn’t going to listen to them and it would be over a some point I really thought I was a lost cause. 

it’s been a year. 

I’m finally talking to my psychologist openly (first time in my life) and just found out I will only have appointments with her until the end of this year (I’ve had numerous Therapists but this one is the only one I have connected with and I’ve been seeing her for several years)

156,"I used to deal with what I thought were intrusive thoughts and that’s what I wrote them off as. But I’ve been having a hard time recently with doing the simplest task like sleeping and talking and reading and paying attention. I’ve realized that my so called intrusive thoughts were almost full trains of thought. I can barley make out what their saying but occasionally a word or sentence comes through loud and clear. When I’m doing good or in a good spot mentally it’s just me in my head or maybe like one other voice but when it gets bad there’s like 8-9 maybe 10 voices speaking in my head. With that many going on trying to make sentences or just even a thought becomes extremely challenging. It made that jump very recently and it escalated very quickly. I couldn’t sleep last night and barley slept the nights before because of them. It’s hard to explain how they sound or feel but my brain feels crowded, it feels like I’m in the security line at an airport the day summer break starts. It feels crammed and crowded with though but it only ever happens for a few hours at a time, this recent and aggressive evolution  of the so called voices in my head is a little frighting.

157,"Today I woke up in a dissociative state. What that means:

“When people are dissociating they disconnect from their surroundings, which can stop the trauma memories and lower fear, anxiety and shame. Dissociation can happen during the trauma or later on when thinking about or being reminded of the trauma. Dissociation commonly goes along with traumatic events and PTSD.”

For a long time, I didn’t know what was happening to me when this occurred, until my therapist explained it (thanks Katie!). 
In my specific case, the symptoms are as follows:

•Depersonalization 
With depersonalisation you might feel ‘cut off’ from yourself and your body, or like you are living in a dream. You may feel emotionally numb to memories and the things happening around you. It may feel like you are watching yourself live.

The experience of depersonalisation can be very difficult to put into words. You might say things like ‘I feel like I don’t exist anymore’ or ‘It’s as if I’m watching my life from behind glass’.

•Derealisation
If you have derealisation you might feel cut off from the world around you. You might feel that things around you don’t feel real. Or they might seem foggy or lifeless.

If you’re reading this, and you feel like this has ever happened to you, this message is for you:

You’re not alone ❤️
It is a strange experience, and scary/confusing after the fact if you’re not familiar with what it is, and that’s okay. 
Before I knew what it was and my therapist explaining how common of a symptom it was for people with depression, I felt extremely isolated and misunderstood. 

Sometimes, knowing you’re not the only one can make all the difference. 

So, if you want to talk, let’s talk! In the meantime, here are some coping strategies therapists recommend when in this state:

•Sensory input to reground yourself with your reality and surroundings 
-Examples: Activating the senses (touch/taste/smell/hearing/sight)

That could look like:
•Lighting candles/incense 
•Taking an aromatic bath
•Massage 
•Playing music
•Engaging in physical activity 

This experience isn’t easy, and it definitely feels strange, but you’ll get through it. And always remember:

You’re worth it ❤️

159,"I realised my purpose, and I'm praying that this too blesses you today: 

*1) God created us for his glory.* 

“Bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the end of the earth, everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory” ([Isaiah 43:6–7](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Isa%2043.6%E2%80%937)). God made all of us in his own image so that we would image forth, or reflect, his character and moral beauty. 

*2)* *Therefore* *every human should live for God’s glory.* 

“Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God” ([1 Corinthians 10:31](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20Cor%2010.31)). The way to live for the glory of God is to love him ([Matthew 22:37](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matt%2022.37)), trust him ([Romans 4:20](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%204.20)), be thankful to him ([Psalm 50:23](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ps%2050.23)), obey him ([Matthew 5:16](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matt%205.16)), and treasure him above all things ([Philippians 3:8](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Phil%203.8); [Matthew 10:37](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matt%2010.37)). When we do these things we image forth God’s glory. 

*3) Nevertheless, we have all sinned and fallen short of God’s glory.* 

“All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” ([Romans 3:23](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%203.23)). “Although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him . . . and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images” ([Romans 1:21–23](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%201.21%E2%80%9323)). None of us has loved or trusted or thanked or obeyed or treasured God as we ought. 

*4)* *Therefore* *we all deserve eternal punishment.* 

“The wages of sin is (eternal) death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” ([Romans 6:23](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%206.23)).

It makes me scared about what kind of person I am because people say that when you are drunk you are the same as normal just with lower inhibitions. But I do things that I would never even think about and its like there is a demon inside and not me. Last night we had a massive fight that I barely remember and he is saying that he is leaving me. I am feeling really suicidal. I would not actually do it but the intrusive thoughts are really bad. I have OCD. I have been cutting myself this morning because it makes me feel like I am rightfully taking my anger out in myself. I said I am going to stop and he says that I always say that and its just a lie. I know that it is a cycle and I do fuck up often, but I just wish he would hold me and say that he has faith in me to get sober. I understand he is angry but I wish someone would give me encouragement because I am tired of hearing him tell me that I will just do this again and my promises are empty. I don’t know what to do.

i have a tendency to not keep in touch with people whom i don’t have mutual settings with. that’s because i have a hard time staying in touch via the phone.

during quarantine, i’ve pretty much stopped seeing all my friends in real life, so after a while i just lost contact with them (totally my fault though - it was me who declined all the phone calls i was getting and barely answered texts).

during that time, a bunch of friends of mine met these other people whom they later formed a new friend group with. now that meeting friends is allowed in my country, that new friend group have been hanging out pretty often, but i have been left out of it. 

how can i re-contact my friends, and maybe even get to know those other people they’ve met?",12May2020,1
163,"For a long time, I would get flashes of a distant memory where I'm underwater. I'm struggling keep my head above the surface, but I keep on being being pulled under by my own exhaustion. Looking up I just see piercing eyes looking down at me. Their gaze is distorted by the light breaking through the waves. One day I talked with a family member about it and they filled in some of the details.

when I was about 5 or so, we were invited to a barbecue at a friend's house. There were a few different families, mostly adults,  but there was another kid who was a few years older than me. Wanting some time to themselves, the adults ushered us into the backyard to play. 

There was a large pool and I remember the boy asking me if I knew how to swim. Being a naive child, I told him ""no"" . A while later I just remember being pushed into the deepest end . I screamed for help but water filled my lungs. He just watched me in a cold dead stare. The fucker just stood there emotionless. One of the adults heard me screaming and pulled me out of the water. I dont remember anything else from that day, but apparently we went home soon after.  The boy's mom brushed it off as ""oh boys will be boys."" Fuck that!  This little shit-stain of a human almost killed me.

Someone might say that he was just playing and being a kid, but I knew this boy after this event. He would frequently hit his own mom, bully other children, and be as much of creep as I thought.

My mother abused me as a child, my father never cared and occasionally found it funny, my older brother also always hit and belittled me, and my sister tries her best but it doesn't do much to reduce the amount of hatred in the house. 

I'm a leftist and a lesbian and they are deeply homophobic, racist, and conservative, often saying disgusting things about all minorities. Also we're slavic so they refuse to acknowledge the mental health issues I've had since childhood (OCD and anorexia). Even when I tried to kill myself last year and was in hospital for a week they reacted only with anger and no compassion. They don't even know that I was raped last year and have bad trauma from it because I know their reaction will only make things worse. 

I'm a very social person and rely on my friends a lot, but I'm becoming so defeated by the darkness in this house that I don't even want to text them anymore. I'm in the UK and it's not clear when the lockdown will be lifted. I'm becoming more and more hopeless and suicidal and am really struggling to be positive when I'm constantly around people who are filled with hatred.

I asked my dad to order a pen for my mom because she wanted mine, and when my mom said she was joking, and didn't really need the pen, I broke down crying, and I think its because I felt so guilty for spending the £15-ish that the pen cost, I guess I felt like it was a huge waste.

172,"I grew up in a physically/mentally abusive and toxic family situation. About 8 years ago I was forced out of the family and the family business where I derived \~80% of my income. I have managed to create a different career and move ahead. I for sure am in a better place then I was. 

These last few years though the fear/anxiety/depression have been building. To the point that this winter every loud noise or unexpected touch made me physically jump. Like someone was behind the door and scared me constantly. 

In around January I started research behavioral therapists in my area under my insurance plan. It took probably 2-3 weeks to get a referral and accepted as a new patient to one of the major hospitals in the area. My first appointment was scheduled for the third week in March. Two days before my appointment the office called to notify me that with the Covid-19 lock down they would have to reschedule me for a video meeting or voice call. The would call latter to arrange the appointment. They never did after several weeks I called them, where they told me they where not doing new patients at this time. However they would call me later when things where reopening. They never did call, again I called them. They told me about 2 weeks ago they expected to reopen soon, and they would then call. Again no call's so far. 

I don't know what else todo. I don't want to get on another waiting list for 3 months. Life obviously has not gotten any less scary these days. I seem to get more tired and wore down almost daily.

Recently, my best friend and my only main source of support passed away. A few months later (about three weeks ago), another friend passed away.

With everything going on, as well as grief, I've had suicidal ideation and a plan but no intention (which my T knows about). Things have just been so overwhelming to the point where I felt like I was drowning and went as far as going to the store to look into buying a gun to end it (I would NEVER hurt anyone else). I ended up going to a gun range instead to try out some guns as I had never fired one before. 

Here's where the story takes a turn. After I began to take the time to shoot with a rented gun, I felt like I was releasing a lot of my stress and frustrations, and I no longer wanted to do anything to myself. I can't even begin to tell you how happy I felt after this emotional release, and I'm still feeling great today. Truthfully, while I was close to buying a gun and then actually fired one for the first time, I realized that I didn't want to die. I only wanted relief, and it actually made me feel safe as I have been living in non-stop fear after being raped two years ago. I have a very good relationship with my T and was wondering if this is something I should tell her about during my next session?

179,"The problem in this current moment is that I can't do simple and necessary things anymore, because I can't control my behavior. For example, meditation is very possibly a solution to how I feel, but I can't initiate anything related to it, so it's not the solution to self-control issues.

Here's the basic timeline. When I was 16, I suddenly noticed a severe depressive feeling, which caused my mind to develop brain fog, which also resulted in racing, uncontrollable thoughts, which developed into an even more hellish condition with obsessive, controlling behaviors and irritability, etc. When I was 19, a psychiatrist put me on an anti-psychotic, because I'd developed muscle tension and severe pain due to it, which was related to fear and health anxiety (anxiety makes your muscles tense in the first place). Other things happened, but I'll skip those. Now, I'm 24, and I started doing samatha meditation, which suddenly eliminated my depression, anxiety, irritability, brain fog, etc. I became highly energetic, outgoing, and I just generally had a lot of zest for life. But then I noticed more frequently there was an invisible fog hovering over me, and I started becoming very sleepy daily. Fast forward, the sleepiness is wearing off, I'm returning to anxiety (strong sensations of pulse), and it's like I can't make any choices. Sticking to a choice is impossible.

TL;DR: I’ve been home from work for 3,5 weeks now from being burned out (or at least that’s what I think it is). I’m mostly looking for people’s advice on how they overcame this 

For the past years i’ve been working as a customer service manager at a big software company. My team is spread over 3 time zones, and is about 20 people big. I was promoted to this role in December 2017, and even though I was super grateful that my superiors thought I could pull this off, I felt the opposite. I’ve suffered from severe fear of failure for a big part of my life (which goes hand in hand with panic attacks sometimes). Starting this role I was struggling from this fear. I didn’t feel like I was living up to the expectations (even though my Manager always told me otherwise) and felt like a fraud at work for most of the time. 

To make up for feeling like this, I started overcompensating in certain areas eg. working longer hours than everyone else, whenever we had a teambuilding event I would skip out on some parts to get some extra work done, whenever the software had a major technical defect, I would come online and help out with crisis communication towards customers, responding to escalations, writing post mortems, etc. I did this at all times - night, weekends. Although our product rocks, technical defects like that occur on an almost bi-weekly basis. I got to a point where I took my laptop with me when I went to see my parents, when I went to festivals, when I went to the movies. Just to be able to jump in when needed. I need to add here that this was not a requirement in my role. We have off-hours support. I just did it to make myself feel useful at some areas at least. 

Outside of those areas where I overcompensated, I felt like shit at work. I dreaded working with certain high demand customers, reading yet another complaint email about something technical defect I didn’t have any control over myself (by that I mean: i’m not a developer, so I can’t fix the stuff customers complain about). I felt like I didn’t know the product as good as people in my team. When I did daily standup meetings with the team, I felt like I couldn’t guide them as good as I wanted to because of that knowledge gap. 

I wouldn’t say I couldn’t handle the workload. Sure, there were times where I felt I didn’t have enough hours in a day. ‘Performance review’ time for instance, when I have to write and conduct evaluations of every team member. Something I find very important and want to do well, so easily spend 2,5 hours per person on (20 people in the team). Those things on top of my regular work were tough. Or having to move over the entire team from one helpdesk software to another one because the former (Desk) was being discontinued in just a few months. Tasks like that did indeed added a lot extra to my plate. But I still don’t think I wasn’t in control of my workload. 

Over the past 2,5 years i’ve been in this role I often found myself driving to work and thinking: “It would be so much easier if I just got into an accident and died. Then I didn’t have to deal with anything anymore.” Other thoughts I’d often had were: “I don’t really have anything which I find worth living for.” These thought have actually gotten better over time, as in I don’t have them that frequently anymore since 2020 (but I can’t put my finger on what changed to be honest). 

There were also times where I broke down. I’ve been home from work in February 2020 for 3 days after having a severe panic attack. I told my manager this honestly. Back in May 2019 I also went through a very low period where I ultimately started crying in front of my manager. There were many times I cried in the bathroom when I got ready in the morning. But each time I picked myself up again and went on. 

Over time I have also picked up the habit of drinking (daily) and doing drugs (only on the weekends) to cope with how I felt. It’s not that I drank that much: maybe 2 glasses/day, and a bit more on the weekend. Mostly I was drinking to either decompress from the stress, or to numb the physical pain I was often having from being stressed (neck pain, locked jaw from clenching my teeth). 

3,5 weeks ago I hit rock bottom, or sort of. It was not how I imagined it. When you hear people talk about burnout you hear stories such as “I passed out at my desk”. My experience was nothing like that. Weeks (months) had gone by where I couldn’t get anything done anymore. And on one Monday morning, after staring at my screen for 3 hours again, I looked at my to do list and could no longer deny that in the past few weeks, I only added tasks to it, but took nothing off. Why? I just couldn’t get anything done anymore because I felt exhausted. So then I asked my Manager/HR for some time off which i’ve spend like this:

Week 1: crying, obsessing about what I should do, not being able to find a solution, crying some more. I noticed I didn’t have any attention span left. I couldn’t read more than 1 page without being distracted. Same with watching TV. 
Week 2: Having to go back to my Manager/HR and telling them i’m not better yet, asking for another 2,5 weeks off. I felt like shit again for having to do this, although they were both super kind and understanding. Right after that I found some peace of mind and decided: “THIS IS THE TIME! I should use this time to focus on myself and do all the projects I ever wanted but didn’t find energy/time for!” I started sewing mouth masks (I always wanted to learn how to sew), started a diet, started working out daily and do yoga daily. My attention span was still shitty. 
Week 3: quit everything because I felt too exhausted. Just did some light exercising here and there. Mostly went back to obsessing over what I should do next. No change in my attention span. 
Week 4: Current week, so far the same as week 3. 

That’s it. Thanks for reading through this already. What i’m mostly looking for right now is:

- Input from people who went through something similar. What’s your story? How did you get better?
- If you didn’t go through this, but have some thoughts, i’m also eager to hear them of course!

I just feel God in my life very strongly today.

I can't really explain the feeling but I felt it earlier when I was struggling with my health earlier today. I felt His gentle hand on me telling me it is all going to be ok.

I also got a shout-out on the other subreddit I follow, and it was very flattering to have been thought of like that. I have the opportunity to not only reach out to someone who is questioning whether they have the same disorder as I have, but to also educate people that this disorder is not anything to laugh about or take lightly. 

Despite my crippling Depression (over moving out of the neighborhood I've been in for 16 years and going to an unfamiliar neighborhood) and my moderate Anxiety (not too bad right now, not gonna lie) I am feeling pretty okay. I am nervous about packing up all the junk we've collected over the past nearly year and a half (I have only been home 4-1/2 full months now) but excited to live somewhere that we have space to move around.

Isn't it wonderful how your Higher Power let's you know that He (She/It/however you visualize yours) is taking care of you?

191,"we have talked him out of his ""sadness"" at least 4 times and he always finds a way to be depressed/sad again. he does not want to delete conversations because of the memories, he thinks his ex was the perfect girl, he continues to listen to lil peep but does not realize that makes him even more sad, he says he would suicide if that means bringing peep back and over-all is hinting at an impending suicide (if that's the right word). I do not have anything with lil peep as an artist, but I can't stand listening to any song in his album ""hellboy"" anymore as that makes me, in a perfectly normal state, sad. We are at least 6 people that tried helping my friend get over and as I said, everytime we think he is getting better he manages to say shit like ""I wanna kms"", ""she was the perfect girl"" etc. It just drives me nuts that he doesn't want to listen to any of the advice we've given him and I'm afraid if we stop giving him advice he might as well just put an end to his bloodline.",12May2020,1

194,"I want to say that this isn’t my problem but its a problem my brother have. After he graduated high school, his tantrums are getting worse and even though he got help from access-vr, I personally think the help wasn’t very effective. Access-vr didn’t tell me what he was diagnosed with specifically besides having a learning disability. He could have Dyscalculia and/or Oral / Written Language Disorder and Specific Reading Comprehension Deficit after looking things up. I have tried talking a general conversation with him, but he does not always talk normally. Sometimes he would yell and hit my mom and I don’t really know what to do then especially when we are both young adults over 18 now. He doesn’t seem to know where the borderline and morality is in things. Also, I know we are in quarantine, but if we returned to a “normal” state, it would be kind to receive help. I just try to really help him so that he knows what to do in the future and not go the wrong paths in life. I am wondering if he can get any actual help somehow from someone with specialty in learning disabilities but can also do therapy at the same time?",12May2020,1
195,"Depression; the cluster of self-critising thoughts that empty out the person from inside like termite does to a wooden plank, the most important aspect we forget is self-worth and believe it or not most of it is connected to the carnal need of human attention so listen to my story you might find it helpful to understand my wordings and what I mean by my words and then we will get to the analysis.

I am a 20 year old man/adult/kid subjected to passive bullying all my childhood and its okay when you cant understand what the other person is doing to you but with my case it was a little different I exactly knew what was happening to my in my young age and I couldnt do anything about, the friends on my street and school all saw me as a failure and someone who was 2 steps below them in every aspect (I was not) although I was narrow minded both socially and financially because the people I was friends with were alot wealthier and more groomed whereas I was raising my own self (kind-of) my father wasnt that much interested in his kids so it was mostly my lovely mother who pampered me.

Enter the early stages of high school/intermediate and this is where I actually started realizing that I was not normal and in alot of depression/anxiety/insecurity, the insecurity was so intense I started stuttering and imposing mental isolation, I had alot trouble getting my message through because I had a hard time finding words for what I wanted to express and to arrange them in that way a person would understand I still do, you can probably tell by now, I also had a problem where I forgot what I was writing and dazed off somewhere else it happens alot it has happened thrice while typing to this point and it requires alot of energy to concetrate back to what you were doing and it drives you crazy like it did to me, I have to read everything 3 to 4 times to actually understand whats written, its like your mind has transformed into a cluster and you have having trouble connecting all the neurons to their right place. (I forgot again what I was writing or more like what I have to write next) the feeling that literally hollows out a person and makes them want to pull their hair out is as they are preparing to write or do something they suddenly forget it and the process has already begun, now this occurence leads to anger and then later regret over that anger is observed and this results in self-hate and self hate evolves into insecurity and that ultimately falls into the category of depression, although it should not.

Depression is the pro-longed effect of accute stress which is fueled by the lack of something you are unable to achieve like deadlines and ptsd and nowadays I see young kids telling everywhere that they have depression, they dont, deep inside they just want something so badly that it results in them being stressed about it.

Another group of people who use depression in its wrong sense are the ones who crave attention (not intentionally) that feeling of wanting something is equal to them wanting attention and again they do stuff that actually results in the defamation of the word 'depression'. Now those people who think depression is caused by attention when they interact with someone who has actual depression because of authentic reasons, they call out the actual depressies as bad people who use a mental condition for their own benefit and this further gives insecurity to the person who has actual depression and he avoids speaking up which leads to anxiety build ups and those burst into self-criticism and self criticism evolves into self-harm and ultimately suicide.

Now this is one way this whole dillemma unfolds there are thousands of scenarios that could lead to the same outcome like financial problems, bad relations, destroyed life and stuff like that (I cant FiNd the flipping words again God, I already have a headache writing all this) 

In my case, everything is clustered up I am partially mad but I know that I am partially mad I cannot control talking to myself or hitting my self and I cant do anything about it, the ironic thing is that I know that I am not providing a viable solution and I am only analysing this stuff because I cant find a solution for my own problem too its too far bad for any mental excercise to work (I am thinking that there is a solution and I only tell myself that there is none and this is fueled by the positivity in my mind) depression is often mistaken for ADHD like I mentioned above and it paints a bad image for actual depression ridden people 

All I can say to fake depressies right now is that the word ""depression"" is a powerful word you have to explore yourself and understand that you are not lost beyond repair and you dont need attention to thrive.

I am jobless rightnow and have a total 3 friends and I was rejected 3 times by universities (things work differently in Pakistan), This part is added in the last and I wanted to discuss a little about narcissism and I almost forgot about it but here we go anyways

People with depression disorders are often offended when a certain phrase is very regularly lobbed at them which is ""grow up, fix yourself"", there is nothing to fix, listening to this phrase often ignites anger and sadness in the depressie's mind and that evolves into negative self evaluation which further over time evolves into ignorance for every aspect of life and this is what converts a lively person to a living dead body. Avoid it, I am referring to normal person, stop telling them to grow up or fix themselves rather than doing so you should step up and help on their feet with their problems (Always remember that you cant fix a fake depressie with attention/brat issues with gentle gestures their depression will only go away when they get what they wanted and was causing them depression, on the other hand helping a real depressie is as simple as giving them a helping hand if they dont have anyone to talk to give them your time and patience and slowly try to pull them back to normal)

Also there is no specific definition for normal everyome has different standards for it sometimes when someone says they are normal it might collide with your idea of normalcy, never judge everyone sees the world through a different eye if you cant see it through theirs, then try to pull them to equilibrium.

It may not be visible in this text but I think I do have ADHD,CAPD, minor PTSD, RLS and few other things they were not diagnosed by doctors its self evaluation

Also the entire analysis is based upon my own self and experiences and I have been through and understand the 3 major players depression, anxiety and insecurity, I am from Pakistan and the hate I recieve online just because I am from Pakistan is over whelming.

If this post gets enough upvotes I'll post a follow up and we will go much further down the rabbit hole and no, attention has a very minor role in my condition and I only wrote this because someone might feel relieved when they place this analysis on themselves and unlike me might be able to become a better version of themselves.",12May2020,1

Many people find that they gain weight as they get older. It seems to be a fact of life for many of us; as we age we put on a few pounds. It's no secret that our metabolism starts to slow down as we age; even as early as age 30. However, there does seem to be a simple secret weapon that can prevent the pounds from creeping on as we get older.

It's no secret that Asian countries have far lower incidences of overweight and obesity than most other parts of the world. And, even as they age, Asians don't seem to put on the age related pounds that plague many cultures. And, of course, it's no secret that Asians drink large amounts of green tea.

And, there seems to be a connection between these two facts. Green tea has been reported to have many health benefits, including preventing disease and weight gain. Green tea consumption has been shown to reduce the risk of many forms of cancer, lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease. Green tea has also been shown to help regulate insulin, which may help prevent or control diabetes.

[CLICK HERE!](https://viveysientestore-hot-skinny-tea.free.builderall.com/)

Other studies have shown that green tea can help with weight loss, as it seems to speed the metabolism and promote fat loss. Green tea seems to have a unique ability to promote thermogenesis, or fat burning.

For these reasons, it seems that being a lifelong green tea drinker may mean that you have less chance of putting on a few pounds each year as you get older. In addition to the abundant anecdotal evidence available by comparing the statistics on obesity in Asian countries to that of European and North American countries, there is also quite a bit of research to back up the theory that drinking green tea regularly over a period of years may lead to lower weight and less body fat.

[WATCH PROMOTIONAL VIDEO HERE!](https://viveysientestore-hot-skinny-tea.free.builderall.com/)

One particularly interesting study on this subject was conducted by the Department of Family Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital in Taiwan. This study looked at over 1200 subjects, both male and female. They compared the tea drinking habits of the participants and evaluated their percentage of body fat and body fat distribution based on waist to hip ratios. Waist to hip ratios are important because we know that fat carried around the hips and waist are more likely to lead to heart disease than fat carried on other places on the body.

[CLICK HERE!](https://viveysientestore-hot-skinny-tea.free.builderall.com/)

The study concluded that tea drinkers were less likely to have an unhealthy percentage of body fat, and were more likely to have positive waist to hip ratios. In fact, those participants who had been tea drinkers for more than 10 years showed an average of 19% less body fat and a waist to hip ratio of 2.1% less than that of non-habitual tea drinkers. But even those participants who had been habitual tea drinkers for just six months showed improved statistics over those participants who were not habitual tea drinkers.

This study denoted several factors that appeared to have either positive or negative effect on a person's body fat percentage and body fat distribution. The factors they rated were as follows:

Smoking - Smoking was associated with higher body fat and higher waist to hip ratio.

Age - Older Age was associated with higher body fat and higher waist to hip ratio.

[WATCH PROMOTIONAL VIDEO HERE!](https://viveysientestore-hot-skinny-tea.free.builderall.com/)

Body Mass Index - Higher body mass index was associated with higher body fat and a higher hip to waist ratio.

Pre/post menopausal - Pre-menopausal women were more likely to have a lower percentage of body fat and a lower waist to hip ratio than post menopausal women.

Habitual Tea Drinking - Habitual tea drinkers had lower waist to hip ratios and lower percentages of body fat.

[CLICK HERE!](https://viveysientestore-hot-skinny-tea.free.builderall.com/)

Physical Exercise - Those who exercised regularly had lower percentages of body fat and lower waist to hip ratios.

So, as you can see, there are several lifestyle factors that affect whether or not your weight creeps up as you age. Of course, age itself is a factor we can't control, as is going through menopause. However, what we can learn from this study is that getting regular exercise, refraining from smoking and drinking tea regularly throughout your life can help you avoid gaining weight as you get older.

Adding green tea to your diet is a simple way to help protect your health and prevent weight gain. As more and more research has revealed green tea's health benefits, it has become easier to find. Today, green tea can be found in loose or bag form for brewing at home and bottled form for those who want convenient chilled green tea. Even those trendy coffee houses now offer a green tea selection on your menu.

And, if you can't get enough of a dose of green tea by drinking it, there are green tea supplements on the market that carry the anti-oxidants of green tea in pill form. But, no matter how you choose to get your dose of green tea, just be sure you get it!

I went to sleep around 5am last night and I first woke up today around 12:30 because my cat was scratching at the door so I let him in. Then I woke up again around 3ish to what I thought was my dad yelling about something. I could hear it clear as day he was yelling about something and throwing stuff around. It woke me up out of a dead sleep and I was a little dizzy and went downstairs and drank some soda and ate something. My dad is home but he’s been on zoom conference calls since 1. He just got off a zoom call and I asked him why he was yelling and he said he wasn’t yelling. I said I woke up to him yelling. He said he hadn’t yelled at all and he’s been on zoom calls since 1. I asked my mom if he was yelling my mom woke up around 2ish and said he’s been upstairs on calls nobody was yelling. What the heck??? What gives? What do you call that?",12May2020,1

I dont know what to do and I'm too scared to talk to anyone about this. I feel embarrassed that I'm failing when no one else in my family had this much trouble throughout highschool.

I dont think anyone in my family has gone to seek help ever for mental health problems.

Hello everyone, I’m looking for advice/help. No negative feedback please. 
Ive been clinically diagnosed with major depressive disorder since I was young. I take 60mg Fluoxetine  and 1mg of Brexpiprazole (Antipsychotic) to help me with my depression. I do not have schizophrenia, I take the Brexpiprazole to help with the fluoxetine. 

So I’ve been smoking marijuana for about a year now, and I’ve never had any problems until now. I’m not sure if marijuana has anything to do with what happened to me but I’m here trying to figure that out. 
The past four times I’ve smoked, I’ve had this overwhelming feeling. I haven’t felt like myself and I didn’t want to blame weed ( because I’ve been a frequent user for quite some time) but was this just a bad trip or is my psychosis out of whack...? 

I’m going to try to describe it the best I can. Sorry if it doesn’t make sense.. so I feel a pressure, like I’m not myself. I’ve had this overwhelming feeling to hurt myself, ( which I’ve never had before ) like something inside me was saying “ hit your head “ or “ hurt yourself, cut yourself “. It’s not like it’s someone else’s voice in my head, it’s mine... but it doesn’t feel like me. It feels like a pressure inside my body saying to do all these awful things and it’s really scared me. I’ve spent the past three days crying, thinking awful thoughts, shaking my head, trying to get this feeling gone. But every time I smoke it seems to be very, very intense. 

At this point I’ve given up weed because I’m terrified of feeling that way. Again I’m not sure if it’s a “ bad trip” or to why I’d feel like this because again I’ve been smoking for a year or so and have never had this feeling. Please help. Thankyou.",12May2020,1

- how’s it like coming off of venlafaxine? i know i’m on a super low dose, but are there any withdrawal effects? 
- i have a super sensitive stomach, venlafaxine was a fairly easy medication to tolerate( i was extremely nauseous the first day but i took gravol and just slept all day and after that day , i had no other side effects ). does prozac have any gnarly side effects?

Kolonpin helped a lot but it wasn’t a medication and had a weird hangover or something. I was taking 30mg of doxepin for sleep but I stopped all that because I moved states and just haven’t got a new doctor. I stopped kolonpin, vyvriid, and doxepin and trazodone about 6 months ago now. I’ve let my mental health get kind of bad recently and I was just curious if I try a new antidepressant will things be different? I’m scared maybe like my brain is too regular or something and that’s why the medication has such extreme side effects for me. And if I tried another one it’ll be like last time I tried getting better and I’ll just feel a whole lot worse. It’s kind of hard to talk about this and I don’t even know what to do anymore since moving away from all the doctors my parents got me.

My schizoaffective disorder gets in the way of my working memory and attention. When someone tells me something its like its in one ear and out the other. It makes it really hard to learn anything at work and I fall behind really quickly.

I dont have very good social skills. I have anxiety when it comes to people and my affect is flat from my schizo. This makes people think I dont like them when really Im just not capable of being as social as they want me to be. Its another way in which I feel like I am falling behind.

The characters talked about that they liked to do the ""cross motion"" (I don't know the right word, it's when you tap your shoulders, forehead and chest like a cross, then kiss your fingers and raise them to sky) because it looked cool and I had to repeat it because it felt very wrong not to do it. I just felt terrible not copying this, it was kind if overwhelming. I am not religious in any way so it doesn't have anything to do with that and had this urge before with other gestures just very very rarely.

(Not good stuff either.) in this situation I don’t want to go and confront him by I think the time is not right.

I spent the first 28 years of my life unmedicated and struggling with bipolar disorder. I finally got to a point where considering suicide was part of my daily life. I finally gave in to medication and, got stable. I took the same meds for about 5 years. I have done therapy and self reflection as well. I still was not getting ahead in life.

After a certain point, there are things I want to do, that being on meds make me ineligible to participate. I figured that my brain has made changes and, I want to try coping naturally. 

It's been about 8 weeks and, the first 6 were easy. I acknowledge that I am willing to go back on my meds if I have too much trouble coping. 

I experienced a triggering event and, I spent the rest of that day struggling with depression and anger. I KNOW the feelings are not rational. I communicated what is going on with my partner. I acknowledge the feelings but, try to move on to other activities. I dislike feeling like I have to struggle with who I am naturally but, I am fighting back, from the perspective of KNOWING that my feelings are not reflective of reality. 

So far, so good... I'm going to keep trying. Sometimes I struggle with discomfort and remove myself from a situation. Worst case scenario, I suck it up and go back on my meds. Why struggle when I don't need to? 

I feel some pious strength will come from facing myself but, maybe I'm deluded...

I've been depressed and had pretty serious anxiety problems for a while, but it has never really affected my performance in school, I've always pushed through it and at least managed OK to good grades. But now, we're at this point where we have to put our all into our school work because we're finishing senior secondary school and ""entering adulthood"", to start working or continuing to universities. And I have totally lost any and all motivation and drive I previously had to keep me going. I've failed some assignments and a test, started but never finished others. It's completely disheartening and often triggers my anxiety, which in turn makes me even more unmotivated, and it just feels like an endless cycle. I do think the transition to online classes has had a part to play because I can tell I really don't feel comfortable studying at home. But I have no idea how to deal with that, seeing as we're not allowed to study at the school. I'm trying my damndest to pass my classes. I just know I can do much better, but I can't even find the motivation to try.
The only thing keeping me from having panic attacks is writing books/comicbooks as well as reading them.

233,"Depression is weird. It’s impossible to describe and some people will tell you to simply shake it off as if you just got the wind knocked out of you and once you catch your breath everything will be better. It’s not anyone’s fault that depression isn’t taken seriously in America or other countries around the globe. Depression is hard. It’s hard to know how or when or why depression starts.  Did my depression start the summer my dad took away sports to teach me a lesson about lying? Maybe.  Did it start when my entire world collapsed in middle school when I found out my mom who had never done drugs or smoked cigarettes or anything bad at all had cancer and still to this day has cancer which has just recently developed into stage 4? Maybe.  Did it start when I felt like I didn’t belong in high school? Maybe.  Did it start when I fractured my skull in an accident? Maybe. Did it start when I let what I thought might be the love of my life go because I was scared of not being enough or having to leave her to go back home to be with my mom? Maybe. Did it start when I consistently and am still to this day always just a couple points away from A’s in my classes leaving me to feel like maybe I’m just not smart enough for medical school?  Maybe. 

The truth is I’m not sure that any of these things were the starting point. It’s just always kind of been right there with me my entire life and thats how it is for most. Happy moments or sad moments.  Like a dickhead imaginary friend sitting on your shoulder always there to remind you that your either too happy right now and you don’t deserve it or you’ll never be happy again.

I think a lot of people think if you claim to be depressed if you aren’t to the point of contemplating suicide that you’re fine. Maybe thats true. Maybe everyone has a little bit of depression, some more than others. I don’t know.  All I know is that it’s truly getting hard. As I grow up and approach the point in my life where big decisions are supposed to be made I find myself not giving a fuck and not in a good way.  Sometimes I wonder if I care about anything or anyone anymore. Life choices seem so meaningless right now and unimportant. I used to want to be a neonatal doctor. Now? I don’t really care what I become. I’ve recently found myself less and less interested in everything. From how my friends are doing to how my grades are doing or stupid shit like legitimately not giving a fuck about what TV show or movie gets put on.  It all just seems pointless. 

But then sometimes it doesn’t. Sometimes life kicks ass. I find that life kicks the most ass in small bits. What I mean by that is I truly feel like the little things are what holds me together and probably a lot of people. Wether its an I love you at the end of a long phone call with my parents or back when hockey was being played whenever the Islanders scored. It’s so weird to me that something as simple as a goal in hockey can give me more happiness than something more serious like doing well in school. 

Idk if this is what depression is like for a lot of people or just me or if this is even depression but its what I constantly think about.  This is what I’m feeling right now. I wish it was easier to describe but I felt I had to get this off of my chest. Depression is weird.

Or I'm just mad at everyone and I'm a jerk with my mother and my boyfriend. It happens that I message him and I want to hurt him so bad, then I feel guilty because I love him so much and he did nothing.

Also I ruin my relationships and hurt people I love. I don't know what to do.

Also, I don't know if it's related but :
– I often have auditory hallucinations, like people talking, and frequent nightmares. My dreams are mixed with reality. I don't think I'm schizophrenic because I'm not paranoid or anything (I guess?).
– I have a lot of social difficulties. You can't see it because I act cool, but people scare me. And I tend to hate most of my class and see only their defaults. But at the same time I want to love everyone, I want everyone to be happy etc.
– I don't talk that much about it because I use to think I'm an average person that don't have any problem and it's all in my head. When I try to explain to someone they don't know how to respond or they don't take it seriously.

238,"Making this post and any others with a throwaway account since these topics are sensitive and political. I thing it is relevant to this sub because, as it says in the title, I believe its having an effect on my mental wellbeing.

And I must state that I'm a young guy who's still figuring alot of crap out, and I just a bit of advice  steady this particular facet of my mental health during this period. I'm not here to debate. And I don't hate any of the groups I'm going to discuss here. I can't stress that enough.

Since I haven't been feeling particularly lonely or bored during lockdown here in the UK. And since my family are still in work, it's been a pretty low key time. I eat, I sleep, I play games, I browse the web, I read. Typical stuff. And I guess I haven't really been as productive as I'd like. Being apart of the GCSE 2020 lot helped a bit, because exams our finished just as schools were closing over here. So I've pretty much no school work.

Most of my time has been on YouTube and Instagram, and Reddit to a lesser extent. 

Combine this with my slant toward politics, and you might begin to get the idea. I'm studying A Level politics at college, starting September. And one of my best mates and I bond alot over political discussion and our views. To surmise; we're both Tories. And the sort of Rule Britannia-ing, God Save the Queen-ing Patriots you might expect Tories to be. We're lovers of England, lovers of the UK and Commonwealth alike. To put it simply. Naturally, I follow quite a few politgram pages, and political YouTube channels. And like to indulge in content surround British and Commonwealth politics on a regular basis.

And becuase of that, a few weeks ago, I found myself heading down a particular rabbit hole. The one regarding mass immigration, demographics, ethnic change, and cultural change. 

Most of the people who broadcast these ideas, particularly in the UK, do it in a real doomer/blackpilled kinda way. Which I guess made it easier to strike the chord it did in my mind, since personally I'm volatile to those kinds of attitudes, and they do a good job of making me pretty nervous in most circumstances.

If you didn't know already, the subject of most of these discussions in Britain mostly surround Muslims. And people originating from countries where Islam is the dominant religion. With advocates from Right-wing groups like the EDL, Britain First, Patriotic Alternative etc. Claiming heavily that demographically, Britain and white-Britons are basically doomed in the future. And that we'll be a minority, Sharia law will become implemented, Christianity fades away. Pretty much saying that the UK and its culture are under immense threat. Due to ethnic change and multiculturalism.

But where do I come into this?

Outside of some political discussion, I hate to hate. I'm a passive, maybe too passive sometimes. I like to be tolerant, inclusive, yada yada. Its just part of my personality and thought process.

But because of listening to all these commentators, watching these videos, reading these posts, and looking and stats on demographics. I've developed this genuine subconscious fear and state of worry. Which I think has been a massive blow to my outlook and mental health.

And in my mind its developed into this twisted superiority complex complex regarding the white-British race. I've found myself obsessing over white birth rates and numbers of observant Christians. In my real life, its manifested itself in me giving people of colour the side-eye. And morally, my demeanor want me to be more obligated to white Christians the any other group. I feel absolutely sick of myself. And becuade of all shit I've seen, all the evidence I see seems to my mind to be irrefutable, and it makes me genuinely more afraid.

I genuinely keep becoming scared that as I grow older  my culture, race and way of life will fall or into obscurity or be destroyed. See how some of those doomer attitudes have rubbed off on me? 

I don't want to look at things this way. It's made me more distant from certain people. Ramped my anxiety way up, the worst it's been since I left school. 

I'm scared, angry, full of nerves and resentment. And what I thought my personality has taken a massive turn. It's the least mentally healthy I've been for a while. And I'm worried about how I might come out the other end.

I just need some advice, people to talk to, people in the same boat, whatever. I'll take any help. I'm just not in the best place atm.

Writing this post has been good though. A big weight feels like its been lifted, if I'm honest.
