1,"hi i think i need help. I never talk about my emotions with anyone, I have everything repressed inside. Also, when I get angry I injure myself. And the thing that worries me the most is that I love it and I enjoy doing physical or psychological harm to others. I play with people's emotions, even my mother's only to hurt them. I have no real friends and I trust absolutely no one. I am very cold, when my grandmother died (I didn't have any more) I did nothing, nor cried. I just went on with my life. Another example is that when I harm people psychologically and they are crying, I enjoy it and I do even more harm to them. I also have to say that I don't love anyone, I don't like loving people, I find it useless.",14Apr2020,0

3,"I have recently noticed that other people have memories from many years ago and I just don't. I feel like everything in the past is not real and I just forget about everything. It's like I have suddenly come into existence and I have been given false memories. Like I know what has happened, but it feels like I never experienced anything and I have someone else's memories. I don't really know why I'm writing this, just wondering if anyone else has felt the same way, because every one of my friends say that its not normal.",14Apr2020,2
4,"Hi! So i'm unsure if this is the correct subreddit for this type thing, but I'mma give it a shot. So Mental Health Awareness month is May here in the US and a couple of months ago I decided I wanted to try and make something about mental health. So I decided to film a couple of friends who suffer from different mental illnesses, and create a video asking them a couple of questions. The goal is to raise awareness about mental health and hear stories about how it affects people day to day. Here is a link to the promo: [https://youtu.be/1LdP3NPxsFI](https://youtu.be/1LdP3NPxsFI)  


If anyone is interested, the full video will be releasing May 1st with follow up videos released throughout the month. The goal there being if you see someone in the video and want to know more about them, everyone interviewed about their mental health has individual videos about their specific stories with it. You can find links to my social media if you'd prefer to follow it there at  [https://tanzi-media.com/](https://tanzi-media.com/)   


The main video is going to be about an hour long, so i know it might not be interesting to everyone, but if anyone is interested in the project/ if it ends up helping anyone then I'm happy.",14Apr2020,0
5,"Hello! I've actually already posted about this, forgotten about it and then I want to talk about it again with reddit, to see if anyone gets it. The trick is, I don't know what it is when I'm not experiencing it. I had this thing a few minutes ago but once I distracted myself it went away. I shall be sitting in bed for example and this feeling comes over me. ""Oh its happening again, what is it, now is the time to try and understand it"". But no, I can't, it's a feeling of distance with the world, mixed with this familiar feeling somewhere I can't pinpoint: not my emotions, not my body, not my mind.... Somewhere... It feels unexplainably ""soft in a gewy sort of way"" and full of an external emotion? A feeling? A spoken word? Yes.... I feel a soft gewy spoken word feeling emotion thing... I always remember while I've having it that I've experienced it for prolonged states when I'm asleep, and that I've had it even when I was a small child. It's always appeared sometimes since I've been small. I just cannot pinpoint where or what it is. It's just something... It usually happens when I am unstimulated. It sometimes reminds me of these demons we all have as children and that send us running to our parent's bed in fear, it just overwhelms me and makes me distract myself by for example picking up my phone. I would really love to know what it is and where it is! I'm not religious or anything but it feels like I feel a sort of external activity interacting with me, or maybe internal, or maybe both? ... I can't describe it and this is when I realise how un advanced we are in science regarding how the mind works. Why this is not simply an emotion or a thought. Does anyone know what I mean?",14Apr2020,1
6,"Me harping over how to improve my life is hurting not only me but the relationships I have with people. I follow countless subreddits just to get tips to get better. Yet, I don’t do anything to change my situation. And honestly I’m not even sure if I know how. It feels the only thing I’ve been was sad and upset. My boyfriend tells me I’ve improved, but I feel he’s only trying to find anything because he loves me, and of course he wants to believe I’m improving. But the truth is.. in a single year, the only thing that I’ve improved was my ability to talk in voice chat. God I’m such a mess.. and I don’t have a therapist to talk about this yet. This is all really hurting me. I just want to get better for everyone, for me, but I can’t.",14Apr2020,2

Mostly thoughts about dying and all the horrible things that could happen. I used to get really upset by it but I’ve learned to not feed into the thoughts as much. 
And yet they still almost constantly fill my head. I’m tired of constantly feeling like I’m having an existential crisis or something.",14Apr2020,2
9,"Hey guys. This will be my first post in this sub. I have this friend. For this purpose, we will call him Scott. 
I worry about him. A bit of a backstory. 

Scott and I became best friends after he started frequenting a store I worked at. Scott and I became inseparable almost immediately. Hanging out constantly, families hanging out together, the works. 
I first noticed something was off when I walked into Scott’s room at his parents house (he was 24 and living at home, no biggie it happens) and all he had was a mattress on the floor and a computer. However his room always smelled so foul. Like body odor, always. 

After I realized his dad is a raging drunk, Scott wanted to know what it was like to live on his own. So he rented a room from me. Since then we have been living together, and I’ve learned a lot about him. 

Scott has no interest in activities that don’t involve computer games. He expresses desire to meet women, but when he starts to speak to one, even in a friendly regard he develops a shyness I’ve never seen, and stares downward at his feet. He is completely reliant on me at this point to give advice, read things for him (he struggles with reading) and most other things. Scott has a good job, but comes home and lives in an absolutely filthy room. He has sheets but sleeps on a vacant mattress, he wears the same clothes to bed that he wore to work, he showers once a week if I’m lucky, and his room is always filled with empty cans, and food, and it’s disgusting. 

Fast forward to quarantine, we’ve been staying inside. Scott’s computer broke, and he had to send it off to get repaired. Scott is just laying in bed, and hasn’t left for a week. Scott will not shower, will only come out to eat, and does nothing but watch anime all day, and complain about how he misses his games. 

I’ve tried really hard to introduce him to girls, how to talk to them (like they’re regular people, hello.)... and he always gets defensive and upset that they don’t respond to him like they do to me. It’s not because I’m overly attractive, I’m average, I just speak to women well, maintain good eye contact, I’m a conversationalist, etc.... I’ve tried several times just to get him to keep his hands out of his pockets, make eye contact and get into the real world.

I constantly worry about him. Every time I suggest he take a break from gaming, and sitting in his room all day or sleeping until 4 in the afternoon, he gets so defensive that he scares me. He is a very good guy, but this has been going on forever. I am afraid to say... I don’t even know what to call this, but I’m out of options and need advice. He’s coming up on 26, and has never even hugged a woman. I know he is shy, but I feel as if something else is amiss. This isn’t me trying to get him into dating, just into people! Any words?",14Apr2020,1
10,"I’m very new to Reddit and this group so please excuse me. Also I’m typing all this on mobile so please excuse any errors. Also this is going to be very long so I hope you have time. 


Lately, I’ve been getting into more arguments with my family, which lead to me crying. I’m very spoilt I will admit but I’m also overly sensitive. The thing is, I’m spoilt with materialistic things. Not once has my family thought about my mental health. They’ve always thought about my physical attributes. “Get skinnier... Be healthier... Exercise... Etc.” I understand they care and I appreciate that. But I have wondered if they even care about my mental health. Let alone even wonder about whether the believe I have mental health issues. 

This started many years ago. I was 10 when things started occurring. I was in Vietnam with my sister, my siblings-in-law and my sister-in-law’s boyfriend. There were 6 of us total. It’s all mostly a blur but I remember having a panic attack. My sister was yelling at me and brothers-in-law were making fun of me. Calling me a crybaby and poking at me. It was like poking a stick at a baby bear. During 5th grade I was having a hard time because I had finished the grade a month early to visit my grandpa. I don’t regret it but I lost so many friends that I can barely keep in touch with. 

So poking fun at a 10 year old who was already having issues with self body image (my family is asian so the standards of beauty were very specific. They specifically wanted me to get skinnier despite me already being thin) and I was cutting at the time. To sum it up my sister declared me misbehaved and called my brother. I got lectured for not following orders (we were packing up to leave the hotel) and I was a crying mess. 

I cut up until end of 6th grade and I stopped. I was clean for 2 years until 8th grade hit. I will call myself out now and I will admit that my story takes place during quarantine. I am currently in 8th grade and my grades are shit. I know that I am young and I don’t have much reason to be cutting myself and being “depressed”. But that’s how it is. Depression just hits you. No matter how good your situation is, you can still get it. 

I am a very big procrastinator and I have trouble focusing on schoolwork. The only way I can explain it is explaining that any time I attempt to do homework during quarantine, I get easily distracted. It’s hard to not get distracted. I have been to the doctors and my last visit ended with my doctor telling my own sister that I have mild depression and anxiety. Apparently those words went to deaf ears. Not once has my sister thought about sending me to therapy. Today my teacher emailed me AND my sister that my assignment for her class was due last Wednesday and I didn’t turn it in. 

Keep in mind I have trouble with focus and I’m basically failing the grade. She told me to tell her what happened. I’m pretty sure she called my uncle to cut my phone sprint data and so now I’m patiently waiting for my life to fully flip upside down. I’ve cried myself to sleep, cried to myself in the shower for weeks now. I’ve also started cutting again a few days ago. I don’t mind if people call me dramatic but I need a place to go to. I don’t trust most of my friends and family, and I don’t want to bother my best friend. Reddit is a place where people don’t typically judge as long as you’re not being a douche so I though I’d come here anonymously. 

This is just a small rant about my mental health slowly affecting my actions and my inability to focus. Along with my family. It’s not really worthy here but I couldn’t think of anywhere else to go. Thanks for reading is you even made it this far. Have a great day or night!",14Apr2020,2
11,"I decided I was going go for a fag on the front of my mums flat and I encountered a seriously deluded man. He was suffering from full blown delusions and couldn’t even remember his name or date of birth and kept forgetting everything few minutes. He didn’t even know where he was.

He asked me odd questions and I could clearly see he was very distressed and not in a good place so I asked him ‘do you want talk about anything’ and this is where it all started. He explained he was being told by this man in his head his cousin was bad and saying twisted things about it him. He explained that he was raped when he was younger and the voices and this certain guy were making things up and making him believe his cousin did things to him and made him say horrible things to his cousin. 

He explains to me that because he felt dirty he stuck a knife up his arse because it didn’t feel clean he also explained he couldn’t watch tv because it was telling him things and that Jesus was after him and he was punishing him for sinning and a machine in his house was stealing his oxygen and making his lungs bad and saying it was effecting his voice. He also said he had thoughts about killing people and himself and he couldn’t think straight and was very distracted by his head. He repeated himself probably 100 times and kept forgetting he spoke to me and asked where he was and repeated all the above what if said.

Anyway I decide I can’t leave this man he’s obviously seriously hurting and very distressed and is a huge risk  for himself and others. He explains he has been rejected multiple times and people have told him go away and he thanks me for listening (not sure how he does remember that but I don’t question mental health it’s a very strange thing and suffer deeply from it my myself). So I decide to ring the access team in the uk and the guy who answered was very unhelpful and was rude tbh. I started to get angry at the man becaUse this guy was seriously in need of help and he was pretty much turning him down because the guy suffering managed to say his name and in the system said he was a previous drug user and is probably under the influence and to ring back tomorrow and hung up. 

I decide to ring the 999 because I couldn’t just leave this man he was in need of serious help and I had wait 2 hours but I just didn’t care because this mans suffering was deeply hurting me and I nearly cried at the stuff because I seriously related. In the 2 hours he jsut kept repeating himself so I kept repeating myself saying I’m not here to harm i am here to help. He was pacing and rocking back and forward he was so distressed it killed me inside this man was going through this (both my parents suffered schizophrenia and I believe I’m starting to develop it myself multiple symptoms). The ambulance turned up and took him to the hospital. 

I’m so angry at the access team they are meent it help and they just turned him down and I’m honestly truly sorry if this has mistakes and everything I’m so stressed. I’ve been on edge all night nevause I thought j could of died but I didn’t want lesve the man because I needed to help him. Mental heath really needs to be understood so much more it’s pure hell.

And I do get some acid like belching but I have been eating big fatty meals this last days with beans and stuff. I’m 25 with no health issues so far. Could it just be anxiety if it is I learned to not freak our from then just drink water. And when I smoke weed or talking about it I don’t feel it at all aswell.

4. I used to have a slight eating disorder. (It never got super serious I just my body in a distorted manner. I also still hav certain physical health effects due to it.) I’ve also been self-harming since I was about 13 or 14. (I do and did have periods of time where I wouldn’t feel the need but I eventually always got stressed and that led to me staring again.)

Alright, now that, that’s out of the way... Hi.
Before you ask, no, I do not have major suicidal thoughts or tendencies. Of course I will have the ordinary existential crisis, but it’s not as bad as it used to be. The reason I want to go to a MH facility is because of my self-harm. It’s gotten way out of control and I hate having to rely on it. I’m afraid to bring this up to my parents because I hate talking about the fact I’m hurting this bad. I also don’t want them spending any more money me, due to this subject. And even though I know my case is really bad to some people, it doesn’t seem that way to me. I feel like if I were to go to the hospital I would just be taking up a bed space that someone else truly needs. 
I just don’t know what to do, but I really need help. I can’t talk to my friends about this because it’s to uncomfortable for me to bring up.",14Apr2020,2

I have been struggling with persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) for about 12 years now (turning 23 soon), but only realized it last year.

Mental health has never been something my family talked about. Parents divorced about 10 years ago, my mother always made me feel worthless, my sister pushed me on that, I had noone to turn to. I was always told to ""suck it up"", so I did. I showed no emotions for the majority of my life.

I've always had major depressive episodes (late realization too) around Christmas, but now, thanks to an ex-colleague who really knew how to cause me pain I'm deeper in it than I've ever been.

I want to die. I'm done with life. It's way too painful for me, I can't take it anymore.

But I have to. Killing myself would cause incredible pain to my grandma, the only person who actually cares about me, and I can't do that.

I've tried different anti-depressants and I'm in therapy, but nothing helps. I've exhausted all of my options to get better, I know I never will.

Hello all,

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

the subbreddit is reddit.com/[r/theredditnation](https://www.reddit.com/r/theredditnation/)

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy (for now I will be the “king”)  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE’s and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

For some reason my parents got stuck with my grandparents thinking this would be a momentary thing. I'm really worried for them as my grandparents are very mentally abusing and the reason i stopped talking to them years ago. For example, as the stay at home order is mandatory the maid hasn't been able to go to my grandparents, so my grandma is using her 60 year old daughter and my mom and 70 year old dad as the maids. Making them clean their house, to cook for them, do the shopping and tend to their needs. And as they're getting more cranky because the curfew has already being on for a month, they're getting more and more abusive with yelling and verbal abuse.

It is really painful to hear them suffering like this everyday. And as I live in another country, there's nothing I can do but hear them and say ""This will pass"". And it's even more painful and It makes me  more angry that the only way they can cope with it, it's to go to the supermarket for a few hours risking their lives.

45,"My name is Bryce and I’ve been a member of Reddit for over a year or so now. I joined Reddit just for communities such as this. I have to say, support like this makes me realize that life isn’t all doom and gloom. My personal hell is nowhere near what others have described theirs to be. But, maybe sharing my personal experience can make people feel not-so-alone. 

I suffer from bipolar 1 and manic-depression with a touch of insomnia. Yes, these are all clinically diagnosed conditions that I actively sought out so that I could find a solution to them. Since age 12, I have gone through a large number of manic episodes that included many days to weeks awake with little to no sleep (without drugs), grand delusions of grandeur or talking even my closest friends ears off. These manic phases were always followed by days/weeks long series of rock bottom depression. These included a lot of suicidal thoughts and even some suicide attempts. 

I’m also pretty sure I suffer from a small amount of ptsd as well. It’s not nearly as alerting as the manic-depressive episodes. But when you throw in the bipolar mood-swings among the lengthy episodes of fore mentioned manic-depression, it can make for a cocktail of almost every emotion there is to feel. I hope that I can serve as proof that anyone can overcome their predicament regardless of it’s severity. 

To sum things up, do yourself a favor and get diagnosed if you suspect you may have a mental condition. This is no joke and neither are mental illnesses. Our system of mental health care is far from perfect but the help is there so long as you are willing to seek it out. I love you all!

46,"Again, trigger warning for self harm. I'm not trying to be gratuitous, but it helps describe context.

Hi, Reddit. I (14f) have been struggling with self harm for a while. It's really gotten worse in the past month and I don't really know how to stop. 

Last year, I cut myself once with a paper clip- I feel like that's really not serious but I still have a scar- and I told myself I would never cut myself again. Then, about a month ago, I thought to myself that I can ""get away with cutting"" if I pretended it was an accident. I don't know what I was thinking. I think I  just wanted to see if I had the ""guts."" Well, I kind of got tunnel vision and decided to try to cut my legs with my razor. I immediately told my mom. 

After that, I think the next day, I decided that I was going to scratch my leg until it bled. I knew it was sort of possible because a couple months ago, I had a really bad itch on my arm that I scratched too much. That was actually an accident. Anyways, I sat down and put on music and scratched myself. It hurt like hell, but I was going to ""keep pushing myself until it got deep enough."" Afterwards, it felt kind of surreal. I didn't know why I did it, and I didn't really believe that it was possible. I immediately clipped my nails- I used my nails- and went to my mom.

Same thing happened on Friday night. This time, I got into a *super* minor argument with my mom and I feel like I started spiraling. I went to my room and scratched my arm. My nails had grown out long enough for it to ""work."" This time, it wasn't out of curiosity. I *really* hated myself that night and I cried some while I scratched myself. Afterwards, still crying, I called my best friend. She always makes me feel better and after I hung up, I went to see my mom again. 

Today I had a meeting with my therapist (over Facetime) and we tried to figure out coping strategies. None of them that she suggested would work, though because once I start thinking about cutting, I can't stop. It's pretty rare, but it's been getting more and more frequent. I'm honestly kind of scared. I need a way to stop myself before I start spiraling, but I can't figure anything out. 

If you can, I would really appreciate some advice. If not, thanks for reading my post. Stay safe everyone.",14Apr2020,0

Like I'm always standing on the edge of a cliff (not literally) and I want to jump down but for whatever reason, I cannot.  I really want to cut myself right now but I'm also trying to stop but if I don't I just feel worse. I cannot do this anymore... literally all I want to do is scream and stab myself.

She uses it so she can post 'quirky' or 'relatable' things on the status. And to be quite blatant the only reason she has been doing it is to try get attention from her ex again.

I've spoken to her parents about whether she had ever shown any signs or if she's ever been diagnosed and they gave out a flat no. She has a concentration disorder, which isn't even to the extent of ADD or ADHD. 

I really want to talk to her about this because she also often messages me and is like
Life sucks or life is sad, and then when I ask why she is just like 'just'.

Its really frustrating as I have bipolar disorder and actually deal with clinical depression during depressive episodes. The way she acts about it I honestly feel is part of the reason serious cases get shunned and not taken seriously.

72,"Note: I do frequently speak to a professional about my mental health, but it has become quite hard because of the whole virus thing. Tele-health makes me very uncomfortable because of the great lack of privacy in my home, but I will definitely be consulting a professional soon. I’m not looking to this as a replacement for professional help, but I am in great need of answers. 

For the past two to three months, I’ve been on edge. Everything is loud, but only to me. It feels similar to when I have panic attacks. (I’m referring to loud not really as sound, but just too much. A really pungent smell could give me the same reaction as my mother yelling at me) Almost anything sets me off: sniffing, chewing, talking. I’ll give a few more in-depth examples:

1. This is a less extreme anecdote where my reaction feels more appropriate - A few days ago, I was at the dinner table with my family. It feels like everyone in my household tries to smack their lips and gulp really loud at the dinner table, and I couldn’t help but tear up and physically cringe as a reaction.  Later that dinner, my sister and I were having a casual conversation, but to others it may sound like bickering. My mother slams her hands on the table repeatedly, almost knocking many things over, saying that she is sick of our constant arguing. I immediately go silent, feel nauseous, lose my appetite, and clean up my plate to sit in my bedroom. I sit on my floor and cover my ears, trying to block out the sound. 

2. My younger brother isn’t very old, so he likes to dance around and incoherently sing along with songs. I do not like either of those. His dancing and my sister’s constant tiktok dances put me over edge all the time. I don’t know why, but just looking at them flailing around makes me so angry. The singing doesn’t help either because of the aforementioned problem with everything being “loud.”

3. Someone in my household overcooked one of those mug cake things, and it smelled horrid. The smell engulfed the entire house, so I, once again, fled to my bedroom to escape the smell, but it had permeated into there too. I couldn’t help but cry and bury my face as hard as I could into my blankets to try to block out the smell. 

The only thing I can conclude is that a lot of sounds, smells, and actions have been setting me off for no reason. Had I experienced any of the three anecdotes above six months ago, I would have brushed it off and it would be no big deal.

77,"Reddit has helped me get some answers so I'm just trying to get lucky again.

A few months ago I posted here and in r/anxiety. The thing is that I had just started taking Lexapro and while continuing with Lurasidone (idk if it's a common atypical antipsychotic). The doctor had prescribed it to me after I had raised concerns with my anxiety. I was unsure of how it'd affect me considering the stigma and all. 

Everything was going well and good. I was starting to feel better, even making fun conversations with colleagues. 

*enter cute and coo girl*

We were going good as friends. Well not that much, considering my condition. Nevertheless, she kinda played a part in opening me up, feeling stuff, after a long time. Sure, things were pretty plastic. But it was good. 

Then some things happened, my tactile hallucinations started acting up and the whole accompanying delusions started coming. I've recently googled and found out about 'delusion of reference' and I was exactly that, a definition of it, in my psychotic phase 2-3 years ago. It basically means that you assign meaning to everything. Like, a bell would ring, a bulb would flicker, and you would assign meaning to it, like it's a sign. I even applied it to my tactile hallucinations. All these conflicting ""signs"" and ""meaning"" really cooked me up good.

So thinking of that, I spoke with my doctor about a month or two ago and asked about taking abilify in the morning (since lurasidone makes me very drowsy I only take it at night). He prescribed it to me saying he was thinking the same thing. 

Coming back to now, the tactile hallucinations remain and the delusion if reference too came with it, though in not that much of an explicit way (I can still compose myself and fught against it). 

The girl. Oh the girl. I've been on a roller coaster ride of emotions. Since the lock down started, I don't go to work and work from home. I've been very productive, painting, sketching, writing, playing music. And now this girl, she got me going aaaahhhh... It's the literal going crazy in love (read attachment) thing that's happening to me. I've been having so many mood swings since a couple of days ago. I'll get moody then ecstatic and I can't even talk to my doctor right now because of the lock down. I took abilify also for the reason that the guy/gal in r/anxiety, who recommended it to me, talked about it helping with the negative emotions. I feel like it worked too well and now I'm going crazy emotionally. 

Did I mention my tactile hallucinations telling me about things to do or not do every single time I'm making a decision?",14Apr2020,2

79,"Hi, I’m a college student who has posted on this subreddit before. Since COVID-19 forced all our classes online, I’ve been wanting to post on here again to reach out for some assistance, since things have got somewhat worse since my last post and most of the responses were about the financial side of that.

These last couple of years have been bad, but last year was probably the worst. Wednesday (4/15) will be the one year anniversary of my mother’s death. After she passed away, I found out that my mentor was being forced out and all of my friends/co-workers were graduating. In the fall, I returned to find that I lost my job, so I had to find a new job.

Perhaps the biggest thing to happen was I lost interest in my major. I’m studying journalism, and before everything happened I was super passionate about it, even though I could tell something was wrong. During the summer, things got worse. When I returned, I was burned out on journalism.

My fall semester went much better than I anticipated. It was the best semester of my college experience, academically. I worked hard to raise my GPA. At the end of the semester, I settled on wanting to pursue a career in web design.

This semester, on the other hand, has been a train wreck - even before COVID-19 hit.

I’m not sure what I want to do. I know I don’t want to do journalism, and I’m not so sure I could be successful in web design since I only know HTML/CSS and have tried to teach myself PHP and other, more sophisticated languages but failed. (This semester I haven’t even had the time or energy to practice.) For one of my career readiness classes I’ve taken some quizzes but I still have a question mark for what I want to do.

The other problem plaguing me this semester is exhaustion. I’m constantly exhausted... and it doesn’t matter how much sleep I get. I feel my memory, attention and cognitive skills have declined, as well. I don’t feel as “sharp” as I used to be, and I’m very forgetful. Even things I used to enjoy doing or would do for fun (such as working on websites, etc.) have fallen by the wayside because I don’t feel like I have the energy to do them.

Another issue is my self-esteem. I have very little self-esteem. I feel like I’m not good at *anything.* I’m constantly worried that I’ll end up working at a McDonalds flipping burgers for the rest of my life, living with my family. (I can’t work fast food or retail... it’s just not for me.) I’m worried that I’ll never grow or become truly independent, and that worries me.

Right now I’m in the middle of trying to find an internship for my degree, but I’m not even sure if I could handle an internship with my current mental state. I don’t even know what I want to do (except I know what I *don’t* want to do), and I constantly feel exhausted which has caused my memory and cognitive skills to suffer. I have no self-esteem and I’m constantly worried I’ll be working as a burger flipper or cashier for the rest of my life and I’ll never be truly independent or happy.

Really, I feel like I’ll never crawl out of this hole and be happy again.

COVID-19 has really exacerbated things. I was furloughed/lost both of my jobs and have to do all of my classes online. I’m now even more stressed about finding an internship or job that will work.

What are some things I can do to get back on track? What are some things I can do to gain energy and improve my self-esteem?

Because of my current financial situation and having no health insurance my current options are limited. I can’t get any medication (before loosing my insurance I was on a SSRI.) I’m currently talking with a free counselor provided through my university (grad student) but I’m looking for something more permanent, since she leaves in May and I feel her advice isn’t too helpful. I’m currently trying to get on a sliding pay scale with a local clinic. Getting health insurance isn’t an option since the cheapest private option costs almost as much as I make each month, and I’ve looked into government healthcare (Medicaid/Medicare) but I don’t even have a chance as my state (MO) has very strict requirements for Medicaid recipients. I’ve also been trying to get some exercise and taking some time for myself to do stuff I enjoy, but these really haven’t been too helpful for my mental health.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, and I apologize for the long post.",14Apr2020,2

She had a traumatic decade long relationship with a narcissist who emotionally abused her, and she complains and moans about him still even though they broke up 5 years ago. I do sympathise, but she is in a much better relationship now.  She also bitches about old friends, and I often ask why was she was friends with them then?

When she goes off into her tirades, I slowly but eventually mentally switch off. I don't even answer back and I start looking at other things. I don't mean to, but the wave of negatively and pessimism seeps into me, and I have my own mental health issues I'm trying to cope with. I feel like an exhausted, broken shell of a person after a conversation. The only time she doesn't go into a diatribe is when she is focused on a task, but then she is barely responsive to me socially due to her intense concentration.

I would just like a nice, average conversation about pleasant things, such as sunny weather, easter chocolate or something objective, but she doesn't seem interested.

I got diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder at 19 and got prescriped Seroquel (Quetiapine.)

What the hell. After the first appointment? I know it's a paid clinic. I just can't believe it. I think my doc is really just taking the phrases ""feeling like being watched in public"" out of the context to apply this kind of diagnosis. I've been severely depressed and suicidal, so I reached out to a clinic... and got diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. I don't get hallucinations sober at all, or after sleep deprivation.

That's the confusing part because sometimes I don't know when I'm going to hurt someone or already hurting them. Which is another dilemma because since I don't know these things,  maybe they're right, maybe it's just my defense mechanism telling me I didn't want to hurt them and I never intended to, thus maybe I really am bad person. At this point it becomes really confusing, I can't tell who I am anymore. Am I really bad like they think I am or am I someone different.

121,"I don’t know what’s wrong and I would like some help. Growing up I would get in trouble (like any child would) but I would start clamming up and not be able to say a word to my mom even though my thoughts were racing in my mind knowing how to respond. Due to the lack of response, this would further increase punishments and make me endure more than I would need to if I could have just said anything. This kept going on as I grew older and recently I slipped up and my mom found out I wasn’t quite happy for the past couple of years. She tried questioning me and I couldn’t answer even though I knew what to say but it would make my mom even angrier and try other methods to make me say something. She isn’t a bad mom she really does love me but she gets frustrated easily when she doesn’t know how to help because I stop speaking for some reason. I’m not mute at all but I would start fidgeting and panicking if I was in trouble and was being questioned by my parents because I stop speaking to them.

122,"As a bit of a background: I have a loving family. Sure they have their flaws (my grandma and sister especially) however they are a loving family who only want the best for me. Despite this, I'm not able to talk to them about stuff like this.

Now into the meat and potatoes about this post. I'm having very dark thoughts about many different things. The most recent, which happened just a few minutes ago, is grabbing a kitchen knife and jabbing it into my grandfather's throat while he's sleeping, watching him struggle and bleed out. This thought scares me heavily, and thankfully I'm trying to keep myself calm and collected involving this.

Other thoughts include things like suicide, cutting, etc. This has been going on for a while but ever since the quarantine stuff has been going on, it's been stressing me out to no end and getting worse. At this point in time I'm also struggling with my online schooling, constantly getting distracted before I even get started on work (I'm VERY easily distracted. Keys jingling in my face easily distracted). I'm not sure what to do and it's very tough to even think of bringing it up with my grandparents.",14Apr2020,1

124,"I’m a high school senior. I’ve had an issue since 7th grade where I either switch schools or have my grades drop in the second semester. I work very hard in the fall, but in the spring it’s almost as if I used up all of my energy. I have such little stamina, and it happens even if I don’t work hard in the first semester of the year. Second semester is always a shitshow, and it makes me scared. I want to pursue science or nursing in college. I’ve done some college classes before, and I’ve done really well on them (first semester of course, the next semester was terrible and ended up with me switching schools again). I’m just so scared that if I enter nursing, I won’t be able to retake a class if I do badly on it because it’ll impact my admissions score. And then my dream will be gone forever. 

I have considered this to be a form of SAD, but it hasn’t responded to antidepressants. It clears up in the summer toward the end of the semester (I’m back to normal again as of rn). I’ve been on meds for 1.5 years now and all I’ve had happen is severe, severe weight gain (150 lbs). And this weight is making me feel even worse! I know I can lose it, but I’ve lost weight before, and it’s so unmotivating to lose 60 lbs then gain 150. 

I have no idea what to do. Therapy hasn’t helped, a relationship hasn’t helped, meds haven’t helped. I feel like I’m just so stuck because I KNOW I can do the actual work, but my stamina is so bad that I don’t know if I can keep up with the work.",14Apr2020,2
125," In our society, the norm is that a marriage is a holy tie between two individuals and that nothing or no one can bring about any uneasiness between a couple. However, for people in the real world and not the one created due to delusion, there are plenty of cases where marriages have ended, or have at least endured a huge patchy phase. Due to these unrealistic expectations from companionship, the idea of [marriage counseling](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/family-therapy/) is also considered a taboo in most parts of our country. However, in recent years, just like the conversation around mental health has picked up, the idea of marriages facing issues has also come under the limelight. Today’s urban lifestyle, work pressure, peer pressure, the compulsive need to look perfect on social media have all led to issues in a marriage. Sometimes, just one of these reasons is enough to trigger a series of unfortunate events. So, how do you recognised that your marriage needs a lot more than just another baby to go back to normal? Also, spoiler alert, if you and your partner having troubles, a baby most definitely will not solve any of them. 

One of the most common signs of a rocky patch is that conversations no longer happen between you two. If it is tough to either start or continue to a conversation, then you might have reached a saturation point in your marriage. That does not necessarily mean that you need to get divorced. It essentially means that you need to work on your relationship, and that feeling of “organic love and conversations” will have to be re-instilled. This is where a [relationship advisor](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/couples-therapy/) can come into play. Different kinds of exercises in therapy can help ignite that feeling of affection and love which can get lost. Marriage counseling can also help put things into perspective. When you have been living with the problems for so long, you lose the ability the look at a problem in isolation and it becomes a chain of events wherein you start fighting about one thing but end up continuing that fight about something completely else. 

Another telltale sign of trouble in paradise is the lack of affection you feel. Due to the continuing problems and fights, you end up having a tunnel vision about the relationship. This results in both the people in a relationship losing sight of what is important and the core reason why they decided to get married. A [counseling psychologist](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/) here can help the couple redefine their relationship and moreover, help them rediscover the reason they fell in love with each other. Sometimes, just reliving old memories and finding reasons of their union can help eradicate most of the issues they currently face. This becomes possible because a relationship advisor becomes a level of objectivity to the dynamic. Hence, if you feel like your marriage is not the same anymore, but you still want to make it work with the person you once decided to spend the rest of your life with, find a good therapist and start working on fixing your problems.",14Apr2020,1
126,"Under typical circumstances where we're not going under a pandemic I'd say she's pretty nice. Perhaps a bit on the awkward side. We have had very minor situations in the past where she is so super excited to tell me about something and I am emotionally exhausted and feel like the bad guy telling her I am not ready to hear it at the time. I try to make sure I return to her later and say so what did you want to tell me about. We'll call her roommate A.

Anyway a situation came up where there was a topic she brought up to me that I wasn't aware was going to trigger me hardcore.... I'm not going into details here but if you're at all curious what it was you can message me and I'll tell you. I started to cry I apologized for crying because I didn't want to give her the impression I wasn't trying to listen but I was on maybe day 5 of practically no sleep so my ability to handle hearing something that was a trigger was not good. She said she was sorry that it was a trigger and I decided maybe the two of us would just give each other some space for a bit so I could process it and kind of cool off.

She sends a text late at night about a house meeting and I knew it was going to be the same topic. We do have one other roommate, I'll call her roommate B. I tried texting her that I needed to tell her something but she didn't respond and she also had a do not disturb sign up on her door. I respond with a time that I think should work for me. I was having a hard time making a decision with my exhausted brain but I thought maybe if I just sit through it it'll be over soon.

So the next day comes and I didn't sleep again. I tried to catch her before ""the meeting"" and let her know I wasn't sure about my ability to discuss this with everyone in the room and she just coldly said that it involves the whole house. So she brings it up and she does a lot of ""haha I'm not trying to be intimidating but...""

And she's basically asking us to make life decisions for her. Roommate B said she didn't care do what you want to do. so then Roommate A proceeded to say well what do you guys think about XY and z and I finally realized I was on the verge of crying in front of both of them so I said can you just text me later I'm actually not doing well and  said well I need you to stay here for 2 more minutes.

So then after a few minutes of her going on I said could you and I talk 1 on 1? The Roommate B left the room and Roommate A was annoyed with me for ""disrupting the house meeting"" which more or less was over because the other girl said do whatever you want to do. 

I told her this topic was triggering and that she knew it was. She ran it by me the day before and saw what happened. I told her I tried to tell her ahead of time I wasn't ready to talk about it with everyone and she dismissed me every time I tried to. She just kept giving me the cold stern teacher voice and said ""well if it affects the whole house the whole house needs to hear it."" I made the mistake of asking her if she thought Roommate A was mad at me and she said ""she's probably annoyed, it was supposed to be a house meeting.""

I've been getting advice to just smile and pretend everything is great for my survival but that isn't working. Typically she and I are able to talk about things like this and come to some sort of agreement but she's digging her heels in. The fact that I've heard both of them talk about people they know with mental illness and being compassionate towards them and then treat me like I'm some sort of disease for having a difficult time during a freaking pandemic.

I'm not sure what I'm doing on here I think I'm going nuts with the loneliness of it and I'm probably going to have to bring it up to her again. I'll make sure I'm careful about it and we discuss it at a time she's ready because I don't want to make the same mistake she did. I don't want her to hate me and I don't want to have to find another roommate but I don't think it's right that she put me through that and now I'm supposed to just shut up and deal. It feels really demoralizing.

127,"My girlfriend struggles with Depression, and Anxiety.  She has a therapist, but due to the circumstances, all of her suggested helping devices are not allowed (Seeing Friends, Doing outdoor Activities, Etc.) She has lost her motivation for her school work, and her personal hobbies, such as exercising, and knitting.  She is coping with food, and feel bad about herself afterwards, because she is gaining weight with this.

She has battled mental health for a few years now, but she was forced to move back into her house, where a lot these issues originated from.  She says before it was individual issues, but now it seems like all of them are coming at her all at once.  It seems her bedroom at her home is a trigger for a lot of these? She also can only have contact with her Mom and Dad, and her sister, brother in law, and her 2 nephews.   This is because she baby sits her nephews, because their parents are working in hospitals and she has to self quarantine.  I have thought about visiting, but I am hesitant to because I live with my parents who are 60 and 57.

128,"Hey, 

I'm 26M

I've had a lot of childhood trauma,albeit not like the one you usually see in the movies, but it was trauma enough to leave a lot of scars that I continue to deal with.

My parents did not invest enough in my early childhood education, didnot encourage me to take up sports, I was beaten occasionally, verbally abused and also bullied by classmates and cousins alike.

Now, I see that one of my parent seems to have changed from the time when I was young.

But I still feel that the experiences I had when I was young still dictate my life pretty significantly.

I feel that I'm ugly, with no personality, no communication skills and I have never felt loved in my life, despite having never lived physically alone.

Sometimes I also feel suicidal and think that maybe I should just end it all at once, but I beleive that I still deserve to give myself a second chance at life.

How do I start afresh and let go of all my insecurities and scars.

Also, I dont think I can afford therapy at this point in time, so please give me that ""Go get a therapist""-Bull crap.

134,"Hello everyone.

So over the last 5 years or so, a lot has changed with my life. Main points being:

\-Me and my then girlfriend/now wife moved out of our parent's houses and began living together, paying bills etc.

\-We got married.

\-We have moved on three occasions.

\-We adopted a cat.

\-Moving in and out of a couple of jobs (worked in mail order for 5 years, just started a new job in the last month in a factory).

\-Have had two children: one two years ago and one last week.

Now I'm sure that a lot of the above has played into what I'm about to describe, but I just wanted some opinions/advice from whoever I willing to listen (thank you so much in advance to anyone who does, by the way. It means a lot).

Over the course of the last 5 years, I have noticed a variety of issues cropping up mentally. I have tried to list the main issues below:

\-My energy levels and concentration have dipped. I will find myself reading stuff, but not actually taking in what I'm reading. Reading longer passages reduces down to just ""Glazing over"" the words and skimming whatever I pick up.

\-I can get a lot more irritable. I feel like every little thing has been sent to distract or annoy me. Every little sound feels like its layering and latering in my head. I've described it to my wife as ""feeling cursed"". An example from today: My wife had a routine hospital appointment for the new baby today. We don't drive, so her mother took her and the baby to the hospital. My eldest wanted to see her grandmother, so they decided to take her for the trip (staying in the car with the grandmother, due to the COVID19 stuff going on). I took the opportunity to try and relax for a bit, but then (as if responding to that thought) the phone went off and I had to talk to a family member for the next 10 minutes. This act isn't a problem at all, but i felt like this new distraction was sent just to disturb that now rare chance for relaxation and quiet.

\-I love video games. I love palying them and I love researching their history and watching stuff on youtube about them. However, my enjoyment of playing games seems to have been (for lack of a better term) ""rounded off"". I still enjoy them, but I don't feel fulfilled or buzzed by them, like I used to. To reiterate, I'm not bored of them or feel like I'm out of love with games. I still actively enjoy sitting down and playing through the next chapter of Dragon Quest 11. I just don't feel as fulfilled. It almost feels like guilt; like I should be doing something else like housework.

\-In extension to the above point, I feel like the only tasks worth doing on a day out are housework, or anything that isn't self-indulgent. 

\-I find myself pacing around the living room, not being able to sit down for longer than 5 minutes. I feel the act of sitting down to be pointless, in case I need to be up do sort something out (change nappies, wash dishes, vacuum the floor).

\-I can get anxious about anthing that threatens change, especially financially. For example, in the UK we have a benefits system that needs to be updated ifmy circumstances change (new job, address, etc.). Just filling this out makes me anxious. ""What if filling this out negatively affects the household income? What if i do something wrong and it all screws up?"" some thoughts I can have doing this sort of stuff. These thoughts also bleed into my full-time job. ""What if I do something stupid and lose my job?"" and more recently ""What if our factory closes because of COVID and I have to live off sick pay?"". You get the idea.

A few extra points that I feel to be relevant:

\-My diet could be better, I'm not gonna lie. I could do with drinking more water (normally gravitate to coffee or tea), and I could go for less carbs, more veg etc.

\-My eyes are constantly feeling tired, despite recently having eye exams and starting to wear glasses. Glasses have screen protection too, to help with computer work/gaming.

\-My wife has had an extensive history with mental health, including PTSD and Depression. She's doing considerably better these days, but it's kinda fallen on me to deal with the financial side of things, as well as a lot of the household responsbilities because of her condition.

\-To be absolutely clear, I love my family and my children immensely. Although I do think a lot of my stresses are caused by being a parent and husband, they instill more purpose into my life than anything.

I do feel like persuing the mental health services might help me out, but I don't really want to go down that route just yet (mainly due to the existing stress in the health sector at the moment, as well as not wanting to take too much time off from my new job during the proabtionary period). And I know that I shouldn't take the advice of strangers over that of a professional therapist. I was just wondering if anyone else has been through a similar state of mind, and has any advice that could help?

139," Friends &amp; I suffer from schizophrenia or psychosis &amp; most have a reoccurring history with drugs. The ones still using almost exclusively use THC. There symptoms seem to be exacerbated while ""high"" but they all say it is a releving sensation. While the majority and myself included had minor symptoms prior to engaging drug use become more symptomatic after heavy use of drugs. Even after abstinence from substances for multiple years the symptoms don't fade. Anecdotal words for this experiences effect are ""hatching schizophrenia"", ""perma-fried"", ""pandoras box/key"" and ""shattering/breaking from the fall"". Just as common is that most attempt to abstain from drugs but frequently relapse, in the name of self-medicating, finding at least temporary solace from painful symptoms with drug use. All while knowing that it may very well be a huge factor to inducing symptoms. More anecdotal terms for this experienced effect ""putting out the fire with gas"", ""growing/maturing schizophrenia"", ""boxing the clown"" (those clowns that pop back harder the stronger you punch) and ""overwhelming the symptoms"".

Is there any any studies or information on this subject? What drives the urge to relapse? Why can some people do the same/more amount of drugs and never experience these situations?

142,"My partner of 7 years finally opened up about how he feels a lot of the time.

 This weekend our neighbours that live above us have been really loud and annoying. They've been this way since they've moved in - starting to drill holes in the middle of the night and later really loud and frequent parties. In the beginnig they were reasonable and quieted down after we confronted them but eventually they'd just ignore us when we'd go up an ring or knock on the door. We complaind to our landloard and for a few month we didn’t have any bigger problems with them. My husband started to sleep with earplugs because any noise now will stress him out intensely. Saturday night I couldn’t sleep because of the noise, I knocked and ringed but they just ignored me – I probably should’ve called the police but that seems like the last measure I told him about it and that is when he started to be kinda depressed.

For the last three days he’s been very sad, not eating and having troubles with his digestion even. He told me how much our living situation stresses him. He can’t ever relax and he feels out of control, even like a prisoner in our flat because we really can’t do anything against the noise but he told me even more: That he constantly worries about everything and that every little mistake he makes everyday stresses him out the same and sometimes he even has some OCD-ey thoughts such as: “If I don’t do this (for example walking on a specific side of the road) and that something terrible is going to happen to people that I love…”. For me that really explains a lot about why we sometimes fight a lot about silly things and why I’ve felt distant at times. He told me he was scared to tell me because he thought I would judge him or not love him and such. 

I want to know how I could support him – and what he could do to feel better, gain control of his feelings an thoughts. I allready proposed seeing a doctor about that but with the Covid19 situation that won’t be happening soon – he didn’t oppose but he wants to first try it himself.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wdys/new/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wdys/new/)  


Wanted to field out your thoughts about whether or not you think it's a good idea - before I put more time into developing it.

I'll C&amp;P the description to explain my thinking:

&gt;This is a mental health subreddit designed to help people with anxiety and depression challenge damaging beliefs that they hold about themselves. How it works: users can post anonymously giving partial details about their life or post real details about themselves. The description should include or conclude with ""What do you see when you see me?"". Please try to be supportive and help challenge posters' unfounded self-judgments. Malicious or troll responses will be removed.

That's the idea basically.

E.g. I would probably post from a throwaway perhaps explaining who I am, where I live, what I do for a  living. I may or may not include the opinions I hold about myself (""I'm a total failure"" / ""at this age I should really own a car""). And the idea is that respondents would help the posters see themselves from a place of empathy and challenge the critical self-beliefs that are a big part of perpetuating depression (and which certainly cause suffering).

What do you guys think? Can it work?",14Apr2020,0
148,"My mind is going on yet another rant about how much I hate myself. I can't help but compare myself to a petulant child who always whines that they don't want to do something. 

At that analogy I noticed that holy shit, when *was* the last time I did something purely because I wanted to? Not because I felt obliged, or was told to, or simply because there's too much time in a day to gaze at an empty wall so I had to fill that time with *something*. 

It's sad to realise I really don't even draw or read or write because I want to but just because something within me is yelling at me to get things done or else I fall way behind and don't improve. I can't remember when I last woke up and decided to do something just because it seemed inviting and like a fun activity. I'm even starting to wonder what it's like to do things purely because you want to. Do people really do that??",14Apr2020,5
149,"This morning I'm feeling really weird. I woke up and I don't feel like myself. Like, I know my surroundings, where everything is, my family, and my pets in my home. But at the same time everything seems oddly unfamiliar. Just writing this on my phone feels weird. I have the muscle memory to know that I'm in the right place, but it sort've feels like I'm in somebody else's body. I have depression, anxiety, ptsd, and add, but I've never had this feeling before. I just feel really confused as to what I'm doing here.  I'm not sure if something like this has happened to anyone here, but I would really like some insight on what might be happening to me. Thank you.",14Apr2020,2
150,"Sorry, I'm new to Reddit so sorry in advance if I say/do something wrong. In case it's important to know, I have been clinically diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and ADHD. 

Every time I complete anything, whether it be a list of chores or a school assignment, part of my brain screams at me for not doing it well enough. That I should've done *this* instead of *that*, or I should have chosen choice 2 rather than choice 1. It's just a constant reminder of my inadequacy in everything I do. I never do anything right...

On the other hand, though, for every action I take a different part of me is cheering and exclaiming how I never screw up and am immune to failure and that I'm the apex human and I'm constantly improving even without trying. It makes it very clear that I'm better than anyone or anything else and no one will surpass me. I always do everything perfectly!

I need some sort of explanation as to why this is happening. Not necessarily a solution yet, but just some kind of clarification as to what this could mean.",14Apr2020,4
151,"I’m lucky enough to work at a Dunkin’ Donuts so I’m a essential worker, so I get to still work. But usually I get to be at school or with friends so I don’t really think about my medical issues. I’m infertile which sucks cause I really want kids. Anyways, I become lonely cause I’m extroverted and etc. Don’t get me wrong I don’t have a hard bad life by any means; but there are a few aspects that are really upsetting to me.

I try my best not to think negatively but I can't do it. I do not love myself at all. Nobody loves me either. I do not have a core personality for myself. I always ""adapt to changes"" and mould myself to fit in with others. I do not enjoy what I am doing with my life right now. I just want to drop out of school and start working. Life is just dull and boring, I do not enjoy my life anymore. I have always wanted to kill myself, but Im afraid of dying. I just wish that I have more friends to talk to and support me whenever I need help. I wish to die now. Hope this isn't my last post on reddit 😭😭😭.",14Apr2020,1
153,I (23f) met a guy when I was 21 who I had sex with on a regrettable night and became attached to. I’ve been raised to not have sex until marriage which made it toxic for me and basically attached me to this man that is fully taking advantage of it. Calling me his bitc* and slu* and I keep going back. The fights get so ugly and we say the Nastiest things to each other. I never thought I’d be speaking to a man like this. I can’t stop messaging him or contacting him I literally can’t. I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom and I don’t know how to get out of it. Any time things go wrong in my life I resort to fighting with him and back to the toxicity of the so called relationship. He wouldn’t block me because he enjoyed watching me be this way. He finally did today after a big fight and I’ve just messaged him again on another platform apologising. I feel so low I don’t know what is wrong with me. I know how bad i look but I just can’t stop it’s like an addiction. I hate myself for it and it makes me sad how low I have stooped. He sent me pictures of him and others girls. I’m literally that crazy bitch now. I’m too embarrassed to tell anyone what’s going on it’s not in my character. I don’t know how to get out of this,14Apr2020,1
154,"No matter what I did in life my mother would always criticise it. Usually her only argument was and still is, that she'd do it differently, implying that only her way is the right way. 

In order to avoid her criticism, I started fabricating lies about what I did or thought, although I never liked the idea of lying to her, but it made me feel less bad then her constanting berating all of my choices and actions.

Recently I have been thinking about what kind of person I'd like to be as part of my therapy progress and I have figured out, that I don't want to lie to her anymore. Or to anyone else for that matter. 

So I was thinking about writing her a letter (most likely an e-mail but that is the same thing, just different media IMHO), where I would like to admit that I lied to her a lot, apologize, explain why I lied to her and why I have decided not to anymore. I was also thinking about clarifying a few things about my life that I lied to her about so we can start rebuilding our trust from there.

Even so part of me is scared to do this because there is a rather high possibility that she might not read the whole thing, just the part where I admit I lied to her which is going to offend her greatly, as she didn't deserve such treatment from me (she has never recognised that I might have mental health issues, let alone because of her behaviour in the past), which would make our relationship several times worse than it already is. Which is the opposite of what I am hoping for.

I don't want to send her anything when I am conflicted about it. I would also like to state that I plan to write the whole thing in a way, that focuses on my feelings without trying to accuse her of anything. Just something like: ""Hi, mom, I lied to you about a bunch of things, because I didn't want to make you mad/be dissapointed in me, but I have realized that it was a mistake and I don't want to do it anymore. So I'd like to apologize and hope that we can somehow start over."" Just a bit more refined and explanatory.

Do you think it is a good idea? I'd usually consult my therapist about things like this but he is unavailable to me until the end of May, so I thought I'd try getting some feedback here.

159,"I’m sorry if this doesn’t belong here but... Pretty much as the title says, my parents don’t believe that mental health is a thing and they certainly don’t think that I should have any mental health issues. 

I unfortunately suffer from Bipolar Disorder II, PTSD, and Tourette syndrome. I recently got medicated for Bipolar and have been doing so much better. I go to weekly therapy sessions and see a psychologist on a monthly basis. I moved to a different country to start a life away from my parents as they were one of the key problems surrounding my mental health. 

As an only child it’s near impossible to cut my parents off fully. They’re on mute in my phone so I don’t get notifications from them and I do feel I should keep them in the loop when it comes to my well-being. It’s comments like “what if you didn’t take you medication and you were just you” that really anger me because they have no idea what I’m going through. 

I have tried to explain what bipolar feels like. To which my mother has shot me down and dismissed the idea. I’ve sent them information to read and short videos to watch that explain it too. They don’t seem interested to learn about what I’m going through at all. It’s always dismissed. 

I’m sick of them asking me about it and then getting annoyed about it before turning their nose up and changing the subject. Why ask when you don’t like the answer?! 

I am so sorry to rant about this but I cannot take their constant criticism anymore. I can’t continue to “please” people that don’t want the truth. All my life I have been controlled and for the most part they still try to control me from another country and 6 hours ahead of me. 

“Well why didn’t you tell us?” Please God tell me you are joking? Oh you’re not joking!? Anything that’s different is not a good thing to my parents. Different is different for a reason and it’s not a good one. They’re the reason for my the majority of my issues and why can’t they accept I’m not okay?! 

I have never been accepted for who I am but I’m not about to fake who I am. I believe my parents should accept me for who I am and the issues I have. Don’t you think if I had the choice to be “normal” I would be? No medication, no mental health issues, no physical disability?! But that’s not who I am!! I am **proud** to be different. I am proud to have tattoos (which my parents HATE). I am proud of who I was yesterday, who I am today, and who the fuck I will be tomorrow. 

If you got this far, thank you for reading! Take care of yourselves my loves!",14Apr2020,36
160,"I'd like to start out by saying that I am not trying to super self-diagnose... I am 100% willing to accept that this is not what I have, it is just a suspicion. I just would like advice for an upcoming appointment (my first one ever) with a psychiatrist. 

Basically, I think I have ADHD, but I'm not sure that I should tell the psychiatrist my suspicions. I don't want them to think that I'm trying to score study drugs or whatever (I live in a college town) but I do want to be heard. My symptoms line up to a T with the DSM 5 (and I'll list them below) so maybe they will be more receptive? I'm worried they will brush me off.

Also, I did take adderall the other day to see how it affected me, and 10mg XR just calmed me down like crazy. I cried because I actually felt normal. I want to tell the psych this, but I'm scared that this will really make them think I'm looking to score drugs. I don't care about that at all... if there's a non-stimulant treatment I'll go that route, even. Is this something I should tell them? 

My symptoms (if you're interested):

~ I need something playing in the background at all times (usually, I just play the same shows on repeat) and I can't focus without it. I just don't like to sit in the quiet. But I also can't focus when it's on. It's like I need that noise, but when its there, I can't function with it. 

~ I dissociate often, but Im not sure if that's the right word. I get really aware of my peripheral vision and it feels like I'm in a movie. People move too fast and don't seem real... this is scary. I think this is do to some sexual trauma, though. 

~ I zone out frequently. Like 25% of my day is spent vividly daydreaming. I also can't seem to focus on what people are saying to me. In conversation I usually get distracted because I'm paying attention to the fact that I need to pay attention, or something they say will remind me of something, and my mind will just go off on a tangent. 

~ Procrastination. I am horrible about this, but its not like I'm just being lazy. I just get so worked up thinking that have to do something, and I spend more time worrying about it than I would take to do it. I also don't just do stuff I want to do, instead. The anxiety makes it to where it wouldn't even be enjoyable. Ive taken trig three times now bc of this, and I havent read 1 book I've been assigned all the way through since high school, and I'm an English major! I just can't get through books, especially when assigned. I have to constantly re-read things. Still, I had a 3.9 in H.S. and a 3.6 now.

~ I am incredibly forgetful. I constantly forget to turn assignments in on time, even though I have it on my calendar and I check it every day, and I always pay my bills late, even though I have plenty of $ to pay them with. I also find myself losing things like my phone, keys, clothes, etc. twenty times a day. As soon as I set something down I forget it. 

~I monopolize conversations, and interrupt people a lot, though I don't usually notice until its pointed out to me. I really, really try to keep in mind to be polite, but I swear its like I can't help it. I just have to say what I want to say, and I can't seem to pay attention until I say it. Honestly I think I'm just really annoying to others, but I actively try not to be. 

~I have very fidgety habits, including, but not limited to: nail biting, picking at lips/pimples/skin, grinding my teeth, bouncing my leg... just really, constantly fidgeting. 

~ I struggle with sleep issues. 

~ I'm always, always late, even when I leave myself plenty of time to get ready and its something I want to do. 

I'm just not sure. Does this sound like ADHD to you guys? Should I bring up my concerns with my doctor, or will that make my situation worse?

162,"No idea if this is the right subreddit to post this, but here we go:

Just like most of humans, I don't really recall my childhood. I have bits of memories but nothing fancy.

However, there's like a big chunk that's missing and it's quite bothering me. Deep down, I know I can't remember something but I have no idea what that thing is.
For instance, I had a muscle tear around my hip. And from then, I have been dealing with terribly sharp pains. Yet, I have no idea how it might have happened.
According to my mother, it happened when I helped her carry something heavy, but I don't remember it. It's odd, right? I would've remembered something like that? 

I had another muscle tear in high school and I vividly remember how that one happened. So why did I forget the one that still pains me to this day? 

I'm don't think it has to deal with PTSD. I don't remember going through something traumatic and my family doesn't act as if I did go through something bad.

Well, I am so ashamed of myself. I was never raised like this before but recently I have become so materialistic and I would count and judge people upon food. I look at what they cook and their food. I hate myself for it and struggle with the thought. I feel so low because I am not a good cook and so whenever anyone cooks around me I cannot keep myself from looking. i have this feeling that I no longer stand eating in group with anyone around. I started to take my food to my room and eat there alone. They would still think I dont want to eat with them because I dont want to share. Part of it because my cooking is so terrible that I cannot let anyone taste it. I dont want another judgment or criticism from anyone. The other part is I think food is a scarcity and I dont have enough to share. What if I am still hungry? 

Recently, I had been invited to someone’s room and I couldnt help but keep looking around. My eyes just land on so much stuff that I am in a terrible situation where its awkward to keep turning around. It awkward that I try to look down but its just doesnt work. The other day I was invited in and I kept staring at a closet trying to figure out what is it? I know its none of my business but I couldnt help my eyes went to that direction. Same goes to their bathroom. They had stuff stored below the sink. I kept looking at it. I just felt so weird. 

The worst part is that I had noticed before someone checking out my things and trying to look the other direction. It felt awkward too. As I didnt know should I react? Should I say something? I just let go. Why be so sensitive. 

The worst part is that, I feel that my dormmates are able to feel that low energy of me. They notice my pettiness. They can see that I am looking at their things. I feel so horrible and so despicable with myself for being so low and cheap. Even though technically, I dont need any of their things. Honestly, I am financially more stable than most of them. Yet, its just being low that looking at their things seem interesting somewhat. I feel that they can see that through me. I feel so exposed, that even when they offer me things I automatically refuse to keep my dignity. Yet, since I moved to this place I became so stingy. I am unemployed living off savings. Trying to take advantage of anything and everything. I try to play it cool sometimes but there is just not much opportunity to hide my face expression of my eyes gazing. I am so disgusted with myself to look at someone else’d food. Not being able to share or offer any. 

I am avoiding the kitchen and food topics with all of them. I leave whenever they start cooking. I try to wake up early just so no one see me eating or cooking. Yet, we share the fridge so they can see what grocery I have. I dont buy many and I just eat outside. 

There are three or four girls I am talking about: one of them is unfortunately my crush. Whenever she says anything, a mean voice in my head replies with a disgusting response. I am paranoid if anyone could hear it or feel how I am feeling towards them. 

I wish I could up to people talk to them without thinking about their food or their belongings. Just straight to their face. I tried to pay for them few times to show them its not about money, but I deep down count every penny. I feel something isnot right. My instinct and my guilt to being mean and unforgiven to those around me. 

Why do I care anyone’s food or cooking? Why do I put myself in this competition? How is it that I need to see what everyone is storing in their room? Its none of my business! I wish I could clear my head when walking up to anyone without thinking about how will they “feed” me or offer me food. Or perhaps, what did they buy? Or how could they have been able to afford it since they are on minimum wage? 

My friend was telling me how she shops at some stores and I was literally replying in my mind: “oh yeah as if you can afford it” shame on me!!! Seriously I am a disgusting human being. I shouldnt be thinking that way. Its none of my business. Even if I am curious how did she do it, I shouldnt be going into that intrusive thought. 

All what I mentioned about food and material things are against my nature. I was never raised like that. I come from an upper middle class family. I was sent abroad for my higher education. I wear brands. I have suffient money and I am doing well in life. Why judge those people around me? With what they eat and what they wear? And what they buy? 

They stuff their things like in public that there is no way not to look. Its all over the room. You cannot just enter without noticing. Its awkward to look at it and awkward to try to look into the other direction. I feel so low.

Please tell me how to get over this disgusting habit.

I have been diagnosed with anxiety/depression (as it feels like the rest of the world has too) for a few years. I was just watching a therapist react to Trisha Paytas. Trish said that she becomes whoever she’s around and the therapist suggested that was a symptom of another disorder he didn’t want to get into. I have always had the same problem as Trish described and I feel like I don’t know who the fuck I am. It literally drives me up a fucking wall. I feel alone. So I looked up “what is it called when you act like who you’re around,” or something like that. Borderline Personality Disorder popped up. I read through all of the symptoms and traits and I truly believe this is what I have. I have been to psychologists and psychiatrists for years, but I’ve only been diagnosed with anxiety and depression.

170,"I say this as someone who's had a lot of very bad and even long-term harmful therapy experiences.  A lot of people talk like it's not a big deal because you can just walk away at any point.  And most of the time that's been technically true.

But I don't think people realize what that actually entails.  A very common feature of bad therapy experiences is the way the relationship creates dependence, in some way or another.  I want to be clear here that experiences like mine don't involve any sort of overt ethical breach, and often take place with therapists who are otherwise well regarded and have been helpful to many other people.  

There was a very **very** strong overall message, I found, that as the person with mental illness you weren't capable of judging if therapy was working or not and needed to trust the therapist.  It's constant messages like ""therapy is hard"" and ""it gets worse before it gets better"" and a bunch of messages that encourage you to see therapy feeling horrible as normal and necessary.  (I've noticed there's usually no counterbalance here to differentiate between temporary difficulty and therapy problems.)  There was also a heavy emphasis on things like ""therapy is difficult and you can't get better unless you work hard"" and ""you won't get better unless you're willing to push through the hard parts.  Often it's messages like ""it's natural for your defense mechanisms to make you think that therapy isn't working, because change is scary.""  And at the end it's frequently things like ""maybe you just aren't ready to get better"" or something.

And these things weren't just coming from the therapists I saw.  It was a constant push from everyone else as well.  A constant cheerleading to stay the course and stick with your treatment until you get better.  And it seems that no one - not therapists, not anyone else, no one - ever considered the possibility that therapy might simply not be helping at all, or even might be making things worse.  There was a strong message, both in and out of therapy, that walking away from therapy was irresponsible and a choice to give in to your illness.  There was also a heavy push that if you weren't in therapy, that meant you shouldn't be getting any other help either - because you were just using them as a crutch and if you actually wanted to get better you'd be in therapy.

With many years of hindsight now, it's obvious that the therapists I saw badly misunderstood what was actually going on.  I've also learned over the years that, depending on what you actually have going on, it's not uncommon to spend years being misdiagnosed and mistreated.  (Many therapists are, from what I can tell, actually quite poor at recognizing and treating issues other than depression or anxiety, especially without any blatantly obvious other symptoms.)  I was getting therapy that wasn't suitable for what I actually had going on.  But the whole structure was set up to shift the blame to me for not cooperating or somehow doing therapy wrong, or to reframe any issues as evidence that therapy was actually working after all.

That's often why we don't walk away.  Because you're taking someone who's already at a low point and often already uncertain of themselves.  And you're putting them in a situation that shifts everything onto *them* for saying therapy is causing problems.  Walking away takes being able to break from a therapy relationship that's pushing you to rely on the therapist, as well as tuning out all the ""supportive"" people in your life who are pushing you to stick with it.  And that's a major undertaking.

I think there needs to be a lot more responsibility on the therapist than there currently is to ensure the client is safe and actually being helped.",14Apr2020,6

 When i was younger i had this sort of 'episode'. I was lying in bed when everything just seemed off. Next thing i know there are bugs crawling everywhere, the room is shrinking and expanding, numbers and colours everywhere. Music started blasting and the voices awoke. I ended up having an accident out of fear and pure shock. Now i don't know what the duck it was so i just brushed it off and carried on like nothing happened. The music and voices never stopped.

I would get visions of hurting anyone i saw. Like if i saw someone walking down the street the visions would start flashing of me stabbing or killing them.

I would find myself doing thing i never would do. Started harming animals but couldn't stop it. Even this one time i made a nail bomb my shoving modified fire crackers under hedgehogs or inside when they curl up. Pretty funny tbh.

My behaviour became more dangerous to myself. I would walk out into traffic without caring for myself or anyone on the road(crossing without looking on main roads even though i know there are cars). Cars would end up slamming onto the brakes because i cant stop myself walking into traffic.


 So just after new years(many years ago), me and my family were living on a farm with a massive like 8-9 bedroom house. Now in this house there was no central heating so log fires were in every room. One night i was sent upstairs to light the fires to keep the house warm during the -40°c winters. The second episode hits... Again the rooms starts shrinking and expanding and the voices get louder and louder. Next thing i know i set the bed on fire and went downstairs as all was normal. I knew what was going on but couldn't stop it or myself. I go into the dining room to light the log burner in there. By this time i forget what just happened so as I'm lighting the log burner i hear crackling coming from the ceiling. It took a good few seconds to click before i realise what just happened. I ran upstairs as fast as i could but it was too late. The entire 2nd floor was engulfed in flames (singed some hairs when i went up). I ran back down screaming to everyone to get out. Thankfully no one was hurt and all made it out. The house continued to burn for 2 days.
No one knows it was me. They blamed faulty electrics.

We ended up homeless for a while after this and ended up moving back to UK. We were still homeless but managed to get by until we found somewhere to settle.

Now as i have gotten older the music, voices and visions are getting louder and stronger. Im losing control of my actions. I got really bad a year ago and ended up shoving a knife in my leg. Dont know why but i couldnt stop myself. Im scared that soon it wont be my leg next time. I feel as if i need to be sectioned before i end up hurting anyone else.

What ever is wrong it has cost me my jobs, education and life. I spend most of my days staring at my wall on what feels like a very bad acid trip 24/7 whilst simultaneously being on grams of sniff. It wont stop and i dont know what to do.",14Apr2020,2

It's been weeks since I had above 4 hours of sleep. I do not know what to do anymore. I try to paint or do something that's tasking but I feel nausea/sick 24/7 due to my high anxiety.

I also experience shivers all day(no, I am not sick, this is 100% stress induced) and since I lack appetite I've visually lost a lot of weight within the 3 days I did not eat(you don't say? but this stresses me out even more and I still haven't eaten anything). Along with my shivers I have the *lovely* feeling of 10,000 butterflies on crack in my stomach all the time. Does anyone else also feel that?

180,"On one hand, you have a lot of people who don't care about their mental health and do absolutely nothing to cure it. These people develop binge eating disorders, become alcoholics, become overweight, sit on their asses all day, and socially isolate themselves to the point of extreme depression, yet they don't take any effort to get help.

On the other hand, you have a lot of people pointing fingers left and right and labeling everyone as mentally ill. These people will not hesitate to file wellness checks against anyone they suspect of being the slightest bit depressed and will gladly encourage a perfectly healthy human being to take tranquilizing drugs instead of actually fixing their emotional problems.

182,"Hey guys, so a quick backstory. I got diagnosed with depression and some other small stuff a few months ago. Well it wasn't a real diagnosis I guess, because I was at the hospital at the time and the people who diagnosed me didn't even knew everything about me. I'm pretty sure they were right about the depression though.

Right now I can't see my therapist anymore because of the lockdown, the last time I saw her was like 6 weeks ago and I'm really struggling with that. I'm on medication against the depression and that issue is actually starting to get a bit better, but I just know that there's something else going on with me.

So I started to read more about mental health and came across personality disorders. I never really heard anything about that before or would have considered it to be something that could affect me. Just for fun (at first) I took a test about personality disorders. I had very high scores at borderline, avoidant personality disorder, paranoid personality disorder and ocd. I didn't take that seriously though and thought it was just some test I couldn't trust.

But then I read more about these disorders and it was like I was reading an explanation of myself when I read two of them. Especially BPD is something I can extremely relate to. But I still don't trust something I only found on the internet and I would never call my therapist to ask her stuff, because I'm wayy to anxious to do anything like that. So I was wondering if someone maybe knows some resources, tests, idk anything I could trust on that topic. I know it's not the same as actually seeing my therapist, but I just can't right now and I'm literally going crazy here and I need to know what's wrong with me. 

I would really appreciate it if someone could help me. Thank you, have a great day :)",14Apr2020,1

185,"Without giving too much away about myself, I'm between 20-30 and I currently attend an elite university in the United States. As I am both working my way through 5 challenging classes and studying for the LSAT, my new life under quarantine is essentially dedicated to studying. Last night, while making dinner, I lost consciousness and collapsed to the ground. I had just been exercising more than usual, so my day of stressful mental and physical activity likely took its toll. A day later, I seem to be experiencing symptoms of high blood pressures and hypertension.

Today I did something awful. Due to the virus my classes are online. So our tests are online and we have the physical ability to access our notes and the internet. Generally we are allowed to do so. But for one class we weren't. Before the exam we had to sign an ""academic integrity"" agreement saying we wouldn't use notes or internet. I underperformed on the last exam, and in a moment of cowardice and weakness I signed the agreement only to use my notes and internet for the exam. I'm sure I'm not the only one who did this, and to my knowledge there's no way that the professor can see whether or not I did. But the fact is I lied and I broke academic integrity. I feel awful, like I don't deserve to live. How could I have done that? Why? I could get expelled! I feel like a criminal and a failure. I couldn't have gotten 100%, could I? If so, won't the professor get suspicious and ask to access my Google data? He could find evidence that I lied and I could get expelled. I am a failure.

I'm a 17M, and have grown up in a small mountain town for a few years now, and all in all, I live a pretty introverted, asocial lifestyle. I feel no motivation to really do anything other than things that give me an adrenaline or dopamine rush; everything else just seems bland, and pointless. I mean, after all, why should I do school work when I know I can pass no problem even if I hand in nothing? It sounds like a flex, but I honestly hate it; none of my work has any meaning to me, and I have to do something incredible before I see any point in talking about it.  


To the point though, lately (the past eight months or so) I've been experiencing really unhealthy behavior. Whenever I disappoint either myself, or someone else through a variety of means - losing a round in highly-competitive games, upsetting my girlfriend, disappointing my parents through a lack of effort - I start feeling disgusting. I start feeling like I'm absolutely worthless, and that I **deserve** punishment. I've thought about suicide, but never actually tried or truly wanted to try. This obviously leads to self-harm; I've scratched, and I've even bit myself to the point of blood. I've slammed my forearm against my desk, and I've even felt the need to push all my furniture to the side and lie on the floor because I'm scared I might use something to hurt myself.  


Lately, and this is where the issue comes into play, I've actually started enjoying it, in a really sick way. The adrenaline rush from hurting myself, or even just eating insane amounts of really spicy food so that my mouth burns, is honestly one of the best adrenaline rushes I've ever felt. I hate it, since it makes me feel even more like scum.  


I've tried seeking help before: my girlfriend is convinced my only problem is that I've convinced myself that I need help, my best friend is supportive but thinks I'm melodramatic, my dad tells me to 'cheer up', and my mom is convinced it's just me being a teenager, despite having mental health support qualifications through her government job.

I know that the stigma I grew up with of “just getting over it” probably contributes to me not really being at peace with the diagnosis, but something else that has popped up in my mind is Borderline Personality Disorder. I feel that the way that my symptoms are more anger induced than sadness, and also all the the symptoms that show up situationally in someone with BPD is more aligned with what I am feeling, more so than just depression. However I don’t believe in self diagnosing so I won’t ever bring myself to believe I have that either without a professional giving me a formal diagnosis. **Should I bring up  to my therapist how I believe my symptoms are more akin to something she didn’t diagnose me with?

From my own personal research I can safely say that I believe this is a form of depersonalisation/derealisation. Though I may just be very tired all the time I can't help but feel that I experienced life in a different way before this all started. Two things I can think of may have caused this:

\- A heavy night of drinking I had at a get together

\- (I know it sounds stupid but) A night where I had a very deep conversation about existence, death, etc. with my friends

i feel like i had experienced one a few days ago but im not entirely sure. basically, someone (who i wasnt close with or talk to in real life) kept pressuring me that he wants to call me. i barely knew him. and i repeatedly told him no because i was uncomfortable with it. i dont like taking calls from people i dont know or people i dont talk to in real life. i cant seem to talk whenever i do. so i avoid it. 

but he kept insisting. and i thought it was fine because he finally apologized saying he would stop asking. but a few minutes later he kept asking again and i kept repeating my side. then he called. and i had no choice but to answer because he said he needed someone to talk to (and im a sucker for people who need a shoulder to cry on) and he kept talking,saying something about frontliners and cried a bit but i couldnt focus on what he was saying no matter how hard i tried. 

there was this spot in my chest that felt hot, heavy and ""nervous"" (sort of like how your heart feels when youre nervous but i doubt i was nervous back then or i dont know) and i really forced myself to focus on what he was saying but i really couldnt. then the call was cut short because of wifi issues (thankfully) and when the call ended, i grabbed my other hand to grip it and was surprised my hands felt cold. a few seconds later i was full on crying. i dont know why i was crying. but it felt good to cry,the feeling in my chest went away.

after crying, the feeling came back and i had to listen to music when i slept that day (it was sort of 4 almost 5 am when he called tbh) because i couldnt sleep the feeling in my chest wouldnt allow me to. and now every time he messages me or whenever i see his name on my dms the feeling in my chest keeps returning. 

maybe it wasnt a panic attack but id like an outside perspective of what that is. im not really good with figuring out my emotions",14Apr2020,1

My problem being is my mind is very dark. I have some visions of very violent self-mutilation, things that I wouldn’t even be capable of. Although these ideas flow through my mind, I would never hurt myself or another person. I love life and I haven’t had any self harm or suicidal ideation for almost a decade. I am terrified that it will not be seen the same way though.

199,"Sorry for the long post I just really need to let this all out. Not really looking for advice or anything, I just wanna know if anyone understands what I’m going through. 

I’m a university student but bc of the quarantine I’ve been at home for over a month now and I feel like I’m falling apart. 

I’ve never really had a great relationship w my parents and my relationship with my brother has a lot of ups and downs. 
I have friends that I can talk to but I don’t want them to be annoyed with all my drama. 

I’m only ever allowed to do something if my older brother is with me, and so everything that I do is regulated by what he wants. If I want to go for a walk/drive and he doesn’t then I can’t go. He will have his friends over (they still social distance outside) and I’m expected to hang out with them but I can’t make the decision to hang out w MY friends. 
My schedule for my entire life has always been dictated by what other people want. I toured my brothers school with him and helped him move in. 
When I wanted to tour a school, my brother and dad didn’t come but kept telling me to hurry up bc they were bored and wanted to leave the city.

My parents fully support what my brother is studying and doesn’t mind that he’s changed his degree three times but if I switch courses or question what I want to do in the future I’m torn apart (getting yelled at and told that they always knew they couldn’t trust me and that I’ve been lying to them and that I’m disgraceful and horrible) 

Last summer we both worked but he always went out after (worked until 10) and if I wasn’t home by 9:30 (worked until 9) I was told to come back and that it was too late for me to be out.  If there’s ever an issue with who gets the car I lose every single time.  
Every time I show emotion I’m degraded for being dramatic but anyone else can say whatever they want.  

And now I’m quarantine I feel like I’m in prison and I can’t do anything abt it. 

I can’t focus on my school work at all which only makes me feel worse. I’m also trying to get diagnosed w a learning disability but I can’t until this virus is over and that just means that I have to struggle through online schooling. 

Every time I try to take control of my life it’s a mess, I’m financially dependant on them for school, but also despite everything I’m not ready to cut them off, they are still my family. So every time I talk about moving after school or changing plans I’m threatened that they will stop supporting me. 

I’m starting to give up. I don’t even think that anything is worth it anymore. I can’t  even get along with my family and I feel like I’ve given up a lot for them but I still get called selfish and disrespectful and dramatic if I ever complain. 

The longer quarantine goes on the more helpless I feel and I don’t want to keep going if this is going to be my life

I’m not going to hurt myself or anything but I’m literally just so drained and I’m caught in a cycle of feeling bad and then feeling dramaric for feeling bad which makes me feel worse.",14Apr2020,1
200,"Before I explain my question further, I'm just going to briefly tell my experience so skip to the last part if you don't want to read this. 

I experienced physical and verbal abuse from my nanny when I was 4/5 (I'm 18 now). Both of my parents work all day for me and my older siblings so they hired a nanny to take care of their youngest (me) while they work all day. She would hurt me every time I'm left alone with her at the house and when before my parents arrive she will remind me not to say a word or she will hurt me even more. Since I was so young my memory of it is kind of blurry but I can still remember her face and that way she made me feel. Imagine a skinny middle-aged lady with black hair and wide eyes. Now that I think of it, she's straight out of a horror film. I can still even feel her long and sharp nails digging to my skin. I don't know why she hated me, I thought maybe she thinks kids are annoying and being a nanny is her only way of making a living so she was exerting her frustrations at me. But then I remember that my brother who was 5 years older than me (making him 9/10 at that time) would sometimes be home with us too and she would be nice so nice to him and I would feel jealous and think that maybe something is wrong with me and that I'm just a bad child which she would always make me feel I am btw. Then I don't exactly remember what happened but my parents found out and she was immediately fired and the only thing I remember from that day when her flipping the middle at me when no one was looking before she left... kinda comedic ngl.


So I'm just wondering...

I'm an introverted, non confrontational and socially anxious person and I do have a few friends and I'm in the verge of losing all of them because I don't know how to maintain a relationship. I don't talk to them for days and days on purpose even though I know it's going to affect the relationship I've already established with them. I tend to distance myself a lot on people that I somehow already initiated I relationship with.

202,"Mental health is a very sensitive topic and as a result of that, it is difficult to experience and portray it in front of others. While the Internet has been helpful in logically understanding the issues that are present in today's individuals, it has always struggled with actually portraying how they affect humans. 

For the past months I have been watching a channel called Healthygamer, run by the psychiatrist, Doctor Alok Kanojia (Dr K) and what he has been trying to do with his approach to helping the audience with their problems has been enlightening to me. 

It is basically the evolution of group therapy in which everyone present gets to experience the other's problems and struggles right in front of them, but broadened to the whole internet. Through conducting therapy sessions live on [Twitch.TV](https://Twitch.TV) that allows the patients to express their fears openly I believe it has created something beautiful.

The fastest way to get there is by letting go of the current identity that we’re attached to

Try to observe during your day the different attachment you experience in the form of thoughts and emotions, simply witness them

True power lies in awareness, awareness acts as a fire to the different impurities that are creating problems in the different areas of our life.

If you’re having experience of the same inner patterns over and over again I guess that is time to realize a new level of awareness where you’ll be able to experience yourself and your reality from a completely different perspective :)

209,"So... I have this really weird food anxiety. I don't think it fits the criteria of an eating disorder. Food anxiety is the best way to describe it.

Basically, I get extremely anxious and stressed when I can't immediately access food, and this happens even when I'm not hungry AT ALL. The prospect of getting hungry and not being able to eat, even if it's mild hunger, just makes me want to throw up from stress. I carry snacks around with me everywhere I go. If I have plans at a place where I can't bring my snacks, I don't go. I stay home. 

I've been this way as long as I can remember. The thing is, I have NEVER been food deprived in my life. I had all the food I needed and wanted. Even when I went vegetarian in 8th grade, my parents immediately began cooking vegetarian food for me to eat.

My dad always joked that I must have died from starvation in a past life. Ha-ha. 

So whenever I leave my house, I assess how hard the logistics of getting food would be, then determine if I want to go out or not. Most places I can bring snacks, but this has certainty caused me to miss events.

Also, some days I compulsively check my pantry/fridge to make sure there is still enough for me if I got hungry. Sometimes I hide non perishables in my room in case my family eats all the food, so I'll be guaranteed to have some.

Also to be clear, I don't compulsively eat or eat too much or anything like that. I am on the thinner side of normal, and when I do eat, it's perfectly normal portion sizes and I don't eat until I start getting hungry. I'm not having an issue with the food itself, it's the idea of not having any.

This is my first ever post so I don't know all the formalities

I'll begin with where it all started,I don't remember exactly how old cause young self forced my mind to put it into the deepest part of my mind and tried to forget it ,but I think it was the summer and I was going into 1st grade or 2nd grade when it happened. I was over at a older cousin's house with my intermediate family for a relatively large family for what I assume was a holiday. Somehow me,sister(2 years older than me),and my 1 year old female cousin ended up in a back room where we were playing house.I don't remember what role my sister played but I was the husband and my cousin was the wife.It started as a completely harmless game house and completely traditional game of house with nothing out of the ordinary.At some point after a while of playing my cousin who was in the bed watching tv under the covers and told me to get in the bed under the covers as well.My young mind knew something was off or slightly unusual but still did as she said.Once in the bed she she told me to kiss her on the lips,I do believe I was pretty reluctant but I did kiss her.This continued about 12 times or so,she would give me an instruction then tell me to kiss her(all of this happening without either of us leaving the bed).I felt completely powerless without her ever restraining or laying a hand on me.After a while of this happening she told me to pull down her pant and after to kiss her again.I knew 100% this really shouldn't be a thing that was happening so I tried to be as slow as possible following the instruction.My really only vivid memory is while I was in the process the smell of butt cheeks(as somewhat funny as this sounds),this has caused me to have a flashback to the terrible event any time I smell that smell.Although I tried to be as slow as possible I did eventually did get her pant down but as I was going in to kiss we heard footsteps coming toward the room I quickly rushed to get out of the bed and got in natural position for kids playing house.Then my cousin(Around 25F)whose room it was came in and us to clean up the mess we had made in her room(She was kind of suspicious but we had take positions that were not out of the ordinary).As we were cleaning the younger of the cousins came over to me and told me kiss her.I told her no then the older cousin told her to go clean elsewhere.That basically sums it up but I do completely believe she would have gone farther if my cousin hadn't come in.

So here is the main point of my post,I have never told my parent only a few of my close friends.Also I have ever talked to my sister or that cousin about those events even though I have seen her many a times.Over the years with as I have noticed the mental effects of suppressing that memory.From what I can tell I have issues of generalized anxiety,social anxiety,and mental instability.Growing up it was rough and I had force myself to do a lot things that others can do naturally,at times this included emotions.And with age I have realized while my parents would get upset with me and it lies within my mental state,along with other matters.But due to my age in order for my to get the necessary assistance I would have to tell my parents.This is not so much the issue,the problem is I have no intention of exposing that cousin cause I feel as though she doesn't deserve harm terrible treatment.As well I feel as though I should maybe talk to my sister about the event prior to telling parents.I know she has dealt with suicidal thoughts and feel as though there may be a connection.

I need advice on the matter and the actions I should especially with the whole COVID-19 on going.",14Apr2020,1
217,"first time posting:

i'm an MSW grad student on full scholarship that got withdrawn out of her program recently, right before the pandemic. i've got an A average but the Faculty of Graduate Studies culled me along with 1000s of other students, because i had two Fs on my transcripts....not because i was a shitty student, but because i didn't submit final assignments. why?

since last summer where i was completing a 1000 hours of my placement straight, my dad got sick. he's recovered and he moved back to Canada permanently. and my home is seemingly whole again. but i burnt out. i lost my dog last october who had been with my family for 14 years. after getting into tech last year, i want to continue to have a career in it. i was told school would only slow me down.

**it's been hard waking up everyday, trying to get through the door, finish my classes, advocate for myself.**

&gt;there's a lot going on right now in the world. as an MSW student we are made painfully aware of it, aware of people's pain and their struggles against the system, of how challenging life is for people from so many difficult walks of life. i've lived with this for a long time. having my worldview shaken, and transformed, and going through the process of breaking rose-coloured glasses time and time again. 

before this pandemic, things were hard. and now, i'm safe at home with a family that is working still. my dad and brother work for grocery stores. my mum's a professor whose whole teaching load got moved online for 5 colleges and universities. my sister's a really successful photojournalist out of province. and then there's me. ~~i made my money as a tour-guide, working non-stop through my summers and school year. i used to be a really proactive person, with an infectious drive and passion for life. but that's gone.~~

i am in so much **pain**. but i'm still attached to responsibility. i still have to function in my home. my family is mad understanding. but i can't share everything with them. i have final papers i am so late on. but my profs are mad supportive. but i feel like i can't write. like there's something stuck in my chest. and i have a great therapist, but i don't feel like i have all the space in the world to be open with her with everything going on.

&gt;before the pandemic, i planned to return to the middle east, visit my best friend, and go back to india for the first time in 7 years. i needed a break. i needed to not be a student, a worker, a family member. 

i just wanted some *time and space to escape*. and i dream of it today. i just wish i had the money and the ability to fly somewhere, surrounded by nature in a small town. where all i needed to focus on is whatever my spirit needs to **heal**. i feel a deep sense of **loss**, and that the pandemic has just frozen my state in time. i am working hard to overcome this, to learn how to give myself to the world again, to return to the leadership and excellence i used to exude before this time.

218,"i dont really know where to post this. so i thought here would be the best place.

ill get straight to the point i guess. i think im being abused but a part of me thinks im just over reacting as well.

ive had severe anxiety and depression to the point i havent left my house in years and i think it was caused by my family. they were never physically abusive, or not a lot at least. but my mum would often call me names, belittle me, and generally just treat me different from how she treats my sibling.

at first i thought maybe it was just because i was older but it is still happening even though we are now both adults.

she has depression herself and i get that it can change how someone acts but she is constantly telling me its my fault and that if she kills herself it will be because of me were as she tells my brother that he is the one reason she hasnt. when i try to tell someone she turns it on me and denies everything saying im putting words in her mouth.

recently me and my sibling got into an argument because i opened the door and accidentally hit them to which they decided to kick me and hit me, right in front of my mum.

when i brought this up to her and practically broke down in front of her she says she didnt know it had happened but there wasn't anything she could do about it because she is 'sick' and 'doesnt want to get involved'.

neither of them have spoken to me in days, they just refuse to acknowledge im there. i have no friends i can talk to and with everything thats going on i cant even go to work and speak to people there. the only thing i have is my cat and at this point i guess im just really lonely.

222,"Trigger warning: Sexual abuse

I am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse/incest and naturally- my first sexual relationship was an abusive one. I was 14- too young, but very much blinded by the whole “first love/boyfriend” thing. Over a decade later, I decided to go to therapy to finally sort through my past. It wasn’t until then that I realized that I was also repeatedly abused by my first “love”. Up until recently, I didn’t (for whatever illogical reason) understand that your significant other could rape you, and that it was still considered rape if I ended up not fighting back and accepting it. I definitely had the “fawn” response. 
Anyways- ‘D’ is what I will call him, just because I am not sure if I am okay with releasing the name just yet- because he is well known and he is local and he does have a lot of friends, along with a family at this point. 

But- I now know that he abused me. He raped me. It’s hard to say even now. I’m going to put another trigger warning here just because I personally think it is important for me and for whoever chooses to read this- to know the full details. 

Throughout the year or so that I was with him- (as a fourteen year old freshman in high school)- he repeatedly manipulated and abused me. I thought it was okay and normal and somewhat my fault. All of these things I am about to describe happened many, many times. Almost ever single time I was with him.

He would take me outside, under a bridge in his neighborhood. (Sketchy AF) He would beg me to suck his dick, or to have sex with him, whatever. Doesn’t matter. But I would always initially say no, that I was scared of being caught, that I didn’t want to, etc. I would cry every time- begging him to not try to convince me to do this. But- I was blinded by first love, and blinded by being abused as a child- so I “fawned” and eventually accepted- crying the entire fucking time, every time. He would convince me to do these things by telling me that he would leave me and hate me if I did not do this, that I didn’t love him if I didn’t agree to do these things, that his other “girlfriends” did these things and that I was being prude. I didn’t want to lose him. I always did it. 

He would take me to a field by his house, where the owners would put up signs that said “will shoot if trespassing”. We had  climb under an electric fence, walk through tall ass grass, and cows and bulls were definitely in the distance. Along with houses and possibly people. He would constantly drag me there, as I cried because I was scared of getting shot or in trouble or hurt. He would lay down in the grass on these people’s property and tell me to have sex with him. Often trying to get me to take off my clothes as well. I again, would say no and please don’t and cry the whole time once I finally submitted. He would do similar things in different locations. Any time and any location he could, no matter where we were. I used to catch the bus at his house in  morning for school. While we were waiting for it, he would get me to suck his dick behind his parent’s truck, in front of there house, while the bus full of kids could pull up at any moment. Again, I cried, begged, and eventually submitted. 

The scariest and most visceral memory I have of him, though- was when he almost suffocated me. He convinced me to have sex with him in his room while his parents were home. I was scared as usual, didn’t want to do it as usual, but did it as usual anyways. But this time, he put his hands over my face, covering my nose and mouth. I couldn’t breathe. At all. This was the only time in my life (and still is) that I experienced the feeling of true physical helplessness of what felt like someone was trying to kill me. I was kicking and trying to scream stop, crying my ass of, thinking he was literally going to kill me as I slowly started to lose my vision from not being able to breathe. He was hysterically laughing the entire time and clearly saw that I hated the shit out of this and that I was fighting back. HE was on top of me, and was much stronger. I felt so helpless- similarly to how I felt as a toddler whenever my grandfather would hold me down and rape me. I hated myself for being in this situation again and I hated myself because I legit thought that was how I was going to die. He stopped as soon as I thought I was going to finally pass out. He was laughing his ass off- I was crying harder than I think I ever have. I didn’t understand how someone who “loved” me clearly saw I was in pain and yet continued to harm me. I didn’t understand why I let it happened, why I stayed. Why I still loved him. After he let up, he was laughing and told me that I was overreacting and that he was just kidding and that it was fine. I started
 To doubt my own feelings and experience. 

There was another situation where we were having sex and he ended up making me bleed. I freaked out and cried and he told me to “settle down” and that it was “ok” and that it was “nothing”. 

The feeling of constantly being so afraid that I was going to be caught was something that was very familiar for me from my childhood experience with rape. I didn’t realize it at the time, but it really fucked with me. I can’t even begin to tell you. There are so many more stories about this person and I- but at this point- I think you get it. 

He has a family now, and I am hopeful that he grew up and never did this again to anyone else. He was only 16 at the time- and I know a lot of the times, kids don’t understand what abuse is- especially if they were abused themselves. I think it is important for me to share this now, because it’s important for my journey, and it’s important  for the public to understand the grey areas of rape. Any unwanted sexual act- even if it eventually was accepted- even if it is your partner- even if a decade has gone by since you admitted it- IT WAS STILL RAPE. IT WAS STILL ABUSE. IT WAS AND STILL IS WRONG. My intentions of sharing this is not to get revenge on him or to inflict pain. It is to inform, and it is to heal.",14Apr2020,9
223," I (16f) am the therapist friend in my group and to everyone around me pretty much, and I'm aware of that fact. I have been for a while, and don't get me wrong; I don't necessarily want to change that. I enjoy being someone people can talk to and be around easily. I'm a naturally social, extroverted person; I've had a few minor issues with mental health in the past, but nothing serious or threatening, and I'm in a good place mentally at the moment. I've even had three instances of official mental health training from police and mental health services as a mentor and student counsellor in my school.

I'm still currently in school, and I've moved friendship groups quite drastically this school year - I know, petty friendship issues, but it is relevant. I never used to be the therapist group, I was more the joker, but how I moved into the new group was by being the outsider people could trust with their secrets and talk to, because I posed no threat to telling anyone. That sounds horrid, but I created that willingly, I'm happily integrated now, but I carry a lot of past and ongoing secrets on my shoulders, and being in this day and age it's a lot more instances of anxiety, depression and (not sure if i should add some trigger warning here) self harm. There's around 5 or 6 people that have talked to me about this things, each individually. Most of their parents are aware but other friends and even best friends aren't. I'm really close with a lot of these people, but oddly (I guess) my best friend I recently made in this new group is the one that struggles the least, and not included in those 6 - she's the cool and chill friend that we all know.

I know this is long, and if you're still reading I appreciate it a lot as I really would love some advice.

Anyway, specifically for this question I'm going to talk about my friend May (16f). May has a bad home life to put it briefly. May has struggled with depression for a while and at least one instance of (tw) self harm, if not more. May's parents are always arguing and talk about divorcing a lot. May has a younger brother (he's 11 i think) and they aren't close so he isn't a help. May's relationship with her father is awful - they hardly talk and when they do they just argue, to a worrying point. May's relationship with her mother isn't much better - her mum knows about the mental health things and attempts to help but is always arguing with May and her dad. May has even told me before she really wants to live with her grandparents or aunt who live about half an hour and 40 mins away from her home respectively. I only became close with May recently through a mutual friend (about December) but she's really opened up. The mutual friend is my chill best friend and they're also best friends, possibly closer.

Now, a few nights ago May let me know she was crying and upset. She's really struggled with the quarantine due to the home life, but the way she was talking I knew something was wrong. She told me she was just missing people but I suspect there was more to it. She started using language like ""I can't live"", ""I won't make it through this"", ""I can't go on"" etc so my mind went in to 'you need to stay safe and tell me if you harm yourself' mode. Long story short, me and the mutual bestie (16f) talked her down of whatever was happening; we didn't know whether she posed a threat to herself or not, we just tried to do as much as we could. She went to sleep seemingly better, and me and the mutual best friend talked after about our concerns. She woke up fine and has been on edge since but nothing as bad.

This is just one example of a few I've had like this: staying up and feeling like I'm tugging with someone's life. The thing is, I'm starting to really feel these repercussions. My mind is almost constantly on edge of what I can do to help May and others and how they are, and how every word I say to them could make a massive difference or be the last. And even my friends that don't have issues AS serious as these, not to invalidate them, I find my thoughts orientating around others and their often-fragile-seeming life status, and I'm worried it could take some sort of toll on me. 

I don't want to be selfish, and I don't want to distance myself or push away these friends that I feel often need me because I'm scared of what could happen or what they could do to themselves, however I'm struggling with the repercussions and thoughts following these incidents to the point that I feel I'm juggling a bunch of other peoples' lives all except my own. Am I being selfish? Do I need to change my attitude or my ways? Any guidance or help would be so appreciated.",14Apr2020,1

233,"They're saying it could be 12-18 months before life can go back to normal, and I genuinely don't think I could handle it.

Because of surgeries I've had, and a couple legal things, I haven't been able to truly live my life for the past year. Now, I'm going to be stuck inside my house for another year to a year and a half?!?!

Seriously, what's the point in having a life if you can't live it? Before all this started, I had great plans to turn everything around. I was gonna go through school so I could get a nice job, I was gonna start spending more time with friends, I was gonna start meeting more people, I was genuinely gonna start living the way I wanted, but this virus fucked that up.

It seems like Everytime I get to a high point, I get knocked back down lower than I was before. I get that life isn't fair, but the bad outweighs the good by such an incredibly large margin, I don't think it's worth continuing.

And I get that everyone else is in this too, but still. Saying I'm not the only one suffering is like telling someone who's house burned down that it's okay because it's happened to other people too. That doesn't make things any better for me.

I don't think I can take it much longer. I don't wanna even try to sometimes.",14Apr2020,2
234,"I’ve gone through some crappy things in life like a mentally and emotionally abusive mom, my dad who I was the closest to got an alcoholic druggy girlfriend who made me the bad guy in his eyes so she gets all the attention, my oldest sister is 14 years older than me and resented me my whole life, and my other 2 sisters who lived in the house picked up on my moms abusive behavior and took every chance they got to belittle me and put me down giving me the lowest self esteem and confidence possible. Mental disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, borderline personality, depression, and anxiety all run in my family and I’ve been recently diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Because of all of this I feel like a sociopath who can’t make genuine human connections with people because my brain tells me they hate me or I don’t know the right thing to say or do. Everything around other people feels like they don’t really like me or want to be around me. My (ex?) best friend is closer to other people now and never texts or calls me back, plus she and my other friends are all closer to my husband so I always feel like an annoying 3rd wheel with the group and they only put up with me for my husband. It feels like the coworkers who I socialize with really only do it because they feel sorry for me, and my family talks to me because they’re family and they have to even though they put me through hell as a kid and still try to make me feel small. I always feel like an outsider no matter what situation I’m in. I can’t even feel comfortable with my in laws who are normal, kind, accepting people who actually do care about me because I feel like there’s a barrier up and I’m not part of “their” family. My husband is the only person in my life who I am certain actually loves me. But he doesn’t understand because he’s never gone through anything like this and doesn’t know depression and anxiety, which I am thankful for, but it also means I feel like I don’t have anyone to talk to. I tried therapy but I haven’t found the right therapist yet and now everything is shut down due to COVID. So long post, and if you’re still with me, thank you. But I’m wondering if anyone out there has felt anything like this and knows advice on how to make it stop because I feel like I’m not living MY life, I’m just an unwanted guest in someone else’s.",14Apr2020,1
235,"Hello everyone, I'm 20. I'm diagnosed with PTSD (I believe CPTSD) and generalized anxiety disorder. I grew up in a very neglected state, and was homeless for 6 years until last September. Life has finally taken an upswing, and I'm housed, in school, have a relationship etc (I never went to school as a child). My girlfriend has had her own battles with depression, and seeing her improve from medication and other things gave me the courage to start taking meds and go to therapy. I was raised by my mentally ill and narcissistic mother, and I have some concerns I'd like to ask for input on. Sometimes I feel like certain requests and preferences aren't respected by my girlfriend, and I understand why, but I need help with bringing up my issues and triggers with her in a way she won't feel I'm being demanding or controlling. I am also worried that I have modeled some things from my mother and have some unhealthy expectations in my relationship. I've been taking Wellbutrin for the past 2 months, and it helps somewhat, but I think I'm going to speak to my provider and switch to a different antidepressant. You're welcome to ask me whatever you want, thank you for any input.",14Apr2020,2

238,"I don't know if anybody will see this, but one's thing for sure. I'm writing this post to my self.

So let me just spill everything that's in my mind. I'm in quarantine for so long now. Getting off school and not trying to be ""perfect student"". I tried getting into a plan of special kids that start their academic degree in high school. Looking back at it I'm pretty sure I did it only to get away from life. From my toxic friends, my judging family. And most importantly, my suecidal thoughts. 
All In a stupid attempt to finish this part of life and move onward before everyone else.

I was also a part of a robotics team. And man I'm telling you it is stressful. They expect you to stay and work there for 8 hours a day. After school of course. Even if you don't have anything to contribute you have to stay out you're ""not part of the team"". Of course not everyone there is like that but the ones that make the decisions are...
Anyway I finally had a good reason to go home and study. I tried keeping the special students program my own little secret. But it didn't take long for my friends to find out about it. And it all became a stupid competition. They were all laughing at me for studying for the ""IQ"" test. And in the end, we all got our answers, after 2 weeks of studying they both passed, while I failed. And then, suddenly my you know what thoughts came back after a while of feeling great. I imagined them laughing over my stupid ass for studying and not passing. I imagined my teammates being angry at me for bailing on them a couple of days before the competition. 
And lucky for me. And unfortunately for other people, the Covid-19 pandemic begun and everything got cancelled. 

So after a few days of getting the results of the test, everyone were kind of disappointed of me because I kinda hyped up this test. But I got over it. And I felt kinda good, because I was In quarantine and I had nothing to worry about. 
But than, I remembered, there was another special students program that I can go to. I really want to start my academic studies early. The 2nd program is much easier to get into and I can choose which courses I want to go to. I kinda got all hyped up about it and than I started signing all the forms I needed, choosing all the courses I want to go to and fantasizing about the future. And than, out of nowhere, it all came back to me. All the depression and loneliness, the disappointment I will have after not passing some courses.

And then, a random question popped into my head. What if I will just be normal? What if I stop trying to be smarter then everyone else in my age for just one time and stop being afraid of it so much?

Anywho, here I'm lying in bad and writing all of this to you. Thanks for helping.......


DISCLAIMER: I have talked to my parents and I'm going to see a psychologist after quarantine. They think I'm over reacting to puberty but I honestly believe I have some serious issues. I think after a few talks with the phycologist he will send me to a psychiatrist.",14Apr2020,5

240,"The Covid-19 virus has had me on edge. My step daughter and her boyfriend have had the virus. I work as a security guard and feel that I am not protected at my job even though I am listed as an essential worker. My wife has type 2 diabetes which puts her at a greater risk of infection.

I drove Uber to make ends meet but with everything closed that is not practical. I have had to not pay some utilities to get by and have been shorted hours at work because some sites have closed down, hotels and libraries. I know that the stimulus money will help, but for how long?

I know things are not going to get back to normal, at least not the previous definition of normal, for a while. I just wonder if that normal is going to be something I can handle.",14Apr2020,2

244,"I suffer from extreme anxiety disorder and depression, I had PANDAS when I was a kid and I am 20 and go through the residual effects of the disorder. When I’m alone I dance around and I scream and act out a lot and make funny faces and my movements and speech are sporadic. I have done this since I was a kid. I am a pretty normal person when I’m around people I’m comfortable with, I’m deemed the funny one and someone you can talk to and have intelligent conversations with if you want to just relax from acting like idiots with your friends. I hate mirrors and I think the reflection is a lie sometimes and I get scared when I wake up half awake (I have closet door mirrors.) I lucid dream almost 90% of the time and I can feel all of the pain in the lucid dreams I don’t know if that’s normal but the pain is brief and I wake up just fine, I can remember my dreams a lot too. I don’t want to work outside of my home and it’s hard for me to find a job to work from home at, I can’t find any and it’s frustrating when someone tells me that they work from home and I just don’t want to leave my house.

245,"I dont feel connected or related to my reality. It's like my consciousness is sat on a recliner watching my body and mind go through the motions of my daily life, like you would watch a character on a tv show.
Every day I come home, and it's like I drop every aspect of my personality. I binge watch movies and tv shows and listen to hundreds of different albums, but nothing sticks. Nothing stirs an emotional connection. I feel completely disconnected when I'm alone, even though I'm in contact with people whenever I am. 
Do I have a personality? I can't remember that last time I found something or heard or saw something that made me feel an emotion that I connected with. I feel like my perception is wrapped in a safety blanket and bubble wrap. I'm aware of everything that goes on, have perfect recall and clarity on my words and actions and know what feelings I'm experiencing, but it's like I'm watching it through a window or on a TV. It doesnt seem real. Nothing positive gets through and all I feel is disgust, pity and loss and what I feel like I'm losing. I know I should change, and that I have friends and family who love me and want to see me grow and succeed, but I cant find the motivation to actually take care of myself. 
I dont know if I want to exist. I'm not suicidal (anymore) but I wake up every day and look at myself and feel like I'm losing grip of what makes me unique with every passing day and I always ask myself if it's worth it.
Can anyone explain to me what this is and how to cope with it, because all i want to do is force my friends away and isolate and completely lose myself because I don't see any value in what little emotion or connection I have left to the world",14Apr2020,10
246,"so i'm 5""3 and 242 lbs,and i hate myself.Next fall i'm going to college and i don't want to be that fat,but i don't know what to do.
the thing is i'm not well with my mental health and i like to eat because it makes me feel good,it's the only thing that gives me real joy anymore.And if i'm happy i still want to eat to make the moment last longer.I've been fat shamed by whole life,i was like 7 kgs away from my ideal weight 3 1/2 years ago,and that was because i was crying a lot and i didn't want to eat anything.
The fact is that i don't want to give my parents or the other people who bullied me the satisfaction of me losing weight,like they won,but i don't want to be bullied anymore.My parents bully me about that 24/7,at school i'm bullied,once someone hacked into my facebook account and posted saying ""i'm fat and chubby"",so i didn't went to school for 2 days.
i hate people so much.Why it's so important to them that i'm a littme chubbier?why can't they shut up?The world is full of assh*les who don't think about what they are saying.After all is you're skinny or fat you will die anyway,being skinny doesn't stop that",14Apr2020,5
247,"I've struggled with my mental health for more than a decade. I was told it would likely get better. It only got worse during that time. Medicine never seemed to do much for me, but I take it anyway. The worst bouts of my depression are cyclical. I'll feel fine for a good while, and then it'll hit me like a truck for weeks, possibly months. The semester was set to end early may. I had an A in the class. But then I was hit with my severe depressive episode. I could not get it together. 1 week... then 2 weeks of missing assignments. I talked with my instructor... they said that I could either do the work and show up or withdraw from the class. To be fair, I feel that he did his best to help me while maintaining the integrity of his class. But the fact still stood that I couldn't even shower or take a step outside or even do anything I enjoyed like play a video game or watch Youtube. So I withdrew... I'm simultaneously relieved not to have it hanging over my head anymore and extremely disappointed in myself. I don't know if I'm ever going to return to college. I'm still in debt for this class too. I'm living on SSI right now, which honestly has improved my life since I got it, and will allow me not to be completely devastated by the student loan. I'm grateful to have it. I don't know what kind of life awaits me. I'm 23, and time just seems to zoom by. I don't know if I can handle a job. I'm very socially anxious, very self concious and self hating, and when the depressive episode hits, I'm 100% useless for an extended period of time.  I'm good at art... drawing, writing... I'm even working on game design. I wrote a novella late last year and sold it on amazon but didn't make much, I didn't have much for marketing. I guess I'm just going to persue a commission based income with art and other creative things I could possibly come up with... Etsy maybe? I don't know... All I know is that I feel sad, and disappointed. Guilty as well. Always very guilty. But I did learn that the traditional route of college, and standard job just isn't going to work for me. I really don't want to have to be on SSI forever, but a good start may just be honing my craft and selling my services online.  If you've read this, thank you. I don't really know anyone I can talk to right now. I just needed to tell somebody.",14Apr2020,3
