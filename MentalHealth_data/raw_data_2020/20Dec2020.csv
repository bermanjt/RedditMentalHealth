0,"tw suicide mentions 

im gonna try to make this as short as i can. 

so basically this year has sucked ass. lost most of my friends and my boyfriend broke up with me. i was already very depressed but it only got way worse. i have no motivation to do anything, lately i just stare at the ceiling and scroll on twitter and that's it. my life is boring and unfulfilling, i have no friends irl and i hate myself so much i wanna rip my skin off my body (i'm a trans guy which doesn't help). i'm feeling very suicidal and anxious, normally i would reach out to my best friend because she's the person i trust the most but she's also going through it and needs a break so we haven't talked much lately. i miss her so much, and i'm worried about her but i can't do anything about it. i feel like no one cares about me, and like i'm just a burden to everyone. i really need to talk to someone but as i said my only option is unavailable and i don't know what to do. i'm also scared that my best friend just got tired of me and hates me so she said she needed a break because of me. 

i'm only 15 and i feel like im loosing my teenage years to depression. 

i have already posted on this subreddit but got no comments so i'm trying with something shorter this time because i really need advice, or at least i need someone to tell me that killing myself is not worth it.",20Dec2020,1

7,"Hi everyone, this is my first post here but I don't really know where else to post this. Anyway I've noticed in the past yearish or so all my old memories are fading and the ones I do have don't even feel like me. I feel like a spectator in someone else's body to the point where I can't connect feelings to those moments. The same goes with memories as soon as like 1-3 years ago and memories with other people, I just don't feel a connection with myself and what happened in the moment. It worries me especially with other people because there will be a moment we had together that I have no emotional connection to it's just like it happened and went on. If I see a picture or moment I don't feel like I ever experienced it, like I know cognitively I was there I wouldn't have these memories if I wasn't but I can't feel anything about them I don't really know how to explain it. Same goes with friendships, I know I should have this connection with them and I have memories with these people yet when I'm with them I can't seem to find what I'm supposed to feel giving a really bad habit of just forgetting that they exist and I have to stay in contact all together. I already know I have pretty bad general anxiety and social anxiety but this I've only started to notice recently. I've tried googling it but nothing really comes up so that's why I'm posting here, I don't really know what to do",20Dec2020,1
8,"I (22F) have been through a lot this year, more than anyone can imagine and trauma I don't want to share because I am not comfortable sharing it yet. That and then straight into lockdowns. 

My mother who's obviously depressed as fuck and won't do anything about it (I have begged), is driving me insane to the point I'm questioning whether I am even happy being in my family. She hasn't been sleeping in the same bed as my father for about a year now, they argue all the time, and I literally can see why because my mum's just so negative and will go nuts 100% to anything. 

She's vulnerable with her COPD and won't let you forget it, she expects us to do every single thing for her and if we don't', were disgusting, horrible people. She won't leave the house and uses the shielding as an excuse, but she'll also sneak to the shop to buy and hide whiskey in her room. I'm so over it. 

She bitches about every single thing; the next door's doing something - slags them off to me, Co-worker (Who was a close family friend at one point) does something (She works online)- Calls them horrible shit to me. These could be things that shes hyper-analysed. I'll come up to her to hang out for a bit, but all she'll do is read something depressing off the news and then complain if I seem 'not to care'.

I'm on medication for my trauma, and I started specialist therapy. I am home from Uni, and we have just gone into another lockdown. I really don't know how I'm going to cope anymore. I really love my mum and feel so sorry for her, but it's all emotionally draining with her, and I'm starting to avoid her whenever I can. 

Tonight she was complaining about how she's treated like shit at work, and I said very kindly, I'm sorry you're experiencing that but other than doing something about it, you're just going to make yourself ill. Suddenly I'm a shit person, and all I want to talk about is me. I didn't even reply because I'm so exhausted from her, she carried on making me feel like shit, and then I told her to stop and google emotional incest, and I left the room. 

She came downstairs after googling it and had a go again saying that it's for children and I'm 22 years old and I should listen if I want to get treated like an adult. 

Honestly, if this is what adulting is all about then fuck this. 

I wish she'd reach out to other people and not rely on offloading everything on to me. She knows about my year, and what I'm going through, I wish she'd talk to dad about it, but I know it's because he offers solutions she doesn't like, and all she wants to do is bitch. 

Sorry for the rant. I needed to get my head together. 

Can someone suggest ways I can go about in trying to encourage her to get help? Like she's the same with my dad, and I honestly fear one-day I'm going to wake up to the news that he's topped himself.",20Dec2020,1
9,"I am 27 and have been dealing with extreme depression for the last couple of years. I am a military veteran and a survivor of child abuse, so I suffer from diagnosed PTSD. I hadn’t always been a depressed person, actually quite the opposite. But as of lately, my depression has only gotten worse. 

I am currently in a JD/MBA program in NYC and I have been feeling like I’ve been going crazy since I started my program. My wife and I recently had our first child, but I haven’t even been able to enjoy him because I am literally glued to my bed and sunken in despair. 

I have gotten therapy every Friday since May, but it hasn’t helped tremendously. I have used drugs in the past recreationally, and that would usually make me feel at peace with myself and the world, but now whenever I try them, they either make me feel worse or do nothing at all. I feel like I have tried everything at this point; I meditate everyday, I read the entire Bible, I read other spiritual texts to find a silver lining to my situation, I exercise 3-4 times a week, nothing is working and it’s just scaring the hell out of me. I recently have been so depressed that it is driving my wife away from me because she has been trying to comfort me during this time and it has just been exhausting for her, especially with our kid in the picture. 

I feel like most of this feeling is from being estranged from my parents as well as the mental exhaustion from my school program. I am not interested in rekindling a relationship with them because every time I talk to them, they tell me how I’m a horrible person and how they didn’t abuse me as a child. I honestly just want to graduate so I can provide from my family and not feel like this worthless slump that is bringing everyone down. Does anyone have any tips?",20Dec2020,1

The lights were so bright raining down on me with the intensity of a tornado. Seth struggled to make conversation with me while I alternated between sitting and standing in my hospital bed. I associated everyone with someone. The nusrse was my second mom, Tina, Everything is fuzzy but I remember test after test and the confusion of all the wires and and why I couldn’t go to the bathroom without supervision. Seth was in the middle of fraternity duties and some finals so as a distraction he let me watch Lois CK on his laptop. Louis was talking to me directly he spoke through the laptop, jumping off the screen it was live and I was his focus. Everything pertained to me. As I went rolling from the waiting room to the room in a wheel chair I heard “think about her Grandmother”, What about her Grandmother” “she died and your selfish”. Waiting in the chaos I had no concept of what I was doing there. For me I was higher than the stars. Well, to be accurate, I ran the gammit of emotions. Myhirled like an eddy, epihany after epiphany. I was on top of the world yet so low at the same time.  

Then a shot and I was out. I woke up alone in a cold dark room and suddenly the highs had all dissolved into lows. Where was I? What did I do wrond?",20Dec2020,1
11,"I’m scared but I’m also tired of suffering

(18f) I’ve had a really awful couple of months. Along with GAD, I have an extreme case of emetophobia (fear of vomiting) thats been a part of my life for as long as i can remember but recently has become completely debilitating. I had an incident 2 months ago where i woke up and had a panic attack that caused me to dry heave. Since then I’ve been nauseous every day with no breaks, which is torture because of the phobia. I never see my friends, my relationship fell apart, i can’t eat more than oatmeal, crackers, and peanut butter, and can barely make myself shower once a week. I’ve been having ~2 panic attacks a day and and I’m so tired. The sick feeling is never the same as the day before and I’m constantly terrified. It’s not a physical problem, as I’ve done multiple tests and my GI system is healthy. I’ve been trying new anxiety and panic meds which do nothing, zofran (antiemetic meant for chemo patients) only works about half the time. I can’t do this anymore. I’ve never felt closer to suicide than i do right now but i don’t really want to die i just need this feeling to end. I’m supposed to start a partial hospitalization program soon but it’s 10 weeks away and it doesn’t feel like enough. I haven’t really told my therapist about the suicidal idealation because i live with my parents and don’t want them to hear. After doing some research i found that the program i found for php also has a residential program for ocd/anxiety thats well regarded and is usually successful. I think it could help me but I’m scared to have to call and tell the nurse that i think i need more care. I’m also scared of having to face all of this shit and I’m scared of going through treatment just to have things stay the same. Any advice or words of encouragement are appreciated.

12,"Hey guys! First time posting here on this sub and I hope to get some proper motivation and takeaways from any possible responses.

So, to make a long story short, I received my first major panic attack last week. On Wednesday night. Never had one. Felt immensely great before that, enjoying my year as troubling as it was due to the current scene. What I thought to be a heart attack, since it was on the left side of the chest and arm, was actually not that. After the ER ran numerous tests that is, and found no blockage of the heart or anything to signify a heart issue. Healthy. After that, that very same night I went back home and felt great. Relieved. Slept well. Only to then feel continuous anxiety throughout the day. Went back to the ER, felt instantly better after speaking to a nurse. Seems like all I needed was to vent all the stuff I've gone through my life up until that point. Nothing traumatic. Except a very stressful family life.

The day after, I went to speak to a therapist. And since then, my path towards recovery has begun. Since the weekend that passed, a few days ago, I have felt better by the day with my anxiety. It was faintly there until I no longer feel it completely. Not a single hint of heaviness in the chest or fear. Nada. Which in hindsight, is a very good thing. 

Only it's now replaced with an apathetic feeling sometimes. Which is weirdly as unfortunate. Since Wednesday, I have been feeling really bored, tired and empty. I've noticed I feel way better during the morning times but after the sun goes down, I feel iffy. And at night? Bleh. But again, ""sometimes"". Thursday and yesterday, the Friday? I felt the same but just a tiny bit. Only for it to vanish when I was at work and I felt really damn good. As well as earlier today. Now, it could be due to yesterday night's beverage of a Gatorade ending in a night of barely any sleep but at the moment, I went from feeling glad to down to glad again only to feel down or apathetic. It sucks. But it could be just me being exhausted.

I've also been taking medication for my anxiety that the therapist said doesn't seem like I need but gave the option nevertheless for. I accepted it just in case. And I just started taking it yesterday. It's Zoloft to be exact. Although I have felt good without it, I said: ""Fuck it, why not try to see if it works""?

So, I ask, is this normal? Has it happened to anyone else? For my anxiety to slowly disappear only to turn into apathy or a mild depressive feeling? Could it be due to my body distressing itself and kinda returning back to the motions? During the winter time, years beforehand, I vaguely remember feeling somewhat less energetic compared to other seasons but I still enjoyed my hobbies. it seems it really hit me this year because now I don't even enjoy games. And is it because of well, the winter time? Or the meds, perhaps as a side effect? Sorry for asking so many questions. This is a new experience for me so anything helps! Thank you!",20Dec2020,1
13,"A few months ago I was desperate to have friends and cling to the ones I already have. I was so scared to be lonely. If ever I didn’t have plans on a Friday night I felt like a failure and would instantly badly of myself. It’s as if I was seeking validation from others. 

Now I enjoy my own company and I have realized that I don’t need anyone. Friends are nice to have but I absolutely don’t need them because I can so much fun on my own. It took me a whole pandemic and a national lockdown to finally make peace with my own company and truly love spending alone time.",20Dec2020,1
14,"Sometimes I’ll take a lot of Percocet’s, and I’ll wake up the next day, incredibly upset with myself for the person I’ve become. I’ll just recall a childhood memory, when I was little, when I didn’t need copious amounts of drugs to find happiness; and I’ll just start crying intensely. I don’t like to think about it too much, how I’ve let my mom down, or destroyed my health with eating disorders, or the self-harm scars I have. It’s not something anybody knows about though, I’m an excessively private person, to the point where nobody suspects anything may be wrong. That’s the way I prefer things to be, I don’t want to let anybody down, or feel like they were never caring enough — or blame themselves for what’s inevitable. I really don’t enjoy being bipolar, because it distances me from the willpower that I used to be able to identify myself with. It’s all-consuming, and no amount of willpower can prevent me from spiraling further into my severely oppressive episodes of depression. Ever since July, every day has been worse than the last, but it’s not always immediately apparent. I’ll have a few days where things are tolerable, not realizing that I’ve subconsciously been manifesting my trauma during that time. Then, I’ll have a few days where my emotions become an uncontrollable force of nature, and I can’t do anything but surrender to their wrath. Usually surrendering means filling myself up with enough drugs and liquor to forget about any such world that exists outside of that very moment. I wish I knew how to be better, but there’s nothing I can do, since I can’t receive mental health treatment. I’m going to fail out of high school, but it’s extremely difficult to keep up with schoolwork when every second of my day is spent trying to coerces myself out of suicide. Nobody knows that’s why I’m fucking up though, I wish I could take a break to figure things out, but I can’t. Drugs are that break for me, even if they don’t solve the problem, they cease the unnerving cries of responsibility that serve to validate my own inertia. Maybe one of you will have advice on what to do, I certainly hope so, but perhaps I’m too much of a lost cause given my circumstances. Thank you for reading, you’re a kind person for reading a mentally unstable junkie complain on the internet.",20Dec2020,1

Crawling on my hands and knees around the aprtment looking for my cat. It was 8am, I had been up all night and I knew something was wrong. I felt disconnected, like I was outside of myself looking in. I called into work, they called me in anyway. At work everything was a blur, I apparently shredded a bunch of papers and threw a clipboard. I was sent home. Two to three days later With no sleep and no contact with my family and friends, people grew concerned. My friend came to check on me and quickly called my brother to drive up from richmond. I hadn’t eaten, the apartment was trashed and I had burried my phone in box so the government couldn’t track me. I was taken to the ER and after observation and a shot of Haldol, taken to a nearby hospital in Maryland. I stayed for two weeks and slowly came out of psychosis. I was fired and the depression that followed was crippling. I lost myself completely, I couldn’t eat without feeling like the motions were foreign. I walked differently, stiff with a shuffle. I talked in a monotone dribble. I was numb, void of personality. I was miserable.  

That was my first psychotic break. After that I came home to live with my parents. I got a job, worked for two years, things were ok but that vital piece of myself was missing. I was hollow. No emotion flat and I knew things would never be the same. I had my second break I was up for days with racing thoughts and I decided that the thooughts needed to end , I overdosed, went to the hospital and was admitted to a facility in West Virginia. After that it seemed like I could only hold a job for 2 years before having yet another break. My symptoms at work consisied of extreme paranoia and anxiety. I felt exposed, I was on display and I felt like everyone knew my struggles.  

I’ve been hospitalized 9 times and each one took a part of me away. In 2019, I spent 6 months out of the year in hospitals and I wasn’t sure I was going to make it. I’ve been in seclusion and restraints. I was assaulted and I spent the other part of the year starving myself because I was so depressed I didn’t think I was worthy of food. I heard voices and had persecutary delusions and even believed I was God.  

Over the years i’ve been on various antipsychotics, mood stabilizers and antidepressants. I’ve had side effects such as weight gain letargy and tardive dyskenisia. I have attempted suicide and have been aggressive.  

All this led to profound guilt and shame.  

2020, though a strange year for the world, has been a year of recovery for me. I have been on a steady and good combination of medications. And I learned the importance of compliance. I see a psychaitrist, a therapist and I have peer support along with friends and family. I found that parts that had been missing and slowly put the pieces back together. I have scars but I am healing. I still hear voices but i’ve learned to better cope. I use mindfulness and I listen to music and the t.v. I use positive self talk every day and i’m working toward a balanced. Life.  

Schizzoaffective with depression or Bipolar is my diagnosis along with Attention Deficit Disorder. I still struggle and somedays are harder than others. However I have an important thing that was missing for years. I have hope.  

We all struggle differently. But we are strong. Resiliency is inside each one of us. We have the power to accept the reality and move forward with greater knowledge and understanding of our illneses. We are capaple of living happy and healthy lives, We are not our illnesses.",20Dec2020,1

17,"It’s been a hard year for majority of people. This year I lost my grandad, my dad cut me off  off bc my step mum is a manipulator and got my step sisters to block me online. So I won’t be going for Christmas, but I’ll be off to my brothers. Then there’s the stress of uni online. And 3 weeks ago my nearly 2 year long relationship with my boyfriend has ended. 

About 2/3 weeks ago I was so close to ending my life but I couldn’t do  it. I thought I was okay until we broke up, now I’m feeling the stress of the whole year at once. Grief and sadness.

He was my best friend. I left bc he didn’t know what he wanted and it made me feel not Good enough and He needed to be alone and figure stuff out. Even now he says he doesn’t know what he wants and there’s a part of him who would like for us to work out. I don’t know what to believe. He just knows he needs to be alone atm to sort himself out. I’m that person who convinces myself that he doesn’t care or love me but I know he probably does.  We’re still close I guess he stayed over twice this week as he went home for Christmas today. He tells me he loves me lots and misses me loads and He wants to see me after Christmas I think. But I don’t get why if we’re broken up. 

I’ve never felt this type of pain before. He was perfect in many ways we clicked so so well. the only downfall was that he wasn’t very emotional compared to me and so it caused problems as we had different love languages. I can’t help but think I won’t ever love anyone as much as I love him and I’m always going to compare people against him bc he is literally everything I’ve ever wanted. I’m crying nearly everyday and feel my heart racing and my body shaking. I’ve suffered with depression and anxiety but this feeling is new and I’m not sure how to cope with it and if I’ll ever be able to move on. Everything hurts and I’m scared bc I only saw him yesterday and I know as the days go on it’s going to get worse and I’m gonna feel more heartache and I’m worried.

“He was a narcissistic, sadistic, horrible person”

“He did everything out of love... maybe it’s his only way of showing it” 

“He controlled everything, he monitored everything, he was insane”

“He just wants to protect me” 

My thought pattern every time I think of my father. An endless back and forth argument about how he wasn’t such a terrible person, how he had good intentions. It pains me because I can’t tell what’s real and what’s not. My relationships/friendships are always the same, I can never fully understand what is real and what is not. Am I over analyzing? Maybe. Did they do something wrong I shouldn’t ignore? Yes, but maybe they didn’t mean it like that, there’s an explanation. It’s constant bickering in my head. 

The facts are my father was not an affectionate man in the verbal sense. I felt uncomfortable with how he always liked to cuddle or got angry if I didn’t kiss him on the lips. He called me names such as Twinkie and would pinch my thighs. He pulled a gun on my mother and me after hitting me as a very young toddler, when she said she should leave him for that. My phone had an app which tracked location, monitored texts and calls, could see every app downloaded, etc. My clothing was strictly limited. I was always yelled at for having “excessive amounts of makeup”, including an instance where I came downstairs while getting ready with a bare face and was told I had too much on, I looked ugly like a clown. He would tell me my acne would make me less attractive and no one wants to date that. I wasn’t allowed to go to a dance with a perfect, wonderful guy who I was all set to go with after telling them about him, then told him the name and he refused because of his race. I vividly remember how long “talks” lasting upwards of 4 hours consisted of yelling and slamming things and forcing me to stand there. Over the smallest things, not changing the litter box or taking out the trash. At one point, my stepmother was made to stand in the bathroom while I showered with a clear shower curtain and be with me while I dressed. I slept in my very young siblings room on a bunk bed so a baby monitor was trained on me. My mother wasn’t allowed to talk to me on the phone unless it was okayed by him, not taking any time away from his schedule. Having to sleep on a cot next to his bed. Being hit in the face because I lied about eating my breakfast before school. Forcing me to go to therapy just to sit in on my sessions and direct the whole thing around chores I wouldn’t do and why I didn’t do that. Coming home from work early after I got home from school because the cameras in the house showed me going to turn the light switch on, on the wrong side of the doorway, as I walked in, then telling me I’m on drugs and he’s taking me to the hospital. Screaming at me because he thought I was pregnant due to just feeling sick, then refusing to apologize when I calmly stated I was on my period. Getting in my face when his yelling eventually didn’t phase me anymore and wouldn’t make me cry. Not being allowed to cry. Forcing me to watch my siblings for hours on hours, while having to hear them have sex and nap, always constantly having to babysit them. Calling cops threatened when I finally hit my limit and told him to get out of my fucking face while cornered in the bathroom getting screamed at. Never being allowed to be anywhere but with them. Watching Jekyll and Hyde emerge when talking to CPS and other family/friends/etc as opposed to behind closed doors. Getting pressure points when he was angry to drop me to my knees. Not being allowed to read, draw, do sudoku, no electronics, writing, etc when I was grounded, just play with my siblings or sit. Getting woken up with screaming when I’d accidentally fall asleep and take a nap. When I was taking Seroquel as prescribed for insomnia, being woken up and forced to do chores as I can barely stand due to such a high dosage to get me to sleep. Passing out from standing in one spot so long while being screamed at. Any injuries or illnesses I was faking and wouldn’t be taken to the doctor. No birth control after a doctor told me it’s likely I’ll become anemic for how much blood I’m losing. No gyno appointments because it enables me to have sex. Being kicked out of his house after one therapy session in which the awful therapist (who after one session I got angry for her telling me I would never go to college and believing my father about how “horrible” my mother is, I overdosed that same night) asked if I felt safe with myself and I said no, I don’t feel comfortable in being around this environment and keeping myself safe. Trying to convince me that I did something I didn’t do. Constantly interrogating me to get me to catch myself in a lie. Reading my diary and having conversations about why my feelings shouldn’t be that way. 

Yet after all this, I still can’t accept that it happened. That maybe I’m lying to myself. I’m exaggerating. It’s all in my head. I’m scared to admit that it could be real, that I’m actually broken and have been traumatized. I start to think that maybe that’s why I am the way I am in relationships. But yet again maybe it’s not true. Maybe I’m just a bad person. 

Now, I don’t want pity from this. I’m just trying to figure things out. Am I imagining a horrible monster because I just didn’t like his parenting style? Am I even allowed to consider any of this as trauma? I know the facts are I have other side issues in which he was not involved that have caused trauma. But for some reason, I’m baffled in a maze of my own thoughts as to what the hell in actuality was my father being a good, protective father or was him showcasing bad parenting in which wasn’t healthy to me?

23,"I keep telling my therapist my eating isn’t an issue and worming out of her request for me to get a nutritionist but I’m almost underweight and I just fucking bought baby food because it’s low calorie (I really like crunchy food so those puff snacks are amazing tbh). I’m going to fully be back to where I was in high school/college and I’m unsure if I should tell her cause I kind of wanna keep losing weight :/ and maybe if I lose enough, that’ll be better than me killing myself.

24,"I'm at a loss right now. In my life i have only really found happiness in 3 things - My friends (including my siblings), video games, and making/listening to music. I would've also included my mother, but honestly i don't know. I have a hard time trying to say the worlds i love you to her anymore (if i even can).

As a young child I was disciplined by my mom, which i have no problem with, but now that i'm bigger and older (16), I can't be touched. Now it's all verbal and my mom says some really hurtful things sometimes that really screws with my brain. Every time she says something wrong or hurtful i really just want to explode and tell her what's what, but I can't. She could say the harshest stuff that makes me contemplate acting on the dark thoughts that enter my mind, but I think about how much it would hurt her, my family and my friends. 

The best way for me to get out of that dark place is to make music and play games, but whenever i play games, she sees it as me wasting my time. If i get up in the morning to play for a bit and talk with my friends, she'll use it as ammo to drive the knife deeper into my heart. School doesn't make it any easier too. I'm 16 and in my last year of high school. There's so much stress trying to live up to expectations. There is so much wasted time on subjects that won't matter to me in the future. I'm not allowed to get a job because of school. I want to be independent and not have to rely on my mom for things but she still forbids me from getting a job.

The only person to ever really make me break down into an ugly mess of tears and snot is my mother. The only place that is so good (cause of my friends) but makes me so depressed is school. I'm trying hard to give myself a successful music career so i can do what I love. I love playing games with my friends and having fun. I wish i could get my mom to see that.

26,"September 2018 was the beginning of the end for me. I asked out this girl to homecoming who told me no. It's not that big a deal. Sure it stung, but hey I moved on. 

By November I'm pretty sure I checked out of reality, I started believing that everyone at my school thought I had taken a picture of the girl's ass I had asked out. It drove me crazy. I was avoiding everyone and going crazy. I remember crying about it for a long time. Then, I went sideways. I started believing I did that to my sister. That I had taken a picture of my sister's ass. It drove me crazy. I was thinking about suicide constantly, I remember thinking that this might be the end. It was a secret, but I would've had to hold onto it forever. I can't stress how suicidal I was, I thought about it constantly. To be clear, I remembered it as a memory. I was obsessing over timelines, asking friends what they remembered around dates, etc. 

By around mid-April, I had thought through this event. I had convinced myself it was a false memory. My anxiety didn't improve though. I thought that I was a narcissist, I thought that I had autism and that everyone was lying to me, madness. In retrospect. Since then, my life hasn't improved. I went off to college. Please, I just want to be happy again. I feel so disconnected from reality. I feel so far away.",20Dec2020,1
27,"Hi. This isn’t something that I would ever do but I just need someone to talk to. 

I’ve been dealing with depression for awhile, but last year I made a new friend and he kind of helped me out of it. He’s my only friend but I haven’t seen him since may due to me being deployed and then him deploying before I got back and recently I’ve been spiraling again. 

I started dating someone new in October and that kind of helped with me not feeling so alone but that ended yesterday and I’m now more depressed than I was before. 

It scares me because I have thoughts all day long about not wanting to be alive. I won’t do anything to act on them, but it’s a horrible thought to continually think about wanting to be dead. I have no family or friends in the state I’m stationed in and I can’t tell my parents about how I’m feeling because I just don’t think they would understand. 

I also can’t seek help from medical professionals because it will affect my job. I don’t know what to do. I just want to be happy, but no matter what I do people keep leaving me.",20Dec2020,1

I’m 19F and in premed, I’m smart but in a relationship I want someone that makes me feel stupid. I want to be taken care of and put in my place and put down in a loving/teasing way and I don’t know why. I always look for a partner that is controlling and makes all the decisions for me because I don’t like to make decisions, I’m extremely indecisive. I was emotionally neglected, whenever I cried my dad would  just go “cry, (my name), cry”. I had major meltdowns to the point of going to a child support group for what my parents called anxiety at around 10/11. At this age I was compulsively washing my hands to the point they were cracked and bleeding. I told my mom about suicidal thoughts when I was 13, I was also self harming but left that out, she invalidated me. She told me it was normal and I didn’t need the therapy even though I asked for it. It was a conversation that led me to never open up to anyone fully again, I recently brought it up and she doesn’t even remember it. I recently told her about the self harm and she said that’s only for people who have been molested and was confused why I did it then as there was nothing wrong with me. I gained 40lbs in a few months and spent years spending every second not in school in my room from 16 to 17, never socialized despite having opportunities and missed over 40 days of school in a year. My parents continued to insist there was nothing wrong with me mentally. I feel like there’s something majorly wrong with me but I can’t figure out what it is and have never been able to get a diagnosis because I’ve been told my whole life that I am normal.

I have been dealing with very confusing and complicated mental struggles for at least the last 6 years. I have lived with it without too much complications this far but it is getting worse. I have been putting this off for years but I think I really do need professional help. 90% of the time it doesn't really bother me, but the other 10% it gets really really bad. Everytime it gets bad I realise in how much trouble I am and how much terror this could create. That is when I realise I need to try to stop this right fucking now.
But then things get better and I simply (want to) forget about it. Life goes on ey. Well this actually dangerous game of procrastination needs to stop.

untill I have made the cal for professional help. Yes, I already know what number to call, what to say, and I know it is the right move. I just have shoved it forward for at least a couple of months, and it's been enough. Please help me clear this mental border, I really can't permit to talk myself out of it again

31,"I'll try to keep it brief.  Last week my husband started showing some worrying symptoms, having delusions, believing I was in extreme danger and that people were coming to hurt me.

This all came to a head on Friday morning and I asked a friend to come help me sit with him while I called different facilities, tried to figure out our insurance, etc as it became clear he needed more help than I can give him.

We took him to the emergency room and he has been there since then, admitted medically for now but has undergone a psych evaluation and will probably be transferred to the floor tomorrow.  It has been around 8 hours since we have spoken and I'm really struggling with feelings of guilt and anxiety.

32,"Hello everyone, I'm not sure this has the right subreddit, I hope so, but here is my problem. 
I've seen my therapist 8 times so far. She tells me we are still into the get-to-know phase, at this stage I'm not feeling much relief and we are yet to make a plan or a progress whatsoever.

She gave me tests and tasks to complete and I executed. This week she gave me the task of writing down 'the chapters of my life', 1 page, 1 year she said, but I don't know how to do it, I don't really want to either, my mind goes blank and I get discouraged because this means that before we start actually doing something to improve the situation, there will still be some time to get-to-know. 
Friends of mine going through the process told me that their get-to-know phase was much quicker, averaging at 4 times, so I was wondering if I should stop seeing her and look for someone else or if this is normal. 

Should I tell her I'll stop? How can I be respectful about it? She seems such a nice person, I don't want to make trouble for her. She is a cognitive behavioural therapist, I've been advised by my mother (clinical psychologist) to switch to a systemic therapy approach, do you have anything to comment on this?

36,"I (24F) am worried about my mother's mental health and the affect that it is starting to have on my close family, especially my brother (14). For context my mum and ex step dad were in a toxic relationship for 13 years, emotional abuse, financial abuse, controlling behaviour, gaslighting etc. towards my mum. They broke up 8 years ago and my siblings still see their father. It's clear that the abuse over the years (and maybe other things) have had a serious detrimental affect to my mum's mental health, perhaps PTSD. What it troubling me most is that I believe my mum now looks at my brother in the same way she does at his father (her ex). He can be a little shit, general teenage boy stuff plus ADHD, but more and more my mum treats him like he is an abusive partner. Telling him he is abusive, locking herself away from him and not dealing with issues. It has gotten to the point where their relationship is very toxic. A few weeks ago my brother moved in with his dad (which I don't think long term will really help anything). My mum is hard to have a conversation with and I don't want to seem like I am blaming her for her abuse, but I know it is having a bad affect on my brother's mental health. I don't know where to turn, I have told my mum I think she needs to go back to therapy and her response is why should I get therapy just so I can cope with being abused.

41,"My (25-m) brother (30-m) has experienced a noticeable mood/personality change over the past 4-5 years, becoming worse in recent years. I’m not a mental health expert, but his symptoms do not appear to fit an obvious diagnosis. If anyone has any experience with the following symptoms, please let me know. I want to support him in the best way possible so that he can get the help he needs to turn his life around.

- He is outwardly very happy. Whenever you see him, he has a huge smile and is eager to start a conversation.
- He has very little motivation to do anything productive in his life. While he is very smart (he has a masters degree and an incredible memory) he has not been able to secure a full time job. He’s applying for teaching jobs, which are very competitive, but he doesn’t appear to be angry/sad/let down when he doesn’t get them. He is perfectly content to watch TV all day. He’s currently studying for a certification test that he’s already failed, but he’ll study for maybe 30 minutes per day and spend the rest of the day relaxing.
- He needs help with everything. Opening doors, carrying things in the house, pouring glasses of water. Today he fell in the snow getting out of the car and lay flat on his back, waiting for me to help pick him up. When I did, I was carrying his entire weight; he wasn’t even trying to get up.
- He doesn’t have a social life. Even before COVID, he rarely saw his friends and hasn’t had a girlfriend since he was 23. This has been especially noticeable because he used to have an extensive social life, spending tons of time with a large group of friends. Now, his best friend is my grandmother. Again, this doesn’t seem to bother him.
- He has never lived away from home and has no motivation to move out. In fact, he often “jokes” that he’s never going to move out. He has had emotional breakdowns when my parents have talked about moving into elderly housing in the future.
- He is incredibly nostalgic about the past, reminiscing about mundane memories from 15+ years ago as if they were major moments in his life.
- He can seem emotionally immature. At family parties, he’s most like hanging out with my young cousins.
- He is completely unaware of basic social conventions.
- He used to smoke and drink casually, but now he doesn’t smoke, drink, or even drink coffee.
- he has no ability to overcome the slightest bit of adversity.

Before, he was a relatively self-sufficient, social young adult with concrete goals (he even talked about moving hundreds of miles away!). Now, it’s clear that something is off and his life has taken a turn.

44,"Hi all, not sure where else can I rant out. Please excuse my English if it is not so good (Malaysian here).

I lost my very close aunt to cancer in 2013, it was a blow to everyone in the family as she was the magnet during gatherings and get together. In April 2019, I lost my grandmother (79yrs old) who was so healthy but gone too soon. My aunty and my grandma was my main mental support as I can share anything with them.

1). Yesterday, I visited my critically ill mother at the hospital and although the family has been informed in advanced but hearing from the doctor's own mouth feels like a blow. My mother has throat cancer stage 4 whereby the tumor is now the size of a tennis ball. Nothing can be done as it is an aggressive type of cancer. She is very thin/fragile, has tube in her nose for milk intake (only milk as food source), 2 days ago she had 2 bags of blood transfusion and she is in extreme pain. She can't talk so she has to write to communicate. I had never cried the hardest until I left the hospital and reached home. It is tormenting to see loved ones suffering like this.

2). My immediate neighbor has been giving hell for years. They threw prawn and crab skin into my house, threw smelly plastic that smells like fish has been kept inside and everyday now throwing cat shit + litter sand into the drain in between our house. There are floating poo in the drain water. They have been neighbors for 20 years. In the past when I was a teenager, their son mess around with our bras and undies (mom and I) until my mom caught them red handed by putting tons of flour at where they will step to reach the lingeries. The footprints lasted for more than a week because of rain hardening up the flour. Footprints also led to their steps so it is like a spotlight for other neighbors to see.

There was a whole year I did not live in this house as my family moved out (house not sold yet) and this neighbor took the opportunity to park their cars in front the house gate (free parking daily + convenience), I moved back because I have dogs and it isn't easy to find a place that will accommodate my dogs.

3). I am trying to sell off this house but because of covid it makes it harder, in the meantime I don't wish to live here for another year. Sorry for the long rant, my community group isn't very helpful as they ignored my messages. I don't know how to find peace in this wellbeing.",20Dec2020,1
45,"I'll quickly explain the phases:

1) 13-20 years: Started masturbating to Divas wrestling cards of all things, then quickly to lesbian sensual content on youtube, finally into porn. I never really desired the real thing, the conveniency and the great ability to load porn , fap , aim and shoot could not be beaten. Best bang for buck as far as orgasms go.

2) 20-23 : Porn withdrawl (with relapses). it was a self improvement and self discipline thing, worked to a point. But at the same time I began scratching my head to the amount of time and resources men waste to pursue sex. Those who diverge like Sir Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Bill Gates, Bill Bellichick ,Lee Kuan Yew seemed destined to become world class, the #1 in their respective fields. So why did men accepted the gap from the #1 to grow to such wide, all this for sex? What an absurdity! At the end of the day if you ain't first you are last! When you are #1 and you still want sex you can recoup if you want.

3) 23-25 years old : Started to analyze trading strategies in the sexual marketplace, this is parallel to me analyzing trading strategies in the stocks and bonds marketplace. I started making assessments assigning ratings 0 to 100 to girls (never liked the 0-10 scale, very imprecise, unless you use decimal points). The entry price in terms of time and effort to lay a 85/100 and up girls. The diminishing returns from 85 to 100, and the elasticity of supply and demand due to season and the menstrual cycle which make girls more or less receptive and thus raises or diminishes the effort needed for a lay.

4) 25-26 years old: Think I have a good understanding of the sexual market phenomenons, I know exactly where to travel, how to carry myself on social media and real life to execute, also the moment to enter and to exit the market to minimize shifts. Have a good confidence I can lay a couple of 85/100 girls per week at a very good entry point, also know when to exit a trade and the entry and exit signals.

In the meantime during the 4 phases progression my libido went more and more downwards and in the last year it dropped almost parallel to the y-axis , now I don't even have it.

I attribute it to the 4 phases above, well actually the 3 phases beyond the initial fapping which is done by many and doesn't damage the libido of many people (you only see those who suffer from it posting online due to the sampling bias). 


Mostly it's the phase 2-3-4: My brain started seeing sex as something to avoid to save time/resources and outcompete people to be #1 in legacy cementing domains such as science, data analysis, business or trading . Alternatively something to do , but not for the pleasure of the act, but the pleasure of outcompeting other people at it and then look at the data to see how I had outcompeted them and get a kick that way.

I'm also worried about lack of Nocturnal Penile Turmescence (wet dreams) and morning wood, mostly I'm worried because the post ejaculation clarity gave me lots of good ideas and now without ejaculation I cannot possibly get the clarity and It seems like I'm missing out of lots of good business and trading ideas.

is there some literature on these topics, I want to know what i'm up against",20Dec2020,1
46,"Hey all, I have a topic I would appreciate some input and advice on.

(21M)  Let me explain.
I have noticed basically throughout my entire teen and young adult life that I am always mentally drained and do not have the capacity to concentrate, think clearly, and am always achey in my joints and stomach etc from the moment I wake up to the time that I go to bed of a night. I believe this is trauma related.

I have had somewhat of a traumatic upbringing with my mother being a very abusive non functioning alcoholic, my parents were never together since I was born and my father commited suicide when i was 8 years old. Ive been homeless and grew up around drugs and criminals most of my lifetime. I briefly went through the child protection system and left my mother to live with my grandparents at the age of 13, and they have since passed away. A range of other things in this story aswell but these are the main points.

I have seen psychologists over my lifetime and have been diagnosed with Reactive attachment disorder as a child and more recently been clinically diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder, CPTSD and cannot regulate my thoughts or emotions efficiently. I have nightmares and flashbacks at minimum every 20 minutes during my days (which cause me to have severe bodily jerking reactions and very angry or sad outrage episodes in which i cant see my thoughts) this has gone on for some years now and seems to be getting worse. I've started to see another psychologist longterm to attempt to manage my situation as effectively as possible. 

But I'm always tired and drained and cannot even physically hear people when they speak because of my intrusive thoughts and it feels as though im always in survival mode or fight or flight, are there any management tips that others in my situation could offer? Ive checked all of my health markers by doctors and they all come up perfectly, i meditate, exercise and read often. I do use the internet too much which im working on as we speak. I dont use alcohol or drugs at all and my diet is on point with as much healthy food as possible. My instincts lead me to believe that this brain drain is caused by the exertion on my body and brain of being fearful and unsure/ fight or flight constantly. I imagine this takes an incredible amount of energy to sustain and is only designed to be used in a truly life threatening situation but through my traumas is activated on a far more regular basis than the average person. 

If you have any input I sincerely appreciate your opinion and ill try anything at this point except drugs, ive tried a number of antipsychotics and antidepressants with very little positive effect over the course of years.",20Dec2020,1

While spending the last few years trying to mask everything I hated about myself, I unintentionally projected myself as a hopeless person who wants to stop living at any moment.

To be fair I am a hopeless person, but I didn’t want many people knowing that. Plus I’m not actively suicidal. I personally think I’m not the suicidal type and would only use it as a last resort. I just look like it. I guess I need to do better at looking positive and okay. I need to stop treating myself badly, but that’s all I know how to do. I feel like I deserve it when I know I don’t.

But then friends think I need to be more open. People are complicated. How do I stop coming off as suicidal?",20Dec2020,1

I dont want to get into specific details...but every time id try to come to her with something big or small, id get screamed at and blamed and she would make it about herself. if i got in trouble for anything, i would get screamed at. don’t get me wrong, i was not and am not a perfect person, and i know i have been in the wrong too. over time, this recurring theme of her screaming at me every time something was wrong, i began to hide things. i wouldnt tell her things, regardless of what it was. im off living on my own, but im in town for the holidays, and i find myself scared of her. The thought of her screaming at me, and even just reflecting back on past circumstances with her from years ago gives me extreme anxiety. I don’t know if i have some sort of trauma or what. I feel like i do, but i could be overreacting. Idk. I dont think i am tho, i cant feel this way for no reason. I have two younger sisters, and she doesnt do this to them. Which confuses me.

Sometimes I wonder if it’s better that I don’t have friends. I usually end up getting hurt in the end, which deters me from getting too close to anyone. The problem is, there is no one for me to reach out to or to chat with about common interests or about things that are on my mind. It’s lonely.

I'm not sure where it came from. It was a really good night, something I really needed in a while because of COVID.

59,"TW: Illness, possible ED? 

I’ve always been terrified of being sick. Ever since I was little, I’d go into full panic attacks when someone would cough, sneeze, or belch. 

I used to punch my brother hard when he did that because he knew it bothered me. 

I’m now twenty years old and am in my third year of college and I’m struggling hard. 

Not only am I deathly terrified of being sick (especially in the the middle of a pandemic), but I’ve now resorted to cleaning all the time, and I’ve never not been seen without putting hand sanitizer on every three to four minutes. 

The worst part, however is that I’m so scared to eat because I don’t want to get sick. My parents tell me that I’m just being silly and acting for attention- but in reality I don’t know what’s wrong or why I’m doing this. 

I want to eat. I can manage a couple of bites before I start panicking. This is just on repeat, all the time. 

I’m just not sure what wrong or why I’m suddenly like this. I was eating normally before, I didn’t just think about staying healthy all day long- this just isn’t healthy. 

I don’t want anyone here to give me a diagnosis, I just need some encouragement or just someone to validate my issues because I don’t get that at all from friends or family. 

TLDR: My fear of illness is now so crazy that I’m too scared to eat and can’t stop cleaning my house and hands.",20Dec2020,1
60,"I have gone to therapy on and off since 8th grade (I’m a 25 y/o college grad now). Decided to go back because of my reoccurring depression and anxiety.

I was hesitant to go because I have had bad experiences in the past. The first time I went for self harm, the therapist told me it must just be hormones and to pretend to be happy because eventually I would fool myself..not the best thing to tell someone contemplating suicide and self harming daily..

Regardless I felt like it was the proactive thing to do because I felt myself slipping back into the dark place. After two 45 minute sessions this woman thinks she has me completely pegged. Tells me to break up with my boyfriend of 3 years after 1 mild argument and that she’s recommending I go on Zoloft. (She specially mentioned this drug which is sus as hell to me considering she knows close to nothing about me).

I told her I’m hesitant to go on meds because I prefer natural treatment and meditation and she said it doesn’t sound like I’m ready to deal with my mental health and that CBT won’t work for me because it seems like I don’t have the ability to cope. 

She said I refuse to open up and deal with my problems and that medication is basically the only option.

I was so flabbergasted because I had legitimately cried half of the first session talking about my past trauma. I felt so gaslighted and misunderstood. I told her i feel really upset at her suggestion and uncomfortable with her telling me to leave my relationship and hung up the phone..

This is legitimately why I have avoided therapy for years. I got off the phone with her and couldn’t stop crying because I felt so hopeless.

I have been so exhausted from work and college these past few weeks that I absolutely cannot focus in being the best version of myself to my friends. This entire Saturday I was extremely full of anxiety because I just finished finals and my internship is going to end in two weeks, so knowing I have or will have nothing to do is driving me nuts. On top of that, these weren't very healthy situations either.

I feel like I need to have better coping mechanisms at work, especially when I dont know anything. I need to learn how to take breaks. I need to learn how to take criticism. I need to learn how to forgive myself. I also especially need to learn how to learn. Without these things, I won't make it in the future, and neither will my friendships.

My friend noticed a behavior I was picking up recently. When they would try to explain something to me, I would totally dismiss it or be rude to them about it. They snapped at my for my behavior and my personality changes. I told them that I was going through the problems above and I was probably taking out my frustration at them. They are also kind to me, so I totally snapped when they continued to do so.

This person, I talk to every single day. So my hope is that they forgive me for taking the next few days to prioritize my mental health and learn to be my own best friend again. To learn how to relax, how to sit still, how to take things one at a time, how to shower and eat food and live in the moment slowly and carefully.

I've experienced this feeling for a while now and I have no idea what it is or what to call it. Suddenly and at seemingly random times it's like I just ""shut off"". My eyes become fixed on a random point and it feels almost impossible to move them. I can't really move but I can force myself to move very unnaturally in a way that almost feels like I'm telling my body what to do instead of just doing it. I am mostly unable to talk during these events. They are sometimes short and sometimes longer, and most of the time I can fight through them and force my body to move itself. 

My boyfriend doesn't understand. Every time I have one of these events he always thinks he's pissed me off somehow (even though I don't even get like that and usually if he pisses me off I tell him directly, so I don't know what he's thinking honestly). I get really frustrated because I don't know how to explain what's going on and he won't stop acting like he's in trouble around me. I'm not mad at him because I know he just doesn't understand what I'm going through. 

I did some research and found out about dissociation but I'm not sure if it fits but it's the closest term I've found to describe the feeling. I don't really feel like I'm out of my body, I just feel like I can't really function, and doing anything, even just looking up, is a huge struggle.

I will be with friends, or walking down the hall at work, and out of no where I get this sinking feeling. It’s the deepest depression, my soul literally aches, I can feel it in my chest. It hits suddenly and it’s like I can feel my chemicals changing. It lasts a couple seconds or minutes and then I’m fine. Often times it happens when I’m happy or with people having fun. I mentioned it to my counselor and she said that maybe it’s overstimulation and my brain reacts by just shutting down? It doesn’t greatly affect my life, but I’ve never heard of anyone else feeling this.

Next year I want to start seeing a therapist, partly for what I believe to be mild/moderate depression (that I’ve had symptoms of since I was 16), and partly because I just feel like I have a lot of things I keep bottled up that I need to unpack. Even my closest friends don’t know everything about me or the things I am/have struggled with, and neither do my parents. I’m hoping therapy will teach me how to be more vulnerable and open with the people in my life. 

I got a referral, and my health insurance from work will cover (virtual) visits. The issue is, I’m not sure how to tell my parents I’ll be starting this. I know they’re not opposed to therapy, because my brother has more severe depression and they got him a therapist immediately after learning it. But I don’t want to explain that I have been feeling depressed since I was in high school, because they’ll ask why I never told them, and like I said, I feel really uncomfortable talking about my mental health problems in real life. My mom especially tends to worry and I don’t want it to be a big deal. (Yeah, I’m aware this is exactly the type of thing I should be going to a therapist for, lol.) 

Yet, because I’m working on being more honest (and logistically, because I’ll be attending appointments from their house), I feel like I should say something about it to them.

I’ve had issues with alcohol for the last 10 years, and I don’t know if this has now caught up to me or what. I have these moments when I feel like I am losing my mind and am going insane. I constantly am paranoid that nothing is real and that I’m making things up in my head, along with having intrusive thoughts and my brain will not shut off. I repeat sayings out loud over and over again to calm down. What scares me the most is that I do this without even thinking(but not around people, only when I’m alone). The things I am saying lately are, “I cannot do this anymore”. I begin to get teary (and I never cry normally) and lately have been sort of making plans to leave. I’m not suicidal to the point where I would ever act on it. I have never felt this bad and in these moments I just do not think I can go on like this. I am physically ill over the anxiety and paranoia and get so nauseated, along with all of my muscles getting tense with no relief. I recently cut back on drinking a lot, but sometimes I have to go on a nightly bender just to chill the F out and feel good for once. Then the following day it accelerates the awful anxiety episodes for hours until I have to take a Xanax, or just hope to eventually sleep it off. I don’t have any friends or anyone I can talk to.

i have such a fear of being considered toxic, but im so exhausted. we have drifted quite a bit too. we text, maybe not as often as id want to, though. it feels like we don't have much to talk about anymore. we don't have many common interests, we don't play the same games, listen to the same songs, etc. there isn't much to work with. and i think a big reason for my fear that i am being toxic is the fact that it upsets me when they apologize so much. they will apologize for me reacting to little things in a normal way, such as if we are just talking normally, they will apologize for something. which is fine, but at the same time, it upsets me because it makes me feel like i am coming across as angry. but i consider myself understanding, i don't know why im losing my patience with such a little thing, even if i don't be rude about it or anything, i just assure them it's fine, im worried it's toxic that i care so much and get so upset about it. 

man, i want this shit to last, but it's exhausting. we get no where when we talk about things, and im so worried it's my fault.",20Dec2020,1
82,"Everyone is so goddamn fake all the time.  I don't get why people can't just be fully honest.  I'm not necessarily talking about opening up and being completely vulnerable, I'm talking about people playing the social games.  I see it with my sister the most, she has tons of friends but all she does is complain about them.  I try to give her solutions like don't talk them or tell them you don't like them, but she can't do it and neither can her friends.  I saw the same thing much more frequently when I was doing in-person school.  I'd see people talking like they're best friends, then later they would come up to me and complain about the other one.  One of the examples of this was with this one that half my class hated, but never said anything.  The only person he knew didn't like him was me, and I think that's part of why everyone hated him.  They would act all friendly, and some of them almost like fangirls to this guy, giving this gigantic fucking ego, making them hate him more because now he thinks he's the shit.  If you don't like someone, just tell them or don't be around them.  Don't act like you're best buds.  If it hurts their feelings that one person doesn't like them, they need to grow some fucking balls and realize that not everyone is gonna like them",20Dec2020,1

84,"i have severe brain fog, and have always ""turned my brain off"" frequently since my POTS got worse around puberty. 

by ""turn my brain off"" i mean i sit and stare at the floor and just don't think, i don't feel the need to, i have to force myself to have thoughts, and i don't blink and my eyes don't even start to itch or feel like they're drying out. 

i just had this weird moment a couple hours ago where i felt like i had run into jello. and i had to consciously make make an effort to think and move. i wasn't scared, or confused, nothing. i was just kinda like ""huh..."". and even then that ""huh..."" was forced. 

i told my boyfriend about it and he told me it sounds like dissociation. he's no expert by any means and i know everything's different for everyone but he dissociates, so hearing that coming from someone who knows they dissociate is a little concerning to me. 

i have POTS, as i mentioned, which also causes depression and anxiety for me. i also have OCD. also probably worth mentioning i have never experienced any trauma, aside from being ""backstabbed"" n such by ""friends"" lol

this has happened before but i never thought about it afterwards like i have been this time. i don't remember when or how it stopped, but it did. i was just building a house in the sims and i might have been listening to music but i don't remember

85,"For as long as I can remember I've had a burning hatred for change. For  reasons upon reasons, I hate it. Anything changing, weather it's my age, my shoes, my room, my house, to things no one cares about, such as a building I've never gone into renovating or changing. It feels off, as if something isn't how it should be. I don't just go, ""Aw, that thing has been in my life for a while"" and move on. I consistently will think about it, till I'm either brought to tears, or I force myself into thinking of something else. Here are a few recent examples:

A. My room was recently completely changed (and I mean new walls, flooring, the whole room setup, etc.). We had to get bunkbeds for my little sister, meaning the bed I've had all my life is gone, which tore me apart. Every night all I think about is how much I miss the comfort of laying in my bed, with the same music I would listen to every night playing softly next to me. The walls were painted a different shade of white, the flooring is no longer carpet and is now wooden flooring, my room layout if completely different, and lots of my childhood things were taken out. Nothing feels the same, including myself. It doesn't make me feel like me.

B. My shoes have been the same pair for the past three years. If I go out in any other pair I don't feel like myself, instead being a different person. Same goes for my outfit honestly, and my clothing style. No matter how old and how badly they're falling apart every month, I'd rather get weird looks from peers than feel the sadness I'd feel getting rid of them.

C. My fathers truck was sold recently, and this for some reason felt like the end of the world to me. I remember having to put my sunglasses on so no one would see me cry. That same week we got rid of all my childhood stuffed animals, which already made me ball for weeks.

Soooo yep. Now, I would chalk all this up to me being emotionally attached to objects, people, and places, and I wouldn't have even asked this on reddit. But what I wanna know is this: Why does it effect my personality, and who I am? 

For some reason, I tend to refer to myself as a character. I do activities I think ""Abby"" (my name) would do, or clothing ""Abby"" would wear, and stuff like that. And even locations make me think, ""Abby doesn't live there."" So why is that? If anything changes, ""the story changes."" Aka, my life. In my head I'm not a person, I'm a character created by me, and her name is Abby. I've made my personality, my locations, my friends, my weaknesses, and my views as if it's a fictional tale. The issue is I don't have much control over these things, so if something even small changes I can't take it.

I know this is long, and quite honestly don't know if it's a mental health issue. All I know is I want answers, or atleast someone elese point of view/perspective on this.",20Dec2020,1
86,"A few months ago, maybe even a year ago, I got prescribed 20mg of Fluoxetine but was too scared to take them.

88,"When I was 15 years old I had 4 or more drug induced grand mil seizures in the same night, one at my friends at 3 at the hospital. My doctor had me get a MRI scan, a cat scan, and a EEG, he then diagnosed me with epilepsy. I’m 20 years old now and he has me on Wellbutrin because every single ssri and snri didn’t work for me and reacted really bad to my body. One of the side effects to this medication are seizures but I’m on a med and have been on for years benzodiazepines to control my seizures and anxiety. He doesn’t tell me anything so basically what I’m wonder is what made him diagnose me with epilepsy and be so strict on the fact I’m still epileptic I’m legitimately still prone to having seizures or not. Note: I dance with a led whip but only on solid, I cannot handle most lights if they are flickering or flashing, certain noises are triggering, Wellbutrin is also still giving me severe anxiety. Is this a lifetime thing? I’m on 150mg Wellbutrin, 5mg clonazepam, and 50mg quitepine but I rarely take the 50mg.

89,"Hey, I'm a 17M and next month I turn 18. I have been struggling with depression and anxiety since middle school. To be fair, I did have some good two years with this girl who I knew since elementary but never pulled a move till high school (we were both introverted and anxious messes). But I broke up due to not feeling that connection anymore and it has been two years of feeling like I have no direction again.

Last year was my most self-destructive. I failed every class and lost joy for my hobbies. I find any recreational activity I do today pointless and do it passively. Then I get these random thoughts of regret and think of alternative futures of me being happy or in love again. It seemed like that kid who had a passion for computer science is gone and this imposter who would rather sleep all day and live in regret takes his place. I just listen to the same playlist everyday, watch videos to pass time or in some cases force myself to sleep.

I wanted to ask if I can get anti-depressants without my family knowing?  I know I should talk to them but that is the last thing I want to do. I truly just want this to be as anonymously as possible between a doctor and me. This would be my first time talking about my mental health issues since my old teacher told me to meet him after class to talk privately. He noticed a kid who usually averaged B's/go from F's and was just asking questions. We were both suprised when I had a breakdown before his eyes. That was the only time I cried in my teen years. Just his questions of what was wrong and how I felt and just him repeating it over and over. These flurry of emotions just came out and as hard as I tried to keep my emotions in I couldn't fight it. He sent me to this counselor who only saw me a couple of times. I have difficulty and anxiety talking about these issues with others I don't trust. My family is great but I don't feel comfortable talking to them about this. 

So if you can tell me the process of getting anti-depressants to relieve some anxiety? Can I get them online? How much is the cost? Is there some that relieve anxiety?

On a positive note, I'm doing better in school. I managed to stay on top of my work and I'm gonna try to get in this trade school. I just am not happy or at peace and don't know if that will stop this. I told myself if this doesn't get better in 10 years I will leave everything behind and become a drifter in LA as a joke but I might do something drastic in the future if nothing changes.

Thank you and if you are struggling, I hope you get better.",20Dec2020,1

This is my first time posting to Reddit ever, so please take it easy on me!  Big vulnerability moment here 😬. I am an MEM (mother enmeshed male) and have strong learned narcissistic tendencies. My mother has narcissistic personality disorder and my father is an enabler to her. In the “narcissistic family” I am the golden child. I have come to this realization through recent intensive psychotherapy. For the sake of my marriage and basically my life overall, I am trying to find my true self (rather than false). I am really struggling with this. How do I find who I really am, rather than the person I think people want me to be? I feel lost and like I don’t know who I really am. It’s terrifying.

I am thoroughly and completely broken, all the time. I am stuck in a loop that began very subtly, and, frankly, also purposefully, because I was a child indulging in the only feelings available to her. I find myself protecting my childhood innocence as if she is present and presently needs protecting. I am 25, and she is a broken rib that I am bent over in pain trying to protect from any mild harm that could make the pain worse and the deafening eternity of life seem longer.

I find myself debating *how* I could even begin to undo all the harm that was done to me. 

I reprimand myself for feeling sorry for myself, but that does not stop me in any capacity from feeling sorry for myself, it simply adds a layer of self-hatred to the preexisting self-pity. 

I have spent a decade of my life confronting former guardians who have failed completely at guardianship, and received apologies so empty that they reveal a black hole that oozes terror and consumes anything that is good.

I have lost interest in everything that ever excited me. I am not able to share my body with anyone in love or passion. I am dead in every way but physical, and I want more than anything to enjoy a sense of normalcy and my youth.

But if any of you have more concrete advice, have an idea of some other things she may potentially start doing, or just want to give any opinions at all, I would appreciate it to no end.

For context, we both struggle with mental health. We both deal with anxiety and depression a lot, and she’s had to contend with eating disorders. I’m also on the spectrum, Aspergers specifically. I’ll try answering any further questions.

today is my birthday, i hate birthday, i hate everything, i hate social media, u know, everything looks fake, ive seen my friend reposting their story saying happy bday etc, i have some close friend but when it is my birthday, nobody give a damn. i have hundreds of friend on instagram, only 3 of them replied to my 1 and only stories saying happy bday to me.. im 25, and yeaah, i need to find real friend. im always worried about everything, tho it is better than a year ago, i still take my meds, and i use social media quite rarely nowadays.

I am currently struggling with dealing with expectations, both from me myself and from my friends/my family.

This is my objective but I cannot pinpoint what exactly has to change in my mindset and how I should change it. How do you find the right balance?

115,"So, the title is a bit misleading. I never watched this movie, but I was told the plot of it as a kid. To this day, the movie is a serious trigger for me. The main problem now is if I see the movie poster. And if I were to see a picture of the movie, I would have no clue how I wouldn’t handle it. It would probably cause me to cry &amp; heave uncontrollably.

The movie is called h*man c*ntipede. Please excuse me not being able to write the whole name out, but just looking at the censored name makes me feel disgusting, and the whole thing would be really hard to look at. I should note that this was several years ago that I was traumatized by the plot of this movie. I am now 19, and I am still feeling the effects of it, well over 10 years later. I am now extremely enamored by the horror genre (even the goriest, most fucked up horror movies). But this movie has stuck with me for far too long.

When I was very very young, I was told the plot of this movie and it shook me to my core. For a long time, I was deeply triggered by the number 3, bending over, centipedes &amp; caterpillars, the word “human”, and any stitching on human flesh. (These are legitimate claimz, I promise.) To this day, I find myself a little bit better at handling these triggers. I am able to say the title of the movie out loud during the daytime, and I even had the courage to ask my friend to read me a plot description (something I deeply regretted that night). My main fear is ever seeing a picture from this movie. That is my biggest fear in the whole world.

The other day, I was wearing a white face mask, and upon realizing that having a mass of white stitching around my mouth was reminiscent of that movie, and I jumped so hard, the car I was driving swerved. I still have nightmares about this movie’s plot. I had to unsubscribe from my favorite youtube channel, Deadmeat (which reviews horror movies) because I became far too afraid that he would review this movie and put a picture of it in the thumbnail. Please help me!

My main problem is that people who carry trauma have been through legitimately traumatizing events, but the deep scarring I carry with me is just from a movie I was merely told the plot of. I think it hurt me so deeply because it was a realistic story that was far more fucked up than anything I could ever have imagined. The issue is, if I had learned about this movie today instead of back then, I would have been the one who made my friends watch it &amp; laughed at its ridiculousness. Do you have any advice for handling this trauma? Or does this even count as trauma? Is this all in my head?",20Dec2020,1

I don't blame her.. but she was my only hope to live. Now I have no one to love.. I was just not meant to be loved, everyone I've ever cared for has eventually left. 

(Everything was perfect, just.. the time wasn't right for her, she has alot on her plate so I don't blame her at all..)

I had so many future and life plans with her and now all that's left is the emptiness of her leaving and I don't think anything can fix this.. I don't even know what to do with my life now. All my plans were with her..

I can't study for shit and studying is essential if you want to survive in this world, let alone be ""happy"". I don't even know if I'll be done with high school this year or not. This year has been terrible for my mental health and I couldn't study anything the entire year, and the finals are getting closer and I have nothing prepared plus now I got a heartbreak to deal with. I think I'll fail so hard. And then my family will fuck my non-existent mental health up.

I have an abusive family and so I don't even have that going for me.. I just got no one at all. I just wanted someone to love and be with and care for each other, love each other, tell each other secrets that no one in the world knows, be loyal to them and them only, respect them, take care of them, and have something that's fixed In my life that actually brings happiness, other than the sweet release of death (god I sound so emo lmao) but apparently that's asking too much.. 

I used to self harm regularly but my ex made me so happy that I just stopped, but I think I'll start cutting again too, as hurt as I am rn..

I am a teenager in the UK already suffering from anxiety and depression (Tried to kill myself quite a few times)  


So we all know as you grow up you become more sexually aroused and whatnot we've all been through it or going through it as we speak but some of you may or may not know the pornhub situation with the amount of CP, rape, abuse, etc.  


I use to get off to ""girlsdoporn"" when I am new-ish to exploring my body and then I find out around mid 2020 that they was involved in a scandal with some being underage, forced into doing things etc. Makes me feel very very very shitty and me with my already existing anxiety issues and wanting to end my life I started questioning if I got off to any kids or rape and whatnot without knowing it which just makes me feel shitty and ashamed, you ever just get off to porn and then at 2nd glance its like ""That don't seem right"" type of mood?   


It stems from this pornstar that went by the name ""str8ballin"" is well as all her reuploads are her being portrayed  as a teacher and the lad being a student you can still find them if you want to check it out of yourself and my head keeps thinking the worse of the worse that it was a teacher and the student was underage (when I mean student I must stress a collage student) he looked 17-18.  


To be honest these types of thoughts have been fucking with my mind since the incident I mentioned and has made me driven me into a corner and just be scared that one day I will just lose it and kill myself (already tried to 3-5 times this year) let alone me being in isolation 24/7 cause of me being homeschooled and whatnot so I have no social life.

126,"Hello,

I live close to red light district in Germany, it's like Amsterdam minus the tourists.

Some of the prostitutes in the district also act as Dominatrixes and offer BDSM-type sexual services. I am sexually submissive so I prefer the BDSM-type services. My guilty pleasure is to have the female strap a dildo in front of her and have anal sex with me. The first time the girl/women gave me poppers and we had a session I have been hooked.

Mainly beautiful Eastern European women offer these services for €100,= to € 200,= for 30 min to 1 hour. 

After these BDSM-sessions I feel energized to work and do my household chores, thus this way of living has become routine and it's a bit alarming.

I read on German internet forums about more (heterosexual) males act out these type of sexual fantasy's. Mostly these men write positive reviews about their BDSM-sessions and popper use, never are they alarmed or worried like me.

In the gay community there might be more of an understanding for the use of poppers, in contrast to admitting popper use to a heterosexual woman, she will likely be shocked and refuse a (sexual) relationship.

Recently I have ordered two bottles of poppers and watch a Femdom porn, while using them.

I hate to admit this was even better then the vanilla one-night stand I had a week earlier.

It has gotten me worries of not being able to have a normal heterosexual relationship in the future.

I don't now if I can ever be attracted to a regular randoms girl vagina. Some girls a little overweight and it's really hard to get aroused when I know how to create the ultimate orgasm with poppers and Femdom.

I am not the stable person and I have therapy on other fronts so I am seeking/getting help.

I am also worried for the health risk and addiction of poppers.

I used to take the poppers provided by the prostitutes. The prostitutes had brands such as rush, jungle juice and blue boy. The day-after side affects where sometimes quite heavy an the head and overall fatigue.

Recently I have bought my own bottle of poppers, and I feel a lot less side effects the day after.

When I had the appointment, I came out feeling so broken and lost. I couldn't tell if I had put my expectations way too high for the appointment leading myself to get disappointed, but fuck has it broken me.

Im struggling with university, but I thought to myself 'at least its christmas'.
Then my country went into lockdown, but I thought to myself 'at least I will still have my surgery'.
Then my surgery was cancelled and I thought to myself ' at least my family will be with me'.
Then they cancelled their flights because they felt it wasnt worth the risk (which is fair).


For the past two months my mental health has gotten worse and worse. I moved away from home this year to start my first year of university and its been really hard, Ive had mental problems before but felt that I had already recovered, that I didnt need help anymore. But I just cant keep up with the workload, and I dont want the university to know about my problems, I dont want them to treat me like a fragile nutjob.


The people I normally turn to arnt avaliable; my therapist is on holiday, my mother has broken down crying, the stress is just too much for her and I need to be strong for her, same goes with my sister. I have to be positive for my family, everyone is feeling low so I have to make them happy, I cant cry, I cant be angry, I cant breakdown.


I feel the same way I felt when I was self harming, this bottled up feeling, like Im trapped in a narrow tunnel and cant breathe. Ive been clean for a year now, I nearly relapsed last month, I dont want to relapse again but there is no one I can talk to.


One after the other, the situation gets worse and worse but the worst part is that I cant show how much it hurts, because my family is also hurting and I have to be there for them, especially my mother. Shes going through so much stress right now and I have to support her.


I dont know what to do, I feel like one tiny breeze will be enough to push me over the edge and try to hurt myself, I know Im in a dangerous spot, and I know I should call for help but there is no one to call.

136,"Hello everyone! 

I’m new to Reddit, so please bare with me! 

Basically, I believe (after doing some research) that I might have a mood disorder

To give you some context about me, I used to be a very calm and collected kid. I was always regulated, my mood was generally the same and I was never too happy or too sad

Now, I did have absolutely horrible social anxiety, I was not able to function fluently at work or school, so eventually I was put on Lexapro 10mg. 

The lexapro worked somewhat in the months that followed, but my social anxiety (and inner confidence in general) was still so terrible. I started smoking pot, per my friends suggestion and after smoking nightly for months boyyyyy did it make a difference. My social anxiety had made a huge improvement 

Fast forward to about one year later, and my smoking habits have escalated quite a bit. Most days, I smoke when I wake up, follow up multiple times throughout the day, and then just smoke as much as I want before bed. 

After that happened, this is how I feel now:

- I have no social anxiety whatsoever. I never ever have any problems talking to people and am so confident in myself.

- Most of the time I feel like I can take over the world and no one can stop me 

- I have an intense, un-ending motivation for my job. I have so much energy while I’m there, and can handle anything and know I’m doing a great job 

- I don’t care what people think about me, my own progress validates myself 

- I am so so so extremely happy. There is not a minute of the day that I don’t have a smile on my face and I love talking to random people as much as I can 

- The one bad thing is that my anger has also escalated a lot. I am so irritable now out of nowhere and literally turn into a complete asshole when I feel like someone has wrong done me

However, that usually lasts for about a few days to a week, and then I will suddenly crash.

When this happens, everything is terrible again. I’ll wake up in an anxiety attack, have no motivation to even shower or brush my teeth (on these days, I go to work without even getting ready at all) and constantly feel doomed going into my work day. When I get to work, I’m quiet the whole day, depressed, anxious, I’ll constantly go to the bathroom throughout the day and just sit there for a few minutes feeing like shit, wishing to god that for some reason ill get sent home for the day or something. During these times, I feel like I am just like broken down and can’t function like I usually do.

I know this is probably mostly caused by my weed usage, as I smoke a lot, but I’m confused because it really does help me so much. I love the times where my mood is good, I’m so much more powerful of a person than I used to be and I really am excelling at my job and my parents are very happy about that.

Thank you guys in advance for reading! Any guidance and worldly experience would be appreciated",20Dec2020,1
137,"I question this because when I look it up, like ways to reduce and “release” stress, it says things like: write it down, meditate, exercise, etc. 

Which, don’t get me wrong, I agree with most of them, it’s just how can you *physically* tell that you are indeed releasing stress, instead of just putting the current stressfulness in the back seat while you focus on those things?

Because for me, I struggle with generalize anxiety, which basically means I’m in stress mode constantly. I’m always on high alert &amp; worry about every move I make. Trust me I wish I could control it, but that’s just my makeup. 

Anyways, when I do one of these tasks for ‘stress release’—say I meditate—I may feel a bit less stressed in the moment, because I’m obviously not focusing on my stress, but afterwards it’s like I’m right back to square one. Stressed and tense AF. 

I understand that meditation specifically is meant to help you get out of that headspace, but for the overall stress reduction techniques, they all temporarily release or maybe just hide the current stress that’s being experienced. 

So no matter what I do, I will still always be stressed. If I were to live a more stressless life, I would have to live my life IN meditation, or DOING exercises, or WRITING the whole time. 

And I also understand that stress is inevitable, that it’s not all bad, but I just want to understand how you know that you’ve released stress. 

Because having a heart condition, makes me extra worrisome of letting myself get so stressed all the time in fear my heart will give out due to the constant stress I experience. (Yeah I’m 22) 

Like, is just the feeling of relaxation the sign that you’ve released stress? Loosened muscle tension? But then I go right back to being tense so it’s like almost pointless (in a sense) to do these if you will just feel stressed right after.

(I’m not at all trying to combat any stress release techniques, I’m just really curious how to know when you’ve released stress inside you so I can personally look for it myself &amp; just understand better)",20Dec2020,1

143,"So, I'm a minor so I live with my parents. The other week they told me and my older sister that we're going to Turkey for the entire summer. Ever since then I've be stressing over the approaching day.

To understand my stress, you first must understand me. I am a 14 year old man who has a cat named Leo that I love very much. I've had bad mental health since forever and my Arab parents have not helped at all. But, I've found ways to escape from my problems. I got a PS4 for my 10th birthday and got a Nintendo Switch Lite for my 14th birthday. I'm a gamer, and I often use video games to escape from reality and imagine myself as the character I'm playing as, who was usually a badass that doesn't take shit from anyone. I also often just spend time with my cat, and I often joke about him being my therapist. I don't know how I survived without him, and I'm damn sure that if we never got him, I'd probably be dead by now.

So now that you know about me, I think it goes without saying that I don't want to be anywhere without video games or my cat for more than a week. If we were only going for a week, it's fine I guess, the country may or may not be self imploding by the time we get there but, it's only a week. 3 whole months? Absolutely not. I don't know how to tell my parents that I don't want to go without sounding like the most spoiled and un-thankful piece of shit in the world, and if we do end up going, I know for a fact that I'm going to end up dead.

Thank you so much for listening and one last thing, my DMs are open for anybody that's struggling because I find that helping others is one of the best ways to make yourself feel good.",20Dec2020,1
144,"For more background: I’ve been slightly paranoid since I was around 11/12 but it’s gotten increasingly worse over the last 4 years. Sometimes it’ll be fine for a month, other times it’ll go for months at a time. I’ve brought it up to my psychiatrist but she acts like it’s just anxiety… is it? She also believes I have PTSD but won’t diagnose me with it for reasons I don’t know. (I was quite paranoid before some traumatic incidents). I almost constantly feel bugs crawling on me, a demon in the corner of my room (an entity so can’t see him but can sense him), everyone wants to hurt me or kill me, people watching me despite me being alone - all of these things follow me into my nightmares too which are very graphic and disturb me a lot. Sometimes though I’ll just feel as though people are watching me, and it might be like that for a couple months, next thing I know it’s the whole lot thrown in for months at a time. I don’t know if I’m just over thinking it or just want it to stop or if I just want answers honestly.",20Dec2020,1
145,"Long story short, im sad. I really truly dont love myself. Im constantly regretting how ive spent so much of my young adult life. Im 24 years old and feel like i have nothing to show for it. All i have is a good job. Thats it. I dont have a ton of fun memories with my friends, i was a late bloomer, i spent 5 years from the age of 18-23 in a relationship i shouldnt have been in for so fucking long. I just feel like ive missed out on so much of life. 

I just feel like ive never done what I wanted in life. My mom has always been super controlling and basically never let me have any freedom as a teenager. This resulted in me developing such anti social habits and a bad video game addiction, instead of experiencing life the right way. I feel so resentful and manipulated by her that all i want to is move halfway across the world right now. 

At 16 years old, i got my first girlfriend. She was outgoing, fun, attractive, social and everything any 16 year old kid would want at the time. Except, my mom made this extremely difficult for me. I was barely allowed to go to parties, go on a high school grad trip with friends, basically just do fun teenager shit with a girlfriend. Eventually, i got cheated on. So instead of changing my life for the better, i decided maybe i should find a girl who more suited my boring lifestyle. 

At 18, i found her. We were both home bodies and played video games. And despite me growing out of this stage more and more as i became an adult and my mom couldnt control me anymore, my girlfriend did not change. But because she was such a homebody, and i had really bad trust issues, i stayed with her. I told myself i can trust her, and thats whats most important. So my lifestyle revolved around this girl. She was controlling, manipulative, and so many decisions i made in life were not my own. i was unhappy for the last 3 years of the relationship but i stayed anyways. I find this partly because i was unable to make a hard decision. Because my mom controlled me for so much of my life and did everything for me and treated me like a child, I felt like i was unable to make hard decisions. Until last year where i finally broke things off. 3 years too late. 

Once i did this, i really started to grow as a person. I moved out on my own, became more independent and was finally learning to be an individual. For the first time in my adult life. I had so many things planned for this year. A europe trip with my boys, no serious relationship, just do the casual thing for a while. Im a good looking guy i wasnt worried. But then the pandemic hit. And everything i wanted to do to help me grow as an individual had come to a halt. I was stuck inside doing nothing all day, doing the exact thing i ran away from at home. 

So naturally, i downloaded tinder. Cause i was lonely. I found this amazing girl who ive started dating (i know, dating during a pandemic, sue me. But shes the only person i really ever see so im not going crazy or anything). And i love her. She is everything ive ever wanted in a relationship. We get along really well and whenever im with her, im really happy. 

Except, when im not with her, im depressed. Because even though i love her, i dont love myself. I feel like i shorted myself. I told myself i wouldnt get into a relationship again until i tried everything i needed to on my own. 

In contrast, shes lived life the right way. She never had a LTR. Shes 22, im 24. She had fun as a teenager, she did really cool things, she was a top athlete in her sport, going around north america playing that sport. Being independent, not being in relationships. Doing the casual thing. Going to cool parties. She is so sure and confident in herself, and im really envious of that. When shes not with me, shes not depressed, anxious, or unsure of her life. Shes lived life. Good and bad. And i think shes more ready for something serious than I thought i was. I really truly think shes such a cool person and am so envious of her life before me. 

And now, i dont know what to do. To no fault of hers, i feel like no matter what i do, i cant get rid of these insecurities i have while being in a relationship. I’ve spent my whole life living how other people want me to. Making decisions not because they would make only me happy, but because they would aatisfy the other person. Whether that person/people are my parents, exes, whatever. Its never just been about me. 

This girl isnt controlling, and doesnt manipulate me into doing anything. But she is serious about this, and us, and its starting to scare me because of my mental state. What if i decide i want to pack up and move half way across the world? What if i want to quit my job and just travel for a year? These are decisions ive never been able to make for myself, by myself, and im realizing that now. And it would be so unfair of me to make those decisions at this point without considering how she might feel. She probably doesnt want that. She cant do that. She wants to find a full time job, work. Be serious. Because shes had her fun. 

I havent. Its always been serious for me. And im scared of falling into the same hole i fell in years ago. Im unfortunately back at home now, because financially it makes sense. I work from home so paying 1200 in rent each month for a tiny condo is hard for me to justify. So here i am, in a serious relationship, at home. Doing nothing all day. The exact problem i thought i solved a year ago. Im falling apart mentally,  i cant get rid of these thoughts or insecurities. It keeps me up at night. I cant focus on anything. I feel so inadequate. I feel like such a loser. And im just having such a hard time, because i can see a future with this girl. I just dont see a future where i dont feel the way i do now. And i feel like eventually, i may grow resentful towards her. I dont know.",20Dec2020,1

149,"I am very lonesome man, an introvert by choice and don't really have or had much friends in life. I never wanted it and never really missed on not having a social life. I had a ton of issues in life that I needed to work on and I didn't have adults to help me with them when I was young. So, I never really learned to trust or share my life with anyone at any age. 

Today I am 27 and was introspecting my life and I realized that without sex, I don't really care for a relationship. Probably, when I was younger I accounted this for my age then and never really worked on it. But, as I grew older I learned how to be in healthy relationships which is a big deal for me because I was born in a toxic home and was getting myself in toxic relationships and I was personally toxic too in the past and I wanted that to change. The part of my life that I have a choice in, I wanted it to be for my best.  

My recent relationship was the most healthiest one I ever had in my life. It ended last month, lasted over a year and we never had a toxic moment; it was an achievement or a life goal come true for me. When she broke up with me, I wasn't sad (I should have been) but instead I just moved on. That's when I realized that I don't seek for a relationship if I am not in need for a sexual partner. 

Now, this is the interesting part, I am sexually numb. Sex is more of a compulsive act for me, I don't personally enjoy it. I have never felt even a kiss. I just want that high of making my partner cum and then cum after her. My father raped me when I was 5 and that was my first ever sexual encounter and back then I didn't know what sex was. But, as far as I remember it I didn't enjoy him or even was aware what he was doing and it wasn't that often either. Also, it happened 22 years ago. 

I believe I have all the right ideals for a relationship in my head. I have worked over the past years of my life on emotional maturity, financial independence, communication skills, being proactive, choosing risk free sex life, making sure that I don't make decisions with my member and worked on everything that my parent's never worked on in their marriage. I did all those to hopefully one day wake up and tell myself that I didn't become like them. But, here's the punchline; emotionally, physically and spiritually I can't connect with human beings other than for satisfying a meaningless compulsion for my sexual gratification.",20Dec2020,1

154,"I have never felt more insecure about myself than I have in this past year. I have never felt more lonely. I have come to hate the way I look. I was looking at pictures from my time last year at university and I saw how fucking happy I looked in them. And now I can’t stand to look at myself.
I think I have distanced myself from everybody and I feel like my parents don’t like me as much because I always get into some kind of argument. Lately it feels like I have been the responsible one and my parents have acted like a child when it comes to managing finances. 

I have been hating the way I look. I have not taken much pictures of myself since I think I am too fat or unattractive. I feel like Every day is worse than the day before. When I feel like I can’t get any more miserable I wake up the next day and feel miserable. And that leads me to feel even more insecure about myself and it has really affected the relationship I have with my parents. I love them but I feel like I have been horrible towards them. 

I am also really upset about the fact that my parents never really tend to celebrate my achievements. I graduated with highest honors this year and landed myself a great job. There was no special celebration whatsoever. I passed all four parts of the CPA exam which was an incredibly hard thing to accomplish and literally no celebration. It hurts even more because I see my friends celebrating the very same accomplishments with their family and their family is so much more excited about it.

I hate that every time my parents sees a tv show or a movie they comment on 
how beautiful the actress is. EVERY SINGLE FUCKING TIME AND I HATE THAT. Everyday I see my parents passing comments about someone they know who is modeling now or one of my friend on Facebook who looks extremely beautiful and I am not jealous of that. It just makes me sad how they appreciate that much more than how extremely ducking hard I have worked to get a degree and land myself a job so that I could support them. Sometimes my dad treats me like an ATM machine. While I was at university he has approximately used about 10 grand of my earnings all of which I had saved from my internship and summer job.

156,"**TRIGGER WARNING - SELF HARM, DEPRESSION, ATTEMPTED SUICIDE**

&amp;#x200B;

So, Ive struggled with many mental health issues such as clinical depression, anxiety (in many forms), dysphoria, and low self worth since I was 12. I would do horrible things to my body and I stopped taking care of myself as a punishment.

Now Im 16, and Its 2am on a really hot summers night with a fan blasting cold air onto my skin and I put some music on and I just burst out crying because.... I feel alive, and I don't feel numb or in pain. Tonight has just been a reminder of how far I've come. I want to look at 13 year old me that cut herself and didnt eat for a day and overate the next, who cried herself to sleep, the girl who felt so like she had to kill herself for anyone to even see her, that everything will change and that it takes time and tears and long nights. I wanna tell her that it's worth everything, that she doesn't have to leave this world for someone to appreciate you. 

The cold air on my skin feels like freedom, the tears that roll down my face as I write this are bittersweet because they are welcome. because I hold myself tightly and laugh. because I am learning to love my body and because I am finding my own person, and although I am not fully recovered I know that i will fight everyday to meet this wonderful person I see in the mirror.  I look in the mirror and talk to myself like a crazy person, I laugh with myself and I hug myself, because you know what, i spent years tearing, burning and scratching my skin, and now I have to teach myself to love it.

I have really bad sensory overload, it's gotten to the point multiply times where I physically can't get the words together to talk. The part that sets it off the worse is people saying things multiply times to me. Stuff like getting instructions multiply times or hearing the same thing multiply times makes me get very frustrated with people. It just gets to the point where I answer with a very short ""ok"" or ""sure"" to whatever they say. Ever since I tried getting off zoloft it's just been getting worse, especially around my mom. She often repeats instructions multiply times to people which dosent fit in well with my problem. It gets really bad while driving because she'll tell me multiply times in a few seconds to do something and I end up snapping at her and then she just tells at me for 20 or so minutes about it.

160,"Hey guys!

So last week, I had my first major panic attack. Never felt anything like it before. Before last week, I was very energetic and unbothered by my issues. Felt normal and good in other words.

But last week brought all that to a halt. And after that, for a few more days I began feeling very anxious. It was all a constant and continuous anxiety fueled sensation in the form of a heavy feeling on my chest and breathing. During that time, I seeked help and after finding out my health and asthma was fine, I spoke to a therapist who gave me the option of taking medication. I accepted. And after speaking to them in another session and venting about some issues, I felt instantly better. To the point where the last few days, the anxiety could be considered almost gone. I no longer worry about another panic attack. Nor the heaviness in my chest. And I decided to not take the medication since my therapist also said it doesn't seem like I need them long-term.

But here's the catch. When I'm not distracted or feeling well, which admittedly does happen sometimes during the day which is good, I feel a sense of apathy. Not sadness. But not happiness. I don't get excited about my games or shows like I used to. I just feel like I'm rolling with the motions which sucks. Due to that, I began taking the medication (Zoloft) two days ago. But I feel like it kinda worsened my mood. Hasn't allowed me to sleep well and I've noticed I feep much emptier. Which is why I stopped taking it today.

So until I speak to my therapist again, I decided to ask if this was normal? For anxiety to suddenly appear but then go away? Only for it to be replaced by bouts of apathy? Could it be due to the winter? During the spring and summer, I'm the opposite of this. Very cheerful and so on.

Any input is appreciated! And thank you!",20Dec2020,1

165,"Hey, this is my first post on here, something happened today and i’m pretty freaked out and scared and i’m hoping someone has gone through something similar and maybe knows what could help or what this is called so i can do some research on the topic.

Im 21 and i’ve had a rough couple of months last year and fell into a pretty big depression and for the last 6 months things have gotten better and have been trying to figure out if the depression had left and I was just dealing with some leftover symptoms or if I was still going through the depression even though my overall life situation had improved.

I started going to gestalt therapy about a month and a half ago but I couldn’t feel a real difference, but I just figured it would take some time.

Last week’s session was the hardest one I’ve had for sure, did some visualizations to try to relate my feelings with certain body parts and see how they react with eachother and when I had to pay attention to my stomach (turns out I feel most of my emotions either in my stomach or my chest) I saw it as if it was vacuum packed, brown and in a really bad state overall and when my therapist asked me what I would feel like saying to it, all I could say was “You better suck it up, you better keep working through this, everything is really shit right now and I need you to work. I wish I could do more for you but right now I can’t help you”, and we related this to some things that I’ve had to say to myself in the past when going through tonight times.

Either way, my therapist asked me to pay attention to my stomach throughout this week until my next session, see what I notice. And even though the session was really tough, i’ve been having pretty normal days. 

This morning I woke up, went to have breakfast with some friends (i live in spain so we can do this rn with some restrictions) and when i got home, made some coffee for my boyfriend as a surprise since he had just woken up and got into bed to just chill and cuddle.

Then slowly I started to feel kind of weird, like emotionally numb but also kind of sad, I told him about it (he’s well aware of my mental health lately and he supports me a lot), so he asked me if I wanted some space or if he should stay, so I asked him to leave me alone for a bit so I could have some time to myself and see if it would pass. 

Then I just basically started spiralling and thinking a lot of negative thoughts about myself and how I’m not doing enough to achieve the things I want, about how I’m truly not happy and just generally bad stuff, and feeling both super sad and really numb at the same time.

After a while my boyfriend came back in to cuddle with me, asking me how I was doing and trying to figure out what I want, how he could help and what I wanted to do, but at this point I couldn’t even speak anymore (this happens when I get in this state but he can usually coax me out of it), then I just started crying and freaking out very quietly, I started biting my finger and the cover in a very anxious manner (i don’t think he could tell as I had turned my back to him and he was hugging me from behind). I was just jumping from crying and lowkey freaking out to feeling incredibly numb and getting really scared at how I was spiraling and being unable to show it or express it or talk about it. 

Then I started feeling a kind of depersonalization that I hadn’t felt in a really long time (when I was going through the hardest part of my depression I used to depersonalize a lot and it hasn’t been happening for a good 5 months) I got quite scared and sat up, my body started cramping up and I began to hyperventilate and get really scared, my boyfriend started trying to calm me down, trying to get me to breathe and at one point I closed my eyes and kind of felt like i was falling while my body was separating from myself and it scared the living shit out of me. 

I was panicking at all the things I was feeling and experiencing at once (my biggest fear since I was little is going crazy or losing my mind and not being aware of myself so mental health is a big big deal for me).

Finally after a couple minutes my boyfriend was able to calm me down and then I just sat there for about 30 minutes in disbelief, sadness and fear of what my brain just made me go through. Meanwhile my boyfriend was trying to talk about things with me, trying to get my mind off of things. 

Eventually I forced myself out of that state cause I could feel like I wasn’t getting anywhere but since this happened I feel like I’ve seen a part of me that’s been trying to hurt me, like a really evil “energy” it even feels like a presence and now that I’ve recognized it I feel like it’s inside of me watching everything i do it think or feel and it’s just waiting to fuck me up again, and I’m terrified of going to sleep and letting it get to me and spiraling again. 

I don’t believe in this sort of stuff, I know this is something that’s in my mind, but I can’t shake the feeling and it’s really creeping me out. I’ve never imagined or felt anything like this ever before,I’ve only ever gone through depression, anorexia and self harm, and this right know feels fucking terrifying. 

I just need someone to tell me if you know what this is, if I can shake this feeling, if you’ve gone through something similar or whatever, I have therapy on wednesday and I don’t think I can handle feeling this way till then.

I take antidepressants “serotonin inhibitors” so ...why is this happening? All I want to do is sit on my couch for days and weeks and just draw. I feel like I’m deteriorating. 
PS: I live in a place where it’s okay to socialise with other people and go out you just have to wear a mask.",20Dec2020,1
174,"I'm crying constantly. I'm not happy. 

I was meant to visit my grandma the other week but didn't, because I'd been miserable for a couple of days and didn't feel like it. I got home after college and mum asked why I wasn't at grandma's. I'd been feeling ok until then, until she told me that I should fake being happy, and I need to stop being miserable and find a way to fix it. 

You can bet I felt fucking fantastic after that.

I'm currently working on Christmas presents. It's so slow and time is moving too quickly and my stupid fucking perfectionist brain is telling me it's all shit and I need to do better and do stuff quicker. My bf (who the gift is for) told me to not bother if it's putting this much stress on me, but then I'll feel so very guilty like I always do.

Literally as I'm writing this, mum just came in to have a chat and gave me a solution that I don't want because it isn't what I wanted this to be and it isn't something I picture bf liking. This isn't going the way I wanted it to and I fucking hate myself. I should've done this and that and everything different, it's my fault it's all going sideways. I just want to crumple everything and give up on it and curl up and cry and not talk to anyone in this shitty goddamn house again.

Like I feel empty and not complete if there is not some kind of sad thing to think about, feel, or experience.

177,"I have been visiting this sub to give advice and support for several years now, and I wanted to share some of my findings.

So far I have received positive feedback from 1500+ comments, and have read many stories involving a wide variety of mental and social problems that people have courageously decided to share.

I have also included a few relevant links below. :)

&amp;#x200B;

**1) Stigma**

Unfortunately, stigma towards mental health problems has existed throughout all of history, and still exists to this day. Fortunately, things do seem to be changing for the better, slowly but surely.

The important thing to realise is to not take any stigma or judgments from others personally. It is either coming from a place of ignorance, or they may just lack empathy. Speak your truth honestly and courageously, and if others decide to stigmatise or discriminate against you, then that is there problem, and not yours.

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Talking to others**

A common theme is the fear of disclosing mental health problems to others or not knowing how to talk about it to family, friends, or even your therapist.

Your mental health is important and you are allowed to discuss it with others, especially if you trust them or believe they may be able to help or support you.

You should never feel ashamed of having a mental health disorder, as long as you are trying your best to understand and manage it.

If one parent is not responding well, try the other. If neither are, try talking to your most trusted friend. If that fails, then you should consider speaking with a doctor who should guide you in the right direction.

Here are a couple of good articles on talking to others about mental health:

* [https://www.buzzfeed.com/annaborges/how-do-i-tell-my-parents-i-need-mental-health-help](https://www.buzzfeed.com/annaborges/how-do-i-tell-my-parents-i-need-mental-health-help)
* [https://psychcentral.com/blog/6-ways-to-open-up-and-talk-in-therapy](https://psychcentral.com/blog/6-ways-to-open-up-and-talk-in-therapy)

&amp;#x200B;

**3) Responsibility**

What many people do not realise, or do not want to admit to, is that taking care of their mental health is primarily their responsibility. Your parents, friends, coworkers, and therapist may help and support you, but ultimately your mental health (similar to your physical health) is still your responsibility.

If you do not want to heal or change, then you almost definitely will not, and in the end you will be the one that suffers the most, so it is important that you prioritise and take care of your mental health as best you can.

&amp;#x200B;

**4)** **Habits**

Your habits are really important. Often, the difference between those who's mental health starts to improve and those who's mental health begins to decline is their habits. It is not always easy to switch from bad habits to good ones, but at the very least you should become aware of them and begin to change them when you can. 

* Examples of good habits: regular exercise, getting enough sleep, socialising, positive thinking, creativity, balanced diet.
* Examples of bad habits: smoking, alcohol, drugs, not enough sleep, procrastinating, self harm, ruminating, negative thinking, unbalanced diet, overeating.

She doesn’t like the medication, doesn’t believe it’s december, doesn’t believe people close to her are who they say they are, and also doesn’t think covid is real (totally unlike her) I’m scared. I never ever ever thought she’d have these intense of mental illnesses. Plus doesn’t help our family is Italian american and she was raised to not believe in mental health.

180,"I have been in DBT for about 7 months now, with a group class each week and individual sessions with my therapist.

I really don't think it is for me. Some of the skills seem silly for me and are not very effective. Naming my emotions, calling them a thought, pretending my emotions as a cloud or conveyer belt and watching them travel away.

I feel my leveling of coping is above this. I have tried implementing skills and using them when I feel distressed, and they just don't do it.

The only one that I feel has really made any difference is STOP (which when it comes to my target behavior it is useless. So far nothing has been able to prevent my target behavior impulses), TIP (jumping in a cold shower and massive amounts of deep breathing)

TIP doesn't help with stopping the invasive thoughts, it only distracts my mind until the thought squeezes back in.

I have never had any success with being mindful. My mind is constantly multitasking. My thoughts race, focus is non-existent, and I have yet to be successful in thinking of just one thing.

I am not sure if DBT is something that is for me and my mind. Does anyone else feel this way when it comes to DBT skills and being mindful? I am on the verge is quitting, but I don't want to be a quitter.

I know I need the help, just not sure which part of DBT will work",20Dec2020,1

182,"They are fu**ing disgusting. I hate him now more than ever for this reason. I once walked past their room and it was open and he was half naked only underwear on. Greeting me with a smile.

Its a nightmare when my mom asks me to prepare their room for them. I know and she knows what they are gonna do.

My room is literally next to theirs. I can hear them, clearly. And after they got the attic room, it disgusts me when they run up the stairs and he spanks her thinking no ones around because everybody is asleep. Im not..

She always shouts on me for not interacting with him. Hes effing 52.. shes 36. He cheated on his wife with her. And hes using ber for her body because he has the money thus the power!

I curl up in my bed crying and screaming into my pellow after hearing them, hearing her moaning like that.. knowing he married her after only 3 dates because he has the money for it, hearing the bed squeaks, the giggles, the spanks, the fucking moans, I hold my hair almost tearing it all whenever I recall them, whenever I remember them, cry, scream, no one to talk to about cause were religious.

She calls me autistic, stupid, depressed, kid, useless, because I refuse to meet him when he visits us, and hide in my room for the entire day just not to see his face. And that THAT ""makes him sad""; because ""he feels like he dont fit in, since whenever he comes over you fucking hide in your room! and even when your sitting with us! your not even talking to him or giving him any attention and burrying your face in those lame books!""

I cant tell her that I dont like him because, I dont have a reason. The man is great, respectful and he helped us a lot. There is literally no reason for me to hate him to give as an excuse. 

I dont know how to tell her that I hate him.
She always asked me if I dont feel right with him, I said no, because Iv never seen her happy like this before. And if shes happy then Im happy. But I cant keep pretending anymore.. hearing them doing it is driving me crazy, im so disgusted.

maybe hearing others storries will bring me peace.
iv tried everything really,the only thing left is to confront them. thatd be hard because were religious and these things are hush-hush topics, also, telling them I could hear the spanking the moaning and giggles?

I cant.. itll be more awkward for them but.. I dont have the courage yet.
I might need to remind myself that im not alone.. its why im reading the stories here, I also need some supoort.. Thank you ❤",20Dec2020,1
183,"Since I was little, my dad never really was around.. I never really liked him. 
When I was teen  he used to lock me in my room and always get angry for no reason ...

My parents got divorced  
And all my 26 years he never really talked to me.. only at my birthday. He gave all his attention to my little brother 
I guess he wanted a son 

Lately he keep calling me 
At first I was trying to be polite  and answered 
But it got worse and worse 
He kept calling more and more and I stopped answering.. 

My mental health cant take this .. Im not used to a father .. and he think that he can just call me and talk like nothings wrong.. I cant take it

I hate exercising, it's a chore and not fun at all. It gets worse when I do it with other people, I'm only ashamed when I can't keep up and get very, very angry with myself.

186,"I’m (19F) and I want to drive so I’ve been practicing with my father for 6 months on separate days and all went smoothly and well, so my father decided I could drive in public roads so he can see if I’m can do everything correctly. 
Few weeks went by, my driving was OK didn’t make any accidents but I did make some mistakes, like, driving too fast on the road bumps and wrong positions and such small things like that. But there was days that the last 5 days has been the worst, it’s like I’ve forgotten everything and I almost crushed the car on the wall and I don’t recall seeing the wall any ways! The next thing I know that my body was really hot and my head pounding and my eye sight was blur for seconds and I managed to step on the brakes on time. It was like I went blind, then I went to highway, there was separate roads so father told me to go the 3rd one, I went to 4th road he got mad and yelled at me and told me what’s wrong with me these days like It’s the first time I’m driving.
Then on the same day I almost crushed two cars on different roads and my head was pounding again, I told my father to switch with me so he can drive instead of me but he got mad and said to continue, i didn’t insist so i continued driving feeling stupid and embarrassed until we returned home.
And I’ve been misspell words when I say it out loud, can’t focus for too long and I can’t tell what am I saying, like, I’m talking to someone online and they always say they don’t understand me and I forgot what I said so go check what I said and see that I’ve made a mess, a lot with misspellings and wrong grammar and word mispositions,
Should I seek medical help/go to psychiatric or it’s just normal thing everyone have been through it too?


And I won’t lie, I’m angry with my father, because he was angry at someone and poured his anger at me and splashed water at me in public place in front of people, and he hasn’t apologised and thinks I don’t mind. I’m the type who stay silent when bing hurt but I protect people who in trouble and I’m keeping my feelings and stress inside, Maybe it’s why I’m like that..?",20Dec2020,1

190,"Hey all... this is fairly vent-y and serious so if this isnt the right place let me know and I'll take it down haha

Idk if anyone feels this way too but like

Im an asexual person and its been giving me a lot of anxiety lately

Im shit at living alone, I want to live with a few close loved ones (eg friends)... but everyone Im sure lives either alone or would rather live with a sexual partner (something I cant be)

Im making friends at uni finally (am 20 years old) but it seems to me that after uni they'll go on to do their own thing and just life will happen (ie theyll find a job somewhere, move to another city to stay with a partner, etc). Even if we'd still be close friends and care about each other, I might only see them like a few times a year if that (and thatd be literally my only meaningful human contact with close loved ones)

Id be left behind with no close loved ones where I lived and I wouldnt be anyones ""number one person"" if that makes sense (as a sexual partner or parent might be) and idk this idea just makes me so anxious

I feel like Id just be going to work every day, if I dont click with colleagues as many people dont thered be casual coversation and thats it, then Id go home and just pass time alone till the next day

That doesnt seem like a fulfilling or particularly... ""alive"" life to me but idk what to do about it and it makes me feel very dependent too which is scary af

Coming from a bad family and not being able to have a sexual partner means I really will be dependent on friends as my only close loved ones for my whole life and I dont know to what extent a person can even do that

I hear lots of adults talking about how its like an inevitability that  what happens with friendships as you age is that you go years w/out  seeing each other but when you do its like nothing ever happened and its  fantastic Which is nice and all but they live with loved ones in the interim I  suspect, so they always have that close human contact everyone needs",20Dec2020,1

My husband is in full support. As a physician he not only was able to look at the situation subjectively, but also objectively. 

Now, this is where I need advice: 

My parents are not fans of my husband. They our relationship as a negative. They are aware (through me) that we have been having issues. It is my fault for involving them, and it is my fault for allowing them to form such a detrimental opinion. It is also Christmas, and I am expected to be at my parent’s house... with or without him. They prefer without him. If I tell them I am seeking care then they will not only blame him, they will also claim that I show a lack of maturity and an inability to deal with life challenges. They will point to problems I had in the past with breakups and reprimand me. I will also feel guilty because I will be ruining their Christmas. 

How do I tell them that I am hellbent on going into care? To protect my sanity I would rather not call, although I do know that that is usually the best option. I wish my husband could tell them, but I’m afraid that they will blame him for pushing me in this direction or not listen to him.

They can't leave the house without the worry of becoming sensitive and becoming ill, this is obviously having a huge impact of their life and I just don't know what to do in order to support.

I don’t have much of an appetite, and I can’t eat a whole lot without feeling really, really sick afterwards. 

Are there any recommended foods to help me put on some weight? Even if I don’t eat a lot, what can I eat instead to help me get up to a healthy weight again? I do better with liquids/drinks than I do with actual solid foods as well.

I feel that this topic hasn't been discussed before in depth .But for me this is the one big problem.And i have no clue how to fix it. I'm 22 and not doing well , i feel that i have potential for much more (and a lot of people tell me that) , but i always do the thing that will bring me the most suffering and i know that.For example i've never been in a relationship, It's not like i'm ugly nor that socially akward , but every time i've had a chance to start a relationship or anything like that really i would just self sabotage myself(This is true for most aspects of my life). I even got into the incel bullshit for awhile. Got badly hurt by it , but was able to escape from the toxic enviroment .For some reason i want to be seen by others like the weird loner stoic guy .( Think of the character of Ryan Ghosling in Blade Runner , Drive or something like down).I can't go like that anymore , i feel that i'm actually going to end up really",20Dec2020,1

I tried opening up to him about how I was feeling and what I was feeling back in the day. I even mentioned im glad it was a failed attempt or I wouldn't have met him.

When I (f22) was a little kid, I was always one of the tallest girls in my class. I got my growth spurt quite early, so I always had the idea that I was just objectively tall. I was also on the heavy half of the healthy weight range, which made me feel relatively big. 

During my childhood years, I was right in seeing myself as big and tall, because I was. But then puberty began to hit my classmates and they began to grow and also got bigger. Even so most of them now are taller than me. But I still feel like a giant when I'm around people. I feel big and tall, even though most of the people around me are taller and I'm not overweight. I can't seem to see myself as 'normal', because actually that's what I am. Not tall, not short, not big, not skinny. 

All the clothes I buy are unintentionally oversized. Also because I like the fit of oversized clothes, but a big reason is because I can't imagine I fit a US size 6. When I see other people with US size 6, they seem smaller than me (which is not really true when we actually measure our waists etc) So I mostly buy like an 8 or 10 because I think that's the right size for me (aka my 'i feel like a giant'-size)

So around peers I feel like a giant, but when I'm around older adults, I feel so incredibly small (short). I can't imagine that the body I have is tall enough to carry a baby or be considered an adult size, even though when I stand next to other adults, they are nearly the same hight as me (some taller, some shorter, because like I said, I'm so average)

&amp;#x200B;

I also have derealization and it just adds to the feeling of fakeness all around me. Like, how likely could that even be? I don't know. I feel like nothing makes sense anymore.

How likely would it be thag my brother has the same thing after he's been a normal kid his whole life?

I (F18) have always struggled with a short attention span as long as I can remember, and especialy when I'm bored (such as in school) I end up daydreaming and not focusing at the lesson at all. I always procrastinate when I'm supposed to do something I find boring, like doing homework or cleaning my room, and often end up not doing it at all. I don't think I've done any homework that isn't graded since elementary school, and I'm in high school now. My parents and teachers haven't noticed since I'm a pretty fast learner, and have somehow kept  reasonable grades. 

Since I'm in my last grade of high school I have matriculation exams coming up, and I've really tried to study for them, since I know I won't pass if I don't actually study. But I just keep procrastinating, and when I finally sit down to study I keep zoning out. It's really frustrating, because when I do something fun like playing videogames or painting I can do it for hours, completly losing track of time, and even forgetting to eat at times.

I've been telling myself that I'll talk to the school counselor for over a year now, but I'm scared that I don't have ADD, and that I'm just trying to blame my laziness on something, and that the school counselor will think that I'm just seeking attention. Again, I'd really appreciate someone else's thoughts on this, thanks in advance!

214,"**Trigger warnings for suicidal ideation, terminal illness and death**

I'll try to be brief, about two years ago I (34m) was manic and desperate, and at an ultimate breaking point.  I was starting to have routine thoughts of hanging myself by my belt in the stairway at work as I sat at my desk.  I had to leave stand up meetings with my team on a few occasions, because I started tearing up.  I knew I needed help, in fact had needed help for years, and I sought out help desperately.  I pulled every counselor on my health insurance plan, and ended up calling through a list of over forty, who were all either full, or had closed.  My brother, who I lived with at the time, ended up forcing me to go to the ER with him to be evaluated.  They released me that day with a small prescription and recommended an additional list off-insurance.

That was probably the second hardest time in my life, and to be honest I'm not sure how I survived it.  Work was extremely stressful at the time (I was given one of the hardest projects our Team was undertaking, on top of my terrible emotional and mental distress), my few friendships were fraying, and I was entirely lost.

My reason for writing this is, I feel I'm heading in that direction again, and I'm not sure I'll weather things this time - Or more importantly, what can be done to increase my chances.

A few quick bullets on how I got here:
- I was widowed in 2016; My Fiancée and I had been together almost ten years, and owned a home together.  She had battled ovarian cancer her entire adult life.  I held her hand as she passed.
- I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder at age Twenty, after failing a single semester at University (I had basically become horribly depressed and secluded) and being academically dismissed
- I was also diagnosed with an acute condition of Inattentive Attention Deficit Disorder at the same time; I had been having short-term memory loss, so impactful that a neurologist thought I had a brain tumor.  They ultimately concluded that I have an underdeveloped frontal lobe (if I recall correctly, in the range of ~60% developed)
- I grew up in a fundamentally religious household, and while both my sibling and I were fortunate to grow up in relative comfort and had some social normalcy, I think we were considered socially maladapted by many of our peers.  We were those kids who were forced to spend three days a week at church (a quite traditional one at that, where some women still felt compelled to wear head coverings while men were in attendance)
- My whole life I've been extraordinarily self-effacing, self-deprecating and insecure.  One of my oldest memories was hiding in a pile of dirty laundry near the washing machine, listening to my family talk in the other room and imagining how their lives would be no different with me gone.  I was seven.

When my Fiancée passed, I became bitter and cold.  I blamed myself for her death, I blamed god, fate, or whatever other nebulous entity I could.  I moved across the country to be closer to family, during which for a moment I truly hoped I could start fresh.  Four years later, my Fiancées parents have passed, her Step-Mother due to terminal cancer, and her Father due to a drug overdose.  He had also battled Stage Four Lymphoma.  I have somehow managed to keep the new job I had taken after moving, but it's been truly difficult at times.  My brother has since moved to Grad school in another place (which I'm extremely happy for him about), though it does frighten me that I'm living alone now, in the event my condition does deteriorate as I fear it's set to do.

I spent the year of 2019 going to weekly therapy (when my job didn't interfere), as well as making checkups at county mental health services.  I was put on a few different prescriptions, but I halted them after suffering a few destabilizing bouts of additional depression while on new drugs.  I ended up at a place where the prescriptions were not helping, and my therapy was both too costly (about $1k/four one hour sessions) and not really impactful outside of learning a few important reframing and grounding techniques.

And now I'm here, I guess.  2020 was largely uneventful, which I guess is good considering the alternative.  I still feel deeply hurt, still depressed, largely lonely without many friends, and I feel like I scrape by at my job (I'm a software engineer).  It's not that I don't like what I've become - I've never liked who I am, in my entire life.  I never understood what my Fiancée saw in me, why people gave me a chance in jobs (somehow without a formal education and severe ADD I've made it this far).  I spent much of our relationship trying to support her, and I lost any brief glimpse of who I actually was.  Besides work promotions, I have never had the positive indicators others have had to motivate them - No Bachelors' diploma, no successful entrepreneurship, merits, academic or professional recognition.  I've never had a 'win,' so-to-speak.  My prospects for the future are currently not any brighter - I've learned through multiple therapists over the years, and prescriptions, that I just can't surmount this depression.

And I'm getting more and more angry at myself, and bitter at those I see in the surrounding world who have had every opportunity to live a normal life.  To have families, to have careers, to fulfill their goals and not constantly be fighting with everything they have to stay afloat.  It's certainly not my intention to take away from the struggles many hold internally, and I know I am certainly not the only person with physiological difficulties, or who has undergone serious trauma.  My heart deeply aches for every loved one of a Covid victim out there, among any other person who has lost someone.

But this is the crux - I'm keenly aware that this mindset is at best dishonest and toxic, and at worst completely destructive and shameful.  I'm not a violent person at all, and if anything I'm overly weak and accepting (something that has bothered many I've known for years).  I just don't think I'll be able to withstand another major descent into the place I was in back in 2018, which lasted nearly the whole year.  I'm just so lost, and I'm not sure what possible options are out there besides therapy (which even with good insurance and a promising counselor, I simply cannot afford now), and medication (which again, has so far only made things worse).

I apologize for the rambling nature of my post, and truly appreciate everyone who both contributes and comments in this sub.",20Dec2020,1

219,"Hey guys,

Posted this on r/depression but guess posting the rant on here would help me blow off some more steam and get some more opinions. Guess I'm too broken. I'm writing this because I don't know who to speak to, can't speak to my friends, can't speak to my family, so I'm here talking to people who may be able to understand me.

Got diagnosed with depression a year or so ago, but had it for far longer, just never went to the doctors for it. Saw a lot of shit as a kid that you guys all may have seen too, abuse, unfaithfulness, all that jazz. That lead me to not wanting to ever have kids. Doesn't help that my family were poor as fuck growing up, so I worked my damn ass off to become the best possible person I could be.

I'm 22 now, from the UK. Got into the best med school in the country, worked my ass off for that, especially since all the schools I went to were shit. Got therapy, got the medication I needed. Found a girl too, great girl, albeit had a sheltered life. She was a national championship in taekwondo or something, that doesn't matter.

Anyways, I never open up about my depression, I don't like to be a burden. She said she wanted kids, I said I didn't, and we stopped talking for a few days and said it's over. For the next few days, I had a think about everything, why I truly didn't want kids. Turned out I did want them, I was just worried that a) I'd pass on the depression to my kids because of genetics and all and b) be a horrible father because I've never had an adequate example. Anyways, I messaged her back and told her I had rethought and did want kids, and also wanted her back.

So anyways she asked me why I never originally want kids, and I decided it may be worth opening up after 22 years or so of my life about what has happened to me through my life. Told her exactly why I didn't want kids, the abuse I went through, the fucked up stuff I remember. How I didn't want to screw up a kids life. How I didn't want to bring a kid into this world. I was vulnerable, for once, with someone other than a therapist. Long story short, she said it was too much for her, that she's seen firsthand how parents with depression handle their children, how difficult it is for them to manage a child who is depressed. I felt shocked, literally felt like I was being treated like I was infectious and should never be around any young person.

I guess the reason I am writing this is because no matter what I do, no matter who I become, I'm always going to be defined by my depression. I could be the best damn doctor the planet has never seen, but I'm never, ever going to be worthy of love or children. Safe to say she fed into the exact reason I didn't want kids, and now I definitely will never be having them.

220,"Hello there, 
This may or may not be helpful but I thought I would share. 
I had a rough patch in my life where I thought of throwing in the towel, I had tunnel vision to enter that sweet void of nothingness. My mind was putting in the extra work to make me feel like I was worthless, lazy, and that there was something wrong with me. I still battle with depression and anxiety to this day but I have a much better grip on them, understanding the warning signs as they creep in. Some of these things have helped me to get back on my feet and hopefully it can help 🤞. 

The day that I just wanted to end it, instead I decided to get a meaningful tattoo (recommend getting something small or using a marker if your don’t want something permanent) that would represent that day. I got the tattoo, and now when I see it I reflect on it, if I would have followed through I wouldn’t have been able to experience this day, and then I come up with something I’m grateful for in that day. It’s a little cheesy but I feel it has helped. 
I got the tattoo and the next thing I worked on changing was my thinking. You don’t have control over how situations will play out, you don’t even have control over your body (diseases and stuff), the only thing you can control is your mind and how you are going to react to the situation. (Good book on this is The Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday) Philosophical and medical readings have helped to get a better understanding. 
Going for walks helps. Look for new experiences and explore. Nobody is better than you and you are better than no one. You can learn something new from every person you meet. 
Try not to take yourself so seriously, nobody really knows what they are doing, or what they want. We are a bunch of primates on an organic space-ship plummeting through space. Just try to enjoy this tiny blimp of time we have on this rock and make some memories. 
Hope this helps! You are all kicking ass, cheers!",20Dec2020,1
221,"Start off by saying I'm schizophrenic. Struggle with auditory hallucinations (and visual hallucinations when off certain medicine).

I had a breakdown at work yesterday and left early, for the past 3 years people have gotten to know my bright cheery side. Lately I've been having off days more frequently. I think I need medication changed but just swapped to a new psychiatrist and its the holidays so can't meet up until later.

I've been going out of my way to treat holidays special to try and brighten peoples days by dressing up. If I get one smile or laugh thats enough to fuel me for the day...at least thats what I tell myself and everyone but I don't know what that really means. When a customer gets confrontational my mind begins to shatter and I struggle to keep from crying.

In truth I shut myself in when at home and have difficulty speaking my mind. I cant look people in the eye well because the voices have me convinced everyone is judging me. I have to work with customers so I just forced myself into a position where I convinced myself I'm okay...but after today I don't think I am. 

Its like I wear a mask everywhere I go. A mirror mask where I try and reflect my expression to match the mood of everyone else. I like to believe I have a strong empathetic sense to where I can put myself in many peoples shoes and try and see from there perspective. I think its what helps with that mask forming.

Today though everything came crashing down. I couldn't hold the facade I think I've pushed myself too hard for too long. Every first thought: normal, second thought: just kill yourself, third thought: you don't want to kill yourself, fourth thought: stop looking at me WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME?! (Dressed up as a reindeer, antlers, even a tail, so of course I stood out like a sore thumb). Everyone I work with could tell something was wrong. They were concerned for me, I know, but that doesn't stop the voices from calling it pity and that they think I'm some sort of freak. When I left I felt like I couldn't breathe anymore like a noose was around my neck that I couldn't get off and everyone was just staring at me. I dry heaved when I got to the car and I just stayed there head to my knees for like 30 minutes.

Now its 5 am I've been up all night and I can't figure out who I am anymore. I keep asking myself questions. What makes me, me? Was that happy bright side all a facade? Was that the real me? I've used masks for so long throughout my life I just don't know who I am. To this day its why I have never looked for someone to date because I don't feel like I'm worthy of anyone's time. I've lost touch with what was a lie and what was the truth. 

What does it mean to be an individual and have a personality? I feel like the ""regular"" me is so boring in comparison to what I view as everyone else's normal, but even that what is ""normal""? I've kept people at a distance for so long never letting them in that I don't even know what friends are. I feel like I'm not worthy to call anyone a friend. Am I an acquaintance who has similar interests?

I'm having an identity crisis at 29 and its scaring the shit out of me. Hell I don't even think anyone is going to see this and bother reading it...I just felt I needed to bleed some of this pain into words even if it was left in the aether.

227,"I’m feeling so low right now. After almost two years of meds and going to therapy, all of a sudden I realized how much anger and hatred I still have inside of me. It’s so heavy and I’m angry at myself for still having it. I always compare myself to people, thinking things like “I fucking wish I could be that happy” and “it’s all fake anyway” or “I don’t even deserve/have the capability to be happy or love myself like that” and I know this is just a reflection of my own insecurities. Maybe I haven’t brought it up in therapy enough. But man, it’s my own fault but it’s a kick in the gut man. I don’t know where to go from here, I don’t know how to let go of this hate, this anger towards myself I unjustly pour onto others. If anyone has any advice or input I’d really appreciate it. I feel so damn angry and hopeless right now :/ thanks if you’ve read this far anyways :)",20Dec2020,1
228,"Got diagnosed for depression/anxiety but I still don’t feel like I really have it.

Idk if I just had a bad psychiatrist or something but it was basically a 30 minute phone call where they asked me some questions and then prescribed me some medication. Honestly I’m not sure what I was expecting because I knew that it would probably be exactly like what the meeting was like but it just felt too easy. 

I feel like basically any person in the world could get diagnosed with it if they wanted to. While it was a bit more complex than this, they basically just asked a couple questions and then said that I had depression and anxiety and to take the meds. I felt like they just didn’t know my situation well enough to make that sudden of a diagnosis. Also, while I didn’t lie about any of the questions, you very easily could.

This makes me question the legitimacy of my diagnosis since anyone could get a diagnosis if they wanted to or they could mis diagnose. I kinda suspect that I do have some sort of depression/ anxiety but I feel like it’s not that severe and idk if I should take the medication or not. I kinda want to take it to just try it out and see if it helps but I also wonder what would happen if I don’t need the medication but take it anyway, could it mess me up. 

Also I am seeing a therapist but i’ve only seen them for an intake session and am not seeing them again for a bit so I can’t really ask them about this. Thank you for any help!",20Dec2020,1
229,"this year, life has shafted me. 

i feel like no moment has ever been truly happy. everybody hates me. i am an embarrassment to everyone around me. i'm useless, and i'm nothing. 

i wanted to kill myself a few weeks ago at university. i didn't have enough painkillers to do anything, so i didn't. the worst thing is that i'm also too scared to kill myself because what keeps me alive is the thought of what shit people would talk about me at my funeral. if anyone would even go. if anyone would miss me. 

and now i'm at home for Christmas. and it's so much worse. all the horrible things i think in my head about whether what i'm saying isn't funny, or if it's weird, or if i'm fat and strange and useless are all said by my family, and i just can't take it. and i want to kill myself. 

but i can't bring myself to do it. because my family would be so embarrassed. 

i just don't know where i could go. i don't know where i can be happy.

Hey I don’t even know where to start but right now i feel like I’m almost at the edge, I’ve been feeling this for the longest time, basically I have these emotional cycle where I know I will feel very happy confident and wise for a few months for example, but after I will randomly feel an almost equal amount of time the total opposite, for no damn reasons, I’ve interpreted it as me molting of my skin and becoming this new me, new character that I know and seen but was away for holidays, I’m an empty shell where different people slip inside to act in. like a seed that grows a tree that grows a fruit that make a seed, and the cycle repeats. But few times ago it has become so much more intense and I’m having trouble being ok with this changes, now I come from being incredibly sad manic and hysterical, to bored out of my mind and not be able to feel or care about anything, to being incredibly self aware wise and composed, and this change is starting to affect my relationship and myself of course, I keep feeling traumatised loosing sleep or all my ways over the smallest things and I can’t get professional help due to paper and dumb shit, I don’t know how to get help anymore and I’m actually contemplating attempting ending myself just so I can get actual help, because no one listens no one takes it seriously, I need real help but maybe I’m overreacting and being delusional over what I feel, nothing feels real anyways, it’s all foggy boring and I never feel awake, I want to wake up from this dream because it’s not a fun dream and I’m getting tired of being asleep, I got too much going on does this post even matter, literally just text on a screen I will probably regret writing this or I will be banned I don’t know",20Dec2020,1

233,"People just bounce off of me. No one sticks. No one reaches out. And in the past year (graduated high school, started uni online, not being able to meet anyone, quarantined) I’ve realized that I’ve pretty much lost all the friendships I had in school. Thing is, I didn’t even want them to last. I wanted to start over in college. But still, I can’t help but be hurt by this. All those years in school and not a single lasting friendship? What does that say. 

Maybe things will feel better once college actuallyy starts, not just online. For now I just feel so fucking boring. And annoying. And all the reasons why someone wouldn’t wanna befriend. It’s dumb. I’m not that bad. But I’m so bland. There’s nothing cool or interesting about me. Ok that’s not true either. But many times that’s how I come off. I mean, I still think I am pretty fucking boring, but when I feel low, I just become the most boring thing on earth. Which makes me feel even worse, and becomes a self-feeding cycle. Then when I feel good and come up for a breather, I feel AMAZING. And I notice people around me react better to me. Big part of what I notice might be in my head because I just feel better. But it’s really real, not sure to what extent. But then one tiny negative thing I think I notice in an interaction, and I go back into this cycle of “no one likes me” -&gt; become weird af -&gt; more bad interactions -&gt; “no one likes me”.

A body you imagine to transform into when you’re feeling bad. It’s a coping mechanism for me but I can’t find much information about it. It sounds similar to kinning, but I feel like it’s a little different, because it’s more about feeling strong and safe rather than relating to a character or person. And it’s more like activating a shield, or a sanctuary, despite being in public, personally, I feel like no one can really see me.

Feels like hot ice

Smells like stale air

Sounds like all that you are

And looks out from deep within 


It's inexplicable… we're the only creatures 'intelligent' enough to think ourselves into a state of near - or simulated - cardiac arrest. 

F*ckin good does that do?

I've just been on the floor for an hour clutching my chest, tears, muscle spasms… 

A chain becomes a sheet becomes a wave becomes the little death. One thought started a cascade of worry that eventually floored me.

These things are memories.. figments.. possibilities. They are mostly beyond my control now, so there's nothing I can do about them. I am but a leaf in this hurricane. Every second a clone of myself. 

And yet I experienced a fear response so strong that I physically became.. well, food if this sh*t was for real. 

Because for a brief second, my emotional connection to these often forgotten pieces of myself was so strong that my brain became convinced that it could do something to alter these flashes IF the need was great enough. 

But it can't, despite great need indeed.
It's just 8ounces of nature's electronics, plugged into a meat robot.

I have tried to control it and it might have worked for a bit, but i always go back to overthinking. It can be about a person, situation or myself. It is as if my mind is constantly searching for what it wants and the answers it want which are always negative :( 

I always expect the worst instead of seeing it from several perspectives and my brain cannot accept that i wont always know the truth at this moment and find closure.

245,"Hi all, 

My first post here. 

I've been single for many years due to a personality disorder, my mood swings are constant daily so I find it hard to maintain relationships/friendships. Most of these have been affected due to my mental health.

Recently I've been on dating apps looking for someone, but talking to them online is fine but when it comes to meeting in person I'm fine until the day comes. Once the day has arrived I start getting cramps in my stomach, I start to feel sick and get the feeling like I need to poo. I start sweating and my heart feels like its gonna explode out of my chest. This then leads me to cancelling and then it's a repeated circle.

Is there anything I can do to prevent this?

My sleep schedule is so messed up and I just can't seem to fix it because every time I manage to wake up at an earlier time, at that moment I subconsciously tell myself to go back to sleep because there is no point in waking up and the vicious cycle starts again. I just feel horrible and every day I barely do anything but binge-watch Netflix and avoid thinking about my life, I eat and go back to sleep. Even showering seems like such a hard thing to do and all I want to do is to lay down and not move. I don't have the mood to talk to my friends either and I constantly reply to texts late even though I've already seen it earlier from my notifications. When I laugh after a funny joke in shows or videos I somehow have to immediately frown again because it was so tiring to keep smiling. I just feel like I'm so lazy and I bet that's what everyone around me thinks as well. I have so many recordings of online classes I have yet to rewatch because I slept through all of my classes. I also feel like I'm always going to cry and it'll be over the smallest things. I've also been avoiding social media because I hate seeing stories and posts about the lives of my friends. I absolutely hate it and it always makes me nervous when I open the apps because I might see something that triggers my bad emotions again. I guess I'm also just jealous that they're all happy and can seem to function normally while I can't.

252,"Ok so basically, for a couple of months I've been dealing with contamination OCD that's torn my life apart. I can't live day-to-day life normally anymore, nor can I eat or drink regularly. My mom seems to think I'm doing it for the sole purpose of pissing her off. And I often find myself torn between things like - 'If I use too much soap mom will get pissed, but if I don't use a lot im gonna be really agonized for a while.' Sounds weird, i know, but it makes a lot more sense to me and im sure others with the same thing. But another thing is my mom's outbursts are really terrifying. For example, she'll threaten to send me away or take me to the hospital regularly. And then one minute she'll be comepletely fine, and the next she'll be going apeshit on my ass about the most random things. She is also my only guardian. Well i have my father who has half of my custody, but he never requests to have me (probably for the better oh boy lemme tell you) I assume it's because he's incredibly financially unstable and he doesnt want me to see him like that. Hes also actively manipulative and really just straight up fucked. Hes also often intoxicated which leads him to be aggressive and psychologically abusive. Which means if my mother disowns me, i have a chance of going with him, and it will hardly be any more desiresable. I know that I cant keep living with my mother because she obviously has some problems and is evidently bi-polar though she hasnt been clinically diagnosed. (I swear our family is a myriad of mental disorders lmao) I often find myself debating suicide because its an easy out, but at the same time i dont want to die. its just that i feel like i dont have a choice.   


So ultimately what I'm asking is this; should i leave my mother, and if so, how?   


A factor to take into account is that im only 13; so im not old enough for emancipation. im also wondering if maybe im overreacting? maybe im just chilling in self pity so much that i cant see that my situation isnt all that bad? At least i have my bro, but he will probably move out soon so that aint long term. okay at the time of writing this he just told me he goin to college soon so oh boy.
