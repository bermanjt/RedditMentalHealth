0,"Hey.  I’ve been struggling very much lately, and I’m wondering if I need to admit myself to a hospital, but I have nowhere else to go to and ask.  So, if you could please help me out and leave a comment on my situation, that would be very much appreciated.  [TW for talk of sh]

I am 14 years old, and have been dealing with self harm issues for around 2-3 years, and have been cutting for about a year.  Last September, I was admitted to a hospital for having command hallucinations, self harm issues, depression, and major anxiety problems.  It had gotten very very bad, and my stay helped for a while.  

But recently, I relapsed.  I have been cutting every night for about a week now, and each night it’s gotten worse.  I can’t bring myself to stop, and although I’ve gotten rid of sharps multiple times, I still find ways to cut.  I’m depressed, and I’m starting to feel suicidal again.  I attempted in November, and I’m worried that something like that will happen again if I don’t seek help.  My anxiety is also acting up again, but it’s not as bad as it used to be.  I used to have 2-3 panic attacks a day, now it’s just a few each week.  So I don’t know if I’m considered to be “sick enough” to admit myself into another facility.  

I seriously can’t stop hurting myself, and my brain won’t let me seek help for it.  I feel like if I tell anyone or attempt to reach out, something bad will happen.  I’ve been so anxious over this, and I’m starting to lose all hope for myself.  I think that I might get very bad again, very soon. 

Now that I write it out, it’s concerning me.  But I don’t know if it’s time for hospitalization yet??  And how would I even go about asking my mom about placement?  I don’t want to tell her everything that’s been happening...",21Jan2020,1
1,"every day is a repeat of the one before. i feel so lost, like i’ve never accomplished anything. i don’t know who i am or what i need to do to feel complete. i just want to give up so fucking bad instead of trying every day for something that isn’t working out. my family is trying their best and i love them but i’m tired. so damn tired. i have no one but my family and it’s gotten to the point where i don’t feel like depending on them anymore. it’s like i’m on life support or something and i’m too scared to just pull the plug. i don’t want my mom to be hurt. i don’t want my siblings to be hurt or my grandpa or dad or aunts and uncles. it would be selfish of me, but i’m so close to crossing the line. when i was younger all i had was motivation and aspirations.. i don’t know what happened. i don’t know what i want anymore. what is my purpose? i don’t have a big dream, i don’t want marriage or kids, i don’t have any hobbies serious or unique enough to build a career off of. i don’t have any talents, i’m not that smart.. i could go on. and all i’m
told is that it’ll get better and one day i’ll get back on track and just expand and become better but.. i’ve been waiting. i’ve been waiting for years and i’ve heard the same thing over and over, how do i know this time is the one? it’s not. i don’t know where i’m going with this stupid post. whatever.",21Jan2020,1
2,I live in Canada and Im 15 years old. I just feel like I need help. I feel sick and I need to be fixed. I want to go to the doctor and tell them that i need to go to a mental hospital. But im scared of what will happen to my future career. Since it will go in my record people might not want to hire me. Im scared that this will hurt my career and the possibility of me getting anywhere in life. But I still NEED help. Idk what to do. Someone please help me.,21Jan2020,1
3,"GO PLACIDLY amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.

Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.

Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.

Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.

Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.

Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass.

Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.

Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.

Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.

And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.

- Max Ehrmann 

Read, then read again. THEN read once more. Repeat until your soul accepts the truths it's hearing. You ARE a child of the universe. NO LESS than the trees and the stars. The world IS unfolding as it should and you DO have a purpose. STRIVE TO BE HAPPY.",21Jan2020,1

I am very open about my experiences as I feel it helps others feel less alone and it helps me cope.

8,"I just really want confirmation that I’m being paranoid because I feel scared. This might be a long thread, so this all started in 12th grade when I suddenly had a disturbing intrusive thought while with friends and began thinking people could read my mind after one of the girls in the group gave me a disgusted look. I’m always afraid I’m my intrusive thought out loud or people can hear my thoughts and now it’s to the point where I don’t feel comfortable anywhere I go unless I’m alone. Now I’m starting to feel this out of body feeling where I’m in the world by myself and everyone is a simulation or I’m on a list of people to be warned about because of my intrusive thoughts. I feel whenever someone looks at me they think I’m disgusting even though I’m disgusted by these intrusive thoughts. I feel like my family is trying to keep this secret from me and a lot of the people I know disassociate with me because they know. I’m scared and I don’t know what to do, I want to cry, scream, run away. I feel like I’m going crazy , please help",21Jan2020,1
9,"Since I was about 11 years old, I have struggled with eating/body image. It started off as I would only eat one apple every day, or, just nothing at all. I never stopped myself unless I was really truly hungry. Basically, I got over it. Didn't deal with any of those issues ages 13 and 14. Recently, within the past year, I have felt it come back more and more. My parent happened to notice I had reminders set for me not to eat on my phone. You know what they did? Try to help? No. At least worry? Nope. They got angry. Then proceeded to tell all their friends without my consent, make fun of me, and accuse me of attention seeking.  It was never about the attention though, so that's what I don't understand. This is a battle within MYSELF. I am so afraid to talk about any of it, and also afraid to tell my doctor. How do I help myself for the next 2 years of my stay in hell? I have no idea what to do and I feel trapped completely.",21Jan2020,1

11," Just realized that I was supposed to register for the exams of all my college classes yesterday. I can't stand up for myself to go whatever place I need to go and tell them I forgot to register for my exams. I can't lose 1 whole semester worth of work to some unnecessary circumstances. I'm already fucking behind in my studies. I'm mentally capable of understanding the concepts of my studies. It's just a bit hard to do anything when you're going through depressive episodes that make you starve yourself for days in a row. Sometimes I'm not even in the mental state for remembering the plot of a cartoon series for kids. My BMI is down to like 17. I'm not good at doing anything except for mental labor, seriously you don't want me to do manual labour - I'm the most clumsy person on earth. I actually was told by career advisors that nobody will employ me for anything similar to the public service sector. So in order to potentially get a decent job in the future I HAVE to finish my studies at college. And I'd be willing to do it but depression and social anxiety and the lethargy that accompanies depression makes it fucking hard. I'm giving up after 10 years of struggling with depression, social isolation and social anxiety. The worst part is the I haven't even seen a therapist for my problems and even if I did, I'd most likely still get kicked out of college.",21Jan2020,1

13,"It's funny how your brain can make you loathe yourself huh? 

Let me say first and foremost that I will never hurt anyone... that being said today out of the blue I started thinking of ways to hurt those around me... details like where I would do it. What I would use what I would say... and then the thought of how I would feel afterwards... and this is what keeps me from acting on it... because I know I don't want to... the thought just randomly popped into my head and I ran with it... I am not a danger to those around me so please don't think I am... I can already say that therapists and medications don't help me and I'm cool with that because ever since I stopped taking medication and seeing therapists I've never had these types of thoughts... this is a one time thing that I'm sure will pass... in fact it feels like it is already. I'm not really looking for advice so much as I just wanted to write it down and get people's opinions on what's going on..",21Jan2020,1
14,"We have a Recovery Bank for people with addictions to find help and socialize and go to groups, etc. I was told today that because of my conviction/disorder I can not use the Recovery Bank, even though I have already gone to the one SMART Recovery Meeting and did well. The thing that pisses me the fuck off is a guy there with a gambling addiction and they can ""help"" him...I was told there is nothing they can help me with. That guy's addiction and my addiction are in the same fucking category of Disruptive, Impulse Control, and Conduct Disorders!!!! I understand they want to be ""safe"" but I have not EVER shown that I am a danger and I even voluntarily gave up my lighter and had no problem doing so every time I visited. I would even NOT have it on me if it came down to that because getting help is much more important to me than being comfortable having the lighter on me.  


I am being discriminated against (the one lady submitted a contract to her boss -- kind of like a safety contract for me) but she said I can't come in there now until they ""discuss"" it.  


At this point, even if they say it is OK...I will tell them to fuck themselves (in those words too) because they are lucky I don't hire a lawyer and go after them. I don't have the time, nor the money, nor the confidence that I would win (and honestly, I don't give a shit anymore now anyhow) to even consider going to a lawyer to sue for discrimination, so fuck this. I want to burn down the fucking building, but of course that would be stupid and I can easily stop myself from doing something that drastic. I wouldn't dare do that anyhow. I don't like torching buildings myself (just paper, wood, junk, and Dumpsters...sigh) because I just can't bring myself to do it, even as strong as my urges are--they don't push me to do that, thank God for that. I like to watch the flames during a house fire, but even that is tainted by the sympathy I feel for the people whose lives are fucked because of a fire.   


Then to make my day even MORE fucked, I had police contact today on the way home. I was already pissed off, but I was just sitting outside waiting for the bus (I was sitting on the one side of the building where the bus stop is because the wind was strong and the building blocked it mostly) and I guess I was there for a while because all of a sudden, a cop car made a U-Turn (HAHAH illegally lol) and stopped on the corner. I saw him turn and said ""fuck me..."" because I knew he was gonna stop. I wasn't in trouble because I was just sitting, trying to stay warm. It was extremely cold and windy, so I looked like I was homeless (we are just one tiny step up from homeless right now and struggling to hang on by a thread) so he was just checking on me to make sure I was OK. He had the greatest British accent lol...and he was kinda good-looking...not that I noticed or anything ahahahaha. I still have to report that to my Probation Officer. I left a message (called as soon as I got home), and I actually see her tomorrow, so it's all good. I think I have 24 hours to report police contact and this wasn't anything serious so phew.   


I got $2 from some caring person passing by...sigh. People are really assholes. I wasn't outwardly begging for money (even though it isn't illegal to ask for money as long as you aren't being aggressive or stopping traffic) but damn...I was grateful for that couple dollars, which I gave to my hubby so he can get gas for the car to get to the bank tomorrow.   


Please don't judge me or give me shit about being on the streets...I am doing what I have to until our money comes in (SSI for the 3 boys) at the end of the month. I don't get my money (Disability) until March 3, so it will be fine after that. We are just struggling at the moment.  


And before you say it--yes, we have asked for help and have received food, etc. but with 4 kids at home to feed, what little food we get (I am THANKFUL for everything) has to stretch to breaking. My hubby and I go hungry at night. Thankfully, I get food at the Counseling Center (lunch) and the kids get free breakfast and lunch at school. Hubby also makes due with what we have but often doesn't eat all day. I am not looking for pity, ok? It is what it is, and things are going to get better.  


I guess that is why I am so fucking PISSED at this Recovery Bank discrimination--they were the ones helping us with food!!! I have some calls in, so hopefully we can get what we need elsewhere. I know there are food banks and stuff, but we already got food this month from a lot of them. They absolutely help, and again, I am grateful.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry this is a book. :( I just needed to vent. We are getting minimal food stamps for now, but that is going to stop in March when I get my checks again because we will make just about $100 too much. Then again, we will have all that extra money (from my check) coming in, so it balances itself out nicely.  


Grrrrrrrr. Fucking hell. Thanks for reminding me yet AGAIN that I am a fucking ""dangerous"" person, though I haven't done ANYTHING (at any of the programs I go to) to show that I am a danger. I am a danger just by virtue of being a fucking pyromaniac.  


If I didn't have family--I would SO fucking end my lousy existence once and for all. I have a loving and supportive family so that is enough to keep me here. Plus I REALLY like the Partial Hospitalization Program (at the Counseling Center) too. It is really beneficial and I don't have to pretend to be someone I am not when I am there, unlike when I go out into public.

However the last few days I've noticed myself declining, and today I realized what was happening. I'm feeling more and more depressed every minute and it's like someone is closing my eyes for me. I'm dizzy and feel sick and my mind is telling me to just go to sleep and tell everyone I'm sick. I could try to exercise and keep eating but I don't know if it's worth it.

      I function very well. I pay all my bills on time. I work two part time jobs and I have no problem getting up and going to either job. I hang out with friends often and am very outgoing. The issue is when I get home. 
       When I get home I am completely wiped. Despite the fact I have a list of things I need to get done or want to do for myself, I have no motivation. All I seem to be able to do is sit or lay in my bed and watch TV. 
        I'll tell myself to get up and cook, clean, apply to a grad schools and I can't get myself to move. It gets so bad that I won't use my phone because it's plugged in two feet away and I can't get myself up to grab it.

27,"I have a history of depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, the works. I've been in therapy and on medication for just over 3 years now and I just don't have anything left that I can make myself do. My therapist gives me advice, and sometimes I follow it with bad outcomes, sometimes I can't bring myself to.  
I just went through (almost a year ago, hah) a bad breakup and it's resulted pretty much in me losing all of my trust and all of my happiness. I was doing good before it happened. I was doing really well. I hadn't self-harmed in, geez, like 5 years. Now I'm back at it. I was really happy with who I was, and now I can't stand myself. Nothing changed. Just I had a relationship, and then it was gone. And I haven't been the same since. And it makes me feel like the stupidest person alive. It's not that I think I'll never date again or something; I understand what's happened to me. I understand everything so well. But that doesn't really make a difference.  
I just feel like there's nothing left to do. I can't seem to make friends, and I'm not sure why. I've done the whole 'keep your feelings in and explode' thing. I've done the whole 'talk too much about your problems and everyone thinks you're crazy' thing. I'm a good student; it's not like I can't get out of bed in the morning. I have to. But, it's all I can do. I can't stand the way I feel and no advice my therapist throws at me helps me at all. I just kind of feel like a lost cause. I don't know what to do. I can't kill myself because I'm afraid of dying. I can't drop out of school and burrow away. I can't get myself to take practical steps to get better. I don't have any moves left. No moves but trudge along my miserable way through school, using really bad coping mechanisms to make myself feel a fraction of a bit better. I just don't see things ever improving. Not in a way that matters.  
I kind of just want to quit therapy and pretend like there's nothing wrong with me like I did before, but I suppose I was miserable then too. I just wish I wasn't miserable. I wish I had the motivation to do anything important. Anything at all.  
I don't even know why I'm making this post but I guess I'm just going on a limb. I'm just trying to grasp for anything I can find, 'cause I just don't know what to do anymore.

She has half finished balconies. Knocked down and then put up the same walls a bunch of times. Changed the door placement for the entrance to a room multiple times. Always finding crazy wierdos to do work on the cheap that needs to be redone. Never had flooring. 

This isn’t even the  beginning of it. And it isn’t just me. So many people have shown concern. Builders who offer her advice she tends to not hire because she hates hearing the truth. 

Now that Nanna is gone it’s just me and her. And she doesn’t really have any friends that are mentally sound either. I thought I’d try and make a post cause it’s something that deeply stresses me out as it’s worse than ever and I don’t want her to go broke. She wants to cut a giant hole on the lounge room so that she can have it ready for a stair case into another level underneath. (Her house is on a hill on stilts so a basement floor could be possible after a lot of excavating. 

I have no one to offer her advice other than me. She scoffs and gets super defensive when I try to help her. But she has been listening more lately so I think maybe if I can get a professional mental health person in to maybe give an intervention it may help. I dunno.

Last night she tried to kill herself by overdosing on some meds, thankfully her parents got to her in time and she is at the hospital. The thing is, I want to talk to her but I dont know what to say, I wanna give her some space first so she can clear her mind, but I dont know how much time I should wait, also, a couple of years ago I attempted suicide, obviously I failed, but Ive never told her, after this I want to tell her so she knows I kinda understand what she is going through, but I dont know if its appropiate, like I dont want her to think that Im trying to make it about me",21Jan2020,1

I’m about *this* close to losing my shit.

35,"Alrighty. For my first post imma talk about this weird feeling I have literally 24/7. First of all, I fucking hate it. Anyways, so all the time I have this feeling that I’m being watched??? This feeling has been persistent for about 6years now I think. I don’t really remember when it started.  And it’s not that anxious feeling you get like in public where a stranger might be watching you or something creepy, it’s like, people I know, the people change over time as they come and go irl but it feels like people I look up to or want to impress or just don’t want to disappoint are watching me. Like, when I’m laying down, when I shower, use the restroom, walk, in class at school or just doing anything. It kinda feels like I’m always putting on a performance because of this, always perfect posture when I walk, never slouching or laying down on the couch in an unflattering way, never eating food messily or impolitely even when I’m alone. Because the people are watching me. I know no ones actually watching me cause the technology my mind makes up to make such things happen don’t actually exist that I know of. I thought that maybe this is what being paranoid is so I googled it (I know I know, not the best method of research) but all the symptoms aren’t it. It says symptoms of PPD are things like being quick to anger, defensive, and thinking that people are going to hurt you. I’ve never felt that someone would hurt me, not even strangers on the street! And I’ve never just been quick to anger with people unless they straight up do some wack shit like continue talking to me when I’ve said to stop, standing too close or touching when I’ve repeatedly said to stop or just straight up being a dick/homophobic/sexist.

It was a really important relationship to me, and while we dealt with a lot, 95% of the relationship was actually amazing. But I was going through my fb post history and finding old interactions between the two of us, and it’s like I barely recognize her. It feels like it’s another life that isn’t mine.

41,"Sorry if this is rambly, I tried to just get to the point as quick as I could without listing off a ton of specific incidents, more an overview of how I feel.

I have mild tourrete syndrome and in honestly kind of an Aspergers case as well. For most of my childhood everything was ok. Adults didn't really understand my condition fully and it showed at times, there was another kid in my year who I'm pretty sure now was full blown autistic, in the earlier days before he was really struggling to keep up with the class, the teacher wanted me to coach him on coping with his disability, kind of messed up, but whatever.

Until I got to grade 6, before then my teachers showed me respect, I was a straight A student with no record of misbehaving, no reason to give me a hard time. My 6th grade teacher took one look at me and saw a special needs student. At the beginning of the year everybody got to choose their seats, and then a week in he would make tweaks, I got put in the corner of the room with the teacher's aide and two legit special needs kids. 

My school had a traditional program where seniors (6th/7th grade) get to read to the Kindergartners and Grade 1s, everybody would be assigned their own ""little buddy"" and we would get to read to them for like half an hour once a week. I was the only one in class who got excluded because there weren't enough Little Buddies to go around, even though one girl in my class had two little buddies for some reason. He just wrecked my self esteem over and over with mean stunts like that, I got him for Grade 7 as well. 

I went into his classes with Straight As and left with Cs, he threw me into a downward spiral that took a solid decade before I started to show signs of recovery. On the last day of Grade 7 and heading off to High School he told me I was going to be assigned a special needs aide next year to follow me around in each class. That was never true, it was purely out of cruelty that he said that to me.

No teacher in high school was ever as awful to me, but the damage was done. I had no motivation to do anything in school and my grades got worse and worse. I would just sleep in classes, never do my homework, and just barely scrape by with good test scores and make-up assignments during Summer. Every year would be progressively worse, and teachers for some reason just failed to see how ill I was. By grade 11 I was an alcoholic and regularly drinking during classes. In Grade 12 I finally broke halfway through and just dropped out. None of my former friends or classmates knows to this day what actually happened to me. 

I bounced back a bit the following year and graduated through an alternative education program. And then just kind of floundered around for 3 years mostly unemployed and just playing World of Warcraft while being severely depressed. I finally got a full time job at Tim Hortons when I was 22, I went back to school on the side and upgraded all my high school academics. I eventually became manager of the store, and then got headhunted by the CRA to work for the government instead. I know I should be happy with what I've made of myself, but I'm just not.

I'm still damaged, and I am hateful of so much around me in this world. I hate how much hate I have in me all the time. I'm constantly reflecting on my life and who I am and why I am the way I am. There are two people I always remember. The first is my 6th grade teacher, the defining moment in my life where it all went wrong. And my rage just intensifies when I think of it. I can't wrap my head around how awful he is, I wasn't his only victim, how could somebody be that cruel? I can't just move on because I don't accept it, I can't accept that he got away with it.

I often feel like I will never move on until I inevitably publicly confront him and call him out. He does not deserve to have his name unsullied. Wrappin this up, the 2nd person I think of when reflecting on my past was my high school Spanish teacher. She was a really kind person, in my last class with her she gave us all personalized farewell cards. I don't remember most of what she wrote to me, but it opened with ""(Name), I don't understand you..."". Ironic, that she of all my teachers was the closest to ever understanding me.",21Jan2020,1

this may be a bit long because i have a lot to say. i dont really care if anyone even reads this or not i just need to get it off my chest. it might also be confusing because im just writing stuff as i think of it and i doubt ill actually proofread it

my friend's name is cal. it didnt use to be that. i think he started as gabe but his name changed multiple times a day. it was always still him though. we are both just really indecisive. cal seems to have stuck for a few weeks now though so i guess thats what we're going with

most of the time we just chat in my head since i have family members living with me and i dont want to seem insane to them. i do prefer talking to him outloud though so i will as often as i can. i think he likes it better that way too. 

hes almost always there either freaking out about whatever show or movie we are watching or cracking jokes with me. ive talked about him quite a bit to my other friends but i always make sure to leave out the part that hes not really ""real"". 

now that i think about it i dont even really know if ""imaginary friend"" is the right thing to call him. and imaginary friend would be perfect and i would decide who they are and what they think. i dont have that control over cal though and if i did id be much happier to just let him be his own person anyways. 

he doesnt really know much about anything since he only knows what i know education wise. he hasnt been around long either and ive had so much fun introducing him to all the things i love. he doesnt always feel the same way about them but thats to be expected from time to time.

he actually just saw snow for the first time a few nights ago

we dont have the same opinions on everything. especially not the little stuff. like his favorite color is yellow and mine is purple and/or blue. he doesnt always like the stuff i watch or read and i dont always enjoy what he enjoys. 

hes exactly like any ""normal"" friend except hes always there and not real.

i dont know why he is here even. i dont think im lonely. i see my other friends pretty often. almost every weekend and some weekdays. all i know is that since he showed up ive stopped having panic attacks. and he helps me treat myself better. encourages me to clean my room or shower. even just reminding me to take my pills so i can sleep at night. 

i dont think id be where i am now if it werent for him. for the first time since i can remember i can genuinely say that i want to stay alive and that is so amazing to me that i cant just keep it all in

if you for some reason ended up reading all this then cal and i both want to thank you so much.

we hope you all have an amazing week

She was poly and explained it to me. I was hesitant and even scared, but I let her introduce me to this new and exciting world. We grew very, very close. We teased each other about getting married one day. Eventually I asked her if the teasing was just teasing or if she really did want to get married. She said she wanted to, and I smiled the biggest smile ever. I got to talk to her kids and we were making plans to meet. 
After two years, something happened. She asked if she could introduce someone new to our relationship. Again, I was hesitant but I said yes. I asked if there could be rules in place, such as no webcam sex until I had gotten used to it. She began to claim I wasn’t understanding polyamory and that I was being manipulative. She said she needed a break but we could still rp.

While I still consider myself a Christian, I am way more open minded and welcoming to others and feel like my view of God is night and day different than when I was younger. 

Over the last year or so I’ve been going to counseling and got back on medication for anxiety, and over the last half a year I’ve been writing articles on my Medium account talking about a lot of these life/mindset changes I’ve been going through.  Last week, I reached a point where I actually opened up fully and publicly about my anxiety and what I’ve been doing to work through it.  A year ago I couldn’t have imagined doing that.

If you feel like you’re in a place where anxiety has you locked up, it doesn’t have to stay that way forever.  You can get out of it.  If you need someone to give you permission to get help for yourself, let’s talk.

I feel, fake in a way, like I’m just being an attention seeker. Like I want to have a mental illness but I don’t. I will think “hey wouldn’t it be great if I had a panic attack right now?” And shit like that. I can’t talk about this to my friends because I am the one with no problems, a good family, happy life etc... I listen to their problems all the time and get involved in their drama. I feel like a walking talking therapist who can make funny jokes about having depression and talk a bit about how I am sad sometimes, then it goes back to them and all. I feel like trash because I know they need it and I am honestly good. They are the ones who have tried to commit suicide and have parents that don’t love them. The ones who rave run away from home and had exes cheat on them. I just feel like an attention whore for even thinking about bothering them with my minor problems. Going back, I remember the first time I cut, I was so proud to show my friend who introduced it to me because I was like her! Even now when my friends cut they show me and our friend group and their other friends. It gets the worst at night, I feel like there are a million voices inside me all saying different things, one voice will say to not go to school tomorrow and take a mental health break like my other friend did! Another voice says that is stupid, you aren’t even depressed, just go to bed, don’t make your friends worry about you, they already have enough on their plates. I have tried to talk to my mom about it before and it was okay for a little bit when talking about how I was kind of tired of my friends drama.

You don’t ever seem depressed, you are a very happy kid” and I just agreed and she brushed it off. Even typing this out is making me have second thoughts.

67,"I was put on Psych meds at 19 (I'm now 31) after a panic attack.

The meds were prescribed by the family GP and he didn't monitor me on them.  Fast forward 5 years and they stopped working so he prescribed me another one.

I suffer from Chronic Fatigue after a bout of Glandular Fever that I never fully recovered from. I thought the meds might be contributing to the fatigue so I weaned off early 2018.

The withdrawals were very tough so I went to a Psychiatrist and he prescribed me another med + an antipsychotic at a low dose to help with my trouble sleeping. I had a terrible reaction and developed Akathisia. It sent me into a month long spiral of terror and involuntary movements.

I stopped taking the meds and refuse to take anymore because Akathisia was the most indescribable terror I have ever experienced, worse than any panic attack or depressive episode.

Ever since then I have what I can only describe as brain damage. I can't handle any mental stress. By stress I mean anytime I have to concentrate, like right now my feet are twitching, ears are ringing and I am heavily agitated because I have to focus while writing this. 

I have no respite, I can't exercise because of Chronic Fatigue, I can't take medication to ease the mental side effects, and I am deathly scared of seeing a mental health professional. The power they have frightens me and I don't trust them enough not to send me to the psych ward. I'm too scared that if I say something that alarms them (I'm not suicidal) they will have me admitted. If I get admitted I will be given medication. There's a chance that the medication will cause Akathisia and I will die. That isn't a dramatisation. I will die.

I don't know what to do because all the traditional advice like exercise, diet, medication and meditation has no effect on me.

75,"I’ve been struggling with a lot of body image issues for about 10 months now. It’s been about 9 months since I began to obsess over my calorie intake, exercise, and purging. I began dating my girlfriend around the time this started, though she has absolutely nothing to do with it. I ended up breaking up with her and cutting ties with the majority of my friends when school came back around this year because I snapped. My anxiety and depression had suddenly worsened and my eating habits became worse. I lost a significant amount of weight in the span of about a month, causing my family to notice. I lost my period, I would barely eat, and I went down quite a few clothing sizes. My self hatred, shame, and embarrassment caused me to attempt to take my own life multiple times. I was admitted into a treatment program for anxiety and depression, where I did not even mention a word about my possible eating disorder issues. Looking back, I realize how stupid that was of me. But a large part of me did not want to “recover”, and I often still feel the same way. Even though this thing consumes my life completely and is on my mind 24/7, I still can’t bring myself to genuinely believe that there is anything wrong. I recently got back together with my girlfriend, and I told her about my struggles primarily over the summer. I told her I am ok now, though not much has changed. I am lying to her about something that drove me to break up with her in the first place, and something that she deserves to know about. I cant stop myself from purging. I just purged tonight. I just can’t and sometimes I want it all to stop so badly. Food is always on my mind and no matter what I do I can’t change it. Recovery is very intimidating and I don’t feel I qualify for it or deserve it. But I love my girlfriend so much and I don’t want to lose her. I am losing myself again and I’m always tired. My hair is falling out. I see my weight going down on the scale but I don’t see a visual change in my body and that’s all my brain wants to see. But my heart wants to better myself for the people around me because they don’t deserve to deal with this bullshit that I’m dragging them through. The only people that know anything about this are my girlfriend and (very vaguely) my therapist. I don’t know what to do. I cant help myself and I feel no one can help me.",21Jan2020,1

77,"Hi, so basically I just need to rant about this because I feel like I'm completely losing my mind and I have no idea what is wrong with me and nobody seems to understand what I mean, I barely understand what I mean. Basically, I'm 17, I've been on Prozac (40 mg) for about 6 months? I think? I don't even remember when I started. I go to therapy bi-weekly. I feel completely empty and lost. My mental health seems like something that nobody can crack, not even me. I feel invalid and stupid whenever I complain about my mental wellbeing, and I don't know if it's because of metacognition or whatever, I just feel like that I'm self-aware of what's wrong with me it makes me fake. My trauma feels fake, my whole life feels fake and most times I can't remember being so viscerally angry or upset, I kept a trauma journal since my 17th birthday to make sure I remember when I have breakdowns and stuff, for a while I felt like someone was erasing my memory while I was asleep or that my medication erases my memory, and I still believe that now. I just don't feel like I fit into the mental illness box, my boyfriend says I'm not mentally ill and that bad stuff just happened to me, so that makes me feel fake and stupid, but I know he has the best intentions. My therapist just passes it off as anxiety and depression, which I know are serious things but it doesn't feel like anyone in my life takes me seriously. I can't open up about certain things without feeling they're downplayed, or that my traumas weren't severe enough, or that I'm making stuff up. 

Basically, I grew up in a super shitty home, (my therapist confirmed this), the school I go to and my therapist have almost called CPS numerous times. When I was very young (around 3-4) I was diagnosed with PAN and spent 6 months in intensive care. I had most of my intestines removed. I don't remember much about the hospital but my parents say that I was very angry, and I would bite and scream all the time. I don't remember anything about it really. From ages 8-12 I believed I was an angel and that my parents couldn't be my ""real"" parents because my ""real"" parents would never hurt me. I truly believed that the day I turned 12 I would be brought to live in the clouds with my true angel mother who would never hurt me, and that I was on earth to suffer for a little while before I was able to be happy. Of course, that never happened and my delusion completely fell apart as soon as I woke up in the same bed.  When I was 13 I had vivid hallucinations of a ""Ring"" style girl with long black hair ripping out her intestines at the end of my bed. I had flashing images of fucked up faces that were in front of my eyes. I know I wasn't dreaming. I also hallucinated a boy who opened his mouth full of teeth and he ate me. I didn't sleep that night and cried on the floor. I had hallucinations outside the next day of a giant furry creature with huge teeth. There were other things. Those hallucinations only lasted 3 days before I think things went back to normal and I no longer had visual hallucinations or auditory ones. At least none that I can remember. I also have extreme apathy about my family, I feel no love towards them whatsoever. When I was 12 I prayed every day that my parents would die in a car crash. I always fantasized about a ""Sucker Punch"" style revenge where I would kill them all and get to be free. I hoped a lot that my family would die and I could escape. I've never acted on those thoughts of course, but they've been extremely present and intrusive throughout my whole life. My freshmen year of high school I was sexually assaulted, the school did nothing, they knew about it, the kid wasn't even punished. It wasn't that bad, just unwanted groping so I didn't even have it bad. I have vivid nightmares about being raped almost every week, often 2 or 3 nights in a row. They're extremely lucid, not that I can do anything but that I can feel everything happening. They're often violent and I am scared to go to sleep sometimes. I believed I was being raped while I slept by my father or a demon but I can acknowledge that that's a ridiculous thing to believe. I've had a few suicide attempts but I've never been hospitalized. 

That's about all I can remember. That's all my mental stuff thrown out there. I don't know. Most times I feel extremely fake. I feel like I am empty and blank all the time. I feel like I don't know who I am, that I can't even rely on myself to judge my self-concept. Sometimes I feel like just anxiety and depression doesn't explain it all, and that nobody is taking me seriously. I don't know what to tell my therapist, because whenever I go into his office I am suddenly fine and in a good mood. I write stuff down in my trauma journal or in my phone but I can't work up the courage to talk about it. I don't know what to do. I feel like I am about to snap. The best way I can put it is that my foundation is infested in termites, and there are so many holes and pieces rotting and being eaten away, but everyone has just put a gloss over it and pretends like that's enough even though the termites still chew away at it. I feel like I'm on a stack of cards built on top of that gloss, and at any second the foundation will fall away. I feel like a blanket is being pulled over my head and I'm suffocating. I just don't know what to do. I should be grateful that I'm on medication and have therapy but I just don't feel like my needs are being met. I know that's selfish to say but some things don't add up. Recently I've missed a lot of days for my meds, but on those days at least I feel like myself again, I feel like a person instead of a husk. I just don't know what's wrong with me, if I'm being ungrateful and unreasonable or if something really is wrong. Anyways that's my rant.",21Jan2020,1

79,"I’m sorry if this wasn’t an appropriate sub to do this...

throwaway because my actual u/ is recognizable. I also apologize in advance that I’m going to explain a lot and it’s going to be really long, but this will be the first time I’ve ever told the entire story to someone, and I just need to do it. 

In April 2018, I [20F at the time] was at a university event with a ton of people that I knew and that knew me very well. I had just broken up with my boyfriend of almost a year, but we were still figuring out what breaking up looked like, because I was his first girlfriend, and it was generally a weird time. Anyway, so at this event, there was a guy who was 4(ish) years older than me who I didn’t know. He took an interest in me and it was sweet at first, as I had not really been hit on for over a year since being in the relationship. It very quickly became very uncomfortable. In pretty much every photo from that event, it looks normal, but I know that his hand was up my dress behind the scenes. He tried to kiss me against a wall at one point during the night but I pushed him off and ignored his advances for the rest of the first half of the night. 

Later on that night, my roommate who was also at the event and I invited a group of our friends back to our house to drink and wind down the night closer to home. I didn’t know until we were already at my house that someone that my roommate had invited had driven the guy to and from the event, and so he showed up at my house. He was one of my roommates friends, which I also didn’t know until this point. I didn’t want to be rude and cause a scene, so I didn’t say anything. I made a point to sit in our armchair, so he couldn’t sit next to me, and also positioned the chair on the complete opposite side of the room, with the large, circular coffee table between us (this is important). Cut a long story slightly shorter, I ended up getting way more drunk than I intended to, more than I originally thought I was at the time. 

By this point in the night, our other friends had mostly begin to filter out and go home. After saying goodbye to them, there was my roommate, me, the guy and his ride from earlier left in the house. My roommate went to the bathroom and I’m not sure where the ride went. I went to get up to put my glass in the sink in the kitchen, and in order to do so I had to walk around the coffee table. I don’t really know why I didn’t walk around all the couches, if I had maybe none of this would’ve happened. I hate myself for that. When I did this, I had my glass in one hand and my phone in the other. As I walked around, he told me to come sit with him, and I said “no, I’m going to the kitchen” he said something else, then reached up and grabbed my hand that was holding my phone and pulled me down into his lap. I remember trying to get up and not being able to, dropping the glass onto the couch, and him putting my phone out of reach.

Apparently by this point, my roommate and the ride saw this, me on top of his lap, and decided that it was consensual, since I’d just broken up with my boyfriend and they’d seen him flirting with me beforehand. She also claims that she had asked me how I felt about him earlier in the night and I laughed but didn’t say anything, but I don’t remember this. Ultimately, my roommate and the ride decided not to intervene and the ride drove home and left the guy with me, and my roommate went to bed. 

The last thing I remember that night is being guided or carried into my room and the door slamming behind me. I remember also feeling overpowered and scared, because he was extremely tall, especially by my standards (I’m above 5’10 for reference without specificity). When I “came to” I was shaking uncontrollably in bed around 7/8am the next morning. I rolled over and someone was in bed next to me. I thought perhaps my roommate had left the door unlocked and my ex-boyfriend had come over to try and talk, found that I was too drunk and decided to stay. I checked my phone first for evidence of that, and of course there was nothing. Then I finally saw his face and realized what was going on. Panic set in, and there’s a lot of blanks after this too. I remember that he woke up like nothing was wrong and asked if I’d give him a ride home. I didn’t really know how to respond to that because I’ve never been good with confrontation. I took him home. As soon as he got out of my car, I broke down. I had the worst panic attack I’d ever had in the parking lot adjacent to his house. I was probably there for more than an hour, because I remember I didn’t get home until after noon. 

I tried to talk to my roommate about what happened, and we ended up falling out as friends because she didn’t believe I would dare to accuse one of her friends of rape because she’d seen me sitting on his lap, which she took was being consensual. I don’t necessarily agree with that, but I honestly wasn’t in the right state of mind to argue with her over something I couldn’t remember or even begin to explain. She accused me of calling it rape to cover up me cheating on my boyfriend, but I hadn’t told her that we’d broken up already and wouldn’t believe me after I told her. So we cut our losses, moved out and moved on.

Honestly? I [now 23 at the time of this post] don’t know if this is actually rape. I’ll let you all answer that for me, I guess. But since then, I’m damaged. I was a victim of domestic abuse/violence two years before this happened, and the year in between I was drugged at a party and would’ve put money on me dying (but thankfully was well taken care of by kind strangers who have since become friends). The culmination of all of these things affects me every day. I’ve never had therapy, because my family does not believe in it, and even if they did approve, I couldn’t afford it. I can’t maintain or even desire being in a relationship, having sex is terrifying but I do it to make the other person happy and hope that one day I’ll just have sex and I won’t be scared anymore. I have flashbacks and random panic attacks  while out with friends, and now it’s affecting me at work due to what I do (ironically, therapy.) 

Any kind of advice or help you can offer me or even just talking to me would help at this point. I’m consistently sitting on the edge just waiting for the next traumatic thing to happen. I can’t live like this anymore.",21Jan2020,1
80,"Both of us are very depressed, very sad people. We try our hardest to get into the university at the moment, but everything feels pointless. We both are trying to get good grades from school, however, they are suffering big time. Nevertheless, I try, but getting good or at least better grades than my friend has become a torture. I feel like we are alone in this world, but together, a team, and getting a better grade is a betrayal. My friend is not happy for me (for getting good grades), nor he is proud. He calls himself stupid, talks in an agressive way, at times threathens suicide, tells me that I am better than him in every way, that he is a failure and so on. I understand him, I know how he feels, and I do not know how to make him feel better.

Yesterday, I was wishing to get a bad grade, only to make him feel better and avoid all of the drama that comes with a good one,  but I got one score higher than him, and he is unwilling to go to school today.

At times I fail my tests on purpose, getting a good grade to me now induces stress, makes me feel very bad and scares me. I do not feel any satisfaction, or anything besides bad feeligs.

82,"I love my job. It's maybe the only thing that gives me a consistent feeling of self-worth, and I'm surrounded by fun and supportive coworkers. It has been keeping me going and I'm extremely grateful. So I don't want to risk losing it or the support of my coworkers, even if the law might protect me to enter a rehab program.

If I felt I really needed to, to turn my life around, I wondered what my options for short-term (2-6 weeks) suicidal ideation rehabilitation in New York City, and what I might expect from the program. It sounds ignorant and I admit I am—I admit I'm driven by a momentary spark of feeling self-care.

That's all, but here is more if someone would be willing to read, especially to dispel concern that I'm beyond ideation.

It's been 15 years since I remember wanting to take my life. I'm 30-something now. I made it this far because of good times with girlfriends and chasing dreams, because of novelties like doing drugs with friends or moving to a new city, and also because of therapy at times and medicine at times. Life always had something new to distract me. But there was never a stretch longer than week I think, that I didn't think about dying.

I always looked for some feeling that felt different one day in my life, anything to latch onto. And right now I feel something like that. I want to try again to find a therapist, despite the exhausting and disappointing process. I want to commit to seeing a psychiatrist regularly and open my mind to any medicine they want to suggest—in a way, I'm ready to submit to them. I want to drink less. All this, not because I care about me, but because I'm sick and tired of making my family and friends and coworkers feel the way I make them feel. Never seeming well, always worried or stressed or tired, everyone having to tiptoe, and closer ones walking on glass. Never being able to commit because I won't know how I'll feel, even the next day. Not replying to texts for days or weeks, and completely having given up on phone calls and emails. Never wanting anything even when they want do so much for me, because ultimately I don't give a damn about myself. Annually cutting communication with everyone and hearing later that they each wondered what they did wrong, when in fact it was my inability to cope with the burden and harm I felt I was to them.

If I *want* to die but still don't have the *will* to die, then *until* I gain the will to die, I want to get better, for all these people I've hurt and I'm going to hurt, wallowing and existing doing no service to anyone. I don't have the capacity to care about myself, but I have some capacity to care for others.

And I thought, aside from *trying* everything I say I want to do, then possibly failing and falling back to square one, what can I do to really drive it in, really feel like this time it's a real attempt to be better? And I thought, maybe I can prove it to myself by committing to a rehab program, even if it means unpaid leave from my job, and taking it from there.

Maybe none of this is a good idea, I don't know now.",21Jan2020,1

For some background: I am 21 and female. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, severe anxiety, and BPD. I struggle with suicidal ideation.

Recently I’ve plummeted as far as mental health goes. I hurt myself yesterday. I have a plan as to how I’d kill myself. My house is filthy and I’ve no desire to clean, let alone get out of bed in the morning. I sleep too much or not at all, ya know, the usual stuff.

My SO thinks inpatient would be good for me. He’s worried about me. He told me he’s scared to leave me alone and feels like he has to ‘babysit’ me or I’ll hurt myself or commit suicide. 

I am honestly terrified to try it out. I’m so scared of getting better because I’m at least familiar with being low. Being happy is intimidating because it’s unfamiliar.

85,"tia,

you are almost 13. you never thought you'd get this far, and you almost didn't. i know things are hard right now, it has been exactly one month since you saw your mum. i hate to say it, but it will be a very, very long time until you see her again.

life has been absolute shit. you have anorexia nervosa now, and an addiction to meth. you hear voices sometimes too, and 50% of the time you don't even feel like yourself, you feel like a completely different person. the summer after your suicide attempt (good news, it failed) you had a flashback of your mum when you looked in your bathroom mirror so you cut off all your hair and tried to change your name to something with no familial attatchment. then, to make things worse, you got adopted. it was terrible, and you were high the whole day.

you can no longer be used as a sacrafice anymore though, you lost your virginity. that's kind of cool, even though you lost it because the person promised you drugs in return. how could you ever turn that down? during your overdose you somehow managed to smoke your first cigarette out of your bedroom window, it was the closest to heaven you had ever felt. you will smoke many more in the years to come. you opened up quite a bit, not emotionally though. you opened up physically.

your body was less of a temple and more of a motel. a tiny, afraid, underweight motel. you remember almost nothing from when you were 13. your cat also died, and it sucked because you started to like her more than most people. your other cat is still alive, but she's not much like herself. she's old and has dementia. she'll still give you kisses and purr when you hold her though. your grades decline A LOT by the way, it causes a lot of issues for you.

your room triggers you, you hate things touching your body, you cry more often than you let on, you barely leave the house, and you hate yourself more than anything. your life got fucked up because you decided it was a good idea to try meth. it ended with 8 months in a lockdown rehabilitation facility where you were emotionally drained the entire time. you did break the law (twice) and punch a man in the ear while you were there though, that's always a fun story to tell.

yeah, life is still kinda shit. and i hate to break it to you but this will not be your last suicide attempt, you'll try at least 4 more times before you finally give up in a good way.

last year you finally came out as lesbian. you've brought your grades up quite a bit too, and your aunt and uncle are really proud. you don't really care because you feel like it isn't good enough, but either way improvement is always good. you have almost 2 years clean off of meth, which is fucking epic, bro. yeah, rehab gave you some ptsd but at least it helped you clean up your act a bit. you're much less of a pussy now, you sneak out all the time and you always get away with it. you smoke weed with people you never thought you'd get high with, the people who don't want you getting high. it's nice.

my dude, you also get yourself a girlfriend. she is the most beautiful thing on the planet, i can't wait for you to see her in real life, it changes everything. she has bullied you into loving her by always being pretty and smart and caring and sweet. it is bullshit, don't let anyone else do that to you. anyways, she and i/you will be together for 2 years in early march. hell yeah.

in other cool news, there's this really fuckin cool kid who lives down the street. y'all meet at therapy, and now you're best friends. she is by far, the best friend you've ever had, and one of your most favourite people on earth. which is underrstandable, because she's hella pretty and nice and funny and epic. be friends with her for a long time, i will be so mad if i fuck this one up.

like, fuck yeah things suck but bro you have never been so ok either. i wish things were better, but i've learned to settle with ok. it getss better dude, when you wake up you'll be absolutely miserable and sick and tired and afraid, it is by far one of the worst things you'll ever feel. but it doesn't last. nothing does, so just chill out because this is just the tip of the iceberg. it only goes downhill from here.

and then it goes uphill. then things are finally worth it, i promise.

87,"I’ve never told anyone else this. As it’s super weird and I’m ashamed of it. My darkest secret. When I was 8 or 9 I was sexually assaulted by my older brother. He was 12 or 13 at the time. And on multiple occasions. Those memories were stored away soon after they happened. Though when I turned 12 or 13 I grew a serious porn addiction. The weirdest thing about it is I mostly only watched a very specific position I were assaulted in years prior (even sub consciously to this day) . And I didn’t even remember it happening to me. Because of this I’m now 19 with little to no social skills in college. I’m extremely anxious all the time. I lack standard emotions and I probably have mild psychosis. I put up a good facade though. I was a Highschool football star, came from a poor family but I made good grades and I got a scholarship to college. Always seem happy. But no one knows what goes on in my head. As I’m typing this I’m feeling pure relief because this is the first I’ve ever mentioned it anywhere. My family’s now broken up. My sister has a baby and lives in the projects, my mother moved out of my step dad’s house (I don’t know my real father) and my older brother is selling drugs. My great grandma who raised us doesn’t even remember me anymore. I miss the feeling of a family. I feel like I should go see someone . Talk to someone. But I don’t know who. I’ve been having random thoughts of suicide but never the urge to carry it out. I’m scared that I will someday. So what do i do. Please I need answers.",21Jan2020,1
88,"I don't know what I want to accomplish by posting here, I've just been feeling like garbage and need to get it out to people who don't know me or expect anything of me, lol. This won't be interesting to read.

I live in Australia, known for being on fire. I'm 25 and was first diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 14. If you had told me then that I would still be suicidal more than 10 years from then, I don't know if I would have been willing to keep on going. And the thought of another 10 years like this makes me feel so depressed I don't know what to do. I can count the periods of my life since then where I *wasn't* wicked depressed on one hand. And it's stupid, because it's not like I've had any particular struggles. I was diagnosed with ASD at 20 (late, I know), graduated school and moved to a nice city for a reasonably well-paying, entry level, year-long contract in my field at 22. While I was living apart from them my parents split up, but I was already an adult, so.

At 24 I moved back to my hometown for a job that I'd been verbally assured of for the next year - there would be a month of training with several other applicants, and out of them three of us would be hired (so, I thought, me and two others). Two weeks into the training the manager took me aside and told me the guarantee was being rescinded as my performance wasn't what they were expecting (in their words, my demo reel \[I'm an animator\] ""was misleading"". obviously it was all my work lol). I had moved cities at pretty significant expense (animators aren't known for their high salaries), from somewhere with much more opportunity, and felt pretty winded by this - obviously if I had been told ""come here for a month and maybe you'll get hired"", I would have made pretty different plans. Instead of staying for another two weeks to pretty likely get rejected again, I left for a three-month freelance thing, and have been jumping from gig to gig ever since - longer-term positions in animation in my hometown are pretty hard to come by. At the moment I'm working from home, and money is really really tight as hours are pretty hard to nail down when you're working freelance.

After what happened with that studio, I was feeling pretty destabilised and negative about my future in this industry, so I've started studying another discipline part time, online. But I'm finding it very difficult to balance freelancing from home (right now on two separate projects), keeping my life moving w/ cooking, cleaning and all, and study, and my grades aren't good at all, although I know I have ability - I get excellent grades on work I turn in, but other assessments I fail just by nonsubmission because I can't make myself complete them.

My motivation is completely shot. I'm exhausted all the time and cry for no reason every day. I've done everything everyone tells me to - I eat really healthily, almost all food I cook myself, I work out, I have a cat, I make time to see my family and friends, I take my medication every day, I drink plenty of water. (I have PCOS and hypothyroidism, but my doctor won't consider putting me on thyroid medication, so I just try to mitigate what I can with good diet and exercise). I went to a psychiatrist and he just told me to get off my antidepressants and lectured me about big pharma. I've seen lots of psychologists over the last 10 years and faithfully do my mindfulness exercises and interrogate my thoughts for their usefulness and fairness. But I still have anxiety attacks several times a week. I just don't know what to do. I feel overwhelmed by living in the world and by my own uselessness. I feel completely worthless and unequal to my life, even my relatively easy, safe life. I'm always scrambling just to stay afloat. The world just seems black, I can't see any future. Sorry if you read all this.",21Jan2020,1
89,"I keep getting ignored. It infuriates me because it KEEPS HAPPENING. Everyone from old friends, family, and even new people I message. It really makes me feel like raging. If this keeps up, I won't be able to contain my depression and anger anymore. The people that will talk to me don't offer much in terms of a conversation, even with my excessive efforts to carry the conversation. They're simply incapable of transcribing their thoughts to text.
   I'm a lonely person. My health is deteriorating. I do just enough to maintain my body so I'm not miserable. I just want to feel like I have a chance to find love or even an unwavering faithful companion. These days, life is becoming a major chore with no compensation. I get no benefits for taking care of myself. Where is the hope I need to continue fighting the loneliness?
   I long for connection to another human being. At the same time, I'm growing colder to everyone and I want to turn violent. Let's see how much I get ignored then. But I don't want to my life to end or the quality of it suffer because people don't want to acknowledge my messages or give me a moment of their time. I have so much to offer. BUT I DON'T EVEN GET THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE TO CHANGE SOMEONE'S MIND. It has almost entirely shifted my self image.
   I used to be happier until I realized that I'm an unapproachable, unappealing, insignificant piece of trash. I cheated on my last serious girlfriend when we were in high school and I gave up on dating or being with someone(by choice) because I burned with remorse. I became content with working on myself, making sure I didn't hurt someone like that again.
   Some years passed, and I decided that I had punished myself and grew enough, that it was time to start looking for a potential mate. Since then, I haven't had anything close to a girlfriend. It's been almost ten years since we broke up and about 7 years since I got back on the horse. This is starting to look like concrete evidence that I'm not worthy of anyone's time. I will probably get pity comments saying contrary, but nothing will change. People will continue to perceive me as something to avoid at all costs.
   What can I do? Is this what it's like trying to date during your twenties? Am I just that ugly? Are skinny people hated? I literally have no clue how to feel better about being so low on the totem pole. 
   That's just my love life, my ex best friend of 10 plus years was the most toxic, manipulative person I've ever met. He ruined my reputation just because we were friends. I couldn't ever perceive the situation from the outside looking in until we had our final falling out. By that time it was too late. Now everyone associates me with him and they probably think I'm a heartless heathen 😭😭 plus who knows what he's been saying about me 😭😭😭 
   This happened somewhat recently and lead me to a deep depression which lead to a severe decrease of my health. It got to the point where I couldn't even walk to my kitchen and fix something to eat without my body trying to shut down from malnutrition. I started eating about a week ago. I don't feel or look as healthy as I did before, but I can actually get up and move around a lot more than before. I have an appetite, a potential job interview coming up, and people that do care about me, but my body craves something more than they can give me.
   I want a best friend. I want to be desired as a mate. I just want to feel like I have a purpose. And with so much strife happening in my life, that throws out any, if not all, possibility of a mate considering me as a candidate until I get my life straightened out. Which, when my life was optimal, the chances were already slim to none. The people that were drawn to me had ulterior motives. They didn't want me for me. 
   Anyways, venting my frustrations have helped me calm down, but I have no direction of what to do next. If you want to help, feel free to ask questions or give advice. That's probably gonna be the most interaction I get from another person if this post doesn't get ignored too. Thanks for reading and I hope nobody has to feel like I do :/",21Jan2020,1
90,"I am 18M and when I was 11-12 I was molested by a boy 3-4 years older than me. I don’t remember the exact age I was for some reason. Same with my dad. He used to hit me, but I can’t remember when it started it when it ended. I remember him becoming my friend and gaining my trust, then one time we were in the lake and we were play fighting and he wrapped his legs around mine and closed them shut so I couldn’t escape and he started touching and grabbing me through my thin soccer shorts that I was wearing as swim shorts at the time. For years I blocked it out and dismissed it as “almost molested,” because he only grabbed my penis once and he didn’t perform any sex acts on me. But lately the memories have come back up and it’s really bothering me. I have had panic attacks after having flashbacks and triggering thoughts. One time my body went numb and I couldn’t control my muscles. I tried to take a drink of water and I just dropped it. If I see anything about child sexual abuse I have to look away and I start hyperventilating. I can’t sleep at night. I have been up past 6 am for over 2 weeks now. I just sit in my phone because I can’t stand being without a distraction. Sometimes I can even feel his legs or his hands again. I can see his smile in my mind when I close my eyes. I feel overwhelming anxiety, embarrassment and shame. All I want to do is sit inside and get away from people. They can’t be trusted. Unless they understand what it’s like, they don’t care. They just tell you to go see a therapist. Like they just pawn you off to be someone else’s problem. They must just not understand how to help and it makes them uncomfortable, but it’s still extremely disheartening. The only support I have really got the has been online. My friends seem to just want to ignore it. It just feels hopeless. What some people do to others, especially children, for their own sick pleasure. Gain a child’s trust just to throw it in their face, and traumatize them for a few seconds of pleasure. I have become extremely introverted since it happened. I avoid intimate and sexual relationships because they are too stressful to even think about. I’ve never had a girlfriend, let alone had sex. I’ve had people tell me that it I might have PTSD, even in other posts I have made on this sub, and I think they are right, but I didn’t really have many of these problems, except for the introversion and avoidance of relationships, before the memories came back in early December. I read that PTSD symptoms start soon after the trauma, but it’s been 6-7 years. Is this something else? Can PTSD appear years after the traumatic event? Thank you for anyone who replies.",21Jan2020,1

it led to me getting sexually assaulted

also suffering from religious guilt about my sexuality. i just need a friend in my life that can show me i’m not the only one (not the only one that is sexual, not the only one who does these things, not the only one struggling). everyone around me seems so perfect and they’ve gotten their shit together and are so close to God and i’m here the stupid sinner who can’t get anything right",21Jan2020,1
92,"Ok, so I suffer from schizio-affective disorder, as well as aspergers. As such I often act weird or depressed.

So, some background info is needed for context I suppose.

The past few months I have been taking some new medication, and it is really helping a lot. I don't feel suicidal anymore, I feel less depressed, and I don't hear voices in my head as often. However, I find that I am more prone to wild mood changes and swings.

I have one friend, and lately every interaction with him has gone poorly. I either end up being a depressed mess worried that I keep annoying him in some way and trying my best to avoid angering him, which only serves to actually annoy and anger him, or I end up feeling really angry and pissed off and getting in fights with him. The worst part is that I don't get that way when I interact with my parents. 

I fear that if this keeps up I'll simply drive him away, and we won't be friends anymore. I don't want this. He has been a good support over the years, and is a great friend. I don't know what to do though. 

Last we spoke, I had gotten depressed and told him I would leave him be and not talk to him for a few days, so as to avoid bothering him. For added context, we both live in the same town, and have meet in person many times, but haven't done so in a long while, so this is all over text or some other chatting thing. Also, for what it's worth, he knows I have mental illnesses.

I really don't know what to do. I don't want to lose my only friend.",21Jan2020,1
93,"I understand morals, I understand society’s expectations, but I cannot truly understand them because I feel like they’re untrue. There’s many things I know that are wrong, like robbery, murder/suicide, self harm , vandalism, etc. But I can’t feel it in myself to think that they’re wrong. Nothing really matters that much to me, I can’t see how anyone’s life is valuable, and how being inconvenienced by shit like this is worth it. Of course, I’m not going to do anything irresponsible or illegal, but I just want to know how you feel it within yourself? Is it something you learn? Everyone around me seems to think (at least outwardly) in a different way to this. Sometimes I feel like I wanna act on my impulse to destroy things, it mostly ends up manifesting in me harming myself, but it’s hard not to harm other sometimes. It’s not necessarily anger fuelled, it’s more curiosity. I don’t really understand how I’m feeling

94,"Hi first time posting hoping to find a little clarity, I'm typically not the type to reach out for help and when I do my girlfriend and close friends usually give me the clarity needed, but with this current situation I believe multiple points of view would help.

I (18m) live with my girlfriend of 8 months and have a wonderful relationship as a whole as well as living together comes easy. I work as a carpenter making 18 an hour, not good but not bad for fresh out of highschool. I've typically always dealt with suicidal thoughts, and nihilism but was never medicated nor have I seen anyone, I personally dont like the idea of meds as i self medicated for a while (I understand its different) and always found the same conclusion being strength in myself and self sufficiency. As of recent I havnt had any major depressive episodes or anything of the like but life has gotten stressful. I found myself 2k in debt, a major medical situation arose with my girlfriend which also effects me personally. 

Now that the info is over here's my main issues I'm seeking advice on:

1. I have a terrible desire to invade my girlfriends privacy, earlier in our relationship that showed as checking her phone, but after being blatantly told that was totally uncool I stopped and was proud of myself. To be honest until i met her i never saw stuff like that as toxic as I've never understood the concept of privacy nor have i ever had any growing up which always gave me the mindset of privacy = hiding something. For about 4 months now I've switched my views and have respected my girlfriends privacy although I dont understand it. Now the issue with it is I dont think shes cheated bor am I doing it out of curiosity its simply I liked knowing what was going on and understanding her from her personal point of view. I still will find myself up late at night fighting the extreme urges to check her phone, I always prevail but it leaves me unfulfilled in a sense, almost empty like I'm missing something (I'm very much the type that likes to know everything and figure people out, how they think etc.) because of that I end up hating myself for dealing with these temptations because they arnt anxiety or self esteem moreso I'm just fucked up and awful and I deeply feel the need to invade privacy for my own selfish gain.

My second issue as of late is the more pressing one, I feel like a complete failure, my own confidence ive always rellied on tells me ""thats ridiculous you're 18 with a house, a dog, a cat, food on the table, a vehicle you own, a wonderful girlfriend, good musical talent, good looks, good ethic, and good maturity for your age"" but for some reason I feel like I'm always failing, not being good enough to my girlfriend after 1 slip up, being a employee for working 40 hours instead of 50, being a bad man of the house for coming in a little short on cash and we have to eat ramen, etc. This has been rotting me out from the inside I only sleep 3 hour nights, those 3 hours I have hellish nightmares, I lay in bed despising myself, my psychosis relapsed and I find myself crying wanting the hell to end wondering why I'm so fucked up yet doing so well. For example here's the dream I had last night taken from my dream journal:

""Last night I fell asleep at 3 woke up at 7 those 4 hours were spent in nightmares of me wading through rivers and oceans of my deceased offspring, they all called out asking why I created them with my fucked up genes and why I'd create atrocities, they all were spiting me for having part of me in them, and I tried to help them, and my girlfriend but I failed everytime, they all despised me and I was trying my hardest, every moment of existing there was pain and I felt it I wanted nothing else but to die yet I wanted to help my children,  and my girlfriend.  They castrated me saying it would rid the world of my weed, and that anything that sprouted from it would have myself in them and would suffer eternallybecause of it. I was paralyzed all I could do was stand and watch as these thousands of babies were tormented internally the same way I was, they were throwing themselves off cliffs, gouging at each other, anything to die but they all failed""

I'm honestly looking for clarity or really just other people opinions on this.

I should disclaim:
-This is not making me suicidal
-I want to see a doc but I have little money and no insurance 
-My mind is typically dark and extreme dreams, thoughts, or episodes of psychosis in which I witness such as above are not uncommon yet I felt like that one had meaning

95,"From the time I was about 16 until 25 I experienced nearly daily emotional swings- from elation to extreme depression.  Now that I’m 25 nearly 26, I feel almost nothing at all. I don’t have extreme highs or lows.  I miss feeling giddy/ excited/ joyful, even though those feelings were sometimes unwarranted.  And also kind of miss some of the depression;  at least I was feeling something.   I think that this change I have experienced is perhaps a hardening of the mind due to the struggle and constant rejection that comes with figuring life out.  I know that significant emotional change at this stage in life is a pretty normal experience, but I want to gather some info about what others experienced during these times in their life.  What significant changes did you notice from youth to adulthood in terms of your overall emotional state?  If you did experience a sort of numbing/ leveling out of emotions around 25, did you ever shift back to feeling like you may have in younger years?   Is this question a hopeless shot in the dark that lacks context and is open to endless interpretation? Yes",21Jan2020,1
96,"So I dated a girl a few months ago, who for all intents and purposes was an awesome dating experience for me; she was a beautiful, smart, inspiring Philipino girl who expressed after our second date that she didnt want to exclusively date me, but rather a fwb type ordeal. She relatively early on(a month of hanging out all throughout the week) expressed that she loved me(and often), and would pay for a grand majority of our dates  She had no qualms about buying me clothes(she would propose it if we walked past clothes sections whenever we went to Target); she spoiled me with affection, sex and financial security. Things didn't settle well for me, because I liked her to the point of wanting to be her exlusive boyfriend, an idea that she frequently taunted me with, via vocally pondering whether she should(literally asking herself out loud, in front of me), but ultimately deciding each time that she didn't want to commit. That didnt stop us from looking like a couple in every way shape and form. She called me ""babe"" always told me she loved me and would try to make me feel special compared to a gym trainer she was also dating(I didn't buy that I was any more special to her than he might have been). Though she was always vague about it, she spoke about the other guy she dated  as though they didn't sleep together, or like she was being exclusive to me; I assumed they did though, rather than disillusion myself. 

I decided to be grateful for what was otherwise an opportunity that most people would be happy to be in, but i couldnt help but feel...off with her. I felt so strongly in my gut that she was using me, but i kept rationalizing things with, ""well, how could she; she spoils me rotten and asks for nothing in return other than sex and dates which she funds"". She encouraged me to go to school to better myself, but at the same time, she had little emotional support for me; if I was going through a depression episode(I'm diagnosed with major depression) she had little compassion or empathy for me not being able to willpower through it during low points. She expressed that she has Antisocial Personality Disorder, as a means of apparently trying to relate to me.

One day I ask if she'd be up for doing a meditative practice with me(I regularly practice meditation; I was curious about an eye contact variation of it and did it with two other people), where I set a 5 minute timer and we sit in front of each other and maintain eye contact with one another. She had no problem maintaining eye contact with me, which i found surprising, because my prior ""eye contact"" participants could hardly do so without frequent bouts of laughter or noticeable nervous unease. At one point, I noticed a moment that really stood out to me, which I found uncanny. For only a few seconds, the muscles around her eyes seemed to fully relax and those eyes which once illusively held emotional expression now appeared as mere fleshy pinholes pointed at me. Sort of like her face was merely a mask that for a brief moment, faltered and I happened to spot it. 

Ive read amateur Psychologists online speak of Socio/Psychopaths with shark eyes and I tend to be real skeptical of Psuedo psychology, but this moment stunted my skepticism. Am I reading way too into this, or can someone provide an explanation that will satisfy my curiosity?",21Jan2020,1

99,"**2020 plan**

2020: new year, new decade, new chapter of my life. 2020 is my year, the year to improve myself. 

**MAIN GOAL: GET INTO SHAPE!!!**

**Short term**

&amp;#x200B;

* Become healthier (drink more water, less carbs, more fruit and veg)
* Join a gym
* Be friendlier with people (make new friends)
* Spend more time with parents
* Keep weekly journals
* Hand in all assignments in on time
* Spend more time on self care/digital detox
* Have a more positive outlook on things
* Less frivolous with my money 

**Long term**

&amp;#x200B;

* Loose weight
* Become more advance with boxing
* Stop biting my nails
* Go abroad
* Treat my family (gifts)
* Talk to people more (trust certain people more)
* Become more productive (create notes/plans)
* Aim for distinctions at the end of June
* Improve concentration
* Don’t get annoyed so easily

It takes in average 66 days to create new habits, so for the first 2 months stick with everything, and slowly it will be easier to carry on doing those things (resist biting your nails, drink water even when your not thirsty, smile even if you’re not 100% happy)

**Ways to loose weight**

**Food and drink**

&amp;#x200B;

* Cut back on sugar (low/no sugar)
* Cut back on starches
* Reduce appetite (eat less in meals)
* Drink 2,000 ml water a day
* Stick to water all day or low sugar squash/juice
* No “dirty” snacking between meals, only fruit or veg or health bars (low sugar) 
* No fizzy drinks during the week, only no sugar fizzy on weekend
* Only grilled salads, water and fruit at work

**Exercise**

&amp;#x200B;

* Run x2 a week (Tuesday and Thursday)
* Do at least 50 squats, 50 sit-ups, 30 press-ups a day
* Boxing x2 a week and football x2 a week

**Selfcare and skincare**

&amp;#x200B;

* Create a routine with skin (wash moisture etc.)
* Try to wear less makeup; which would clear up your skin, make it healthier and boost your self-esteem in the long run
* Maintain a good daily selfceare routine (brush hair, brush teeth, shower reguarly, change bed sheets regularly)

&amp;#x200B;

* Weigh myself everyday
* Keep a food and weight diary as much as possible

**Ways to become a better person**

**Make small everyday changes**

&amp;#x200B;

* Make the bed in the morning
* Put clothes away/wash basket at the end of the everyday
* Create a to do list if need to do something that day
* Make notes of things that had happened that day/week 

**Have a more positive outlook on things**

&amp;#x200B;

* Wake up and think “you’ve got this”
* Smile more
* Rather than assuming things think about it realistically
* Go into things positively, rather than assuming its going to be bad

**Remove any toxicity from your life**

&amp;#x200B;

* Any toxic relationships: GET RID OF THEM
* Stay clear of people who have a negative influence on your life (people who do the wrong things, whether it’s behaviour or actions etc.)

Removing any toxicity from your life will clear your mind up of having to always please people or do things for them. Cut them out of your life, do things for yourself and protect your physical and mental health.

**Management**

**Money wise**

&amp;#x200B;

* Stop being frivolous with your money, its not an ever-growing tree
* Don’t feel pressured to get something, just because everyone else is
* Remember you have bills to pay 
* Only buy things if an absolute necessity 
* Each week plan anything that may need to be brought (presents etc.)
* Make sure to be paid by people by said times

**Life wise**

&amp;#x200B;

* Make plans of things that need to be done (appointments, organising room etc.)
* Keep a weekly diary with picture (free prints each month)—&gt; to then possibly create a scrapbook of the year

100,"In a nut shell what my therapist helped me do was learn the skills I needed to manage my emotions in a healthy way. For a long time this was writing and a lot of exercise/ diet. My old therapist always recommended meditation as well, but it was never something I could stick to.

If I went back, i'd imagine i'd be forking over quite a bit of money to be told similar things my old therapist told me. The only thing I think it would be worth going for is to get on some anti depressant drugs. I don't want to get on drugs. 

Since i've been to therapy before, it helped me get out of my last bout with moderate to severe depression, i'm wondering if there will be anything different form when I went a few years ago or if I will just be told the same things again.

101,"I am a 17M. 

So this all started with this incident nearly 2 months ago, where food was stuck in my throat and i thought i night choke any second. I kept on panicking and panicking and panicking. I then developed globus sensation after 1 whole week of constant extreme worrying and stressing out. I wouldn't eat for a whole week and not exercise at all.

I would smoke weed even tho i knew i had a bad throat problem and had depersonalization and when i would get high it got worse and i got some bad depersonalization after. (I have had depersonalization before all this but it was weak and its stronger then ever as i type)

I then got over the throat problem but then developed heart palpitations. I cut out sugar and some time went by and it stopped. 

I then now got stomach cramps and gas probably related to the throat problem but i don't have acid reflux. It still probably affects my stomach somehow (my globus sensation)

Going thru all this one right after the other to the end has really freaking messed me up. I feel way more stronger depersonalization all the time, i can't eat during the evenings and nights because my throat feels worse and i cannot eat comfortably, feel stomach problems once every few days, am experiencing masturbation withdrawals symptoms, reduced sugar intake... i feel like am really going crazy especially at night times.

I already visited a psychoterapist once and a psychiatrist but I went privately and I could make an appointment online. Going there was stressful too but I was comforted by the thoughts that these are people that work with delicate matters and they'll be gentle and understanding. And they were actually great. But the problem is I can't afford a private therapy so to get one I would have to go to a public clinic (National fund) and they have not the best opinion and I can't make an appointment online, I would have to either call or go there just to find out if they actually could take me. And there's a lot of opinions about people working there that are rude etc so it makes me scared even more. I'm also afraid I won't get proper care because there are so many people, there are long lines to wait and these clinics and hospitals are often underpaid.

109,"I'm currently in therapy after experiencing rape and being in an abusive relationship (two separate people). My therapist and I have discussed that I entered these relationships because I felt that I deserved to be treated that way or was already used to being treated badly. She suggested that this may have come from my family. I've always thought my family was relatively normal and healthy, but looking back I'm starting to notice some things that were off. 

I tried running away as a child at least three times, from ages 9-12. I first started thinking about self-harming when I was 12, then actually started doing it when I was 15. 15 was when I first started considering suicide, though I didn't attempt it until 20, which was after the rape and abusive relationship. At a very young age, around 7-8, I really enjoyed drawing violent gory images and showing them to other kids, because I thought it was funny how uncomfortable it made them. I remember experiencing intense anger at my younger brothers, to the point where I imagined, in gruesome detail, how I would like to kill them. I took pleasure in imagining this and it provided some relief for my anger. I had a friend who gave me a stick that they carved into a knife, and one day I got so angry at my youngest brother that I actually stabbed him. (the ""blade"" wasn't even an inch long, it was just a cone-shaped point on the end. but it did draw blood). 

If I heard of another child doing these things, I'd think it was definitely a psychopath in the making. But I'm 21 now and I would never want to hurt anyone. I never intentionally hurt animals or people (besides my brother). I was raped at age 17 and in an abusive relationship from 18-20. The past few years have been very cold, lonely, and numb. 

It's clear to me that something was wrong with me as a child. Something must have happened or been wrong in my family that made me so angry. The two biggest themes of my childhood are loneliness and anger. I never had good self-esteem, never had many friends, was always shy and quiet. I just can't think of any specific reason that would've caused that, and it's really bothering me. Happy children don't try to run away or hurt themselves or others.",21Jan2020,1

112,"Me [22M] with my girlfriend [22F] of 5 years, humiliated, violated, and embarrassed by housing community security guard [50M]. Have I failed as a partner?


Throwaway for obvious reasons. 


But basically me and my GF were having a picnic by a pond in a gated community that belonged to our friend, Joe. We were sitting and eating a small bag of trail mix and the area wasn't messy or anything at all. 


Then this old guy comes up from behind us and tells us he's with the community's security authority and says we can't be eating on the premises. We told him we didn't know (really didn't). He then puts his hand on my shoulder and said it's still food and that it's against the rules. He then ""asked"" me to dispose the remainder of the food in the bag into the pond, which I did. He then asked who we're here with and we gave him the name of our friend and house number, which he called and confirmed that we were his guests. He then proceeds to make small talk about where we're from and such, which I went along with. Eventually he left.


The whole experience had me and my gf shaken up. I know that as I write this, what the security guard did really wasn't too bad. He basically told us that we couldn't eat by the pond, made sure we were guests and not trespassing, and moved on.


But I think there is more to it. For one, it was the fact he put his hand on my shoulder as he was talking to me. I know this doesn't constitute assault or battery, but it's extremely passive aggressive, like he was trying to get me to react or gauge my willingness to fight back. I understand people are not allowed you touch you physically uninvited AT ALL, but this kind of stuff doesn't go through your head during the heat of the moment. Then there's the fact he ""asked"" me to dispose of the food. Had he grabbed the bag and disposed of it, that would've been theft and destruction of property, but since he ""asked"" me to do it and I complied, there was no wrong doing. Again, this is the security guard being passive aggressive, and taking advantage of the fact we were naive and kind enough to be compliant with him. And perhaps the last point is that he felt the need to be a ""part"" of our world and time, by asking us where we're from and making small talk, even though we really didn't want anything to do with this guy. All in all this guy knew what he was doing, he probably knew we were authorized to be there but wanted to make us go through his BS because he had nothing better to do that day or just gets his kick out of making other people miserable. 


I keep looking back at the event and thinking about how this security guard put unnecessary stress on me and my GF. Normally if I was alone and this happened, I wouldn't care and I would've moved on by now. But because it happened in front of her, the stress has been exasperated ten fold, because now we can't think about visiting our friend or being on someone's property without having to remember this guy. We can't even watch an episode of the Simpsons, where Bort gets detained by security for stealing a video game, without thinking about this event. The experience has stressed her out as well, understandably, but we choose not to talk about, because a part of us knows that he had every right to do what he did, but another part knows he absolutely did not. 


Which brings me here today. I feel like I've failed as a partner in shielding her from such kinds of people. It's one thing to go through TSA and get your bags checked, it's another for some old jerk to come up and treat you like a criminal and essentially provoke you into an altercation. Looking back I should have just held on to the food, threw it in my bag or whatever, instead of complying with him like a coward. I should've known that he had no right to imply that I was supposed to throw it away or do anything for him. And when he tried to make small talk, I should've told him to get lost.


But my post here is not really about him. My post here is about me and my GF and how we can move on from this. Moreso how I can move on from this. I essentially allowed this guy to ruin our trip because of my naiveness and wanting to be compliant with authority and generally polite to people. I allowed this jerk to get off to harassing me and my GF. And I can't get it out of my head. I can't think about visiting a friend or taking a trip anywhere without thinking about this or having it come up in some way.


I know the security guard is not the problem here. I am. And I need help. How can I get over this? How can we get over this?

114,"Hey guys n gals of Reddit! 

I'm terrible at these, there probably won't be any order to this post but here I go... 

Context; So my ex left me last April (4 1/2 years together), grandad died a month before that, I was in a bad place, closed myself away, during the grandad's death, it hit me hard, to fucking hard.. 
Also had a hell of a childhood, abusive dad, mother who liked way to much drink and a little brother who was a golden child... 

I think as a person I changed, I went distant with everyone around me even the gf at the time.. think that was the reason for her leaving in the end among cheating on me but hey ho... 

Today I woke up with her on mind, hell she has been from time to time but I carried on and was doing well for months, feeling better, happy, more productive in general. I ended up meeting a bird and we started going out, 3 months down the line I ended  with the reason off ""I'm not feeling it"".. 
 
I find it impossible to let people into my world and my mind, I've never had someone I can just talk to and have some help, support. I couldn't trust my own parents growing up so who can I? 

I see everyone I get close is out to hurt me in some fashion so I distance myself, I feel I crave just some love, care and affection (not in a attention seeking way) but don't know how to let people in and when I did I don't know how to show it back as I just feel cold and not in it, like I'm acting to just seem normal... 

With my ex leaving me (the only I did open up to, too a point) just set my mind in this way of thinking, no one gives a shit. Even people who genuinely want to help me , I won't let them, I feel like I'm self destructive, a good thing will come my way and when I actually see it's good, I just find any possible way to not have that good part in my life.

Just writing this I feel like sometimes has lifted but I do get like, times of good and bad, but I choose to just ignore the bad and act like everything is normal, the only coping mech I've ever had is to just bottle it up, forget and carry on, I'm set in this way and now just feel I'm a bit fucked? I've contemplated therapy but doubt I could just open up to a random therapist and let them in..

115,"I'm an alcoholic. I mean that in the medical and social definition. I drink about 20 alcoholic drinks per night, every night and never ""feel"" drunk. I black out most nights (15 drinks deep) and remember nothing for 8+ hours per night (until I wake up). I'm a 27 year old man in the US. I hate blacking out and don't want to do it but drinking is the easiest, most fun time I can have on an average night. I go from sober to blacked out without even knowing it happened.

I drink with a few women that I'm interested in but they have little to no interest in me. I know this to be fact.

I know I'm drinking to forget about daily issues, hoping that time spent with these women leads to something, and for a feeling of mild euphoria. But I know the daily issues will still be there in the morning, these women aren't interested (but they're still my friends), and the pain in the morning is less than the euphoria of last night. Plus I lose several hours of memory per night.

117,"I should preface this by saying that I'm formally diagnosed with MDD and GAD, and my doctor theorizes I have BPD, although I'm not sure about that. I have some symptoms that might indicate ADD/ADHD (for those who don't know, ADD/ADHD and BPD can be easily mistaken for each other). I currently can't see anyone to get a diagnosis, so I'm confused if this is a BPD thing, or something else.

Whenever I get too sad, I feel myself become someone else. It has to be the full-on, silently crying, “I want to die” kind of sad, but if I get stuck in that feeling for too long, I change. I become agitated, impulsive, and full-on misanthropic. It's like something snaps inside me and there's a very sudden change. I have to avoid people in that state because otherwise I intentionally start very aggressive arguments, I have elaborate violent thoughts/urges, and I become incredibly bitter. I say things I don't mean, and have really messed up thoughts I usually wouldn't entertain. I have on occasion watched (and enjoyed) snuff videos in this state. I can't talk to anyone when I'm like this because I'll have nothing positive to say at all. I can barely contain myself, it's an effort not to just explode. I've acted violently in the past because of this, and whenever someone provokes me (intentionally or not) I fly off the handle.

Needless to say, I absolutely hate who I am when this mood strikes. It's always because I'm in pain, but that's no excuse. I guess I just want to know if anyone else knows what this is like or what this is. It's out of character for me and I'm not like this often.

129,"I have a history of depression through my teen years. I mostly overcame a lot of my problems through therapy and medication. I also struggled with alcohol for a while and stopped drinking little over a year ago. 

For the last three months I have been feeling incredibly depressed, anxious, overwhelmed by work and alone. It has now reached a point that I find myself considering drastic options: from dropping out of university to potentially killing myself. I don't want to do either of these things, but I feel for the first time in a very long time that I am completely out of control of my environment and that I cannot help myself. I am at a crisis point. I can't eat, sleep, work or anything. 

I am a graduate student, in a fairly high pressure environment at a new university. I do not live on campus and spend most of my free time working a part time job. Everyone on my course is very nice but due to my circumstances, I have no friends. I live with my partner, who is foreign, and due to visa issues will be leaving the country soon. This will leave me geographically and emotionally alone. I cannot speak to my family about my problems as they are very demanding and often not very sympathetic. They also blame my partner for my personal woes and claim she has 'ruined my opportunities' due to her visa situation. I stayed with them for a week over the holidays and only had rows and felt worse. 

I am very stressed by my university work. I am usually fine with this, but have recently been overwhelmed with a sense that I am not good enough, that I cannot meet expectations of my supervisor and effectively that I am destined now to fail. My university doesn't give me grades on individual pieces of work and there is strict limit on the academic support I am allowed to receive, so I have no idea how I am doing, but can only judge based on my own (low) opinion of myself. This is reflected by the fact that I don't really know what I'm doing with upcoming assignments and every time I look for academic advice it is no help. 

The depression paralyses me from doing anything and as a result all aspects of my life worsen. As a result of this, my depression worsens. I have tried getting counselling or seeing a doctor but waiting times are horrendous. I don't know what to do. My degree is for the next five months and I know I cannot live like this for five months, but also I want to get my degree (even if I barely pass). At the same time, I am so miserable - as a consequence of my family life, my partner having to leave, my own self-disappointment and a lack of a support system - that I feel like I don't have many options left. I want to drink again but I know I can't do that.

I know I need help or advice but I don't know who can give it to me and how I can articulate myself to get that help. My academic tutors are not particularly empathetic - nether are my family and friends - and the only person who can support me emotionally will soon be in another continent. 

I just needed to get this off my chest and see if there is any advice. Thanks.",21Jan2020,1
130,"I haven't had such a good Monday. I slept through Saturday and Sunday woke up at 2 am on a Monday couldn't sleep again so I just browsed YouTube. I finally came down and everything was fine until then, but you know how when you're depressed it just seems like the littlest things can result in a full on breakdown such as having a fine day, but then you drop your food and start bursting out in tears not because of the food, but because it seems you can't do anything right not even a simple thing as transporting food like that should be easy right so you just cry and cry from the buildup of everything else you have been trying to distract yourself from.

131,I made some new friends on gmod these last few days and over been having a lot of fun playing with them. Everything feels so calm and nice. And tonight we stayed up until 4 AM in a teamspeak channel watching various videos and talking about anime openings together. We argue a lot but it's more of friendly arguing and I really enjoy being on and talking to them. I feel like I actually have something to do now. I no longer just sit around having nothing to do and it's nice. I mean it is a bit stupid and weird but the game we play is fun so I think it's fine.,21Jan2020,1
132,"I know to varying degrees everyone does this. Outward aesthetic is the first impression we make upon anyone. But one shouldn't necessarily  ""define"" themself by it.

So, I'll be frank. I've always had 3 friends tops if any. Currently only my partner. All of my family is toxic and unsupportive. Even with my partner I feel alone. I feel unattractive. Untalented. And impossible of being understood by others for various reasons. I'm older (30) so making meaningful platonic relationships seems more hopeless than ever. I'm not religious, nor do I desire to be. BUT, my psychology of religion class has awakened an idea in me. Community. One of the major reasons that religious people thrive. Connecting on a level built around deep and common beliefs. 

I don't subscribe to the idea of an all powerful diety. Being bipolar, having social anxiety, and ping-ponging between anorexia and binge eating  disorder further displaces me from a more meaningful existence. 

Point: Since I've been a teenager, when I liked how I looked, I've rested almost all value in myself in my skin. My ""number"" extends beyond 120 people. I'd say... at least 60 percent of which were mistakes or misguided attempts to feel complete. I'm very sex-positive but my relationship with sexuality is fractured. If that makes sense. 

Since my relationship has begun, I've moved this way of living to the web. Showing in webcam. Again I this is something I don't believe to be bad. I don't condemn myself for doing it etc. The problem lies in placing nearly all sense of SELF in the acceptance of OTHERS. It was easy when I was young, in shape, etc. I've lost those things. It was also a way to be social without hating myself.  It was a way to ""hang out"" in person, and now on webcam, I still feel it's the only way to achieve being liked. Otherwise I feel like a ghost, largely ignored but unwelcome if seen. In a way, I feel like the living dead. The compliments fed me. 

I've gotta go for now, but that's the overall scenario. I know I'm not the first, nor the last external approval seeking stray, and I do have a therapist but still. I'm curious about THIS community and whether there are people who are similar. 

Thanks.",21Jan2020,1
133,"Some important information: I'm quite skinny but I absolutely love food. I love cooking, baking, making desserts and best of all, eat it. It's truly a source of joy for me. I'd also love for my body to be more curvy and less skinny. I've been on the skinny side for as long as I can remember, because of genetics. I don't like being too skinny, I think it makes me look ugly, and I lose the feeling of femininity. 

Now, a few years back I started working on some sides of myself that were hurtful to me and others, you know, just kind of paying more attention to my surroundings and working on being less impulsive with words. I wanted to grow as a person, and try to never ever inflict pain or uncomfortableness on others. Which is tricky when you already never intend to do so, but sometimes still end up doing so. 


So what I did is similar to the Pavlov Conditioning. Every time I got in a small argument with my friend and would end up hurting his feelings, I took away something that brought me joy. Like eating a cookie or some icecream, or making crème brulée. Like a punishment really. I figured I didn't deserve that since I just hurt my friends feelings. 
It seemed to work really, all these different instances in which I would end up hurting my friend in some way, started happening less and less. But taking away food kind of transformed itself in me just losing my apetite for the rest of the day whenever something went wrong and I ended up feeling guilty. Which I was at peace with tbh, I didn't deserve feeling happy right after I just hurt someone close to me. But every time, the next day things would be okay again, and my apetite would return again. So I never really thought of it as a big bad thing. 


But I really really hurt my friend's feelings this time. I can't completely explain all of what happened as I feel he wouldn't like me putting private things between us out on the internet, but to summon it up shortly, I'd been honest with someone, in hopes of not misleading them too long into thinking I could give them friendship. I don't like the idea of doing such a thing. But he feels the way I said it was unnecessary and flatout incredibly mean, and not my place to say that because I don't know their backstory. 


The thing is, I really, really tried my best to speak from the point of how I felt about a behavior/actions this person had displayed, what my feelings were and where they came from. I never did the ''You are this and you are that and that's why I don't feel I can like you.''-thing. I've sat about an hour in bed trying to piece the right words together.


But this person I was honest with is also very close with my friend. 


I feel horrible for having hurt his feelings that badly. I really love that friend incredibly much. As you can guess my apetite dissapeared. It's been a few days and he still hasn't spoken to me after being this dissapointed and hurt. My appetite hasn't come back yet either, I've tried to force myself to eat at least something, but after half an hour I'd feel very nauseous outta nowhere and my stomach would just throw everything out again. I feel incredibly guilty for what I did, I feel horrible for hurting my friend that badly, I feel awful for having taken away someones wish for me to like them, eventhough when I really didn't feel I could, eventhough I really just didn't see them as my cup of tea. It still feels awful to take away that hope from someone. 


The thing is, before all this, my friend found out about my apetite going away after something bad would happen and I'd feel guilty. He said he was dissapointed in me, and that he wanted me to change that because he knew it probably wasn't very healthy. 


I don't want to dissapoint him even more after the big incident, so now I'm kinda stuck in a place where I constantly feel bad for not being able to keep any food inside, but also bad when I do eat some because food really does bring me happiness. I really, really don't believe I deserve any happy feelings. 


On top of that I just feel awful for having inflicted such pain on them. I thought I was doing the right thing by being honest, but the longer he stays away, the more I'm convinced I never should've been honest. It would've been softer on my friend and the other person. 


I don't know how to get out of this toxic cycle. I don't know how to gain control over my stomach again and get to keep food inside. I hate throwing up, it's the worst. I hate how much more skinnier it's making me. I don't think it's just a stomach flu. I think this is might be a result of taking away food for too long, whenever something bad happened. How do I regain control over my stomach's reaction to food?",21Jan2020,1

138,"I was diagnosed with bipolar about 3 years ago. I had the problem for about 8 years in total. It would basically involve having these “episodes” where I seemed to lose the plot. I would talk a lot more, talk a lot of nonsense at a fast pace, embarras myself on social media by posting a lot of cringeworthy sometimes nonsensical posting, I was also violent and aggressive quite often with people who I felt were getting in the way. I felt like I was on my way to achieving greatness. I felt like I was onto a good thing. This led me to be sectioned a couple of times especially when I got violent. I didn’t really suffer with any delusions of hallucinations except possibly grandiose thinking. I would say things like “my sister is the devil” but I didn’t actually believe that it was more like she was getting on my nerves and I wanted people to believe me. I wonder if I’ve been medically “institutionalised” ie believing I am mad so acting that way. When it first happened I was getting over a break up and I was feeling very low and my way of thinking was a bit random and jumbled up thoughts and speech. But nothing extreme. I have for the past 3 years been completely stable. I have been taking antipsychotics for the whole time so I guess I can thank them for that. But I literally never got depressed except when it all started and I am ok in general now. Sure I am not perfect but I don’t think you can label my problems with having mental health problems. Sometimes I wonder if these episodes weren’t anything to do with having a disorder and maybe I was just acting a bit wild for some other reason. Anyone have some insight? Does it sound like I have bipolar or could it have been something else?",21Jan2020,1
139,"i’m a diagnosed alcoholic (i used to go on a 10 day benders, drinking enormous amounts of alcohol) and i haven’t drank alcohol in six months. when i stopped drinking after a month or so i felt like a new person. and yes, i should be (and i kinda am) proud of myself but i’ve started to regret this decision. 
i really can’t stand being sober all the time, i feel bad all the time and it’s just so hard and painful for me. antidepressants are fine but they don’t really fill the void from alcohol. so i filled that void with many other substances. 
i got arrested for having weed and i don’t even like weed. i got kinda hooked on benzos, i just don’t enjoy them that much, but i still take large amounts of pills really often. 
the reason i’m concerned is that i started to enjoy extasy and amphetamines really really much. and i used to take them for special ocassions only but now it’s getting worse. now i take them more often but it’s still not a daily thing. it makes me really sad when i realised that i actually feel normal, comfortable with myself and productive only when i’m on dangerous and very addictive drugs. 
now...for the last 3 days i snorted 8g of speed and ended up having amphetamine psychosis. the sadest part is that i enjoyed even the psychosis that comes on top of all the other shit it does to me. am i at the beggining of becoming a drug addict? i know it’s wrong and i know how bad it’s affecting my whole body but i really wouldn’t mind feeling like i feel on those drugs for the rest of my life. 
i thought my battle with alcohol would change my life for the better, but it only pushed me into more dangerous and addictive drugs. i sometimes regret that i’ve stopped drinking alcohol. maybe i wouldn’t try all these things... i just don’t know what to do anymore, these things are no more just vices for me, they became much more.

141,"For my school project today, I was forced (Just because I couldn't say no to my teacher) to walk around a shopping district with my group members, and it's a place that I had never been to. I never used to go shopping alone at crowded places and I'm absolutely never an outgoing person. Right at the moment when I was being exposed to huge crowds of people, I suddenly started crying. It just stresses me out to be in a place like that. While trying to hold my tears desperately, the more stressed and anxious i feel, causing me to stare only at the ground while following wherever my group members go by paying attention to their feet. Later that, I tried to calm myself down, telling myself that I'm just overreacting and that this is no big deal at all so I gotta stop acting dumb. But boy I was wrong, I ended up crying again instead of calming down. The people and noises around me, wet eyes and blurred vision, my head stinging, everything just gets more and more unbearable. And so I stayed like that for the whole process until it ends, I was totally worn out both physically and mentally. After my group members walked into a convenience store where there were less people to rest, I sat down and found myself a lot refreshed. (Good thing my group members were distracted and didn't notice me crying and struggling with problems like that) Also, trying to engage in a conversation with them actually made me wanted to stop trying and be alone, I felt like crying but didn't actually did until the moment my group members and I went to the shopping district.

146,"Hey im looking to see if theres any professionals on here that could shed some light... i have been diagnosed by a phsycotherapist with ptsd. But on a 8month waiting list for phsychiatrist. Anyways , im 30 , male. Grew up in a severely bad home. 

Age 0 - 3 , bounced back between my grans house and my moms house. Dad beat me with a cast when i was 4.5 i remember this. 

Ages 4 to 11 

Mother had many boyfreinds , would party and do drugs in the house , although i had younger siblings me and my older brother were locked in the bedroom from 3pm till the next morning. Typical school week. When it was the weekend me and my older brother would hide in the closet hole we made behind the dresser because when drunk my mother and her neices and freinds would come into our room , pee on us , throw us into freezing showers , try suffocate us with pillows , and at night when the partys dying out i would hear my brother getting raped and eventually me. This happened for years , and when my mother was bored she would lock me in the cellar crawl space for hours on end with the lights off. with a demonic statue. Which i eventually started to talk to. My other siblings were treated soo good and protected by my mothers sisters exc , and growing up in a small town my mother and her siblings labelled me and my older brother as the towns theives and fuck ups at AGE 11 and 13 but we didnt do any of that , i was molested in school by ms.dueck she was a TA and helped me read because i was assumed to be mute. But my jaw hurt and i was always on edge to focus in school. The teachers knew i was being abused but nothing was done! They even let the other kids , thanks to my aunty val telling the other parents how bad we were bully me and my older brother , i remember i was invited to a birthday party when i was 10 , i shoveled driveways for 2 whole days and hid some of that money minus what my mother took , i baught a wicked birthday present , i walked the logans party which was 2 miles and to be yelled at to F*&amp;^ off by his parents. I was chased with vehicles by other kids in higher grades than me. My moms freind who was gay babysat me and ny older brother , and i wish i wouldhave been babysat by my abusive cousins than this guy, his name was richard a CONVICTED CHILD RAPIST , thats all ill say. 

Then when i was 13 my mother remarried a biker , he was the devil! Also a pedophile but loved to beat the s... out of me and my older brother till i started fighting back , i was fist fighting a grown man who was 6'5 350lbs everyday till i was 18. Including everyone else. I was fine until 2 years ago just after my son was born , my saviour and the light of my life. But the last 2 years ive been having reoccurent thoughts of my son being kidnapped , raped and murdered and me having to bury his little body , this sends me into a furious rage and i begin to have severe anxiety and thoughts of murdering people who even look at him wrong with my bare hands. Im scared to finally blow up and go on a rampage. Im EXTREMELY strong , and a large man and would do irreversable damage. Whats wrong with me...",21Jan2020,1

160,"i think you should try the ***HappyNotPerfect*** app, they have amaaazing emotion guide meditations and things called daily routines. when u do a daily routine, you start off by selecting how you feel (wobbly, weird, frustrated, overwhelmed, i don't know, etc). Then there is a paper bag breathing animation which you breathe to for a couple minutes. then you write on a little notepad what the problem is. They'll ask you things like ""putting this anger aside, what are you **still** grateful for?"". You'll also get a quick mini game to stimulate the mind. Finally, there's a quick 3-minute dive-in session tailored to help you feel better a little (tailored to your emotions). it helps me so fucking much. the app is free but i paid the full version to unlock **all** their longer guided meditation sessions, sleep guided meditations, sounds, asmr, etc.

also you might wanna download ***Noisly***. it's also free. you can play nature sounds that play on forever. you can also mix different sounds, e.g. you can turn on bird chirping noises + a small river + a person's footsteps. it's amazing. again, if you pay for the full price, you're getting a **LOT** of options, but it's worth the shot!

psa im not associated to these apps in any way, though i'd love to work for happynotperfect one day!!

164,"Background story: all my life I had suffered with what I thought was anxiety and depression, I first came across the term anxiety at the age of 15 and ever since that day I’ve been fascinated by everything to do with the mind , I’m 28 now , at the age of 27 I discovered that I have a highly sensitive personality, I now had full understanding of my entire life and exactly what’s going on in my mind , I always knew I could feel and take on others emotions , I always knew if anyone came to be with a problem of any kind id take it on as if it was mine , I’ve always been able to know exactly what to do to diffuse any situation, I always new I could read every detail about a persons body language in seconds and link everything about them together to come up with one outcome ,
Over the past few years I got extremely deeply intouch with my spiritual side to try and combat all the anxiety , pretty much devoted my life to it if work was quite I’d spend the shift researching pretty much anything mind related , I’d get home and watch talks about it on YouTube , read books about it and meditate religiously every night 
I’ve had major success in myself through meditating, I find it easy to distinguish my thoughts and what they truly are . I used to get stuck in the same anxious thought patterns for weeks , now my mind seems to be able to subconsciously pick up on a negative/anxious/depressive thought train within seconds of it starting , because I know what it is and how it works I can literally choose to remove myself from the thought trail , I managed to full blown feel and talk to my inner child from my higher self , I could feel the entity of it whilst managing to speak to it from a place of serious deep compassion , I’d learnt to completely feel all bad emotion and anxiety inside myself and just letting it be there , learning to do that changed my life immensely, now I found out I have highly sensitive personality I’ve realised it was always the underlying thing causing the majority of my anxiety and it shaped me up to be who I am today , but due to all the mind work I’ve done I now find it very easy to distinguish the thought processes that are just my sensitivity and not get dragged down with them 

I feel like I have a major gift and want to use it to help others 
I regularly get people come up to me with there problems and it hardly takes me any effort at all to work out exactly what’s going on in there mind to cause it , sometimes it actually blows my mind how obvious it is to me and how they can’t see it themselves, but I’ve realised that’s all to do with me being HSP and being able to collect all the smallest of details and merge them together to reach my outcome 
I seem to be able to say sentences that people are about to say before they’ve even said a thing , on a regular basis I get people say to me ‘ how the F... did you know I was going to say that’ 
I can feel the energy of a room of people instantly ,
I can draw the mind , I’ve worked out how certain mind processes work to the point where I can draw a diagram explaining what’s happening 
I can draw a picture of the mind seeing/being a thought , I can also draw a picture of the mind observing a passing thought from the conscious 
I feel I know processes of the mind that are either majorly overlooked or are simply not known to others yet
I could ramble on and on about what I’ve noticed I feel compared to the norm

I always knew there was something different about me and I never realised until coming across the term highly sensitive personality that not everyone has these abilities! People around me can see it to 

I need help knowing what to do with all this! Currently work full time as a technician earning good money but that doesn’t do it for me whatsoever, I want to use this gift and even explore more deeply into it to help others who are struggling",21Jan2020,1

Add the fact that i had to learn a subject for the test tomorrow, and you get a mixed soup of emotions that i couldn't comprehend

It just feels like time is very limited so i would want to use it to the fullest. But because of this mindset i keep feeling like sh*t everytime the plans i have for the day is unable to be done. It really feels terrible, and most of the advice i keep getting is to let go and not make it such a big deal.

I just want to know how to handle this, or maybe if anyone has the same experiences? So far the only solution i had was just to cut my sleeping hours from 8 to 6 hours, but idk if thats ok since im still a 17 yr old teen.

My family all think I need help as I can freak out and can become really angry and desperate and really sad and just A LOT if I'm overwhelmed. I tried to jump out of a driving car around New Years.

I'm probably depressed and I wouldn't be surprised if I have a personality disorder too. I know I've been in denial for so long that as a child I got everybody fooled that I was fine, even though I ran away, threw things everywhere, said I wanted to die etc. After my episodes I can pretty much forget everything. I've only recently admitted to having a real problem as my bofriend proved it.

I've tried to tell therapists about this, and I feel like nobody takes me seriously. They've just told me that I'm probably stressed and that they agree that a lot of difficult things have happened in my life. Dad was a drug &amp; alcohol addict and my cousin took suicide when I was 16. It was hard.

What that means is, I see myself as a person without a past, no memories of mistakes, no missing skills, no screwed up possibilities. Just a person that I know nothing of except for what I see in this very moment.

And I confirm that this person has a right to enjoy themself.

Any guilty thought that pops up, any cringe about my past has to be violently pushed back and denied from being thought about, because THAT'S AGAINST THE RULES!

In November I had a manic episode along with the loss of a romantic relationship and straight up didn't go to to 75% of school that month. I can't even remember what I did during the hours I skipped, I just recall having sudden moments of clarity and realizing I had no idea where I was. I suffer from bipolar and DPDR (Depersonalization/Derealization) pretty heavily and I guess that's what happened. Now the school is threatening me with juvenile detention and my parents with court if my attendance doesn't improve. And honestly? Fuck them.

I just can't find it in me to care about school, or that I'm ruining my life, or that my brain will keep trying to kill me. It's not that I don't care, it's that I literally cannot. I've been through so much horrible shit, survived 6+ suicide attempts in the span of 4 years, succumbed to (and fought off) a drug addiction last year, and I just want a break. I have tried talking with the school seeking help and they never *help*. I don't cause issues for anyone but myself so they always forget about me.

I highly doubt I'll graduate at this point. I've seen other kids get put into specialized classes, coddled, all to help them graduate, kids who aren't doing nearly as bad as me, and I'm still left behind and forgotten. I simply don't care about graduating anymore. I'm not even suicidal right now, and I haven't gone back to drugs, but I just want a long rest because this is all so tiring.

She thinks she is the reason trump is being impeached, that she’s behind the uprising in India, and that Russian Spies are out to get her. I suspect Bipolar 1 w/ delusions triggered by stress (she had just started a new job, which she was promptly fired from). 

Problem is, she thinks she’s totally fine. Gets extremely hurt when people don’t believe her and threatens to cut us all out, which she did for a terrifying 4 day period during which she drove 3 states away and appeared at my door step on the other side of the country with no car anymore (abandoned the car and flew.) she refuses treatment, and the mere mention of it right now is enough to almost loose her to ya entirely. She does not seem to be an immediate or clear danger to others- and not her self (not suicidal or anything, and has periods of total lucidity). 

Any advice on how to keep her safe, get her treatment? She also has periods where she thinks she’s a billionaire and is spending money like it too (tipped a server $100 yesterday.) she’s crashing with me for the time being, but can’t stay here forever (i have housemates).

Amyways, so i took part in A few items, Javelin, Discus, shot put and 100m sprint. Originally i just would have took part in shot put and 100m sprint, but i decided to try a few other things. I wanted to try hurdles again, but i didn't because of an old knee injury, so i didn't want to risk getting hurt unnecesarily as i am in a provincial team for indoor cricket and i don't want to mess it up. But anyways. So i got in for javelin and shot put and idk about the 100m yet. I was very anxious before running the 100m, but instead of fueling those negative thoughts i tried saying positive things to myself like i am strong i can do this etc, it calmed me down, and even if i didn't win, i was pretty fine with my result. I just did it for the fun anyways. Me and my two friends spent the day together. For once in a very long time i was genuinely happy.

181,"Hi. I've struggled with mental health most of my life. Recently, through meds and therapy, I've gotten much much better. Depression, ADHD, and anxiety are all things I'm familiar with. 

I have a friend who is currently feeling pretty low. She was just venting to me about how she is a terrible person who doesn't deserve to be happy. She thinks she's awful because she has intrusive thoughts and that any mistake is indicative of being a bad person. I have tried extensively to explain to her that it's not true and that she should actively avoid her triggers because she doesn't deserve to be so unhappy but she only picks out small pieces of my words to fight against and ignores the valid points I've made. She claims that she is ""abusive"" towards me and that I'm brainwashed to see the good in her. And, yeah, our relationship used to not be the most healthy in large part to her actions, but she has since apologized and made a noticeable effort to improve which I thought was amazing! Thought she still sees her past mistakes as her being a bad person. She says her mom says she is a bad person and abusive and her mom ""must be right"" because she knows her best even though her mom has certainly proven to be a pretty toxic person herself. I recognize a lot of her thought process as how I used to act not too long ago - before I finally got meds that work for me. I know how awful she is feeling and it makes me sad for her to say these horrible things about herself. I have said countless times that I think she should have meds and she agrees, but she hasn't fought for them because her parents don't want her to have them (she's 18). She goes to therapy every other week but can't this week due to another commitment. That'll be three weeks without therapy while she's feeling so low. I've told her that she needs to call her therapist and schedule an appointment for another day this week but she won't because ""she has gone without her for months at a time before."" I've asked her if she is feeling the urge to self harm and made her explicitly promise to seek help the second she does, but I still don't want her in such a horrible headspace. When I felt that way, I certainly would have broken promises like that if I felt like I had to.

Basically I'm trying to say that she says it's not an emergency so I don't have grounds to call in help for her. Is there anything I CAN do? I've reassured her so much but she picks and chooses my words to make her point. I don't think I can talk to her parents because they both don't take her mental disorders seriously. I thought maybe I could call her school but the ""counselor"" there is notoriously horrible and the secretary isn't much better (first hand experience in both). I do know who her therapist is... but I don't want to call if it's an invasion of privacy. I might be overreacting, but I really don't think so. She's looking at herself through a horrible filter! And on top of it all, it's giving ME some anxiety. Nothing major that I can't handle, but I don't like her saying that she's abusive towards me. I know I have to worry about myself first and foremost, and I am, but I want to be able to do something! Ugh... I just hate seeing my old self in her. I was NOT okay.

184,"I've been having mild hallucinations for a little over a year now. I'm 19, F, and had been in therapy from the end of Junior year until a little bit into my freshman year of college. When I first got into therapy I had a diagnosis of Cyclothymia and two anxiety disorders, and then they changed my diagnosis to (complex) PTSD. 

I had been going to my guidance counselor for months over my awful mood swings, because they were so intense I would go from so hyper, happy, amped up and wired that I felt fucking amazing, to so miserable I literally wanted to self harm and/or quit breathing just to make it stop, back and forth, like five times a day. I did it twice in a class period and it was such a rapid change in mood it left me exhausted and overwhelmed and tired and sick of feeling how I did. The highs didn't make it worth it when I knew I'd just come crashing down so hard. 

Eventually I started dissociating like really intensely. I felt like I was high on marijuhana before I'd ever even smoked it. Now that I have it felt a lot like that, mixed with being hyper, or sometimes just by itself. I spaced out so much even my boyfriend said I seemed like I was stoned at school and I'd never even touched weed at this point. I couldn't focus enough to hold a conversation at times - I'd forget what I was saying, I'd forget the sentence someone just said to me, I felt floaty, you get the idea.

I started hallucinating, too. It started with dark spots in my vision - but it got worse and worse the more I got worse with my dissociative problem. Theyre both types of psychosis so it makes sense. My therapist told me it was likely due to my severe anxiety - I'm hypervigalent and get chest pains all the time from it even when I feel generally normal. I'm worried I might have something worse than just PTSD though, because the longer I'm off my medication the worse and more frequently they happen. I drove to the nearby city when I wasn't supposed to and my car broke down and I started crying because I was terrified my parents would find out and I full on hallucinated little flecks of light in the top of my vision - almost like embers, but not as round or big and they came and went like shooting stars but smaller and without much of a trail. I see dark spots all the time, including light spots, some are bigger and less opaque, some are smaller and like blotches of darkness - they're really fleeting, they never last more than a few seconds, if that, and when they first started it was maybe a few times a day. Now, it's every day, every hour, usually multiple times an hour. They're not anything severe, because it's just warped versions of light and dark, I'm not seeing like, people or animals or things that aren't real, and I can recognize it as fake, but they're increasing in frequency and I'm worried they're going to increase in severity. Today while I was waiting to talk to a hiring manager for a job I know I'm getting, I hallucinated, but this time it was like a genuine shadow. Normally the shadows I see aren't realistic and are completely out of place, but I saw a shadow all the way across the floor and up part of the wall like the sun came out for a second depsite it being cloudy as fuck - the sun definitely didn't come out. I'm worried I might have something more severe than just anxiety induced hallucinations but I have nothing to compare this to and I don't know exactly what I'm asking. I guess is this similar to the experiences of people who developed more severe disorders? I'm just worried, I've never heard of anyone having so many hallucinations just from anxiety.

At some point I was on Lexapro and Abilify for my anxiety and psychosis. I'd dissociate so hard I'd feel like I could just stick my hand through walls or my bedsheets (but I woildn't try because I knew it was crazy and it'd just snap me out of it really hard). Taking those made my dissociation fade significantly, as well as my hallucinations, and everything else. I certainly don't attribute the medication to my declining mental health. I started them after I began hallucinating too and now that I'm off it makes sense it's getting worse.

I have abusive parents who are manipulating my grandmother so I can't attend therapy or get back on my medication right now, but I have every intention to after I leave for University and live on campus.",21Jan2020,1
185,"Okay here goes: I've suffered with chronic , debilitating anxiety disorder and severe OCD, with undiagnosed low mood for about the last three years. I'm currently split between two sides.

The thing is though that I know I'm mentally ill. I know this because it's not normal to go to places full of happy people and you feel surreal because you're sat there having suicidal thoughts (even if you don't act on them I feel like any comments about suicide need to be taken seriously )-Its also not normal to strike your face/head with your fist repeatedly most days.

I’m supposed to graduate highschool this year and I’m worried that due to me missing so much school, it may impact my chances to graduate. I don’t have bad grades. My grades are pretty average. I still try to keep up with my work but I always fall behind cause I’m super stressed and anxious. And I’m just unhappy with my life and myself. I’ve been feeling depressed to the point I’m getting physically sick. And it just sucks. 

I don’t want to miss school. But I can’t get myself to go. My mom is starting to get mad at me for missing so much school due to my mental health baggage but I’m not getting any treatment.  She kinda just says “take some cbd honey and just go to school.” I’m just stuck and I think my friends have given up trying to help me. Who I considered my best friend (who’s also my ex) barley talks to me anymore. My other friends have gotten into dungeons and dragons and don’t really invite me to things. My friends used to be what kept me going to school but now I feel like I’m an annoyance now. I’ve had many times I’ve broken down during lunch and no one really bats a eye. It’s just a “oh she’s crying again” and get eye rolls. And now I’m nervous about talking about my mental health to people. I honestly just want a hug and someone to talk to irl. Cause being stuck in my head is god awful. And I rather isolate myself than be an annoyance. 

I don’t know that this really is. A rant vent thing? I haven’t been thinking clearly at all so I’m sorry if this is kinda cluster fuck of words.",21Jan2020,1
187,"I started therapy last week after years of putting it off. I 29 (m) have been living with depression and PTSD since I was very young, it was covered up through addiction to all sorts of substances. Last year was pretty bad, I started to use heroin (iv). Today was my 2nd therapy session and we spoke about connecting to my inner child, I was hesitant at 1st but kept on talking. After the session, I wanted so much to go to the nearest pub and drown out what was brought up. I chose not to and looking forward to my next session. Even though the subject in therapy is some of my darkest days, I'm willing to talk through it and heal where possible to get the monkey of my past off my back.",21Jan2020,1
188,"So I recently met a friend in an online bipolar chat. I gave him my IG and he saw my transformation picture (where I had a side by side, of me underweight and of me now). He ignored all my recent photos and messaged me to say ""wow you used to be hot. was that a year ago?"". I immediately felt like i'm unattractive now and started crying. 

He kept claiming that he didn't know I had an eating disorder, but I feel like he was still wrong to say ""you USED to be hot"". Since I met him in a bipolar support group, and he claimed to have had a crush on me, he should have been more supportive.

What do you think of this situation? Was he a jerk or was it a misunderstanding?",21Jan2020,1

190,"Lately I've been having really negative thoughts to the point of considering suicide. 

I don't have a clue why. 

Things seem to be looking up. I got out of my fucking crazy relationship with my abusive ex, I started recording my debut album with my band. I met a fucking fantastic girl who makes me feel things I've never felt before, even when I had been in happy relationships.

But something's sorely missing. I keep feeling so fucking low and angry. The last half hour of college today was really stressful and it put me in such a bad mood. Little things seem to be setting me off and I'm getting so tired of it all. I've been barely sleeping at night, waking up in the middle of the night, unable to sleep anymore.

I feel like I'm making a bigger deal out of it than i should. I feel like i should just get over it. On the surface things seem like they're going well for me. But everything's moving too fucking slow and too fast at the same time. I hate where i live, but i know i wouldn't really be any happier anywhere else and i'm too young and don't have the money to go anywhere else. 

I should be happy. I fucking should be. I have so many reasons to be happy and yet i'm just fucking not. The closest I get to happiness is when I'm around my girlfriend, but we only see each other once or twice every week or so. 

I don't know what to do or who to tell or how to act and its fucking draining me. 

I wouldn't kill myself, but the thought is so tempting sometimes. I know theres no good that could come from it but fuck me i don't want to be here. I'm safe and will remain so but i just want these feelings to go away. I want to feel like me again.

194,"As title mentions and my previous posts will show I went for an MRI to rule out possible MS and instead was immediately referred to a Neurologist for unspecified abnormalities.  My current PCP won't elaborate on what that means so anxiety has taken over.

Part of me thinks, Thank goodness, I'm not completely losing my mind amd there is something causing all my symptoms.

The other part of me screams, but what is it?  Is it serious, is it something that can be treated, is it nothing and I'm starting back at square 1 to find the root of my symptoms?  As you can see I can literally keep going with questions.

I know I've been told to wait and let the Neurologist review the findings and to push the thoughts out of my mind as there is nothing to confirm or deny.  If only it was that easy.  Part of my anxiety is obsessive thoughts.  I can't even focus on conversations nor do I want to.  I want to sleep and I want to not handle people.  I want to hide in my room and make no decisions about anything.  

My PCP has doubled my anxiety meds and I'm hoping they can start working soon.  I want to function and I'm at a point that I'm not sure what is my actual symptoms and what is just anxiety.  I need help to figure out how to redirect my focus.

197,"This is actually something that happened about 5 years ago, but it's just only occurred to me that I never dealt with it. Especially as it was kept secret at the time, and I never really talked about it when it was all over, so if it's OK I just want to get this off my chest. Maybe some of you understand and need to know you're not alone too.

One night a group of us went out for my friend's birthday, and 4 of us ended up back at my place. We were talking and laughing and making jokes and the birthday boy played my ukele (very well actually) late into the night. It was that happiest I'd felt in a while, I'd actually attempted suicide myself a few weeks prior but I was working on my shit. No-one knew about it. 

One of the group went to use my ensuite bathroom. We all carried on for a few minutes and then something felt really, really wrong. For some reason, I remembered what I'd tried to do and that sent me into a weird panic. I ran over to the door and just started hammering on it. We'd been drinking, so I don't think I realised how crazy I must have looked and I was sure my friend was in danger. I was shouting his name but he didn't answer so I yelled that I was coming in and shoved my way in.

My friend had hung himself up inside my shower using his jacket for a noose. He was struggling and his face looked totally different, like he was someone else. I screamed and threw myself in there to get him down, but I clearly remember that his hands came up to meet mine and he helped me untie it faster, I could barely reach him. 

The friend who's Birthday it was came rushing in when I screamed, but our other friend was trapped in my room because she was sat on my bed too far away from her wheelchair. I vividly remember the sound she made as she screamed and cried and begged us to explain what had happened. I just kept repeating his name over and over. It's all I could say. 

Between us, we got him back into my room and he wouldn't speak. She was distraught with worry but he wouldn't talk to any of us. I asked him if I could please tell her and he nodded. I told her that he was trying to kill himself. She fell apart. I think we all did.

We got ready to take him to hospital and at the last moment he got up and tried to leave. He said if we tried to take him, he would leave my flat and go kill himself somewhere else, but if we left him alone, he would stay and not do it again.

It's one of the toughest decisions I have ever made. We knew we couldn't make him go. He was too big and strong for us to in force into a taxi. I checked his throat to see if he'd done any noticable damage and asked him a load of questions about whether he was breathing OK. 

Eventually he calmed down with some persuasion and he stayed at my flat. He made everyone else go home (otherwise he would go kill himself). 

I talked with him and gave him a huge hug. It started to get light out and I bit the bullet. I said that I think we need to tell someone what he's feeling, so that he can talk to them and get some support. He threw me onto my bed and my head banged against the wall. He stormed out of my flat before I had chance to stop him. He yelled that if I told anyone, if any of us did, we knew what he'd do and it would be on our hands. I followed him out into the street crying and begging him to come back inside so we could talk. I was barefoot and it was raining and it hurt like hell to walk on the stones but I just kept following him and begging him to come back. I kept telling him I was sorry.

Eventually he stopped and turned to face me, quickly raising his fist, about to punch me. I really did fall to pieces then. He didn't hit me, but I could see on his face that he would have if I hadn't given up.

It wasn't the only time in our friendship that he had been violent towards me. And I think that's part of why I find this event so hard to deal with. I have a lot of complicated feelings for what I saw, and what happened. Him and I were incredibly, incredibly close, and I loved him so much. I still see it in my head sometimes, what he looked like, just struggling, blank faced and I feel so many different things.

We aren't friends now. But I know he's alive. He's tried to reconnect on occasion but after how violent he's been with me, for my own sake I've had to keep away. I feel guilty for that, but I know I've had more than my fair share of violent men in my life. I simply can't take anymore.

But I do hope he's doing much better now, and is seeing a therapist.

I try to get them all the help they so badly need, whether it be therapists, or AA, or committment to an inpatient unit, but they all refuse the help. They continue going about life in denial.

I was living on my own three years ago and working at an insurance company when I got laid off. I freaked out and became extremely depressed. I spend several months working jobs at different grocery stores and Target, and most of them I quit just by not showing up one day.

I'm extremely stressed about building a career for the long term, and it feels like so big a task when I don't even have a clear idea of what I want. I get overwhelmed and stop trying. And then I end up frantically trying to get work in fields that I know play only to my weaknesses because it is what I'm familiar with.

My dad nagged and guilt tripped me for months to move back in with him and work as a merchandiser at a company he's been with for 35 years. In doing so I lost the unemployment benefits and mental health counseling I was receiving. I really hate living with him for a number of reasons and hated that job even more. I want to be independent and be out of that shitty small town forever. 

My dad is an alcoholic and impossible to get through to. I could get another job but I would still be in the same place. I could get my own place but I would still be in the same place with less money than I'm giving my dad as rent. I'm stuck and can't do anything. I have no support network or friends. I've put all my friendships on hold until I'm independent again. My mom is also unstable and controlling. She demands that I live within an hour of her and cusses me out about how I'm lazy and being enabled for living with my dad.

I know I need to do something for myself and fast. All of my ""dream careers"" require grad school, which I don't have the money or references to get into.

My parents had a not so happy marriage early on. My older sister lived far away from home since I was young because of college, she was a very successful kid and really smart. My youngest sister was lucky she was born when my parents reconciled and be happy together a gain. 

So during the time they were absent and reappear in my life it were pretty rough. They were very verbal towards each other and towards me. I got hit here and there occasionally. So to sum it up, verbally and physically abused. 

Now that I grew up into a decent person, we left all the past behind and live for the present. We love each other and I forgave them about everything. Now we are on good term and I love them dearly, it just seems like I can’t totally shake the past out of me. It had a very huge impact on my personality that I have trouble with trusting people, I’m emotionally unavailable and I have fear of intimacy. 

Now as I am getting older I feel it’s hard to be in a relationship when all I want is to act like a strong independent woman with pretty masculine looks and in the same time fishing for men validation, but not to date them tho. I will run away once someone wants to emotionally get closer to me. 

So please tell me. I want to get help but don’t know where to begin with. 

A therapist? Psychologist or straight to psychiatrist right away? 

Or just wait until it heals itself?",21Jan2020,1
215,"Gonna get straight to the point since I like most people here are looking for a spaghetti of armchair diagnoses and ideas. So basic facts:
 - Diagnosed with DID
 - No hallucinations in my/our life 
 - Not a drug user of any kind. 
 - Not delusional in any known ways and have shown no real set of signs for schizophrenia 

Now to the crux of the post. I/we feel a strong sensation that we are not “in” the world. Like physically speaking I/we don’t feel present wherever we are. The best I can explain is it feels as if there is some coating or barrier over us that prevents us from I guess feeling like we are a physically part of the environment around. Additionally our sight feels as if we’re looking at the world through a monitor. Kinda like the “off” sensation one can have when looking through the camera of an FPS video game(although that’s often because the camera is centered in the model). 

We’re unsure if this is a symptom of dissociation or something else entirely. It does feel comparable to the dissociation experienced as a result of the DID.",21Jan2020,1
216,"Within a few days of developing feelings for someone, I already want to marry them, I get furious when I find out they are with someone else if they are, I can’t stop thinking about them, and I just want them all to myself. I developed a crush on a guy just after seeing one photo and that instantly made me swoon. I wanted to marry them, find out what kind of women they like, if they are single, and then try to get them to notice me. Then when I find out more about them such as their interests, hobbies, and personality I start to get obsessed. It sounds like I’ve never been loved before by my parents or was abused in the past but I was not. I was pampered and loved to death when I was younger. I’ve been rejected but I’ve never had a serious relationship until  this year and we are still together. Right now it’s a pretty serious relationship and we love each other very much, even though I feel like we are drifting apart as of late. Even then I still find myself falling in love with other people almost all the time.",21Jan2020,1
217,"My days pretty much go like this: I wake up, tired, but force myself to get up and deal with it and try to complete the activities of the day. School helps, because I have to go there - otherwise my attempts to do something productive fail in maybe an hour. I used to be a very studious person, now I'm stuck in a limbo where I'm motivated 10% of the time and after that burst of energy ends I completely lose all the physical and mental energy for anything, motivation flies out the window, I just can't bring myself to do anything - even if I'd want to. 

I have finals and entrance exams for uni really soon, so it's a pivotal point for my future. Doesn't help: I won't pass with just an hour of motivation a day. I want to do so many things in life and I feel like I'm throwing all my time and potential away by loafing around like this. I'm not going anywhere. My whole life has been static for around a year, and every time I try to change something up I lose motivation in a matter of minutes. I'm starting to feel hopeless about my future for not accomplishing anything.",21Jan2020,1
218,"Hi everyone! I'm a 25 year old woman. I've had mental health issues for half my life by now. Mostly stress and low energy related complaints. Right now I'm not in any therapy as I've had so much therapy over the last few years that it felt like the same things being repeated over and over, even in intensive fill time group therapies.

One thing that I never considered a huge issue and never really discussed in my therapy sessions is that I have frequent nightmares (almost every night). Well, not really nightmares, more like bad dreams. Things going wrong, mostly mundane but slightly important things (like missing an exam in school, disappointing a loved one, missing a flight, giving a bad concert, being left alone by friends). There's no monsters, noone is dying - but it's always incredibly stressful and I feel more and more like these dreams are a huge contributing factor to two things that are and have always been huge issues (except when I was on sleeping meds): Waking up frequently during the night and being extremely tired and struggling to get up in the morning (in more 'productive' times of my life I've always been a morning person).

One thing that might be important to note is that these things are always related to current events. Like if I have an exam, I can guarantee dreams about it will happen at some point leading up to it. Also, if I read a book or play a game or watch a movie this will almost always come back in these dreams and never in a good way (often I'm in a similar predicament to the antagonist, for example). I wish I could do something about this but I could hardly avoid all forms of entertainment.

I was wondering if this is something others recognize, and what my options are to prevent these bad dreams (or at least how to handle them). Most information online is targeted at full-out nightmares but that's just not the case. But that doesn't mean that these dreams aren't causing me a lot of trouble...

222,"Okay so my grandfather recently passed away and my reaction has been unexpected. Emotionally, I haven't felt as sad as I should be because I'm close. Due to my history I know that it's not based on having some sort of antisocial disorder, I know very well I can feel empathy and sadness over loss. This isn't to say though that I have been well off mentally afterwards. Instead of feeling sad, I feel anxiety over the events of his passing. When he passed, he was having breathing problems and at first it seemed like he was just having a panic attack. Except as you can tell, it ended up not being the case. He fell to the ground and was taken away by the ambulance and announced dead by the time we got to the hospital. 

What this ended up doing to me was effecting my anxiety and OCD. I always had an innate fear of not being able to breath, I used to be able to take a deep breath to convince myself I'm fine and then relax. After this happened, the need to do this kept coming and coming. I spent days constantly taking deep breaths and panicking every time it wasn't a full deep breath. I did this so much it feels like I strained muscles that are involved with deep breaths to the point I can't even do it at all right now. If I try to take a deep breath I feel a sort of strain that stops it from going all the way. I can't really explain it except to say that I don't have any other symptom such as coughing or even regular breathlessness, it's just an inability to take a deep breath that feels like it's because I've overexerted myself doing it constantly for days on end.

Whenever these episodes were at their strongest, I started thinking of the events surrounding my grandfather and start thinking it's going to happen to me. All the details involved with him come to my head and I start to think something to the effect of ""this is it, it's happening"". I start thinking about how this could effect my mother I look at my cat and get scared that I won't be able to care for her and my anxiety just heightens. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if this doesn't make any sense, if you have any questions I can clarify. But what I wanted to know is first of all, can this trauma block any other emotion mentally? 

And also, am I right to assume my constant deep breathing has made my breathing worse?

Any other advice would be nice, or even replies that relate to this in any way or fashion.",21Jan2020,1
223,"When people think its their own semi conscious effort right? And it's just them thinking either sad, happy, or mad thoughts. These past few years I no longer experience this now my thinking is broken into three different voices(?) Like they arent auditory voices but like mental ones. As in there's ""my"" voice in which I manually think(if that makes any sense at all) and there's the other two which work without any effort on my part. One is very pessimistic, negative and cynical, but is very logical and practical in dealing with information. Then the other is extremely arrogant and dismissive of other people and their issues, to the point of being cruel and self serving. The thing is sometimes these voices can hold discussions with me and with one another and sometimes speak simultaneously. I know this cant be normal and I cant just google it either, does anyone have a clue what's wrong with me?",21Jan2020,1
224,"So, for the last few months (I’d say it started in August and gradually became worse) my mental health was very bad. I didn’t want to talk to anyone, I lost interest and didn’t get pleasure from anything I usually enjoy, my grades slipped, I felt like a bother to everyone, and basically just felt like a crappy and pathetic human being. Did I think about ending it? Yes, although I didn’t have the urge to act on it. They were just passive thoughts. The thoughts crossed my mind several times a day and I felt like I was going insane. Like I was constantly on the verge of a full in breakdown, and would blow up on the next person that annoyed me. I gave up on important aspects of life and it sucked so much.

The thing is, I thought I would never get past it. I had accepted that I was just going to be a failure and that nothing really mattered because we all have the same fate anyway. Besides, I think a part of me thought I was going to end it early anyway. Why try if that’s the case? Those months were the hardest of my life.

Turns out I was wrong. Not about those months being the hardest - they definitely were - but about me never getting through it. See, I was in such a pit of despair and hopelessness that I didn’t there would be a point where things would change. However, about 2 weeks ago something just changed. My whole outlook on life is different. Sure, I could go on believing what my brain tells me. I could keep believing that I’m worthless, annoying, a bother, and stupid as crap. Truth is, someone could tell me good things about myself as much as they want. That won’t change anything. What *will* change things is me choosing to believe it. 

Am I saying I am completely 100% better? No. I still think those things about myself sometimes. I still have the urge to give up and say heck with this. I’m just better at fighting it. I tell myself that it is just my brain messing with me. I want to be happy and nobody can truly make that happen except for me. Sure others help, but ultimately it comes down to me. Me sitting around telling myself negative things about myself won’t help. I feel happier now. I also feel as though I’ve changed. Matured more even. Going through those dark times has helped me appreciate life more.

The point of this wasn’t for me to tell you how much better I’m doing. The point is, if I can getter better after going through that (and trust me it was hard) I believe all of you can too. It might be harder for some of you but I believe in you. You can do it. Don’t drag yourself down. You’re a great human being. I know the fight is hard and you’ll want to give up, but you can’t. You’re strong, capable, intelligent, and you can get past this. I know you can. You just need to believe it too.",21Jan2020,1

230,"Kinda long, and not sure of the rules, so I apologize in advance if I break any.

My name is Dustin, I'm 21 years old. For my entire life, I've always had a disconnect. I've never felt emotionally attached to my parents (I'm adopted, at birth, idk if that is relevant). I didn't have any sort of traumatic experience growing up, and my parents always treated me how a parent should. Despite this, I don't have a connection to my mom, dad, brother, or sister. I understand that they are family and I must ""love"" them, but I just don't. People don't understand how I never miss my family, or never want to call them up and ask how they are, I simply don't care, which is the opposite of my mom, who is always wanting to check up on me and ask how I am.

It's the same with friends, my entire life I've never been able to connect with anyone, except a few people. The few people that I have been able to connect to, I deeply love and cannot picture my life without them. My best friend Connor, who is basically my brother, is currently the only person that I really feel any sort of emotion and love for.

I have never felt any sort of empathy for other people unless I am extremely close to them. I don't care when I hear about someone dying, I don't care about starving people in other countries, I don't care about social issues that don't involve me, I understand their importance, but I just don't care because it doesn't effect me and I hate it. 

It's almost like I've been a robot my entire life. I don't really show facial expressions, I'm unable to laugh or find things funny, and again, I don't care about the people around me. Honestly, I've come to hate people. I can barely go outside without getting annoyed because in my brain everyone else is stupid. I have no aspirations, I'm currently working right now, not going to school, and have no dreams and can't think of anything I'd want to do with my life.

Honestly, I feel like I'm some sort of sociopath, maybe not 100%, but varying degrees of it. I don't fantasize about murdering people, and never would, but I do know that if I did I wouldn't feel an ounce of guilt about it. All I would care about is the consequences and jail.

I know this is long, and basically me just ranting, but I was hoping some of you would recognize symptoms and be able to direct me to help. I'm tired of having no feelings, not caring about a single soul except myself, and overall just feeling a lack of consciousness inside of me. I've read about Anti-social personality disorder, and the symptoms are 90% what I experience, so that's what I've been thinking I may have. Any advice would be appreciated, and again, sorry about this being so long and I'm sorry if I broke some type of rule, I'm new here.",21Jan2020,1

233,"Hi, I'm 19F, and haven't been on medication in about six months. I guess I'll start from the beginning. In 8th grade I was having problems with an eating disorder and self-harm, continuing to relapse off and on for a few years after. I was very depressed and anxious all the time. When I was a junior, my guidance counselor I saw every other day due to my awful mood swings and feeling helpless about it, recommended I see the in-school therapist we have on campus. 

I started seeing her because I had awful mood swings between being depressed and borderline manic, where I would cycle between feeling so elated, and energetic, and happy, and wired, my mind completely racing to being so fucking depressed I wanted to hurt myself or felt like there was no use in being alive - they were really extreme mood swings, and had nothing to do with my menstral cycle which is irregular as fuck due to PCOS. My therapist gave me a diagnosis of cyclothymia, generalized anxiety, and social anxiety. I remained unmedicated but in therapy for a while at which point my diagnosis actually changed to CPTSD as we started talking more about my past and saw how dissociative I really was. 

Dissociation came on pretty gradually - I remember doing it once in middle school and it really freaked me out back then. Eventually though I was having dissociative episodes so strong I felt like I was high on weed, and this was before I had ever tried it. I wouldn't be able to focus, I'd forget what I was talking about in the middle of speaking, lose my train of thought, forget what someone said right before the last sentence they spoke, I couldn't listen no matter how hard I'd try because my mind would go totally blank. I'd feel floaty, things would feel unreal, I'd feel unreal too. These started maybe once a day but it got to where I was dissociated pretty much constantly, and this was between therapists. 

At one point before or right around when I began dissociating so hard I was having these really traumatic, really severe nightmares that still confuse me because it was more like sleep paralysis. They started out when I heard someone carrying a foldable metal chair downstairs, and I assumed it was one of my parents early in the morning, and then I felt really ominous and uncomfortable knowing I had to be having a nightmare because they wouldn't do that. They got to where there would be this presence of something, more like an entity that had no real shape or any way to be seen other than how it made you feel, and it would make it to where I couldn't move or talk and I'd be paralyzed with fear trapped underneath it, it would say awful things to me. Eventually I could move, it would get to where I'd just be trying my hardest to wake up to avoid it but it'd track me down and make me feel so fearful, and these weren't just like you wake up and it's over. I'd wake up, and think I was awake, until I ran into it again, and again, and again, and I'd fall asleep or wake up like 7 times during one actual nightmare, and they were so realistic and confusing I woke up and felt scared I was still in a nightmare for three hours after I really woke up. They got more and more violent until it was literally assault. I'd do this is the time of sleeping for 7 minutes, once it was just two minutes before I jolted awake again. I'd fall asleep staring at my phone because I didn't want to fall asleep and I wanted to see if I could figure out how quickly I'd start dreaming. It was really bad, and really confusing, and I'd avoid sleeping for as long as I possibly could. 

Some time after my dissociation got so bad, I also began hallucinating. My therapist told me it was due to how severe my anxiety is, which makes sense, because I do it signifiganctly more when I'm stressed or crying or upset. The first really noticible one I had was when I drove to a nearby city without having permission to, and having the cars serpintine belt snap on the interstate and having my car eventually die in the middle of downtown. I'm terrified of my parents, they couldn't know I was there. I had a slight panic attack and started crying and shaking and I also hallucinated something much more vivid and aparent than any weird shadow blotch of light thing I had before. It was like a ton of embers were in my upper periphreal vision, but they were more skinny and flat like shooting stars than they were embers, but they were really short, sharp flashes going in all sorts of directions, like skinny peices of glitter confetti but miniature in this bright yellow white glow. It lasted longer than anything I've experienced again yet. I started out seeing dark spots in my vision, some of them are weird shaped blotches of darker spots, some are smaller, and more opaque, usually circular but sometimes lines and colors going across my vision, and light spots which are usually much much tinier or are total flashes in my vision, always in random places, and none have stayed more than three seconds, and most vanish before a stopwatch would hit one second. This began with maybe one noticable one every two or three days, then two, then every day, then a few times a day, then every day every hour multiple times an hour. 

Once I began hallucinating more frequently I started taking Lexapro and Abilify. It helped me a lot - I quit dissociating almost completely, my memory improved drastically, I could focus, and think clearly, and I quit hallucinating completely. ((Unfortunately my parents are quite literally abusive, narcassistic, and horribly uneducated. Despite living with my grandmother since 9th grade, once they found out I was on antidepressants, they forced me to live with them in an unfinished house (no floors, appliances, ect.) with them and off my medication and made me so suicidal I had to leave and am back with my grandmother that's skipping a TON of important traumatic bullshit but they've turned my grandmother against medication and so I can't get back on it out of respect for her and not wanting to be homeless until I go to university and live on campus. so.)) 

Now that I've been off my medication since early October, late Novemeber, I've just gotten more and more dissociative and hallucinate more and more frequently. I'm worried they're going to increase in severity too. It's easy for me to tell whats hallucinated and whats not, like I don't confuse reality at all, not even for a minute, but today while I was in Mars waiting to talk to my hiring manager about a job I knew I was getting, I hallucinated like, a full on shadow. Like the sun had come out and was shining through the door behind me and it cast a shadow on the right side of some imaginary line and then it faded once I actually like, stared at it for a few seconds. The sun did not come out but thats exactly what it was like. Not bright sun, but just like the clouds went away. But I looked and theres no way that happened, and I could just tell, that it like. It wasn't real. 

I'm worried that maybe this isn't just hallucinating from anxiety and that I might have some more severe thing that's just now coming on or something. It just keeps on getting worse and more frequent, and I don't know anybody else in real life or online that has such constant psychosis from anxiety. I was traumatized a lot when I was younger and throught life, sexual abuse, manipulation, gaslighting, verbal abuse, all that. I just want to know if anyone else is experiencing this and has been told it's from severe anxiety/ptsd, or if I should be worried and get a second opinion on my diagnosis.",21Jan2020,1
234,"After 10 months of working my ass off, last Friday I decided to leave my job at FedEx Ground as a package handler. Since March 4, 2019, I never called off or showed up late. I took a few PTO days once every few months and took a Vacation in the middle of peak season to see my sister in Vegas, They liked me so much they let me do that. But I have not been happy for a long time, the day before I quit was the tipping point because I got sent home early.  I'm heartbroken because it took a lot out of me to make this decision, but I think it's the best thing for me to do right now. When I start having thoughts in my head such as ""Man I hope I get injured on the job"" or ""I hope this Uber crashes so I don't have to go into work today.'' I think that means its time to step away. I am having regrets about making this decision but at the same time, I am sick and tired of this job. I feel like I am being mistreated, why would they keep me on the clock during break time when they're cutting hours? I worked in the Unload Section during the late afternoons and evenings (Normal days). I worked my way up and learned how to use a pallet jack. Some days I had a radio to call off trucks that were empty. I became full-time last June and was an employee of the month in June. I hated this job from day one, the first week was hell I remember having a panic attack on my second day there. But after that day I stuck with it, they moved me to the lighter boxes. I had a guy that worked there that always looked out for me before he got a promotion. The work became easy and easier it was hard being in those hot trucks during the summer in a 90-degree warehouse but I stuck with it. I saw so many people come and go. A lot of people bitched and complained about the pay but I never cared. In late August  I got moved back to working with all the heavy boxes over 70 pounds we call those IC’s. My buddy who uses the pallet jack to take pallets full of boxes of furniture or mattress got fired. He was the Fourth pallet jack guy to quit or get fired or promoted. The Managers tried to get me to use the pallet jack but all I wanted to do was Unload these heavy boxes. After a while I was like screw it, I’m going to have to learn how to pallet jack if I want to move up. Now I have mastered it. I have had to deal with a lot of workplace drama but all my co-workers that are full time like me love me like family. I feel like I have let them down, I really did not want to quit but I had to for my own mental sanity. The section I worked in, changed managers all the time after July. Some were better than others some would not let me do my job, some of them won't give me any help. The current manager takes advantage of my hard work and dedication to the company. This guy yells and doesn't let me take a break when I should be off the clock. Even though they have been cutting my hours after Christmas because they want to save money. He also makes me stop with what I am doing and moves me into a different section and when I come back to my usual place it's a fucking mess. (New Year's Eve was a blast \*sarcasm\*)  It's been a few days now since I got kicked out of work last Thursday after making a stupid decision to try to unjam a truck door with a pallet jack I wasn't thinking I should have waited for maintenance but I did not. After having a mental breakdown once I got home. I decided to not come to work the next day. I have not been back since I feel weak, I feel like I have let people down. There is so much more to my story, I did not take this job for granted even though I hated it. I spent 8 months unemployed and this was my first gig after dropping out of college. School is a whole different story. I am scared because I don't know when the next opportunity is going to come. I have applied to a dozen similar jobs. A temp agency is helping me find a new job now. But I am just anxious. I want to start working again but I think I need therapy but I am scared to ask for help.

I have been officially diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, but also Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Apparently worrying about everything 24/7 is not normal. Who knew. Anyways, they also upped my dosage of citalopram and started me on aripiprazole. I am currently on their cancellation list, as their next opening was after I leave the country for my international exchange. 

Either way, the sense of relief I felt today after finally, FINALLY getting answers for the awful mental health I've been experiencing has been worth every difficult step along the way. I am hopeful that the new medication combination will help me out, as my first year on citalopram decreased the number of mental breakdowns I had significantly. If you are in the process of seeking help, don't give up just yet! It took a year of trying to finally get in to see a psychiatrist but I know that this will be a huge help for me.",21Jan2020,1
237,"((sorry about my name i made this account without expecting someone to see it)) i’m a 16 year old boy. i’ve been extremely mixed up and feeling like my actions are out of my control or even my own thought process. if i’m being quite honest it feels like i don’t think. there’s a lot of other things that have been getting me down and my trouble is that i can’t remember any of it. my “memory” at this point feels like a cloud of static that only holds thought for a couple seconds then it just drifts away. i’ve been thinking about dissociative disorder cause i don’t feel me as a presence, i feel like a pair of eyes and ears. i’ve kinda lost the ability to laugh, or find things funny really and if i do there’s no laugh noise it’s fuckin with me. OCD has been big on my mind, i think i’ve always had it but at a young age i never acknowledged behaviors as something other than basic human functions. man lemme just spit out some shit that goes on with me/ random involuntary spasms and twitches(small magnitudes)/ recently an unkempt flurry of emotions from varying sources but primarily stress about my job caused me to punch a wall and fracture my hand(or something i don’t have insurance so no professional evaluation or surgery). part of that is that i bottle up A LOT. like this boy doesn’t want to be a nuisance in anyway i want to help and not throw my emotions at people, but lately it’s more just been an i guess unconditional fear of speaking my emotions/ “intrusive thoughts” whatever part of my inner self i’m still in touch with will berate me any chance it gets. i have a lot of random thoughts about being killed, or delusions(in general) that the person kind of walking in my direction not making any eye contact holding a bag of groceries is about to murder me/probably having some generalized anxiety, feels a good bit like what it sounds like but social anxiety specifically is more probably more present. i’m almost never comfortable around people and (regardless of who’s around) constantly feeling like somethings wrong like i’m doing something wrong. although i follow the mindset of not caring what others think and try to keep in mind that their thoughts don’t affect me, anxiety remains a strong force in my life. it cuts through me it really comes with a lot of pain and backlash from myself. the anxious feeling causes my spasms to increase, i’ll avoid the pain of talking and looking at people.//. BASICALLY i can’t isolate one disorder, illness or straight up delusion. my life really just consists of confusion, pain and numb disconnection and it’s pushing me a bit. i feel like i lost who i am, like there was this person who was a little goofy but pretty great i miss the guy man. forgot i’m wrapping this up, i don’t have the resources to get an official evaluation. if anyone who read through the entirety of this(absolutely fucking thank you by the way you’re pretty great to be using your valuable time to read through my thoughts i appreciate and love you very much even if you just get a kick out reading peoples pleads for help) has anything to offer me i will take it i have no reservations for what that may be i don’t even know what i need or what to do what i should do i’m pretty lost lol. that being said an accurate trusted online mental health evaluation is probably a good place to start. maybe some meditation advice, methods that could assist me(i’ve practiced low level sensory deprivation meditation in the past, is that something i should go back to?). i don’t know what else i should or shouldn’t put here but i’ll try to remember to check back here. i’m sorry if it seems like i’m unthankful for your time i really am but i can’t think of many more words. ah fuck i’m just gonna post i’m sorry.

238,"Ever since I got a boyfriend I feel like my PTSD (from an abusive relationship) has been compounding on my depression and I’ve been having a really hard time. I try to talk to my boyfriend about it but I end up feeling worse because I feel like a burden and even though he says nice and supportive things it also feels like he doesn’t really want to spend time with me or talk to me about it but idk if that’s just me imagining it through how sad I am. I feel really lonely in my relationship and I’m scared he’s going to think I’m so needy because of how much I wanna see him to get through with how sad I am. I don’t know what to do except keep going to sleep to try and sleep off the depression, and trying to feel better to just push through the day.",21Jan2020,1
239,Everyday I go throw times where all I can is the positive in everything no matter what I tell my self. Other times all I can see is the negitive no matter what I tell myself.

241,"I'm 19, living with my mom. For the last few months, my life has changed a lot. I don't know exactly what's wrong or if there even is something wrong. I feel really lost in life. I don't have any passions or hobbies other than playing videogames and hanging out with friends. I've also been smoking weed on a daily basis (they don't know ofc) and I know it is part of the issue but I've experienced withdrawal effects when trying to stop so at the moment I'm trying to reduce the frequency at which I smoke.

I've had some pretty noticeable mood swings in the past months too. Sometimes I feel really confident like I'm the best me I've ever been and I become very productive but in the end, I always end up not finishing anything. Other times I just skip school because I don't even see the point of getting up to do something I don't enjoy to get a job I don't enjoy and live my life unhappy. 

I also feel really insecure about certain things like my weight, height, my accent (I'm an immigrant) and trivial stuff to some like reading to the class or getting a bad grade are enough to put me on a shitty mood for the rest of the day.

I can't seem to find motivation and I have really bad procrastination issues (for school, any daily tasks my mom asks me to do or even something I decided to do by myself)

As a consequence of all of that, although my grades are still average, they are a lot worse than what they used to be before.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's the problem: My parents are divorced and I live with my mom. My mom is the type of person to tell me to endure my problems and they will eventually go away. I also seem very tired most of the time when I see her after school so she might mistake my ""mental problems"" for fatigue. 

Now my dad doesn't believe in mental illness and thinks depression, anxiety and such don't exist. He's the one I'm closest to him and I only rant about stuff to him but for some reason, he always tries to make me feel like I'm not right whenever I do it. Sometimes I just want him to say something like: ""I understand. If you wanna talk I'm here"" instead.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea how to tell them because I'm 100% sure they will both say it's just something temporary that will go away or they will just look the other way and hope for my problems to go away.

I've considered talking about it to one of my teachers but I'm too scared she won't believe me because I really don't look like I would have these kinds of problems. I also can't talk about it to my friends because we used to make fun of it (and I regret it now) and it's just too hypocritical and my pride couldn't take it. 

There's a lot of stuff that I didn't write simply because I don't know how to put it into words or insert it in this post. If you have any tips or questions for me I would really appreciate it.",21Jan2020,1
242,"I’m in my mid 20s and starting to realize more and more how short life is and it makes me sad seeing my grandparents and my mom and dad getting older. I used to be so ambitious and wanted to be a filmmaker more than anything until I graduated college and realized how hard that is to accomplish. All through college I thought I was too busy to work on my film career and now I’d give anything to have those easy days back. It’s been so hard. Took me a year to get a job and it’s 2 hours away through DC traffic. I struggled with depression in high school and college and tried therapy but it didn’t really help. Instead, I learned healthy coping mechanisms on my own and got pretty good at talking myself out of a depressive episode.

However, with all these sad realizations about life, I feel like my mental health is starting to decline again and I’m struggling to keep myself happy. I’m open to therapy but I’m worried it won’t work and they’ll just put on medication. Not that I’m against medication, but I’m worried it’s going to change my personality in addition to helping my depression. I tried antidepressants before and it made me feel plain. I felt like Spongebob when he was “Normal” in that one episode. I don’t want to feel like that again. I love my neurotic and wild personality. Sometimes I use my mental illness to my advantage when I create art or write. I don’t want antidepressants to ruin that for me. What do any of you think? Will antidepressants kill my personality or will it be worth it? It’s hard because I feel like my options are: do I want to be happy or do I want to have a unique personality? I also feel like a lot of successful filmmakers and artists in general suffer from mental health problems that helped shape their career.",21Jan2020,1
243,"When I drink I wanna kill myself. My true feelings come out cos I’m not running from them anymore. I drink frequently to escape my thoughts. I want to kill myself but I couldn’t put my parents through the pain. But I’m in pain. I’ve had therapy 4 times. 

I’m scared for my pain to outweigh my love for my parents. I’m scared to die but I want it. I’m confused and hurt. 

Who would love someone like this? No one. It’s about to be my 30th birthday and I’ve never felt so alone. I fake I’m happy to everyone around me.",21Jan2020,1
244,"I was legit just waiting for the bus (had my bus pass in hand!) and a police cruiser came around the corner and pulled in to where the buses stop. I got SO paranoid (I did tell my PO about the contact I had yesterday with a cop even though it wasn't a bad thing) that I was waiting for him to come out of his car and tell me to put my hands on the building behind me...I KNEW I was not doing a DAMN thing illegal. Then another police car went by, but he went straight up the street, not stopping and not paying a bit of attention to me at all. The cop that was stopped in the bus lane was doing something and was on the phone, further fueling my paranoia. Fuck my life. I got on the bus with no problem. Noone stopped me. Noone even cared (well, the bus driver had some sympathy for me when he saw how cold I was from standing out there for a while).  


My friend, Dante, who is also a convicted arsonist (from WAY back in the day--I am a late bloomer) warned me that I would be paranoid for a while (he still is to this day and he is my age and his incident had been way back when he was little more than a kid) and that if there are any suspicious fires in my area that the police will be knocking on my door...wonderful.

I am listening to the local police scanner frequency on-line and there was just a dumpster fire, but it was in the next  borough over and not in the city. Still, that was my MO...waiting to see if I am contacted. So far nothing.  


This is my life guys. Take it from me...  


DO NOT COMMIT A CRIME. It will fuck you over financially (I don't even know what my fines are going to be but I suspect it will be a nice small fortune), socially (people know what I am and what I did, but thankfully they are more sympathetic because in the media I was portrayed as just a mentally ill individual who didn't have her meds), emotionally (I am paranoid and worried that my PO will take me back to the prison, though I am getting everything I had to do done), and even physically (I ache all the time and I haven't been sleeping)...  


Just (DON'T!) DO IT!  


That is all.",21Jan2020,1
