3,"I've spent the last 7 years on-and-off temp work. 2014-present is the longest term I've been unemployed. Being on welfare is torture and kills my mental health even more - They treat you like an uneducated criminal. I have stopped receiving money from the gov because of this torture and because it feels embarrassing and shameful.

""Sorry, we've run out of work for you to do,"" is the reason for letting me go. But my thinking is that something is wrong with me - Like somehow my presence makes people feel sick or painful.

I have skills and talents. I don't think I do anything bad. I do the work and am nice to people where I can be.

I'm on the verge of telling people I'm going to kill myself if I can't afford to live.",16Jul2017,2
4,"If talk of suicide, delusions, or childhood sexual abuse upsets you, I would stay away from this post.

Hello. I came down with schizoaffective disorder when I was 29, 2 years ago in April. I guess I just want to share my story. I just joined Reddit and found this subreddit, so I don't know if this is unusual, but I so rarely get to talk about this life-changing part of my existence that I just want to share? Any questions are welcome as well.

So, back in 2015, I developed paranoia for the first time! I started hearing voices that I believed were coming from my phone speaker because people were following me and trying to hack into every computer I used, and were listening to every conversation I had. I thought everything was bugged, basically. That night, I saw the lights of a ceiling fan move around like a camera, and thought there were cameras behind all the mirrors in the apartment. I heard camera flashes. At that point, I hadn't slept for 3 days. This soon led to me voluntarily institutionalizing myself, because I didn't know what else to do, and thought that this is what ""they"" wanted anyway. Maybe if I went to the hospital, they would stop torturing me?

Nope. I refused to take my meds, because I decided I was being poisoned. At one point after I released, I even thought my bird (who I love more than I love most of my family) was emitting poison from his body, because he was a robot. I thought I was a robot. A pedophile robot. I was terrified that secretly I was a pedophile, and at one point a vacuum cleaner spoke to me and told me that I love to rape children. I have never raped a child, and the idea fills me with so much disgust that I can't even communicate it to you.
 
To sum things up, I was a complete and total fucking mess. Right now, I could list all the delusions I had, but doing so would make this a much longer post than necessary.

During all this time, more than anything, I forced myself to act normal in public. I could not give anyone a reason to think I was crazy. This probably saved me from going to jail, like a lot of schizophrenic and schizoaffective people. After all, I did think people were threatening me and trying to drug and kill me literally all the time. If a person thinks that, they would have all the reason in the world to defend themselves. 
At this point, I haven't really mentioned the voices much. There were a lot of them for a long time. They were scary, and I thought they were real (still have my moments). 

Finally, after a while, I decided to take my meds. After all, at this point, ""they"" weren't leaving me alone. Maybe if I took them, they would stop torturing me.

It took awhile for those meds to work, and to find the right ones. Before they started working, I went through a lot more shit, including a suicide attempt (I was mad when I woke up because it didn't work....obvs). 
Now, I am able to have a relatively normal life, though with a lot of weight gain and fatigue, due to the meds. i am on my way to having a good career, and to my knowledge, no one can tell I'm sick. I still hear voices, but that's only when I think of them. There's a girl, and a ""Satan"" voice, which is kind of scary sometimes, but mostly not, because I don't think Satan exists anyway.

I guess I'm also curious about other schizophrenic and schizoaffective people's experiences. I don't get to have many conversations with people ""like me"", unfortunately.",16Jul2017,3
5,"I am fourteen, but I will be turning fifteen in a few months. I live in Florida, with my father and brother. I tried to kill myself a while ago, and my family has been anything but helpful since. I was sent to counselling, and I thought it was gonna help. 

The problem is, my father doesn't care whether I go or not. I've missed multiple appointments because he simply does not wish for me to go. I think he only let me go to the first couple to keep up the appearance that I was, ""better."" My counsellor recommended that I go see a psychiatrist because she thinks my depression is genetic. For example, my grandmother and aunt have tried to kill themselves on multiple occasions, and my mother did kill herself. However, my father is so against medication because he believes ""BIG PHARMA"" to be in control of everything, thus every medication is evil in his eyes.

I honestly, do not feel as if counselling alone, will be adequate enough to help me quickly enough to stop me before I may try to kill myself again. Before you tell me that I need to seek some form of emergency help, I have before. It doesn't work out, being in a children's mental stabilisation facility. I didn't and wouldn't get the help I need there because they require your parent's consent to do anything. Facilities as such, simply will not let you leave until you physically say you are fine- and thus I end up lying to leave. 

I have done research, and I am prepared to live with the burden of a medication for the rest of my life if need be. I just want to feel like a normal person. I want to know what it's like to wake up, and not want to kill myself every day. I'm simply so hopeless because my father denies me help. He doesn't view this as a medical condition, he thinks I need to get over it. 

Any advice or recommendations would be sublime. Thanks.",16Jul2017,6
6,"Hello Everyone

I've been feeling extremely weird lately. It's almost as if I have depersonalization 24/7. It's very scary and weird to deal with. I've had problems with anxiety and depression but I smoke weed frequently. I stopped although. It's been almost a three weeks since I stopped. It's almost as if my brain has a heavy fog surrounding it. I hate it. I just want to feel normal again and nothing else is wrong with me, I function normally. How do I address this and help myself?

11,"Hello. For the past year or so, I have had a about five or so anxiety attacks and times where I felt like I wanted to kill myself. 
I am in high school, and if I want go to a good college afterwards, I have to work really really hard and get as many scholarships as possible. 
That doesn't bother me. What bothers me is that my mother has this set plan for me that I don't want to follow. Slowly but surely this has caused me to just go through life carrying out the motions.
There are days where I don't really feel like I'm doing anything, but just working like clock work. 
I feel like I'm losing control and I've lost my best friend recently because of both of our arrogance. I don't want to lose myself as well. 
I'm not who I was and I'm not who I want to be. 
Any advice on how I can regain control over my mind and make me feel alive and like I have a purpose would be great. Thank you. ",16Jul2017,1

Beware the voice without a face

The one that speaks of rage and hate

And tells you what awful things to do

Do not listen, the voice is not you. 

Beware the voice that speaks in the night

When your mind plays tricks without the light

It taunts you and mocks you and makes you fear

The face you can't see and the voice you can hear

Beware the voice that laughs when you're down

The distorted voice that twists truth around 

The demons that live solely in your head

Won't be quiet until you're dead

Beware the voice that spews the lies

The one that breaks you down until you cry

In terror and misery and haunted dreams

The voice inside your head that yells and screams

Beware the voice playing tricks on you

Nothing it says is even remotely true 

Its goal is to drive you completely insane 

So don't bother playing it's twisted game

Beware the voice without a face

The one that speaks of rage and hate

It's not real, so don't believe 

And maybe someday it'll simply leave

Well I guess I'll start from the beginning I am the youngest of 4 brothers. I was born into a fairly happy family until I was about 4 I think then my dad began to abuse my mother I saw it but didn't do anything which makes me regret it what if I could have helped her? He never hit me but I remember him coming into my room and yelling and getting a gun from under my bed which I didn't know was there. He was swinging it around and yelling i will never forget that image engraved into my mind i think about it daily. Eventually me my mom and my brother moved to a very small cramped apartment and me and my brother had to share a room. I thought it was over I thought I was safe I thought I could trust at least my brother and mom but apparently not. My brother began to sexually abuse me every night for years. I didn't know much or at all about sex at the time but what he was doing to me felt wrong he was giving me hand jobs when I told him to stop he didn't and said if I didn't do the same to him he would tell mom and she would get really mad. He forced me to give him hand jobs and at least 1 blow job (i only remember one) for years(i wish I could tell someone but my mom would say im lying and im too embarresed about it.) During all of this my mom and I happened to get hit by a car and I was put into a coma for a few days and hospitalized for at least a month. My brother continued the abuse once I returned until we moved houses about 4 years ago because I have my own room but now. I feel like I don't belong I can't walk around without looking around me every few minutes glancing over my shoulder and constantly feel as if im being watched which only gets worse when around mirrors or in a dark room. I am definitely depressed but when I tried to tell my mom she said ""thats for white people think about your ancestors who survived slavery blah blah blah"" no one here is on my side and I can't trust anyone not even my friends. Nothing feels real either it feels as if im watching life happen through a screen and feel nothing even when lying I don't even hesitate and I do it often. My personality changes based on who I'm talking to and where I don't even know who the real me is all I do when alone is watch youtube or anime and sleep. My older brother is clearly the favorite even though I've been told I'm gifted my whole life and gotten awards and everything my mom still likes him better and openly dislikes me. I've stopped really trying at school but I still get mostly Bs. I don't know what to do I think i might try to join the marine corps once I'm 18 to have some purpose and to get away from home. And i already know I can't get mental help while im living here because of course thats only a white person problem and I'm not black enough according to my mom. Not to mention the fact I have to see my brothers face every fucking day it's a constant reminder that I'm weak and couldn't defend myself or my mom who doesn't even like me. I think its appropriate that he shares a name with my dad.

I don't know why I posted this I just wanted to tell someone.",16Jul2017,1

16,"Hey guys -

Bear with me here as I am not very good at describing what exactly I am feeling. 

Last week, while driving down the highway at night (about 60mph) I felt a wave come over my body that made me super uneasy. It kinda felt like a panic attack, where I didn't feel like I had total control of my body and my stomach sinks a bit. At the time, I kinda felt like I was gonna pass out, but never did. Luckily I was able to pull over and have the person I was with drive the rest of the way home. 

Same thing happened this evening going down the interstate. It happened during daylight hours as well as in the dark. It came in waves where I was able to calm down and be able to release some tension. Then it comes back and makes it super hard to focus and I have the urge to close my eyes. It doesn't feel like I am fully present and reality doesn't really feel real. It makes me so nervous when I am going so fast on busy roads. It feels like I am starting to lose consciousness but don't completely. 

I have had some anxiety on the road in the past but nothing debilitating, nothing like this. 

I don't know what to even look into at all. I just know something isn't right. Please ask me any questions or suggest other subs that may be able to help. I will be able to see a doctor soon, but I am interested if anybody can relate to this or has any idea. 

Thank you for reading. ",16Jul2017,3
17,"Is it normal to be thinking about dying/ways I can die/getting into accidents when I bored? Like right now all im doing is having some donuts and coffee and browing fb and reddit then the thoughts just jump into my mind. Now im having an internal conflict on my reasons for asking about this on reddit. Am I just bored and looking for attention in which case I'm a piece of sh*t for doing that? Do I legit have a problem? Or is this just normal? Im just really confused. I've had these conversations with myself for what I estimate to be around 5yrs? Maybe even longer without realizing. Idk. I'm just tired about talking about this to people I know. Either they misunderstand me(which i totally get cuz i dont understand myself either) or they get tired cuz I get these thoughts randomly through out the day. And the internal argument just cycles into Am I a horrible person?(I keep finding reasons to believe I am) Or am I just being overly sensitive? I know it sounds vague. Sorry about that. I've had talks with the college guidance counsilor in the past. She said I was normal, had a good heart etc and should try to think of the positives. Thing is I have been trying, I have multiple distractions through video games and internet browsing. they help but I still get moments like this. I estimate maybe 3 times a. Week at least. Maybe more on other weeks. Happens more often when Im alone. But Im not very fond of being around people in general for extended periods of time. I've also been living by the saying ""Everyone has a breaking point. Everyone gets tired. It's only a matter of when. I wonder, when it's gonna be mine?"" I'm terribly afraid of dying in pain. Like legit dont want to suffer, I have never had any ""attempts"" where in any harm was done, closest I got was with my swiss army knife along my neck but i could never do it. Plus the thought of people i care about blaming themselves if something were to ever happen to me. Especially my gf who I love to death and I would never do anything that would hurt her like that. Am I a self destructive overly sensitive trying hard snowflake? Will these thoughts eventually go away? Again, I'm afraid that with time, this might get worse and start to affect the people around me. Eventually making them give up on my or worse, stay with me and suffer just cuz they care.

26,"My partner has had an eating disorder since I met her. Although she was at a point in her life where her weight had improved to a healthy level. Before thst she had been hospitalised and close to death due to not eating. Recently her family made a comment about her weight to her (there are not understanding of mental illness) and since then she has stopped eating altogether as well as started taking medication she thinks will help her lose weight. She barely eats at all and her weight has been dropping fast. I dont know what to do. I dont know how to help her. She has also recently made an attempt on her life due to her eating disorder.

I wish i could call someone to go and help her but our relationship is currently online only. We haven't met her and only talk on Skype and on the phone.

41,"Hey there. I have been thinking about this subject for a long time.

Mostly every night i fall asleep while watching some random series on my Macbook. I watch everything from Futurama, Southpark to Crimminal minds. It just has to be a series that continues, for me to fall asleep.

I have been doing this for maybe 2 years now. On average i have been sleeping without watching something maybe 1-2 times every 2 weeks, if that makes sense?

I have come to the point now where i nearly cannot fall asleep if i do not watch something, intill i fall asleep. It is only if i sleep with somebody by my side in the same bed, that i have a better chance of actually falling asleep. (I live alone). It does not really help to wake up early and go to bed early, i just keep rolling around, changing sides to sleep on.

If i do not watch something i will either not sleep for the night or i will fall asleep 3-5 hours after i went to bed.

So my question is, how do i stop this, and fall asleep normally?",16Jul2017,2
