0,Guys I didn’t come here to get judged won’t care if you do I just wanted some answers why I’m like this. So I used to be happy like any regular kid until I developed depression anxiety and adhd and tried to overdose on pills because I was bored. Instead of anything happening I just had hallucinations and thought everyone was after me.After that I took 3 tabs of lsd and something happened I think I fried my brain now I still feel different since all of this happened I’m more impulsive and try not to let my impulsive side get out. Like a side that wants to do bad things even to my family and random people I treat this side as another person inside of me and me a host for him. I constantly lie steal and used to abuse my family’s dog until I moved out I used to choke her and hit her and hoped she bit me idk why I wasn’t mad at her at all. I constantly try to analyze people because i know I’m not like most people I’m different and I act like everyone doesn’t understand things like I do because they don’t right now the only thing I can do to stop doing things like this is smoke weed and do drugs but I can’t get my hands on any right now and I feel like I might revert to my old ways anybody  got any tips on what this is?,17Dec2017,1
1,"I don't want to get into too much detail. I just need advice. I need to know where to start with medical professionals on figuring out what disorder I have and how to get properly diagnosed and helped. I'd prefer something outside of ""Call your primary physician"" because my doctors office is garbage and won't schedule me for the next few months. I live in America and I have health insurance for the time being. I'm losing my mind and my life is being affected by whatever is happening in my brain, any advice helps",17Dec2017,1
2,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this but I feel like I need to post it somewhere just to get it off my chest and see if anyone can relate because I feel so stupid and embarrassed. 

Sometimes when I get upset and I can't stop crying I'll slap and punch myself in the face, it's like it brings me back to reality and I can pull myself together and calm down.  I punched myself last night and gave myself a black eye.  Does anyone else do this? ",17Dec2017,1
3,"This is an issue im honestly too embarrassed to talk to a real person about. But it's real.
About a year ago, I got extremely high on an infused Marijuana joint (it's legal here in Washington) and went in to the theater to watch a movie. At first I was purely terrified and felt as though I might have been having a panic attack (from what Ive read about panic attacks on the internet). I decided to stay anyway, though I'd usually get out of the theater and go sit around at Taco Bell till I felt sober enough to drive. Now this wasn't a horror film, it was just an intense action flick.
Since then (and this was an entire year ago mind you) I've been completely obsessed with the personalities of the characters in that movie and actually modeled a lot of my behavior and goals after them. I graduated college and got a good job which I'm doing well at, but I'm still obsessed with the idea of them and actually saving for a car that looks a lot like one particular model from that film 'cause it's all I wanna be.
I think it's ridiculous in theory and if I'm thinking about it reasonably, but most of the time I don't. I just kind of try to imitate one of the guys from the movie. I know that if i keep this up, i will get in trouble and probably end up in prison or dead (the dude's a criminal, which i never even found appealing before this movie). The kicker here is that I'm not an impressionable kid anymore, I'm actually about to be 27.
Can anyone identify this condition and possibly suggest how to get out of that trap? 

E: oh, just so we're clear I don't smoke weed anymore.",17Dec2017,2
4,"He's turning America into China by allowing internet companies to censor us.

Isn't there some kind of free information act that was supposed to prevent this?!

He repealed an EPA rule protecting streams from coal-mining runoff. 

He doesn't give a fuck.

He also repealed an FCC ban on letting internet companies sell customers’ browser history.

He's essentially starting a spy network.

6,"I’m in a bad place. Not physically, as my home is a nice place to live in albeit its faults, but mentally and emotionally. I’m not sure what ails my mind and I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but I know for sure that this affliction is destroying me. It’s kind of hard to explain, but it’s like every waking hour is a struggle to put one foot in front of the other. I know I might sound overly dramatic, but this is what I feel. Perhaps it’s just my hormonal teenage brain making me feel this way, but it has to be more than that. I don’t think a hormonal teenage brain immediately plans out a way for me to end my life whenever I screw up, regardless of the fact that my mistake is fixable or not. I don’t think that a hormonal teenage brain refuses to be motivated towards excellence. In fact, motivation is always replaced by pessimism and defeatism.

I have seen the success of others, heard their stories and their triumphs, and learned about the willpower they have. It does not empower me when it does to others. Rather, they bring me down even further to the abyss of my mind. Rather than saying ‘If they could do that, then so could I,” my mind always thinks “I can’t do that.  I’m weak, I’m lazy, I’m useless, etc.” Rather than striving to get higher grades than my peers, I simply accept the fact that there are people who deserve the summits of the world more than I. Motivational speeches make me feel even worse. The voices that lecture me and remind me of how different I am from the others bring me lower. However, the voices of friends and family claiming that it will be better and they will always be there to support me are the worst things I have heard in my short existence of 18 years. They are wasting their time with a failure such as I. Friends should be spending more time with others rather than a morbid and socially inept waste of space such as I. My family should have already disowned me once I scared them with my first attempt on my life. My presence only hurts the hearts of my family, they may say otherwise. I’ve seen the looks of fear in the eyes of my siblings and the looks of disappointment from my parents. I’m no light to their darkness. I’m the darkness to their light. A stain on their lives that must be removed… 

To be frank, I am very weary of this struggle called living. Yes, people might say that they’ve been through worse, or that I have so much to live for. To them, I should ask “What could you possibly offer to an individual who has accepted the fact that the world is better off without them?” Love? Heh, I will only end up hurting whoever is foolish enough to pursue a relationship with me. I haven’t ended my life yet because my mother will not be able to cope with the loss of her eldest. However, once the time comes for us to part ways, I shall disappear from her life. I’m a lonely person, and if fate decrees it, I will remain lonely to the ends of the Earth.

So far, I have had a couple of breakdowns, one suicide attempt and more suicidal ideations that I can count. My friends say that I need help, but I don’t want it. Doctors should be helping others who need their expertise, not a dramatic plebeian whose ‘greatest’ asset is the cause of his plight. There is only so much one can take before they decide to simply snuff out their own light for the betterment of society.

8,I have had issues with my self esteem since I was 14.  I have had suicide ideation because of these feelings(I think of all the ways I can die). My family is concerned about the low esteem but I have never told them about suicide ideation. But then there are some days where I totally forget what feeling low is like. I can talk til I need to drink water. I also feel like I live in different dimensions but can only fully feel this one(its very hard to explain and nobody but me understands it). I want to try acid to see if I can tap into them. My family doesnt understand it when I talk about that. I also believe deeply in the paranormal (there is so much evidence that ghosts exist) and I get in arguments with skeptics because I have had experiences with ghosts and they dont believe me. I also get feelings that certain people are put in my life to spy on me(it may be true). I tried to tell my sister but she thought I was joking. I also get strong feelings that something life changing is going to happen and I need to pass it on( my sister just laughs at me when I tell her). Sometimes I get a feeling where light is way too bright or things are crooked. It causes me stress. Also some days I feel very light and others I feel very heavy and unmotivated. I also get sleep paralysis but im not scared of it anymore(I have levitated up to the celing). I am only asking this to see if you agree with my parents. They think this stuff means I should talk to someone. I dont agree. I dont talk to them about this anymore because of this.  I am questioning the motives of my family,17Dec2017,1
9,"My 4 year old began to demonstrate aggressive behaviors last month. Prior to this he was prone to tantrums when tired, hungry, etc. but he began acting out at preschool and then at home in aggressive ways. He seems to ""go away"" for a bit. He is on the attack - hitting, biting, scratching, blowing his nose on you if you're close enough, throwing things, etc. These tantrums are unpredictable, as we will say ""no"" throughout the day, and any one of these times might set him off punching me in the face. After 45 minutes - 1.5 hours, he will calm and be ""fine"". Back to the caring loving boy he is. He got kicked out of preschool (daycare) for throwing a chair and hitting someone. Since he has been home his tantrums have been getting worse and more frequent. I'm concerned this indicates a mental health issue (though I'm certainly hoping it's a phase...). Does anybody have any thoughts on the matter? My husband is a bit of a hot head and shouldering a lot of this and I'm barely keeping it together. Any help would be appreciated.",17Dec2017,0
10,"So basically I'm in high school and am 90% sure I have OCD, although since I am not officially diagnosed I don't like to say I have it for sure.

I wasn’t having a bad time either of these occasions, I just stopped being able to handle it after awhile. I’m not sure why this has been happening... I’ve noticed it at a lot of family get togethers, too. This is all new, I’ve never had this problem before...

19,"Literally all of a sudden I’m needing to see a million doctors at once and it’s so stressful and terrifying so I’m just gonna vent here.

My physical health is so shitty. I’ve had chronic migraines for ages and I’ve been having issues with my iron and with my period on top of being sick like all the time and it’s really overwhelming to not feel physically well. I know my mental health is a big cause for a lot of this because I’m not eating healthy and I’m not getting exercise. But also I’ve just realized there’s a pretty big lump under my scalp and I’ve been freaking out about that. I’m trying not to think about it too hard and just wait to hear what the doctor says but my gut tells me I’m going to have lots of testing.

Also need to go to the chiropractor.

But I also desperately need to go see a psychiatrist and psychologist and get a team back together. 


But lucky me! It’s just before Christmas and I’m trying to pay for that and college and we can’t afford to be at the doctors all the time because we never hit our deductible for 2017.

21,"I'm venting a little bit here. I'm usually a normal-ish person but sometimes I piss someone off or someone does something extremely stupid that makes me irrationally angry. Sometimes, I get vivid thoughts of violently hurting or killing assholes or faggots that ""makes"" my life miserable. It's never something swift like a gunshot, but something like a violent car crash or seeing myself stabbing someone. Note I double quoted ""makes"" because there are times where it might be my fault, but might be also just self doubting myself. I keep these thoughts to myself until now because I feel like I'm deteriorating myself or something.

Very recently, my project car (weekend car) had catastrophic engine failure and over $100 worth of tools got stolen when because it was left inside the car and the car locks were frozen and won't lock. It would be somewhat acceptable for most people, but I'm just a collage student who lives with my parents and I have no job at the time I have posted this. They support my health, but they don't support my hobby. So I'm left with a project car with a failed engine, loaner tools from friends, and another reason for my parents to not support me. After that day, I kept on having visions of hurting the person that stole my tools or letting them die if I have a choice. I realized that this isn't the thoughts of a normal human being. Not sure who I'm supposed to talk to though. I'm in the US btw.

Also, the reason I have a project car with my current financials is pretty stupid, but I'm going to keep the car for now.",17Dec2017,4
23,"Here are some of the problems that I have been dealing with. I never thought of it as being a mental health problem until this year.

1. I had a very close friend who was extremely competitive in my childhood. This turned out to be very unhealthy for me and I keep on comparing my success with others, leaving me feeling unhappy and unaccomplished all the time. 

2. I keep on procrastinating albeit unwillingly, that is, I try to get down to work and study. I procrastinate, even when I know it will harm me in the long run. I try hard but until the final hour arrives I just can't get it done. 

3. This leaves me fearing exams and I hate every hour of it, I get incapcitated. I then beat myself up by assuming that everybody else is done with their work. I get tensed even if there is a shift of a minute in my study plans thereafter and further waste time once I transgress. 

4. I can't sleep during exams and in everyday life too, I have trouble sleeping. I used to have a minor anxiety problem, since earlier this year, it has been full-blown. I can't keep it under control at all. It perhaps, came on the surface when I tried a cannabis drink earlier this year. I had a panic attack for the first time and took me 3 months to recover. I have minor panic attacks since but it has gotten comparatively better. 

6. I had to do my schooling from home for the final 3 years due to this sleep problem. In retrospect, it became a problem during the most competitive standard of 10th class I was in and the exams made it worse. Thus, for a good part of the early life, I was extremely lonely. I made up for it by playing video games all the time and my parents almost gave up on me, until I managed to turn it around a bit by getting into a college and a law college subsequently. 

Childhood was not good but not entirely bad either, lost my mother to cancer in 2014 but haven't really analysed its impact on me. I had a breakdown once while being drunk, but I have quit alcohol since. 

6. Added to this, I am socially awkward and have been trying /r/nofap for years with limited success. I make it to two-three weeks and then go on a spiral down. I picked it up in my lonely years and have been struggling since. I fail harder during exams and it leaves me with more brain fog. 

7. I have this huge urge to just leave everything and go away for a while. At the same time, I feel like it is escapism and I don't have the courage to just give up the semester and go somewhere, a part of me won't be satisfied either if I did that. I don't even have the courage to skip the exam or face failure without worrying. I get into this cycle of what ifs and it ends with me taking up my book again, followed by panic every few hours. I am 23 years old, male, by the way. I am currently in a law school. I love law and I know I am good at it too. But it has been a horror show in terms of grades. 

8. I am not sure what to do really, I want this cycle to stop, I want to wake up on time, get things done on time. I have never failed an exam but this time, I just might. Its hard to swallow, its weird too as I have studied more than usual this semester. Worst of it is, as soon as the moment of extreme crisis end, I get dormant again. Help!

9. Lastly, I have an exam tomorrow and have done limited preparation with no willingness to give the exam, have another 2 days after and don't feel like givng it either.

24,"Long story short, my niece was previously suicidal. Started cutting over the summer. Has come to live with me since October. Found out she is still doing it. Took her to psychiatric institute yesterday and they did not feel it was necessary to admit her. She will begin intensive outpatient therapy this week. When we returned home I asked her to turn over her blades and she refused. I have searched high and low to find them. My initial reaction to her saying no was that I would remove all the doors in the house. Her response was that doing that would only want to make her do it more. I am torn and don’t feel like I should have to be negotiating her safety or the safety of my younger daughter. I’m at the point that it’s either hand them over or either the doors come off of she doesn’t get to see boyfriend...

I've been on different kinds of medication now for around two years and I'm currently on 15 mg of Mirtazapine for my depression that I take every night and three 40 mg Propranolol a day for my anxiety. they don't seem to be doing anything and I'm absolutely at the breaking point. I don't want to feel like this anymore. I'm 20 and I still live at home, have no job, have no good qualifications, am too anxious to ever go to college and have absolutely no decent hobbies or skills. I don't enjoy anything anymore. for a long time I didn't want to die but wasn't opposed to the idea of death. now I really want to die and the suicidal thoughts are coming more and more frequently. I'm considering voluntary hospitalisation but I don't know how to go about it and (surprise) I'm too anxious to phone up and ask about it. I feel incredibly lonely, I have good friends but I feel like such a fucking burden on them and all I ever seem to talk about is how sad I am. I have a good family but I think they're getting fed up of me. I stayed with my ex boyfriend despite not even loving him and him being a cunt because I was terrified of being alone. I'm so fed up and exhausted and I'm just desperate to feel stable. the last time I went to my doctor I confessed that I wanted to die and cried and he said a good sleep might make me feel better and gave me sleeping tablets. I feel so defeated and like no one is taking me seriously, I've tried everything everyone recommends but I'm getting nowhere and it feels like the only thing left is to just die. I don't know how any of you could help me or if anyone will ever read this, and posting is here is absolutely last resort and I'm so embarrassed but I'm terrified and so drained and I just desperately want to feel like I'm myself again.

update: I called NHS 24 and told them I was suicidal and a member of the crisis team will be in contact with me within the hour to discuss how I feel a bit more and see what the best course of action is. imagine they told me sleeping tablets might help lol. :)))))

Whenever I'm having a conversation, in my mind there are dialogue options, like in a video game. I think about what I should say when and sometimes someone says something and I really don't know what to say except, ""okay"" or something awkward. I don't know whether this is my anxiety? I don't feel anxious when it happens. My mind just goes blank and I'm pressing a button that won't do anything.

I like to read horrible stories about murder, abuse, suicide, and things like that and then after I read them I play them back in my head only I put myself in the story and I go around inside the stories and fix everything and save everyone.  At first I thought that because I am helpful inside the story I had nothing to worry about, but then it hit me, is the fact that I think about it rather then pushing it back into the back of my mind a bad thing?

32,"I have issues or I'm mentally crazy, or some other problems.

I lack positive emotions. The feelings I feel the most are sadness, loneness, fear, disgust, and most of them are negative. There are even times when I feel that the negative emotions feel fake and something that I'm just making the emotion because I want to be normal. I can laugh and I do laugh, but when I laugh I always question myself 'Is this funny' , 'Why am i laughing' , and when I laugh, I just laugh but it feels like I'm just laughing but not feeling the funny feeling or none at all.
I lack empathy, and I can't sympathize, I sometimes don't know what I'm thinking or feeling about. When people ask me how I feel when I don’t feel anything, I just say a bland emotion, like just happy, sad, mad, or just okay. But I do feel disgust about the world, and every time I think about the future, and myself whenever I see a precognition. I feel disgust about the future whenever I daydream about a family or giving birth, or aging, because it feels like i'm molding into something and shaping into a creature. Loneness is what I feel when there are people around me and talk about the fake me. I don't show my real personality because I fear that they would reject me and hate me, and that's how I feel about myself too. I fear that they would hate my crazy self. I have emotional outbreaks quite a lot too. For like when my mother says something little upsetting about me, or just random times when I'm calm or somewhat in a good mood. Another thing is that a couple of days ago there was a dead bird, a rotting bird that died before growing feathers, and when I saw that bird I just kept thinking, “Would it make a crunch sound when I step on it?” and I felt thrill thinking of stomping on that dead bird, imagining the rotting organs bursting, and I kinda thought of it as very amusing and fun. At happy moments, I feel far away and I just keep questioning “Am I really happy? Is this realling making me happy?”, then I start feeling disgust and I feel like I’m not me. When I see the mirror, I kinda always feel the reflection I see in the mirror isn't me and I feel that I’m seeing someone else in the reflection, concluding to feel that myself in the mirror is far away. When I was little, like in elementary, I used to put pressure on my body and swept my body like when something is sticking onto your body. I really felt like something was sticking onto me and pulling or hanging onto me. It was kinda serious then, but it has calmed down, and I have them a few times a year. When I feel bored I imagine things that to me are very ammusing and funny to imagine that are not so good to others. Like I imagine beheading people, crushing people, making people very hurt with emotions(I find this the most ammusing), but I don't do this at school, because I have to keep up with the type of character that is quiet, intellegent, nice, and perfect.

I can't think of anymore things at the top of my head so I'm leaving with this, but I can ask questions if you have any.

33,"First, before anyone starts stereotyping, I'm a queer male. I fell in love with a guy several years ago and he did things to invade my psyche in very abnormal ways via pictures on Facebook and the internet at large. Whether it's trauma, obsession, some ""spell"" he cast over me, or all of the above, you be the judge, but bottom line: I need an antidote or band-aid, fast. 

I've been to many psychologists/psychiatrists over the years and have taken many antidepressants and antipsychotics. They've done little to help and sometimes have made things worse. 

Here's the sequence of pictures he used on me and the events that tie into them:

-I put up a quote on my Facebook wall: ""An intellectual is someone whose mind watches itself."" He puts up a profile pic of himself Photoshopped as a Conehead (a la Saturday Night Live), with his eyes slanted to the side, making it look like he's ""watching himself.""
He also lists himself as being in the college LGBT club but contradicts himself by listing it as ""dead to me."" 

-I get many doubts about what he is trying to say and the Conehead's quasi-phallic imagery combined with his apparent mirroring is hypnotic to me. Eventually, I write a long message to him and say at the end that I love him. He doesn't reciprocate, neither confirming nor denying if he loves me, and says I need help.

-I begin experiencing bizarre symptoms, namely like my identity is fracturing and that I'm starting to see aspects of him in the person I see in the mirror.

-In the summer, he splits his profile into two - one for his old college, one for his new college, and puts up a profile picture of himself for the new college: another Photoshopped image of himself with a third eye on his forehead, mirroring the name of a blog I created. He doesn't respond to my messages while I feel like I'm being hypnotized by the image.

-Next fall, he finally writes back to me on AIM in red text, then writes an email saying that he still thinks I need help and that I should see a campus psychologist. Overwhelmed by depression and the insanity that's filling my mind, I disenroll from college. He then puts up another Photoshopped picture, this time of himself with his face combined with mine. It's never explicitly stated, but obvious due to certain features (e.g. acne, hair, eye color). He also lists his relationship status as ""married to himself,"" which causes many psychological problems at an unconscious level (thinking I'm him, that he's me, that he's inside of me, etc.) and eventually becomes a conscious problem.

-I block him on AIM, then find out he's in a relationship with a girl who sort of/vaguely looks like me (if I was a girl, it'd be more obvious) and who shares a few major interests I had. Baited by the apparent triangulation, I get angry and write him messages which he doesn't respond to. However, he changes his profile pic to himself with a caterpillar coming out of his nose, as if to say *I* was some kind of parasite inside *him*, which infects my imagination/self-conception even more. 

-Eventually, he changes the pic to himself riding a giant butterfly in the sky (he previously referred to himself as a spider, so the connection was obvious). I still feel psychologically tied to him and that I'm being controlled, so I beg him to take the picture down. He doesn't, so I threaten him. When I do, he changes his pic to himself with two heads glaring down toward the camera in a pitch-black background.

-I block him and don't talk to him for several years, during which time I try to recover. He still manages to get inside my thoughts plenty and I suffer. Finally, I decide to look him up and find a new picture of him on a media site holding a closeup of what looks like a rabbit in his hands. Rabbit is the meaning of my last name, so I naively think that this time, he's actually in love with me. I write him a long message while on the verge of suicide, apologizing and again implying my love to him. Shortly thereafter, I look up the pic again and find he's zoomed out on it to reveal he's not holding a rabbit, but a baby pig, with him half-smiling half-grinning in the pitch-darkness while wearing blue jeans and a blue t-shirt with a triangle on it (what I interpret as a love triangle symbol; blue is an attractive color to me). He manipulated the camera angle very specifically to make the nose/upper face look like a rabbit's. He then posts the pic on his girlfriend's blog as an April Fool's ""joke"" and on a separate site. 

-I told him immediately afterward that I didn't love him anymore and that we were done (something I should have done a long time ago). However, his trick gradually caused a form of psychological paralysis and trauma. The pic would seep into my thoughts when I closed my eyes because of the darkness factor of the pic, and his smile would repeatedly appear in my thoughts. Part of this was exacerbated by me looking up the pic to see if he deleted it (he didn't). It was also because he married his girlfriend, which ""binded"" the apparent love triangle symbol in my mind. I've also imagined myself as a Conehead many times. He hasn't responded to any of my messages or pleas either.

I'm at a loss for what to do other than finding new pictures to take me out of the trauma/
obsession/spell. I can't think about what I want to think about without him entering into my thoughts somehow. I've run away from home several times, thinking I would just die somewhere. I've been to 5 mental hospitals over the past 5+ years. I even had a sort-of one night stand with a guy at one of those hospitals, but he seemed to want to move on with his life and I never found him online because he was private like that. Overall, it didn't really help. I'm trying to go back to college, but if I can't even concentrate properly and am never at peace, what's the point?

I'm begging someone, anyone, please help me by supplying a new source of images to combat the psychological grip this parasite has over me. Mirror his original images if you have to - take a pic of yourself holding a pig and/or rabbit in the dark while smiling and wearing a blue shirt + blue jeans, Photoshop yourself wearing a broken Cone on your head while mirroring his ""watching himself"" expression, put on a third eye on your forehead in a goofy way, whatever. Anything to put a positive spin on the original images and take me out of the trance. 

I keep telling my therapists this would be a valid form of cognitive-behavioral therapy because it entails ""replacement"" or ""substitution,"" but they're skeptical. I really don't have any better ideas though. So, if you have any other better ideas, let me know. I'd ask a friend to do this, but I don't have anyone close enough who would do so. 

As bizarre or ""funny"" some of this may sound, it's not a joke in the least. It's psychosexual manipulation at the soul level and it's been killing me. Please, help. Otherwise, I fear I have no choice but to confront the perpetrator after all these years and force him to confess to what he did.",17Dec2017,2
34,"I have symptoms/reasons to believe I have depression, BDD, social anxiety, a whole bundle of issues around sex/sex phobia, and emotional/self-worth issues from toxic relationships from my childhood up until about a year ago. I'm in my 30s.

It all seems like too much. Like I'm looking for ""excuses"" for my behavior/feelings. Or sometimes it seems like one thing has to be the cause of all the rest. Like, I'm only depressed and anxious and sex-phobic because of how disgusting I feel from the BDD. And then I think, no, I only feel ugly and anxious and worthless because I'm depressed. 

I sometimes feel like one of these things must be the lynch pin, but then other times I think it's *none* of them because who has that many problems, anyway? It's probably one bigger thing that I can't even see, like a personality disorder or a victim complex or some kind of mental health hypochondria. Because you know what they say, when you're really crazy you don't know you are.

There was a big shift in my life about a year ago when I started really searching through the muck that has been the last 20 years of self-isolation and resignation to just feeling sh!tty all the time. But in that year I've been identifying so many issues and seeing so many past experiences with new eyes that I feel like this is never going to end. I'm never going to stop finding new things that are wrong with me and old wrongs that have been done to me that I didn't realize at the time. I just feel sometimes like I'm making it all up, searching for problems or labels. 

Does anyone else feel this way? Or does it sound like there's something else going on I don't see? Any thoughts or advice appreciated!",17Dec2017,4
36,"I've been having suicidal episodes since I was 8-10 years old. They went away until my early 20's and then came back for a while. For a few years they went away again. In 2015 I was suicidal every day for just over a year. I have diagnosis of severe depression anxiety, migraines and not officially diagnosed but had a lot of trauma.

In 2016 I was on the verge of ending my life  and decided to call the crisis team (UK) as a last ditch effort before committing. They saved my life and saw me at home for 2 weeks and got me a consult with a prof psychiatrist who put me on the right meds. I also had 14 weeks of talk therapy. At the end of the talk therapy I was referred to another more long-term therapy (a year).

This is where it all went wrong. The assessor for the long term therapy was cold and mean, said my suicidal ideation was a fantasy. Ultimately decided I couldn't have treatment because my risk of suicide was too high for therapy (can you see the contradiction, thought it was a fantasy but now the reality means I can't have treatment) Offered me no alternative and sent me out of the office during a PTSD flashback crying my eyes out and hyperventilating into the reception area.

I finally got accepted for Trauma focused therapy with a different service because my GP referred me, it's with the same hospital that runs the crisis team.

I used to call the crisis team when I felt suicidal and that is part of my care plan and they have been amazing at talking me down and helping me feel better.

The problem that I have now is that I'm on a waiting list for the new therapy to start, and I'm scared to phone the crisis team and tell them I'm suicidal in case they say I can't have treatment any more because of what happened at the other assessment. 

I'm scared to tell anyone I'm feeling suicidal and I've started getting into advanced planning again the past week or so. I think it's because of being rejected treatment before because they said it my risk of suicide was too high. 

Usually I would phone the crisis team now but I don't want them to say that I can't have the treatment I've been waiting over a year for if I tell them how I feel.

Because of what happened at that assessment it's programmed me to think that if I tell people I'm suicidal (which is shameful and hard anyway) I will be rejected/abandoned and refused treatment so I don't know what to do.",17Dec2017,2

41,"I recently came back from nearly a month-long backpacking trip. My parents had bought a house a few months prior and moved in exactly a day before I left. I've only visited the house once prior and I didn't move in with them immediately because I still had stuff to pack at the old place, which we are awaiting closing on. I was literally still packing my stuff the day I flew out and it probably didn't hit me then because I had such an adrenaline rush from packing for two occasions, I was overwhelmed. When I got back the other day, I went straight to the new house with boxes of stuff and a completely different atmosphere. I stayed at so many homes and hostels in so many cities during my trip that I thought it would help me adapt to being in a new environment and a new home but I'm not happy there at all. 

I went back to my old home to get some more things today and I really broke down from the emotional attachment I have to it after seeing how empty it was—almost like my entire life of memories wiped out. I've lived there almost all my life and it's the only home I know. My family seems to love life in the new home but I feel so depressed living there and I don't want to ruin their happiness. It feels so secluded from everything and i guess I'm more used to living in a more urban setting with a convenient subway system nearby and a tight-knit community. I quit my FT job a few months back and I wanted to use this time to travel for extended periods of time before I got back into the workforce, but it seems now that if I want to move out soon, I will have to find something very soon. My parents know that I won't be staying in the long run because I have an independent lifestyle, but I just don't know how to cope with living in such a foreign environment right now. I know it's too soon to pull the plug and say I hate it, but I really don't know how to bring myself to make the most out of it. I can't push myself to open my boxes of things...because it feels like I'm just a temporary guest.

44,"**So first of all i will write what happened a few minutes ago, then i will post my story above. So i am suffering from HOPEFULLY INTRUSIVE SUICIDAL THOUGHTS and many other weird feelings for the last 4 months.
So I was sitting on my laptop editing a video, relatively fine, the thoughts and feeling like a little in background. But felt less real.
Suddenly a thought like 'I want to do it' entered my head and I had like a panic attack not sure what it was actually. And an urge to do it. I tried to calm my self but it got more and more intense I couldn't stand still, it felt like i wanted to do it. Fuuuuck.
Now I am calmer but I have a confusion if i am suicidal or not. fuck.
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK? WAS THIS SUICIDALITY/SI? I SAID 'I DON'T WANT TO DO IT' BUT THEN I FELT LIKE AN URGE IN THE STOMACH LIKE I WANT IT.
AND I TRIED LIKE IMAGINING A POSITIVE FUTURE BUT IT CAME OUT NEGATIVELY AND LIKE NOTHING MATTERS FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK.
EDIT: An hour later i feel relatively fine again. WHAT THE FUCK WAS THIS?!?!**

So, here is my story:
Hello reddit! First of all I am 20 years old male with no history of mental illnesses, no abuse, and a normal happy life, with happy family. I don't do drugs, but I smoke and drink, or used to drink a lot of coffee, before this happened. My WEIRD MENTAL STATE? began 4 months ago.(22.07.2017 I DON'T GET IT HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN IN ONE DAY) I feel like something in my mind broke... And do you know the reason? I heard of someone(Chester From Linkin Park) who died by suicide. Since then, my life changed completely.

I don't know why. I don't know how. I don't know what to do next.

I suddenly asked myself: ""Why he did it, he had 6 kids, he had everything? What kind of force drive him to suicide? What stops me from doing it too?"" and then I experienced something strange, something confusing. I have really hard time describing what is happening in my brain(nearly impossible), but i will try. Life feels meaningless without any apparent reason. I am constantly anxious, have less energy. I don't go outside as I used to. I am constantly in my home, searching google articles about mental issues and so on. I am constantly in my head.

My interest in people dissapeared. There are other weird feelings in my head (￼As I said, I can't trully describe them.)

weird feeling: Like I am somehow disconnected from my old life?

weird feeling: Like I am in a weird unsettled life state.

weird feeling: Scary/Terrifying/Real/ Scenarious in my head like for example ""My best friend ask me if I want to work with him(We had very succesfully store.) And I answer him, no I want to die"" etc. WHAT?!

weird feeling: Like when this happens EVERYTHING SEEMS DARKER AND DOOMED, LIKE IN A HORROR MOVIE?

weird feeling: I simply cannot get out of my head when it happens, constant negative thoughts(i listed them above) weird feeling in the stomach, feeling dissociated from sveryone, everything i imagine in my head, even my home seems dark and doomed?

weird feeling: Like life is meaningless?!? Without a reason???

weird feeling: It feels like i imagine waking up everyday but it feels like i am waking every minute.

weird feeling: Feels like I won't be here soon.(generated From the scary thoughts.

weird feeling: When I try to do something I can't do for long time. Eventually there is a weird feeling associated with a throughts like the above that doesn't allow me to do it. It is strange, feels like anxiety a bit, but not exactly.

weird feeling: When I am relatively okay, there is a feeling like I am anxious, idk strange feeling in the stomach(not exactly anxiety.) Can't fully describe it.

weird feeling: Like i am dissociated with life(not like the derealization stuff) - again I am not sure what it is it feels strange.

weird feeling: Feeling like I don't want to get better.(This is the scariest one.)

weird feeling: Feeling like years have passed between my old life and now.

weird feeling: Feeling like there is no emotional content in my memories.

weird feeling: Confusion if I am suicidal or not?!?!?!

weird feeling: Feeling like a wave between now and the future happens in my head and makes me feel tired and anxious.(This happens especially in the morning, when I stand up and stop being sleepy it dissapears.)

weird feeling: When I do something it randomly appears it is like a feeling of /suicidality/hopelessness/flying feeling/ (not sure can't describe it.) and when this happens there is a strike in my stomach.

weird feeling: There are pictures stuck in my head(2 or 3) mostly regarding to future. for example: me in the garden of my university walking - like i am looking at myself from a flying drone. they seem dark or super bright in my head. weird feeling: Feeling that there is something wrong with my thinking pattern and my rational thinking.

weird feeling: Sudden feeling of being trapped(In life?). (It happens randomly.)

weird feeling: That I will suicide if I work, and since then I am not working.

weird feeling: Going out seems weird/scary/overwhelming/I don't know.

weird feeling: Something that happened a long time ago seems close, something that happened a short time ago feels far. weird feeling: This is about babies. Somewhere I have read ""I don't want kids on this terrible world."" And now there is a weird feeling when I see a baby.

weird feeling: Everything seems darker. Like my vision changed.

weird feeling: When I read here on reddit someone who is suicidal/depressed etc. All of the feelings come back and it feels like i am feeling the same way as him. (When time passes I can see the difference.)

AND THE MOST IMPORTANT :WEIRD FEELING THAT IF I WORK/GO TO UNIVERSITY OR FEEL OVERWHELMED I WILL S....... FEELING THAT I AM ALREADY OVERWHELMED AND WILL S......

Update 0: I have days, when I feel relatively normal, but still those thoughts, feeling are in background accompanied by butterflies/knot in the stomach and a weird feeling.

Update 1: Yesterday I read somewhere that you are suicidal if you have desire to die. When I read this I had (? I am not sure what i felt -???Anxiety attack??? )and the thoughts felt so real like I am feeling the same way, it lasted about an hour then I felt normal, and the thoughts seemed less real.

Update 2: Last night I was laying in my bed and decided to go to the kitchen to smoke a ciggarete. I was relatively fine. I was sleepy. As I was smoking I suddently looked in the place where we are keeping the knives and imagined getting a knife and s...... I got intense strike in the stomach and like an urge to do it, it felt real. Then I tried to calm my self but the thought ""Life is meaningless"" with somekind of weird ??future?? feeling came. The strike in the stomach became more intense, I immediately went to my room. I was no longer sleeping, and started googling about suicidal thoughts/suicidality. Today I woke up with low mood and the pictures of yesterday stuck in my head, with a weird stomach feeling. Also while I am writing this there is a feeling/thoughts that I just don't want to admit it. And a confusion if I am suicidal?

I went to a psychiatrist, and told him about the throughts. He asked me if i have a plan or fantasie about.... Then I said no, but i see intrusive images. And he said that it is ocd.

I don't have much symptoms of depression. But I do have less/none interest in the things that used to be intrerested. I go less outside. I am more irritable. I can't tell if I have anxiety because I want it or because I don't. I am afraid of the summer comming, because I read somewhere that people often do it then and now it feels so damn real. It happened in one day I don't get it. Also I went to 4 Psychiatrists and 1 Psychologist, I asked them if this is Major Depresive Disorder, they said that it is unlikely, because I have very few symptoms, They asked me if i set goals to high and so on. And none of them said that it is major depresion, very unlikely. Also, for about two weeks I was relatively fine, the thoughts were still there, but seemed less likely. Then all of a sudden after i read about a guy who was suicidal. The thoughts came back and feel realer than the real. The scary thing is that there are feelings, not only thoughts. For example: Yesterday I read somewhere that you are suicidal if you have 100% desire to die. Then I got hit by (anxiety) not sure and the thoughts seemed even more real, like i really had a desire. It lasted about an hour then I calmed and the thoughts felt less real. Today the same thing happened. Today I also had pulsating neck pain on the right side.(Maybe it is sign of anixety?!?! Maybe not?!?) What the actual f**k??

I don't wish to not being born, to not exist or to not wake up tomorrow for example. But there is a strange, unexplainable feeling that makes me think I am suicidal. WTF? Also when I read somewhere that you should ignore or not give attention to the thoughts because it may become worse, I feel even more terrified because I can't ignore the thoughts. Also the feeling that I don't want to get better makes me more terrified.

Does that sound like Active SI?

And many ??intrusive?? suicidal thoughts about 16 to be exact, I picked a lot of them while researching and now they are stuck in my head. But I will not list them because they may trigger someone. I visited 5 psychiatrists, yet, no clear diagnosis. One of them suggested Adjustment Disorder, but I don't think that this is the case, exept I moved to new city(1 year ago.)(because I study there.), and had a lot of stress during exams, nothing more.

I've Googled a lot, about mental health issues, and visited few psychiatrists, one of them Suggested Adjustment Disorder, the second one suggested OCD, but still I am so confused.:

Does this sound like Depression?

Does this sound like Bipolar?

Does this sound like Anxiety?

Does this sound like OCD?

Does this sound like BPD?

Does this sound like Existential Crisis?

Does this sound like SI/Suicidality?

Everytime i post on reddit i feel like i missed something....

Do I sound suicidal?

Thanks in advance, have a good night.

45,"Edit: I've never suffered from mental illness in my life this is the first time 

I'm 17(male) and got home from work today at around 2 in the afternoon. My mom is normal and I had a nice conversation with her. But it's my dad he is suffering from immense anxiety from work and is busy fixing things in the house. And the way my dad likes to release his anger is by yelling at the top of his lungs inside calling himself a moron, a F***king idiot, a dumb ass. He has been like this for 2 months straight and me, my brother, and sister are terrified of him. He has never hurt us he has only once grabbed me by the collar yelled at me once. But his constant cussing and self hating has been taking a toll on me and today for an hour I just sat staring at the wall then I hunched over in my chair and started repeating sentences while shaking idk what this is was and it lasted for ten minutes straight but it felt like 10 sec. I then snapped out of it and my dad came up from the basement. I confronted him and he just yelled at me for a bit he won't listen. I then went to my room and went into another trance thing. I just sat in the dark for ten minutes looking at my wall. I snapped out of that and I came here. I need help. ",17Dec2017,2
46,"Hi guys, I need to get something off my chest and I need some honest feedback. This might be a bit long, and preamble before I get to the issue. 

I've been in a long term relationship with an amazing girl, I love her to pieces. I've the past few months I've had some minor self destructive/sabotaging thoughts. They were never obvious to me, but only in retrospection.  I think I've been sabotaging because I don't feel worth it, or something.

Anyway, I was on a trip alone a while back when I had an encounter with an Asian escort . I know I shouldn't have, but I was lonely, horny, etc.I don't condone my actions, and regret them deeply, but at the time I ended getting a bj from her.  Before I realised what happened, my penis was her mouth without a condom on.

The past few weeks, I've felt fine. No adverse reactions, etc. Lady night my gf mentions her lower back is sore. This morning she mentions that her stomach is sore, below the belly button. 

I'm suddenly paranoid, now am anxious wreck.

As I said, I love her, I want to spend my life with her. I'm now worried I might have caught something.

1) What is the chances I could catch chlamydia or gonorrhoea from a bj, which lasted just a few minutes, and I don't think my head touched her throat.

2) I live in an area that has a law of your tested, by law everyone must be notified. I dint want to go that route unless 100% necessary

3) if I did give her something, I have no idea how to broach this subject. I love her, I want to grow old with her. I dint want her to hate me, lost her love for me, etc.

This is what's causing my anxiety, I'm a sudden wreck. ",17Dec2017,0
48,"My 18 year old brother has started to act strange.

 I find it hard to talk to him these days. He spaces out often and then forgets what we were even talking about. He will go off topic as well. I find it very hard to keep a conversation going with him. He sometimes seems like he isnt listening at all. He doesnt like eye contact either.

He also doesnt bathe as much. I have to remind him to bathe and eat. He doesnt seem to have a great appetite. He also has to be reminded to do a lot of simple things such as closing the fridge door.

He is also very restless at night. I can hear him walking around a lot. I can also hear him tossing and turning in his bed. I have heard him talking as well. When I ask him about this he said that he wasnt talking at all.

I also find him just staring into space without moving. I just leave him be but I find it a bit unnerving that he can do it for 2 hours at a time. I dont like it. He also laughs randomly

Sometimes he will just pause what hes doing and freeze up for a few minutes and not respond to anything(causes people to get mad). 

He has also refused to eat food because it tastes weird. I will try it and it tastes normal. He doesnt like eating out anymore either. He also doesnt even want to go outside of the house and he gets anxious whenever we go anywhere. 

He talks to things that are not there,often. It freaks me out. He doesnt know that I have seen him do this though. I have also seen him pacing in his room. He also just sits at the end of his bed just staring into space. 

He has also told me that he thinks there are cameras in his room. He has put clothes on top of the ""cameras"". There is no convincing him they arent there.  He actually doesnt change in his room because of this. He also talks to our cat(we dont have a cat) and he also believes people can read his mind so he wears a hat a lot(he believes that will block them from seeing his thoughts)

I dont know what is going on. I know that how he is behaving is not normal but I dont know how to discuss it with him. I dont know what to do. ",17Dec2017,1
