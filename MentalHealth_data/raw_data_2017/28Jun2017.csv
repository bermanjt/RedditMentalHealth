0,"This has happened on and off through out the years, but lately more so. I'll be driving home from work, taking the same road I always take home, and suddenly for a few seconds+ intense panic and fear takes over and I forget where I am, I don't recognize my surroundings and I'll think I took a wrong turn. Then a minute later, it'll come back to me. This happens with other things too. Like I'll just suddenly forget what I was just doing, just thinking, etc.

Any ideas what could cause this? Any name for it? Is it normal?

1,"Since the drugs themselves take a few weeks to take effect, I'd assume side effects would be a bit delayed too? I'm not sure. I've been on 3 different antidepressants for the last 4 months or so. I've had no issues with these. 

2 days ago, I got the dosage raised on my main antidepressant (Citalopram/celexa) and was prescribed a new one (bupropion/wellbutrin). All day today I've felt really, really down. I've got severe depersonalization going on and I've had minor head spins and nausea. Since it's only been two days, could this be from the medicine? I've read through all the info that came with it but there was nothing about how soon side effects could occur. 

Also, if it is from the meds should I be concerned or do I just need to give myself time to get used to it?

3,"“Why do we have to listen to our hearts?"" the boy asked.
""Because, wherever your heart is, that is where you will find your treasure.” – Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist

I remember a time when I was a slave to the opinions of others, I can remember the feeling of despair and uncertainty of what others thought about me. There was once a time where I was depressed, drug addicted and angry at the world. I could not understand why my life was the way it was, I believed that there were lucky people, and that I was just one of the unlucky ones. Looking at others with jealousy and hatred I compared myself to everyone around me, always checking my blooper reel against their highlight reels. Then something happened, as if a wind came past me taking these feelings of negativity, hatred, and disgust with it. I cannot be sure when this change occurred but I do know that it all came with a desire to be better, it all came when I decided that I was going to raise the standards for myself and live a better life. Suddenly I did not look at people who had more than me as enemies, and soon looked to them as mentors. When I began my journey into a higher level of consciousness, I began with a quest to find my inner calling. After fumbling around and trying many different avenues, I had finally found a calling greater than myself, my mind had finally connected with my heart. At least my mind began to listen to my heart. This finding has taken me farther than I ever thought possible, but it is my belief that we all contain this inner calling, and that somewhere along the way we lost contact with it. This may be what we describe as the feeling of having a void in our lives, but this is a voice we can all hear if we listen to it. 
All people have a calling within themselves, our hearts are always speaking to us, pleading for us to accomplish that in which we desire. When we are children we have a strong connection with our mission, we all have a strong bond with our hearts desire. Yet, as we get older we begin to lose touch with that inner voice. The everyday daftness of life begins to take hold of us, our dreams are denounced as silly or impossible by the people around us, so, as we get older our dreams and desire begin to fade away as we settle for a safe job, or a safe life. It is not that we lose our dream, it is that we silence this voice with the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves, and the world around us. What we do not see is that we are in control of these stories, and that at any time we can change our narrative about ourselves. 

Many of us live our entire lives without ever finding our treasure, without discovering the true nature of what is in our hearts. It is only when we are laying on our death bed that we begin to realize all that we wish we could have accomplished. It is because of this silencing of our true selves that we suffer. We become so attached to others that we begin to see ourselves, not as we are, but as we think other people see us. We begin to act in accordance with what the world expects from us. It is in this civil obedience that we silence the voice of our hearts calling. If we are to ever find our treasure, if we are to ever find happiness and fulfillment, we must break the minutia of the everydayness and reflect on who we have become. We must, as Carl Jung would say, become “self-actualized individuals.” 

To become a self-actualized individual, we must obtain the self-awareness to access where we are at, and we must ask ourselves the only question in life that matters; am I happy? There is a massive difference between pleasure and happiness. Pleasure is what we seek in addiction, pleasure is a momentary relief of the sufferings of desire and expectancy. Pleasure is a neurochemical cocktail served up to motivate us to repeat behaviors; many times, behaviors that are not beneficial to our well-being. Happiness is lasting, happiness is fulfillment, happiness is having a direction and a mission. We find happiness when we are in the pursuit of our hearts treasure. We find happiness from progress. What we must begin to understand is that to find this kind of happiness, it is up to us, and no one else. 

Achieving success in any area of life is only for the select few, for those that are special. So, what makes these high achieving people so special? The answer is simple, they believe that they can do it. That is what makes people successful, it is just the belief that they can achieve the goal that they set out for themselves. Believing in ourselves is not an easy goal to accomplish. Most of us move through life in the manner we have become accustomed to, enjoying mundane conversation with friends and co-workers. We become creatures of habit and accept life the way that it is. To believe that we can have more we must first want more, we must dig deep within ourselves and find what it is our hearts are calling us to do.  We must dig through false belief, social expectation and most difficult of all, we must dig through fear. Many of us never act because of fear. We fear the unknown. When traveling through life we always have many paths that we can take. Out of all the paths that we walk, we only know the outcome of just one. That is the path that we are on, the path that has been set for us by everyone else in our lives. The lack of knowledge we have about these other paths keeps us from making a change, from trying something new. We fool ourselves into believing the path that we are taking is safer than these less known paths, but this is not true. Taking the safe road and doing what has always been done is even more risky. It is riskier because regret is the worst feeling of all, and by remaining inactive and playing safe, we will all one day experience the regret of being inauthentic. 

There came a time where I recognized this truth, and although I did not know what the future would bring, I knew I had to step through my fear and make a change in direction. This day came when I decided I would go to rehab to overcome my heroin addiction. I had reached a point where I was tired of being depressed, I was tired of being a slave to a substance and I knew that there was more to life than what I was doing. Scared as hell, wondering if what I was doing would pay off. Wondering what life would be like after I made this decision, I boarded my plane to fly off to another state, far away from home to begin my journey. I knew that I could not blame other people, I knew I could not blame drugs for my behavior. I knew that I was responsible for the outcome of my life, and that if I did not make this change and take action that no one else was going to change my life for me. Many of us wait to act. We wait because we expect too much. We wait for others to fix our lives for us, we blame everything and everyone but ourselves for the way our lives have turned out. We fear taking accountability because admitting that everything is our fault means that our lives are the way they are because of the decisions that we have made.  What we are missing is that by taking accountability for ourselves, we are regaining control of our lives, and our destinies.  

Of course, we do not control everything that happens to us. Most things in our lives are outside of our control, but we do have control of what matters. We have control of the way we respond to what happens to us. In addiction, it is very common to go back to old behaviors, or even relapse. While we may not have been in the right frame of mind, or we were experiencing the difficulty of change, it is the way that we respond that is what matters. In recovery and in any change process there is too much emphasis placed on the end goal. People in recovery set the goal for themselves to be “clean and sober” and focus primarily on this daunting task, when the truth is that the goal is not what is important. There will be things along the way that will deter us from reaching this goal in the period in which we had in mind. What is important is the process. It is the process that we have control over, it is our level of effort that we have control over, it is our ability to see setbacks as learning experiences and not failures that drives us forward. 

Taking accountability for our actions and making changes in our lives is not an easy process to go through. Change comes with a litany of negatives feelings and difficult decisions. Therefore, we must be in tune with our higher selves, and with our most authentic desires. What we are looking for is our north star, the thing that gives us direction when we feel lost. Our why in life provides us with strength when we feel weak. It provides us with courage when we feel afraid. Our why causes us to think about our actions, and it causes us to reflect so that we may make the decisions that will bring us closer to our truest selves. 
We may not find out passions right away but what we can do is raise our standards. We can make the decision that we are not happy with the way things are going, and that we are going to make a change. Finding what our passion is, finding the reason we are here is something that takes time, discomfort, and constant progress. It takes being willing to fail, it takes willing to be different than the person we were just the day before. While this seems like the more difficult road to take, it is not. This is the only road worth traveling because everything in life involves risk. Everything in life involves discomfort. If you don’t risk the discomfort of being healthy today, you will face the discomfort of sickness as you get older. If you do not face the discomfort of trying something new today, you may be faced with the discomfort of regret when it is too late to do what you’ve always wanted to do.  For our lives to be full, and our voids to be filled we must move past our fears and live lives that are authentic to our hearts.

12,"I have noticed this a lot with myself: Whenever someone cries, specially when they cry out of sympathy for others, or out of pain of something major they went through, my mouth curls upward in a bit of a smile.

What is wrong with me?",28Jun2017,1
13,"For the last six months I've been hallucinating. It started with spiders, then there was a black humanoid in the bathroom closet. Then it stopped for a few weeks, but while it was gone I had lost all motivation and couldn't even convince myself to leave bed to get food. Then the hallucinations came back, and I was free from my comfy prison.

It was just colored shapes in the corner of my eye, and the hallucinations always vanish when I look at them. There were some feelings of bugs on my skin when they weren't there, but that's normal. Then I noticed the audible ones. Taps on my window at night, screams when I was using a hair dryer.

Then everything stopped. I felt great.

Until yesterday. It's back, and it was just shapes until 15 minutes ago.

I hear footsteps. I heard a girl talking in the living room, someone tried to open my door. There aren't any girls here, it's just me, my father, and my little brother. They are both asleep. So I grabbed a flashlight and a pair of scissors to go check it out.

They are both asleep still, and the footsteps and noises have stopped, I check every corner of every room and nothing. I go back into my room and lock the door just in case.

The toilet flushes. I race out of bed and into the bathroom. Nobody, everyone is still asleep.
So I go back into my room and footsteps. Footsteps right outside my door. The toilet flushes and I race back to the bathroom. Nobody, nothing.

""Alrighty, this is worse than I thought"" so I lock myself in my room and keep scissors nearby.

Galloping noises go down the hallway. I get up to check it out and once again nothing. We have dogs, but they haven't moved and are all asleep.

I'm currently laying on my bed shaking.
I've got no idea if I am crazy, or if someone is stealthily sneaking around my house.

So I decided to list my symptoms here and ask if I should get help.

So there is the above, and these few I need to add.
I've had a voice recently, it's not really a voice but thoughts that aren't mine, horrible things. Things that I'd never think. Like drowning myself to see how fun drowning is, throwing myself out the car window because it'll be fun. Generally harmful or offensive things is never even think of. Except when I realized this was happening and started ""talking"" back to the thoughts, they vanished.

18,"I am 26 and my mother has severe mental health problems. Growing up, life was great with her, my younger sister (21 now), and my father. My mother had a mild case of bipolar disorder when I was young, but I never noticed until I was 18. See, my mother's best friend committed suicide when they were in high school and I think it triggered something deep. After that, she began living through other people. She would spend all of my family's money to take us on family vacations to make us (her children) happy. She would buy all of the Christmas presents and even though she would spend WAY too much, she would cry every Christmas because she thought she hadn't bought enough. 

My father stayed with her until my sister and I were adults and just divorced her a few years ago. Now, my mother lives alone and lives vicariously through my sister, primarily because she is still at home. I went away to college and now live with my wife in Illinois while my mother lives in Michigan. My mother has a strange habit of being extremely involved in my sister's dating relationships. To the point that if she fights with her boyfriend, my mother would message him and fight for her or on her behalf. When my sister ends a relationship, my mother goes into a depression as if someone had died. 

I know this is long, but I don't know what to do. I have always been the person closest to her in her life. My mother has no friends (besides old high school friends that she converses with through social media) and she is absolutely consumed with social media outlets. She works part time in retail and spends all of her money on everyone else but herself. She doesn't take care of herself because she feels that she is constantly not enough for everyone around her. 

My mother had a breakdown because my sister ended a relationship a few days ago. My sister ended an emotionally abusive relationship with a guy and he posted some unwanted things on Twitter. Well, my mom just ""couldn't stand it"" that he was saying those things, so she messaged him about it. He then posted that his ""ex's crazy mother won't leave [him] alone"" and it destroyed her that she embarrassed herself and her daughter. She is speaking suicidally and is now attacking all of us in the family as if the whole world is against her. 

I'm so scared for my mother because there isn't a single day that I wake up and don't think my mother could be dead this morning. I don't know how to interact with her. She tells me she sees a therapist, but I have no idea if she really is or what she actually says to this ""therapist."" She has a habit of telling everyone what they want to hear and making everything seem great in person.

I know this is long, but I need help. Does anyone have any advice? Please. My wife and I are expecting our first child and I am getting really depressed trying to care for everyone. 

UPDATE:::::: After hours and hours this week speaking with my mother, she admitted that she attempted suicide the other day and it was no one's fault but her own (meaning SHE is the one who took the pills, no one forced them down her throat). We have gotten to a point where I convinced her to see her psychologist (even if it is just to ""shut [me] the fuck up about her needing 'help')"". She sees her psychologist this afternoon and so I'm trying to contact her psychologist ahead of time so he knows she attempted suicide. She said she would be admitted if the psychologist said she should. ",28Jun2017,5

20,"I tried looking for help on /r/fetish some months ago with no luck. I'm not attracted to almost all of the people I meet. I don't get physical reactions to them. I don't wanna do things to their body. I had to leave perfectly good relationships because nothing would work sexually.

It only works with people what have very specifical physical characteristics. I'm sick of having to look for those people all the time, I'm sick of having to give them embarrassing information about myself and have them say it's fine just so they'll ghost me later, I'm sick of thinking about this all the time and feel like I'm missing out on life, I'm sick of people being curious about me like I'm some sort of fucking zoo animal but not wanting or being able to help.

I tried getting help with this and some pain related issues but the clinic never called me back. By this point I'm having nervous breakdowns because of it regularly, I'm always feeling like shit, I'm wasting time looking for people and taking shots in the dark when I'm busy and I could be doing something more productive.

You know those times when everyone is supposed to be perpetually horny in their teens? I wasn't. I litteraly didn't associate any of the regular sexual stuff with arousal, I had no reactions to it, weird-ass obsessions I had since I was a toddler ended up being my sources of arousal later during that period.

21,"I'll try to say how I feel right now. I'm a Male 24 years old.

My mom throughout all my life, has me feel insecure and self conscious about myself which turned into deep resentment and disrespect towards my mother. My mom always tries to point out the flaws in me, the insecurities I already have because of her, the acne that she always points out, the skinniness, everything seems like a problem with her. She's never been the one to have a positive mindset on life, she's extremely negative and always has been. She's a habitual liar, always lies to me about things even when its serious which in turn made me not trust anyone at all especially women. Also, she doesn't really profess love like a normal parent would do, she'll only congratulate me and hug me rarely when I achieved something, I hardly ever heard I love you from her. Shes not quite the affectionate type of women but she tries and it comes off the wrong way.

 Over the years this has made me feel insecure about my self, and self worth. I've become extremely introverted and homebound because of her since the 2nd year of high school, I had terrible acne in high school and she criticized and made me feel like shit everyday and it sometimes comes off like shes making a joke/fun of me, which led to me getting anxiety and not going to school a lot because I feel like others would criticize, point out or make fun of me. 

Most of our conversations now is anger from me but not all the time, I shout at her, yell at her, I hate being around her presence for too long that it starts to annoy and bother me to a great extent. I get extremely bipolar around her now. 

This women is so bad that she made one of my sisters friend insecure about her weight that she lost it all because of my moms criticism about her. I'm not saying my mom is an evil person but she has poor social skills that makes everyone feel down and negative. It's broken me. I don't think i'll ever be a normal human being because of her. 

I don't know what I should do about my situation, should I leave and move away from her or contact a psychiatrist so they can possibly diagnose me? My self diagnosis is ASPD, Anxiety and Depression, and narcissism.

23,"I've been on meds for 10 years, I am a 23 yo male. Been on Abilify and Zoloft together for 3 years since April 2014, prior to that with a different psychiatrist was on Zyprexa/Prozac.

 I've been in the process of weaning off of both Abilify and Zoloft since April of this year, and my doctor said it was OK for it to be this fast. I saw him last Thursday morning, and later that day I noticed an itching sensation from head to toe. Taking a shower did nothing, literally the only relief I have been getting is from sleep. The intensity varies throughout the day. This morning it was actually the worst it's been since Thursday while I was in the shower. I have also noticed increased irritability and feelings of stress, but I don't know if it is a direct result of my skin feeling like it's crawling constantly.

 I wasn't able to reach my doctor until Monday of this week (2 days ago) and he suggested that I try Benadryl or some antihistamine. This immediately made no sense in my head but I figured, I have no other choice. I've been taking generic Benadryl every 6 hours since Monday and nothing has changed. My doctor told me from the beginning it would be ""unlikely"" that I experience withdrawal symptoms. He said what I am experiencing currently he has never heard of and is ""extreme"". I called him today because I'm running out of options and explained it's still the same, since he never gave me a timeline to work with, after I repeatedly asked him, and his only response to not giving me a timeline was ""It's unusual what you are describing, the only other thing I can recommend is going back on the medication or taking different allergy medication. Have you considered that what you are describing might be unrelated to the medication?""

 He says this even though I told him Monday that the same thing happened to me before, several months before I saw him in late 2013/early 2014 when I tried stopping Zyprexa/Prozac cold turkey, under no doctor's instructions but because I was very sick then. The same itching/hypersensitive skin happened both then and now, under different meds, under two different discontinuation lengths. My primary care physician isn't available until tomorrow, and he doesn't talk to patients on the phone.

 If anyone has experienced something like this or something similar before, could you please tell me what's going on? I don't know what to do, and not about to self-diagnose myself just because my psychiatrist is not being super helpful atm. Thank you.",28Jun2017,2
24,"This is the second time I've seen him. He's a Psyd. But it was disheartening. The first time, I thought maybe he just needs to know why I'm here (I wanted to stop getting in my own way, stop fearing conflict and failure) and what my childhood was like (My father was an abusive alcoholic.)  So most of that first session he just took notes. 

The second session, he basically did the same thing. Kept asking questions about what I wanted to get out of therapy. I explained the same thing over again. Wanted to get a job and move out of our current living situation. Do you have any suggestions of how to start tackling this situation, I asked? 

""Well, first I'd actually have to HAVE suggestions. It's tough."" He replies. Again, more incredibly long silence. I don't know what to say. He's not talking. Just staring at me.  He asks me some more times about my living situation. I explain it for the third time. ""I need to get out of my own way. I have motivation but no action."" 

""How would you even move your family out? You have two kids and a wife."" He asks. ""I mean... "" And then more silence. 

""that's my point. It's tough and I have problems with taking action."" I reply. 

 I don't think I'll be seeing him again. But the whole thing left a terrible taste in my mouth. I walked in there in a great mood. ""Let's get to work."" then left defeated and depressed. He didn't offer any advice and didn't offer any insight. He just asked questions and kept writing in his book. 

It sucks because it was a huge personal leap for me to seek professional guidance as I previously didn't believe in therapy whatsoever. I have to say this is confirming my previous bias. Is this how it's supposed to be? Because if that's the case, I'd be open to other suggestions for self improvement that aren't therapy.

25,"Hello people of reddit. For some reason I keep talking to myself &amp; creating situations in my head. A few random examples would be ""me answering questions in an interview"", ""in a social situation where I am the leader of the conversation"" &amp; everybody is just listening to me. 

Another would be ""made up arguments/discussions"" about different topics. I've noticed it's mainly me explaining something to someone. Regardless of the thought being negative or positive. Why do I do this? Is it just an overactive imagination? Or is it an actual diagnosis. 

I hope I just have a strong imagination which I have reasearched the ""Law of Attraction"" &amp; maybe I could use this strong imagination to dream things in to reality. I already suffer from depression/anxiety (mainly social) but even my thoughts make me anxious. 

I noticed that if I watch a video. My mind automatically comes up with different ways on how I would deal with it. Feeling as if I am actually there. 

For example a video of two people fighting. I love mma but how come when I see a street fight video I get anxious?. As if im about to fight. There are probably things that I have missed out whilst writing this so feel free to ask questions for more of an understanding.

28,"Buckle up everyone, this will be quite a story. Because I'm using a throwaway account, I'll call myself X. I am X, I am female, I am 22 years old, and this is my really dumb story of something minuscule that has been causing me anxiety since I was 15.

I'm not a person with low self esteem, actually. I actually am pretty happy with myself about 80% of the time. To me, that's a really good percentage. But the one thing I pride myself off of more than anything else --- is being ""cute."" I'm small, thin, short, and my fashion sense mimics research I've done on Japanese and Korean pastel street fashions. Wearing pastel colors, dresses and frilly skirts, I'm at my most confident.

So where does the inferiority complex come in? Simple. I'm intimidated by anyone who could possibly be described as being ""cuter"" than me. Since high school, I would avoid girls with big doe eyes, I would secretly hate girls who wore dresses that would look better on them than me, I wouldn't be friends with girls who were shorter than me. And for what? Because I needed to be the one that everyone looked at and thought ""oh, look at X! She's cute!""

So, do I actually have good self esteem? That's up to you to decide. Do I care about what other people think? Yeah. Actually, I do. But why do I want this attention? I'm in a committed relationship with someone I'm very much in love with. I don't have many friends, but I have a good relationship with my family, my cousins, my siblings. And somehow, the idea of being in a room with someone smaller than me makes me panic. I'll do anything to be the cuter one in a group. I've spent hours on YouTube makeup tutorials for bigger eyes and longer eyelashes and defining freckles. I've spent too much money on circle lenses. I've spent too much time on my hair. I've sold hundreds of dollars worth of high heel shoes so I couldn't add a single centimeter to my already-short height. I've missed uni classes because I didn't think I looked ""cute"" enough to be out in public. I'm like some freakshow that you should be watching on My Strange Addiction.

I know what you're probably thinking. ""This narcissistic chick needs to grow the hell up."" The worst part is: I know this. I know this, and that's what makes me panic even more. I want to not care about this as much as I do. I want to finally grow up and act my own damn age. I just don't know what to do, where to start. I just don't want to feel inferior to cuter people anymore. Why does being ""cute"" monitor my self-worth in my eyes? I think I'm pretty smart. I think I'm pretty funny. I have a good job and make good money. So why do I keep clinging to this idea that being an icon of a ""cute"" person is all I'm worth? Why can't I just be X?

29,"I didn't even know it could be like that.  I almost killed myself.  My worst emotions and thoughts became my only thoughts on Luvox, and I went cold turkey and feel better.  I didn't know medication could do that.  I've been on so many and never had a reaction like this before.  Has anyone else?",28Jun2017,1
30,"I am only posting this as I need somewhere that I can put into words how I feel anonymously. I just need to get everything off my chest as I am feeling the closest to breaking point than I have so far right now. I know these problems are irrelevant when compared to the struggles other people face, but they are weighing immensely on me none the less. To start off I am a 22 year old male, recently graduated from university with grades that a lot of people would consider good. I have had some health troubles over the past years, none immediately life treating, but definitely life altering. I have had bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts since I was 17, however since I have finished college my mind has been dwelling on every negative aspect of my life and I no longer want to live, although I am terrified to die. I know that is a contradictory statement but I will go into more detail.

I feel totally alone and isolated. I have no friends at all. I made no permanent friends through out my years in college. I am the type of person that people seem to tolerate when around but will never seek me out or invite me places if they feel they don't have to. What I mean by that is that I will get invited to class events and such, but no one will want me at smaller gatherings. Furthermore, there has even been times when I have proposed trips with someone, and they have decided to go on those trips without me. It isn't that these are just mean people, because they truly are nice people, instead I feel it must be something inherently wrong with me such that people do not want to get close to me or befriend me. My course has been pretty intensive over the last few years, and as a result have mostly lost contact with any friends I made in my younger years. These people have moved on with there lives, and no longer seem to be able to make time to hang out with me anymore. This too is understandable. In every group of people I have been in I always try to be the clown who makes people laugh, cause I figure that if I can get them to find me funny then they will like me, (obviously this has not worked), as a result I don't think anyone knows the way I really feel inside although there were days when I felt my mask slip.

In terms of romantic relationships, they are non-existent. I have never had one or ever been close to one. I have only ever asked out 2 people in my life and been rejected both times. This is another area of my life where I am desperately unhappy and just wish I had somebody who cared. I wouldn't consider myself attractive, but I try my best (again) to win girls over with my sense of humour but again nobody seems to want to get close to me.

Having recently graduated I am under pressure from a lot of people to make the next step in my career. My final grades are pretty good (equivalent to a GPA of 3.94 in US) however in spite of this I would not consider myself intelligent. I feel I simply know how to drill information into my head until I can adequately answer a specific set of questions which appear on exams. I don't feel I have enough experience or general intelligence to make an impact in any of the fields I am interested in, and I don't simply want to slide into a comfortable job where I know I will be even more unhappy. I can't even properly think of what I want to apply for due to these negative thoughts. On top of this while my grades might get me into a few of the postgraduate courses I am interested in, money is incredibly tight. My family are a working class family where money has never been plentiful, I would not expect financial support from my family as they simply do not have it. Throughout my years studying I have been saving away in preparation of a postgraduate course however I am still coming up several thousand short, meaning I am likely going to have to put those dreams on hold no matter what.

I feel the fact I have done well in school contributed to me not fitting in. I come from a pretty rough area which has high levels of drug use, most people I was friends with there were simply happy to just get a nice stable job after school, which is totally great but I was always trying to push for more and would spend my time studying rather than out drinking or socialising. Upon getting into university, while I am now surrounded by people with similar ambitions, these people typically come from well off areas. I have quite a distinctive accent and personality which is a result of growing up where I am from which I felt has alienated me from these people for the majority of my time in university and it wasn't till the end before people made attempts to get to know me. 

On top of this I have had a strained relationship with my father for a number of years. There are a number of reasons for this which I will not get into now but no matter what I do we can not seem to see eye to eye and the atmosphere at home is often very tense, which is having a negative effect on everyone else in the house.

These are just some of the reasons I can think of right now as to why I no longer want to live. While this is the case, i have witnessed the effects of suicide first hand when I was younger. A family member of similar age to I am now committed suicide and the effects it had on their parents and younger siblings has stuck with me. I do not want to to do the same thing to my mother and younger siblings, this is the only reason why I have not and probably won't ever do it. Instead I am stuck in an existence where what should be the best years of my life are being spent in misery with no sign of escape. ",28Jun2017,1
31,"I hope I can still piece together a coherent piece of text to give you some background info; here goes.

I am in my early thirties and an **Aspie**, but have not been formally diagnosed as such during childhood, since in the 80's/90's such a diagnosis was not really known in Belgium. It has later on (early thirties) been confirmed that I clearly suffer from it.

Anyway, I've had **many psychological and other problems throughout life** that seemed isolated at first: (social) anxieties, depression, hypochondria, some anger issues, personality disorders, bullying, etc. In retrospect they can all be explained by my Asperger's/autism. Academically I have nevertheless been able to complete a PhD; relationship-wise, nothing really worked; I've had quite a lot of relationships varying from a couple of months to a couple of years, but they ultimately all failed due to (in all honesty and in retrospect) my lack of understanding, empathy, love, social abilities, etc. at the time. I **compensated** from age 25 onward by going to the gym a lot and somehow **""mimicked"" social people around me** unconsciously. At first glance, I simply became one of the guys and went out with a group of socially well-adjusted friends that befriended what I would now call my outgoing ""alter ego.""

Sadly, I apparently often **drank quite some alcohol** when I went out simply to be able to cope with being around a lot of people (I know it's bad, but my social anxiety regarding talking to new people, girls, being somewhat loose, etc. would otherwise have been hell for me as an Aspie, yet I wanted to be part of life and going out; I wasn't even consciously aware of the fact that I drank that much at those moments and would probably have denied it then, since the amounts that I drank generally didn't cause me to feel or act drunk). I have regularly been drinking 10 (or more) units of alcohol during the weekend (single night) when going out and have been doing so for 12+ years (I never drank during the week or at home, I must add, so I did not consider my weekend/going-out drinking problematic at all at the time).

Fast forward to today: I can **hardly remember** my childhood, grammar school, university, Christmasses, own birthdays, social activities with my parents, etc. and I **cannot readily retain new information at all**. I forget events that happened earlier during the day or the day before, I get lost in familiar locations, am unable to keep track of time, etc. As a consequence, I now live with my parents again (yes, it's shameful, but it's the sad truth). I cannot really take care of myself and I do not get out of the house anymore and hardly see my friends. The gripping fear of not being able to remember anything and not being able to create new memories is paralysing. Not being able to perform basic ""executive functioning"" is debilitating. Worst of all, this didn't become apparent to me or my friends until last year, when ""cracks"" started to appear in my behaviour (forgetting things and some strange/agitated behaviour).

Anyway, I **talked to my doctor about euthanasia** a couple of months ago and he is willing to consider it (possible for mental illness in Belgium), since he can imagine -- as I explained it -- life as such not being worthwhile (it's torture every day) anymore for someone in his thirties (especially since nothing can be done to restore someone's memories and cognitive abilities). However, I am terrified of dying and ""ceasing to exist"" and these thoughts go through my mind all day long (*literally*; I do not think of anything else besides my amnesia/dementia and my impending death and cry a lot throughout the day).

At this point I would *really* like to be able to believe in the possibility of living again in some form (""eternal (modified) return"", reincarnation, some afterlife; you name it), but it's hard for me as I've always been quite an outspoken atheist. You know, having a second chance without the Asperger's and not resorting to (social) anxiety coping mechanisms... The other alternative is living on like this, which is basically a miserable existence.

**What would you** do in this case and how would you approach death and the accompanying possible/probable oblivion (if that was your choice)?",28Jun2017,2
32,"I've been hesitant to post about what I've been feeling because I'm not really sure what I'm looking for in response - maybe just affirmation or understanding.  I struggled with depression and anxiety awhile ago that was amplified by medication I've recently stopped taking.  Most of my days are content and calm, but there's a weird sense I can't shake.  I have this brain fogginess that damages my focus and detail at work, and I also find myself having memory issues.  I used to remember most details and situations, but it takes me so long to recall what I'm trying to retrieve.  And the brain fog has been hitting me for months, and I'm now returning to that loss-of-interest, sleep all day mindset.  Has anyone has any similar experiences?  What are some natural, lifestyle remedies that have worked?  I haven't considered medication, but it might be the answer soon if these moods keep interfering with my job, relationship and daily well-being.",28Jun2017,7
35,"And by ""small"" I mean in amounts that would fall within the limits that health agencies recommend.  Obviously no two people have the exact same chemistry, so I'm just wondering what the *general* case is.  We've all heard that binge drinking does horrible things to every part of your body, but I've never heard anything similar for moderate drinking except that **you should follow whatever your doctor recommends if he/she sets stricter requirements**.

I never drink more than three drinks in a day, at most twice a week, and my psychiatrist has said that this limit is acceptable given my regimen of medications.  However, I sometimes notice that my depression feels more severe on days after I have had anything at all to drink.  On the other hand, on other days when I've drunk the day before I've felt perfectly fine.

I'm going to drink nothing at all for the next week to see if I notice a difference, but I thought I'd pose the question anyhow.  ",28Jun2017,5
37,"A friend of mine moved to Africa for a year, but was in a very violent armed assault about two months in. 

He was sent home but quickly returned to Africa again - without getting help and clearly in denial. 

Soon after he cut all contact with everyone he knew - family, friends, girlfriend. When he visited about a month ago he told me he had hated being back in Africa until one day when he had just woken up and fucking loved everything about it. Now he hates being back home, and just want to stay in Africa. 

He's clearly changed. No one felt like they knew him anymore when he was visiting, and he was acting very strange. Bragging and telling lies about how great everything was (I know for a fact now, that they were lies). He wasn't a nice guy to be around anymore it felt like. 


What is going on? 
Is this something you see in people who have had traumatic experiences? Suddenly changing personality and cutting out everything that has to do with his previous life.. 

And how should we handle it when he's coming home in about 2 months? His employment ends and he has to come home to finish his masters.

According to him he just wishes he could stay in Africa and never return. 

I'm really, really worried about what will happen when he does come home......",28Jun2017,2
38,"I think this is my first post, please go easy on me. Also, hello from Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada.

I suffer from major depression and I'm currently getting treatment for it. At the moment I'm doing trail runs of different medications to help my state of being, but it isn't going very well. I have a job with the Territorial Government (NWT) and I'm only able to work half-time as prescribed by my psychiatrist (well, one of many. I see a different one every week - perks of living in the middle of nowhere).

Before June 2016 I was off work for a year. I didn't receive EI or any advice on how to apply for disability of any kind (short term or long term). Since last June, I've been at work on and off and I've become unable to pay rent or buy groceries.

Today I just got an email from Industrial Alliance (my employers insurer) saying that my claim has been rejected.  This news comes after 5 months of review, citing they had insufficient medical evidence and my claim was submitted too late. They say to submit your claim within 3 weeks of having your disability. I've had this disability since I was 11, undiagnosed and untreated until the last two years. 

It seems impossible to get coverage for this type of disability. 
I spent 1 year putting my claim together. I have no idea what to do now. I've plummeted into significant debt ($45,000) and I don't have a way out, unless I get better and work my ass off for the next 30 years.

What do I do? I've never felt so helpless. My condition has never been worse. I've honestly considered selling my organs for financial help.

Is there anyone in Canada who has some advice?",28Jun2017,5
