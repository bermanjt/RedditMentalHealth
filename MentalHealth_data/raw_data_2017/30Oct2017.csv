1,"So I was diagnosed with depression awhile ago and have really been working on it, and making lots of progress, to the point where I would say I'm not depressed, although I never really thought I was too much. But something I've noticed is that if I'm drinking, it takes me less booze to get to the ""sweet spot"". But now when I'm hungover I'm a mental mess. Nervous anxious and depressed. Like worse than I ever have been. Is it just I'm noticing it more not that my baseline is higher, cause it doesn't even seem like that. Any insight? Obviously stop drinking is a good idea but that's exactly what I'm asking. It's more to do with the affects, and how they're changing with increased mental health. ",30Oct2017,1
2,"Hi, so I've been feeling like this for a while now. I can't focus for shit on anything. I feel like days just go by and when I try to remember things i just can't because I wasn't paying attention or they just didn't stuck w me. The thing is, till now I've always been one to have a good memory and I still can memorize things pretty fast but this inability to focus and the fact that my immediate past looks foggy makes me feel really really unsure of myself and just unstable. It's begun to affect my academic life and while my grades haven't gone down a lot, they have been worse the last couple of months. I have been going through some stuff lately and there are a bunch of things from the past that have left some trauma. I'm also under quite a bit of stress due to this project I have to do (which I'm having a really hard time doing because my brain feels all over the place). 
So, anyone knows what could cause this? Anyone experiencing/experienced the same thing? I know I'm not the best at explaining myself (this had never happened to me before) but I hope I made myself clear enough.


TLDR: been finding it hard to focus on anything lately. My mind feels foggy and all over the place when I try to remember stuff or just focus. I have no idea why this could be happening. Any thoughts?",30Oct2017,2
3,"I've struggled with depression for the last ten years or so and suicidal thoughts for the last six years. Right now I'm 17, so you could chop all of my symptoms to simple mood swings, but I just don't know anymore. For the last few years, it's been hard to identify my mood and symptoms because I can't tell what's normal and what's not. For me, normal is having fleeting suicidal thoughts and plans come to mind every day--even though I don't act on it.

Recently, actually, I can't tell if I could call it recently. I believe it started at the beginning of the school year. Around August. I call them 'episodes'. But from what I've looked up, I don't know if they are. 

My situation is very different. I'm suicidal--that's the only thing I can say for sure. I have typical symptoms of depression, hopelessness, fatigue, apathy and few symptoms of anxiety racing thoughts, worry, fear, nausea (most prevalent; usually I throw up) and trembling. But I also don't seem ""depressed"" per say. For once, my motivation is great with school. I am an overachiever and I'm never satisfied with myself. I'm in the top 10% (number four) and I worry constantly about it. I OBSESS over my grades. If I try hard on a project and I get something besides an A, I break down. For the rest of the day, I have dozens of intrusive and suicidal thoughts. I cry hysterically if I'm alone. A lot of the times I'm at school so I only cry when I'm with my friends and I have to keep all my screams inside. I scratch at myself, my hands, my arms, thighs, I bang my head against walls, I hurt myself with pencils or pens. At that point, my mind is overwhelmed with thoughts and I just want to die. I can't concentrate. I feel like I go crazy. But I don't grow discouraged, I grow extremely angry at myself. Then guilty, then angry, and it keeps going to the point where I just want to die because I'm crazy and I don't deserve to live and I can't handle life and I wish I wasn't born but I'm stuck because I can't kill myself or else I'll hurt my friends and families. 

This situation happens often. I'd say minimum once a week, normally it's around three or two times during the weekdays. The longest time it lasts is for eight hours, which is rare. Usually, it takes me around half to one hour to gain back control. Afterwards, come the actual feelings of depression where I get immensely tired and apathetic. And then sometimes, it's just gone in an instant and I am completely normal. I laugh normally, I talk normally, I'm just normal. I don't get it. Everything is abrupt. Something as simple as dropping my pencil sets me up for an episode and after I'm done, poof, I'm normal.

It's gotten to the point where I don't know if this is just my personality. I'm going to counseling but sometimes I can't word my situation properly. I already take medication, two of them. I get enough sleep, too much actually, and I wake up tired. Although I can stay up when I feel hyper--if I'm excited--when I'm with my friends. Then wake up normally. 

It feels like there's another person inside me. I often refer to it as ""her"" because it's like another part of me. The one I'm trying to kill--but if I do, I'll kill myself. I don't know what to do anymore. My best friend helps me but we're both at loss. She's done so much I sometimes convince myself she's tired of me and that she just does it for pity. No matter how many times she tells she's not, it's still the conclusion my mind takes. 

I'm scared, I'm exhausted, I'm hopeless, I can't take it anymore.",30Oct2017,4

8,"First off, I've been pretty depressed for a long time (probably since middle school).  I'm 40 now, and a military vet. 

Grew up as a gay kid in the Appalachian South.  As a kid being noticeably gay I got made fun of a lot and didnt have many guy friends (none really) since i lived in an extremely small community, ~1000 people in the entire community and only about 300 kids in the high school.  I'm pretty sure this has something to do with my depression.  I went on to become an RN, and i'm also a navy vet (was an officer in the Navy's Nurse Corps).

Anyway, I'm 40 now and the gay thing is what it is.  However the depression is getting pretty bad.  I'm no suicidal, but I am very manic at times and compulsive.  I get these crazy ideas to do something and I MUST DO IT RIGHT NOW!!!  Then I do and usually regret it (make purchases I don't need, etc).  Financially I'm fine, no debt except my house and vehicle, so this part of my crazy isn't really too bad.  But I could be a little better at saving.

But heres what is not ok - I want to be alone all the time.  I don't even want to see my family (they're great).  I just want to sit at home alone and not leave.  Since I got out of the military (less than a year ago) I've gained like 30 lbs.  I have NO motivation to do anything.  

But here the weirdest thing - I went out of town this past weekend, my first time traveling in like 7 months.  I did NOT want to go, preferring to stay at home, but my sister and bro in law talked me into it.  I'm glad I went, i felt pretty happy.  So, I'm in a store in the mall and I see this handicapped young guy.  Probably 20.  He looks like he maybe has spina bifida (he was totally ok mentally, I overheard his conversation with the shoe salesman as he was buying his Nikes) but had a noticable limp and arm contraction on the left.  I felt so sorry for him.  And i literally teared up right there in the store thinking about how hard his life must be.  I got so emotional right there and I couldn't control it.  I felt like a total idiot standing there in the sports store!  I didnt boo-hoo or anything, but I did get very teary-eyed and could NOT stop thinking about that poor kid and just wanted to be his friend cause I was afraid he didnt have any.  

I""m a mess and I drink a lot.  Probably twice a week on my nights off.

Ugh  I know i probably need to go be seen by a doctor but being a medical professional myself, I think sometimes I neglect my own issues.  Anyone else feel like I do?",30Oct2017,1
10,"So I've [26F] been noticing my mental acuity has been decreasing over the past few years to the point where I can't seem to recall what my last thought was. It's pretty terrifying, I feel like I'm losing my mind. It's becoming increasingly difficult differentiating between my own memories and things that I've been told/read/seen in movies. I've also been dealing with fairly serious chronic pain for the past 7 years due to a car accident and drunken idiocy. I've been searching for psychiatrists in my network and haven't been able to find any near me.

I had this feeling for a good  twenty minutes. I had to breathe in through my nose and out of my mouth slowly because if I tried to just breathe from my nose I would start to hyperventilate. I'm just kinda confused on what happened for me to have that feeling because I can't think of anything that gave me really bad anxiety at that moment.

12,"I have been suffering from bad mental health symptoms for a while now, but I’m scared to go to a therapist. While researching my symptoms, I see certain mental illnesses that I could possibly have (I haven’t self-diagnosed because I’m no professional), and they all seem to spur off from childhood trauma, so, here’s a (kind of) short version of my story:

I’m currently 17, but when I was 11 and in the sixth grade, I got bullied to the point that I had to transfer schools. I had went to this school since kindergarten, formed close relationships with so many people there, and I really just knew everyone. There was one girl I was friends with for years, but things started to change when we hit middle school age. I can’t remember exactly how it happened because I have blocked so much of it out of my mind, but I know she started rumors about me, turned almost everyone in our grade against me, and ultimately caused my middle school boyfriend to break up with me, which was devastating to my 11 year old self. My whole life, I have been very easily intimidated, so I didn’t take this very well. I even  had permission from the principal to punch her in the face, but I’m very non-confrontational and I just couldn’t do it. I knew she was making people talk behind my back and I even found notes where she had made things up about me. She really had absolutely no reason to do all this. I was devastated. I had barely any real friends anymore. I went home and cried every day. I was 11 years old and had a doctor’s referral to be put on anti-depressants. It got to the point to where I left school at almost the end of the year, in April. There are other things that occurred, but I only know about them through what my mom says since I have honestly blocked so much of it out. I had to be homeschooled from April through the next school year, and then transferred to another public school in 7th grade. I had to move away from all the people I knew, everything I had gotten used to, all the close friends I made, it was all gone. Just like that, it was all stripped away from me and things would never be the same again. I never talked to any of them again, except two of them, but that ended quickly. I also have to note that I have had other “traumatic” events that happened in my life even before that, but my issues worsened exponentially after that.

But, back to my question, can something like that really cause so much trauma? Could this specifically be referred to as childhood trauma, since I was 11? I have so many issues that I can’t work out and so many problems that need to be confronted. It’s getting worse and worse, but I’m terrified of opening up to anyone, even a therapist. I’m terribly avoidant, but I know I need help. It’s just hard. ",30Oct2017,1
13,"I keep getting ragged on for using anti-depressants and benzos.  [Mainly the benzos.]  Even though I don't abuse.

14,"This might get long, but I just need to get this off my chest.
The title says it all. I'm in high school. In the past year, many mental issues have begun to affect my life. I can't focus on  anymore and I don't understand anything. I get distracted very easily, but tests have shown I don't have ADD or anything like that. I've isolated myself (which I'm totally fine with), and I've been diagnosed with social anxiety. Even though I absolutely hate social interaction, I'm completely fine with being alone and actually enjoy loneliness, and I don't care if other people judge me. However, what I do hate is when my family forces me to attend parties or social events, or when they take me to therapy (because I don't like speaking to others about my problems). I feel overwhelmed with school even though I'm in the top 5 of my grade. Also, my grades have lowered, and even though everyone else still sees me as a good student, I'm not satisfied with my grades and I don't know how to get them back. I'm also very close with my family and my home country and have lived in a different country since I was like 6, but recently it's been really hard for me. I feel anxiety about what the future may hold for me. I don't know what to do with my life, and I'm certain that my life will end someday because of suicide even though I have things to live for right now. I just feel like I'm not enjoying it anymore even though I have hobbies that I truly like and I love my family. It doesn't help that I have PTSD (I can't really say why because it is something I'll take to the grave) and think about it everyday. Even though my family is very supporting of me, the English language has been forced upon me and I just really miss my home country (which is Venezuela, but I can't go back because of obvious reasons) and I feel like I'm forgetting my native language more and more everyday. If I could go back in time and decide to not be born, I would do it in a heartbeat.",30Oct2017,2
15,"Hi everyone. I'd love to know if anyone could help me with coming more out of my shell? I'm starting to realize that my isolation from people is just not what I want from life, and even though I put myself into situations for possible socializing, I just end up staying in my own world and I am tired of this same old routine. So do any of you have any pointers for what ultimately allowed you to open up more? For further context, I'm a 21 year old, only-child, student (who still lives at home with a loving mother, but I feel so compelled to move out and get on with my life already), raised in a small city and now lives in a big city, with a developing chronic health problem that I'm learning to accept and not let it crush my soul; I'm obsessive about certain things because of growing up in an unstable yet non-abusive family-life (I've been learning how to let things go) and I have very intrusive and dangerous thoughts. I'm relatively fit and I have an OCD healthy diet, and I'm relatively average looking. My life feels better with CBD dominant marijuana (contrary to my dumb username, I actually never smoke), but any marijuana has actually just worsened the symptoms of my developing health problem and I have to carefully plan smoking sessions because weed is still good enough for the experience.

16,"(17/f/Ontario) I’ve never played an active roll in my mental health, it’s just something that happens to me, and I feel like it is all out of my control.

I don’t know if I am bipolar or depressed, but I often feel extremely sad and hopeless for periods of time (days). I also often have thoughts of suicide, and not many people to reach out to. I’ve always struggled with my emotions when I was younger, so most of my closest connections assume I’m just overreacting. 

A couple weeks ago I desperately wanted to kill myself, and tried to write my suicide note, but couldn’t bring myself to do it out of fear of what a disappointment I would be to my mother. 

I also have anxiety attacks at school. Most days I have to wear ear plugs at school because I get afraid of all the sounds around me, and it feels like I can hear everything, as if it’s closing in around me. Places I get the most scared are places with lots of people (hallways, classrooms, anywhere with crowds really). 

My doctor has been taking 3-4 weeks to refer me to a specialist, and until then I can’t get on any type of medication. Until I get to a point where I can figure out what’s going on, does anybody have any idea what this is? Depression? Anxiety? Bipolar of some sort??",30Oct2017,1

I've been terribly depressed lately, much more so than the usual. I've been depressed for 3-4 years but only just got treatment a few months ago. I'm currently seeing a counselor and I'm on some meds (they're still trying to figure out what will work, so it's not nearly 100% yet). I'm just scared to tell my counselor that I wish I was dead, that I've attempted suicide and just how much I want to hurt myself. I know that I can be forced into a psych ward for this, and honestly that's terrifying. I've had two immediate family members go, and I visited one while he was being held. He looked so dead and he never really came back as the same guy. I've heard a lot from others I know who have gone too. There seems to be a huge lack of privacy and a lot of condescending talk. I'm also not good with being surrounded by people I don't know without reliable contact from those I trust. I wouldn't be ok with having the door cracked while I'm in the bathroom, or being forced to socialize with people I'm not comfortable with, or just being locked up in a facility and treated like a baby. It sounds like hell and that's just the beginning of what I've heard. But I really do need help. I wish I could tell my counselor what I feel, because I really do trust him, but I also know counselors are mandatory reporters for this stuff.

26,"Hello, for background - my girlfriend of about 3 years has struggled with GAD and depression most of her life. She has been seeing a therapist regularly for the past few years and is on a few medications. Recently she started with a new therapist and has been uncovering some events in her past that she has suppressed at a young age.

In the last few months I feel like I've been witnessing her give up and collapse in on herself. She's dropped her classes and is backing out of opportunities she was over the moon about 6 months ago. She constantly tells me that she feels to tired to do anything and can't make it through the day. She's mentioned suicidal thoughts and feelings like she can't go on. She's starting seeing her therapist twice a week but still seems like she's given up. I always try to be as patient as possible because her mental health is my top priority, but I don't want her to look back to this time in the future and feel like she threw her life away and regret anything.

I suppose my question is how can I be as patient and present for her as I need to be, while continuing to help her towards her goals. I know it's good for her to have something to work towards and I don't want her to abandon her lifelong dreams, but I also don't want to push her into anything that she's not up for or can't handle.

I should have the best life as I have a degree, a masters, a great family, great friends, a relatively well off upbringing and I get a decent amount of female attention and have modeller a lot before. However, I spend everyday crying for hours and thinking about dying, I have no appetite and I don't like doing anything and it's been like this for the last few months. I had an ex girlfriend who was on and off nice to me. We got on really well but she messed me around a lot and there was a lot of lying. When she found out in the relationship about my depression, in fact we had an argument and the same night I drunkenly tried to commit suicide but my friend came to pick me up. The next day she asked to go on a break when she found out which obviously would make me feel worse as I was willing to commit suicide over an argument.

I've also recently graduated university and moved back home to a town where I have barely any friends and haven't got a job yet so have spent the last two months thinking about my ex all day and all the fun all the fun my friends and my ex are still having at university. I think I was happy when together with my ex because it was the only thing taking my mind off my depression but she was also quite manipulative and I knew it wasn't best for me so when I broke up with her I thought it was the right decision initially  and was happy but since thinking loads have tried to get back but she now hates me. I hate how low my confidence is and it feels like the only fun thing in my life is going back to my university town and going out with my friends on nights out but the alcohol makes me really sad and I've attempted suicide twice when drinking it.

29,"Hello, my name is Gabriel and I was diagnosed with anxiety and hypochodriac disorder a few months ago. My anxiety symptoms went away, but I still have some moments when i feel lightheaded (this happens when i am in a place i am not comfortable in or have some stupid thoughts), muscle tension, tiredness, moments when I think ""well, i'm sure I'm not gonna reach 30"" and stupid thoughts, but at least I am not dizzy as before, I am not losing balance anymore, the blur vision went away, no more headaches, I don't have panic attacks which is great. ~~and also i'm not so hypochondriac anymore, at least talking about organ diseases... but now i think i am mentally hypochondriac.
So... coming back to the stupid thoughts.. i think that my mind invents fears when it's bored... Like HARM OCD, there were thoughts that were scaring the shit out of me in which i imagined killing my family in so many ways and after that killing myself. Thoughts that went away with the autosugestion ""those are just thoughts, it's only in my head, it will never happen"". I had moments when I thought I was having psychosis episoded when the faces of my classmates seemed to scare me (i got to the conclussion that i was auto inducing this... like, maybe everything else ) or when I was waking up from nightmares terrified and hoping not to hear voices or lose control. Well.. I've cured from those above, maybe I went insane (which is a fear of mine) and stop giving a shit about them. But now I have a constant thought (that kinda makes me worried) which is that i never had my own personality or i lost it... maybe it's a personality crisis, i don't know, you name it. I've always been imitating a character from a movie after seeing it, a character from a book after reading it (now I have moments when I am Will Greyson), a person that I liked, when I started wishing to go to an artistic college and become an actor I was giving myself a new character everyday and yeah.. all those characters are fighting against me, mentally.Maybe my anxiety lead me to this personality crisis because I am afraid to do something that I enjoyed in the past (like drinking, smoking, watching gore or horror movies, wander the whole town feeling invicible), but I kinda have thoughts that contradict in my head like... half of my mind is atheist and the other part is a christian, like half of my mind likes a person and the other part doesn't. My friends told me that I am someone else everyday....
I kinda miss the old me everyday, the bastard who didn't give a shit about dying and doing a lot of stupid things... maybe if my parents went with me to a psychiatric when my random panic attacks began (which started after two weeks after a horrible experience when i got high accidentaly with 350mg of dextrometorphan and where i had 6 hours of constant panic attacks) maybe now I would've been normal. We went to a psychiatrist after living with the anxiety and it's symptoms for almost 3 months (after i had a major panic attack where i couldn't breathe and my mom said ""that's it.. i'm making an appoinment for you next week"")and the psych gave me 0.25mg of xanax and serlift (serotonin inhibitors i think) and sent me for 3 sessions at a psycho therapist, but I never took the pills and I got better (talking only about the anxiety symptoms) without them, but now I have those stupid thoughts....

30,"Hi all

I couldn't tell you when this all happened, but over the past few years I've become more and more reserved. I used to be a warm, bubbly and funny person, but it feels more and more like I'm losing stability. 

I've been called cold by my family and I have these harsh mood swings - I can go from being relatively upbeat one minute to being really self-conscious and down the next. I feel a lot like I'm losing control. I can't control my emotions one way or the other - sometimes I am way too under-emotional (for example, getting good results in my exams, I had basically no reaction at all, not even a good feeling) but when I am emotional (which is few and far between) it comes out in an uncontrollable flood, usually of anger.

This is combined with a severe lack of confidence when it comes to romance. I am deeply romantically inept and this has put me in a vicious circle of fear of rejection and lack of confidence. 

I also find it impossible to relax. Even when I am playing on my PC, I feel bad that I'm not working and all of this is running in the back of my mind. I can't switch off  - I don't know how to.

Anyone been like this before?",30Oct2017,2
31,"It is really difficult for me to put my thoughts into words, like every time when I'm having a conversation or an argument with someone I can't get my point across. I don't even know how to put it simple thoughts into words, unless they are not my honest/real opinions or feelings. The thoughts are like on the tip of my tongue but I can't say what I really think. It really frustrates me, sometimes I fucking hate myself because I feel so fucking helpless and weak, I feel like  imploding. Like when you are trying to justify your decisions but you cannot say what you really think and the person you are talking to keeps repeating the same stuff. That stuff (and so much more) that you have already taken into account before making the decision. BUT you just can't speak up, this gives me such a nasty feeling. It's like a combo of shame, guilt, anger, self hatred, restlessness, fatigue and confusion. ",30Oct2017,10
32,"1. I'm 20 years old 

2. I live with my parents and siblings (we have a large family), mainly due to the fact that my parents (in accordance to the Bible) believe women are not to be the sole provider, and they didn't want me moving out until I get married (unless I really wanted to work and move out on my own accord, but I am not able to do so). Money is tight and I'm such a burden to them...so it's very difficult to deal with on a daily basis. I'm a hard worker, over achiever and a deep thinker, but I have many debilitating limitations.

3. I can't drive due to some learning disabilities and physical/mental health issues. 

4. I don't have an official high school diploma, because I couldn't keep up with the workload and had to drop out of some classes that I could not grasp.

5. My anxiety/panic attacks, OCD, schizophrenia, depression, agoraphobia, eating disorder, learning disabilities (these conditions go hand-in hand: auditory and regular dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyspraxia, sensory processing disorder, etc.), chronic pain, exhaustion, weak immunity, a genetic condition that makes it difficult for my body to rid itself of toxins, skin conditions, etc, make it incredibly hard to live. Most of these health issues haven't been 'officially' diagnosed (but many run in my family already) and I doubt any of them would count as a true disability. 

6. I'm an outcast that is constantly getting rejected. Majority of the church goers/friends that surround me don't understand mental (or even physical) health issues, my family dynamics and predicaments, why I have to live the way I do, and etc. It's hard to get any kind of help when the people around don't understand or judge me so negatively. I need help and I want help. I feel so overwhelmed with sorrow and hopelessness, especially today.

7. I research and study for hours on end trying to empower myself, put up a fight to survive, and heal. My family has a lot of health issues, both mental and physical, and I want to help them. I'm fighting to figure this out and I have so many hopes and dreams for the future (my main desire, through my love of health, nutrition, researching and gaining knowledge, is to use my life to help others, to be a voice for the voiceless, to fight for our health and rights, to care for the earth and those living in it). I'm not lazy, and never want to be. I'm currently working through the long process of completing a brain integration therapy program with a few of my siblings and myself. I've been eating clean and healthy strictly for almost an entire year. I also help my family by selling items on eBay, cleaning, cooking, studying and researching for answers and information that will help us heal and be more financially stable. But sadly, it's not enough most times. I'm coming to the realization that I am running out of time (my original plan was to heal my body and brain, help my family do the same, finish therapy by next November, finish school to get a diploma and to potentially work at my library, isn't coming along fast enough).
 I don't have the money to get better, I can barely work outside the house (only to babysit occasionally), I can't drive (or have the means to), I can't go to a counselor, I don't have enough money for the food I need to get healed, and I don't know what to do anymore. 
My family needs money for almost anything and everything to help us all move forward (health, medical/alternative intervention therapies, projects around the home, affording the expenses of adding more drivers, eliminating toxins in our bodies and home, etc.). I just need someone to talk to so I can get some help and receive more options. I need someone to not judge me or look at me as a negative person (because I'm not and I'm not in control of the negatives that have been heavy-laden in my life), I want to be honest, and I need someone to allow me to be without any cruelty or condemnation. I don't want to give up. Again, at this point I can't get an official job, because it would count against my family financially (long story), and it would be virtually worthless to get a 'job' because the money I would make wouldn't make up for the amount that was taken away from my family for me having a job (limitations listed above...). I don't want to depend on the government and neither does my family. I feel like I'm stranded in a labyrinth with no escape. Any advice would be so helpful and appreciated by me! 
Thank you. 💕🌿",30Oct2017,4

I have a friend who has gone off her meds recently and I'm pretty sure it's not going so well. Separately both her boyfriend and their roommate have reached out to me. She's being hit by some pretty severe mood swings, sleeplessness, and general unhappiness. I'm told her doc told her she was doing well and to keep up with her prescription, but she feels she wasn't herself under it's influence and decided without council to outright stop. 

We all want to talk to her about it but I'm terrified of saying something stupid and making things worse or putting her into a defensive stance.

39,"hey! i live in BC, canada. i dont wanna give away my exact city but ill give a hint: its ridiculously expensive to live here!!!!! but at least weed is easy to get!!!!!!! :')

so uh.. i dont even really know where to begin. my family isn't the most financially well off (its a miracle that we even live in this city) and we all have our own mental health problems but its hard for any of us to get real help because everythings really expensive!! i did take some free counselling but it didnt really help.. the counsellors didnt wanna listen to my problems and just wanted to teach me how to cope (so many deep breathing exercises!!), and the psychiatrist was really lazy with diagnosis and just wanted to give me drugs.

so anyways.. my dad has PTSD because of a rough childhood. im not sure if these are PTSD symptoms but he will often ignite a situation that escalates quickly, then turn it around and make it seem like he's the victim and that im conspiring against him (he does the same to my mom and sister). in the process he will very often bring up his childhood and talk about how hard he had it.. i feel really bad for him but he completely disregards my families feelings. if i were to have a panic attack about something he would tell me about how he would have panic attacks everyday when he was 7 because of his parents (therefore trying to make my problems seem like theyre lesser. he says thats not what he means to do but its what happens lol). when i was stressed about high school (ive graduated,im 18) he would tell me about how he paid for private school all by himself and worked full time as well and he still enjoyed school therefore i shouldnt be stressed. at almst every oppurtunity he gets, if im upset, he will bring up his childhood and tell me im lucky cuz i was never beaten. its! annoying! and with regards to igniting a situation that escalates quickly well... i have an axolotl and ive never taken care of an animal myself before so i want to make sure i dont accidentally kill him or anything right? and so my dad will try to help and i might question him or say id like to double check what hes saying and he gets offended, says i distrust him, talks about how he raised fish as a child (axolotls arent fish!!!!!!) and storms out of my room. 2 days ago he was about to put a frozen stainless steel bottle in the tank to cool the water and noticed a hole in it so i asked what kind of water was in it and he tried storming out of my room because i asked a question :| if it was chlorinated water it could have killed my axie. apparently on the same day he got angry at my mom for asking ""how are you"" .. he said she was giving her dirty looks when she was literally just asking how are u!! i dont understand and it makes me scared almost. my mom thinks he might even be bipolar or something. afterwards i texted him about why i was bothered by him storming out of my room cuz of the water bottle situation and it escalated into me calling out his shitty behaviours (like victimizing himself and making every situation revolve around him and his feelings) and he's saying im blowing this out of proportion and now im scared of going into the kitchen to make myself food before work cuz i dont wanna talk to him before :) i cant be crying before work i work with little kids!!!!

basically what im wondering is.. how can i get affordable counselling or therapy for him so he can stop putting his emotional baggage on me and my family. we love him but its HIS baggage and not ours. he doesnt even know about my baggage at all!! he knows so little about us and he says he wants to know more and says he puts in so much effort to connect with us but he just victimizes himself at every oppurtunity. i dont want to hate him in my 30s, he really needs help!! and i guess i do too because i have severe GAD and probably a whole whack of undiagnosed shit cuz no one ever let me just talk. im scared of even just talking to my mom about my mental health bc if my dad finds out he'll get mad at me for trusting mom more than him. if anyone knows of any helpful and **affordable** (either free or way less than 100+ an hour) places to get help for me and my family in BC please reply or pm me :(",30Oct2017,1

42,"I have a dilemma. My son is autistic and has a case worker with the state dept of mental health. I am also spectrum and had been dating someone who is a caseworker in the same office. I met this person online. You will probably ask why did I keep dating this person if you read this. I was abused as a kid and have rarely been in a long term relationship that wasn't abusive. Abuse seems somewhat normal and keep in mind I am spectrum, so I don't usually date people who are just plain normal. 
The person I was dating after a few weeks said they had money problems, so they said if I couldn't help them they would have to find someone else to date. They suggested that one person they dated paid their house payment. I was a fool and liked this person so I did for about six months. At one point they kicked the door of the house where my son and I live. I had to make up and excuse to not worry him. Another time, I took this person on a really nice trip. At one point during the early evening, they started being mean to me and then started calling their friends telling them what an awful person I was. I am never violent, but I took the phone out of their hand and stuck it in the couch cushions. They went into a rage and threw wine bottles, a wine bucket, anything they could find at me and then began to hit me. Both of those times I could have had them arrested, but I didn't because I didn't want them to get in trouble. There were several other times where they were just mean to me. There were other times where I was dating someone really nice. I wonder if they had something mentally wrong with them since I felt I was dating two people. Not only did I give this person about $6000 at $1k a month, I did a lot of work on their home. I told them that I needed them to pay for some of those things and that I would only give $900 for the next few months. Keep in mind that they had regular contact with my son, a client of her office.
After about 8 months, they blocked me from their phone. I kind of lost it and I did text them about 16 times in a week and I used disposable numbers to get through. None of it was threatening with the exception that I did say that I would take them court to pay for the building supplies that I bought. They filed for a restraining order that they did drop, but will still not communicate with me to resolve some issues. I believed this person and believed that we were in a ""real"" relationship. I don't see how if someone was giving the other money, helping them non stop and being good to them, that 5 days of annoying text messages would end that relationship if it were real.
Today I learned that my son was being reassigned to a new caseworker. I want to make extra sure that he is in no way influenced by this abusive social worker. I am trying to decide whether I explain all that they did to me or not. I am spectrum and they knew it. They seemed to have taken advantage of me, abused me, spent time with my son, and then applied for a restraining order (which in my case would cause me to lose my job based on the work I do.) Shouldn't their office know that they took advantage of and abused a person with a mental challenge, especially when their job is to help people with mental difficulties?
Please let me know your thoughts. Should I report this person and ask that they be kept well away from my son and that he isn't assigned to any of their friends in the office? Thanks for your thoughts.",30Oct2017,2

48,"I'm a 21-year-old college student and I think I have severe anxiety. I've always struggled with an on-and-off eating disorder since middle school, and when I was 15/16 I was **SEVERELY DEPRESSED** to the point that I wrote a suicide note and had begun to self-harm. However, when my parents found that note I told them I was just venting, and they never ended up doing anything about it.

I kind of just suppressed those feelings. After a while I stopped feeling suicidal, and went on to do a lot of normal things. I've had boyfriends, gotten a job, joined a sorority, plan to study abroad next semester, etc. But now I am slammed with work. I have 15 credit hours, an internship, write for five magazines, am part of several clubs... it got to the point that I dropped the sorority and cut off about 90% of my friends (literally sending a text out of nowhere that I couldn't be friends with them, it was awful).

I have obsessive thoughts all day. Thoughts about my weight, that I'm not good enough for my major, that I have too busy of a schedule, that I need to do something rash like shave off all my hair or drop out of college.

Now it's getting scarier. For the first time in 5 years I'm having those suicidal thoughts. I'm not self-harming or anything, but I sometimes I get so anxious I am completely disassociated and want to do something like jump in the road. It happens maybe twice a day, but the obsessive thoughts are always there.

I have such a normal life and normal parents. I'm not in financial distress, and all the stress is good. Like, I'm stressed I have ten interviews set up for my campus's paper this week, or that my internship gave me extra responsibilities. But my first reaction is to hurt myself.

I'm afraid to get help. I don't think I could tell anyone I have these self-harm thoughts, but I think I have major anxiety (NOT social anxiety). I just need advice. Can I get help without my parents knowing? Do I HAVE to be put on medication? I don't know, I'm just scared that this is happening after 5 years of normalcy.

**tl;dr:** I used to be very depressed and suicidal for NO REASON as a teenager. After 5 years of normalcy (and never receiving help) those feelings are coming back. I have obsessive thoughts all day about either hurting myself or doing something rash like cut off all my friends or shave my hair. I am unsure what to do.

**EDIT:** I've also seen major changes to my mood. Sometimes I am both excited and depressed at the same time.

52,"PLEASE, DO NOT TALK ILL OF THE GIRL IN THIS POST! I AM IN NO WAY MAD, NOR DO I SEE ANYTHING SHE HAS DONE AS MELICIOUS. THIS IS SIMPLY ME VENTING MY THOUGHTS.

I am a guy with low self esteem and mental health issues. I especially have issues with women, to cut it short I have found that I am usually the replacement person for someone OR the guy they date until the one they want comes along. They always come back because they think they want a relationship with someone like me, but they don't, That's how I felt for a long time until I met this girl I'm seeing now. She is so freaking great, like I spend everyday feeling lucky to have her. She is funny, she can cook, she puts up with my nerdy weirdness and my social anxiety. She understands my mental illness and I can talk to her about anything. She is the first person to make me feel like she is proud of the fact she is dating me, like I feel that, to her at least, I mean something. I love her and she loves me, I know that 100%.

The issue is there is a slight age difference, just 5 years but still. We started dating when I was almost done university and she had just started. We were aquiantences and I had a massive crush on her but I thought she would think I was weird, turns out I was wrong and almost 3 years later we are going strong.
Lately though I have been feeling pretty low, I don't have a job and my girlfriend is living pretty far away(Considering we lived together for the majority of our relationship). I knew she was bi when we started dating, and I never really thought about it that much. Recently though she has been saying that it bothers her that she is in a monogomous relationship with a guy when she has feelings for both. She keeps reassuring me it's not a thing, that it was just her own mental health stuff getting to her. The other night though she was out with a friend and texted me asking if it was ok for them to make out. Now, with how low my self esteem is right now that just set me right off. She didn't do anything, and she said I told her it would be ok if she would fool around as long as it was a girl which honestly sounds like something I would have said before I started becoming more aware of different sexualities. She also says it's a different feeling with a girl, it's not even comparable to guys so there is not way a girl would replace me. Regardless she saw how much it bothered me and said that the topic is over and she won't bring it up again.

Now, I know her. If she really wanted to be with women and knew it would hurt me she would dump me, that's who she is. She is a strong woman that does what she wants. And I know that she loves and supports me and would never betray my trust, that's why she went and asked me before she did anything, she honestly thought I was going to be cool with it.

I guess what I'm really trying to say here, is that she is going to stay with me, and love me just as much as she ever had. But in my head, I know that she is thinking these things, and it's a side of herself and something that she wants that I cannot provide according to her.

55,"Hi everyone.  I've been in a state of sudden anxiety/crisis for the last two months and I guess I need to vent.

I'm a horrible person, let's just get that out of the way right now.  In the last year and a half I've cheated on my wife 5 times, by seeing a prostitute who would give me ""happy ending"" massages.  Our sex life was basically non-existent, and had been for most of our 10 year marriage, and I used this as a rationalization for doing it.  I'm a dirt bag, I know this.  I would leave work during the day and meet this woman in various 3-star hotels, and strangely I was able to fully compartmentalize what I was doing.  After seeing her I was able to go home to my wife and 3 kids and not even think about what I had done.  I chose what I thought to be ""safe"" activities by only getting massages and by choosing someone who was ""upscale.""

The last time I saw this woman was back in July.  This time, she invited me to touch her vagina, which I did.  Without getting to graphic, I made a point to not touch myself with that hand, but the whole experience left me feeling anxious.  I wasn't sure if she had touched herself before touching me.  Things happened quickly, and I wasn't 100% comfortable with it.

About 5 weeks after that visit, I developed a rash on my penis. As you can imagine, I started feeling major anxiety. It looked like a fungal infection to me, which I've had once before 13 years ago, and I went to a clinic and asked for an anti-fungal cream.  I did not disclose that I was afraid of an STD.  The rash cleared up rapidly and I thought that was the end of it.  Some irritation lingered, but I thought I just needed to continue the treatment.  

During this time, 6 weeks after that visit, my wife and I had sex once.

After about 2 weeks, when I was due to stop the medication, the irritation came back and never really went away.  Since then I tried various other medications, creams, powders, etc. Some made it worse, others had no effect.  My anxiety went through the roof.  I started waking up at night with my heart pounding so hard that it was shaking the bed.  I didn't look like any STD: it didn't spread, there were no bumps, no spots, no sores, no burning when I peed, it was just red and irritated.

After 2 more weeks of this, with my anxiety at a constant 8 or 9, I made an appointment with a dermatologist.  For some stupid reason, I did not tell her that I was concerned about an STD.  No one knew my secret and I just couldn't tell her.  She looked at it and said it was irritation caused by all of the medications I was using.  She also suggested that my apparent anxiety was making it worse, if not the root cause of it all.  I went home, only to notice tiny bumps on the bottom of my penis two days later. I went right back to the dermatologist and this time I tearfully told her the truth: that I was concerned that I had contracted an STD.  I showed the bumps to her, and she assured me that they were normal (They're called Fordyce spots, btw.) Then, she noticed a tiny speck, the size of a period at the end of a sentence, which she thought looked benign and not a genital wart, but she offered to freeze it off just in case.  She told me that if no other bumps appeared in 4 weeks, then it wasn't genital warts. I had her freeze it off, which in retrospect was stupid, because now I had a tiny wound to secretly care for on top of the initial irritation.  I felt like I was being smothered by my own lies.

My anxiety was now at about 9/10.  I'd had a constant a burning sensation in my penis for 5 weeks at this point. I was constantly checking my irritated penis for any sign of infection, and the antibiotic ointment needed for the post-freezing care was only irritating it further.  I was losing weight and waking up every night in a panic at about 2 or 3 am.  Any “compartmentalization” I had before fell apart. All I could think about was losing my wife and my children.  I was terrified that I had passed something on to my wife.  The shame and self-loathing and panic were almost too much to bear.  My thoughts were going to every horrible place imaginable.  I was having trouble concentrating at work and needed to get up and walk around the office park just to take the edge off of my anxiety. 

After a few weeks of this, I finally realized that my constant OCD checking for bumps and sores was actually causing irritation, because I was stretching and pulling at the skin so frequently (at least once per hour.)  So I made a determined effort to LEAVE IT ALONE.  Over a few days, things improved, but not completely.  

Then, out of nowhere, I started having new panic attacks.  The irritation started getting worse.  My nightmare fantasies started getting crazier, and so did the irritation.  It was as if my brain wouldn’t let me escape this hell and was finding new things to worry about.  The crescendo came this past weekend while we were out of town.  I seriously convinced myself that I had somehow contracted HIV.  I had been waking up with night sweats, and noticed sores in my mouth. (Thanks, WebMD!)  Then my wife casually showed me a rash on her abdomen, which I was sure was connected.  I was inwardly losing my mind, but keeping it together in front of my family.  When I was able to sneak away, I bought a rapid HIV test at a pharmacy and took it in a Home Depot parking lot.  It was negative, of course, but on some level I was certain that it would be positive, and I was visualizing every detail of the horrible fallout that would ensue.  I was starting to have plans to kill myself, but nixxed those when I thought about my wife and family.  After seeing the test result, I realized just how much of a grip this mental illness was having on me.

I just saw a General Practitioner today and relayed all of this to her. Her first words to me, after listening to me go on for several minutes, was ""You need to see a therapist.""  She also looked at my irritated member, and agreed with the dermatologist: she saw nothing wrong.  I had a blood drawn for a proper panel of STD tests, but at this point, 3 months after my encounter, I don't think anything is going to show up. She's also going to test for various infections and autoimmune problems, but I could tell that she was convinced that it was caused by my anxiety.  She referred me to a therapist and I made an appointment.  

So now, here I am, two months into this nightmare and no end in sight.  My penis is still raw and irritated constantly for no discernable reason.  The irritation wakes me up and then I go into horrible places in my mind.  Aside from the STD scare, I'm starting to wonder if this is just permanent thing: that I’m going to feel this burning sensation for the rest of my life.  This has killed my sex drive. I can't masturbate, every time I try it starts a cycle of irritation that lasts for days. I can't even remember what it felt like to not have this pain, and it's all I think about.  I don't take pleasure in anything anymore.  It's hard to play with my kids.  Around the house I avoid my wife out of shame.  I pace all the time because the constant pain has me on edge.  I'm not eating.

If this really is all in my head, how do I get out of this?

Thanks so much for reading, and feel free to tell me what a piece of shit I am.

**TLDR:** I cheated on my wife by getting a ""happy ending"" massage, have a rash on my penis that two doctors are telling me is psycho-somatic, and I'm losing my mind due to guilt and anxiety about this never going away.

I was with the girl of my dreams for a year, we were so perfect for each other it hurt, my problem was that I would always be angry or upset with her for the stupidest reason that even I thought were silly but I just couldn't help feeling that way, she eventually just stopped loving me like she used to and would never want to be with me sexually anymore.
It got so bad that she left me, now it's affecting my work and my boss is threatening to fire but he really doesn't want to because he likes me as a person.
When I wake up I just want to stay in bed and forget there's a world going on around me and when I finally do get up I have bouts of super negative thoughts and I hate myself. It's actually ruining my life and I can see my friends are growing more and more concerned for me. I'm not suicidal but I do often fantasize about never waking up again and having to deal with life. I quit smoking weed a few months ago to help with this but I'm only ever actually happy when I'm shit faced drunk. I go out and fuck girls on almost a weekly basis but it leaves me feeling worse, I kinda just want someone to love like my ex did.
I really don't want to resort to anti depressants but now I'm thinking that might be a good thing?

Any input would be greatly appreciated

Just to add; I'm extremely social and I work out a fair bit, I've even started eating well and taking care of my physical health but the feelings of depression are still there, especially when I'm on my own but also when I'm out with my friends (who are some amazingly loving people) ",30Oct2017,1
57,"My father left suddenly when I was 11. At the time it didn't really affect me much (or so I thought) because he was generally an asshole. But as an adult it's left me with very real abandonment issues.

My first serious relationship was difficult. For the first year I was clingy to the extreme. It put a massive strain on our relationship. Not getting the attention I ""needed"" from my partner at the time caused me very real distress and pain. We fought a lot, he really struggled to put up with me, but he did. And I eventually calmed down and realised he wasn't going anywhere. Unfortunately after nearly 8 years that relationship didn't work out and I met someone else.

I warned the new guy that I had been clingy in the past and he said he was okay with it. I was relieved and honestly thought now that I am older and wiser I wouldn't be  clingy again. I was wrong. I felt the same pain and distress when I wasn't getting what I needed from him and it ultimately pushed him too far and he broke up with me.

I've worked on myself for the past while we've been apart and I thought I was better, thought I'd figured it out. We've since started talking again and are maybe going to give it another shot. But I'm already feeling the pain of not getting enough attention. I hate saying it's attention I need, it's not. It's love and reassurance.

How can I work on this? The logic in me tells me he's not talking to me because he's busy. I know 99.9% that's what's going on. But that 0.1% is screaming that he doesn't care. I don't want to listen to it anymore. I want to talk to him about this but I haven't had a chance yet. I don't want to fuck this up again.",30Oct2017,2
58,"For as long as I can remember I've always been a insecure kid, I was always shy and kept more to myself.  Throughout the years I developed social anxiety, Social interaction scares me and tires me out and I cant really explain the feeling, I get really anxious and I'll scratch or hurt myself during conversations during the awkward silence moments which are completely normal in any given conversation which I can't explain to myself as I just did through text. Most of anxiety is because of the way i see myself. ""Oh I can't speak out I'll get it wrong and everyone will see me as the weird chubby girl who never talks"" or things like "" I can't wear that shirt or dress people will look at me and question why someone as ugly as me is trying so hard"". Things like this have bugged me for most of my life and I'm a Junior in High School and I'm embarrassed to be even writing this message. But if anyone has any advice pls msg me I'd really appreciate it.",30Oct2017,1
59,"I (f20) have had depression for a long time, along with social anxiety among other things like memory issues and I usually choose to stay in my dorm rather than go out. I feel like if I go outside, I'll just be a problem, like if I'm walking on the sidewalk, I'll move to walking on the grass so I'm not taking up space for other people to walk or walking too slow. I don't usually go to class and my grades are fine academically, because I feel like if I choose a place to sit, someone else will have to find a different place because I took up space. It's just a lot of insecurity that isn't rational regarding taking up other people's space and becoming a burden in their day, no matter how insignificant it is. I know it isn't healthy and please do not just comment something about how I just should get up and go out and meet people. I have tried.

 I don't have any hobbies or interests, I only talk when spoken to, I have no conversational skills. I have 2 close friends that I mostly talk to via snapchat or skype and that's about all of the contact I can take, and even then, I feel like I'm just bothering them by making them talk to me and that it's just out of pity, despite how many years they've stayed with me through my depression and shit. They can tell me they love me and care about me so much but I don't believe it. My friend said that he thinks I view myself as subhuman to everyone and everything else and that seems to be fitting. I have a supportive family and they love me and say I love you when I leave and I freeze and can't reply. I think I've maybe said it back twice in my life because I just can't feel it. Like I even deserve to be looked at, let alone loved.

 I have been single by choice for a few years and I started seeing someone a few months ago because I thought I was maybe okay and in my head, I had always dreamed that someone would be able to convince me that I'm not worthless and remind me that they like me and try to deal with my anxiety and depression so I could be somewhat normal and not sick. Well I started seeing this girl (18) and she is so extroverted and happy and likes to talk and go out with her friends and write poetry so I thought she could help me a little, not in the sense that I am using her only for that, but as a friend and to be supportive mutually and try to be happy. 

I'm passive so I never say what I actually want because I don't think it really matters and opposing people causes them problems and I don't want to do that or hurt their feelings or make them feel bad somehow. She's seen me cry and have a panic attack and has seen my injuries and everything but I still say I'm fine and that I'm okay afterwards so she doesn't feel like she was useless to helping me. 

My first panic attack with her was actually somewhat caused by her. She had told me she liked me and that she cared about me and wanted to help me and be honest and I started getting anxious and not replying because I froze up and I didn't know what to do? then she started asking if I was okay, what could she do for me, what did she do wrong, should she read to me, should she leave me alone, should she call someone, should she do whatever else and she was asking so many questions so fast about what she should do and I couldn’t answer because it was moving so fast in my head and I didn't know the answer I don’t know what I need or what helps me and I was just making problems for her because I had to get fucking anxious which made her feel bad that she couldn't help me and I had to keep reassuring her afterwards that she didn't do anything wrong and she was okay and I just felt like I was comforting her to cover up my own feelings. 

I always freeze up. She compliments me and I say no, she insists that it's true, and I look off somewhere else and don't say anything. I can't accept compliments because they feel fake and I don't know how to make my mouth form words and it just makes me so anxious inside. I mentioned subtly that I didn't think that I was comfortable being told things like that and she said okay. 

I've been trying so hard to not make her sad or disappointed or anything to the point where I just can't say no to anything because she'll pout and get all sad for the rest of the night and next day or however long it is until I break and just say okay, mostly regarding sex and the like. I am not comfortable with sex and I try to get out of it really subtly by changing subjects slowly or asking about assignments or plans she has but it always comes back. I still do what she says even if I hate it. I want to cry even thinking about doing anything like that because I feel wrong and like I'm back in high school and people are grabbing me and touching me and I'm just frozen there waiting to get paid with drugs for just sitting there and letting everyone take what they want from me and it hurts my chest and makes it hard to breathe and so I wait until she's sleeping and then I cry so she doesn't know about it. I mentioned that I'm not comfortable with sex or anything but she ignores it and pouts. It's just a cycle and I have tried to be assertive and say that it bothers me, but then she coincidentally forgets the conversation or tries to go at it while she's ""sleeping"" so she can get out of any responsibility while I'm saying no. I'm okay with letting myself be used but it's never felt like this. If I’m not as responsive to her telling me to compliment her or things like that, she says it’s because I’m in some kind of sub drop and she has to keep talking to me and not leave me alone because that’s how you fix it, but I don’t know if she’s saying that because it’s true or not. I figured if it was a drop, it would be temporary and even itself out, but this has been a feeling of dread in my chest for weeks.

She started telling me she loved me and I froze as usual. She said that it makes me upset and that she can tell and won't say it if I don't want her to and I said okay. But then she keeps saying it. Like hey I know it makes you upset but I love you, I love you, even if it upsets you, love you~, all of this, while acknowledging that it makes me so anxious and she doesn't stop even when I ask her to. I just feel wrong. I don't know how to process that someone loves me. It's like there's a signal but it gets blocked before I can interpret it or feel it. I feel like I'm broken and have no feelings and that maybe I'm sicker than I thought but then I realize that I must have feelings if I can feel depressed and anxious and sad and confused but I still feel wrong.

I like to be alone. For the summer, we’d text most of the night and skype for a while until one of us fell asleep and that was okay for me. I could handle it. When school started up again, she got really busy and didn’t talk to me much at all and I felt ignored but I didn’t really say anything about it because school is more important than my problems with affection. It went from her saying I needed to be scheduled into her week to even talk to her and that hurt. Now she’s suddenly extremely open on time and pushing off working on her assignments to try to talk to me at every given time of day. She calls on skype up to 5 times if I’m online, when I don’t answer, she’ll call my phone 5 times or so, then when I don’t pick up, she’ll send 20 texts and then messages on snapchat and Tumblr until I answer.

 I started with answering every call, they’d be an hour maybe, a few times a day, but we wouldn’t necessarily be talking. She’d be working on a paper or talking to friends, just with me on the background, and get all sad when I would hang up to go to the bathroom or work on something. Then it turned into a couple hours of calls every day, every day, then to calling at any time all day and not letting me hang up to go get dinner or work on assignments. It’s been a week straight of her calling as often as possible, not letting me leave, asking for sex via skype, demanding I compliment her, making me read things to her to make her sleep, making me have skype open while she plays a game on her computer even if I’m busy or have things to work on. I can’t call my 2 friends on skype because she’ll call while I’m trying to talk to them and keep calling. Then she’ll get sad and pout and ask why I talk to my other friends instead of her, and she tells me she hates them because they’re my friends, and I’ll just not argue because she knows I can’t talk back. Then she’ll ask for sex right after and guilt trip me.

I just can’t take this anymore. She always calls but I want to be alone and she just gets sad and guilt trips me about that too. I can’t take this much contact, I don’t know how to respond, I don’t know what will help me, I feel wrong, and I’m so anxious and depressed and trying to fix it so she isn’t mad at me. I think it’s all in my head and I’m making things more problematic then they actually are and that I’m just overreacting and I probably am, but I feel like she’s using my mental illnesses and taking advantage of my memory problems to benefit her and maybe she does actually love me but this all scares me.

tl:dr 

 I got the affection I dreamed about but this feels so wrong and like I’m walking down that creepy hallway in some horror movie to open this door while the audience is watching saying “oh my god why would you do that?” and I can just feel it but I’m not in control and I’m being pushed to the door and forced to endure whatever is there. I feel so weak. Is there something just wrong with me and having feelings and I’m not appreciating that someone actually likes me for once? Like, why am I so scared of her?

I'm also probably going to try to post this is some other threads for more input, I just don't know what to do",30Oct2017,2
