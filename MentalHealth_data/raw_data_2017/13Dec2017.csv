0,I went to the ER for depression and was prescribed effexor 37.5 mg and resperidone 0.5 mg for only 2 weeks. I dont have a psychiatrist currently. What do I do after 2 weeks?,13Dec2017,3,
1,"Long time lurker, first time posting here. Just thought I'd make a victory post because I'm feeling good about myself.

It's been so refreshing just to have clean feeling hair, lotioned skin, fresh socks. It leaves me wanting to do this more often, if only my energy level allowed it.",13Dec2017,23,

5,"Ill start by saying Im from the US, female and 20 years old. Like the title says, no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to find out why this happens. Im not sure if it's a problem with my brain but that seems like the most logical thing. Anyway, whats going on is something I've had for... I don't even know how long. Probably my whole teen years. Sometimes I will just clearly not or see things different than it is. And not like out of the corner of my eye type of thing. I could leave my glasses on a counter or my ring and because I remember putting them there I will look, stare for a little in bewilderment and keep looking, only to come back and it be in the exact spot I was looking. Its usually smaller things but sometimes I will just... not process that I see it? I don't know if thats what happening. It could be something wrong with my eyes, registering in my brain, or a mental illness. Now with the stuff I see differently. Its definitely not as a big deal as the other thing but I could read something (I'm not dyslexic, I read fine besides these random few times) I'll see different words. Again, not at a glance. I will read it a few times and see the wrong thing. Example, just now what triggered me to post this was it was this post saying ""find the car"" and I saw it as ""find the color"" I was confused because it was black and white. I read it over twice, looked for any detail of color then looked back down to see it said car, not color. This can sometimes happen with a few words and I'll have to read it multiple times because it makes no sense and sometimes it wont even be close to what it actually said. 
Now, I've always had an active imagination but that being a cause of this seems pretty unrealistic. Does anyone have information of this or suffer from it? Any information would be great! ",13Dec2017,3,

My wife is a very smart, beautiful, and talented person. However she thinks everyone is out to get her at her job. She tells me that the guy who coughs at her job is bullying her. She also starts getting horny at fidgeting/coughing. She's told me that she thought a lot of people at her job were lesbians and they were put to get her. She's told me that a lady bending over at her job was doing that to her on purpose because she was a lesbian.

She's had several jobs and she always winds up telling me that people were out to get her.

She doesn't want to go on meds and she thinks counseling is too expensive.

9,"It's a long story. It all started when I went to the doctor this summer.  At the doctors office I was given a form. On the form there was a question asking me about my mental status and if I thought I needed help. I ticked the box that said yes I think I need help.(which in  retrospect was a stupid thing to do)
 
The doctor came into the room I was waiting in with a concerned look on her face and behind her, a nurse that came along for  reasons unknown. The doctor started talking about depression believing that that was what I meant when I ticked the yes box. I was laughing the whole time and tried to explain that I was not depressed. However, the doctor kept arguing with me that she was right and I was depressed. The nurse just stood in the background of everything and was slowly and consistently nodding her head to everything the doctor said.

It all went downhill from there. My doctor had brought in my mother and started talking about my supposed problems. My mom was bawling and started talking to the doctor about how depression and bipolar disorder is in our family history (a lot of mental illnesses run in the family:major depressive,bipolar,GAD,OCD, and at the other end of the spectrum ASPD and NPD.) Trying to make a diagnoses based mostly on genetic predisposition would be hard. 

I tried to explain to my mother that I was not depressed, but she still believed all that the doctor told her. As soon as we got back home my parents made me give up all my devices( my computer was given back so I could do school work) , I had to be where my parents could see me at all times, and I can't be home by myself.

My Problem: 

I'm glad my parents care to try to help me even though they are helping me with the wrong problem. In a way they are making things worse for me. I hate people.I tried to find people like me on the internet, but none of them seem like me. A lot of them seem to have had a experience in their lives that made them that way, but nothing ever happened to me that I would say would change my views on humanity. I thought it might be teenage angst or something ,but I think everything started too early and has been going on for too many years. I always sucked up all my anger. I can still suck it up. At least I think I can. It hasn't gotten worse than when it first started so there's that. I'm not sure if all this anger is good for me. I someones presence just seems to make me mad. I'm not shy or anxious. I'm actually pretty calm.
I feel like any day I could crack.

Ever Since  I went to the doctor my doctor, everyone at her office, and my family don't believe me. They all write me off as depressed and believe anything else could be wrong with me or that nothing could be wrong with me at all. 

I'm sorry if that last section was vague and sounded kind of stupid I have to go do some school work right know and it's hard for me to explain everything in a short amount of time. If I were to explain the whole last part it probably would have been long and full of rants. It may have been better if I left it out.

11,"Hi! I could really use your help! So I have delayed sleep phase disorder and I moved into apartments in august. The noise makes it so I barely get any sleep. I just learned to accept that and told myself I'd look into moving options (I'm on HUD Housing, so it would be a while,) then in September on the 20th I had a meeting with my case worker. I didn't want the social workers who busted their butts into helping me move find out until I found somewhere else to move that the neighbors were loud. I told my case worker I didn't want them there and she ignored me and invited them anyway. One of them asked when I shared I want to move, "" are you just a light sleeper?"" Now I believe that everyone is obsessing over my sleep and I can't sleep cause I have ""performance anxiety."" I feel like people are thinking about my sleep all the time now. I cut off anyone who asks me about my sleep. I get anxious feeling like I'll never sleep again and I get panic attacks around bedtime. After months of  not a single restful night I'm losing my mind. And anytime someone asks me about my sleep it's confirmation in my mind that they're obsessing. I'm already insecure about my sleep and worry I won't sleep so having people ask about it exasperates the issue. If it's a stranger online I don't care but people close to me I obsess over what they think. It doesn't make any sense but I already have to CBT the hell out of my brain to sleep prior to people asking about it. Now I feel I'm on the spotlight. 

My case worker ruined my life. I asked to end services with this agency and she took a week to respond when she's suppose to take 48 hours. I cut myself while waiting I was so distressed because I thought I was being forced to work with this agency against my will. I needed to not work with them to detach from the comment. So I sought out my psychiatrist. And my therapist. Psych for meds, therapist to call my case worker so my case worker could see how the screening my calls was hurting me. My case worker took over a week to respond. She purposefully ignored my calls when I was suffering. My psych shared my notes with everyone in the psych department. All this could've been avoided if my case worker respected my wishes and didn't have the people at the meeting and respected my desire to not work them rather than taking a week to get back and questioning my reasoning. I'm 25 and I am the one who requested social services so she didn't have a right to do that. I relapsed into my anxiety and OCD. When I'm insecure about something, like sleep for example, being asked about it makes me believe someone is obsessing. I told my case worker multiple times I didn't want the social workers who busted their butts to help me move there. She ignored my wishes. 

I've since been seeking OCD therapists who do ERP and ACT, all don't accept insurance and are too expensive. I feel lost. I hate my case worker with every fiber I've my being and if it weren't for her none of this would've happened. ",13Dec2017,1,
12,"i’m a “singer” (i never really liked my voice but i have accepted commissions for the last several years because i have a hard time saying no) and now i have to live with how absolutely fucking terrible my voice is and has been over the last 4 years. the quality was shit, lyrics shit, poorly processed vocals, everything about it just makes me want to vomit. 

i cant delete them because they’re on the producers’ accounts, and they all have several thousand listens.  i haven’t talked to the producers in years so i’d feel uncomfortable reaching out and asking them to delete the songs.

13,"I don’t know which subreddit to post this in, not sure which illness this is.
When I was 4, we owned 3 dogs, a german shepherds and 2 Yorkies. One was called Beauty. At that point, my family life was good and happy. Somehow, I took on the identity of Beauty and said that “I’m Beauty”. Eventually, i started eating dog food from the bowl and forgot all language skills and only barked to communicate and slept on the floor. I couldn’t go to kindergarten because of this. My parents tried to persuade me to drop it, but it didn’t help. In a year, I grew out of it and regained my language skills and went to school at a normal age. So basically, I was a dog for a year of my life. Then my brother was born and said he loved cats. I was shocked, “how can you prefer cats?!” Then in a few years i also became a cat lover, and while i didn’t completely transition to a specific cat this time, i really desired to be a cat. Then i got a dog and was a dog lover for a year, but never had any ideas of “being a dog” more like “this dog is my child” but not in a literal way, more like how on insta girls call their pets “their babies”. Now its firmly back to cats and i really want to be one but im not doing anything weird this time. My parents are used to adressing me as cat/kitty on my request when they are in a good mood and sometimes i will meow to attract attention/or when i have nothing to say. I never got any help for this as a child or now, and im not interested in that. That part of my life is over. However, im a psychology student at school, and i want to make a project on this condition (without saying i had this). Can someone tell me what it is possibly called? Im just extremely curious, i love internet research and i want to know what it was that took a year of my life away and could it happen again? I heard about shizofrenia but shizofrenia seems to be more short term episodes? And i never had one since? Like no delusions hallucinations or anything. I know i probably sound like i need to be admitted to the hospital, but I’m fine, doing okay at school, and there never was any “voices” or desire to harm someone. If it helps for information im 17F and my father was abusive to my mother, they divorced and now she has a boyfriend but she is abusive to me. When she abuses me i think “if only i was a cat...” to help me cope with it, i don’t think I’m ACTUALLY a cat anymore, its more of a comfort thought.
More information: Self-dx anxiety+ADD+Social anxiety but all of this started after my mums abuse at 10 yrs old, not at the time of the dog thing.

22,"This is my first reddit post and I'm on my phone, so apologies if the formatting isn't great. 

I'm 22, and for as long as I can remember I've been deeply unhappy. It's up and down, I self harmed as a teenager and I was suicidal, but I definitely stabilised myself a lot as I got older. I have been horribly anxious about everything pretty consistently since I was very young, but I'm hesitant to actually say 'I have anxiety or depression' as I've never been to the doctor before, and don't feel at all qualified to self diagnose.

Recently - even though on paper I have a wonderful life - I've become numb and had suicidal idealisations again. I'm not going to kill myself,  but I think about it a lot. I realised today that my frame of mind is affecting my relationship and my quality of life, and that it's not something I can 'grow out of' or that will go away on its own, so I called my GP and made an appointment for this evening. 

I've never spoken to anybody in a professional environment about my mental health before, despite there being many times in which I probably should've done. As a teenager my (otherwise very supportive) parents told me repeatedly that mental health issues were just 'weakness' and that I was clearly fine - I didn't feel comfortable at all telling them how I felt and it's been something I've always been ashamed of. My partner knows I can be insecure and overthink, but he doesn't know the extent of it and I think he'd be horrified if he found out (he'd be upset I hadn't told him sooner). 

I'm going to my doctors appointment in two hours, to finally speak to somebody and get on the right track, but I am absolutely terrified that he won't believe me or he'll think I'm exaggerating/making it up. I'm not entirely sure what I'm expecting in response to this post, I just needed to tell somebody before I went and after spending a long time reading threads full of great advice and support I felt like I could post here.  

My partner knows about the appointment and that I'll call him after because it's something I think he should know about, but he has no idea what's wrong, and any advice on the best way to talk to him about it would also be super appreciated.

Some people go through so much emotional pain, they don’t know what to do. Cutting themselves gives them a sense of control, control over where,when, and why they feel pain. Maybe physical pain can help them forget about their emotional pain for even just a couple seconds. Anything to help them from going insane. Something that will let them escape their mind. Sometimes this person is the one that always has a smile on their face, or has their life all put together. It’s silent and not something people share. We all go through hard times, let’s help each other instead of bringing each other down. If you cut yourself people assume you are a bad person. But you’re not, you just need help, pray about it and ask God for strength, find someone you can trust and talk to them. You can find healing and peace through God.  #mental health ",13Dec2017,0,
36,"Hello, it's the first time I know of this subreddit, and it's kind of perfect because I need some advice.

So, my husband is going through depression because he doesn't like his job, and because this year will be the second year that he's unable to go to grad school to get his PhD. He graduated with his master's this past May, and he wanted to go into a PhD program right away (start this past august), but it wasn't possible. Due to this, he went through a rough patch during the summer. He didn't have a job, he didn't go to grad school, and he was feeling like he'd failed. I tried my best to cheer him up, to tell him that it wasn't the end of the world, and that shit happens and we have to deal with it, but I feel like a bitch because I get frustrated with him for not being able to ""handle"" rejection. Then, after he got a job, he was feeling the same because he didn’t like it, and he thought he wasn’t going to be able to excel at it.

Yesterday he found out that he, again, wasn’t going to be able to go into a PhD program, and he’s gone down again. He randomly bursts crying, like hardcore sobbing, saying that he’s a failure and that he feels stuck.

I should mention that he's had a very good life, he's very blessed. He's the youngest child, grew up kind of like an only child because his older brother is 17 years older, so by the time my husband was 5 years old, his brother had moved out of the house. His mom always gave him everything he needed, and they never struggled economically, or in any other aspect.

My theory is that he never learned to cope with rejection, or with things not going his way. And I don't know how to help him. He feels like he failed me, that he's supposed to ""give me a good life"", and that him not getting into a PhD program won't allow him to do so. I, of course, have told him a million times that I’m extremely proud of him, and that it isn’t the end of the world but, from what I see, I think that to him it is. I try my best to be supportive, and sometimes all I say is “I’m sorry. This sucks” and I let him get everything off his chest without saying anything, but I’m only human, and sometimes I reach a point in which I don’t know what else to tell him to make him feel better, or if I should just stop and let him resolve it on his own.

Has anybody else experienced something like this? I'd like input from both perspectives: the person who experienced it, and people whose loved ones have gone through something similar, though any thought will be greatly appreciated. Also, if this isn't the right subreddit, please guide me in the right direction.

I also have an expensive car payment because I don't have credit history and expensive insurance because I didn't get my license until I was 18. So I don't know necessarily how much help a sliding scale payment option would be for me. :/

I plan on seeing a mental health professional, but I don't know which kind I should see. If I tell all of this to my GP, are they able to refer me to the appropriate person?",13Dec2017,7,

I was looking for some advice from some other people in a similar situation. Officially, I've been diagnosed as manic depressive with anxiety since I was 16 (20 now), but the symptoms started somewhere around ages 12 or 13. That being said, I have discussed with a few professionals that I have had episodes of hearing voices, what I assume are hallucinations (with a level head I feel they clearly are but I've never been told if they could be or not) and severe paranoia.

I'm on Effexor for nearly 3 years now, and every few months my dosage has been upped. Whether this helps me or not, I can't honestly say as I go through periods of feeling completely fine (not in a great mood and thinking everything is amazing, just not feeling depressed) and then it's like a switch flips and I'm back to thinking suicidal thoughts, self harming and hearing and seeing things again.

Apart from being told to maybe seek out counselling with a local organisation, I've never been given much advice on how to deal with anything and move forward. I've gone to counselling in the past, but they were all pretty bad experiences and kind of put a bad taste in my mouth about doing it all again.

To be honest, I'm really not sure what I'm looking for here. Maybe just someone to understand what I'm going through? I have plenty of family to speak to about this but apart from the depression they don't seem to understand very much (and after some unfortunate reactions in the past I'm afraid some would want to have me committed if they heard about me hearing and seeing things).

I guess I'm just looking for reassurance that I'm not alone? That hopefully I might have my mental health under control? Or even what steps I should take moving forward in trying to help myself. I really don't know.

If you've read this far, cheers for putting up with that wall of text, and I suppose any advice would be beneficial and I'd be grateful. Thanks.",13Dec2017,1,
41,"I have depression and anxiety. I started taking antidepressants a couple of months ago and have started seeing a therapist, but every time I find something good in my life or it starts to take a turn for the better I do things to bring myself back to where I was. I'm starting to think that I enjoy being miserable and that I should just stay that way and stop trying to make my life better.

42,"I know I'm probably playing the victim, and complaining when I shouldn't.  Lately, certain events with certain people have made me rethink what love is.  Thankfully, they aren't always like this.  Maybe it's a stressful time.  Maybe I'm being spoiled...sometimes it feels invalidating and suffocating.  I realize now that love isn't continuously professing love, and asking whether you can come over.  It isn't doting on the other person.  Love is acknowledging the other person and taking a genuine interest in them. It isn't about wallowing in emotion, or making a grand example out of these emotions.  It's about the little things..the platonic things.. listening to what they have to say, letting them express their opinions, and letting them open up to you.  As much as I like love songs sometimes (I've got nothing against them)...whiny melodrama is not love.",13Dec2017,2,
43,"This term personality disorder baffles me. It came up in my group therapy session today. 

We discussed personality and what that means and it being a combination of traits and characteristics that are unique to that person. Some people in my group described personality as the essence of a person or their soul in other words. So it really baffled me to think about the term personality disorder. If personality is such a broad spectrum and can be made up of good and bad traits than how can they are necessarily be a disorder within that? 

The therapist running the session described personality disorders as being made up of three things. These were personality traits that were pervasive, persistent and problematic. He said that when you have one or a combination of these three traits within your personality, then you can be considered to have a personality disorder. 

What he said makes total sense, but it's still really confuses me. I understand that negative traits such as anger and narcissism are generally considered as being bad traits to have in a person, but how can you really say that someone's personality isn't how it should be? When do these traits become a disorder rather than just being quirks unique to that individual?  

I guess in a way it just makes me upset. In my mind I considered personality to be something that couldn't really be defined as being 'correct' one way or the other. I'd always assumed there's no right or wrong in personality, it's just unique to individual people. But obviously medical professionals disagree and they're saying that if you have problematic, pervasive or persistent bad personality traits you have a personality disorder. And I totally get that but something just won't click in my mind when it comes to this issue. I mean, I know I myself have very negative personality traits, but at the same time for someone to say that my personality is disordered really makes me upset, even though I am very aware that I do have problematic personality traits and that these are persistent over long periods of time. 

I don't know. I'm probably just chatting shit but I'd be really curious to hear other people's opinions on the term 'personality disorder' and what it means to them. 

I hope you're all having a fantastic day. Thank you for reading this. ❤",13Dec2017,2,

45,"So my girlfriend is, outwardly, very together and strong, she's intelligent, well liked, attractive (not outstandingly so but certainly well above average, at least to me) and fun.

47," Hi, I'm Kevin from New York. I'm in a class and for our final project we had to create a video based on health and well-being. I decided to tackle the issue of depression because it's something i've been dealing with for a while myself.
I wanted to create a video showcasing a sort of ""day in the life"" scenario of a teen who's dealing with depression, yet no one in his life really seems to notice. I wanted to show that depression comes in many forms, and give an example of one in my video.
A lot of the video has to deal with personal experiences, and I just wanted to share in case there are others who might have similar experiences, of trying their best to be functional in society, yet find it difficult to find their voice, or rather ear that will listen to them when they need so.

I’m 22 year old female with really bad social anxiety, I’ve been suffering with this since I was young. My family always told me I was a very scared kid and recently fell upon this mental health group in Toronto where people who have anxiety or suffer with social anxiety go to. I really want to join but I’m a bit embarrassed and I’m afraid of who il see there, I’m scared that my social anxiety is on another level from the others that attend.

51,"Finally gona go see a doctor and try my best to put into words what's going on in my mind, I think writing it out somewhere like here might help a little. So my whole life something has been kind of ""off"" with me, I was diagnosed with Dyspraxia as a kid, so I always assumed it was that but I don't think it covers everything I struggle with. I've always had self esteem issues which were made worse by an emotionally abusive relationship when I was in high school, so I struggled a lot at college but I was still growing up and just stuck with it because I felt like I had to go. Finding out I had the freedom to do what I wanted as an adult was kind of a death sentence because this is where most of my problems lie. I got to University and really started to think about the fact that I didn't have to be here if I didn't want to. I was really struggling with making friends there and wasn't really enjoying the course, so I dropped out to go try an apprenticeship instead. The problem is, now I know that there's no specific one path for me, I can't stick to anything. I really think this is an OCD or ADHD thing, but I'm not really sure. When I try to stick to a job, hobby or relationship, I always have constant intrusive thoughts about whether or not its right for me, thinking about whether there's something better out there that I could be doing. Every day I get these thoughts that I try to ignore, and it makes me so exhausted that I end up struggling at work, having time off and getting the sack anyway. I feel like I'm a prisoner to my own mind, and whatever it wants to do it will eat away at my logic and eventually take over causing me to self sabotage anything I try. I'm now stuck in a constant analysis paralysis state, because whatever I think about doing all the possible outcomes fly into my head, usually the negative ones. I can't just go with the flow with anything, my mind seems to go into overdrive and overthink everything in an instant. I'm really struggling with sleep at the moment as well as whenever I get into bed I seem to get really anxious, a few years ago I started having pretty nasty night terrors that cause me to run out of my bedroom in fear as if something is chasing me, before I eventually snap out of it and realise nothing is after me and not knowing what I was running from in the first place. I've also started having strange hallucinations when I try to sleep now, just as I'm drifiting off I will get incredibly vivid images in my head that can be very disturbing, or I will hear a voice say something which jolts me up in fear. I end up having to spend hours just trying to fall asleep, and have to try to calm myself down with music so I end up exhausted every single day from the lack of sleep. I feel completely stuck because of my own brain and I'm not really sure what to do about it. There's a lot more, such as the fact that I'm incredibly disorganised and live in a pretty messy room which stresses me out aswell, and the fact that I seemingly have no motivation to do anything at all, but I know I'm not just ""lazy"" because I'm constantly thinking about what I can do to better myself, I just can't seem to take action with any of it. Thanks for reading my ramble, I'm not asking for any kind of diagnosis, just felt like I needed to vent this somewhere. ",13Dec2017,3,
52,"Ah, where to begin?

Well, as the title suggests, I am a complete joke of a human being. I’m turning 23 in a couple weeks and my biggest kept secret, aka my extremely poor mental health, is and has been making me do things that are completely ruining what would otherwise be a good life and it is just getting to be too much.

Basically, I dropped out of college after my second year because the work was giving me anxiety and I just doubted that I could ever make it in my prospective career path. I have since been working (scarcely) in the food industry and I absolutely feel like I can’t deal with it. In the past year alone, I have been through 5 jobs with the longest lasting only a couple months and only one of them have I actually put in 2 weeks notice. The others I either quit by email or, in terms of my most recent job, just stopped coming in and ignored all calls and voicemails from them. I’ve always been miserable at these jobs and dealing with customers and the idea that I might screw up or I’m not working fast enough always gave me ridiculous amounts of anxiety before going in to the point where I convinced myself that the company would be much better off without me. I currently live with my mother, who reminds me on a daily basis how much of a failure I am. When I try to talk to her about my anxiety and depression, and getting possible professional help for my recurring suicidal thoughts, she doesn’t want to hear of it and tells me I need to make more goals for myself. I do try to make goals. I just have a hard time fulfilling them.

I’ve always been kind of secretive and afraid to tell people about myself out of fear that they won’t accept me or will judge me, so in the past I have often developed friendships or romantic relationships with selfish or narcissistic people. I did this because I felt it was a win-win for everyone. I didn’t mind listening to their problems, always being there when they needed me, doing favors and supporting them, basically putting them before myself. It actually made me feel helpful and important, I felt like I was their rock, and they would never ask about me, which made me feel safe. As I got older, I realized how much these relationships were draining me and how unhealthy they were. So I stopped hanging around these type of people, which in turn, turned me into a bit of a loner. Now I have trouble getting into normal relationships with people, as I lack trust and the will to open up to people. I’d really love to start making healthy relationships and there are people in my life who would like the same with me, but I feel like at times I push them away out of fear. I’m so scared to put myself out there in terms of friendships/relationships. I also really miss having a romantic partner, but I don’t even try to date. Even guys who are interested, I push away because I feel like I’m such a mess. I also feel like any rejection will destroy me.

My mental health has been poor for about the past decade. I had attempted suicide when I was 15 and ended up in a psych ward for a while. I didn’t feel like the required therapy was helpful, but then again I wasn’t exactly honest with my therapists. I didn’t open up or tell them what I was really thinking because I was worried they would share everything with my mom because I was a minor, and she was already embarrassed enough with the whole ordeal so it was just too shameful. But anyway, for the past couple weeks I’ve been feeling really low. Walked out on a job, won’t answer messages from people that care about me, live off a diet of wine, coffee, and pastries, barely have energy to do anything besides lay in bed and think about how much I hate myself and how much of a disappointment I am. My suicidal thoughts have been coming back strong, and although I really want to get better, I just don’t know what to do anymore. My last option would be to try seeing a professional again. Even with insurance it is very expensive. I have a total savings of about $3,000 and not many bills to pay, so I was thinking of using it towards therapy and hopefully that will help. Otherwise, I don’t know. I don’t want to die, I really want to get better and I know I don’t have much against me except for my own mind, but I’m just in a really bad place. There are people that care about me, but if I keep up whatever I’m doing, I worry that they won’t be there much longer. I just don’t know what to do anymore.",13Dec2017,4,
53,"When I was a teenager I used to take my anger out on walls. Usually, I would just keep punching until I can see my own blood. After I would see my knuckles scarred and bleeding, I would immediately feel better and calm down. A few months later my arms and wrists started to ache. The idea of sticking knives in them started to feel really appealing, almost pleasurable. I held off doing it until I was 27. I stopped pretty quickly after I realized the scars were staying on my arm. Just putting a knife near my arm drives me crazy. I'm not suicidal or looking for attention. I just really really want to cut myself. Just typing this out or mentioning it is making it worse. I can barely type my arms and wrists feel achy like they're on fire. Is there a way to sate my craving for self-mutilation without leaving scars. Or get what I need without self-harming, if possible.

58,"Hi! Sorry for the text wall.

I'm a foreign grad student in Japan and I was supposed to be living the dream. I feel so stuck. I can't get anything done. Getting out of my bed has never been harder. I can't help but skip class some days. It just feels so overwhelming. I don't know what's going on.

I had some panic attacks last year, but I've learnt to control them and it's been a very long time since my last one. I just feel so tired, like I was carrying the whole world on my back. My eyes feel   so sleepy and kinda itchy. To get anything done I need to build up so much anxiety, that I need to rest for a day after deadlines. During those days I also need to go to the toilet very often.

I feel so embarrassed for my performance. I never thought I would end up like this as I was always the best student during my whole life. I don't wanna give up as I know I would blame myself for the rest of my life.

When I'm at home, I just freak out and have every negative thought possible. I don't feel suicidal but I wish didn't exist.
Is there anybody feeling something similar? What could it be?
I don't know what to do anymore...

59,"I understand my faults. I know I tend to beat myself up. I am afraid of being intellectually incoherent or impossible to point or pretentious with an individualistic point of view. Hell this whole post feel like a narcissistic approach to resolving my issues. But I have questions and I am not sure where else to ask or apply them to.

* I am an ENFP. If anyone cares to believe in mbti type descriptions. I know its not entirely accurate and I understand personalities can change. But it seems scarily accurate to my approach to life. My elder sister and I were raised in an abusive environment. Her being an ISTJ had told me that family is everything, she follows tradition, she looks at things thinking that if people did it her way then there would be no issues. I don't think like that. I understand her mentality. She comes from being the older one and had to deal with a lot of responsibility. She had to learn how to confront issues quickly and learn fast from the difficulties of growing up a little too quick. See we both have a lot of childlike qualities probably from the lack of a childhood. Having a mentally and physically abusive grandparent who guilted us about our existence and parents who abandoned us when we were young. Self esteem was never a strong point for me. That is until I got older and learned to embrace myself in my entirety and appreciate my unorthodox approaches to life. Or just how I view things. See I try to be objective and reasonable. I know we are in a movement of liberalism, womens rights and so on and so forth. It pains me when I hear women (mainly due to my own experiences with women which I am aware of) talk about how men are trash. And those ""niceguy"" white knights say not all men. And I understand the movement and the concept. But its a generalization that frustrates me to the very core. Similarly the same with sensitivity and effeminatenes. Which are my own perceptions of course but I feel like its shamed and looked down upon. And I understand that any gender and people or culture can have their downtrodden issues and problems. Which makes complaining about the circumstance even more of an issue. And trying to be constantly objective and aware of my own fallacies and mistakes. I know I am not perfect. I just live on a fence of analysis paralysis. I have liberal friends who dictate coddling and hypersensitivities and entitlement. But I have conservative friends who think tradition is the only way and are too stubborn or absolute in their observations and opinions of others and life that they think thats how things are. That progress was not happening. Even in small increments.

* See I took that lack of childhood and turned it into this childlike wonder. Possibility, potential, hope... Especially in this day and age where I feel this sense of jadedness from my current age of being in my late 20s and severely unsatisfied with my life. I don't want to lose that childlikeness. Even if its cliche and people makes memes of cheesiness and how overdone and archaic it can be. Especially being surrounded by sarcasm and nihilism. And I try to respect those opinions but at the same time personally I need that reason.

* That existential nihilism in a sense. Of having some value. Some imaginary potential. Which I know wont happen just sitting on my ass either. And i try and of course I have made some accomplishments. But lately I feel fruitless in my endeavors. I always wanted to free this expression in my soul but I just get stuck in the fear and details and what is expected and what is authentic and sincere. Trusting myself to trust in general. 

* I think my feelings are dumb. I think the whole woe as me concept is done. But at the same time I feel this sense of inner specialness. Even if its fake to feel like I was ment for something more. And not with religious connotations. But changing things. Expression. Creating things. One of the most beautiful things to me. Is that feeling of connection and interpretation. How lack of context can create stories. How we can feel certain things that people say or word out in our own minds as if we say them ourselves. 

* I feel like some of the most impactful experiences from peoples lives. What shapes them is Art. And experiences in creativity. We can tell stories. We can write about a moment in paragraphs. Words can create context for mere moments. We slow down time with our ideas and stories. With our imagination. A lot of people i know are influenced by their favorite films or favorite video games or pop culture references. Writers, musicians, so on and so forth....

* Sorry I am rambling. I just don't know what to do... I don't have reliable transportation to therapy... And at the same time i have the lowest cheapest medical I could qualify for. A lot of the time therapy seems insincere. That compassion is a business. That its a structure of what is right and wrong with no ambiguity. Especially with how the world works. Life obviously isnt good and bad. At least in my perspective. Hitler never thought he was a villian. And I am sure I don't have all the full context or information but that is why I am here. Asking out to all of you.
I just feel like therapy feels fake or obligation. Maybe because I dont have any support system that was developed over the years of knowing them and feeling like that most people would have enough rapport to have that kind of support and relationship.

* I am just stating opinions of course. Please dont bite my head. I dont claim that all people suck and I hate my life and what not. I understand my life isnt the way I want it and I have the power to change that. I understand its a process. But I think the stress and insanity comes from the devaluing I get from expressing my hopefully, optimistic, and cheery disposition. I know life isn't sunshine and rainbows. I lived through mental and physical abuse that isn't normal. (i.e.: If I didn't cut my nails, she would try to shove nail polish down my throat. Or the fact that my parents are vagrants and irresponsible and that mental shame and guilt from knowing ""if we didnt have to take care of you we would have more money."" Or things 7 year old children shouldnt see or hear such as my mom ""being a whore for drugs"" And these dark realities. Of course I want optimism. I understand it can annoy and be stupid. But I try to be mindful and understanding of the fact that most people wont appreciate or understand or discuss in depth about things when they don't have enough context. We are afraid of what we dont understand, people all have a different life than your own, yadda yadda, cliche after cliche. I understand these things... Which is why complaining about it or talking about it shames me and this is a throwaway.

* If it isnt obvious I have C-PTSD and Severe Major Depression. I don't have any real support systems and I know that is due to my own fears and insecurities involving trust and what I rationalize as the reason which is that rapport isnt as deep or understanding or trusting.

* I am already working on what I can do and I seek therapy and I do take medication (antidepressants) But therapy is difficult to reach as well as having someone to talk to or non biased non judgemental support. I've attempted suicide many times. Some out of attention, some out of tantrums, and some out of cowardice from not wanting to deal with my reality. Now I don't feel at all. Not in the same way. The only feeling that permeates everything is fear...

* Fear to share my opinions, fear to express, fear to be me, fear to share myself or my emotions or desires. And shame. Shame about having any emotion at all. I know I am self critical. I know that I can have hypersensitivities and I shouldn't act like that because its obviously not respectable or attractive. In fact it ruins your credibility. Showing emotion in my experience makes people devalue my opinions or intelligence. I may be a feeler but I still have some intellect. I have passions and interests and love complexity and depth. I have a very expansive observative point of view when it comes to the world around me. I try to do my research. I try to look past the rose tinted lenses and see things in their beauty and danger. I love mythos and storytelling and world building and how a lack of context creates wonderful driven narratives. I love game design and the design standpoint of how a designer looks at the game compared to a player. And putting that perspective and spin on how a player will react or adapt or take in their environment. Showing the way indirectly or developing concepts that are easily translatable and easy to convey and share. Idk... I am a graphic designer but I work at a marketing job doing the same repetitive tasks of calling people for money or fixing coding issues with websites... I know I have time to change my life but right now especially in my circumstance of experience and environment I feel like my mental state is dwindling or not conducive to my growth as a person... The issue here is I dont know how to get the support I need without feeling ashamed or judged or having issues with explaining my position. (Which I am sure is a mess to read through her with constant tangents and running in these loops of mental issues...) But the whole thing goes to how dumb I feel for having mental issues and how it effects my life in a very intrusive way and how it devalues me as a person when I know I have the potential to do more or be more. Especially coming from the fact that I was stable, reliable, and in control at one point....

**TL;DR - You have to actually read it sorry. I know that may be offputting to some people but without context decisions and judgements will only be seen through a half open window... Not to be overly histrionic or dramatic... which I am sure sounds this way now... I forgot to mention that therapy and getting to it is difficult let alone the fact that I need to plan appointments within a couple month intervals. Like my current therapist and psychiatrist. I have two apointments. One in January, and one in February. This also contributes to the shame and devaluing of my personal traumas and experiences and makes me ashamed to admit PTSD as if its some dramatic story...**

**Furthermore... I am not looking for some kind of external validation of pity but I don't want to be attacked for it either. I don't want to be narcissistic and I don't like being self centered. I guess I am just putting what I can out here hoping for answers or support. As obvious as it is I am extremely self critical. I don't need to be told to seek help or whatever. That is a process I am doing and dealing with right now. The fear comes from the lonelines of doing it by myself like I am a flawed misshaped creature who cant be taken seriously or sincerely due to being overly sentimental, optimistic, or emotional. Being ostracized like you need to be fixed doesn't encourage self respect.**",13Dec2017,8,
