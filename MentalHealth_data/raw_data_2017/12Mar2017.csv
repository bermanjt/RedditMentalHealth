1,"I am a 27 year old female, and for as long as I can remember, have had strong urges and fantasies of torturing someone in extreme ways and eventually killing them. This is not something that pops into my head as an intrusive thought, nor is it something that develops in anger or rage. These feelings are usually pleasureful and sexual in nature. I find myself enjoying the suffering of almost everyone around me, but particularly when it is physical. I have seen major accidents and witnessed violence in person and felt a sense of excitement and endorphins released from imagining inflicting the pain myself. 

I am not bothered by the fact that I have these thoughts, but it has been frustrating me lately because I have no way to act them out without ruining my life. I have a good marriage and career and generally like my life, so I see it as important not to take any risks that could destroy everything I have worked for. I also understand that I am likely to be harmed or killed in the process and would never get away with it. 

In the last year, I decided to kill a stray cat just to have the experience of killing something. I lured it with drugged food, bound its legs, and stabbed it in the side of the stomach with a kitchen knife. There was definitely some thrill in the action, but overall not as exciting as I hoped considering the mess and clean up. I do think it would be far more exciting with a person as humans are more understanding of their situation and able to react in more interesting ways. Plus, there is simply more challenge in it. 

I always felt that I could stick to just fantasy and keep these thoughts seperate from my daily life, but my obsession with them is starting to become too much and I feel like I may say or do something stupid at some point. 

How can I find a new healthier outlet for this fetish? 

TL;DR I have strong sadistic fantasies and obsessions with torture and murder and I need a healthy outlet for them that does not ruin my life. ",12Mar2017,2,

6,"I've been depressed most of my life and have only started feeling better in recent years. Then I start BC because I find out I have PCOS and ever since I've been miserable. I cry at the drop of a dime, I'm pushing people away from me, I snap easily, more anxiety, and just all around awful. I'm not sure what to do. Would depression medication help? Do you think my recent depression is connected to me taking BC? I heard it can cause both depression and anxiety, and both started around the time I began taking BC.
I have to keep taking BC because of my condition but I'm so miserable. I'm having serious suicidal thoughts again. Is there anything that can even be done? Like a different BC? Or am I stuck this way?",12Mar2017,2,

9,"I just moved to Canada (NT) a few months ago. I can handle things, but, I don't know until when. It took me years to finally reach this point, and even now, I'm still not sure if I should still pursue to get help. And since I just arrived in Canada, I have no idea how stuff work, particularly the healthcare system. 

My first question is where to start. My problem is I have no idea what my problem is. The local resources I see thru pamphlets are for addiction and suicide, I think my problem is neither since I never do drugs or take anything excessively, nor do I plan killing myself that much. I don't know who to talk to. I don't even feel comfortable talking to my parents about it, and they're the only people actually talk to. Where should I go? I'm doing this as discreet as possible so I don't make my parents worried of me. But if I can't, well, that's still okay.

My second question is about the cost. Does the initial thing cost something?

My third question is does it always have something to do with therapy with talking stuff. I don't really talk much. (Which could also be one of my problems, though.) One thing stopping from pursuing help is just me avoiding to talk to other people. But Canadians sure do talk, it's scares me. (But I can still somewhat cope)

My fourth question is should I get help. I've been thinking about this for months. I thought of the costs, my parents getting worried, me exaggerating things, the pretentiousness of me being new in Canadaâ€¦ Then I thought of me struggling with school projects that require interaction, interaction with anyone at all, or pursuing myself to get out of bed and do general things everyday. I think I'm just lazy, shy, and I lack self-discipline. Another thing that pushed me to try to get help is my mom always getting worried of me of forgetting things (and she sometimes notices I just idle unusually). She even had nightmares telling me to not forget going home. I think I'm exaggerating, sometimes not. But then again, I'm able to cope with these things all these years. But they say: (if I get help,) everything  is going to be as clear as night and day. It's just a dilemma. Should I get help?

TL;DR:
New to everything in Canada, where to get help in NT, Canada?
How much does those stuff cost?
Do I need to talk in a group?
Should I get help?

Thank you so much if you've read everything, knowing someone out there read this could enough get me through this day. (Yay! I got the the guts to post these things)

11,"He rarely drinks, but smokes marijuana daily. He is wise and educated. He was new to lsd and he took two tablets last Sunday and before that he was taking a tablet once every two to three days. He took a total of 6 since his first time. Anyways. His last time was Last Sunday (2 hits) (a week ago). He has schizophrenia, but he hasn't needed meds. He was doing well for years with little issue. Now that he has the acid..he is having delusions. Half the time, he thinks people are going to kill him or people that he love. The other time he thinks happily or he's just himself. He was admitted to the ward last night, I called them. They are giving him some sort of medicine and I am not quite sure what it is. I feel I know they're going to keep him until Thursday. I don't want him to flip out because he thinks he's going to get out Monday. He has been doing better, but not quite to the point where he's back to himself. I don't know what to do to help him. I am nervous that he's going to flip out on Monday when he finds out that he can't get out until Wednesday or Thursday. He is a very smart and wise man. He only took the acid to try to gain more enlightenment. He does not trust anyone, but me. He will be able to see through what the psychiatrists are trying to get at. That is a huge trigger for him, because he sees why they ask him certain questions and what they are trying to do. I don't know what to do, I fear he will flip out if he knows he has to stay longer and then he really will stay a while and be depressed or something. He is not going to take the medication when he leaves, so I just don't know what to do with all of this. Maybe the LSD will wear off? He has just in the last three days gotten a normal amount of sleep, before that, it was 3 hours of sleep. Thank you.",12Mar2017,3,
12,"So I've been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type... and I take meds to help alleviate the symptoms... but I've noticed that sometimes more often than not if I don't take my meds at the right time or even if I do, I can't fall asleep. I will literally be up all night until the morning comes around again and not feel tired at all! Sometimes it's my mind racing and paranoid thoughts that keep me up, other times I'm simply not tired and can run off of very little sleep. I have been prescribed things like trazodone (which stopped working for me) then Benedryl... now I have ambien but I refuse to take it because I've heard that people abuse it and I have problems with substance abuse... point is anyone else have this problem?

13,"The fact that I'm still a teenager(14 yrs old and a girl) makes it more daunting. I've always sense alienation from my peers and people, in general, since I was little. Social interaction, for me, is a convoluted task that gradually becomes easier the more attempts I make at it... except I don't even try. Sure, I can read people's facial expressions and interpret subtle tone changes to a certain extent. But I'm easily tired and stranded in a maze of extreme confusion and paranoia that I can only escape once the convo has ceased. Group talk strains me more than one-on-one talk.  

Even worse, most of my peers whom I seldom converse with consider me ""naive"" or ""too nice and shy."" They praise my high academics but think that I let people mess with me too much. It's just that I strive to be the most uplifting person I can, which can be interpreted as weakness by some. I also like to tease people and laugh at their mistakes a lot, and they treat me as a little kid for that. But I embrace being ""adorkable."" I'm basically the awkward nerd/geek at school.

My bedroom is referred to as my fortress of solitude. It's where I can rejoice in freedom and indulge my special interests. I've gone from codes to religion to art to languages and now wars. They're the only things that provide me relief from this dull lifestyle. I would rock back and forth researching such arbitrary facts only to notice that I haven't eaten in more than twelve hours.

19,"26-year-old trans woman living in California

I don't have any questions but I just thought it would be helpful to write down what I'm going through in a space where people going through similar situations may see it.

Last year my wife left me because she realized she was a lesbian. This happened only a few months after I started realizing I was transgender. Her leaving me even though I was planning on transitioning still makes sense for a variety of reasons but I find it very confusing and distressing. I was often depressed before she left me, especially for the last year, but I was able to function mostly normally because I leaned heavily on her to give me direction and purpose. I was never a whole person by myself. But now that she's gone, everything is so empty.

I spend the vast majority of my time in bed. I've set some minimum requirements for myself that I've mostly managed to keep to: eat three meals a day, drink water, go to martial arts twice a week, go spend time with friends at least a couple times a week, keep the house mostly clean. I still manage to meet all my expectations at work, but honestly I work from home and nap most of the day. At night I usually stay up until somewhere between 2am and 5am watching Netflix. The rest of the day I lay in bed doing nothing on my phone for hours, desperately thinking about how I need to get out of bed and do something specific but never being able to find the will to do it. My brain feels numb and unfocused all the time. Disassociating has always been my chief coping mechanism but it's never felt as tangible as it does now. I'm constantly sleepy. I've committed to trying to get at least a straight 7 hours of sleep every night but my success has been mixed. 

I started seeing a therapist and he put me on Lexapro and Wellbutrin. The drugs helped me stop having suicidal ideation (which I've had most of my life), helped me stop getting trapped in cycles of negative thoughts, and helped me regain a little bit of a feeling of purpose at my job. But the therapist is honestly a mess. He refuses to believe anything other than the fact that everything I'm going through is a grief response to the divorce. Maybe because I never really sought therapy before. I told him I'm worried about ADHD, OCD, Bipolar or Depressive, Autism Spectrum, which he pretty much ignored. Every time I go see him it's always ""how do you feel about your parents"" or ""I think last time we discussed that you were having trouble sleeping, how's that going?"" When I see him I can never find the words to express what's wrong, probably because making myself vulnerable like that triggers a big dose of disassociation. He's useless. I haven't told him about my gender identity issues because I don't really feel any trust towards him and it's a very vulnerable thing to talk about. I'm on a waiting list for a therapist who specializes in gender identity and seems like she will be a better fit, but it's been two months on that waiting list. All the therapists under my insurance that aren't shit are impossible to get appointments with.

I miss my ex-wife. We talked about needing space and only spending time together in groups for a while, even though we want to stay friends. Still, even under those constraints I really feel her pulling away from me. She's implied to me that she's having a harder time getting over me than she expected and she needs to be more distant than she expected because of that. I understand, but I miss my best friend so much. And I'm still not a whole person, but without someone to dump all my issues on I'm just a mess.

Edit: I should also add that the only time I feel completely present is when I'm working on my transition. Doing research, shopping online for girl clothes, working on growing my hair out, learning make-up. I guess it's pretty much what I currently live for.",12Mar2017,1,

22,"I feel very stuck. 

My brother and I are 3 years apart (him older, me younger) and we had a sort of close relationship- or so my parents could call it that. 
Being the youngest, of course I endured the normal experience of sibling rivalries and constant bickering towards each other. It's normal and I guess somewhat healthy. 
And I had days where we could be civil and play together and actually agree on what movie to watch with dinner. 
But things changed as we grew up. 
I was 10 and he was 13. I was still little enough to be playing with barbies and have a flat chest, but he was struggling with a new environment (highscool), friendships, and that magical package deal of teen hood; puberty and hormones.
Unfortunately, despite my young age, I was physically developing; my hips grew wider, my butt got bigger, and my chest began to bud. 
He noticed. In fact, he was the one that pointed it out before I did. I didn't know what was happening to me, nor did it really bother me. But for some reason, it affected him? I don't know. But suddenly, after a while, he began to do a little more than just hug me, and he hugged me a lot as far as older brothers go. He would sniff me and say I smelt beautiful, and would sort of gush over my 'curves'. I did not feel comfortable and something told me that this was not right, but I didn't understand. And I thought; 'okay, he's older, he knows what's what,' and I trusted him. So I ignored the strings of my doubt and went along with it. He called it Special Hug.

More and more happened each time. And it was like I had no privacy anymore. He wouldn't knock; he didn't see a problem with waking in on me changing or taking a shower. And when we were infants, it wasn't a problem, so I thought it was okay. 
This went on for almost a year, and it didn't stop until the end of 2008. 

During the time, I started to speak my thoughts and I asked him about it a couple times. He would respond with; 'it's okay, we're not really doing anything,' or just 'it's okay and I love you,' 

Really bitch?! Really?!?! 

After while, my doubts kept creeping up on me and made me feel very uncomfortable to point where it would upset and frustrate me a great deal. I wasn't into it and surely anyone would half a brain would have seen that, it was almost as if he didn't care about how I felt, he was just concerned about what he wanted. 

Fucking prick.

When I actually built up the courage to tell him that I didn't want to anymore (not that I ever really did) he would put on this really sad face and hang his head slightly and go; 'oh, okay,' and mope, leaving me to feel guilty and absolutely miserable. Why? Because I did love and look up to my brother and I despite this, I didn't want to lose him. So I caved, and this kept happening each time I tried to stop it. 
It tore me up inside. I was so young, too young. 

What horrible thing does a child -boy or girl- do to deserve this? What could I have possibly have done to deserve any of it? This stuff doesn't leave you. It's dangled like a wind chime in your head forever, even if you stuffed that memory right at the back of your mind, you can still hear its whisper. 

My mum caught him once jabbing me way too much and in certain parts of my body that weren't appropriate, and gave him a big lecture about it, which made him burst into tears and said; 'is that what you think I am? A pervert?' 

Honestly, I snicker at that. I really wish that I could just punch him in the face, I really do. 

After that, it didn't continue. Not that it mattered, the mental scars remain as if it never stopped. And I hate it. 

In all honesty, I do not feel that I can give this the full blame to why I am so messed up inside completely. My self esteem was low, I have high anxiety and I don't feel comfortable with romantic relationships. 
I was bullied for two years and had no friends in that same time period (2008 &amp; 2009) and I was going through puberty before anyone in my classes were (just my dumb luck) and I wasn't very fit and I was chubby because of it- I got body shamed a lot (mostly by girls) and was basically teased and tormented because I didn't really fit in socially, and I was constantly excluded and treated like I was nothing more than the dirt on their polished black shoes.
So, yeah, plenty of things do contribute to my messed up mind indeed, but bullying is something that can (have) be moved on from. 
Being molested and taken advantage of is a completely different kettle of fish. Particularly if it is done by someone who is your own blood; someone who is supposed to protect you and love you appropriately. Someone who is supposed to keep you AWAY from that sort of person. 
I just couldn't believe it. I still can't believe it. 

I was only 10/11 years old. My body may have screamed 12 or 13 but I wasn't. I remained that age between the ears, so again I didn't understand the full extent of how bad and wrong this was and given my discomfort, I buried it right at the back of my mind so I couldn't remember it at all. It took me years to do that, years. It didn't take its full toll on me until I was 17.

He came to me about it. I was 17 and he was 20. I was beginning year 12 and my life was better- I had great friends, I loved my school and I was better socially. 
He however was trapped inside a small tight dome of sadness and sorrow. I felt horrible for him, but I there was nothing I could say or do that would make him feel any better. He was victimising himself, and constantly saying that everyone else was a jerk and that he didn't understand why he was constantly rejected by people. He and his girlfriend had been broken up for nearly a year by then, and the amount of 'friends' he had, minimised. 

I wonder fucking why idiot, they were shitty low lives who used you for rides and alcohol. Fucking duh.

He began to date this new friend I recently made, L, and I didn't know her very well, but I knew enough that she was very superficial and boy crazy so I kept her in small doses in order to maintain my sanity. 
But she decided to eye my brother and he was happy to oblige, despite how uncomfortable it made me feel. I didn't say anything because it was their life, not mine. But the thing is, he's very selfish and jerky when he's happy. I feel so evil and guilty being around him now, because either way, I don't like him. He's an arrogant arse when he's happy  and everything's going his way, and he's an emotionally draining douche when he's down in the dumps. And it's always only one or the other with him, he can't do neutral at all and it's fucking annoying. 
Because L wanted me to come to this event with them and I said no ( I was ill and on my period) he pushed me into coming and did the sad face thing when I said no. I eventually caved and came after all, but I regretted it almost instantly. I counted down the minutes to home time BUT NO it was 12 am and L decided that she wanted him to come over because SHE wanted cuddles and a make out session. 
Imagine being in the same bed as your sibling and their lover as they pash and do stuff in front of you. Feeling uncomfortable yet?! 
I was exhausted and ill, but with no concern for me whatsoever, he instantly agreed.

Fucktard.

And we stayed there until 2 am in the morning. 2 am. She lived at the opposite side of town, at least 20-30 minute drive. I was so angry, but I was too tired to protest, nor did I want to ruin it for him. I tried to dose off in the car, but then he decided to get heated up and angry because someone at the event in our social group said by accident that they thought that he was younger than me. It was so out of the blue when he got angry that i got startled and anxious. He yelled and cussed as if I was the one who said it.i said nothing, but that made me feel even more angry and upset. I felt like crap, I looked like crap, and I felt like all this pressure was forced on me, yet he was the one having a god damn temper tantrum in the car at 2 in the morning? What the hell? 

The next day, I kept myself in my room and refused to come out, even if someone were to beg me. He came in looking normal and chirpy and starts talking about our past like it wasn't a big deal, asking me about it- I tried to brush it off because it had been years and I didn't want it to come back to reality, but he kept going on, saying 'harmless' comments; 'oh, it's just, I read about it, and apparently it can really fuck you up in the future,' 

Really? REALLY?! WHAT DO YOU NEED TO READ TO KNOW THAT MOLESTING YOUR LITTLE SISTER IS WRONG?? AND WHAT RIGHT DID YOU HAVE TO TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT IN A CONDESCENDING FASHION AS IF I WAS THE ONLY MESSED UP ONE? WHY DID YOU FUCKING BRINH IT UP YOU THOUGHTLESS PIECE OF SHIT? DIDN'T IT CROSS YOUR NEXT TO NON EXISTENT MIND THAT IT WOULD UPSET ME? 

Before I could respond, his face had gone all red and he burst into tears and started throwing apologies at me. 
I said it was fine, because again, i really didn't want to hear it as I didn't want to remember it. 
But it was too much. 
I was never good at facing my problems, I always saw as past affairs that are no longer relevant, and if I wanted to respond and get upset, I should have acted when it was happening. 
Hearing this, spending years of keeping this at the back of my mind, it somehow affected me greatly. It was brought back from the dead, the flashes started happening, then the nightmares, it was all whirling in my head, along with everything else that I was still dealing with. I got so stressed. School became hard, communicating with people became hard, my anxiety levels rose up. it was eating me up inside, and it put a real strain my relationship with him. It got so bad to a point where I tried to top myself with mixing bleach with energy drink. Thankfully I was messaging someone at the time and they came straight over and dialled 000. I told my parents about my other problems except that one, because in a way, I felt like I would be betraying him if I said anything. He was on edge emotionally, despite everything that was happening for him, and I thought that this would just go away if I told my new psychologist. 
It didn't.
It made it worse.
I never liked counsellors or psychologists because the procedures were always slow and emotionally draining, almost feeling like they were encouraging me to dwell. I was in year 12 and I had other commitments- I did not have time to DWELL. 
This one also suggested that I ignore him completely, as if he wasn't there. I thought that was complete rubbish and I asked for other strategies. She insisted on telling my mum. 
It was horrible. 
This stranger and I were telling my mother that her son molested someone. That someone being his own sister. It would have crushed her. I'm not a complete brat, I do genuinely care about my parents wellbeing. But later on at home, she asked me to be honest and tell her the truth. Tears obviously weren't enough. She mentioned that I had been dishonest before so my credibility was apparently shaky. Yeah, what serious stuff have a lied about, aside from taking the last biscuit from the jar?! That damaged my confidence in her quite a lot, like she was convinced that I was just a trying to ruin my brother's life, like the awful sister I was, even though it was him that ruined mine. 

She told my dad, and told me that she would speak to him at some point, but was 'worried because he's really on edge,' 
But, I was the one who ended up in the emergency room? Mum? Hello?? 

This was the same person who would constantly death glare any boy I brought home/smiled at me. Saying that he would kill anyone who hurts me, that he would keep me safe, when really, I was safer with those boys than I was with him. He's the one that ruined me to the core, yet here he his acting as if every other guy within my distance was a potential predator. The hypocrisy just makes me want to throw him off a damn cliff.

It just gets harder and harder to be around him now. He spent all of last year on the couch with no job and no life, and telling me everyday what's wrong with feminism and how women are always wrong. It's one thing to have a strong opinion, but having to stomach that same rant everyday, particularly when it conflicts with your views is just absolutely unbearable. Given what he has done, I can't help but scream in my head that he has no right to tell me that nor to force it at me as if he was trying to make me think like him. I still can't have one conversation for more than one minute without it turning into a antifeminist rant. Again, I don't really care, I'm just really sick of hearing it. And I told him that, BUT HE JUST KEEPS CONTINUING LIKE THE DISRESPECTFUL CUNT THAT HE IS. 
And I don't want to hear HIS views on rape and violation because HE VIOLATED ME. Why should I have to put up with this bullshit? Why?! 

My parents don't seem to take any notice of this. Im not comfortable with him kissing or hugging me anymore, or just being in his presence in general. He's at university now in another state, but he's visiting now for my dad's birthday, which is fine, but small doses. I don't go out of my way to hug him to talk to him, I'm just neutral and I pull away every time he tries to hug me. His affection towards me is just too strange and uncomfortable and somewhat creepy. He used to go in my room and go through my things and then get pissed off when I'd tell him not to. When I got some new bras, he was looking at them and started to compare my chest to his ex's. Bit pervy? 

He's strange and tense and I just don't like him or respect him anymore. He's too much for me to deal with and my parents refuse to understand it. Mum is fixated on us being a normal close knit family, whereas there's no such thing. 
I feel forced to have a relationship with him, and I don't want to have one, and it upsets me. It's like I'll have to divorce my parents too if I do him. It's not fair. I love my parents so much and I don't want to lose them but it looks like I may have to after I become an independent adult. 

I just don't know what to do with myself.

23,"I hope this is the right place to post this. I was raised in a family that kind of inadvertently fostered Co-dependant behaviour through our religion and culture. As a result I have a lot of anxiety when it comes to being independent. I also find myself being very pessimistic whenever it comes to something about my future. I am a very goal oriented person within the confines of what I am allowed to do as a adult woman born to my Muslim family, and I have done my best to excel in school, work or whatever I do. My biggest issue is anxiety. Anxiety that gives me so many painful and negative effects throughout my body. I have come to realize that I always default to thinking the worst could happen to me in my situations, and I worry about it all the time. 

I'm in the middle of leaving my family home without their permission and I will most likely lose my family for a very long time. It's normal to have anxiety in this situation, but I'm afraid my anxiety will really hurt my body. I've been anxious for a week straight.

In the past I have been anxious, but those situations always turned out in my favor and I feel like I might be associating anxiety with success in some strange way. 

Can anyone recommend steps towards a healthier mindset so that I can train myself to stop defaulting to anxiety?

29,"I always knew he had severe depression for the past 8 years, but he was recently diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder which actually answers.so many questions and fills in the blanks.

This diagnosis has severely been messing with his sense of identity and confirming in his mind that he's just crazy and will always need treatment. For him, this has just solidified his justification for killing himself.

This morning he said he was at peace with himself because he finally figured out how he was was going to do it. (Not posting the method to avoid triggers, but involves ordering medication online.)

He said he will either do it with my support or without and it was a courtesy to tell me.

From the timeline he described it sounds like I have about a month to work with - sometime before his birthday in May.

He said if I tell his therapist, parents, or call 911, he will just disappear and do it without me.

No amount of pleading or how much I need him to be around is convincing. He says he can't love me if he hates himself so much.

Please, what do I do? If I contact anyone, he'll see this as a betrayal and I risk him disappearing.

For background, we've been married 7 years and in our 30s. No kids, we both have great jobs, live comfortably.

I'm worried, scared, and I just don't know what to do. This BPD diagnosis has created havoc and he only sees himself as a burden.

After telling me this, he's just like - ok, let's go to brunch! And now he's playing video games, but says this doesn't deter from his master plan. My crying only shuts him down.

Do I secretly contact his therapist? His parents? I'm open to any advice. Thank you.",12Mar2017,1,
30,I have good mental health except when it comes to my girlfriend who I've been dating for several months. I always think she is going to die. Whenever she drives to work I think she might get into a car crash. I always need to know where she is and if she doesn't reply to my text messages within a few minutes I assume she is dead. When I keep messaging her she gets very upset so I usually suffer for a few hours until she replys. But sometime I get so overwhelmed i call her and text her so much. I'm so scared she is going to break up with me because she thinks I am a freak. I don't know what to do or how to stop worrying about her safety. Please help. ,12Mar2017,1,

32,"Okay, I'll get started with things that have happened today.
Full disclosure: I know the things that I do are not okay. I know I should seek professional help (I have and I am). Posting on reddit is a last resort. So please, no judgement.

Today I did some social engineering to try and find more about my boyfriend's ex. Which is wrong. And I did manage to find out things I had been looking for. But I feel gross about it and anxious and awful. 

I've done many things about my obsession with her that make me feel awful:
-stalk her social media
-pretend to be her on social media as a means of discovering more about her
-tried and hack into her social media, etc.

She lives in a different country or I'd probably try and meet her or something. 

Here's the thing. I've always been obsessed with my boyfriend's exes. I know what triggered it. The first boy I was in love with still had feelings for his ex. He took my virginity and then immediately stated ""I wanted to save my virgnity for [ex-girlfriend] because I love her and not you"". Thus I began obsessively trying to be more like his ex, etc.

It consumes my life. I compare pictures of her and I side-by-side to try and determine who's pretty. Also doesn't help that she's an artist and so am I. So art comparison is huge.

More about me:
I'm a fairly successful person for my age. I work at a high-paying job. I have a 3.8 GPA. I have many friends. I just completed my second gallery show and am working on my third. 

I have an appointment to see a psychiatrist for this very issue and see a counselor regularly. I also meditate and try and maintain a spiritual view of the world. I'm healthy, physically and mentally (except for this one issue). I suspect I may have OCD though.

I've asked random people on the internet to compare us phsyically. And I wish I could share this obsession with someone. I'm just dying to hear ""You're prettier, smarter, more successful, nicer, and have better art"". But I know that's not a reasonable thing to ask for or to want. 

I'm looking for solace. Perhaps someone can relate. Or advice (besides from the 'seek professional help' because I have and I am and it's not doing much for me). Thanks.  ",12Mar2017,1,

34,"In recent days, there are a few experiences going on that make me think that I'm about to lose my mind.

First, I often see myself acting, like it's in a movie. Then, other people are like they're acting, too. Everything feels unreal and I cannot believe it's true in any way. Everything looks unreal, too.

Sometimes, I believe I am in reality in some kind of mental institution, living there being crazy, but in my inner world, there's a completely different story going on (e.g. writing on reddit). Then, some thoughts cross my mind again and again, like in a row. And I get the mental picture of myself in something of a rotating yin-yang-symbol with me in both sides, one happy, one sad, always spinning around. I can differentiate this from reality, but it still occupies my mind.

Then, it's hard to listen to other people. My short-time-memory seems to be kind of weird. Sometimes, I feel like having a billion dÃ©jÃ  vus, repeating the same scene again and again (for example, my partner and I sit in the kitchen and eat without talking, then I look at him, he does something, I look away, I look at him again, he does something and so on, in kind of an endless loop; at least it feels like that, it usually is differenciated enough for me so I can see it's not really looped in time.)

Also, I cannot get away from questions like ""what am I?"", ""what does it mean to 'feel' something?"", ""what does it mean for me to have a name?"", ""why am I here?"", ..., I see why these questions are neccessary for a philosophically-interested human, but they're too much in my head since I need to find an answer but I know I never will. I feel, in these situations, very disconnected, not only from my body but also from everything else. I feel like a spectator, living inside a bowl filled with TV-screens that show somebody's life, forcing me to see it as he did.

I feel like a spectator most of the time, even with my own thoughts. And then I think about thoughts and thinking about thinking about thoughts and...

Also, I usually become extremly quiet. I can still talk, and I can still answer, but the answers are short (though usually on-the-point) and I cannot hold up a dialogue.

This all is kind of Ok, but the feeling that nothing, including myself, is anyhow real, that's what bugs me. That's what's giving myself the idea that I am, actually, insane and already in an insane asylum.

I often feel like I am the only thing in existence, and everything else, the stuff I see and hear etc., are just made-up things I created from my mind. This thought never leaves me in such situations (which are often, but not 24/7, luckily).

I've read quite a lot about hebephrenic schizophrenia, and a lot of my stuff matches there, but I'm afraid to go to my psychiatrist and tell him my idea, because, if I'm wrong, I may be assigned a hypochonder and may not be taken seriously.

But except for being kind of quiet, ""outsiders"" cannot feel this. I do not *do* crazy stuff, but think about reality as if I were really crazy. This scares me a lot.

So, what might this be? Might it be schizophrenia-caused or related? And what are further resources to check this out?

I'm a 23-year-old male with a pretty bad childhood (a nearly-complete neglection of my mental skills, only bodily things were taken care of) and a mother who suffers some mental diseases too, especially depression which I've got, too.",12Mar2017,1,
