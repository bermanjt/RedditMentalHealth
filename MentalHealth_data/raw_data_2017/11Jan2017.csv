0,"I'm looking for some good books about having a loved one with Borderline Personality Disorder. A close friend of mine was recently diagnosed and is having a rough go of it. This person's behavior has always been the way it is since the diagnosis, but only after said diagnosis did I realize (with the help of my own therapist) that the way I'm treated by this friend because of the BPD is unhealthy. 

My therapist suggested a book called Stop Walking On Eggshells. I'm interested in reading it, or a similar book, and I'm looking for some suggestions or insights. Normally I rely on word of mouth and online reviews. The situation I'm running into when looking for reviews on books of this subject matter is that a lot of the reviews are from people suffering from BPD who feel personally attacked by the content of the books.

Anyone with a loved one with BPD have any suggestions for books? I'm interested in what Eggshells deals with, but I want to know if there are better options. If possible, please explain why you suggest the books you suggest. ",11Jan2017,3,
1,"When wrist watches don't work on them, my family says 'oh my polarity is off'. My family is rife with mental health issues, and I am myself. I really want to have (yet) another battery put in my wrist watch. It's cute, and I like looking at a watch rather than my phone. But it ends up stopping sooner rather than later. Is my family right, that the more 'off' your mental health is at any given point the more likely it won't work?",11Jan2017,1,
2,Having a hard time making a decision on whether to stick with pharma meds or go with nootropics. I'm a former adderall abuser and am now on a benzo and ssri. I am currently on disability and have an appointment with a new psychiatrist on 1/24. I feel like i need something to control my racing thoughts but don't really trust the doctors. Any advice?,11Jan2017,1,

4,"So, to begin, I'm eighteen-years-old. I'm studying at a nearby college, and I'm your average, friendly guy, who loves to work hard and achieve his goals.

However, I am a severe hypochondriac.

It all began when I was in the fifth grade. I was relaxing on my couch when I felt my heart skip a beat or two, which scared me tremendously. I notified my mother and she seemed a little panicked, too. This didn't help.

I worried that entire night. Obviously I lived, and the cardiologist said there's nothing wrong. But a few months later, on my way out to dinner, pains in my stomach made me believe I had appendicitis. I was frightened.

I lived through those years up until now, always thinking I have appendicitis, heart issues, sometimes even cancer. I remember spending an entire month of the eleventh grade thinking I had brain cancer.

Even today at work my twitching eyelid, which has been going on for two days, makes me feel like I have brain cancer. It is just so scary to me. The second I get a thought like that, my body goes numb. It shakes me up and I get anxious.

But one thing different between me and other hypochondriacs is that I HATE visiting the doctors. When I read about others with this, they say they are constantly at the doctors. I, on the other hand, never go unless it's something urgent or a check-up.

I really wish I didn't have to deal with this hypochondria. Does anyone else struggle with this? What helps you?",11Jan2017,5,

7,"I'm a 23-year-old man. I was diagnosed with autism when I was 11, and diagnosed with depression a few years ago, after struggling with it for years. Last February I suffered a major concussion. I'm taking Wellbutrin for my depression, I went off my meds against medical advice in September and back on in December.

Beginning around August, long after I was medically cleared from the concussion, I started getting a feeling of being completely unfocused on the world. For long stretches, I was unable to really engage with anything. I wasn't able to play games or watch movies that required prolonged attention, and I wouldn't really remember what I experienced during this time. To do any work required a ton of effort just to focus on the basics. I became mentally exhausted, because if I took a vacation for a week, I would forget having done it so it felt like I was constantly working. I've described this variously as being blacked out or on autopilot, but it doesn't feel anything like being drunk, and I can't compare it to any other experiences I've had. I'm seeing my therapist tomorrow and I'm hoping to be able to explain what I experience. What is the name for this state of being? Is it something caused by depression, concussion, or something else?

The last face to face counsellor I went to tried to turn me into a Christian Buddhist mix, and whenever I talk about abuse or anything from my parents all the people just say ""well have you tried talking to them and telling them to stop?""

13,"About a year ago I was very depressed and anxious. After discovering Albert Ellis' A Guide to Rational Living, and really working through the components of REBT I started to both assess myself cognitively and emotionally in a more positive way.
If you don't know the basics of REBT are about accepting yourself, others, and life itself as imperfect and realizing deeply that most of the time we upset ourselves through irrational SHOULD and MUST statements, like ""I SHOULD have a good job to be happy"" or ""my parents MUST treat me respectfully!""
If our irrational needs and wants are not met (which they usually are not in this highly imperfect world), we tend to feel upset, anxious, and depressed. REBT, and Albert Ellis' teachings, are about truly accepting the imperfection of life and attempting to be happy and enjoy it regardless. A lot of his teachings are based off of the Roman philosopher Epictetus.
I encourage any of you who are curious about REBT or have had a good experience with it to go to /r/albertellis!

15,"Hey Reddit! Heads up this is my second time posting so sorry if I'm not doing this right (already screwed up the first time).

I'm working on a project for school that is made to help people with their mental health. The concept is to have you express your struggle as a design (by, writing, drawing, ripping the paper, painting, etc) in the square (will be in a link below). There will also be lines under the square where you can give a description of your design or insight on your struggle. 

Once done, I will then show theses designs to the world by putting them up on a wall. As people walk by they can read and look at the designs, if they feel they can relate or just want to show they care, they can take transparency paper and draw on top of your design to help motivate and inspire you. 

At the end of it, I want to take your struggle (the design) and recreate it into something positive from strangers who want to help in some way. 

Really hope this was understandable. If you feel like being apart of this project (it would also be helpful), the link will be below. 

Once again, the square is to express your struggle, lines under the square is for a description on your struggle.   

When done you can post it in the comments or send me a private message on Reddit. I will then send you an image back on what others drew on your design when done. 

Feel free to ask any questions, I'm also open to any advice on how I can improve on my project. 

Thank you for reading and remember there are people who care :)

16,"I [16M] don't really know how to put it but I find it really hard to act normal. The important thing here is I *can* do it, but maintaining it for anything over 30 mins really stresses me out. When I say act normal, I mean simple things like looking people in the eyes, maintaining a meaningful conversation, even just sitting or standing normally without people thinking something's wrong. I'm only truly calm when I'm in bed, on my own, in a dark room. 

I've been living with chronic pain and depression for over 3 years now so maybe that affects things. I've only recently got medication for both but neither of them completely ""fix"" me. The anti-inflammatories (my pain is from Juvenile Arthritis) just numb the pain a little and the anti-depressents are what even allow me to maintain those 30 minutes I mentioned earlier. Without them I really can't do much at all other than make it out of bed for food a couple of times a day.
 
Surprisingly, I manage to maintain a social life online. It's much easier to talk to people when you don't have to worry about how you physically look or act and I can simply turn off the computer and get back into bed if I really need to. It's a much easier environment to operate in.

Because of my chronic pain, a tutor comes round every morning to teach me. The lessons vary from 1hr - 1hr30mins. It's just enough time to cover everything but by the end of each lesson I'm so exhausted that I'm basically useless and just need to get back to bed. During my lessons it’s often really hard to concentrate because whatever I’m doing I’m *always* singing a song in my head. This is without exception. When I’m lying in bed, when I’m eating food, when I’m doing anything. There’s always a song. It’s often the same song for a few days at a time, for example today and yesterday have been “Say it ain’t so” by Weezer.

I want to have a normal life but I really don’t know how when I can’t act like a functioning human being. Are any of the things I’ve mentioned symptoms of mental illness, and if so, what sort of treatment should I seek? Thanks

18,"Late 2015 there was fellow who I worked with. Now he wasn't on my crew but we all know each other and we worked in close proximity. Part of my job was to be all over the facility and as such I saw everyone all the time. 

I had noticed for a bit that this fellow. Ted always seemed grouchy as of late. At some point just talking to him and saying hi I felt that he wasn't so much as grouchy but something was bothering him.

I mentioned it to a few other coworkers and they said similarly. Myself and a few others tried to talk a bit more and ask him if he's ok. He wasn't overly talkative. I did find myself with some time to have a 1 on 1 conversation. 

To keep it short, he was very very depressed and that depression made him feel that his life didn't matter. I knew he had a family (a large one). We talked. All I knew to do was reinforce his value to his family, his friends, and us, his coworkers. 

He spoke pretty freely and it was during that time, myself and some others, we notified the company and asked for their assistance. I felt that they had a responsibility to their workers wellbeing. They helped out where they could.

In the end he took some time away and got the help he needed. I kept in touch on and off for a while. Best I could tell he was improving. 

I hadn't talked to him just over a year and today he was back at work. I can't tell you how happy I was to see him. He had a smile. He was happy. He had spent time away taking care of himself and bettering himself by going to school.

I'm a middle aged man but after he walked away and told me about he feels so great, his family is good, he's proud of himself and that he's proud to tell his son what he's accomplishing, I sobbed. I can't properly explain how great it made me feel to see him in a good place. I've cried out of pure joy only at birth of kids previously, but this was a moment I'll never forget. I'm really proud of him.

Everyone deserves an ear to talk to. A friend to listen. Don't ignore or walk away. It's the littlest things m, the saying hi, how are you, that could change a life. I'm a better person today because of his strength. Be a friend. Never think you don't matter. You do.",11Jan2017,5,
19,"Im diagnosed with depression, GAD/panic disorder, and ADHD. I've had depression and panic attacks since my earliest memory. 

There's been conversation going on in my mind for just as long. Very loud. Very unavoidable. I always assumed it was just me or something. 

The past 2 weeks I've been put under some of the strongest anxiety inducing situations I've had to face yet and with that came an amplification to the conversations. I realized one day that there are at least 3 different voices going on. That includes the voice I hear when I hear a thought. They have different tones and say different things. 

One voice whispers that I need to kill my self, I need to hurt myself, that I don't deserve love, etc
Another voice is like a hissing noise and it tells me every bad possibility to any situation that may or may not be real. 

both have the power to play film reels in my mind. Vivid images of things, almost like I'm watching a movie. 

The first plays graphic images of self mutilation, and the other plays out the most uncomfortable of scenarios for things I'm feeling most anxious about. 

There might be a third voice that involves impulse with drug abuse. But I'm not sure of that one yet


I find I'm exceptionally good at becoming self aware of my mental health. I am not good at coping with my mental illness though. I also have a serious problem with dissociating which makes coping quite difficult. 

I needed to get this off my chest. I see my psychiatrist in 2 days but I don't see my therapist for another week. I'm not sure how I should bring this up, if it sounds like there could be more going on than what I'm diagnosed with, or if I'm overreacting. Life has been really fucking hard lately and I'm barely pulling through so if anything, support would be nice. ",11Jan2017,4,

33,"Hey all! This is my first time visiting and posting here, so I'm sorry if I'm asking in the wrong place. I wanted to ask if anybody has experienced something I had in elementary and middle school (and occasionally during high school), and if this is something others have had. It's a bit difficult to explain, but I'll try my best. 

Basically, I would experience this screaming inside my head. It wasn't an auditory hallucination, it felt more like my inner voice (like when you read) was screaming at me. Sometimes it was triggered by sounds, such as static from a TV or radio, while at other times it was just totally random. While this screaming was happening, I would have these weird mental images. One was a totally perfect sphere, faultless in every way, that kind of made me uncomfortable. The other was the same sphere but mangled, twisted, and covered with scratches, dirt, and blood. The two images would flash back and forth in my head, and I was often forced to leave rooms or listen to music to try and silence my head. In 8th grade, I went to various physicians to talk about what was happening and even got an MRI scan done. The professionals I talked to thought it could be seizures, but they eventually said that wasn't the case. The MRI turned up with nothing, and ever since I have not known what was happening to me. I still have these screams, but it's much more uncommon now (maybe once or twice a year).

43,"I hurt people. I don't mean to. I can't stop hurting people. I never try to hurt anyone. I don't want to hurt anyone. But for some reason, I literally can't do anything except hurt people. 

I've been unemployed since November (coincidentally I lost my job the day after the election). I've been living with my parents since. I try to eat as little as possible now so I don't spend their money. But I have to keep eating their food and drinking their water so I don't die. I apply to jobs every fucking where and none of the fuckers ever fucking respond. I'm not sitting on my ass. The more work I put in, the less results I get. 

So I push people away when they offer help. They only do this to validate themselves. My parents wanted an intelligent child, a beautiful child, a happy child. Instead they got a 21 year old bum who can't even get hired to a fucking minimum wage position. Gas stations and restaurants and car dealerships galore. Nothing. Not one fucking response. 

The people I used to socialize with have jobs and sex and all the things that keep them deluded enough to not want to die. 

I've wanted to kill myself for as long as I could remember. For the longest time, I could put it off by convincing myself I had a direction. I finished high school, this past month I finished college. It's amounted to nothing. My degree is pointless if I can't even get a foot through the fucking door. So I just sit and sit and sit and sleep and eat and shit and amount to nothing, because I have amounted to nothing. 

I'm really half tempted to kill myself with a sign taped to me saying ""Donald Trump made me do it."" At least that way, people would actually care about me for a fucking second. I don't deserve care, I don't deserve love or kindness. I deserved to be slowly tortured worse than any Holocaust survivor ever was for the crime against humanity that was my birth. I am a demon child and must be eliminated from this plane of existence like you do with demons. 

The only thing keeping me from going right the fuck now is that my parents watch me like fucking hawks to make sure I don't do anything after my depression was outed to them by one of my cousins. They constantly check up on me, they treat me like a fucking infant. Probably explains why I'm not getting laid. As much as they despise and resent me for being a fucking failure, they don't want me to die. I can't die until I'm living on my own anyway. It's not fucking fair. Every fucking day I'm alive. 

Life is not precious, life is not a present, life is a fucking nightmare and an abomination. It's disgusting and sickening and I want none of it. Donald Trump is president for fuck's sake. There won't even be an America within the next year, he's going to get every last fucking one of us killed anyway. Mike Pence is going to electrocute us all, Rex Tillerson is going to fuck us up the ass with a flaming dildo, and Vladimir Putin is going to sit on the sidelines laughing with a bowl of popcorn as we all burn.

I stopped my meds about a week and a half ago and I am feeling generally good. My anxiety hangs out quite a bit but nothing I can't tolerate. I usually take medicine for sleeping and nightmares but other than having a hard time falling asleep, I'm getting a good night's rest and having pleasant enough dreams.

I'm feeling so good in fact, that it makes me question whether or not I am actually mentally ill. I know bipolar is cyclical so that's probably what's happening right now but I just feel like I have a habit of exaggerating my symptoms. Like maybe I just made it all up in a pity party in my head. I can't even imagine being as depressed as I've been (so far as hospitalization and self harm). It feels like that's a different person than me.

When I was a child I used to wrap bags around my head and go under the covers and hope to suffocate. Not a smart plan but being a stupid kid I didn't realize I'd just pull everything off once breathing got to be too hard. Still fully conscious when I removed them, not breathing was just too painful. I'd psyche myself up and do it again and again.

Also I have grabbed belts and hung from them, with them aligned in a way that should make you pass out and then kill you, but after I start to feel a little woozy I've loosened the grip and stood up a bit.

I've posted this in one other place and the response I got said that intent mattered, but I don't know what the intent was. I'll have a lot of thoughts of it but I'll think ""I can't kill myself because x"" (like family or when the physical pain sets in). Then I'll think ""I have to kill myself because y"" and will go and get everything ready. Then when I have something around my neck I'll think ""I can't kill myself because x"". Sometimes I push past the ""don't do it"" voice when the ""do it"" voice is loud but it prevents me from going all the way. Don't know if it's too halfhearted and doesn't fit the categorization, because my don't do it voice has always won in the end?

61,"Hi my name is Harry, i feel i have let a serious issue engulf me as a human over the past 3-4 years. Before i start explaining why i will first state I'm 21, male and of healthy weight. In school i was considered very smart, quick witted and generally a very switched on character. However since maybe 18 i have realised my brain struggling more and more to think and things which i used to find very easy such as equations in math and basically any problem what so ever. Its not like needing to jog my memory and then i remember, i feel my brain literally does not have the ability to think anymore. Ive also realised i find it very hard to process new information and remember it too which i used to be really good at.

Below i will list and briefly describe everything i have noted down on how i am feeling, any advice what so ever would be very helpful.

concentration problems - As soon as someone starts talking my mind instantly starts to wander no matter how hard i try to stay in the conversation, same with even my favourite movies and i find it impossible to read as i cannot concentrate.

no productivity - I used to be out going and loved being out the house doing things with friends. Now I've pretty much quit all my hobbies and mountain biking which i once loved i no longer have the urge to go and do.

disorganized thinking - If i try to think of something i cannot stop other things popping into my head and find it difficult to focus on one thing, also if i set my goal on achieving something i often find i focus on a small not important thing and struggle to keep my head thinking straight.

distraction - The smallest noise or anything will make me lose my train of thought instantly meaning i can no longer remember what i was doing and often leads to me going in circles.

forgetfulness - I know I've mentioned this above but no matter how hard i try and remember anything what so ever i cannot, if someone says i have a meeting i will forget 5 minutes later and not remember unless i am reminded again very close to the time of the meeting.

impaired cognition - This is a big one, you may be thinking that my cognition cannot be that impaired as I've written this however this post upto now has taken me over a hour to type as I'm finding it really hard to think of what to write whereas before i could write pages and pages of on topic things without struggling what so ever, this is one of my biggest problems right now. Its like I'm trying hard to think but getting no response from my brain as if there is a wall between my brain and body.

inattentivensss - Once again i know referenced above but i cannot stay focused on one thing for a long period of time, i would say 15 minutes is my maximum and that is only when I'm alone with no music and nothing else i could possibly be doing but what i need to be doing.

learning difficulties - Im finding it really hard to process and then learn new information and this is causing my to fail tests. Whereas before i was a top grade student who learned very easily and remembered subjects down to the smallest details and could recall them months later. Today i am lucky to remember the title of the article I'm trying to learn. 

lethargy - I have no get up and go which is leading my down a dark path of sitting in my room doing nothing.

memory problems - Basic things such as the order of the ABC and months of the year are becoming hard to remember, also i struggle to remember even family members birthdays etc. It feels as if i want to remember things so bad but the brain is giving me no response what so ever.

performance decline - In all aspects of life my performance has dramatically declined. From tests at work to just having banter with friends. This is causing me to social decline also as my friends have started to notice and i feel stupid because i struggle to give responses quickly to them and generally have little to no input into conversations anymore.

procrastination - This is a small one but i find my mind wanders alot and i find excuses not too do basic things such as house chores leading to nothing being done, i think this is linked to the rest so il keep it short.

psychomotor slowing - This is a big one it takes me a significant amount of time longer to think of a solution to problems than it used to and compared to other people i used to be really fast, this has being the most dramatic change in my opinion. I also struggle to think of the words to say and often have to change conversations as i dont remember what we were talking about.

social decline - As said above i am starting to distance my self socially as i feel stupid and that my brain just doesn't work anymore.

slow witted - I used to be able to think of responses to questions with sensible and correct answers without batting a eyelid however i now seriously struggle to even give a standard response and feel my brain isn't keeping up with everything else.

spaced out - Over i just feel spaced out a lot and struggle to pay attention to anything.

Summary:
Ok this has taken me close to 2 hours and I've made notes over the last month on how i feel. The easiest way to describe how i feel is that my brain is slowed down and no matter how hard i try to think or solve a problem my brain will not process and remember the information. It has progressively got worse over the years and now i feel a mist over my brain causing my to lose everything i once prided myself on.

Any help what so ever would be great, i know this is long and if you are still reading thank you so much

62,"26 year old female here. 

I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and OCD when I was 11. 

Reading about borderline personality disorder, I'm seeing a lot of similarities and symptoms I relate to.

Are there any BPD sufferers out there, and if so, can you talk about your experience with it?",11Jan2017,2,
63,"I've had anxiety and depression for a long time. When my anxiety was really kicked up I just spiraled around stresses forever. I've got that kind of manageable now. 

But lately I've just been feeling like this sense of doom and destruction, as though I know some huge awful thing is headed my way but I don't know what it is and it's freaking me out. I don't necessarily want to figure out what's causing it but move past it. 

Anyone have any recommendations to help me through this  ",11Jan2017,2,
64,"I'm curious. I went on citalopram and soon caused all sorts of very problematic side effects, and currently am tapering off but in severe withdrawal. My body is so messed up.

Clearly, I think they're all garbage (antidepressants, I can't speak on others but still dubious). Anyone have supporting or clashing viewpoints?",11Jan2017,2,

66,"Hey folks first time poster, recently I've been told by friends that are concerned.

Im honestly at a point where I dont care much about opinons of others, I dont know who I am as a person, and that Im somehow conflicted in either being a nice guy or an asshole . That being said to be honest I have feelings of apathy, where life is pointless(not contemplating suicide) but rather an apathy of not caring, a lack of empathy.

A friend messaged me and told me this 

""The problem is you dont care what people think, you dont care about yourself, and that's self destructive right there, how do you grow as a person without self improvement or care.. it's a scary thing knowing someone who feels that way and not knowing what to do about it. """,11Jan2017,0,
