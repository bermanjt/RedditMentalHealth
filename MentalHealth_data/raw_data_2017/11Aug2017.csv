2,"For as long as I can remember I've been battling with mental health issues. Although, I've never been diagnosed with anything I feel like I am not normal. I've have been in and out of therapy for a few years now but I don't find it helpful - I feel awkward and always lie about how I'm actually feeling inside.

Sometimes I hear voices but not like in a schizophrenic way - at least I don't think so - more like thoughts that are too loud and crash around inside your head until you just want to scream. 

I've dealt with self harming and cutting and all and I am proud to say that I am no longer that person although I still think about it all the time.

I honestly don't know where my life is heading and I sometimes just want it to end... I have attempted suicide so many times I've lost count... Although I know that I don't want it to end I just feel so sad all the time.

I also want to be thin, at the moment I weigh 85kg (13 stone) but I really want to be 60kg I use to  work out a lot and I walk really long distances but I haven't been able to lost much weight however people often tell me I've lost a lot of weight but I can't see it. Recently I have adopted bulimic tendencies like purging but I don't  believe I have an eating disorder. I honestly don't know what to do with myself, I'm trying so hard to be a better person and be happy but I feel so empty inside. I haven't really spoken to people about this so I feels kind of good to get it off of my chest but it also makes me feel like a wreck.",11Aug2017,4,
3,"If your parents abused you emotionally physically or sexually i will try to help those whom had experienced any of these forms of abuse.

First off i want to say that i am NO psychologist or life coach which means that i may not be able to help you or some of my answers might not be what you're looking for, if that is the case look for help to treat  trauma or grugde.
I will be sharing my story which is mostly to do with emotional abuse.

From what i remember my family never was the kind of family you get along with in christmas or haloween or any kind of family event.

My family is a extremely violent pessimistic and degenerative family i know of.
Because of there violent behaviour i never established that special bond with them.

I would see my grandmother screaming the loudest she could ever scream of anger when my sister asked if she could make her a meal.
She would yell ""do it you're self brat!"" out of nowhere because she always kept stuff in then later on bursted like a volcano it always made me feel horrible and shocked in fear. she still does that.

My grandmother has sociopathic behaviour i am no psychologist but hearing stories of her doing crimes and her being selfish is enough to convince me.
Nobody in my family likes her at all because of the problems she brought to our family and her behaviour.

She is the most annoying person in the world she keeps babling about things she dosen't like all the time and she is never satisfied.

My dad always seemed to be mad at everything also he always says he had the worst life ever.
Which is true but when you keep telling me that just to look tougher i gladly disagree with you.

My father used to hit or ground my sister alot i felt so sorry for her she was always getting hit and i could not do anything about it.
Luckily my sister is able to live on her life without my family the only damage to her psyche was that she dislikes long hairs after the day my dad tried to cut her hair off as an punishment.

When i saw the look on my own father's face while he was cutting off her hair i was shocked he looked insane.

My dad told me that he was insane but he was able to control it because of me and my sister which shows that even the coldest parent might have some hidden love for there own child.

Another example of my father's insanity is that he stabbed my mother while i was on her lap,  my family says i am childlish and eccentric because of that event i am not sure if that is true since i have no memory about that.

My dad suffers from PTSD which explains his outbursts of anger and immaturity.

Now my family never got along there was always fighting and drama because of the problems my grandmother generated sometimes it got violent and i had to ""hide"" so that my father or other family member start spending their anger on me.

As you can see my family isn't the best in my opinion they are slighty below average yes even if they keep buying me stuff.

My grandmother just buys stuff for me because she wants something in return.

But it does not matter someplace in my rotten empty heart i have some love towards my family.

However their behaviour is not something i want to deal with.

Now i want you to tell me your story and i'll try to help you out.
You can be as honest as you like and you can ask me questions about my family and myself.

If you are suffering with PTSD please get help.

5,"it's like 1am right now and i'm currently home alone with nothing but our dog

and i'm freaked the fuck out and have nobody to talk to

i don't wanna go into too much detail, but i'm terrified to leave my room now",11Aug2017,1,
6,"ok, so i have a cousin. He can to stay with us last year for a few weeks, which stretched in to months while he looked for work in this country. 

He has had and still has issues with what i choose to call ""personal darkness"" and this tends to manifest itself as alcoholism.

At the same time i was trying to look after my mum, who has been a drinker since i was a kid. This meant whenever i went to see her calling an ambulance so that they could dry her out, because she invariably timed my visits with a huge vodka binge.

We tried having her live with us, i tried going down to see her two or three times a week, but that just increased the hospital visits. Every time i walked from the station to her flat i thought ""will this be the time she is dead, and what will i do?"".

Meanwhile he was descending - staying in his room, showing all the signs - i have grown up with them so i recognise them - of secret drinking. I kind of ignored it because i had a more serious someone-elses-drinking-problem to try and deal with.

Eventually in June of last year she died. The family all came over for her funeral, and cousins mum saw what a state he was in and took him home.

He has been in and out of various support since.

A few weeks ago he asks if he can visit for a week, but the date keeps changing, he cancels, he re plans and then a few days ago he turns up, with his mum, but with a LOT of luggage.

All of a sudden his visit is open ended, until he gets a job.

I can't deal with this. Feel free to tell me what a shit i am, but last night i was on edge - looking for the signs again, wondering if i needed to intervene, how to intervene. I can't bear the prospect of this tension every morning and every night, nor can my wife, and although my son is off to University in a month or so i don't think he needs this either.

My plan is to sit down with him and talk about it, set some boundaries, explain how i feel, though i can't be sure why i feel it, but i don't want to make him feel unloved or unwelcome. He is clearly in a fragile state, i think i could easily make it a lot worse if i don't choose my words very carefully, and actually i suspect no matter how tactful i am it will be damaging for him.

I can't just let him stay and get ill and have the household be constantly tense and ""on the lookout"" for symptomatic behaviour.

TL:DR i'm a heartless shit who can't deal with alcoholism anymore, how do i not appear too heartless.",11Aug2017,3,

9,"For the past several months, maybe even a year or two, I haven't really been able to be sad. I don't really feel anything when I watch an emotional film or hear something sad on the news. Things either don't effect me at all or I start making sarcastic jokes about what I'm watching. I might say that I'm sad, but I don't really feel it. I haven't been able to cry in a long time too. Crying used to help me feel better when I was stressed or frustrated, but since I haven't done that in a while I don't have any other way to really relieve stress so it's just been building up. A lot.  I often feel an odd sensation that makes me feel hopeless and pessimistic too. I didn't expect to feel this way until I was an adult. Is this a problem or am I just blowing things out of proportion?",11Aug2017,2,
10,"im tired of trying to tell myself that they'll go away. because they get worse. 
them. 
the person who has to make sure my eating utensils are clean, that i rinse a cup out enough before drinking out of it, that i have to contantly rearrange things until they're perfect, and that they tell me that if this happens, then this will happen. they tell me things are that literally impossible. but i believe them.
then there's the person who makes me feel like im dead. or that i dont exist. or that nothing exists. that im not here and i never have been. they make me feel like i'm not me. like i've never been on this planet before. nothing is real. and after so long, they've made me believe it. i don't exist anymore. i'm gone. and honestly, to really tell you about this person, would be impossible. i think i know them the best. but i also know them the least.
then there's the person who tells me everybody is watching me. or that bad things will happen. they like to tell me mean things. they tell me i cant handle dealing with any social situation, and that everybody will think im ugly if my hair and my makeup are not absolutely perfect. i tell them nobody cares how i look. they tell me you're right, they don't give shit about you, in fact they probably hate you, but they definitely give a shit about how you look. this person also tells me to be afraid of everything. and that i shouldnt do things because ill freak out and theyll end badly. 
next one up is the one who is able to make me in a really weird depressive pissy mood. they make me be really mean or make me distance myself from people i care about, then they make me blame it on the people i was mean to. they tell me it was their fault. they make my mind really believe it, then i don't understand why people are mad at me. or saying i'm the one who's distancing myself. 
the last person, is the strangest. makes me not know what really is happening or not. whats real or not. they make me have such a warped perception of reality. this is another one that is very hard to explain much about them. i don't know much about them, because they make me not know much of anything. but they also make me know everything.

then there's me. and inside of me, in my head, are all these little people. and if you think about it, they all kinda go together in an odd sense. work as a team. they work all together to create the big clusterfuck thats me. and i don't like it. i want them to leave. those people are not me. they're not of me, they're just stuck in my head, and they won't get out. and i want them to get out. i want to get out.",11Aug2017,2,
11,"I have started a new job recently and one of my colleagues exhibits behaviour that are making it an almost unbearable atmosphere. 

He can be a nice guy one minute then insult exceptionally insulting the next. His behaviour is totally out of place in this company - openly racist and sexist bullying, bizarre fabricated stories that make no sense, and it is not clear what he does. But the older people around are exceptionally protective of him. 

What is going on here and how is the best way to approach this? If he is ill then I will take the insults on the chin but at the moment it is unbearable. 

He makes strange lip smacking movements frequently if that matters? Almost as if he is on MDMA, but not so bad",11Aug2017,2,

13,"She died 5:01. Sometimes I'll look at the time and it's exactly that time. I regret a lot of things. 
I didn't expect her to die from cancer, at 63 years old. I'm 19. I lived with her my entire life. I'm female btw. 
I go through my day normally, then I get flashbacks. Things that happened before during and after. I see her die in my head a couple times a day. I'm a horror fanatic, I'm used to reading scary stories, Im used to going online and watching videos of people dying, surgery videos, gory things in general. I'm soon going to be volunteering as a vigile volunteer (i basically go to hospitals and stay with patients who are alone, so they do not die alone)
You get the idea. I'm bad ass as fuck. 
I watched my grandfather go into the process of dying when I was 6/7. I miss the guy a lot. He was a great surgeon. Really great. Like get stopped by random strangers who tell me about how he saved their life great. 
It's hard losing people like that. 
My grandmother was also great. I can never love anyone the way that woman loved others. A memory that comes in mind is when I was literally shitting and vomiting myself about a year ago, and she was there with me, cleaning my vomit when my mother ran far far away from me, lol. It makes me smile. She would never gossip, she had a hard life. Her son died when he was just a baby, her daughters husband is in prison, it took a toll on her mentally I guess. 
Everyone laughs at my family. I hate humanity. Look at us right. My parents are sick, my aunt is in this fucked up situation, Im a loner, and everyone smirks while thinking of this. It's because they're so fucking jealous. Because my family is a good family. I'm definitely not biased, I wouldn't say it if it weren't true. I was raised right. I was at the dollar store recently and an old man dropped a dollar on the floor, i picked up gave it to him. He thanked me a thousand thank yous. Because not a lot of people would do that. 
Anyway, this has taken a complete mental toll on me, when I'm relaxed having fun, bam, the image of my family members dying. When I'm even pleasuring myself and half way through, my grandma with a hole in her neck comes to my mind, and I'm very imaginative, so it's all very vivid. 
I don't know what to do with myself anymore. The only reason why I am alive is because I want to go to school. I go to a junior. I want my degree in mathematics and biology and an associates in engineering I hope. I hope to take a new language and i hope to learn to play an instrument. 
But lately I've been struggling to love going back to school. 
One part of me is happy, well I wouldn't say truly happy but joyful, peaceful. 
Another part of me, longs for death. Like counting down the years I have left for a natural death. It turns me on. It makes me feel good. 
Another part of me, it's a side I have seen glimpses of, and I shut it down immediately, because I'm afraid of it.
I don't know who I am.
Every move I make, everyone takes note of it. My family is pretty well known. I breathe wrong and about 100 other people know. 
Like the fact that I'm bicurious but too afraid to be seen out with a girl. 
My psychologist once told me I'm too young to be diagnosed with personality disorder but he thinks it's what I have.",11Aug2017,8,
14,"I've been struggling with my mental health lately and I don't know why. I'm trying to figure out but that process makes me think everything is wrong with me. This will probably be a ramble because that's how my brain works, I haven't really prepared what I'm gonna say I'm just writing. 

I started to realise I might have a problem about a year ago when I was constantly feeling down around my girlfriend who is nothing but supportive. I started feeling like the relationship wasn't right and I've brought up breaking up several times and every time we cry and it's forgotten about and we try again. It's not fair on her and I don't even know if she's the problem or if it's my fucking brain telling me she's the problem. I've moved, quit my job, tried to pick up new hobbies but I just don't have any motivation or desire to stick with them other than 'wanting to'. That's not fucking enough you actually have to do. So why am I sitting on the floor right now at midday on a Friday writing this fucking thing out.
My dad was a dick growing up, or at least that's how I remember him. Always grumpy and shouting and telling me I shouldn't be on my computer so much and should be out with my friends or building my muscles. Or is that how I'm choosing to remember him to push the blame onto him? 
My mum used to drink a bottle of vodka a night and stumble up to bed while I sat in my room listening to her cry through the walls and wanting to fucking break shit because of it. She was the reason I wanted to move away from home. I hated her for that. Why would you do that to yourself every night? But maybe she's just as fucked up as I feel. I wouldn't know. We don't have that kind of family. My sister moved out when I was young after a fight with her stepdad, my dad, so I grew up alone and isolated for the most part with a dad I was scared of and an alcoholic mother. And father. He was just fatter so could handle his booze better. I remember the last time I said I love you to my dad after I told him to stop drinking so much so he didn't die before meeting his grandkids, his repose was 'thank you'. If the diabetes didn't stop him drinking I doubt that will. 
I took an ADHD test before and had to select 'yes' for every single answer. So here I am being treated for fucking depression and I'm not sure if it's depression, anxiety, adhd, something else or a combination of all the fucking above. 
Smoking weed every single day probably doesn't help but it's more of a habit at this point more than anything else. I don't even get much of a buzz anymore. 
So I sit on the sofa with my girlfriend every night with a million things running around my head in silence wondering why she isn't talking to me when I'm doing the exact same thing because I'm too in my own fucking head all the time. I hate it. I hate my fucking brain. 
So yeah, back to taking my antidepressants, thought they were doing something but here I fucking am and I'm getting worse so I guess they're not.

Well, that was all I had loaded in my chamber. Don't know if I'm looking for excuses or if I'm just a lazy cunt. Maybe I'll find out one day. 

Oh and I'm starting university next month and I'm terrified I won't be smart enough or able to concentrate long enough to take anything in.",11Aug2017,1,
15,"Okay, this is going to be a long post, and apologies in advance for any spelling mistakes as I'm typing on my phone. 

I don't know what I'm posting for, I just don't know what is going on with my head. I've just been upped from 15mg to 30mg of mirtazepine so that might be something to do with it. But honestly I just feel like shit. I just don't even have the energy to talk to my friends, I love them, but there's certain people I just can't stand to be around. I even struggling to be around my boyfriend, it's like everything is making me uncomfortable. I've gone like over a week at a time without seeing him, and he goes away again in September back to uni, so I should be making the most of him being here but I just don't know what's wrong with me. 

The other things that's freaking me out, is I've always been a very sexual person, I'd pretty much try anything, I'd been hyper sexual and I see that now, like I'd flirt with anything and anyone, I stayed loyal to my boyfriend asking I didn't cheat, but I've always been very flirty. I had a higher sex drive than my boyfriend and it was great. At that point sex didn't really mean anything for me, like I liked having sex with my boyfriend but it was more like a thing to enjoy rather than a thing to bond. And I think that's why I was so flirty because it didn't mean anything. 

I had something happen as a child that I see as abuse but there's a lot of grey area. And all this came out in therapy like a month or so ago towards the end of therapy. It was a three month course of DIT therapy but it's over now but everything is still so raw. And now I've gone the complete opposite to what I said before now, where I can't even see my friends and my boyfriend and sex is just so traumatic for me. Like I keep avoiding it, I do it occasionally because I want to, like Asin I want to be able to have sex, but I just cry, or get severe anxiety, it's horrific. And it's getting to the point where I can't see him comfortably incase he wants to have sex, and it's terrifying even though he's the most lovely, respectful guy ever. 

I just hate myself, I went to some assessment for a STEPPS programme for people with BPD but I didn't have the diagnosis then (got it 5 days later) so I have got to be reassessed because they believe RODBT might be better for me, but I don't think so, they said that because I have quite severe self image issues but surely that is a part of the BPD? 

I don't know what I'm asking for, if I'm even asking for anything? There's just so much going through my head rn and I just need some validation maybe? 

TL;DR I'm a fucking mess lol 

Thanks for reading guys

23,"Hello /r/mentalhealth,

This is a problem regarding both me and my ex's mental health. 
I live in the Netherlands (19 years old), and my ex (also 19 now) is from France. We met on the internet, were friends for 8 months and then discovered we both had incredibly strong feelings for each other. She never was officially my girlfriend but she was in practice. We never took on the label of ""couple"" because we never met in real life.

In December we made plans to meet up in January. However, from that very moment she kind of disappeared and when I confronted her with her lack of attention for me and absence and she started a fight which eventually led to her leaving me. She never gave any reasonable arguments about why I did anything wrong but she accused me of some things here and there. We didn't break off contact immediately but after she started snapchatting pictures of her kissing another guy and sending me very passive aggressive remarks I cut off contact. 

I became incredibly depressed. Losing someone you love is one thing, but so abruptly and without any good reason made it so much worse. I couldn't believe how this all happened because I genuinely thought she loved me too. 

In February we had contact because I wanted to ask her again if she wanted to talk about it. I sent her two long e-mails in which I explained my thoughts. She personally asked for the second one. Whereas my messages were long and thoughtful, hers were 3 sentences max and we broke contact again. In April we also had contact again but she told me she was dating another guy and told me exactly how good the first date was and such. I told her in all honesty how terrible of a move I thought that was from her part, and she responded by practically saying I shouldn't be such a pussy. Hopefully you get the pattern. 

We didn't have contact after that and my depression became better too, because I realized that the person I loved maybe didn't even exist. I was still quite unhappy though.

Last week she sent me an e-mail in which she asked me if we could talk on whatsapp or messenger. I responded with an e-mail in which I (according to her) brutally honestly explained exactly how I felt about everything and she could talk to me again when she had come to terms with everything she had done and said. Couple of hours later she responds and tells me she is sorry about everything, that she had done terrible things and nothing was ever my fault. It was purely her mistake. 

Now, I was still skeptical and asked for a more detailed clarification. 

I always knew she had a friend who committed suicide when she didn't show up to meet her after school. She told me back at the time that she didn't feel guilty but she couldn't sleep well ever since then. She went to see a doctor a lot to get sleeping pills. I have always been aware that there was more going on than I was told. Apparently this doctor is a psychotherapist that she calls a lot. The psychotherapist had told her to set goals for the future to stabilize her life. Studying law had became one of it, and in November, 3 months into the first year, she started doubting her choice of studies. She lost track of everything and also starting doubting whether she still wanted to be with me or not. From this point, getting away from her studies and getting rid of me became a goal. 
She also admitted that everything she did and said from that point was intended to hurt me because she wanted to get rid of me.

She also told me that she had sex with a 27-year old university teacher to lose her scholarship. I am incredibly shocked by this because this is totally the opposite of who she was in my eyes. 

She fought with all of her friends over this and went through a really bad period in her life. In May, her psychotherapist and her made a plan to make everything right. She made up with her friends and I don't know exactly what else but I was the last step in the process, so she came to apologize to me last.

This week I explained everything about how she influenced me personally in all honesty. She feels guilty about it and sometimes says she has to leave to process everything I say. 

We both agreed we want to stay in touch so we can work towards becoming friends again. However, we also agreed to break off contact for 9 days so we can recharge and do what we need to do and just calm down. 

I hope to become friends with her again next week, or at least work towards it. However, after everything I said and considering how guilty she feels, it is hard for her to talk to me. And I also find it incredibly hard to talk to her because I am absolutely heartbroken by what she did with her teacher. It has shocked me and, I am ashamed to say, I even feel like a loser because I am a virgin still. I am sure she has had sex with more people too and I just feel inferior to her because of it. It is a massive insecurity of mine and I want to get rid of it. I was never insecure with her.
I feel my depression is coming back as well and the pain of everything she did and said is lingering deep inside of me somewhere. 

I know she is mentally ill and I am scared to become depressed again. However, talking to her one on one directly really helps to regain trust and feel better about myself.

I would like some advice on how to proceed when we get in touch again in 9 days. I have been brutally honest to her and she feels guilty. She says it feels ""heavy"" to talk to me. How should I approach her properly? How should I communicate with her and what should I take into consideration?
I'd like her to feel comfortable with me again. I told her this too. 

Secondly, how can I deal with the reality of the things she has done? (I understood that there are more, but smaller, things she has done and said to other people) I don't know quite how to explain, but you can be down to earth with your thoughts but I am not. Rather than down to earth, I have this idea or image of everything that happened in my head and it has this atmosphere around it that I get stuck in. This is where my depression comes from I think. How do I get out of that atmosphere/thinking pattern? 

I am confused and not thinking clearly. I also have no experience in dealing with serious mental illness in other people. How do I go forward? What can I expect from her? What should I do/not do and say/not say? How can I make this as easy as possible for her?

(Maybe important side note: We also had a short 40-minute conversation on the phone. It ended when she told me she was not trustworthy, sick in her head and crazy and cried because of it. She has a terrible self-image.)

For now, we are absolutely on good terms but things aren't going smoothly because she is too busy (she is busy with something she apparently can't tell me about) to talk and it takes a lot of emotional effort from her, and the same goes for me. I just feel terrible about all this. That is why we are taking this break from talking for now.

Anyway, I hope this is somewhat of a clear story. I would really appreciate any remarks, advice, or questions that you have so I can bring this to a good end. Thanks in advance :)

26,"[Unbroken ](www.wegounbroken.wordpress.com)
This is pretty much the hardest thing I’ve ever had to write. 

I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder January 23, 2017 at age 25. This was 13 days after my last suicide attempt, and the last time that I cut myself. I had already been self harming my body with razor blades and an eating disorder for about the last 17 years; something that I kept hidden from everyone. It was a secret, and a shameful one at that. I checked myself into therapy because I did not want to resist the overwhelming urge to kill myself; I think about suicide as if it’s my “Ace in the Hole”, I know I always have an out if I want it. I was running out of reasons to not slit my wrists and bleed out in a bathtub full of warm water. Mostly I didn’t because my tub in particular doesn’t seal very well so the water wouldn’t stay full and that wouldn’t work. By no means am I a mastermind, irrational or rational, but I knew way, way, way down, under all of the uncertainty and insecurity, I truly did want to be alive. I wanted it to be acceptable to the Universe that, I to, wanted to have something that I could love and hold on to, and it wouldn’t leave me.

If you don’t know about Borderline Personality Disorder: Congratulations. 

In essence, BPD is a mood dis-regulation disorder in which a person, mostly women, cycles through mood instability, impulsive tendencies, self-destructive behavior,  fleeting sense of self/self identity, and unstable interpersonal relationships. BPD is typically some kind of trauma-induced  mental illness where the person irrationally fears abandonment and will do most things to avoid it. No— That’s not true, I would literally do anything to avoid it and I have done things that I am not too proud of to avoid it. It is not quite like being Bi-Polar where a person might swing between manic episodes and periods of depression; I race through emotions at light speed through out the day, and honestly, it’s exhausting. There are no medications that truly alleviate symptoms and many mental health professionals dispute among themselves if it even really exists. It is notoriously difficult to diagnose and many professionals don’t even want to put the diagnosis out there because BPD patients are considered too difficult to treat because of their fluid inconsistency. You can count on a Borderline to be unpredictable and most people eventually do not have good experiences with Borderlines. Suicidal idealization, self harm habits, impulsive behavior and the mood swings seem dramatic and alarming to more normal, better coping people. Borderlines come off as willfully manipulative, attention seeking and self centered individuals, ultimately resulting in the abandonment and rejection we fear the most. In actuality, Borderlines are often creative, intelligent, entertaining, passionate and inquisitive people. We just can’t think and feel at the same time. We’re much more inclined to hurt ourselves than hurt others.

Being unstable is a mother fucker

If I’m not doing something somewhat stimulating at all times, my mind wanders to some dark places. My fear of not having a place where I fit in and serve a purpose has led me to some unkind places and I have erratically tried to belong somewhere that’s not meant for me. Right now I’m happily feeling pretty normal, later I could be irritated all day at nothing and ready to lose my marbles in a depression, self-loathing fueled rage in a second over something someone else considers a minor annoyance. Sometimes it feels like I’m walking around with no skin, nothing to protect myself with and everything hurts. My choice in relationships have not helped my sense of self identity, but the relationships I “didn’t” have a choice in haven’t done many positive things either. I have found myself in more relationships than I can count, some very fleeting and some that meant more than the world to me. There was one where he had joked he liked “crazy girls”, and I laughed along. It stung, but I felt so unbelievably lucky that I thought I found someone, anyone, who by even considering loving me, was doing me a favor. I was lucky to have anyone. When he actively seemed to press on my triggers and rile me up, I wondered why, but then quickly thought that I was over reacting. Obviously. When he gave me the silent treatment, I would apologize until he talked to me again. I didn’t have the BPD diagnosis then, but I still felt like my feelings weren’t real. My lens was broken, I thought, I was probably blowing it out of proportion. When it ended, I blamed myself. I felt as though my body were coming apart as I sobbed and asked why, why, why, why. I asked him “Why not me? I don’t understand”. I begged the Universe to fix this thing that was wrong with me that made me so awful and so ugly that I didn’t deserve to be loved. I just kept repeating that I was sorry, as if I had failed. I really didn’t know what I was apologizing for. Existing, probably, and I had the pain in my chest, in my heart, that would not stop telling me I was just destined to be alone. There wasn’t anyone out there who would ever love me. I didn’t even love me, so how in this world could I even ask or hope that someone would see me as anyone worth having. I had lived in this vicious cycle my entire trying-to-form-relationships-life, even strictly platonic or friendships. It is defeating, soul-crushing, overwhelming despair. It must be what Hell is like; eternal damnation and punishment for reaching out and asking to be loved, validated and wanted. Please give me a sign its okay for me to be alive. I feel like there isn’t one, if there is I can’t see it by myself. I don’t understand why I would be put here and made to want something I can never have. It’s a cruel joke, and I’m the punchline. 

Recovery has been the hardest thing I have undergone in my whole odd life

I’ll fully admit that I’ve walked this Earth for as long as I can remember believing that I was a broken person. I was defective because I wasn’t wired right. When I met with my psychotherapist for the first time and she told me I was Borderline, I really thought I had a special way to say “crazy”. BPD just sounds bad. It’s as if I’m on the verge of being a psychopath, I thought. I am in month 7 of weekly therapy and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT skills). It’s fucking hard. I constantly would tell myself what a piece of shit I was because all of the bad, mean, or wrong things I have ever done that now I have an “excuse” for. I still did those things and hurt people along the way, I thought, and now I’m supposed to embrace the fact that I’ve been mentally ill this whole time and couldn’t help it. I’m just a hurricane waiting to strike at any given moment. I’ll hurt you but I can’t help it doesn’t sound great when you say it out loud. How I felt about myself leaked over into how other people viewed me, or in my mind judged me. I was a real party. Admitting that I have a problem I cannot solve myself, and then following through and consistently getting help for it, made me angry and embarrassed. I felt like I now had proof because my illness made me broken. It was as if I now had concrete evidence that I was a “cruel” person. That I was “too much”. That I was “crazy”. And most defeating that I was “unloveable”. I was just unbridled chaos waiting to strike.

I used to believe those things without hesitation. I hesitate now, and believe them less. I make a living amends for my destructive behavior by working on my recovery every day. It’s not to say that I’m completely better now or that I love myself. That’s still really hard. I did start dating again, and I am now dating someone who does not hurt me. No one is doing me any favors. I try not to rush, as rushing is another way of saying please don’t leave me. It’s not “I love you”, “I value you”, or “I see you”. That takes time and takes information, vulnerability and moving through fear. True partnership requires honesty, patience and risk. These things terrify me, but I try anyway.

This is how I know my recovery is working

On my own journey of recovery, I have found true freedom in exercise. I find that through the challenge of physically becoming a stronger and healthier person, I am beginning to be a mentally stronger and healthier person. On this road of picking my pieces back up, I am realizing I can become unbroken. There’s no rule anywhere that says I have to feel sorry for myself or that I can’t change. I can have anything if I’m willing to work. I’m ready to keep working. 

The truth about me is that I am a willful, strong and kind person who practices empathy where I can and when I hurt someone, I apologize. I talk way too much when I’m nervous and I know too much about otherwise useless, dorky things. I’d be a star on a quiz bowl team. I used to break doors and kick holes in walls when I was angry (which I do not recommend, btw, shits expensive) but now I find clarity and peace through Crossfit. I’m not perfect and I’m so beyond weird that it’s not funny. I make mistakes. I’m really afraid of hurting people. I love Disney and will never admit to being as much of a Basic Bitch as I secretly am. I follow 4 porn star accounts on Instagram. The road to where I am now has been hard fought, and I honestly didn’t think I’d make it. I haven’t come this far to just come this far. I have hope. I never thought that I would honestly be able to admit that. I also happen to have Borderline Personality Disorder. ",11Aug2017,1,
27,"I’m going to post this here and take the risk that it may be exactly the wrong thing for me to do and may only make me feel worse. This may be rambling and nonsensical and I know it drifts from first person to third person and from reality to metaphor.  There is no TL;DR. Read it or don’t. I don’t care. 

To me, it’s a paradox, or maybe more like a catch-22. One catch-22 wrapped within another.  I know that I need help. I know that I should get qualified help and should discuss with someone all of what is going through my mind. But I don’t trust anyone in healthcare, because it is an experience with a healthcare provider, with someone I was supposed to be able to trust and did trust and put immense faith in, whose failure to adhere to the ethical standards that applied to them betrayed that trust, and sent me down into this pit of darkness to begin with. They took from me my right to make my own choices. To control what happens to my body. To choose who touches me and how and when. They took from me the ability to feel safe with a healthcare provider. (To be clear at this point, I was not sexually assaulted in any way. This is purely a matter involving medical ethics, which I am perfectly well qualified to evaluate).  I lost every bit of privacy I had in my own physical being, and a lot of the privacy of my feelings as well, particularly feelings of and about pain. What I didn’t give up during the actual experience, I voluntarily gave up in trying to explain how this affected me and to get them to acknowledge and explain why this happened. Needless to say, I’ve had no satisfactory resolution, no real answer, no contrition, and ultimately have been told to just go away. So, what little bit of myself that is still private, that no one can forcibly take from me, is my own thoughts. If I were to “seek help” from a qualified therapist, I would be not only serving myself up to yet another healthcare provider who may or may not be worthy of trust, but would also be giving up that very last bit of myself that is private. Then I’m left with nothing. What little is left of *me* that is solely *mine* will have been turned over to a stranger, and I will have, once again, done it to myself. So instead I’m serving it up to the world of strangers on the internet. What a stupid thing to do. But at least perhaps in anonymity there is still privacy. And I don’t have any expectation of observance of ethical standards by strangers on the internet, so what the hell.

I’ve experienced plenty of depression. I’ve been depressed to some degree or another since I was about 13. It’s been punctuated over the years by more severe episodes that lasted 6-9 months typically. They follow a pretty consistent pattern. It comes about slowly—imperceptibly. Like sliding down an incline that is so slight you don’t even realize it’s there, until at some point you find you’re at the bottom of a deep, dark pit, with slippery sides. You don’t know exactly how or when you got there, but you know there is no way out. Even trying to climb those walls would be pointless and you just don’t have the energy to try. So you just lie there and wait to die. And somehow, at some point, it does get better, and the pit fades away and life goes on until next time.

This one was different. I was just standing there in my office at work, in a sling having just had surgery, in a lot of pain at the end of my first day back at work. Broken.  And so, so helpless. Who knew how awful it would feel to be unable to do absolutely anything for yourself.  Do other people actually like to be waited on?  Screw that. Being unable to take care of myself was humiliating. And such overwhelming pain. But there was hope. The healthcare provider you trusted. He was on your side. Tomorrow, he would help you to be less helpless. And it would get better.  And then suddenly before you there is this woman (in real life, it’s a phone call), a stranger. You’ve never actually met her but you know who she is. She’s his boss.  No, he’s not on your side, she tells you. Go somewhere else.  Why? She won’t say. Then there is no ground under your feet. And you look at the woman, and realize she’s pushed you off a cliff. In the instant you realize this, you look at her and her face registers no emotion. Not horror that you’re falling, or even surprise, or satisfaction even. Just a matter-of-fact expression. “This is how it is. I do this every day.” Then gravity kicks in, and you see the pit rising up to meet you. You hit the bottom with a thud. Every nerve ending in your body fires at once, and as the breath is forced out of your body by the impact, you feel hope go along with it. It rips through your heart and your soul where it used to live, and vanishes upward out of the pit in which you now lie. And as you lie there, waiting to die, you recall that in the moment before the woman pushed you off the cliff, there was someone behind her, whispering in her ear “push her.”  It was the one you trusted. The one you thought would make you less helpless tomorrow. Now there is no tomorrow. You are broken. You are helpless. And you have no hope. You wish for death, but it of course does not come. God is just not that merciful.

Months go by, and you’re still in the bottom of the pit, but most of the physical damage has repaired itself. You finally have the strength to call out to those above, the ones who are there to oversee the woman who pushed you. You yell for help. They call down “Sorry. Yeah, we know she pushed you. She shouldn’t have. We’ll tell her not to do that again.  See ya.”  You wait, thinking you’ll find the strength eventually to make some effort to get out of the pit. But that strength never comes. You call out again. Silence. You wait some more. Call out again. And they answer this time:  “No, we’re not going to help you. Go away.”

So now it’s over a year since I was pushed off that cliff, and have been here in this pit. I know I can’t climb out of it. I’ve just been trying to wait it out, assuming like all the other times, eventually the pit will fade away and I’ll find myself back in the land of the living again. But I don’t have any actual hope of that. Hope, as an emotion, is only an abstract concept to me now. It’s not something I personally experience. I use it in conversation:  “I hope all goes well in your interview.”  “I hope it’s sunny this weekend.”  But that’s just a word, not a feeling. And sometimes it’s okay and I’m resigned to just living here in the pit. But occasionally I look up, and I can see the cliff. I can see them standing there.  The one I trusted. The woman. The woman’s boss.  They’re going about their lives without a care in the world, as though nothing has happened. Because to them, nothing has.  They do not care. They never did care, even though that is ostensibly their job. But me? I hear her voice. I feel myself fall off the cliff. I see myself, from the outside, hearing her words on the phone. My knees buckling, my throat constricting and my chest tightening because I’m starting to cry. Leaning against the wall in my office. Slumping onto the floor with the disconnected phone in my hand. I live that moment and those sensations again over and over every day. 

In real life, I get up in the morning, I go to work, I exercise, I eat right, I meditate. I provide for my family. I smile. I make polite conversation. I socialize. I do all the things you’re supposed to do.  But in my mind, the part of it that is still only for me, I exist only in the pit.

30,"(If this is the wrong place to post this, my apologies: Please don't hesitate to tell me what, if any, might be a more appropriate subreddit.)

I could use the opinion of an objective party or parties about something; I’ve pretty much made up my mind on multiple occasions, but I keepdoubting myself.

My therapist, L, does not have much respect for my wife, who is dealing with MAJOR depression.  She does not understand her total inability to function at times, and openly questions whether my wife’s DBT is actually doing her any good.  L has been (with permission) in contact with my wife’s therapist (M) to discuss strategies; she *really* does not like L at all, and considers her very unprofessional, but has made some effort to meet her half-way.

Last night, L called me and we spoke for about 20 minutes.  During a meeting with the rest of her practice, L brought up my situation and solicited advice.  Overwhelming -- or so she tells me -- her peers recommended that my wife’s therapist drop her for non-compliance.  This should, in their opinion, *force* her into action, as my wife has clearly admitted an ability to function when things are at a crisis point.

(If the house was on fire, she’d be amazing.  But she ignores the flammable material stacked in the corners, even when there’s smoke rising from some of them, and generally leaves *me* to deal with them.)

She then left a voicemail for my wife’s therapist, in which she expressed the same feeling and apparently said that my wife doesn’t “deserve” to be in therapy.  Not surprisingly, M is not pleased.  On L’s recommendation (and again, with my wife’s permission) I spoke directly to her for a while last night trying to explain the position that I’m in. M was very understanding and non-accusitory, inviting me to attend my wife’s session with her next week.

I don’t know what to do.  My wife can’t STAND L, but doesn’t want me to drop the only therapist who I’ve had any success with.  I feel that a line has absolutely been crossed, and I don’t like the position that this has put in me in with my wife, but even M agrees that L is acting out of genuine concern for myself and for my son...who has, in fact, been negatively impacted by his mother’s behavior.

I’m giving very serious thought to dropping L and finding a new therapist, as I feel that L is encouraging a sort of adversarial position with my wife.  On the other hand, I’m wondering if I want to drop her for my *own* sake, or for my wife’s.  My wife agrees that this is a genuine concern, and is not encouraging me one way or the other.  I’ll be talking to L directly at my next appointment, a week away, but I’m not sure what I should do.  I’m also feeling guilty because, as I said, I really do think that L is really doing and saying what she thinks is best for me.

On the other hand, she can be very overbearing...and I know that she sometimes hears what she wants/expects to hear, so I don't know how reliable some of what she's relayed to me really is?

Does L’s behavior seem unprofessional to anyone else? At this point, I don't think that I'd feel entirely comfortable staying with her practice.  But yet....",11Aug2017,1,
31,"I need some help with not just my depression... but some advise with my family. 

I'm 17 and I've been living in London with my older sister (13 years apart) and her family since when I was 9 years old. The rest of my family lives in Shanghai, China and I only get to go back home during long holidays. I'm not bullied or anything at school right now and I have a close group of friends in both boarding house and during school time. 

The real concern for me is my family and especially my mother...

My mother is a successful business woman but has been in a huge amount of stress since the Fukushima earthquake in 2011, which caused her business to be in a downfall and she was bankrupt once. Her personality is really strong, forceful and stubborn. From what I've seen and experienced, my mother really likes being the boss in both her company and in her house... so it is really difficult to get close with her and talk to her... as she is quite the scary type. She also hates being alone and loves putting her stress and anger from her business on my sister and I, which causes a lot of verbal criticisms on us, fighting and tears. 

The biggest issue is that my mother does not listen to other's advises and she believes her decisions are always right, which makes it even more difficult to get close with her. She also doesn't care about the process of things being done and only cares for the result.... so for example if I get a good grade she will be happy but if I don't she will be mad and even told me to get of her car on a highway and called me a scum when I was 8 because I didn't get a good grade... (she doesn't spend time helping with my homework and she doesn't listen to my concerns, and rarely accepts my requests... I feel alone and frustrated most of the time in China as I don't have any close friends to hang out, so I'd rather stay at school and in London.

But it is impossible for me to stay in London during the holidays as my mother really wants us to go back. I feel a lot of sympathy for mother as she is not close with my father (although they live together, they are divorced), so she is often alone at home and has to carry all the financial problems and stress by herself, as I said before she also hates being alone. This is probably because she was badly treated by her mother and three brothers in her youth. And because I also hate seeing her alone as her child, I have to go back and spend time with her. 

However, whenever I go back, harsh words from her often  comes, and sometimes I even feel completely worthless and thought about suicide from an early age of 10 (at that time my sister didn't want me to stay in London because this means a huge burden on her, as she dislikes our mother and is quite a rebel at the time, also because of the language problems I was bullied at school. However even at that age, I knew that even if I talked about my issues with my family, they wouldn't bother or care, instead they will scold me to stop crying and be stronger... so I kept everything and suffering to myself and told not one. I disliked myself for a long time and felt like I had no family or friends so I thought only about how worthless and useless, thus thought about suicide and forcefully changed my personality in order to appeal tougher. Although I made friends but I also bullied others too, which I feel really guilty for afterwards. 

Then I went to a high school that no one from my school went in order to have a new start. But although I made new friends without harming others... my family is still the same and harsh words does not end. I continue even now to dislike myself whenever I meet my family as I feel completely worthless in front of them. I have no power to get out of my mothers control or become independent when I was young. However as I get older, I've  started to stay away from home by getting a job and travelling more. But I don't understand why I still feel guilty when I leave home and not spend time with my mother, but at the same time I'm frustrated, scared and sensitive when I'm at home. 

I really don't know what to do.... my mother has friends of course... but most of them are for financial benefits. She does have close friends but it is impossible for them to always hangout with them as my mother is busy with work and always alone when she goes back home... so I feel like I need to go back as my sister won't (she really hates my mum). But whenever I do go back, I feel mentally unwell and I feel like I'm being caged under her control. 

Please give me some advise on helping both my mother and myself...

32,"Hi, I'm not the good with these but here it goes.

I'm a 23 year old male from the US. I have never been diagnosed with anything, but have seen a therapist in the past for some anger issues I have that is a result from years of mental abuse from my mother.

Over the last few years I have noticed that I have a problem of overthinking any and all situations until i'm thinking about the worst possible outcome. Most of these thoughts are ridiculous and have no grounding to them at all, yet everyday I put myself into the worst possible mental state I possible can.

Unfortunately my family likes to mock and laugh at any and all mental illness, and when I try to talk to them about it I get told ""get over it"" or ""it's not that bad"".

Lately I have been unable to do most normal day to day functions because i'm so anxious I cant sit still or even focus on my work or hobbies. I am afraid that this will only get worse and lead me back down a path I never want to revisit.

Honestly just finding the words to type this out is really hard. 
I don't really know where to start but I want help. I hate feeling like i'm worthless and unwanted and I really just want this to stop.
My old therapist was found and referred to me by my aunt who is no longer with us (the only person who cared) and like I mentioned earlier the rest of my family thinks mental health and illness is a giant joke so asking them for help is out of the question. 

I'm sorry if this is badly written out. Its hard for me to fully focus on one thought. I just don't want to feel this way anymore and I don't know where to turn for help.

33,"My friend has been going though a really rough time these past few weeks especially. I'm gonna have to start at the beginning, around 2 years ago this friend started having just some hand seizures, that would happen pretty randomly. They got worse and they would happen while she was driving, holding food etc and her words would get slurred. During this time she started drinking and smoking pot. She was going to a therapist and psychologist for it but her condition got worse. Both told her that she needed to stop the drinking and drugs! I know that around this time she was also having suicidal thoughts.


Recently she's been losing her memory, the hand spasms haven't happened since I think about a year ago but now she will suddenly forget where she is and has even forgotten what year she's in or how old she is. Normally the forgotten memory comes when she is put into some kind of social situation that makes her anxious. For instance when we go out and get food or coffee whenever she gets up to talk to the cashier/ waiter she will completely forget where she is and what she wanted or what she is paying for. Her psychologist said it is due to stress and anxiety, mostly because of the fact that her parents have been considering getting a divorce. 


The most recent thing that happened was when she called me a couple of days ago. She was at work after being back from a 2 week medical leave. Seeming to be having a panic attack, she said to me that she was late for an AP Test. A test that we had taken 2-3 years ago in high school. I had to calm her down and say that she didn't have any test coming up that she had to worry about! I almost think it's some form of school stress related PTSD. She also, in a blink, did not know who here coworkers were and thought that they were going to hurt her.


I write this here because I'm wondering if anyone has seen or experienced something similar to this or thinks that she may need more help in some other form. Any thoughts or advice for me as a friend to her would be appreciated!",11Aug2017,3,

Although readership hasn't been too high, it's been much higher than expected.  I post every week on general topics and plan on doing some personal Q&A type stuff in the future.  I want to make sure that I'm writing about issues that people want to read rather than what I think they want to read. 

Whether you generally look at mental health blogs or not, what type of topics would you like to see addressed if you were a reader?

37,"My mother has had serious issues for as long as I can remember, and I attributed it to her and my father's poor communication skills. But I recently learned from a relative that both her father and brother were diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and I have very strong suspicions that she has it as well. I'm in no way trying to diagnose her myself, but given her family history and her behavior she needs help either way. Even if she doesn't specifically have bipolar disorder, she has dealt with severe menopause (although she was like this before she had it) and tends to bottle things up anyway. I've gently suggested she try therapy on a couple different occasions, but she denies it.

It's become increasingly pressing because I'm getting ready to move out, and I worry about leaving her with my father who has severe emphysema. She wouldn't intentionally hurt him, but getting in yelling matches or even the stress of dealing with her can cause him breathing problems, and she frequently brushes off his difficulty breathing.

An example: Today she and my father grabbed the wrong burger when we brought some wendys home. She quickly overreacted, yelled at my father for eating the wrong burger, I asked them both calmly to please stop yelling and calm down, and it turned into her screaming at the absolute top of lungs that everyone was ganging up on her, followed by listing all the stressful things she is dealing with in life (not being able to afford health insurance, work, etc.). She has outbursts like this fairly regularly, maybe once a month or so, give or take.

It could be her bottling things up, menopause, bipolar, no matter what it is she needs help and I don't know what to do.",11Aug2017,1,
