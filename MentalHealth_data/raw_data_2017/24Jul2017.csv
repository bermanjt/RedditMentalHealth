0,"Sometimes I'm on medication for my anxiety/ obsessive and impulsive tendencies/ implacable sense of dread.
Sometimes I'm not.
I believe I can be off medication and find ways to alter my brain chemistry through CBT, meditation, diet, sleep, lifestyle and functioning and feel like many people could do the same.

I also don't like the feeling of being on medication. It feels like some conspiracy and lots of people are being treated for things we can find other ways to cope with/solve. Or we're putting a band-aid on a greater social/cultural issue. 
Am I going crazy Illuminati/hippy overdrive here? Am I unjustly biased and should go live on a farm with goats and eat non-gmo kale all day while I talk about feelings? Why does medication bother me so much? Or do my ""vibes"" about medication hold merit?

2,"Recently, amongst some other mental health issues, I've been having bouts of really distressing existential thoughts. I'll be waiting for a train, or cooking food, or about to go to sleep (like right now) and it'll just hit me: one day, I am going to be staring death in the face. And then what? Everything I know will end. Everything. Blackness, nothingness, absence, I won't even be sentient to realise that it's all gone.

I imagine it as if it's happening right now, and I start panicking because I'm not ready. I've still got so much to do. But what if, when it eventually happens, I feel the same way? I want to be ready for it when it happens.

These thoughts aren't particularly depressive in nature, it's just about comprehending the concept of the end. It's so unfathomable and it scares the living (ha) shit out of me. If I think about it too much I get this awful feeling in the pit of my stomach.

Do you have any helpful words? Any advice? I'm really struggling with these thoughts hitting me at random times, usually when I'm idle.

Side note: I remember getting this feeling when I was reading the brilliant but incredibly morbid book John Dies At The End. There's a lot of really grim existential stuff in there and it freaked me the fuck out, gave me nightmares and is the only book to ever make me stop reading because I felt genuinely uncomfortable. Please tell me someone else has had this terrible feeling while reading this book.",24Jul2017,6

6,"Ever since I [31F] was a kid I've heard voices when I was in times of increased stress or anxiety.  They speak only to me and are in my voice. They speak one at a time, but in rapid succession. Examples of what they say are ""You are so ugly."" ""You are not worth the time."" ""People do not care or give two craps about you."" It is a constant flow of demeaning and negative thoughts.  I have never really talked to anyone about this.

7,"I am 30. What would be the cobtributing factors that high functioning autism would go undiagnosed? There is not a lot of information on the topic from what I could find.

And I like the diagnosis -- but is is also a problematic one. Autism is commonly manifested at about 2 years of age. I remember being -- fairly social right up until I turned about 10. That is, at least, when I started noticing that I was different. Many of the symptoms of high functioning ASD (obsession with topics, difficulty dealing with social cues, insensitivity in conversation) fit me very well.

8,my mom already has enough stress and i don't want to put her in any more by going to the hospital to get help. i've looked for group homes for mental health but those aren't common around where i am. i don't know what to do other than wait it out. ,24Jul2017,3
9,"So I have struggled with Body Focused Repetitive Behavior and ocd most of my life. I have still never seen professional help and have never been diagnosed. But I don't know what else it can be.

When I was in preschool it started with repeating words, counting steps from one door to another, having to clench my hands a specific way in order to open doors, and believing that if I didn't do something someone I loved would die (Specifically) In a car crash. This continued on into early elementary.

I Moved schools in 1st grade and began pulling my hair out until I was balding, had skin infections, and constantly going to the doctor. I was only 6 and dreaded going to school and would cry to stay home, I had to fix my hair a certain way to cover huge bald spots and was always stressed. 

The hair pulling continued on until 4th grade. I'm not sure how it stopped, something just clicked I guess. I wish I knew why.

By the time I got to 7th grade I no longer had thoughts of car crashes or counting steps.

Halfway through 8th grade I moved and a new compulsion started. This is why I believe it is do to stress or drastic change. It started within 4 weeks of moving. I found a spot on my leg and picked at it until it was the size of a baseball. Then it went to my shoulders, then my back, chest, legs, and finally all of my arms. I literally picked every single pore on my body. My clothes were always stained with blood. I had so many scabs and scars it almost all formed into one mottled mess. Some were huge too, some I would pick over and over for months and they would never heal.

Because I was so scarred, I started getting comments about being a druggie, a meth addict. People pointed and said hateful things that I just could not deal with. I have covered every inch of my body- Longsleeves, Pants, I cant wear my hair down because of scars on the back of my neck. Even when it's in the middle of summer. 

For over seven years I have not gone swimming, I cannot hangout on an impulse without having to cover up with makeup, every time someone asks me out I say no. It's gotten better, but it's not over. I've gone from picking 8+ hours a day to 1-2 hours. But these scars take years to fade and I keep adding more everyday. I thought maybe if I just don't think about it, something will click just like with the hair pulling- But it's been so long. It is unbearable, I am almost 21 years old and have missed out on so much.

I didn't go to prom, I was afraid to get a job because of the short sleeve uniforms, and so so much more.

I've had suicidal thoughts because of this, starting in 8th grade when it all started, and still now. Only they are worse. I used to always say that I only didn't want to exist, that I would never act on it, never hurt myself, because I was afraid to die. But This year is different and it scares me. These feelings come and go, but every time they return they are worse. The other week I cut into my arm with a knife just to get a taste of how painful it would be to kill myself with a knife. I'll be driving on the highway and just think how easy it would be just to turn the wheel and run of the road.

I want to get help, I really need help. I've told friends and family about my skin picking and my suicidal thoughts. But they don't take me seriously. They tell me to wait or to just stop. They don't understand this at all and I don't know if they ever will. I would help my self but I'm not sure I cannot afford help. I make $9 an hour, even with 10 hours overtime this week I'll just barely be able to make rent. On top of this I have a $300 speeding ticket for going 10 over, first ticket ever and I don't think they are going to let me off easy.

We have some community rehab centers that are pretty cheap  for help -around $50. But they are not all licensed specialists, very religious, and I'm not sure they would be much help. Literally every step of their OCD help thing has to do with believing in god. I am not a religious person so it doesn't help.

Does anyone have similar experiences? What kind of help can I afford if any?",24Jul2017,1

I've never really been to any doctors or anything of that sort, so I just wanted to know who I should contact about getting my mental health evaluated, I guess? Lol.

I've been experiencing worsening and new symptoms however, which is why I switched medications but I'm still having symptoms. I've been feeling increased loneliness and moodiness like I've never felt before and I don't know why. I was fine managing my mental health the way I was but it's like as soon as I get comfortable it has to pop back up again.

17,"With every situation, I jump to a conclusion in which the worst case scenario would happen to me. I don't know if it's because of the things going on around me or what, but I tend to do this without thinking.

I know that he wouldn't, but there's still that voice in the back of my mind saying ""But there's a chance he would."" I do this with everything (and most of the time, they are pretty extreme). 

I know I've never been an optimist, but I just feel like that if I expect the worst, then when it does happen I won't be surprised or as hurt. Can you tell me what's wrong with me, please?

19,"*I'm re-posting from a different sub because it wasn't getting any attention.

Please help me. One of my online friends has came to me about his depression and anxiety in the past and now hes coming to me about it again. I just want him to not feel like shit. Well today he broke up with his girlfriend that he had been with for 7 months. He has just been so sad and everything about it today, that's what triggered him talking to me. He said he doesn't have anyone else to talk to, I already told him to try to find a teacher, or school counselor, or someone and he says he cant trust them. He told me that last year or a couple years back, he popped a bunch of pills at school and went to the ER, and because the school counselors told his parents, he cant trust them now. He says he just goes to school and listens to music and doesn't connect to anyone. His home life is shit.. Is dad is an abusive alcoholic and his mom is a fine mother but it doesn't really seem like she does anything to stop it. His older brother just eggs everything on and causes arguments with him almost everyday. I asked him how long he was feeling sad for and he responded 9 months... He definitely has some sort of depression disorder, and also some sort of anxiety disorder. He tells me that he is always worrying and cant get it off his mind, and also cant trust anyone. He lives in the state of Colorado. Please help me, it means a lot.
Things that would help * Laws about school counselors telling parents about stuff they've talked about * Laws about seeing a therapist without his family knowing (and how he would do it) * Any suggestions on what I can say to him when he's talking to me

25,"Repost. This may be long but full disclosure of the situation is important to really understand how horrible the situation - I know not many people may read this due to the length but I will try to keep it as short as possible, I'm just hoping to get some advice on how to keep my family from breaking down/how we can collectively deal with my mom's behaviour as a family. Bear with me because this is the first time in my whole life I'v ever written this down or shared this with anyone.

I'm a 20 year old guy. Studying in university (medical school). I currently live and study in a city two hours away from my mom and younger brother who live in the capital city. We're from the UK.

I will try to condense the family history as much as possible because if I wrote it all out you would be here reading for days. My childhood was incredibly fucked up, unstable, abusive and downright miserable. My mother has always suffered from extreme paranoia, delusions and anger management issues, this also combined with extreme delusions of grandeur.

 I will give some examples of the kinds of behaviours she's always had:


When I was a kid she would change her phones/simcards once a week because she was convinced spies where monitoring her calls. She would throw away brand new televisions saying there were cameras inside. Cutting ties with long time friends or extended family saying they were conspiring against her/accusing them of being spies/saying she had bad dreams about them.


As a kid I never really comprehended the full extent of her mental illness, because my only concern was the physical and emotional abuse my brother and I both endured (physical beatings, screaming, verbal insults and abuse whenever she got mad). 


As I got older and into my teenage years I became more aware of just how severe the situation was, the first time I remember it really hitting me was when my mom called me and my brother downstairs one day (I was 13 at the time) and told us we would no longer be allowed to see or talk to our cousins (same age as us) anymore. We were very close to those cousins all throughout childhood. they came over to visit often and vice versa, and she just cut contact out of the blue because she decided she no longer trusted their dad (her step brother) and that was the last time we spoke to our cousins.

Should would also exhibit very abusive unstable behaviour, one day that same year after we got into an argument, she went outside to the garden packed literally bucket loads of dirt/mud came back into the house and threw it all over my room, smeared my bed, floor, table with mud and dirt. Sometimes she would leave the house with my brother and lock the kitchen door so that I wouldnt have any food. 

After I turned 14, i couldnt take it anymore and left home to live with my then estranged father (who I hadn't had contact with for over 6 years because she had practically kidnapped us to go abroad and banned us from having contact with him or his side of the family for years). He wasn't a much better parent, I lived with him for 2 years, in that time I endured extreme physical violence (choking me, punching me, throwing me against the wall).
I havent been unscathed in all this, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and still suffer from anxiety.

But it says a lot that I still preferred living with him over my mom right? with him I knew what to expect, it was pure physical abuse, batterings whenever he got mad. But with my mother it the emotional abuse was so unstable. At the point she could no longer physically abuse me anymore since I was bigger and defended myself, but the emotional abuse and batshit crazy behaviour made living with my father feel like a gift in comparison.


Finally my school became aware of the physical violence happening at home with dad after 2 suicide attempts, got police and local authority involved- my parents were taken to court and at the age of 16 I was taken into foster care, the local authority became my legal guardians and I remained in care until 19. (i'm technically still looked after by local authority since I'm still in education)

I wont talk much about my time in care, it wasn't always easy (move around from home to home) but it was a godsend. I'm so grateful because it changed my life. During my time in care, my relationship with my grandma became much closer. We would speak on the phone almost everyday and for the first time I was able to confide in her about my concerns with my mum in ways I'd never been able to do before. Before this, my relationship with my grandparents was always monitored and controlled by my mum. 


I should mention my mother doesn't have an ""official diagnosis"" of paranoid schizophrenia, I'v had to assign from my research into the DSM/ICD and i'm fairly certain this would be the ""official"" diagnosis had we been able to get her to agree to a psychiatric eval.


A key point here is my grandparents are very very wealthy (I honestly dont know the full extent but my grandma is a millionaire if not billionaire.) I admire my grandma so much, she had only a primary school education (parents were too poor to send her to secondary school) and she built her business from scratch into an international multimilliondollar business.

This is a key point because it provides context to a very important fact about my mother. My mom has never had a job in her entire life. She has never had to work for *anything*. Since she was in college she gets £6000 a month practically just ""pocket money"" from my grandma. When my mum was in her 20s, she worked for my grandma, helped with the business for some years and did good work for the company, but she stopped working for grandma after some years to do 'her own thing' - which was basically a constant stream of ill-thought and failed business plans that ended with millions of pounds wasted on stupid ideas.

My grandparents dont live in the same country as us which also an important factor. Its also why it took so long for the open dialogue about my mum's mental health to begin because my grandma just lived in denial for so long since she never got to experience the full extent first hand.

By the time I was 18 I explained to her just how severe my mums paranoia, delusions and abuse was. I told her about childhood, about all the things my mum did, about my fears about my mom (how she was isolating herself, my mum had me when she was 21 years old, she is a major extrovert and was always so popular. Now she has almost no friends in her life at all and no relationships) My mum's delusions also concerned me. My first christmas in foster care (when i was 16) my mum called and left me extremely abusive voicemails- i wont repeat the disgusting and horrible things she said. I recorded the voicemails and sent to police (who issued a warning to her). 

Two days later she completely denied ever having sent abuse.  i put it on loudspeaker AND PLAYED BACK THE RECORDINGS OF HER OWN VOICE and **she denied it and became convinced that the recording was fake. She accused social services of an elaborate plan to turn me against her by faking audio her voice to abuse me**. The thing is, this wasn't just some malicious lie- it was full on delusion, she believed what she was saying.

Anyway when I was 18 a few years later, another moment that really terrified me: I was still in foster care and by then my relationship with my mom had slowly rebuilt and gotten better - mainly because of my increased patience and understanding of her mental illnesses. We spoke on the phone regular. 
One day she calls me to tell me she'd met this guy 'Steve'. She was so happy, so genuinely happy and excited like a little girl. 


Every single day she would call me to gush about Steve, how sweet and romantic he was, how he'd taken her on a date, how she really thought he might be the one etc.

I cant stress enough how happy this made me. My mum has not dated anyone since my father (they were never married and seperated when I was born/had a weird hot/and cold relationship until i was 14). Its not due to any lack of suiters- i dont mean to sound weird by objectively my mother is a very attractive woman. She doesn't look her age at all (42) easily passes for early 30s/late 20s (she takes care of herself extremely well, has always been obsessed with taking care of her body etc). when we were in public together people always assume she is either my wife or my sister (awkward and annoying but flattering for her). 

So she has never had (and still doesnt) a shortage of men chasing her, but she had never pursued one single date or relationship with anyone until she met steve.

Over a two week period, she called me every day to tell me about Steve. I was elated, because i had become increasingly worried about her lack of friends/loneliness. I would actually look forward to these daily phone calls, she was like a little girl again.


Then suddenly one day, three weeks later she just called me out of the blue and said, exact words. ""I think Steve is a spy.""


I nearly broke down in tears over the phone. I didnt even say anything- when she reaches those conclusions the delusions are so severe theres no point trying to convince her. She told me she had blocked him/cut contact and that was the last time I ever heard about steve. 


This was the last straw for me, I called my grandma to tell her how scared I was of my moms mental health. I was so scared for her, I dont want my mom to end up alone and miserable. I dont even care about all the abuse I suffered, i'm just so fucked terrified to watch her mental health decline - it keeps me up at night and makes me go to bed crying. 

My grandma finally started to understand the situation. She started crying over the phone to me saying she blamed herself, how the signs of my mums mental health issues had always been there since my mom was a child but she never took it seriously enough. (bear in mind she's from a very conservative and religious culture where mental health support or knowledge was virtually nonexistent) So granda started putting in the effort to learn more about the mental health and we're working really hard to find a solution.

My grandma told me that 3 years ago she finally managed to convince mom to go to therapy for anger management and counselling. She said the next few weeks were some of the best she could remember, mom travelled back to home country to visit grandparents and it was like she'd changed like magic, she was happier, no longer fighting people, was in a good mood.
The things is my moms moods can change rapidly, sometimes you will speak to her and be on good terms, the next day she will call hurling abuse and accusations or starting a fight over literally nothing.

Anyway the good change didn't last long. She suddenly reverted back to old ways, becoming extremely abusive, picking fights for no reason, throwing offensive and crazy accusations at people. She also stopped therapy. She (my mom) said she was diagnosed with depression and they had offered her antidepressants but she became paranoid about side effects/started to accuse my grandma of wanting to mind control her with drugs. 

It was like one step forward too steps back. 


But the worst situation so far, the one that's really created chaos in the family is 3 years ago my mother developed a delusion and accused grandma of not being her real mother. 

The thing about these delusions is that for my mom they are very real. She would call me on the phone extremely distressed, crying, because her perception of reality is completely seperate from real life. 
No attempt to talk sense into her works. Both her and me/brother bear obvious physical traits inherited from grandma (nose shape etc) She even looks a lot like my grandma - yet she convinced herself it was all some elaborate cover up in her family and that grandma is not her real mother.

This obviously serious upset/angered grandma but with my help she was able to keep level headed and see the accusations for what they are- the result of severe mental illness, nothing more. 

But now 3 years later, the issue has still not been put to rest. When my mom develops a delusion its like a seed, it just keeps growing and growing. They will make up and be on good terms for a while, but an argument or fight will trigger the delusion again and she will call screaming on the phone about this childhood cover up. How my grandma once forgot her birth date, how grandma once forget her correct blood type, how grandma got angry and ""behaved weird"" when mom demanded a blood test- she uses this as evidence that grandma is not her real mom.

I'v tried everything, from logically explaining that her accusations are highly offensive and grandma's reactions dont = guilt, but the normal reaction of a mother who has raised and spoonfed you for 41 years being accused of not being the woman that gave birth to you.

I told her even if grandma wasn't biologically related (which is not case), why wouldn't you be grateful anyway that a woman who wasn't your biological mother took you as her own child and gave you the life you have now?
(mom was educated in private schools, lived a luxurious lifestyle, has never had to worry about money or food on the table).

Still mom wont listen, says the ""truth is all that matters"" - will not rest until my grandma does a blood test. grandma is refusing the test (understandably) - she told my mom ""to ahead and go and look for her real mother"".

I want to go over again how much I gratutide, respect and love I have towards my grandma. my family owe everything we have to her. After I left foster care she felt very guilty for everything i'd endured and not being able to support me sooner (limitations on contact put in place by mom) She started supporting me financially and was very proud when I got into med school (first in my family). She pays for my apartment so I never have to worry about rent.

She is a very patient, understanding and loving woman. She loves her family with all her heart. The issues with my mother make her unable to sleep or eat, she gets ill with worry and sadness.


Mom is not only child, she has only one other sibling (a younger brother who is late 30s) but he has never been as close to grandma as my mum- despite all the problems my mom and grandma have always had a very close albiet unstable relationship.


But she is reaching breaking point. AS WELL as the mother accusations, mom has always had extreme delusions of grandeur. she convinced herself that she is the sole reason for my grandma's success and billiondollar company (completely false and ridiculous/mad delusion) - she claims grandma is trying to cut her out of company ""she helped build"". Yes, while it is true my mother did work for grandma when she was in her 20s and definitely contributed, it was nowhere near the level of significance she now believes. Not to mention she hasn't worked for the company in decades, even though she still gets monthly 'salary'.

My mom is convinced of a conspiracy to discredit her, deny her of her inheritance and ties to the company etc - she has extreme jealousy and hatred and mistrust towards her brother (who has worked consistently for the company almost his entire life) this is one of things triggers that brought on the 'not my real mom' delusion.

Its true, I spoke to grandma and grandma is slowly cutting her out of the business but not out of maliciousness.  grandma LOVES my mother more than anything, but my mothers mental illness and complete lack of regard for hard work and thinking is a danger to the company. If my grandma were to leave the company to her, it would sink in a matter of years. 
Despite the luxurious childhood, my grandma tried and failed to instill a nature of working hard and earning your keep in my mother. As a result my mother grew up spoilt with a narcissistic personality and delusions of grandeur. 

*sigh* this has gotten too long already.

Long story short, mom called me on the phone two days ago. Very distressed, crying, angry. saying grandma (+ literally the entire extended family) cannot be trusted, grandma is not her real mom, she's not really related to us, they are all evil etc. I should mention now at the age of 21 my relationship with my mother is good - yes we still have issues, but ultimately i'v reached a point in my life where my understanding of her mental health and my love her trumps anything else. I let go of everything else she did. I love my family (brother, mom, grandparents) more than anything. They matter the most to me. 

So when I listen to these delusions on the phone, when she cries or screams or shouts. I no longer argue or fight with her, I listen calmly (truthfully sometimes I will mute the phone speaker for a few minutes because she just tends to the scream) just to allow her to rant and ""get it all out"" uninterrupted. I listen to her, make her feel validated (but not encouraging the delusions) and try to discuss it with her calmly. But at this point I realise there's no discussing away these sorts of delusions. 

We need help. We need professional help and we dont know where to begin. 
Aside from getting the help, I just need some advice on how to manage this as a family, how to remain patient and understanding.

She was very upset on the phone, I told her I would call my grandma and speak to her. I did, called her immediately after and spoke to grandma for over an hour on the phone. Recently grandma has had less and less patience for mom (who can blame her) i have to be the diffuser, I spoke to grandma - reminded her calmly that we cant give up on my mom. ""I know its hard, but a few years ago we were on opposite sides of this phone call"" (when I went into care I hated my mum, cut contact completely, wanted nothing to do with her, grandma would call me every day telling me not to cut her off, reminding my me 'its just how she is- dont take it too seriously). So now I'm the one calling my grandma to say the same thing. 

Grandma listened to me, sighed and said she knows. She'll never give up or cut off my mom but its just..hard, you know? We spoke about it for a long time, and my grandma said we must get help and come to a solution, because as a family we cant keep putting up with my moms behaviour unchecked. 
We do our best, but we also need effort put in from my moms side in the form of getting help, therapy, counceslling whatever.

My grandma doesnt mind paying, she doesnt care how much it costs, but my mom needs to get treated. Now she's considering options of finding a way to get my mom forcibly treated if she doesn't agree to to go herself.
(i know there are ways for this, for family to get help for someone that wont get it otherwise) but i'm worried of it causing further distress to mom or worsening symptoms and paranoia if she feels everyone is conspiring against her forcing her to go to hospital. Even though we're trying to help, she may perceive it as kidnapping or something.

I want whatver help we get to have an element of being voluntary for mom - but i dont know how high the chances of that are.

I also dont want my grandma to cut my mom off from the business completely, because I think that hurts mom more than anything else and is one of the triggers of the 'not my real mom delusion' - its not about the money, to my mom, being cut out is more symbolic - its not really to do with money (since she never has to worry about that, she still gets her 'salary' (pocket money). I was hoping to discuss with my grandma some better alternatives, such as putting limitations or proving my mother with clear ultimatums.

its her financially reckless behaviour that concerns grandma. My grandma said my mom is really intelligent, when she used to work for the company she was very smart, really helped and made a significant contribution. but its her mental health and delusions of grandeur problems worsened and made my mom unable to work with anyone. She said my mom could be doing so well right now, the business is booming and my mother could be thriving if not for her unstable behaviour.

Since my mother will no undoubtedly also develop delusions about my grandma bribing a therapist or influencing her treatment in some way, I was also thinking of suggesting giving my mom the choice to find any therapist (anywhere Europe or US), my mom chooses the therapist and she doesn't have to provide the name or address of who she chooses to see. Grandma will pay for it as long as she has some kind of proof mom is receiving the therapy (confirmation from me or some verifiable receipts for the payments.)

As for the more pressing issue about my mom denying my grandma is real mom, I cant see any solution to this. This delusion is creating chaos in the family. I want to sit down and convince grandma to just get it over with it and do the test (of course we all know she is our real grandma). you have to understand how real these delusions are for my mom. Until she seens physical dna evidence she will never be able to move past it. But grandma has been refusing.

*sigh*
sorry this got so long. I'v just been dealing with is all on my own and have no one else to talk to. 

Since grandparents live in a different country, its all done through me, i'm the liaison - i have to arrange everything- do the research, find therapists.
not just for mom but also for my brother (who has gaming addiction), grandparents are worried about him/so am I - I'm worrying every day trying to make sure he's happy, help with his social life, and i need to help him find a counsellor he can speak to so grandparents can fund therapy/counselling sessions.


 I'm exhausted but I'm not remotely resentful or unwilling to have these responsibilities. I'v accepted, family comes first for me and I love and care about my family more than anything else. Over the years many people, therapists included have told me it shouldnt be my responsibility, its not fair to me. but my family dynamic is something most people will never understand, i just cant give up on them. I want to get the help needed for my mom but i dont know how.

26,"I want to start out by saying that I am not close to my family so I am not really grieving losses here but, I just found out that my last remaining uncle died in march. I'm not sure if he committed suicide or drank himself to death, but whatever it was was self inflicted. So at this point I'm the last of my line so to speak. My great-grandparents and grandparents are dead, and now every member of my mothers generation has either committed suicide (2/3), or attempted it multiple times, and is likely to succeed at some point (1/3). 

Now my family aren't good people. Not evil in the classical sense but deeply ill and very toxic. I haven't had really any contact with them for a long time for reasons I won't go into here, but learning that my uncle has died has illuminated a pattern in my family history and I just want off that train. 

I like to think that I am better than they are and have *tried* to be better than they were, but I find myself struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts in my own life. I have no family and few friends, and I'm currently going through a pretty rough time in my life with no support.

I'm not gonna bullshit you here, I am posting this for sympathy/support reasons. But I am also looking for strategies to cope without resorting to what has become a ""Family Solution""

27,"I know this may be hard to understand,but last year and the year before that I used to have those random rushes of happiness quite often, it was honestly the best period of my life. Along with those rushes of euphoria, I also had those episodes that felt like panic attacks. This may sound super strange, but ever since my parents bought me a laptop, I had more of those panic attacks. After a while (about a day or two) I stopped experiencing said over-happiness and panic attacks and I now feel like a emotionless rock. Those emotions never impacted my life negatively, I still am achieving well in school, it just made me feel full of life and I want to experience it again.

I can't do that to my mom it would break her heart if I did. The last time I went through this I had a plan but no intention of doing it. I'm like that right now. I have the same plan as before.

33,"Hi, first time posting on reddit, hoping someone here can give me some advice.

I've been struggling with feelings of sadness and anxiety. I had crying episodes followed by physical pain mainly in my chest area which lasted for several hours day after day. I don't know what triggers these episodes. 
This has been going on for the last six months on and off. Currently is not as bad as it was four months ago when all I would do is cry, unable to concentrate on my daily assignments. Now I can go through the day but then all of a sudden when I'm alone I get very sad and start crying. Usually it happens at the end of the day. 
I suspected it was caused by high stress levels and lack of sleep. But even when there is no stressful situations or I had enough sleep I would still get sad. 
Lately I wake up very anxious like there is some exam happening that day or something else where high performance is expected. 
I definitely don't know how to relax anymore and I think that I'm under a lot of stress daily but unable to recognize it or even pin point reason which causes it. 
Quite often I feel like I can't breathe deep enough and my heart beets very fast. 
I also noticed that I'm not pleased with anything that I do and lack confidence. 

I have finally decided to seek help, but in my country healthcare system is very sluggish and it will be at least a month before I can get an appointment with a therapist.

Is there anyone here that deals with a similar problem, and what are some good tips one can do to cope with a problem like mine. All inputs are welcomed",24Jul2017,6

**AUTHORS:** Mark Eckblad and Loren J Chapman

**PURPOSE:** To measure magical thinking.

**DESCRIPTION:** This 30 item instrument was designed to measure the magical ideations characteristic of schizotypal disorders.  The MIS is also considered a general measure of a proneness to psychosis.  Magical ideation is defined as the belief in what general Western culture would consider invalid causation, such as clairvoyance, telepathy, superstitiousness, and so on.  The focus of the MIS is not on the credibility of these forms of causation, but the respondent's personal beliefs and experiences.

**NORMS:** The MIS has normative data from a total of 1512 undergraduate college students.  The mean score was 8.56 with a standard deviation of 5.24 for males (n=658).   Females (n=830) have a mean of 9.69 with a standard deviation of 5.93.

**SCORING:** Respondents indicate whether the item is true or false regarding their personal experience.  Items 7, 12, 13, 16, 18, 22, 23 are scored 1 if answered false.  All other items are scored 1 if answered true.  Total scores range from 0 to 30.  Higher scores reflect more reported experiences of magical ideation.

**RELIABILITY:**  The MIS has good internal consistency, with correlations of 0.82 and 0.85 for males and females respectively.  Data on stability were not available.

**VALIDITY:**  The items of the MIS were first judged as to whether or not they were congruent with a specified definition of magical ideation; this represents logical content validity.  The instrument then went through several revisions in order to make certain it was not associated with social desirability and an acquiescence response set.  Concurrent validity is supported with correlations between scores on the MIS and measures of perceptual aberration, physical anhedonism, and psychoticism.  Known-groups validity was evident with differences on psychotic and psychotic-like symptoms for subject whose MIS scores were two standard deviations above the mean and a control group.

46,"I used to believe in magic, I think it was a coping mechanism of loneliness, I used to cast spells and have a diary of my magical encounters, i wanted to belong to something and not be the norm so I adopted an idea that i controlled a demon inside of me to fulfil that need - this was all as an early teen mind you, during these times I used to see faces in everything and talk to voices except in my mind I knew that they where not voices they where only my thoughts so I knew I wasn't going psychotic I was feeding an idea. I know that it is not real, though sometimes i believe it may be. the point i'm making is that I'm not delusional, I'm 21 now and I've grown out of that fairy tale, there was times after the magic bullshit I started becoming paranoid, feeling my parents where spitting in my food, that the reason I had poor eyesight was too see aura that flows around us, this was after the magic stuff but I know in my heart that this stuff isnt real, I use logic to dispel my imagination. Ands thats just it im so logical that I know this stuff isnt real so it is not delusions it's paranoia and imagination, again a few years ago around the time I was so paranoid I broke off everyone in my life including family and started to develop an anxiety disorder and indulged in damaging behaviour to fill a void, so looking for some semblance I started beleiving in many religions, and now I know that none exist but I dont know what I believe now it's all changed so much i've no sense of my actual beliefs, and again I knew that this was simply fake, so that means I can not be delusional! fast forward to now years after my magical lies and now though sometimes i see things, ghosts, figures standing over my bed, aliens shooting into the river to collect water and shoot back up to the sky, the other month I seen a flat black box in the sky that was like some sort of 4 Dimensional figure the collapsed in on itself and never existed but it did i seen it, It was like when a computer monitor goes off and the image collapsed in on itself it was like a 'pointy cube' I sometimes feel like flies are tiny probes, that cats are cctv cameras, that the home I live in is some sort of psycho experiment and much more, I've no sense of identity and i'm scared for my well being.

I find that whenever I try any kind of psychological technique I just end up getting extremely agitated.

I start getting obsessed with thought modification and the whole thing about neuro plasticity and wonder how come when I change my thoughts nothing happens and my mood remains the exact same. Theoretically, changing thoughts should lead to a change in mood but because it doesn't it creates so much agitation. Then theres mindfulness which creates so much agitation because it doesn't do anything for symptomatic relief either.

Ever since I've been lonely but I have a sinking like unending boredom to which I can't seem to satisfy. Had a date went south which is fine I don't mind, but it got me thinking.
 I'm only 23 but I've had constant relationships spanning over 3 years since I was twelve. Early bloomer I guess, this stopped at 21 when my fiancé left me after I got assaulted. I thought that I loved her but I looked back shortly after and realised that I was purely attached to her. I'm unsure if I have the capability to love, purely from analysing my past experiences, maybe I'm thinking to much. It's like I have one side of me which is dead on the inside, literally no feeling, I wouldn't say I was depressed anymore but I just feel nothing, that said It seems to cloud my mind and just isn't me, then on the other side i feel like I've been made gentler, I have very little to speak about anymore but I've found myself being more empathetic to others, yesterday I gave my favourite coat to a homeless man to sit on, everyone I was with didn't understand but I just felt he needed it. This is confusing the hell out of me one side feels nothing the other side feels everything. I don't know if I'm waking up or if the world is affecting me, I feel like I've started to see more in terms of the badness in the world and I feel like it's dragging me down to such a extent that I just want to fade, I will not kill myself, I have tried more than once and began to no longer see the point in that either, I'm lost, bored and a mere husk of the person I once was.

I am a 29 y/o gay male who has been diagnosed with both avoidant and dependent personality disorders. Ive had the diagnosis for a while, am undergoing therapy, am medicated, and can cope quite well normally. 

Thing is, I've recently began dating a wonderful guy. Dating is new to me, my mental state prevented me from being able to until recently (therapy is amazing!)

I know, obviously, that mental health isn't that cut and dry, but I'm hoping I can get some ideas that will help me develop ways to keep my negative habits at bay.

With my last relationship, I tried to be very cognizant and self aware and still ran into trouble. Since I really like this person I've started dating, I'm terrified I'm going to let my disorders win out, so I'm looking for any information that might provide some guidance in the hopes it will help.

58,"Hello, I've had a rough ride.  

I originally started to seek treatment in university, I knew that my depressive and anxiety symptoms were getting worse and I wanted to get help before I reached my bottom.  In hindsight, I now see the care I received wasn't good despite the therapist I was seeing being a good person.  I saw them for years, and I never even had a treatment plan.

 
Without a treatment plan, I just kept on getting worse and worse, I dropped out of school, was living in a metaphorical dumpster (trash everywhere), wasn't socializing, and my anxiety and depression was through the roof.  I didn't know what to do, and was confused at why I was still falling despite committing 100% to therapy.  My therapist also didn't really know what to do with me, and she sent me to a specialized hospital in Towson, MD for better help.  Where I was living was a small town with about a dozen and a half traffic lights, there wasn't many resources and I went through all my options there without getting help.  It made sense at the time to move to Towson after my hospital visit.  It seemed like there would be more options for better care there.  I know this was a mistake, and in truth, if I had all my faculties available to me, I wouldn't have moved here.   

In Towson I received very bad care under an unethical psychiatrist.  When I say 'bad care' I don't think I'm being subjective either.  One of the staff at the mental hospital slept with me and the head psychiatrist constantly bashed providers who weren't connected to his practice in some way while promoting himself as the expert in trauma (and to be fair, if what the hospital told me was true, he was a world renowned expert).  I did try reporting the staff member (the one that slept with me) to the hospital after I was discharged, and the staff was fired.  I felt like I was gaslighted while I was at the hospital, and I needed to heal.  The head psychiatrist who was either complacent, or indifferent in what happened continued to see me as an outpatient.  Again, because of his impressive credentials, I thought that I shouldn't leave him and instead find a therapist (not one that I saw at the hospital) to work through the emotional trauma I experienced there, help heal my relationship with the psychiatrist, and then we could move on with the care. 
 
After searching for a while, I wasn't finding a qualified therapist that could see me on my insurance.  So, out of desperation, I turned to the head psychiatrist for help.  A slight side note, I've tried discussing my complaints about my care with him in the past (including the previously mentioned staff member) but he has always been very dismissive and sometimes hostile.  He has cussed at me, told me I received the 'best care,' threatened me that if I sought out help from the legal system that no one would side with me because of all the biases Judge's have against the mentally ill, told me I was 'too poor to receive help,'  told me 'no one wants to work with me,' and has consistently tried to belittle the bad experiences I've had there while taking no responsibility for what happened.  I'd have dropped him if I could find a replacement, but I haven't been able too.  Eventually he got me a therapist... that was his employee.  

 At first I was happy to finally have been getting help... but then I saw the therapist and she had some frightening behaviors.  In my first session, I asked her if she could keep are sessions private from the psychiatrist until I'm ready to bring up my experiences with him again.  She told me she would look into it.  Turns out she didn't look so much into how to keep my information private but more into how she could share my information without my consent.  The next session she brought a legal argument with her, sighting some case in maryland which sets a precedent allowing her to share my information without my consent.  I was shocked.  When I expressed my concern she gave me three options, drop the psychiatrist and find a new one before seeing her (but she was unclear if this meant she wouldn't share my information with the bad psychiatrist in this case (because said psychiatrist is technically her boss)), continue seeing her and give her full permission to share information freely with said psychiatrist, or find someone else to work with.  

After being hurt by the hospital for so long, I think I need to drop both the psychiatrist and therapist.  So I started searching again.  Most of the results that pop up through my insurances website are people who have a connection to the bad hospital.  The ones who aren't first question to me is about my recent mental health care history.  When I tell them of my recent troubles they don't really want to work with me, and I don't blame them.  

So this is where I'm at, I was so hurt by the hospital and my years of unsuccessful therapeutic treatment that I no longer have the blind faith that I used to have in therapist/psychiatrist.  But I'm not functioning, I am poor and soon to be homeless, and I know that I need help.  So, I'm still looking for therapist and psychiatrist because I don't know where to find help anywhere else.  But, when I reach out to others in the community they don't want anything to do with my case.  

What am I supposed to do when my most recent trauma was from the psychiatrist/psychological community which was supposed to help me?  It seems like the industry is set up to help clients with trauma from external sources and not internal.  I don't know where to go, I feel untreatable, I'm scared to death of my near future, what can I do? ",24Jul2017,2
61,"Trigger warning.
 I really don't know what to do anymore. My partner and I have been in an online relationship for a long time now. She's struggled with an eating disorder since before I knew her. She was hospitalised for it and still has lasting damage due to the amount of weight she lost. She almost died. Recently, over the last month's I've noticed symptoms coming back. She isn't eating anymore. And she is constantly talking about her being fat as well as how much weight shes losing (she lost 2lbs in 2 days and cried because it wasn't enough) I've tried to talk to her about it in several ways. I've made sure to try and be kind and caring in whatever I do. The last thing I want is to upset her in any way but she's started denying that she even has a problem. She will just say things like ""I don't have a problem, im just fat"" or ""I'm dealing with this on my own. I don't need to gain weight, im fat already"". To be honest it terrifies me. I understand that I can't be her sole form of help and I know there isn't some miracle answer out there. Im scared she will die. The changes to her body in the last month are really scaring me.

65,"Over the past few weeks, I've noticed big changes in my own behaviour and really don't know what to do.  I've tried to pin point a life event that may have caused this, but really nothing significant has changed from my perspective

Something minor might go wrong - or my mind might interpret it in a way that makes me believe that something has, and then suddenly that's all that's in my mind.  Sometimes, it's not even that something has happened - it's what might have happened.  If nothing came out of it at the time, I still worry about what could happen down the line (and in a number of cases, I know logically nothing will come of it but the element of doubt still seems to take over)

I find myself struggling to sleep - usually because the worry takes over and I start thinking everything through.  I've also been having some pretty horrible dreams - the other night, it was that my nephew had been kidnapped.

I'm also completely unmotivated at the moment.  I wake up and go to work, but am easily distracted and shying away from a lot of things.  I've never been the most confident person, but over the past few weeks I have regressed when I was making good progress previously.  When I'm in a meeting, I'm pretty much the silent one, doing the minimum and only responding when asked a question.  And everything seems to be moving at a much slower pace.

When I am able to successfully distract myself, things seem great and I'm OK.  But this is only temporary - the worry creeps in a takes over again eventually.  I've tried repeating the events I worry about in my head, and I can see how ridiculous a lot sound, but it never really seems to go away

I've been trying to make a GP appointment lately to try and discuss things with them, and finally managed to get one...in 2 weeks time (there are things the NHS is great for - getting a scheduled appointment is not one of them).

The white on other hand was demanding me to do more righteous things and motivation, (it sounds like comic) but always the Ashy one dominates over the White voice. Now. Today it slowly formed into 1 voice and I don't know if I even can be schizophrenic at my age but I'm seeking some explanation of these. Is hearing voices quite normal at my age?

This might sound weird and it's a long post, but I need to get this off my chest / ask for opinions. I've told my therapist about it the other day, the first time I ever talked about it to anyone and she was very concerned, which is rare for her...

Beforehand, I'm an extremely empathic person and I would never harm anyone.
So: when I was 16 I started self harming because of various reasons, it would start with a few shallow scratches but soon got way worse, to a point where I would cut down to the bone, needed stitches nearly every day and couldn't think of anything else.

The problem is, after a while the self harm wasn't linked to negative emotions or distress anymore and I realized that it was more of a fascination with harm itself than a ""way of coping"" or anything. While I was aware that other people see it as disturbing and abnormal, I found it to be completely reasonable and not bad at all. I would mutilate myself simply because to me it was beautiful, I loved the sight of blood and flesh and huge scars. I would eventually stop because I was admitted to several psych wards, but I still thought about it all the time and searched for serious wounds and mutilations online, the worse the better.

That would stop as well though and while I haven't done that in quite some time, I recently relapsed and cut my hand pretty badly. Again, I didn't see it as a bad thing, I wasn't feeling down or anything, I just missed it so much and I loved it. The people around me however weren't happy about it at all and I decided to talk to my therapist about it. We kinda went into it and searched for the origin of that rather morbid mindset and thinking about it I remembered that I always had extremely violent fantasies, even as a kid I would lie awake at night for hours and fantasize about getting tortured and mutilated. And kids should probably not have these thoughts. It got to a point where I was obsessed with thinking about killing my mother because we had an extremely troubled relationship and I nearly went through with it at one point (I didn't though, don't worry).

now the thing my therapist finds alarming is the fact that I don't feel empathy in these situations, neither thinking about other people's deaths, nor while hurting myself. Again, normally I'm super empathic, I'll start crying as soon as I see people cry, I want to comfort everyone and make sure that everyone's okay. Only when it comes to violent fantasies I don't mind at all. Now of course I'm 100% aware that these are only fantasies and I would never ever harm anyone except myself in real life, but still, my thoughts and feelings on that topic seem to be odd. Also now that I recently relapsed and got to remember how much I love it, the urge has gotten way bigger again, which probably isn't the best either..

I don't even know where I'm going with this, I just wanted to talk about it. Is it really that bad/worrying? I'm scared to tell my friends about it because I'm afraid they'll be creeped out, I tried to mention parts of it in a jokey kinda way here and there (like, we worked with a fretsaw the other day and I said something along the lines of ""I kinda wanna put my finger into that haha"" and from their looks I could tell it was a bit too much, but these just are the thoughts that pop into my head on a regular, completely normal basis).

Idk, can anyone relate? Or tell me what it is / where I can find similar people to talk to? I don't think I'm a masochist, since I don't enjoy the pain but I simply love the sight of blood and flesh and find wounds (especially on myself) fascinating...",24Jul2017,1
74,"For as long as I can remember there has been a battle inside me between what I want and what I know to be the things I should be or do. There has been so much pain within me. The values and desires I have dont match my reality. My desire to be a better person is sharply contrasted by my lack of self-control and discipline and its tearing me apart. I dont know what to do, help.",24Jul2017,1
75,"I've never really understood the want to hurt yourself intentionally until now. I feel inconsolably upset. I've been out to play a gig at a cocktail bar. Cried on the train there. Cried there. Cried on the way back, and have been crying vehemently in my room since I got back. Most of it is because the girl I'm seeing was meant to come tonight, but for some reason in the pit of my stomach I knew she'd cancel, and I kept waking up with dread the night before with this feeling. It was confirmed in the morning. Why is it that only the bad dreams come true?
We had a date yesterday, generally went okay bar for a 5 minute spat where she was speaking, someone walked past and said hi to me, I said hi back, missed the end of what she said because someone randomly appeared and I replied to them as they greeted me. Couldn't really be helped. On top of this, she got a bit annoyed that I wasn't talking about myself; to which I explained I'm not going to unless questions are asked, which I would duly reply to. This was interjected with something to the likes of ""You can just randomly bring up things about yourself"". Fair enough, but with conditioning myself that no one cares about what I say generally (insert years-long backstory), and that that's hard to comprehend someone wants to listen to what I want to say, it's a toughie. I did explain so. Only lasted around 5 minutes, but it was pretty awkward, and we both said so. 

Why is there such a struggle between wanting to tell someone about your anxiety and depression to allow them to be somewhat conscientious of it, and by having told them it'll scare them off because who really wants to deal with that?

Things have been different since with talking online. Very apparent on my end. She's very much less excited to talk to me; leaving it 6 hours after having finished work, giving a half-assed reply before going to bed whereas usually it would be a wonderful paragraph-and-a-half about her day and a general reply to what was being spoken about/answered by me in the previous message. 

We spoke about ""What is your biggest fear"" yesterday, and mine was being alone. Since university has ended friends have moved back home. I ditched my old group of friends that I had for the duration of it as they're admittedly not getting anywhere in life; spending all their money on drugs and the majority either failed or dropped out along the way. Not the best crowd to surround myself with. I don't speak to my family. It truly feels as if I don't have anyone to talk to. The friends that I see on occasion always seem to direct the conversation back to them if I try to bring up anything about myself, and it's not as if I'm not enquiring about them. I guess it was slightly wrong of me to put this girl on a pedestal, but it's hard not to when the connection was there straight away. I don't want this to be the downfall of it, and if it is, I feel as if it's completely my undoing of it. And I'll beat myself up over that. 

I don't really know what I'm getting at here, but typing things out have helped. I know this started off with the implication of wanting to hurt myself but I think I'm past that. I just need.. someone to listen, and there's no friends I have to do so, so the ambiguous entity that is Reddit will have to do. ",24Jul2017,1
76,"Hello reddit, First of all let me apologize in advance for any mistakes I make as this is the first time I'm personally posting something on reddit. So the title is a bit cryptic, I know. Let me explain. So it all began a year ago, I was just a day out with my then girlfriend now ex, and saw that she was texting on her phone a lot, and I got really curious but then I thought to myself she gives me a lot of privacy so why don't I do the same thing to her? And this continued to happen for a few weeks until she gave me her phone to see something and then she was getting messages from this guy, now I'm no idiot, when a guy chats up your girl in 2 in the morning shit is serious. But I decided to wait it out to see how deep things actually are, and I didn't confront her about it. Then later her sister (who was a VERY close friend to me at the time) gave me my girlfriend's Facebook password and I started reading the messages, and well, it was what I thought. Then yeah I got mad, but, things happen right? So I decided to have a talk with her then asked her if she had been talking to anyone else. Her exact words were ""I haven't talked to anybody whether you believe it or not"" and this is where it all began. I was fucking destroyed and let down by the person I loved and thought that loved me back. But that's not the point of this. The point is I was let down by someone who I trusted so I cut her off. Skip to 3 months later. School begins, new people better times for me. Made a lot of friends, chatted with a lot of girls and was happy. But I would see the flaw in everybody I met. People were so rude, they would talk about one another behind their backs and they would spread rumors. And being me, I thought: Well, they aren't nice people and they most certainly do it to you too. So I cut them off, by cutting off I mean 0 talking and 0 looking, NADA, like they weren't even there. Some time passes and I started talking to this guy who was a year younger and we became good friends. And one day he was criticizing me for not being a good friend and how I didn't know what respect was, all this because I was not talking to him because I was helping my best friend with some trouble (she is a girl), and so I told him: ""Look, if I'm not the friend you want to have, nobody is stopping you from leaving and not talking to me again."". And he said there wasn't any need for such a thing, but, being the motherfucker that he was, he started talking behind my back, so I cut him off too. A simple ""If it's a problem for you to talk to me you can just fuck off"". So this happened more times. And man, people are some motherfuckers, liars, backstabbers and fucking thieves. So all the ""friends"" I had, I had to do the right thing and cut them off. I was stronger at the time and thought I didn't need them, and I didn't. Time passes and here I am. Literally 2 friends my best friend mentioned earlier, a classmate and my new girlfriend. I've cut everybody from my life because I knew that they would destroy my life the minute I gave them the chance. And now, I think I destroyed it myself. Of course I won't forgive all the lies and all the words behind my back. I don't think I deserve it, but they do deserve being cut off because I don't need people who can betray me. And so, here we are today, I'm alone. Nobody to discuss it with, I feel lonely but I am in no way willing to introduce those people back in my life. Now I'm sitting here in my bed, wondering how it all came to this, me being alone after cutting everybody off.
And as I was writing this, I just cut off my classmate because he told a girl that I used to talk to, a few words I shared with him about how she told me she loved me. I told him just 4 hours earlier and already what I told him it's known. Fucking betrayed by my close friend. So I had to cut him off too. My best friend is living her happy life and has a boyfriend of her own and we talk less than usual. So the only person I got is my girlfriend who asks me to give people second chances but I don't trust them enough.
So look at me reddit. I lonely, I love a girl who can't understand me, and I am losing my last friend. Is this normal or is something wrong with me?",24Jul2017,1
