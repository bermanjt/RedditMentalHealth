5,"So, I've been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder from many medical professionals and am wondering what is considered dissociation associated with that diagnosis, what could possibly mean a more significant diagnosis, or maybe I'm not dissociating at all. 

I have five examples of different times I think I may have dissociated (I'm not really sure of the true meaning of dissociation I'm just going off what my doctors have told me) 

1.) When I was working at a local bakery/cafe I would be in charge of restocking and cleaning the dining room. The job itself was not particularly stressful for me, however being in the crowds of people was. I was really paranoid at the time constantly thinking about what people were thinking of me (like how disgusting I was, how lazy I was, or how they could possibly plan to hurt me). Majority of the time I would be stuck in these thoughts, but some days I would kinda sorta be on autopilot and it would be similar to watching someone play a first person shooter. While this was going on I would have elaborate conversations with myself in my head.  

2.) My most recent hospitalization I was in a ward with about five other people. The psychiatrists would come to see us in the morning some time around 9-12. My first night I was there I went to bed around 6 pm almost directly after dinner. I slept like a rock without any dreams (which is really strange for me) and then woke up to being mid conversation with this psychiatrist. Apparently we had been talking for a little while because we were getting into some deep stuff. I didn't want to be thought of as more of a freak than I already am so I never told him what had happened. 

3.) the next day into the same hospitalization I get up around 7 am and hang out in my room unable to go back to bed so I just doodle and read. The time passes by really quickly and just like that it's lunch time! After I eat I call my parent telling them that I did not meet with the psychiatrist that day and was confused why not. She calls the unit office and they send a nurse to tell me that I did in fact speak with the psychiatrist. I denied her claim so she went and got the psychiatrist to come into my room to tell me that I did see them. Telling me that I had promised to never self harm or hurt myself in any way in the future and that I demanded to get released that day.. Two things I would never say. 

4.) Today I got my nails done at a local spa. The ladies there were very sweet Chinese women who do a great job. This never stops me from becoming extremely paranoid (on how they are talking about me, trying to poison me with the chemicals they use, and judging me on my appearance) While sitting in the chair getting my gel manicure done I would phase in and out of reality usually coming back to the lady doing my nails saying that I need to relax my fingers (I guess they go really tense when I'm anxious) this is different from my time at the bakery because in this state I am not even thinking the world just stops and I can no longer hear anything or feel anything. 

5.) I change who I am everyday. Sometimes even halfway through the day when something stressful happens my mind shifts and I deal and think about life in a completely different way. It's starting to become annoying as I come to understand how much I'm changing. I can't keep a stable career path nor a solid friend group because every day I am one of my 12 heads. And there is no rhyme or reason which one I awake with. I hope that makes sense. 

Dang, I was not expecting this to be that long..  thanks to all who read all of that. Please leave a response if you have any idea what these situations and problems could be caused by.. if it's anxiety, BPD, or maybe something else. Thanks in advance! ",08Jul2017,1
7,"So this guy was a smart dude. A really smart guy. But sometime last month he had a psychotic episode with schizophrenic symptoms. This was his first episode but apparently these symptoms and delusions had existed for years and he was just good at hiding or rationalizing them. So first I'm beating myself up for not catching these symptoms and signs but now He's been telling me that his boyfriend that I've never met and he were in a fight recently. While he was in the hospital i got his ""boyfriend's"" Facebook info and texted him. Turns out this poor dude has never been together with my friend. My friend harasses him all the time. He has some kind of app that can change his number no matter how many times this guy blocks him. He has gone to his house and had the police called on him and was chased out by a gun. I don't know what to do with this. I don't know how to tell him to leave this guy alone.",08Jul2017,2

11,"I'm not sure what to expect out of this post, but just typing it out could be therapeutic.  My son, ill call him Adam, has had issues of various types for several years.  He is 20 and has never kept a job for longer than 2 weeks.  Typically, he gets his first paycheck and takes off for several days to a week.  These days are typically drug benders with his friends. Weed, alcohol, pills, acid, on rare occasions meth, just whatever is available. During this time he is fired for not showing up, and he will refuse to look for another job for months after.  He refuses to do anything around the house without getting paid, he comes home high everyday, and refuses to abide by any house rules (dont come home after 12am, dont smoke in the house, dont drink in the house, etc...). 

Occasionally, he will mess up to such a degree that it is unavoidable, for instance, stealing and hiding the goods in the house.  Then when pressed on it he will blow up and yell and say its none of our business what he does and if we dont back down, then he says he is going to kill himself and goes to a police station to be admitted.  He has done this 4 times.  All 4 times he has been discharged in 72 hours or less, and they give him a low dosage of an antidepressant which he refuses to take.  But it is my belief he does this just so we will allow him to do whatever he wants. Once he is out, he is right back with his friends getting high and doing the exact same things he was doing before.  Every time he has been admitted it has been because he was being forced to deal with something or take responsibility in some way. How am I supposed to deal with this?  He refuses to change, there is no family we can send him with, if we kick him out he will couch surf with friends then end up in a mental hospital again. His mother refuses to allow him to be homeless and so he continues doing whatever he wants and I am powerless to stop him.

13,"Let me begin in saying what I am discussing is in the past now, sort of. I have been abused in my life, a lot of sexual abuse, and physical too. So I have always been a little fucked in the head, even from my early childhood. When I was 12 I got my first device that accessed the internet and found a lot of weird shit, naturally. Now, I've always been obsessive, but I never before, nor since, have been obsessed on the level I was on one of the things I found on the internet. As I was(and am) a brony, I delved into the fandom, and found the fan made character Pinkamena. I don't know why, but she became my everything. Pinkamena, since you probably don't know, is a fictional serial killer, who tortures mutilates and eats her victims. I never have really understood why I was drawn to her, I just was. As time progressed I made as much in my life center around her as I could. I started watching and reading content that featured her exclusively, often choosing to do this in place of other things I enjoyed, in school, anywhere I could. Originally I sort of identified with the emo versions of her, as things in my life weren't going great. Somewhere along the line my grasp on reality loosened, and I fell, really, in love with her. Naturally the problem with that is two fold:One, she's not real, and two, even if she was, she was a horrid sadistic sociopath, how could she ever feel anything back? I twisted that in my mind to,""How could she ever love me?"" and so forth until it became,""She could never love something as worthless as me."" as my self esteem turned to self loathing. I was functioning OK for a while, until I was 13 and came to the conclusion that I was worthless unless I was a masochist, because in some stories she is involved with a masochist. So I decided I was a masochist, and even now I am. I started self harming with often and in anyway I could. Kitchen knives and a lot other things like that. I also used to bite my knuckle on my right hand really hard when I was stressed, it felt really good, but I stopped because a teacher saw I did it in math class. I found a razor which cut more smoothly, and easier, and deeper. I started self harming with pictures of Pinkamena on my laptop googled, and then it became a need for more dedication to her. So I started carving her name in myself, over and over. I was so high from it, and it made me feel close in a way I can't be any other way because she isn't real. I started getting carried away, and people started to notice when my legs became so consumed with fresh cuts that I couldn't explain them all away. At the same time I began drinking, and from the moment I had my first sip, it became the only thing that ever compared to self harm. I fell deeper in the rabbit hole, as you can expect, and became depressed, and suicidal. Somewhere in the summer I turned 14 I got the idea stuck in my head of mutilating and killing myself. The masochist in her stories had scars all over her face and body, I decided I would emulate them, and in order to kill myself the way Pinkamena would kill me, I wanted to do her signature. Her signature happened to be disembowelment. One day in October that year I just decided to do it, but my razor was lost. I ended up stealing a bottle of 50 percent alcohol rum from my mom's liquor cabinet making a drunken fool of myself, and breaking into a condemned house and getting lost, so drunk I started being unable to stand. They found me, and I admitted to trying to kill myself, which I had intended to do, and was put in a clinic. I've since been doing better, and while I've had masochistic urges, but now I've figured out how to deal with it, and avoid Pinkamena entirely. So even though I'm healthy now, do I send like I'm mentally ill? And this comment isn't going to get investigated is it?",08Jul2017,2

16,"My mom has a phrase she always says when I tell her I'm depressed. ""This too shall pass"". I fucking hate that phrase. I know it'll pass, but it always comes back. Always.

I am what my doctor calls a ""rapid cycler"". Although I'm not technically bipolar (I have schizoaffective disorder, a mix of schizophrenia and bipolar). I had somewhat control over my illness when I was a teenager, even though I still ended up in the hospital once or twice a year. When I turned 18, everything changed, and I don't know why. I started having depressive episodes at random, where there used to be a pattern. Since I turned 18, I've been in the hospital upwards of 20 times. I'm 22. For a while, around when I turned 20, a new pattern formed. A depressive episode every three months, followed by a month long manic episode, then normal for a month, and then I'd start sliding again. Every time I ended up in the hospital. When I was 21 I was admitted to my provincial psychiatric hospital for 4 months. I thought it helped. It did not. Along with suicidal thoughts and self harm, I started having homicidal thoughts. Everyone I saw, from total strangers to people I loved, I wanted to cause endless pain to. To torture them until they screamed for mercy, and died sobbing for help. Obviously, I ended up back in my local psych ward. Now there's no pattern anymore. I can't track my lows and highs, and it seems I'm never ""normal"". I'm either depressed, manic, or so anxious I can't even face my roommates. All I want to do is cut myself until I bleed the pain away. My mom says I'm doing better, that I've found better coping mechanisms. That's not true. I've just found other bad coping mechanisms. I hide in my room, sleep all day, stay up all night, and scream into my pillow until I'm hoarse. I desperately want to die, because I know I'll never be able to lead a normal, functional life like this. I am a leech off society. I live in a group home for the mentally ill, and survive off of social assistance because I can't hold down a job because I end up having a breakdown and quitting after three months when I inevitably end up back in the hospital. How am I supposed to live like that? It's not even living, all I'm doing right now is surviving, and I'm tired of it. I'd rather die than survive another day. My life is hopeless. I'll never achieve the things I dreamed and hoped for, because mental illness has ruined my life, and I don't want to live anymore. ",08Jul2017,36
17,"Sorry for the length. Half venting, half looking for advice.

I'm afraid of looking into professional help, for a few reasons. First, I'm scared of opening up to people. Even just deciding to reach out here makes me anxious, but I'm really at a loss right now. Second, to get help, I'd need to go through my family first. This is the main reason, because I don't know how to, I don't want to be a burden and worry them (my parents constantly work overtime to support us, my siblings are busy with their own careers/education), and I'm not sure it's even serious enough to prioritize getting help for.

I'm suicidal, but I don't ever intend to go through with suicide, because I don't want to make any people close to me sad and have my family deal with paying for a funeral. I've been dealing with suicidal feelings for about 6 years, and I've still managed to survive despite it, keeping these things in mind.

I tried to say something once, but it didn't work out (was told to just find a hobby/look on the bright side)  and I can't say that hasn't had a negative effect on my decision to keep to myself. I'm really bad at verbalizing, and I easily cry. I've been trying to keep a journal, but even writing down feelings makes me feel ashamed and uncomfortable, so I started avoiding even that, but I should probably try again.

I've been afraid of reaching out since I was a kid. I worked everything out by myself. I go through extreme lengths just to avoid asking someone something/bothering them. I'm also restless all the time, even when nothing is wrong, something feels wrong.

There's times when I'm in a good mood, and times when it's hard getting out of bed, but the shame of being unproductive keeps me from staying there forever(+my dog that needs to go outside). When I'm at my worst, I think about how it's hopeless, how I can't open up and talk to anyone, that people are investing their time and feelings into someone that just wants to die. I get intense urges to self harm, but I've managed to avoid it so far out of fear (scars, going overboard and going to the ER, etc.). I have a difficult time with close relationships, I feel like I can't really form a bond with anyone, because I end up avoiding/retracting, out of fear that they'll realize I'm actually awful and annoying. Since I'm close to only a handful of people, I actually feel really clingy, but I never act on it and instead externally seem really distant. It's easier for me to detach. During my lows I end up deciding to isolate and cut myself off from everyone. (Doesn't really work out when someone initiates conversation and I need to respond)

No matter how bad I feel, I still push myself to at least do the bare minimum for functioning and socializing, for fear of making things worse.

When I get really depressed, I feel desperate for help. When I'm not, I think I can put off getting help. It's been a constant loop trying to decide what to do.

So... that's generally how it's been. The reason I've been inclined to reach out lately is... I want to stop just researching mental health things and get direct help. I really really want to avoid self-diagnosing, but I admit that I relate strongly to some medical labels and sometimes look for coping methods that way. Also, I've come to realize that I'm unable to wholly live and be a person like this. It's hard to be a decent friend and to be as outgoing as I'd want to. It's been making me real frustrated and sad lately. But honestly I'm kind of amazed I even feel that way, because I used to be so obsessed with dying that I wouldn't think about how to live at all. I guess it's just hit me.

**tl;dr**, feel anxious all the time, suicidal, scared of people/opening up, but I've been able to just barely manage it for years. Things honestly aren't as severe as they *could* be. Unsure if I should pursue professional help asap, or hold off a while longer and keep trying to survive by myself, at least until I'm in a better &amp; less stressful position (money+family-wise). 
Also I guess, I want to ask if anyone has any advice on what I could do right now to help myself/improve?",08Jul2017,2
22,"I will preface this by giving some background:

I'm a 20 year old male college student. I was always one of the best students in school, I played sports, I was fairly popular, and had a lot of acquaintances (this word choice is important) in elementary, middle, and high school. Essentially, I was (and still am on the outside) a model kid. The one that the other kid's parents look at and say ""You should be like him."" (Okay, maybe  don't say it that way cause it sounds very blunt and rude, but you get the idea). I never drank, smoked, did drugs, or did anything illegal because it was just wrong to me.

Starting in the 7th grade I started experiencing a bad flare of insomnia, accompanied by incredibly vivid nightmares with pain that felt real. Fast forward to now and I'm still having them, and also the insomnia. 

I feel as though I'm at a breaking point. It never used to be this bad or painful. Especially now, since I have lost contact with nearly all of those people I knew in school, Im not playing sports, and on a day to day basis, I hate myself.

I'm at a point where I have such little regard for myself that I question if my standards are even worth having anymore. It get awful thoughts sometimes about doing horrible things to people, most of them are without warning and I don't ever think about them before or after, just a heafty spur of the moment urge that I am able to quell. But enforcing that self-declination is getting harder and harder. 

I want to get so drunk that I can't feel anything or comprehend anything all the time... bur I never do because I am the model ""and it's wrong"".

My school is getting harder and harder to keep up with (even though I enjoy the subject matter) to the point that I consider dropping out, despite having a 3.8 GPA. 

I'm exhausted all the time, I don't care to maintain relationships, and I would rather not talk to anyone, despite being someone who craves intimacy (romance, not sex).

There are so many things that I want to write in here, though all of them would be troublesome to read in one sitting.

Positive advice is welcome, I will attempt to add additional information if you all have questions. Thank you everyone.

23,"My girlfriend continues to feel suicidal on a daily basis.  Some days she doesn't even mention it, other days she is lost in a world where all she wants is to die.  Diagnoses include bipolar 2 and C-PTSD.  The last few days have been particularly hard because she has been at me with the following statements: 

* ""You don't want to be with me!"" 
* ""It's too hard for you to sympathize with me!"" 
* ""You don't even care!"" 
* ""It doesn't matter how I feel!""
* ""When I'm upset, you don't care!"" 
* ""I'm just an annoyance to you!  Just something you have to deal with!"" 
* ""You get angry when I'm sad!"" 
* ""You don't want me here!"" 

And then when I disagree, there is the inevitable

* ""You just want to tell me I'm wrong for feeling how I'm feeling!""

Aaahhhh it's maddening!  I spend **so much time** laying in bed with her quietly holding her while she cries, coaxing her out of bed to come outside with me, generally making sacrifices to be there for her as much as I possibly can.  But when she starts in on this line of accusations, I get so *angry* because she completely forgets all the time I spend trying to help her, like all that effort is gone from her memory (because at those times I'm there with her, her mind is in a swirl of total agony) and thus my efforts don't feel like they matter because she insists they didn't happen. 

What the hell do I do?  Do I need to keep a damn log of the time I spend helping her through her darkest times, of the therapeutic things I manage to help her through?  We don't have money to go to a therapist, so I'm reading book after book learning how to understand and help her and she's reading when she can and going through DBT modules that sometimes seem to help.

25,"Hi everyone.
We're a family from India. I'm a 20 yo guy, and my sister is 23. She graduated law school last year, to start preparing to become a judge in court.
Let me give you some context beforehand. My parents had an arranged marriage, and belonged to rather different families. Mom came from a well educated family. Dad was the only highly-educated member of his. The sole breadwinner. He's a highly intelligent, and rather paranoid man. He also has a pretty huge ego, given the circumstances that he grew up in. This has manifested itself multiple times in the past 25 years of their marriage, and almost resulted in divorce a couple of years ago.

Anyhow, Dad was always a rather hard taskmaster with my sister, about her studies. He also used to taunt her on occasion. In her final year of school, she was juggling schoolwork, law preparation and Dad's ego. As a result, she didn't get into the law school she wanted to. More damage to her self esteem. Nevertheless, 5 years of law school did improve that a bit, but not enough.

Since then though, she has never been able to move on. To his credit, Dad has tried to improve his behaviour.
Lately, she has lost all motivation to study. She is stuck in an endless loop of procrastination and self pity. She isn't in touch with any friends, and tends to break down every once a while. 

Before suggesting a therapist, please understand that in India finding a good therapist is pretty difficult.  She's been to 3, 2 of which have actually caused more harm than good. She tries to share with my mom and me a lot, but I have the emotional depth of a teaspoon. Mom can't give any new advice, other than the same ""meet your friends"", ""improve your physical health"" and so on.

I need help pulling her out of this.

35,"Hello everyone. Let me start by saying I have never experienced anxiety in my life (currently 23 years old). I've struggled with depression on and off for most of my life (however lately I've been feeling a lot better) but never had any anxiety. In fact, the complete opposite, when I'm depressed I couldn't really give a shit about anything. Anyways, I had my first panic attack at the beginning of June while on a 10 hour road trip back home from Chicago. It was probably three in the morning and I stopped at Starbucks to get a cup of coffee and after drinking that, I began to have the panic attack. It's hard to describe, but it felt almost as if I was tripping without having taken any drugs. It felt a lot like the come up on a psychedelic drug such as acid (which I haven't taken in years and have zero plans to take again after this has been happening) when you start to feel like you're slipping out of your body. Visually nothing was really different but it almost felt like my brain and my body were not connected. A better way to describe this I guess is that I felt like I was going to pass out, but not ACTUALLY pass out if that makes any sense. Like at any moment I might lose consciousness even though I know in the back of my mind that I'm not actually going to pass out. So then I started to freak out about the thought of passing out and of course my heart was racing, my hands and feet felt very tight, and I just sort of felt like I was going to die. I pulled over, continued having the full blown attack for probably 30-45 minutes and then got back on the road and still didn't quite feel right for the next few days. I assumed that I had just drank way too much caffeine for it being 3 in the morning, and having driven 10 hours to Chicago a few days before and then 10 hours back had just taken quite the toll on my body. So I brushed it off as a caffeine and stress related incident. Then tonight I had a second panic attack for no reason at all. This time I had consumed probably four iced teas at work (felt totally fine at the time) and as soon as I got off work and started to drive home, started feeling the same panic setting in. I got home, continued to have the same symptoms as before (feeling like I'm going to pass it, feeling like my body and brain aren't connected, weird vision even though I really can't explain that part, my vision just felt off). Now I'm assuming because both incidents involved me drinking caffeine before, that caffeine might be triggering the anxiety. However, I drink caffeine every day and I've had these incidents randomly, months apart. So my question is, is what I'm having actually a panic attack, or could it be something more serious? For the most part I've heard people describe panic attacks as them feeling extremely nervous for no reason, however, I don't feel ""nervous"", I feel like something strange is happening in my body that I can't quite describe, like I'm going to pass out or something, and that of course then makes me nervous. One thing that does give me actual known anxiety is flying on airplanes but that feels nothing like this. That anxiety feels like knots in my stomach and I want to throw up. Nothing like tripping or feeling like I'm going to pass out at all....which is why I'm wondering if these are even panic attacks that I'm having. 

Does anybody else get anxiety that feels like this? Or should I see a doctor because that doesn't really sound like anxiety? Either way I really can't afford that, especially if it involves running expensive tests and I'm not interested in any prescription medication if it is anxiety. However if I've got something else that can be treated then obviously I'd need to do that. First thing I'll try is reducing caffeine intake and seeing if that works. Thanks in advance for any information. ",08Jul2017,2

I feel kind of agitated too, and I'll just start jumping around or making really weird movements over and over. Starting to think I might be going crazy. ",08Jul2017,4
39,"Hello, relevant personal facts: Bipolar I, OCD, PTSD (non-military). Every experience I've had in CBT and even DBT has been disappointing. A therapy student I know mentioned that it could be because I am too intelligent for it -- like I see what the therapist or any of these activities are getting at, and so it's like going through the motions. Honestly, it's kind of demeaning and I get bored.

Is there any sort of therapy that relies heavily on intellectual analysis? Or something else that isn't perfectly transparent, at least?

Thank you!

EDIT: Downvotes? Really? I'm not calling you stupid if you think CBT works for you. This is merely a situation of me holding a laser pointer for my cat and him just standing still and looking at my hand, knowing the game. That's all. Be helpful or don't.",08Jul2017,1

41,"From California, US,

I'm such a mess right now. I'm crying cause I have a write up to do from college, which is really problematic because I have to be in a /perfect/ headspace to do anything that requires effort. I'm missing out on a concert right now, which is also killing me because I feel bad wasting my friend's money (although she always buys a bunch of tickets cause it's a charity), and cause I (kinda) enjoy it. I don't really want to go though cause every time I listen to music, I get really serene, and have vibes that I could be really at peace with my death. It's not exactly suicidal but I feel super comfortable with the though of dying at these times, apart from all the horrible effects on my loved ones and what I need to give to the world. I get concerned though.
All of these things aside, I'm actually great right now. I'm finally on an antidepressant after my old psychiatrist fucked me up in a way. I'm doing great in school and I can actually do my work most of the time, unless something I didn't plan for myself comes up. I love college, too, it's so nice and I love being there, I don't feel miserable. The problem is really that I have yet to graduate from /my/ highschool. I know I can get a GED, and I only have like 2 classes to take cause I missed a few months for mental health reasons. I can take those courses at a college and get them on my transcript or I can take them online at worst, but I don't know how I can recieve a diploma unless I'm a (full time) student of (Beverly Hills) high school. You might be wondering why I won't/can't take the other options. I'd get a GED but I hear mixed opinions on going into graduate education/careers with one, and I could take those courses online, but then I wouldn't get a BHHS diploma (I believe)? I've been in the school district my whole life cause my parents wanted me in a safe school district, and graduating from BHHS would be better than some random high school. I'd feel awful not doing it because we've probably spent a (few) hundred thousand to stay in the district and it's been such a horrible struggle to go to waste. All these years of bullying, it used to be just emotional but since middle school it became physical and sexual, but I said we've spent too much money to just switch school. I can't go back, not after seeing how successful, happy, and useful I can be in a college environment, because it's structured in a way that doesn't make me come home at night and just lay in bed. I'm not forced to be exposed to things that destroy my mental health for a period of time. I was really struggling in high school too, I don't know if I'd pass if I went back, or if I wouldn't be able to function again (I met my new psychiatrist a month before finals, and if it wasn't for the meds kicking in, I wouldn't have been able to get out of bed. I was waking up and struggling to stay present in class, that was fixed, but my willpower has been the same since finals. I managed to study and do relatively well on my finals even though I wasn't really ""there"" in my classes for a while, the will to do well isn't much higher but it goes so much farther outside of high school.)

I really wish I could talk to a counselor right now, but my counselor disappears off the face of the earth as soon as school is over and now all of the counselors have left their posts. I'd wanna know what my options are for getting a diploma without setting foot on campus, and if there's any extra paths I could take with a mental health plan from the school. Otherwise I may end up breaking my heart just to keep my sanity.

Edit: I know about the CHSPE (I meant this as opposed to a GED) but would still like a normal diploma.

I'm mostly asking ""does the school keep me enrolled over the summer, so I could still be considered a student rn so I can get credits over the summer however I can and then graduate?""

I have no problem getting a high school degree, I could get one online no problem, it's just getting it from that school that's the issue.",08Jul2017,2
42,"So, I've had a rough life. Grew up poor, no parents, raised by an abusive and alcoholic grandmother. Tried to get myself a better life, went to culinary school, but had to drop a year later. I had 15k+ in debt and fell into a deep depression. I drowned myself in gaming and then I met the person that would become the driving force of my life for the next five years. However, this person was in fact, psychologically and mentally abusive. I just never realized that. I was blind and stupidly in love with a man-child. He ended things almost nine months ago. He ended them badly and he gaslighted me to the point I was questioning my sanity for months. He had me convinced for years that I was a bitch and abusive towards him and treated him badly, and disrespected him (yet he never supported me during my darkest moments, he flirted with girls behind my back and when I was double whammied by diabetes and a near death experience with armed robbery at my job, he only treated me worse and refused to be there for me). Yes, I'm certain I wasn't perfect either. I have my demons but I overcame all and so much more on my own.

I find myself here now, independent, paying my own rent and bills and taking care of my furbaby. He left my life for good (and I say good because I'm making sure he has no way of ever contacting me again) a month ago because he enlisted for the military (most likely to please his father since he's still so attached to them and dependent on them--they're wealthy as well; and I realized a while back that I wouldn't have been marrying him this year as planned. I would have been marrying his parents as well). My friends who witnessed how he treated me, humiliated me, and treated me like a mat, say he has his karma headed his way and I'm certain too. But whatever it is, I don't care. I'm trying to heal. I'm trying to push forward but I sit here, finally properly grieving since he is no longer around to torment me about his next sexual conquest or his online girlfriends he got right after he ended things with me (I had no way of leaving and moving on my own at the time). I sit here, crying my heart out realizing that I loved him with all of me, truly loved him yet he never did and it's throwing me into a pit of depression. But depression in the sense of not wanting to die because I don't want to live. Depression in the sense that I want to die so I won't feel the heartache. 

I've been going out a little more and wherever I go, I'm reminded of him and I have to fight back the lump in my throat that threatens to choke me and feeling like my heart is going to burst from the anguish. I still fight the cognitive dissonance he created in me over the years. I was always so sure of myself and my gut was always right. Red flags went off in the beginning but he went past my alarms and hijacked me in a way. And fell head over heels for him. Gave him my innocence and now I can't even function sexually without the thought of something dark and sadistic. (And yes, he did rape me once but not fully, more of vengeance because he was tired of not getting off because I couldn't function sexually from my diabetes). And I also used to be a cutter and pain was my drug. And he fed into it even more, and I'm trying to fight that away to. I find myself getting anxious more often and feeling like I'm going to have breakdowns. I'm at a loss as to what to do and I feel like no one else will really support me because I've already vented so much to them for several months.",08Jul2017,5
44,"I remember being depressed as early as 12 years old (I'm now 22), but recently my parents have said they noticed symptoms as early as 7 years old. I've been on medications for the last 5 years and have tried every tablet the doc could throw at me. I've had CBT, well over 20 sessions but to no avail. I've recently stopped CBT as well as completely cut out antidepressants, I was just wondering if anyone knows of any other treatments? The ones I've had haven't even put a dent in the problem for me.",08Jul2017,1
45,"Hey guys,
I am a gay teenager and I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and the one person I feel comfortable speaking my mind with is also somebody who I have had a crush on for years (he knows about my feelings but thinks they're a thing of the past). Obviously being able to speak to him is the best thing but also whenever we finish chatting or whenever I leave having seen him in person I always am hit with a particularly bad wave of depression. Just wondering if anybody had any opinion on what would be the best thing for me to do: break contact with him because of the serious negative effect he has on my mental health or stay friendly, be able to continue talking to him about anything and everything and pretend nothing is wrong??

46,"Hello fellow redditors,

Mainly posting this to see if anyone else has gone through something similar before I take more drastic measures.

I'm taking zoloft to treat my anxiety and depression. It's been pretty great in stabilizing my moods but hasn't helped my anxiety, so my psychiatrist has been putting me on various mood stabilizers (along with the zoloft). First it was lamictal, then it was abilify, and the last one which I also stopped taking was seroquel. 

They all gave me weird side effects, but after taking a very small dose of seroquel for only a week, I started feeling a weird sensation/pressure in my head, which a few days later turned into a migraine. It's not a full blown migraine any more, but it doesn't feel like a normal headache.

It's now a week and a half since I stopped taking the seroquel and my head hasn't gone back to feeling normal, and if it does it's only for a few hours. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this with seroquel or other mood stabilizers. I'm not sure if my head needs extra time to get back to normal or if it's something more serious and I should get it checked out. Any feedback is much appreciated!",08Jul2017,4
48,"I'm not sure what to do but I am having a hard time telling my dreams from reality there are times where I need to stop in a conversation and think ""Did this really happen."" before continuing. I do fairly well in day to day life but its becoming harder and harder to know whats up from down, I'd talk to my girlfriend about it but I'd rather talk to strangers its easier to talk to people I don't know, and I don't want to worry her anymore than I already do.

To put things into perspective this started a years ago when I was working at a factory, I would hear people say my name that weren't saying my name, I would see people walk by that didn't walk by. I put this all up to ""Its just factory things."" but now its becoming almost a daily thing, when I'm alone I tend to hear things over my music and see things from the corners of my eye, like a quick movement here, louder than normal shuffling from behind me. I can't explain these away when it happens in our house. 

Just last night I had a dream that was so life like that I was trapped in it, even though I knew deep down that something was missing, something was off, my mind just couldn't place it. I woke up crying but I wasn't fully awake, like my brain was fighting the reality and wanted to stay in the fantasy even as my GF beat on my arm and chest I had to fight off my own mind to come to her. I want help, I can't afford medical help or anything that requires hospital treatments..I don't know, I don't want to sleep again I don't want to lose everything I have here.",08Jul2017,3
