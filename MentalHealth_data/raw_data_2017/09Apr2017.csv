1,"I live in the US. I wrote this a while earlier. Posting this because i need to get it off my chest. Help?


This all started in the fall. I used to be a social, simple minded, not very smart, like everyone else I was around. I was ""normal."" I had a history with drug abuse, except it was very minuscule. Last year I got caught smoking marijuana, but I had not touched any substances until this one particular night. School had been stressing me. It was hard to cope. A dear friend of mine offered me some Ritalin to assist my studies, so I took it. It felt amazing, as if I were a god. I got all my work done and the euphoria was immense. I had fallen asleep at around 10:00, after finishing all my work. I had taken the pill at 7:00. Here is where the problems start. I woke up. I felt very strange, a very uneasy feeling. I was looking around and suddenly, a terrifying thought crept up onto me. The thought that I was in a dream, and nothing was real. I had overdosed. I panicked, unsure of what to do. I screamed, I shouted, and everyone rushed to me. 

I couldnt explain myself. I would look manic. 
The day went on. 

I went to my classes, but I had been devastated by the thought. I cried countless hours. I had lost all hope. It crippled me and stayed along with me for a few days. Until, I found ""salvation."" I researched and found what potentially could be wrong with me , and it ""seemed"" like DPDR. 

I talked to some people, and they referred me to a philosophy called Solipsism. it was the thing i had always feared, that everything was in my head. it crippled me and i began to lose control of things, with the idea that it wouldn't matter in the long run. It ruined me. I cut off ties with many people, and I gave up in my academics. 

Until I got into hacking and coding.

As a 13 year old boy (yes thats my current age), computers were a huge part of my life. Gaming was my favorite thing in the world, and I would alwasy skype my friends and we would have a great time. Everything was dandy, until I stumbled apon hacking. Now, hacking is a gross word. It makes me cringe like hell. I started with small things that did absolutely nothing. I would ping minecraft servers with the intent of DDoSing them, I was easily the cringiest being one could possibly be. After time, I realized I was a complete joke. I learned absolutely nothing. Until I installed Linux. Using linux got me super familiar with computers. I started with Ubuntu and I learned tremendous amounts. My growth was exponential. I learned HTML, and I was happy again. Back like the other kids, simple minded, not quite self aware and very social. 

That did not last long.

I got bored of Ubuntu, and I actually wanted to become a ""hacker."" I booted up Kali linux, after days of reading and watching guides, I became proficient. Using ettercap for DNS spoofing and ApacheWebServer to host my phishing site, I had become as powerful as I had ever wanted. I had harvested half my whole schools passwords, and it felt great. 
Except one thing.
Such a great power, I felt like a god. I spent more and more time on my computer, and I changed as a person. I felt disconnected from normal social interaction. Let me elaborate on this. I lost many emotions I used to have. Sympathy, empathy. All I wielded (and still do) is apathy. I would have people constantly coming up to me, sobbing, explaining there problems. Their parents dying, a break up, dead grandparent, I have heard it all. Except I could not connect. I was completely emotionless (still am), and I did not care. Now, people had still thought of me of who I used to be. A nice, friendly, funny, trustworthy kid. I exploited my past in a negative manner. Hacking had never been so easy. I betrayed everyone with them completely deceived, with no suspicion. 
I valued myself over everyone. My IQ scored 138, I deemed myself as superior and greater than everyone. I had nothing holding me back. No emotions to make me aware of myself, and nobody to notice. 
Except one problem.
The more intellegent I became, the less sane.
I developed personality disorders. I have became unsure of who I am.
Myself and a friend installed arch linux, and the more computer time, the more smart, the less sane. 

Now we are up to date.

I have two main moods. No, that is not the term. 
Two  people living inside me.

One of which, is cruel, manipulative, sociopath-like, ambitious, dangerous. He impairs me of doing the right things. I say me assuming he is not who I really am, although he takes control of me for most of my day. He pities my other ""being."" He perceives anyone more intelligent is a threat, and can get aggressive. Feels no emotion. Once he  found out about his grandfather being diagnosed with terminal cancer, and he will die, he didnt care. Nothing matters to him. Only his strength. He uses people, and only talks to people when he needs something. He is unaware of his current state when he is ""awake."" He laughs at terrible things, dark things, and he is trying to take over at all times. I am writing this post right now, trying to fight him off. He is telling me that making this thread is stupid and there is nothing wrong with me. He laughs and pities others suffering, he has very little patience and tolerance for incompetence. He is cruel, loves watching others suffering and cares nothing about others.

The other one is who is writing right now. I am sincere, loving, smart, but still emotionless in social situations. I am self conscious and a critical thinker. I contemplate decisions before I proceed, and drugs seem like a terrible idea. I am very weak but my only strength would be my intelligence and will to be aided. I have very complex and intriguing thoughts, but I still keep the idealism that I am superior over many. I pity those who are like who I was. This goes for both beings. Simple minded freaks, they disgust me. My other being will not let me reach out for help.

I only have one friend where my both sides can get along with. He is a genius himself. I can not read through him like the others. I deem him as competent while greater than myself as a being. I am scared of him in a sense. Someone nearly as intelligent as himself scares me. I get the feeling that he poses a threat to me, or hes out to get me. People whom I can deem as greater than I freak me out. Maybe they look down onto me like I look down onto other people.


These emotions change rapidly and my cruel being can become very dangerous. 
I am an extremely paranoid person.
Whenever I am in my manic being, I feel as if nothing is wrong.
I am aware when the other one is in control.
The other one will not allow me to get help.


Please help me

7,"Hi everyone, new around these parts. I have a rocky relationship with my parents, and it's been this way for a pretty long time. At least since my freshman year of high school. I am a sophomore in college now and every time I come home from school, I end up in a fight with them which can result in me getting disgustingly angry at them (swearing, behaving outside of my normal self). Then it turns into a vicious cycle of just constant yelling and crying on my part. Usually I'm collected, even when people piss me off I try and do a pretty good job at controlling my anger and frustration. 

I'm home this weekend and today has been rough, lots of yelling and fighting. Whenever I'm here I feel so helpless and like I'm not good enough and won't ever be good enough and unwanted. I feel so much better when I'm gone and not talking to my parents. Honestly it's sad because I want to love my parents and be normal like everyone else but the more this keeps happening, the more I want to cut them out of my life completely. Can't really do that though because I'm almost entirely financially dependent on them and also because I don't like the thought of it even though it would make me happiest, I guess. I don't think that's the right word for it.

Again, I feel wonderful whenever I'm at school: plenty of caring friends and all that. I work at my college newspaper though, so I don't get a lot of time to really focus on academics/sleep/exercise. I do my best to eat right but sometimes I indulge in stuff I wouldn't normally -- mainly social eating-type circumstances, though last year I did struggle with binge eating. That's mostly under control.

I guess my question is, can an (undiagnosed?) mental illness be triggered by certain people and locations? ",09Apr2017,2,

11,"So for the past several months, I've been struggling with the following: excessive sleepiness, fatigue, back acne, weight gain, and a sense of things around me being flat(2-dimensional)

This all started when I started taking certain medications over summer. First it was Xanax, which was stopped after only 2 weeks. Then soon after I began taking respirodol and fluoxetine for a few months before stopping again in the fall. 

It was when I started these medications that I began experiencing these symptoms but now it's been 8 months and they won't go away no matter how much I change up my diet, sleep, or exercise habits. What is going on??",09Apr2017,1,
12,"My question is in the form of an example, from when i was a child from between the ages of maybe 5-10.

Usually this would happen when i would think of topics in my childs mind that i would generally label as ""bad thoughts"". It doesn't particularly matter what the subject was, as from what i remember the topics would span many areas such as, violence, sexuality and drugs. 

When i would think of subjects such as this, loud usually multiple screaming muffled disorientating ""internal voices"" would take centre stage in my head after deliberating on a subject for a while.

I'd usually have to sit down on my own for a bit and get over it, i would either be quite confused or contimplate my sanity, if not both.
These events could vary in severity, however i never told anyone and no one seemed to notice as a child.

I never really experienced it again, but it would be fairly common as a child maybe 1-3 time in 4 months, however thats really hazy guess work.

I just wanted to see what people had experienced themselves or read on the topic of internalised voices and mental health? ",09Apr2017,2,

15,"I have not experienced the urge, this intensely, to cause pain or fatality on myself since I was a teen 4 years ago.  Recently, I was prescribed the anti-depressant Celexa (citalopram) by my university doctor who just wanted me out of his office ASAP.  

Having ADHD as well, (ironically the doctor insisted on anti- depressants before looking into actual medication for ADHD) it screwed with my coherency and energy 24/7.  Had to ween off so I could focus in class (I'd rather act like a squirrel than feel like a fucking zombie).

I met with a therapist afterwards and we're looking into the possibility of my symptoms being a direct result to bi-polar disorder.  I just researched celexa again and learned that it shouldn't be prescribed to people with that, or a history of suicidal thoughts. 

Leading up to tonight, I didn't know what was going on with me. I am not an aggressive person, but this has been the worst night of the past week I've been without the meds and started to engage in spasms of hair pulling, continuous screaming, pinch squeezing my old scar tissue and banging my head against the wall or with my fists.

I've been trying really hard to meditate, relax and sleep, but this is being caused by continuous intrusive thoughts related to memories/current issues with other people.  I'm an extremely intuitive person, I understand myself well enough to know why this is happening so that's why I'm reaching out.  It's late and I have nobody to communicate with, even writing this out has helped a bit.

Please share your personal experiences and coping mechanisms to help prevent me from doing anything stupid that I might regret.  Any comments welcome, I just need healthy communication about this issue.",09Apr2017,1,

18,"Just felt like making this post to vent. I don't believe there is any triggering material here.

So I'm having a really tough time here at the moment. I have a long history of mental health problems from dating when I was 4 (I'm 34 now) - trauma, depression, OCD, anxiety, panic attacks...you name it, I had it. Probably had half the DSM at one point.

This all stemmed for a variety of things, chief among them being mental, physical and sexual abuse from my parents, mainly my mother. 

It's a long story. It's so long I even wrote a book about it. Literally. I want to get it published this year.

So generally most days I cope and try to function as best as I can. But some days it's really hard. 

I made a huge push over the last 2 years and I started a company, ended a company, got into a relationship, ended it, wrote 3 books, 11 books of poetry, did my SATs and GED (have been out of school for 18 years due to mental illness) traveled to 4 countries, went for a job interview, started a blog and webpage, learnt some coding, learnt some Chinese...and there's more.

I'm probably just pushing myself too hard and need to take a break. I'm also managing visa applications to move to the USA (hate my country of birth) trying to get my book edited and published, dealing from my heartbreak, writing more...oh, and did I mention I don't have a job and I need to move out of my place by June?

Before you ask, I've been in therapy for more than a decade and am on psychotropic medication (Brintellix) I also have an extensive self-care regime of prayer, meditation, meeting friends and playing games. 

Currently down with a cold and writing this. Some days it's just really, really, really hard. I hate it when people don't understand and say bullshit like ""oh it must be so easy you don't have a job you can sit at home all day"" Does it ever occur to them that I DON'T want to sit at home all day? That I don't? 

I could go on but for brevity's sake I won't. There's just so much on my mind right now. Confused, upset, tired and sad.

19,"I have been depressed for several years. Over the past couple of months I have lost many of my social skills and the ability to be a normal person. I feel that I have died inside, and I alternate between wanting to be a person and wanting to be above humanity entirely. I have come to the conclusion that my brain is not fit for this world, and I don't know what to do anymore. I want to drop out of college and be a musician or writer, but I have severe motivation problems and am not sure if I would be able to do anything. I can barely accomplish anything without adderall, I fear that I will become completely dysfunctional if put on antipsychotics. I want to die and live at the same time, I switch opinions and goals too easily. I tried to get help from my psychiatrist and a psychotherapist, but they either do not care or cannot comprehend my thoughts. I want to be a person again, but I don't know what to do. I can't let the suicidal part of me take hold, especially now. If anyone understands what I mean, please help me decide what to do. ",09Apr2017,2,
20,"Hi. I'll try to keep this brief.  My girlfriend and I have been together roughly two years and we're currently having some issues.  She's in an internship in a town 100 miles away and is very busy with that, though we have been able to visit once a month or so. 

Recently, things have been going downhill. She got mad at me because I fell behind on rent in our current apartment and didn't tell her. I didn't tell her because in my mind she already has enough on her plate and I got the issue resolved once my taxes came in.  She was mad I didn't tell her but things seemed okay for a bit. During that first argument (about a month ago), she said that she was having second thoughts about moving back in with me and that she really enjoyed her independence in the city she is in. She also said that she is usually too busy to miss me, which I can understand in some level but still hurt. 



Things were going fine and seemed patched for a bit. This past week and a half, I've had terrible insomnia and my motivation, focus, eating habits, and class attendance have all declined (I'm supposed to graduate this semester from undergrad). I spent all the days in bed with my head in the blankets wanting to disappear. I barely ate or drank, neglected my dog...not a fun time.  I did reach out to a mutual friend of ours who also happens to be our neighbor - we went out for karaoke, strictly platonic. I contacted my friend before I contacted my girlfriend strictly for the sense of being efficient - GF busy till 10 each night and is far away, while neighbor is next door. 

Girlfriend got very mad that I went to our friend first and not her. I tried to explain what has been going on, but she angrily said that she has felt excluded from my making important decisions about my future employment (offered a fulltime job and accepted it) and other things. She also said that I was just making excuses and that my depression was just senioritis and I was bullshitting since I ""couldn't go to class, but I could go to karaoke with (friend)!"" Note: GF said she was not at all worried about my neighbor and I and was glad that I have supports in town, but was upset I didn't tell her first (which I can somewhat understand).

I tried to tell her that if it had just been senioritis I would still have been eating food and sleeping well, but she said that was bullshit again.  This got me more upset and I began crying harder; I told her about some trauma that I'd been struggling with and she said, ""I can't handle this,"" and hung up. She also stated that it is exhausting trying to deal with my fallout all the time, but when I tried to point out that I was reaching out to her for support she didn't say anything. 

We spoke a while later and I asked about coming to visit her this weekend, she said that she didn't really want to see me and she wanted space.  The next day we exchanged a couple snapchats and I texted her a little bit about some mail that came by with her name on it, but that's it.  Today I waited for her to make the first contact (giving her space) and she did not. 

I really hope that we can work things out, but I'm honestly really hurt by her recent comments and I think that if I don't hear from her by Monday or so, I'll try to call her so we can have a heart to heart about where to go from here.  I'm wondering if she's wanted a break, but trying to just go a day at a time. 

Does anyone have any advice/comments?

TL;DR: girlfriend and I had our second big fight and I think she may want to break up with me. ",09Apr2017,2,

First he told me he had cushing syndrome. He sent me messages the next day, and I asked him about his disease and he said that he doesn't have Cushing Syndrome.

After about 1 month of him sending me nonsense on random topics, I've had it. I want to know if this guy has mental problems. Everything he says is unreliable as he isn't consistent.

Here is a conversation I've had. I redacted the usernames for privacy. He is also from Israel. When he says Bobby, he's referring to my username. And this conversation took place in less than 1 hour.

26,"I'm not really sure how long it's been going on since it took me until last year to admit that I was having them. They're specifically persecutory in nature if it matters. I'm trying to figure out how to go about getting treatment when I can't afford it. My family being hetero supremacist has lead to the conclusion that they're denying me access to treatment because I'm gay, but in this bout of clarity I seem to be having right now I'm actually open to the possibility that it's a matter of them not being able to afford it either. I don't know where to begin. No one in their right mind is going to hire me and I aged out of any programs that could have helped me years before I knew they existed. 

Edit: I forgot to mention that the biggest complication is probably the fact that they seem to be triggered by negative emotions like anger, fear, sadness, and depression, which only has the effect of compounding these feelings and getting caught in a cycle of self hatred for being so weak.",09Apr2017,3,
27,"Last September I was sadly kicked out my school since I was always sick and well let's just say this school is just stuck up there arse as well and do this too a lot of students for no reason. my education is important to me and I broke down scared I wouldn't find another school or have to take another Carrier path. This really put a dint with my depression and caused me to start having panic attacks again from the stress. At the time my friends and boyfriend where there for me the whole of that month I felt so special to have such good friends. It kept me at ease and was the only thing really making me smile on a daily day basics. I felt like I finally fitted in somewhere with these group of people I cluding my boyfriend. I've never had that at all in my life we was all into gaming, art, anime etc and where all taking the same course. But as they say bad things come in 3s, that's exactly what happened. 

After getting kicked out of school and trying to find a new one with a fitting course to my needs, my long time boyfrjend cheated on me and then gave me 5 months of pure tourture this included manipulating me, making me guilty for no reason, shouting at me, using my mental health against me and telling me I caused to have depression. When in reality he was playing a game and stayed because he most likely felt guilty or wanted two girls at once. This made my mental health plunge into so much darkness I felt alone and my friends where only half arsed to be there, maybe not even that. I cried every night because of this unwanted guilt and hurt that he caused and having nonody to talk to, I had to keep it in for myself if I liked it or not. 

Because of his lies and his manipulation eventually my friend group that I finally found, that I finally felt apart of something drifted away, it was as if none of them ever existed and where some form of my imagination, even him. My best friend stopped talking to me in January along with my ex, she stopped all contact with me after having a conversation with my ex on why he was treating me like this, she called me to say I was making him feel guilty and worthless, and it seemed I was blaming him for everything and I was making him look bad. He told her that I was being toxic for breaking down in front of him and wanting help and feeling alone. He lied. He lied and yet again he made me look bad and that I was doing bad things to him, even though it was other way round. If anyone truly knows me they know that am not the type of person to cause trouble, I hate drama.
All I want is to be happy and the people around me to be happy as well .Anyone who stopped speaking to me and asked how I was all of sudden could see how much he changed me and how broken I was one old best friend said I seemed like a different person. Meaning I was more quite, my smile had gone and the parts that made me myself had disappeared. 

I did thankfully move schools in the October by the way and even though I was damage from the current crisis in my life, I tried to make friends with some classmates, it went well at first and thought I could try make at least one good friend. But since February they've stopped talking to me they don't include me in anything, no matter how much I'll try make a joke or help them out, they will push me away. And to top it all of my other best friend is now leaving me, the one I mentioned before who said I changed. He's now lying to me saying that he has no time to go out but then will go out with others all the time and say am dumb for wanting to see him. 

I don't know what I've done wrong to deserve this, am also the bubbly person in the group, I try my best to make others happy and keep a intrest in things they talk about. Even if am down and broken inside I'll always push myself to smile and laugh with others, just so they don't feel down or sorry for me and well so we can have a good time. But yet again I have no one. I just want a friend(s) that have my back, am sick of being hurt and am sick of being lonely. I don't think I can take being this alone for another minute. Just having that one friend can make a difference. I wanna go out and I wanna be happy and have a good time with others. It's the type of person I am, not closed of in my room feeling sorry for myself. And wonder what book or anime I will go to next. I just need someone. 

Am sorry this is so long but I really need the help, I guess it would help to know am 18 and go to counciling, I've told her  this stuff but she hasn't really helped. Thank you for taking your time to reading this and help , I appreciate it, have a great day! :)",09Apr2017,1,

29,"10 minutes ago, I admitted something in front of a person.
something I hadn't even admitted to myself in my own head yet.
and I did an awful job of it.
I couldn't even join a few words and utter a sentence that actually made sense. 
All I did was spit out a few rusty phrases. I said what I could in that moment, that moment that felt like a head rush, like an emotional seizure, like a rainstorm in drought. Occasionally a tear would roll into my mouth and I would taste it on my tongue and once again realise that this moment was infact, real.
Anxiety.
Thats what I decided to call it. I said it was ""my anxiety"".
I don't remember how it went. But I can give you a version of it. A version of it that isn't in a state of outburst or panic.

 ""My anxiety came back"" I said, as if I was talking about an old friend. 
When it acts up, everything becomes meaningless and hopeless. I don't want people, I don't want myself. Suddenly everything that has ever gone wrong comes back to me and I blame myself for it all. I don't feel like I should talk to you or anyone else because I don't want to burden anyone with my problems, my problems, MY PROBLEMS WITH MYSELF, my problems, that aren't even real. I overthink. I overthink. Till it gives me a headache. I cant ask for help. I cant even help myself. Because its me who is doing this to my head in the first place. And then, and then you run away.
You're not there. You, You remember?"" I said, barely talking now. Just crying. 
""When I told you? that when you're there, Everything slows down for a second, There is no overthinking. For a moment, whatever is worrying me shuts up. Whatever is telling me I don't deserve anything because I suck, shuts up.""

And like an infant, I cry. I cry, wetting the pillow cover under the side of my face, wetting her hair over my eyes as I feel her arms tighten around me forming an envelope of  Suddenly, suddenly I felt 7 folds safer. Suddenly I didn't regret saying all of this out loud anymore. Suddenly I felt like it was okay. Like maybe it was fine, saying things, about my problems, was okay. Maybe the people who care do want to listen. Listen.

And then,
somebody knocks on the door. It must be Aayushi, I think.
I wake up from my comforting numbness as the envelope disappears with a sudden jerk. 
She gets up. I ask for my blanket to cover the mess that was my hair and face. Like a ruined village after a storm. 
The door opens and someone switches on the lights. 
I hear laughter. 
I hear them talk. 
They walk in. 
Sit on the opposite bed, as she opens up a bag of food and they revel in idle banter.
As aayushi asks me ""are you okay hetvi?"" 
I say, as always, as Ive been all my life, 
""Im fine re, just tired I guess",09Apr2017,3,

When I was being myself i was just a emotionless depresses blob, so I created these Identities inside me.

Jay which was a girl version of me.
And him, i am calling him ""him"" because I don't remember what I called him.

Anyways he was just a more careless, energetic, fearless and confident version of me. Kind of like the second personality of the main character in Me, Myself and Irene.

Anyways In 8th year of school I started watching HIMYM and Barney Stinson was my favourite character, so I adapted his personality, every trait, thought. I just full on Copied him.

8th year was over and in Summer I somewhat developed my ""Own personality"" and could finally be myself.

But recently things that scare me have been happening.

""Him"" is back

And worst part is that we talk to eachother, It started when i was alone but now i even do it in public.

When I talk to him, it feels like he is talking from my mouth, like i am talking. But I don't control what he is saying, and sometimes he takes control and does things that I WOULD NEVER do in my entire life and he has no regrets while doing it.

And sometimes i even have black outs in my memory.

Doctors were shocked by these symptoms and tested me for various cancers as their first assumption. I became depressed when they couldn't find anything abnormal.

My mind is less clear, and I am more cranky (I suppose the ''cranky old man stereotype'' has some basis in fact). It takes me much longer to process simple instructions and I find myself getting confused and more forgetful which are all symptoms of dementia.

38,"sometimes I feel like my thoughts are moving kind of slow. I feel this though conversation and sports, always heard I move in ""slow motion"". it's also difficult to make an original opinion on some things and my memory scored pretty (very) low on a recent test I took. What steps or actions can I do to improve these both? ",09Apr2017,3,

42,"Im sorry,i know i worded the title terribly but i don't know how to explain it and im desperate and i have nobody to talk to...

So,im 13 and im a very optimistic and happy person.But sometimes i feel like im battling my own mind...well a negative version of it..if you get what i mean...
My mind usually reflects who i really am but sometimes i feel like it isnt me at all....it gets dark and says horrible things like for example:when i want to think positively,it always turns negative.Like i picture my bully when i want to picture nice stuff.
Or when i want to remember my grandma who passed away and pray for her (may she rest in peace) my mind pictures her with
a scary face for example.But i usually brush it off right after....other times i cry (i must admit)
So long story short,my mind often pictures the opposite of what i want...
Please help,i never talked about this before to anyone and i feel like you could help me....Thank you.",09Apr2017,3,

45,"26 year old female. married. own a house. have cats. husband cheated on me. I have anxiety, depression, mood issue, chronic fatigue, insomnia, but I'm only on meds for anxiety. I've seen seven therapists and will continue. Psychiatrists who can prescribe meds just say go to therapy, it doesn't matter that I can't function on a daily basis. I miss most of my classes at school. I got fired from my job. I might be getting a divorce. Seriously what else could happen and what am I supposed to do?  I'm so tired, I can't DO much. My life looks so put together but now I'm a complete failure. My husband and I keep trying to work it out but today he just said that he doesn't think it can be worked out. I've been with him through all the tough times in his life but he won't be there for me. I need help but how do I get it?",09Apr2017,4,

47,"Hello all, I'm 19 and from the States, and I need your help. This is a throwaway for privacy reasons, and also my first time in the sub. Formatting may be bad, as I don't post often, hope it is all legible. Recently my cousin has been experiencing some personality changes, and I'm scared for her mental and physical health. I'll start at the beginning to give as much context and information as I can.

 My cousin is my age, she's about 9 months younger than me. When we were 4, her brother died in the hospital, and basically drove her family apart. Her father started drinking much more and was diagnosed with bipolar tendencies (not sure if diagnosis was before or after his sons death). Her other brother was recently sent to a rehab center (clinic?) in Florida, for his destructive tendencies, alcoholism, prescription pill abuse, mixing alcohol and barbiturates. Her mother and father split a while back, and I suspect that my aunt was depressed (not positive). 

My cousin (call her E) has struggled since her brother's death. She is an awesome person, but she was prone to random crying, and is very emotional at times. I've always thought she was depressed, but call it being a bad cousin, we never talked about if she was diagnosed or not. What I need your help on is something different than what I've discussed, recently her whole personality has changed and it is scaring me, my brother, and her friends. 

I first noticed it when she went on spring break a couple weeks back. She was drinking a whole lot, like heavily intoxicated every night, and when she came back she seemed like a different person. She posted about how she had gotten to know herself so much on spring break and new exactly what she wanted to do with her life. All this sounds like a good thing, and I thought the same.

I work with her and noticed that she was very different; she was giggling uncontrollably and finding everything to be hilarious, and moving around a lot, like fidgeting I guess. I asked her about her break and she seemed delusional, saying that she found herself and was going into law school to change the world. 

Yesterday my brother (who goes to school with her) talked to me and told me she was being very wild, drinking until she blacked out multiple times a week and generally acting ""crazy"" when they were out in public. I texted her best friend about it, and she told me this. ""She's just been running around rampant like saying all this random stuff like she's gonna be president and she's gonna win the Nobel Peace prize and all this nonsense. She doesn't sleep much idk."" This is extremely out of character for E. E's best friend also showed me some texts of E talking about her brother's ""cold dead face.""

I learned she's been on an anxiety medication since November. E's bestie (as previously mentioned, we'll call her S) has talked to both E's mom and E's dad and says they did nothing about it. Today I called E's sister who lives out of state, and told her about what I've heard and noticed. She dismissed it as E being on the new medication, and also just ""enjoying the college experience."" Also told me that we were making it a bigger deal than it was, and that ""people are scared of change""??? This is not good change, she seems psychotic and manic, and I'm scared she will hurt herself or worse. We are not getting any support from the adults in this situation, and I don't know what to do. I need serious help about how to handle this.",09Apr2017,3,
