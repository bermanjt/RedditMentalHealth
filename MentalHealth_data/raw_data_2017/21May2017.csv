Anyways she's on her 2nd tonight and her moods been great already, placebo right now or not it's awesome compared to how she was. I understand they mess with sex drive etc. Anyways, thing got funky and we started.  She got wet, etc. It was hard for her to orgasm and cum...expected...but when she came she was upset, because she didn't like the feeling afterwards? Very strange considering she's never EVER said something like that after? Just curious f anyone has suffered the same thing? It's almost like she doesn't enjoy it as much. I understand there's so much going on in the body, I don't blame her and no sex for awhile doesn't bother me at all lol. But I'm just curious if it feels strange, weird or awkward after anyone here has orgasmed while using fluoxetine or something anti depress",21May2017,1,

10,"I'm a 21 year old male who currently lives with my girlfriend, 2 cats and my dog. I have a job in the construction industry which pays alright for my lifestyle since I'm a first year apprentice.
Lately I've been overwhelmed with constant feelings of dread and anxiousness. My body constantly has a feeling of tension which draws a likeness to a come-up on LSD or mushrooms. I also have constants bouts of paranoia and although some are not too serious or even likely I'm still worried because it's often the first resolution my mind conjures up.

Ive always been a critical thinker and more inside my head than others often are. My parents would often voice how proud they were of my emotional  intelligence as a younger person.


Some attributions that may be inducing this are my experimentations with LSD, mushrooms and cannabis. I drink nearly every weekend at the same place with the same people too.

Lately I feel myself going through the motions in life as I already own a house and don't really feel as though I have much left that I want to achieve. I currently just see having a child as a financial burden and I've noticed I became easily agitated at my animals. I'm constantly having to ask myself why I'm consciously keeping myself alive as my deep core view of the universe revolves around the redundancy of everything; nothing seems to truly have purpose anymore..

I apologise for the formatting of this post as I just continue to think of information to provide so someone can provide a clearer picture of what is happening with me.",21May2017,3,
11,"I just wanted to have other people's opinions/thoughts on what is going on in my life lately to decide if I actually think I need to see a therapist of any sorts. I also just kind of want to get this off of my chest.

I have extremely violent dreams. I used to have the teeth falling out dream, but its been a while since I had that one. But I often have dreams of brutal deaths or other things that dont seem normal for an adult (21). Usually it's me or a person close to me who dies, but occasionally its just people whose faces ive seen in class. If its not death in my dreams, it could be anything from any sort of monster, abuse, or even just dreams that have a creepy vibe. I am occasionally woken up in the middle of the night by these dream and my boyfriend when he realizes I am having nightmares. According to him, I mumble, talk, and toss and turn in my sleep when im having a bad dream. 

But not all of my dreams are like this. just last night I had a dream that we were playing dodgeball in a courtyard on my college campus. I have at least 2-3 bad dreams a week. On average, I'd say 4-5 nights a week include a bad dream. 

My boyfriend thinks this is like PTSD from when I was violently molested several times by my boyfriend at the time when I was about 14. When I told my friends, they practically disowned me. I'll admit, I do have a recurring nightmare of it happening again and again, but I don't know if I should be attributing ALL of my bad dreams to this life event.

I'm a very open person so please feel free to ask me anything. I just want to know if its normal for someone my age to be having these kinds of dreams. I don't think its normal and Im terrified to go see a therapist. ",21May2017,1,

18,"I'm 26. M. From iran. My father died 13 years ago. We had chicken factory that my brother start to manage it after my father. He is 9 years older than me. 6 years ago he lost everything. Our money. Our factory. Now we just have some papers and unlimited sit in court. He is really selfish personally. He never said sorry. We leaving with our moms. Because of our situation I don't want to leave her alone. Actually we are very different person. No one can believe we are brothers. I can relation with different kind of people. I was rise on street( there is a saying in iran )
But he is that kind of person who just want relation with rich or famous people. So i see him every day. Every morning 
Now I'm depressed. Angry. Cant control my irritation. I can't speak to my brother. I can't stay in home when he is in home. When I hear his voice I'm going crazy. It effects on my relation with my mom. I made her sad a lot of time. I saw my mother while crying in her room. Then I become sad and depressed. I just say to my self ""he did this to us"". 
I was really fun and active. All of my friends know me as a funniest and serious guy at the same time :). They worried about me. They ask but I never answered them. 
My brother, he always do the same thing that make me crazy every day. Make noise at night. Not ask too eat all food. Same repetitive mobile notification 40 in 5 minute. Make noise when we're eating together from his mouth. I ask him a lot of time. Very kindly. But nothing changed. 
Actually I know that if someone else do the same thing i never react like this. Just my brother. In this 3 month everything become worst. I try to leave home before he wake up. And come back at late night. I quit smoking cigarettes 3 week ago. Star running, swimming and bodybuilding. I don't know but there is no different at all.some time i drink alcohol at night. Alcohol makes me less angry. Now I'm in a new situation. I just overthinking about my mothers death. It make me crazy. I just think why she is so unlucky and unhappy after my fathers died. I should mention that I can't leave home. Because I don't have enough money. But main reason is my mom. 
What can i do? I think it getting worse

20,"I'm trying very hard to earn a math and physics associates so I can transfer in 2-3 years.
So yeah I decided about this since high school. 
But my parents think I should dumb my career choices like way down. I've heard it from everyone else, but hearing it from my parents hurt the most. She said I should go to shitty vocational school. Like why should I if I know I'm smarter than that?
And I don't mean I'm smarter than anybody else I just mean I put effort into school  
 
Second they complain that I make them sick because of my behavior. The only wrong thing I do is that I smoke and occasional pills but they don't know that , but I'm pushing 20 and girls 6 years younger than me do worse. I'm saving myself for marriage(or at least until a very serious relationship) and all I do is go to school. No club no this or that. I don't have any friends. A lot of my parents friends say they wish their kids were like me. Because all they do is not go to school, work and spend their money on booze and sleep with a different guy every month. 
I lost someone very close to me, and not even two months ago. Every time I bring this person up or start crying they start complaining about their blood pressure and how they are going to drop dead someday because of my ""acts"".
I'm not acting. I'm really fucking depressed . I used to love going to school just for the fuck of learning but now I go so I can rub it in their faces and move out. I don't hate them I love them I want them to treat me differently.
And I'm really fucking depressed. Like really. I take pills that should make me feel euphoric and I still feel like dying. 
And I'm 19, but I am not allowed to go out unless I'm with my parents or someone they trust. I am barely figuring out how to socialize because I'm only allowed to hang out with who they approve of. I'm not allowed to borrow their car to fucking go buy ice cream. That's how much they don't trust me. Even if I had my own car they'd probably tell me to back home by 3pm if I went out. 
I'm a grown fucking adult and I'm smarter than most people my age. 
I'm of legal I can go out and spend time by myself and I can be in a relationship and I can do whatever I want.
I don't do dangerous and I never planed to but the more they tell me not to do it the more I want to.
Like when I started going to college I was so happy. I would take classes from 10am to 10 at night. But still every fucking time they'd lecture ""school is very important if you don't go you have to get a job we won't keep you for free"" now I hate school. Absolutely I can't sit for 3 hours of lecture. I used to sit for 10 hours if lecture with a fucking smile on my face. 

Then they all call me fat every four hours as if they think if they don't that I'll forget I'm fat. 
My mom most of all. I hear her talking with her friends and she says shit like marriage and family are a lie. When she's mad enough she says that she could have had a career if I wasn't born. 
I don't know what to do. My mental health is deteriorating very slowly. I'm so stressed out I have started to experience what I think is a very bad psychological disorder. I feel like I'm locked in a prison.  I don't deserve to be happy but I deserve to be in peace 

Edit. Also their love for me is conditional and they have said this before.
1) if I do illegal things I'm not allowed to speak to them ( don't want to do that anyway
2) they have to approve of anyone I want to date (yes I'm almost 20, never had a boyfriend, don't even know how to socialize with guys, meanwhile I know 12 year olds that have had a couple of boyfriends already)
3) I can't date anyone out of my race. My mom said this is not racist after I said it's racist (she justified by saying ""i want my bloodline to be clean"")
4) she won't love me if I don't get a college degree.  Which again is why I can't stand school anymore. I used to sit in lecture all day and excited now I'm in physical pain when I'm at school for a couple of hours. 
I can list more but idk

21,"I think I’m manic, but I don’t know for sure.

I was diagnosed with Bipolar II Rapid-Cycle two years ago after being observed by several psychiatrists for 14 years, however I never identified with the disorder and have always considered it a misdiagnosis.

More recently, with the diagnosis in mind, I’ve been more cognizant/sensitive to my attitudes and behaviours that may align with its symptoms.

I’m not sure if I’m becoming aware of a reality, or if the diagnosis is having a placebo effect.

25,"Hi Reddit. I just started a new full time job after dropping out of uni. Prior to this I hadn't worked since November last year. I've been at this job for two weeks. Because of public transport, I'm out of the house for 12 hours, and I can't even read on the bus because I get motion sick. The two weekends I've had have been packed with errands and obligations. 

I am on anti depressants and I also have anxiety.

In the two weeks at this job I feel I've done really well, worked super hard and fit in with my coworkers. 

How bad would it be if I took tomorrow off work to spend at home by myself, maybe do some yoga and read? It's obviously not ideal since I've just started but I feel like I might suck this week anyway because I'm stressed and don't want to be there.",21May2017,2,
26,"I'm only young. I haven't even graduated highschool yet. And yet everytime I think about my future I'm overcome with a soul crushing wave of hopelessness. I feel like I've failed already. I'm in the 'smart' class, but I certainly don't feel that way. I feel so inadequate when I look around at all of the brilliant minds in my class. I always feel sick when driving past or to school. Nobody ever knows that something's wrong though, because I'm the funny kid. The one to put a smile on people's faces. I'm also a shoulder to lean on. I can't go a day without picking, prodding or popping blemishes  on my skin. I can't go an hour without chewing the sides of my mouth or tongue. I took an anxiety test and got 61. The healthy level is below 40. I want to fucking cry. I'm crying as I write this. The mere prospect of having some form of anxiety scares me. Frustrates me. I start crying at the thought of anxiety. I've had a lot go on recently. My grandmother's condition is rapidly declining (she has Alzheimer's). She might live for another 5 years. Homework keeps piling up. I barely get through each week. I don't get enough sleep. Sometimes it's so bad that my speech is kinda slurred. We have to sing a song and play instruments as part of our music assessment. I started fucking crying in class when the teacher said that. I hate performing. I'm terrible at music. I hate singing in front of people but am fine talking to people. I don't understand why. I feel like my IQ has dropped purely due to lack of sleep and a heightened level of stress. I'm always fidgeting. Tapping my feet. Shaking my leg. It makes me feel stupid. Nobody else has the urge to do this, why do I? I'm always procrastinating. I hate myself for it. I've come a long way in terms of self acceptance but there's still a lot that I hate about myself. I hate the look of my skin. I hate my hairy stomach. I hate how I get snappy. I hate how I say things that I regret. I dont even know what to do anymore. I feel inadequate. I don't want to feel this way. And yet I do. ",21May2017,9,
27,"So, I grew up in an affluent family, but since I was young I was diagnosed with ADHD, and now on top of that Bipolar type II so I wasn't too normal I guess. Apparently ADHD is related to antisocial personality disorder. Currently my psychiatrist thinks I could have borderline personality disorder, but I never think in black-and-white and I don't have a strong fear of abandonment. Regarding my future, I'd like to work high-up in a business one day.

I think it could be ASPD or NPD, perhaps.
I struggled with some fun drug use during my later high school years all the way up to a couple months ago when I got kicked out of my university's residence hall from an Adderall OD.

Anyway, during high school I once came after my father with a knife but stopped, and I've purposely laid hands on both my mother and father. I laughed when I saw the tears roll down my mom's cheeks when I sorta choked her. I have some odd disdain for both of them, they act like our family's all fine and dandy but they're too afraid to acknowledge it. We/they were going to family counseling/marriage counseling but that fell through, of course.

I take Klonopin and sometimes Xanax to just feel normal (non-agressive and calm), and along with that I take Wellbutrin and Lamictal.

I've always been told I act spontaneously and I love to spend a lot, and if I can't spend a lot I need some other way to get my ""fix,"" whether it be talking to somebody for a while, doing a hobby, etc.
When I'm bored, I feel at my worst. I HAVE to be doing something, no matter what it is.

When I was in high school, I was a slacker but, a ""smart"" one. Plus, I was probably dealing with my own problems so school was sort of another burden on me. I remember getting 20 bucks out of this kid by convincing him I was poor just for my own amusement.

Regarding trouble with authorities, I usually get into trouble with lesser authorities but I have had the police come to my house if I became agressive. After those days happen I just feel normal.

Also, I feel as if I'm an adrenaline junkie regarding anything. I like to develop a stress tolerance.

I'm confused, but I believe I'm seeing my psychiatrist soon for an assessment/to catch up.
On the other hand, I need help figuring out myself regarding cluster B personality disorders since this is getting out of hand and I don't seem to really ""care"" outwardly.

I notice I feel normal and friendly and all that, likeable and stuff when I'm with friends or out of the house, or enjoying stuff with people I enjoy.

28,"Female, 22. 

When I was younger my mum had postnatal depression. I could always see a difference between the treatment of my brother and I, I could see she wanted him around and didn't want me there. We have spoken about it as I have got older, and my mum has told me she did not like me when I was younger and couldn't bond with me at all. Which I understand was caused by the depression but it didn't help 6-year-old me. As a child I couldn't understand it, and fought for attention and affection - I never received it.

Mum and I are in a better place now, there are still instances where I get the grief, but we do not argue that much anymore. Just for perspective on the arguing, I was admitted to hospital when I was around 3 because I refused to eat and I was loosing hair - all caused by stress apparently.

I'm now in a relationship of 2 years, and I am engaged to the most wonderful person I could ever wish to meet. The only problem is, I am insecure and paranoid as hell. My previous relationship was a disaster and I was cheated on a few times. Since that, I think I find it hard to 'break down the walls' because past experiences has taught me this just causes pain. My current partner has never done anything to hurt me, make me suspicious and has supported me but when it comes to him going on nights out with his mates etc. I can't help but get paranoid. Like heart palpitations paranoid.

I think the rejection from childhood, and previous negative experiences has caused these insecurities. I'm just scared I'm going to get hurt. **once again though, my current guy hasn't done anything to hurt me or cause me doubt. 

How can I get over this? My partner feels he needs to ask my permission before he goes out to make sure I don't get upset, it shouldn't be like that, and I usually insist he goes out even if I don't want him to.

29,"basically last week i ended up going on a bit of a bender, on wednesday night i lost my keys and couldn't go home because my housemates had exams the next day so i decided to go to the house of an old acquaintance (in my drunken state it was the only place i could think to go) he didn't let me in so i had to sleep in the park until it was reasonable to wake up my housemates (7 am). The next day i had a big university presentation in the evening and the acquaintance who had not let me stay on his sofa came to watch, it was very odd and he didn't talk to me but i felt like he was mocking me. After the presentation we all went on a night out to celebrate, i ended up telling my housemates about my rape before we went to the club and they were shocked but supportive. In the club i was shocked by how predatory the mens behaviour was, its something you get used to but being raped has opened my eyes to how horrible it actually is. I got upset and a a stranger (girl) in the smokers area gave me half a pill of something (i know its stupid to take it, but at this point i was suicidal and just wanted to forget everything). I have very little memory of what happened but know that i ended  up in my room with a housemate and a friend who took all my razors and spoke to me till 5am when i eventually passed out. I woke up with a text from the police and a voicemail saying there was a concern for my welfare but i haven't done anything about this (when i reported my rape the police blamed me and it was horrible and i want nothing to do with them). I felt terrible the next day and spent all day in bed and havent seen any of my housemates since. Ive been having terrible nightmares and i wake up in cold sweats, they're so vivid. Last night I went and saw a friend and we ended up having sex and afterwards i felt horrible and used (even though he was really nice and did nothing wrong). I came home at about 2am and texted another friend who I'm hoping is going to come and see me but he probably won't. I know i probably shouldn't be drinking or going out but i do enjoy it when i don't think about the rape, my problem is that i wander off so often end up on my own. what can i do i feel so stupid? i slept in the park which was fucking stupid, i took an unknown substance. i basically don't care whether i live or die and i just want to blank out everything that happened. i don't want anything to do with the police. i am on the waiting list for counselling and have a student support officer i can go and see but i just feel so alone. does anyone know what is happening to me? is this a breakdown??",21May2017,1,

33,"I love my wife. We have been together for nearly 3 years and married for a year now. Recently she confided to me that sometimes she gets extremely violent thoughts and sometimes feels she wants to act on them, although she assured me she would never really act on them.

When she told me, she presented it as a problem that she needed help with. The violent thoughts are to do with people who have hurt her emotionally in her past. Her ex. Her teacher in elementary school. 

When I say violent, I mean it. Not punching or kicking, but murder. Stabbing, hanging, gutting or worse. She briefly mentioned to me a few weeks prior that she wants to 'skin' her ex. I shrugged it of as just an extreme example of her hatred for him. But now I realize it is much worse.

When she admitted it all to me the other day my initial reaction was to help her. And that's what I've been trying to do over the last few days. Reminding her that thoughts are just thoughts. Much of the time we have no real control over them, but we can't let them define who we are as a person.

My problem now is that she is resisting any of my help. Getting defensive. Even trying to normalize her thoughts/urges. 

She says now that these thoughts make her happy. She is saying stuff like ""in the past these violent acts were more acceptable so why should we judge them nowadays?"" 

She admitted yesterday that she's 'found a website' with people just like her on it who have the same thoughts. After I relentlessly questioned her about it, it seems that on this website you can also access images of such violence. 

I was appalled and confused about why she is now justifying and integrating these thoughts into her life.

I tried to help. I can only do so much. She just gets defensive. I am worried that she might even watch videos of violence or murder to satiate these thoughts.

She is normally the sweetest and loveliest person. But these revelations have really tainted my view of who she is. Not because she has messed up thoughts. Everybody has messed up thoughts from time to time. But because she is now not admitting that this is something she needs to work on. Instead she is normalizing them and internally encouraging them. 

What do I do? Should I leave? Should I continue to offer my support? I need help!

I feel like our whole relationship is tainted because of darkness she is unwilling to address maturely. 

Please help me! I love her but I don't want to end up living with a psychopath in a few years from now!


Edit: Also - She slipped up when she was admitting these kind of thoughts to me the other day. There was a moment where she meant to say ""when I have these kind of thoughts it makes me happy"" but what she blurted out instead was ""when I watch those videos..."" then she corrected herself and said ""thoughts"" instead. I love her more than anything in the world, and she loves me in the same way. I don't understand how I can help her if she is so unwilling to be helped. What should I do?!

Its been 10 days since the last infusion and the problem persists.

I was not told at all by the medical staff that the dissociation can persist. I am very angry about that. Id have cancelled the treatment if I knew. They just said that goes away after the infusion is stopped so I trusted that and went with it. 

While the experience itself was good, it did nothing to help my issues. Now I have unrelenting anxiety about the feeling of disconnection.

My psychiatrist said it should go away. But holy shit its taking forever. Its improved since 9-10 days ago but I still dont feel as connected to my friends and that thought constantly bothers me.

Ive been trying to go to the gym, actively change my thought patterns and say that this wont last forever, distract myself, etc but nothing is working!!! Im using CBT to help but its not getting rid of the feeling its only helping to cope!

This is fucking ridiculous bc I try to help myself with a treatment and get a completely bad reaction. Im worried what if I need to do tons of mindfulness to deal with this which was physiologically induced. I fucking hate itZ

37,"Any good ways to make me okay with force obeying time structures that help me emotionally balance but also fine with having flex time and not seeing my structured time as important when interrupted or postponed?

If I think something matters, I will fight tooth and nail for it and my best. I become devastated when things that matter don't go my way because I'm highly invested in everything compulsively. My memory starts lapsing and I can't think and have meltdowns when I become stressed.

I used to eat when hungry and sleep when tired, then my therapist handed me social rhythm sheet and I worked out a system and now I get exasperated if I can't follow it, because I'm investing in this for my life and emotional stability.

Sometimes the people helping take care of me don't relay logistics and I get postponed without a clear idea, or there is some environmental factor preventing me from hitting the mark. It causes a ton of anxiety I didn't have before, because of dread of getting even worse (even though I'm already homeless).

The way I usually handle things that bother me is by devaluing it in my mind saying its not as important as I think. But that makes me feel like I don't love myself (because the only reason I stick to the timetables is to help me stay emotionally stable) and then I become incredibly depressed.

I'm always so busy helping myself, I have trouble seeing a future beyond a couple days. That too is sad.

I am failing at life and its all my fault",21May2017,34,
39,"What is your motivation/reason for interrupting abnormal motivations/thoughts/desires? Specifically involving things like fabricating stories to deceive people, reckless spending, stealing, violent outbursts and any other negative aspects of a personality d/o. And if you are willing to share, how do you personally try to sort out/correct your thought processes? 

In my case I am tired of living my life going from failure to failure. Wondering when I will be caught or when my past misdeeds will come back to bite me. I am tired of faking it all. Even if there isn't a way to connect with those around me I don't want these stories and charades I do on a day to day basis to be my life because it is tiring. Having to second-guess every thought I have, every action I take, is exhausting but not nearly as taxing or dangerous as the life/lie I live.

So far I have not found anything to help. I continue the destructive behaviors I've had since I was a kid and my shitty interpersonal relationships continue to be shitty. I have a s/o right now and I want to be a good partner, to fit the role and blend in, but I don't think I have the capacity. I keep falling to negative habits. Any advice?

41,"Hi everyone. Quick backstory, I have BP,  BPD and Sexual Abuse history, and have been dealing with it since I was 14. Over the years Ive had 10 jobs, all of which attendance was an issue due to severe anxiety/rage/or had completely detached from reality. At my ER job my manager told me in one year I had 168 call offs. I have 10 hospitalizations behind my belt, have taken almost every type of antipsychotic, done several types of therapy (starting DBT again) and I just recently dropped my school program until I get stable.

I think it's time to talk to my doctor about disability. I had a previous psychiatrist that I no longer see because she refused to sign FMLA papers for my last job I was fired from. I'm scared my new psychiatrist will have the same attitude. 

How do I start the conversation? What is the process like? I look high functioning but I am not and I'm worried that because I look nice they won't take me seriously. 

Thank you very much for reading. ",21May2017,1,
42,"I've spent the past couple of hours taking multiple personality tests. The results have come out that I have a ""likelihood"" of having borderline personality disorder or histrionic personality disorder, based on my own (painfully honest) answers. 

I certainly have a history of unstable relationships and behaviors, but I am currently in a stable, conflict-free relationship and I truly feel like I've kept the bulk of my unstable behaviors at bay for a while now. I have spent a lot of my twenties in depressive episodes, and my coping mechanisms have often been to spend money recklessly in order to fill the ""hole"" that's there. However, recently, I've made a lot of changes personally, and no longer feel the urge to spend money like I used to. I also haven't felt genuinely depressed in a long time, and I chalk this up to me pulling myself up and cutting out unhealthy things that have kept me down. I've also had trouble readjusting after breakups; when I dated someone abusive, I harmed myself after the breakup, and it took me a while to recover, but I do feel like I've made a lot of progress. I have distanced myself from people like him and feel like I can instinctively know when I meet someone who reminds me of him, and immediately put up a wall.

My new partner and I have not had a single fight, and we've been together for six months. I have healthy friendships, avoid impulsive and risky behaviors, and participate in activities that make me feel genuinely good and whole, like a book club I founded and an activist collective I co-founded. I don't feel empty and I certainly don't feel like I have no sense of self, which are some of the main symptoms of borderline personality disorder.

While I agree to an extent that my behaviors of the past have perhaps pointed toward a personality disorder--BPD, specifically--I also feel, and have almost always felt, like a completely different person around my friends and coworkers than I do around my family. My family and I have a long, complicated history and I feel that there is so much unresolved pain and anguish from when I was a kid. My dad, for example, triggers a lot of anger in me, says mean things, and pushes me to a point where I emotionally explode. This happened over Mother's Day weekend. My brother and I also had a conflict because I called him out for avoiding me these past few months, and then he responded by saying he thinks I have a personality disorder. 

Because my family (except for my mom) distances themselves from me, they don't see me the way I am today, since they don't spend time with me to see the reality of who I am. However, my mom also thinks I have a personality disorder, but she can't even say which.

It is immensely hurtful to feel like people within my family are willing to say I have a personality disorder, because I do feel like these people know me the best and know my history, so of course, it's not right to just throw away what they say. Still, I can manage my adult life much better than I used to, and yet they all still are pointing at me as the problem and me as the one with the ""personality disorder."" I don't feel like they've done much looking inwardly at themselves (with again the exception of my mom) as to how their behaviors may be problematic as well.

I will take any advice, words of kindness, ideas, suggestions for how to move forward.

**tl;dr** My family members think I have a personality disorder. I feel strong and secure in my current life and do not think any of my inward emotions or outward behaviors point to a personality disorder, but recent conflicts with them over Mother's Day weekend have caused them to state that they think I have one. This ""diagnosis"" makes me feel insecure and like I may actually have one. I can't tell if it's valid, or if they are just the ones who trigger me to get angry and become emotionally unstable. I'm wondering what to do.",21May2017,4,

44,"On wednesday I left the lesson to go get some tissues because I was crying because I was having a mental breakdown like I often do.

As I later found out a boy in my class told our replacement teacher that I ""often leave lessons to go throw up"". What a load of bull. Anyway I spent the next half an hour being interrogated, not in a kind, counsellor way but an aggressive ""you are a terrorist tell me everything"" kind of way by this teacher who kept saying that ""things will only get worse unless I talk"". I told her that I had been seen by CAMHS and Talking Therapies who weren't interested and I had an upcoming appointment but I didn't say what for because I don't need to tell her and I don't want to. At one point, because she kept pushing me to try and find out what my trigger was she said ""I know I'm pushing you to the point of crying but this needs to happen"". Also apparently ""it's difficult"" for her, she said, ""because you never talk and when you do I get very little out of you"". I wonder why?! Maybe because you terrify me, woman!

Anyway the boy in my class who said I ""often leave lessons to go throw up"" used to threaten to kill me and would strangle me 5 years ago so that's kind of why I was upset but I wasn't going to say that because he terrifies me and I don't want to start shit that doesn't need stirring.

I just need to get that off my chest because I am currently having a mental breakdown and I really need to revise for tomorrows exam.",21May2017,6,
45,"So I have always struggled with depression since around 11 years old, I haven't ever seen a psychiatrist just multiple GP's (doctors) who have always put me on different meds etc, recently I started mirtazipine and all went well until a few days in, My anxiety was through the roof and I felt like I was experiencing a manic epidsode, then inside my head all I could hear was an unusual voice talking incoherently. This freaked me out so much I've completely stopped my med and I'm waiting for a follow up appointment from my GP. 
I think I've always heard 'voices', but it's always random things like ""caution"" or complete nonsense that I can't make sense of. I want to speak to my doctor but I'm worried they won't take me seriously and that it's just a symptom of an anxiety attack? Although sometimes the 'voices' are completely random when I'm doing day today things. ",21May2017,2,
46,"I have the worst habit of smelling everything I come in contact with. It can be bad smells or good smells, but I have to smell it! 

The reason I think this belongs in mental health, is that now, it's become an uncontrollable urge. If I don't smell something, it feels like a sneeze. This slowly growing urge that becomes unbearable. I gets worse and worse, making me more uncomfortable until my body actually moves itself and makes me smell it. It's so weird. In my mind, I'm telling myself not to, but it's so unbearable that my body doesn't listen to me. I also get random feelings of paranoia and panic if I don't smell it, like I'm missing something that could be crucial to survival. 

I have a strong connection between smell and memories. I was in the store recently and I was smelling air freshener, and I connected one to the smell of my childhood home, that was more than 10 years ago. 

Strangely enough, I have an addiction to plain food. The only spice that I really like is salt. Anything else makes me grossed out or it's unappetizing.

At first the stuff he said I just shrugged of as religious nutjobbery, you know believing in giants, reptilians, young earth, incoming apocalypse and whatnot...but he says deeply troubling things like ""when the shit hits the fan"" he's just gonna get one of his guns and shoot the whole family for their own good, he tells his wife she's gonna have to watch her whole family die because she refused to move to Kansas (he believes the whole west coast is gonna sink and Seattle is gonna get nuked)...and what's more he's legally not even supposed to have guns and he has dozens, he pressures his wife into getting them for him. His whole family is afraid of him as they should be, in fact his wife has left with the kids and ran away many states over leaving Him behind, but he tracked them down and reinserted himself into the family...twice...there is no doubt in my mind that this man is a dangerous psychopath, he's very abusive and shows no remorse and if ever he makes a mistake it is always someone elses fault. My girlfriend and her sister had no clue that being told they were worthless garbage on a daily basis wasn't normal until their teen years. He's also so narcissistic he can't possibly be sane. He sets the wallpaper on all his computers to his own face, he films himself talking about random BS and then he watches it...and of course he's too paranoid to accept help, he's been given prescriptions before that he's refused to take, and his own mother tried to have him put in a loony bin...and I could go on for hours, what do I do? how do I prove he's not mean person whos a little off and that he actually needs help?",21May2017,2,
48,"I am new to the job field, I graduated in 2016 and got a training position then after three months I signed a contract as a business analyst. My job is hectic and its fine and I realize that this is true for so many jobs but in my case it is sort of different.
The following reasons are what upsets me about my job:
* I am the only girl in the department.
* I work with older men who have been working together in IT industry for 13 years or more.
So you can imagine what its like to not fit in and have no one to relate to.
* Recently I started to have a role in a new project which I didn't like, the role I was doing is Data entry and it wasn't in my job description at all! But the project manager kept pushing me to do it because this client is ""Important"" and the project is ""Critical"" to the success of the company and it's all because the project is late in delivery and the customer feels that their entitled that we enter their data in the database because they don't have the screens to do it. I would sometimes go to home at 5 PM and still work at home till 12 or 3 AM. This went on for some time, like two weeks I would enter their data, then two weeks I would go back and focus solely on my job, then another two weeks to enter their new data. Now the worst is over and I did the job perfectly (I wasn't even planning to ruin the customer relationship because I feel like this job is below me or anything) but literally the role I did didn't add anything to me, it was pointless, useless but for the client's ego it had to be done.

After this I felt and still feel crushed, I feel like I am worthless, like anything I do doesn't have meaning, like life doesn't have meaning at all. 
I lost my appetite, I sleep late 1 am and barely wake up at 9 AM to go to work. I feel so restless while sleeping, the smallest noise wakes me up. I feel so emotionally and physically drained. and I still feel stressed from anything related to this project, I am agitated and restless and there is no one to hear me out at the company.

I dont know what to do. Please help me.

52,"Over the years, (over a decade, I am 23 and have been experiencing anxiety attacks and anger/sobbing outbursts since I was 11) I have had generalized anxiety from time to time mixed with extreme euphoric ideas that I am going to be something great. I get impulsive, spend money, can't stay at home or in one place, and frequently turn to alcohol and cigarettes. Now that I'm typing this all out even vaguely it sounds worse than I had originally felt it was. 
I have been suicidal in the past but associated it with the fact that my mother died when I was 13. This led to a brief addiction to inhalants, which I eventually stopped and replaced with moderate cigarette smoking. I'm now nicotine vaping. 
I'm hardly ever sluggish, moreso on edge, unable to sleep, and constantly antsy. But about 4 times a year I have a massive outburst full of punching, sobbing, screaming, and falling on the floor. I have wonderful friends who get me through these. I have also done things like impulsively cut off all my hair. 

I think I need to see a psychiatrist and that it is 10 years overdue. I'm going to look into it. But can anyone relate to this or think of something that could give me some answers? I always associated it with just being someone with a lot of passion, emotion, and some large tragedies in life. But lately I feel like it's only gotten worse. 
I also tend to sort of latch onto characters I relate to and sometimes sort of escape into a mental state where I try to associate more with them than myself. It has helped me remain strong. 
I am an actor who graduated college magna cum laude. It was a struggle to concentrate on work but I tended to have great relationships with professors and be very socially successful and empathetic, which got me through a lot and helped me do well.

Can anyone assess any of this?
I really appreciate it.

53,"I'm a teenager who has always felt socially and emotionally isolated from those around me, especially peers at school. My proclivity to remain silent about my most inner thoughts and express only a fraction of my true nature has led to several perceptions about me. Some people think I'm weird and naive, while others praise me for being an ideal student. My behavior does indeed vary, depending on my surroundings, but I remain overtly timid and socially-awkward, not displaying eye contact or walking stiffly, much to my dismay. This issue has led to the brewing of an almost unrelenting, underlying desire for intimacy with another human, whether physical or emotional. Whilst in solitude, I can't fight the urge to fabricate my own social scenarios, pretending that I'm talking to someone seamlessly or bantering with myself over some trivial matter, like close friends, I suppose. I also have these thoughts that I simply can not share with others; most of them are erotic and violent, the only known way of acquiring affection for me.

 Another hindrance is my tendency to obsess over obscure subjects that would bore most ""normal"" people to death; I often infuse this with my fantasy life to boost my self-confidence. I could spend hours upon hours every single day researching these narrow topics as they're my only relief from such a dull teenage life devoid of any friendships or emotional closeness. My family is extremely nurturing and I cherish the love between us deeply. Still, that doesn't seem to ward off this constant urge to be apathetic toward others yet still be intimate with them. It's such a cognitive dissonance.  ",21May2017,1,

You do not have to be depressed and generally fucked up.  I have been there, and a *radically* improved diet saved my life.  This is a list of the things that I have had success with, and I am by no means alone in having this kind of success with this list.            
           
4 grams of fish or cod liver oil *every* day.            
4,000 IUs of vitamin D3 *every* day.                
Cut out 100% of all refined foods, **particularly** refined carbs.          
Ketogenic dieting.                
Intermittent and/or extended fasting.            
Get hardcore about improving your diet along radical, paleo lines.           
Probiotics like pills to start with, then homemade kefir.
  
EFT or Emotional Freedom Technique         

Light pranayama          
Exercise

All I see is people including myself fucking their lives up with shitting diets, and then saving their own lives with radically better diets, diets not approved of by the medical authorities who forgot to mention that improving one's diet can **GREATLY** improve one's mental health, without the aid of pharmaceuticals.

Life can be a wonderful journey.  It doesn't have to be shit.  And it is particularly wonderful when you are on a journey of self-discovery and each day is better than the previous day.
