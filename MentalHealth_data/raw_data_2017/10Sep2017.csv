0,"I've spent the past four hours and 43 minutes staring at my ceiling endlessly trying to figure out what I'm supposed to do with myself. I've read a lot of stuff about procrastination in the past and I find it is usually more targetted at a different kind of person. Someone who has to get stuff done. Someone with a passion or job maybe that requires motivation and persistence from them in some way. I see all the same usually bits of advice: Timebox yourself, start with something incredibly small, reward yourself for what you _do_ get done, don't try to handle everything on your own, etc, etc. All the same which every single blog about productivity has regurgitated in different words and marketed as something ""new"" and ""useful"".

None of that is really my problem, though. For me, I just don't have anything to do. I don't have projects I work on or hobbies that interest me. Hell, I barely do anything at work simply because I don't find it important enough to me and I can get away with doing basically nothing all day. For a few years now, I spend my free time home alone just wondering what I should do. I don't even mean in grander ""big picture"" sort of way. I mean even down to small things. All I ever feel is incredibly bored and frustrated.

I'm seeing a psychotherapist about this and honestly, I'm not really sure why. It doesn't really matter what we end up talking about; the solution is always just ""You need to try harder"". I keep going back and spending money on these sessions to essentially be told the same thing in different words on a different day. I think, at this point, I only go because it's a change of pace from the usually nothing that I'm doing.

While I have no desire to do anything, I do find that I get frustrated and angry about this. I'm so mind-numbingly bored and it's getting to the point where it's interfering with my life. I'm getting all sorts of reckless urges: quitting my job because I don't feel like going anymore, hurting myself because it'd be better than just sitting around doing nothing -- something, anything really. I use to think I was depressed, but I'm really not all that sure if that's the case anymore.

In any case, I've been so stuck in my head and this ceaseless boredom is becoming more and more of a debilitating burden on my everyday life. Try as I might, I don't feel like I've had either the time or the right words to explain any of this to my therapist. I really don't think she quite understands what I've been trying to tell her. Probably because I struggle to put the actual feeling in words that I feel adequately describes it. So I decided to put this brain dump here and see if anyone has some thoughts or suggestions? Hell, I'll even just take a joke or something.

1,"My brother is 35 years old and absolutely the worst individual I know. It started around ten years ago when he dropped out of university and started developing all sorts of mental health issues. I'll say right off the bat I know he is severely mentally ill, but the thing is, his illness specifically revolves around just hurting my parents as much as possible. In front of other people he can act totally normal, he can hold a job or drive a car. Instead though, he chooses to live at home and just be a total piece of shit to my parents. He spends his days telling them how they're going to die soon, how their friends are dying around them, how he's failed his life and its their fault. He hasn't struck them or been physically violent that I've seen, but I consider what he does to be abuse. 

He refuses to seek treatment, doesn't believe that anything at all is wrong with him. My parents refuse to kick him out because they fear that he will be 'out on the streets', although before he was living at home he had a $400 mouldy apartment in halifax (he went all the way there to be 'as far as possible' but unfortunately came back). 

I'm stressed out of my gourd here. I usually have an apartment of my own or a place to stay but I've been homebound the last few months and living with the three of them. My parents are incredibly strong, kind beautiful people who deal with it the best they can but watching the daily interactions is absolutely destroying me. I am moving out soon and will be feeling better but is there ***anything*** I can do in this situation to get rid of him? ",10Sep2017,3

I was on Lexapro for 1.5 years and went off it earlier in the year. My doctor was super vague about weening, basically leaving it up to me with several options (like just go straight off, one every second day for a couple of weeks or half every day for a couple of week) I did one every second day for 2 weeks (when I say one 10 mgs) then stopped. 

It has been 4 to 5 months and I am having some severe depression. Worse than before I started (which was mostly for anxiety) I dont know whether to keep going and hope it fades or if it is just that I don't function well and I have depression.

I suffer from trauma, really bad. Alcoholic home, brain surgeries, mental health that flows through the blood etc. But I was lucky enough to pull myself out of the heavy wave of a fucked up life it was sending me towards. I'm still very emotional and anxious, and put every ounce of effort into not falling into depression - but I'm definitely not where I used to be.

Three weeks ago, my boyfriend broke up with me. Basically saying I'm too emotionally unstable for someone who's quite mellow..understandable. I'd rather you tell me now than later! The problem I feel is that he couldn't empathize on what I've been through which my emotional state being the aftermath of. 

Now he was raised with a strong home with a base of respect, and learning, and laughing, and freedom and credit where it's due..he was raised right! 

My question is, when someone hasn't been through something so personally and direct like I have - is it really hard to empathize for someone that has? 

The problem we had was he couldn't understand me, and I couldn't understand, why HE couldn't understand! If that makes sense. ",10Sep2017,2

14,"Hello fellow Redditors! I'm having a relationship problem and could really use some help and advice ASAP! My boyfriend is shutting me out. Sorry for the length.

So my name is Danny and I am in a long distance relationship with a boy who's name is Nathaniel. He lives in Southern California and I live in Kansas. Nathaniel is 19 years old and I am 20 years old. Here is our background story...I met Nathaniel in September 2016 on an app, we got to know each other, and here we are in our 3rd month so far. He is an amazing, genuine guy, and he treats me extraordinarily well, but he has poor mental health + unfortunate background and has had a lot on his plate ever since he was a child. He has ADHD, bipolar depression, and anxiety that I know of. According to him, he's everything he didn't want to be. I am not aware of the severity of the disorders he possesses, but I believe they are mild cases. He is pretty much the black sheep of his family + I feel like his family is putting a toll on his mental health and only stressing him out even more because they don't treat him well. Even his household suffers with poor mental health, too. His mother, father, and I'm sure his two much younger siblings will be bound to end up with something. In  May, he has told me that it's never been this bad for him since he was 12 years old. Just to let you all know, him having poor mental health isn't a problem to me at all. So let me just get to the problem! 

In late July, he had shut me out for a few days. I had no knowledge on what exactly was going on in his household prior to him shutting me out because everything seemed normal to me, but then he suddenly stopped replying back to me and shut me out. He shut me out because he was having major family problems and there were unpleasant events upcoming, and because he hasn't been taking his medication for months and he was feeling the physical and mental effects. Basically a withdrawal. I have no idea what medications he takes. And the reason he didn't come to me? Because he didn't want to seem like a burden to me and stress me out with his issues, and because he didn't want me to see his negative side because he finds it embarrassing. He knew he should have communicated, but he did what he usually does whenever he is under major stress. I basically reassured Nathaniel and told him he's not ever going to be a burden to me and I'm always going to be there for him with love and support. We moved on from the problem quickly. Now onto August...

So in August, things were pretty normal. We talked like we always do, but for a brief amount of days. He was gone between August 1st and 8th because he was visiting his aunt's which he told me prior to him leaving. We had zero communication because he has had no phone service for months and his aunt doesn't have wifi at her apartment complex anymore. 
We talked until the 13th. On the 11th, early in the morning while using his sister's hotspot, he told me wifi went out. Before his wifi went out that same morning, it was the last time we had an actual, full length conversation. We didn't talk on the 12th. On the 13th, I had asked him how he was doing and he said he was ""good and just tired."" His response seemed off. We basically had no conversation that day and I haven't heard back from him since then. 

I was really emotional for the rest of August because I wasn't expecting him to be gone for this long and I was scared and anxious. Two weeks into no contact, I spammed him a little bit which I know I shouldn't have done but I was just frightened and concerned for him. In the same month, I noticed he used my Hulu (we share it) but he didn't watch a full episode, just a few minutes of it, and noticed his Snapchat points went up by 2 points and it made me think he could be shutting me out. I only checked because I was curious to see if he had used my Hulu yet because every time I checked, he hadn't used it, and I checked Snap to see if he had opened my snaps I sent in July. He isn't into social media, so think I should throw that out there. I asked his friend if she had heard from him lately and she said no, but the last time he was on Messenger was on the 16th of August. This all convinced me a little bit that he could possibly be shutting me out. I definitely know he wasn't lying to me about his wifi because it seems  like his wifi gets cut off every other month, but it made me think he didn't want to tell me something and chose to do what he usually does; shut me out. 

Here it is September and we haven't spoken to each other for almost an entire month. Today I saw he viewed my Snapchat story which made me happy because that meant he was alive. I knew he wasn't dead and still intact, but it was a relief seeing that sign of life after not talking to him for so long. He didn't return back to my messages though, so what do I do exactly? I mean, I feel like there's nothing I can do at this point except be patient and wait like I have been. I've been through his before with him, like we went a month or so with no contact early this year because of his family problems and his mental health problems. Why does he shut me out? I know one of the reasons is because he doesn't want to stress me out over his issues which won't ever be the case, but could there be more to this? It hurts me that he's alienating me and withdrawing himself. I don't think he knows how to deal with his emotions healthily and just himself in general. It also hurts me that he's in pain. Sometimes I get angry and frustrated, but not at him, but at his family due to how they treat him. I guess they love him, but why do they have to stress him out and make him feel awful? He's always been alone and home everyday. He doesn't have any type of support besides me. I've always been VERY patient with him and understanding. I never lash out on him because he can't help the way he is you know? I always reassure him and help him out as best as I can which I always succeed in thankfully. I'm afraid this will put a major toll on our relationship, but I'm not going to give up on him. I still have faith in us. Any advice? 

Feel free to ask any questions or ask for clarification/explanation, but please refrain from asking irrelevant/off topic questions like if he's a catfish which he is not, (He's told me a lot about his family and his sister knows me), personal questions about our relationship, just things like this. no homophobia please and nothing hateful.

24,"Hopefully this is allowed here but I'm wondering if anyone has had any experience with this in the past. 

Okay so currently I am in my fifth year of dealing with a hereditary mental illness, achieved from what as far as I can tell is from only being my father's son. 

I actually can't get into details about *what* this mental illness is but it's serious and even as an agnostic, I can admit that I've been blessed with the professional support I've received over the years coping with this. But it's still there. And unfortunately, it's here to stay. I've considered what some consider to be drastic responses including everything from lobotomy to castration to shock therapy to suicide and everything in between. 

Even intimate relationships with other people are a serious struggle. I've now decided that I'm never going to have a child. Which hurts. But I can't. I've wanted to have a son or daughter my whole life. But knowing that I have inherited it from my father and, to varying degrees, my siblings, it is neither safe or fair. I would never wish my day to day life on any other human being. 

So with all that in mind, I know I have to deal with this emotionally for the couple+ dozen or so remaining years or more of my fathers life and even mine. Upon realising that this was hereditary, I tried to take sympathy on him. But his negative qualities have become more evident to me in the last few years and like a good relationship going bad, I'm finding it harder and harder to even look at him. Now after years of getting on relatively well, I find almost everything he says grates on my skull like nails on a chalkboard. 

I need to deal with this. For both him *and* me. Or else I know that after he's gone, I will be haunted by whatever years I have left with, with regret.

34,"Christianity: the path to delusion and mental illness.

Without sharing my stories, i will say that through christianity i have broken down having the most horrifying delusions involving so called religious figures. It doesn't seem like I'm the only one to have been caught in that web.

Whilst many find christianity helpful, suffering no adverse side effects, it is still something that distorts even mildly a person's perception of reality. Through fear of eternal suffering to fearing there's a ghost at the foot of your bed, or even believing your car might start if you pray hard enough, it is a dangerous way to think. When you think about why, consider those examples.

This isn't a long message. Just a word of caution for anyone feeling like they must believe in that religion, whether it be through fear or insecurity to peer pressure.

I'll end with mentioning the (free) mental health service in the UK. Where do i start... A mental health nurse once said that ALL mental health practitioners use N.L.P on patients (neuro linguistic programming) something that i noticed to be true in dealing with them. Look it up, a dangerous tool for anyone to use. There's not much else i want to say except they are simply working on your mind, they're not 'helping'.

38,"I have always wondered if what happened to me counts as sexual abuse, but have been to scared to ask anyone. Can someone please help? 

Some information: I am currently an 18 y/o female. I have weird feelings about sex; either I feel hypersexual and am into being submissive (being choked, etc.) or I am completely turned off of sex. I don't know if this has anything to do with this. I am also anxious and occasionally depressed, I have a hard time keeping up relationships with people, friends or otherwise.

Now onto the actual events. My brother used to live with our family when I was little. He had ADD that drove my dad to be aggressive with him, something that I think really hurt him mentally. He (my brother) would sometimes take me down into the basement and tell me to touch him or touch me. There was never any actual penetration, but I remember he was always so focused on touching my chest and other areas, or having me touch his penis. He always told me that I couldn't tell anyone or else I would be in big trouble. One time he did try to engage in actual sex but I cried and he stopped. I only remember this all happening a couple times, but I maybe think it could have happened more? I do know that at the time I didn't know what sex was and didn't think there was anything weird about it. 

I did do things that (I now know) are signs of sexual abuse. I would make my friends play with toys in the way that my brother played with me. I drew sex parts on my life sized doll that my grandma had given me, which I got in a lot of trouble for. When I started developing breasts a couple years later I was really upset, almost wishing I was a boy so I wouldn't have them. 

I don't know. The thing is, we were both kids. I was 6-7 and he was 11. Every time I hear of sexual abuse it's always between an adult or teen and a child, not a child and a child. It kind of makes me feel like I'm being dramatic. My brother and I lost contact when he moved out, around age sixteen. I have never told anybody and never plan to, but I would really like to know if what happened counts as abuse.

I was just curious if anyone has dealt with what I'm going through, and I just really need some advice or inspiration. ",10Sep2017,5
41,"I'm a decent amateur football player. I have a reputation for being a nice, sporting guy which I am happy about. However, these last couple of months I have had several fights on the field. I have felt angry, whilst playing and when something happens to a team mate (like a dangerous tackle or an elbow being thrown) and the referee does nothing, I take it upon myself to challenge the opponent and it has ended in scraps. 

It's not how I like to play. But I've noticed that in my personal life I am getting more aggressive, often arguing with colleagues at work, or family members. I am a very depressive person but I have been for years I don't see why this should all of a sudden become a sympton. I am, probably for the first time in my life, worried that I am going to end up hurting someone through my anger. Does anyone know what can cause this sudden character trait? Is it a medical thing?",10Sep2017,2
