0,"Do people ever question your mental health? Recently I was in a youth mental hospital and an outpatient program where it felt like some people including my doctor thought I was faking it or maybe looking for attention. I honestly was heartbroken because I came to get help and then was treated like I was pretending but that's not what I was doing. I was doing what I always do, hiding it because I can't bear to deal with my problems. There have been times where people asked if I self harm or have I tried to kill myself, I said no. Then literally everyone else went to talk about their own suicide attempts and self harm; which isn't a problem then it started to bug me that maybe I am doing this for attention. I know it's not true because what people don't see is the constant mental struggle I go through everyday and how hard I fight to hide all of it. The hard part is the nagging feeling that I'll never be happy enough nor depressed enough to fit in anywhere; I just feel empty.",14Feb2017,3

2,"Hey guys
So here it is ,for the past few years now I've had certain moments in life when reality gets warped and everything seems very odd for example: I've noticed while biking and walking that there is a kind of hexagonal pattern in the road , like its a treadmill,also that it feels I'm actually laying down in a bed , even if im moving,standing or sat up right but along with these moments is a definite voice that's telling me that ""non of this is real , everything is a lie , your are being lied too ,WAKE UP"" i know this sounds weird but it does feel like im dreaming all of this , everything ,that this whole world and way of life is a lie, that infact im in some sort of coma or something in a hospital bed and someone is actually trying to talk to me but I wont wake up. there's never been a confirmed trigger for these moments, could be a song , a piece of text , or just sitting somewhere having a quiet drink it changes everytime , just not sure what to do anymore ",14Feb2017,4
3,"background: 28 yr old female with history of anxiety/panic disorder and chronic depression which is made worse with PMDD. recently been overcome with symptoms and unable to function/handle life. i feel some of the problem may be due to trauma and acceptance of chronic illnesses.

 long history with antidepressants/moodstabilizers/benzos. have dealt with chronic pain/illness for 10+ years, recently have received a multitude of diagnosis' for autoimmune/genetic conditions. 

struggling with compulsive suicidal thoughts, have had a past of self harm and suicidal ideation but no true attempts. 

have done a week stay in a state hospital when panic disorder first got bad at 18 yrs old. didn't have much success but felt ""crazier"" in the environment of addicts/severely disturbed. 

a few years ago did an outpatient program (Four Winds) in NY state. DBT and group therapy with one on one therapy every few days. was told to not smoke weed/drink and drug tested after I told them that i smoked daily. 


QUESTION: need specific places (names of facilities) that people have felt were more helpful than hurtful. very worried about feeling worse being in an inpatient environment but hoping that in the riht program i could be helped. 

really don't want to be forced onto medication. i have recently done TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) for my conditions because of the amount side effects I feel from any medication. i have stayed on xanax for occasional use with panic attacks and take a very low dose of klonopin to prevent panic from building. 

unsure if i need a substance abuse program. i don't abuse any substances other than marijuana but have been using it daily for many years as a way to cope in addition to managing chronic pain/nausea. i feel it may be helpful for me to not use it daily but am kind of worried i may not be able to do it.

4,"I am currently in the cycle of: I suffer from anxiety but I'm anxious to tell people, especially someone who might help, which leads me to feel even more anxious because I feel anxious. Help?

I just got hired for a new job starting in June and I'm excited but my anxiety has been through the roof since then and I don't know what to do to handle it. I don't want to be medicated but at the same time none of the coping mechanisms I had used before are working.

6,"I'm 30 years old going back to college for a second bachelor's in something I always wanted to do.

However my mental health hasn't been the best. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and hospitalized voluntarily once. I opted to get ECT to help me deal with depression. 

The ECT helped and I currently take two anti depression medications.

However recently to go to this college required moving six hours from my parents. I have worked jobs before, take care of my chores etc. but never lived on my own. I've been here for 30 days and I haven't seen my parents for three weeks.

I find myself feeling very very sad here in this new place. Despite having made a few friends already what I need is the hug of my mom or dad or brother.

I was recently also broken up with, we dated for one year and we both made mistakes and we were very close. Losing her made me feel very alone especially. She lives back in my old town six hours away.

I find myself very depressed without daily interaction with people I'm very close with. I need day to day interaction with my mom or dad or brother or up to recently my ex. 

Now here I am all alone in this apartment six hours away and though I have met people. It does nothing to cure the sadness inside me. It only goes away when people I love are in my life day to day.

Because of how sad I am, I can no longer focus on my school work and I've lost motivation to study and exert myself.

I want to go home, go back to my parents get a job and perhaps date and move out once I've found somebody to do that with.

My sadness is getting to breakdown levels and random crying and talking to myself.

Should I go home or push myself to adapt and try and cope for at least six months? It's just I feel so sad day to day don't know what to do. Don't want to give up my dream either.

This blank expression and monotone voice has gotten me a lot of flak over the years, especially being a young pretty female. I try hard to come off the right way but it's very tiring. The Viibryd seems to be helping me a bit. I'm just frustrated because I have been fired from many jobs and gotten in trouble in college for seeming ""rude, disinterested, apathetic, cold"", etc.

9,I went to my therapist earlier this week and one of the things he mentioned is that something I could do is make a mood journal. I really think it's a good idea but it's been difficult for me. I use to write a lot when I was younger. I enjoyed writing and had even won awards for it. But then one day I came home from school and my mom brother and sister had mentioned to me things they only would have known if they had read my journal (which I later found out they did.) and I just feel like a car struggling to drive when it comes to writing. I don't know if I will ever feel like I can write again. But I want to keep track of my mood throughout the day like my therapist recommended I try.

11,"I've had debilitating Major Depressive Disorder and various anxiety disorders (OCD, social anxiety, and panic disorder) for two decades. I was in a decade long depressive episode until about a year and a half ago when I started a new medicine (in conjunction with regular therapy and using my CBT skills regularly). 

I am in a partial remission right now which is more than I could have ever imagined really. I started a very part time job a few weeks ago. I'm doing things that I didn't think was possible (riding the bus by myself, answering phones left and right, being in public a lot, having an activity outside my apartment every day that I have to get up and dressed for). 

I'm doing alright right now. But I'm terrified of when things get worse again. I know it's going to happen eventually because I'm disabled because of my mental illnesses and they are chronic conditions. 

I don't want to push myself too far but I'm feeling pretty good with what I'm doing right now. But how will I know when I need to back off and stop pushing myself? I know my early warning signs but they also were my signs when I was in a depressive episode but I was going deeper into it...how do I know what the ones from partial remission to relapse are?

13,"I don't want to waste money but my parents leave me no choice. The won't let me drop for the semester. I feel like drowning and I have no where to go. No one understands the struggle I'm going through. I can't call in sick at school, they don't allow that.

I'm planning on going on a day trip to the beach tomorrow to get things out of my mind. The guidance counselor doesn't help. Getting things out of my chest doesn't help anymore, all I'm getting are

""Uni is hard. Deal with it."" ""Your education is important."" ""How's school going? Are you sure you're going to classes?"" ""What you want to do is too much."" ""Don't hurt yourself/Don't kill yourself."" ""Stop crying/feeling like that."" 

It feels like they're incredibly selfish. Even if I have a child of my own, I'd rather give them a break to have them sort their selves out rather than make them wish they're dead (which could possibly make them snap and do commit suicide, in my case I'm so close in committing an attempt again)

They won't take me seriously. I think I'm going to have to mutilate myself for them to know that there's something wrong. I should be doing school work right now rather than posting this on reddit. I should be giving my all in passing since the program I picked is really hard (Chemical Engg) but holycrap, when will it get through to the people around me that I'M FUCKING STRUGGLING WITH EVERYTHING.

Also, fuck Uni and their money-based system. I inquired about dropping but I still have to pay the full tuition regardless of circumstances. I could be dead and my parents still have to pay for my tuition. I feel selfish as well for giving up like this but I can't hold on any longer.",14Feb2017,1

I don't have the option of taking a semester of since my scholarship is restricted to four years. Nonetheless, I am continually waking up in a panic and consistently talk myself out of attending school, and with several teachers with heavily weighted participation grades, I fear that this will damage my chances of scholarship renewal.

24,"Hi guys

My ex-girlfriend is currently in the UK and I am in Dubai. She has suffered with anxiety/depression for quite a while now, and unfortunately I just couldn't handle the stress of it all and coupled with an offer that was just too good to turn down for the future of my career, I moved to Dubai.

We toyed with the idea of her coming out here and starting a life but never set anything in stone (I am not sure if the feeling are there from my side, something I have told her). Her mum has tried to take her own life quite a few times but now my ex has finally tried to take her own life.

She has cut herself a few times on her stomach and arms when she couldn't get in touch with me etc, however last night was the final straw. Long story short she made a few suicide notes and took a bunch of pills and is now in the hospital, stable but still serious.

Obviously I can't give her the help she needs. I thought it was for attention initially as she would send me the pictures of the cuts but last night was obviously more serious. What do I do? Do I drop everything in Dubai and fly back to try and help her through it or do I leave that to the professionals? I really don't know how to deal with the stress of it all and I don't know if I could deal with the burden if she were to take her own life, the guilt would eat me up.

26,"I'm feeling very scared at the moment and have been feeling so for a number of weeks, possibly longer, though these feelings appear to fluctuate in intensity every so often; and just now they were at their most potent I've ever felt. I feel like a cornered animal. I experience overwhelming, almost completely incapacitating terror at the drop of a hat. That's the only way I can describe it. I feel as if everyone is out to get me, and one minor change in my environment can suddenly set me off and cause my heart to race, my hands to sweat and my mind to panic. At work recently a new guy joined and as soon as I made eye contact with him I was terrified. If I hear people talking I have to eavesdrop in case they're plotting against me. If I hear someone walking outside I have to peer out through the curtains. I can't stop myself from being scared. I try to use logic to convince myself that I'm acting irrationally but it simply doesn't work. I can't stop these feelings, and the fact that no matter what I do seems to help is making me even more scared. Because during the times when the feelings are most intense I genuinely seem to believe that these people really are after me, and that I'm not acting irrationally. Like now that I've kind of calmed down I still feel these feelings except right now I know it's an irrational feeling, though in the back of my mind the thoughts are still niggling away and it's really stressing me out. But when something triggers my mind to blow up with these thoughts I really do get intensely scared and actually believe that people are after me. And not just scared, I mean literally almost paralysed with fear. Even songs on the radio scare me, for example I heard a song and I had to Google the lyrics because the words I heard it say were different to how I remember the lyrics, and I thought these words must have had some meaning for me specifically and have been aimed at me as an individual because everyone else in the room was just going about their daily business and listening to the song without reacting to the lyrics - so I think I must've been the only one to notice that they'd changed. And it wasn't just a slight difference in the lyrics either. Well it was only a few words that changed but they were completely opposite to how they should have been ('hate' instead of 'love' etc). So yeah, I've been feeling really scared but I've not told anyone and don't feel like I can talk to anyone in person. And since I can't find any way to solve this I've been trying to escape by indulging heavily in things such as sex/masturbation and drinking. And it's not working, in fact it's made it worse. Sorry, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to mention my sexuality here so I'll keep it brief (skip to the next paragraph if ypu don't want to read it) but I'm a straight male but I'm quite sexually submissive and now I've started to feel as if women (and people in general) don't see me as a real man and are talking about me behind my back etc - even women that I've never even spoken to, let alone been intimate with. So I've become really withdrawn over the past few weeks, not really wanting to interact with people. And I've even been having suicidal thoughts lately, especially when I feel really bad like recently. I cry a lot too, and don't know what to do with myself. I've also had thoughts like this for a few years though, starting long before these feelings appeared. 

So yeah, that's it. Is there anything I can do about this by myself or should I seek help from a therapist? I did actually speak to one friend over the internet (we live in different countries for now) about this and he suggested that I could have paranoia, which got me thinking about schizophrenia. But I don't like the idea of self diagnosing at all and (please correct me if I'm wrong) thought that paranoid schizophrenics weren't aware that they were thinking irrationally. I am aware most of the time that these thoughts are irrational, though that doesn't stop them from causing me great distress and at times overwhelming me to the point where I believe my thoughts are right and not irrational. 

Can anyone please offer anyone insight? Or give me any help with dealing with my situation? I'm going to sleep now and will check back sometime tomorrow. Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read and reply. ",14Feb2017,2

38,"Im a 19 year old male and feel like i'm going crazy. Im not sure if this is the right place but I need somewhere to post and this seemed at least similar. I'm terrified of self diagnosing, and am looking more for guidance on whether I should take further steps to seeking help. So i'm hoping you all can help me, and I apologize if this is breaking any rules. Have you ever have one of those moments where something clicks and you realize your behavior is not like everyone else? Well that just happened. I've finally decided to compile a list after almost 2 years of promising I would. Just feel like I've hit my breaking point and could use someone to talk to, although I don't have anyone close enough I could even begin to talk to about something like this. Hence, reddit. So here it is, I guess I just need to get it off my chest.

1: This is what I find the most concerning personally. I have an intense desire to write down every single though I have. I'm terrified I'll forget whatever revelation I come up with, and the worst part is I've been doing this for over a year and have never even ONCE gone back to read my notes. Theres just too many and it is overwhelming.

2: Since moving out, my room is spotless. If something is in the wrong place I can't relax. Which ties into point 3.

3: Ill sit down to relax, and after about 2-5 minutes, notice something isn't ""Perfect."" So ill get up, change the lighting, sit back down. Then 3 minutes later, get up, open a window, sit back down. Repeat 5-8 times until my setting is perfect and I can finally relax. (I've noticed my dad has similar behavior, he is ALWAYS fidgeting with something and constantly gets up when we try to watch a movie.)

4: Following conversations is incredibly difficult because I'm constantly worrying that I did some minute thing to disrupt it. For example, the other day my friend was telling me a story and the entire time all I could think about was the fact that he may want a sip from my water bottle (I've realized now that I consistently interrupt people for these completely random interjections)

5: Speaking of interruptions, I finish peoples sentences quite often before they are done talking for them.

6: I tend to bounce around friends, getting very overwhelmed if I spend too long with someone, and need plenty of time all to myself to feel like I can even function in society. Conversations are exhausting even though I love them.

7: In a group setting, I and extremely overwhelmed. I hate having to micromanage every side conversation, and feel like person B will resent me for ignoring them when i'm already talking to person A. So ill typically sush both people, and have to regain control of whats happening in order to not be completely engulfed. I also feel like I have to respond when someone makes a remark no one hears. All in all, 1-1 interactions are exponentially more enjoyable.

8: Going back to relaxing, I often will be drawing or talking and have a need to look away quickly, almost like a muscular spasm. Then just pick right back up with what I was doing.

9: Regarding hobbies, I fear commitment (Although not at all in a relationship). For example, I've been watching the same tv show for over 3 years since I can't commit 20 minutes to a show (Don't even get me started on a 2 hour long movie!) So my hobbies are all short things that I can pick up and drop quickly (Origami, drawing etc.) But it is so exhausting watching the same 10 minutes of a movie for the 6th time only to lose interest. I also feel like i'm wasting time if i'm not multitasking. ""I only have 7 hours before bed, so I should draw, and watch a movie, but I want to listen to music, guess I'll mute the movie and do all 3."" Then I get bored and change tasks after 10 minutes. I also get really into things for a short amount of time then drop them, typically spending lots of money on these hobbies.

10: I tend to hypothetically have conversations before they actually happen, going over each and every possible scenario to ensure I get it right. For example, Ill know that I want to go get coffee with jake tomorrow, so ill think about our conversations, what I want to talk about, etc. This typically ends up with me fumbling over my words trying to get bits and pieces from 6 ""conversations"" I have already had with this exact person.

Again, I'm really sorry if this is the wrong place, and would love recommendations for somewhere else to go if it is. But even just writing it down helps me feel like I'm not actually crazy, but these are real symptoms that need to be addressed. Thanks.

43,"So I'm at college, in my second year. During my first year, I had a lot of mental issues due to family problems, so I did the logical thing and sought help from our school counselors. Even though I'd heard a lot of people say they were awesome, my experience was...not great. The first counselor I had ate lunch during every session (which made me think either she didn't care much or was being overworked by the school, neither of which is great) and after a semester of sessions, I hadn't felt we'd gotten anywhere. Maybe it was just me being paranoid and shut away, but I lied to her and pretended I was doing better just so she wouldn't press me to get therapy from her again.

Later that year, I was having some really disturbing thoughts and applied again for therapy, asking specifically for a different therapist. I told them I was having irrational sexual thoughts and some fears of assault (which is also strange because I've never been assaulted, but that's a different topic), and you know what they did? They gave me a male counselor. (I'm female, I guess I should mention.) So there I was shut in a small room with this older guy, and I knew from the first session that this wasn't going to work. 

The only good thing about that counselor was that he gave me an ADD screening and I found out I am on the spectrum, if barely, which maybe is part of my problems. But they couldn't ""officially"" diagnose me...probably because they're only designed to deal with stress, despite what they tell you.

I applied a third time, and after a few miscommunications the office and I stopped communicating. I felt they didn't really care.

So here's my problem. Obviously I'm quite ticked with my school counselors, and have no desire to go back. But, I still would like someone professional to talk issues over with. Someone competent. Unfortunately, neither my family nor I have the means to pay for a professional counselor.

I've had relationships before, 3, all three cheated on me. This has made me too suspicious, and I struggle with it. It makes me insecure about myself and my worth towards my SO. And this affects my SO's feelings towards me, and pushing my SO away.
Truth be told, I don't get a lot of physical remarks from my SO, and this makes me think I'm not valued in that way, and that my SO seeks the physical somewhere else. Sex is great, but I always has to initiate it. Got told to leave it to my SO sometimes, but then my SO asks if something is wrong since I don't try. 
Is there anyway I can work with myself, overcome my insecurity and  believe I am of worth to my SO? Any tips, methods etc? 
Much appreciated. ",14Feb2017,1

50,"I think I might have a personality disorder... not sure what kind however. I feel empty so empty it is a physical cold emptiness, yet my mood and my emotional state feels very stormy like a boat in a storm, up and down, up and down and round and round. It is not cyclical though it isn't happy-sad/manic-depressed it is faster than that every other day, or just half a day, emotions in chaos from one moment to the next. Yet despite this I feel totally detached, like I'm numb.

I have these angry outbursts, moments of rage, or just being as sadistically mean as possible, I'm usually very empathetic, too empathetic, yet in those moments, I feel I have to defend myself, mercilessly so I use empathy to stab exactly where I know it hurts.

I keep having this recurring thought where I slice off my face, I mean it doesn't feel real, I maintain this air of transparency, people think I one thing, I'm not that thing, I want to be free.

The one person I can say I loved, really did care for her, not sure I can for anyone else now, that developmental window has closed. I could only think about sex with her or women general in terms of violence, her pain and suffering, yet I would never hurt her, and this has been like this since I was 12/13. The night before last I dreamed of violently assaulting her, raping her, she was so warm, everything else was cold, I was freezing, could have just have easily cuddled her, I don't know why I dreamed that, especially as the last thing I saw before it ended was her dead body, not sure how that happened.

I'm scared I'm a psychopath, I have horrible problems with intimacy, attachment (hence the dream, warmth hmm), never a smiling photo of me, that said never murdered any animals, I love my dog, she's lovely. I scare most potential relationships away. Especially the person I really needed it from, it was my fault, over the years I expressed my feelings towards her, she thought I was being horrible and hateful, so I don't know how I got things that distorted, I knew I was pretty messed up but not that bad. (Ps. not a stalker, we knew each other well, she knew what I was like, pretty codependent, each taking turns in codependency). When I finally got things straight with her recently, we're too distant now, bloody tragic that, codepedency slipped back, except she has more self-esteem now so when her turn came, after my self-destructively supportive time, she informed me she ain't my mother haha, before that it was nice, really nice.

I like to think I am too guilt ridden to be a psychopath, I'm something else, I self-destruct, occasionally self-harm to control myself. I feel like this is all really bad, I feel like I should feel like this is a crisis, but I feel fine. ",14Feb2017,1
53,"Hey folks!

Something occured the other day at work that was bad enough to send me home early.  I thought it was a full-blown anxiety attack, but my father, a clinician, says that it sounds like anxiety might have only been partially involved.

What happene first ws only about an hour of sleep, and I open at the restraint at which I work, do I'm up at four or four-thirty.  Such little sleep isn't especially uncommon for me, but it definitely doesn't happen every day.

Next was, in order to combat my fatigue, the consumption of several servings of coffee.

Lack of sleep plus high caffeine intake together can have an effects on the mind, but I'm jot sure they were the culprit of what happened, because I have had less sleep and more caffeine before and no attacks such as I'm about to describe, but they likely didn't help.

From five until about eleventh, my mood became increasingly depressed and dark, as did my thoughts.  My thoughts have always been fast and disorganised, but in this instance, that speed and lack of control increased more and more 

My thoughts are always exploring abstract concepts and pondering existentialism.  Not sure why; that's just what I'm inclined to think about.

This day was no different, save for the matter if my thoughts.  I'm jot exactly comfortable with sharing what exactly passed through my head, but suffice it to say, they centered around me slightly losing my mind, around death, around the terrible catastrophe I often feel I sense coming, which can be the Second Coming of Christ, the clampdown of something like the New World Order, a massive war that will have me drafted, etc.

Images of my wife being brutally killed were also a focus.

These things and more kept fighting fore attention until they all came and went so quickly that I couldn't even discern any of them.  Multiple voices, all mine, were all saying things at once, mostly in English, but also oddly enough a constructed language I am working on.

I was sent out for a smoke break after my coworkers noticed me pacing I the kitchen, holding my skull tightly and covering my ears with my elbows.

I knew something was very wrong, so I didn't even finish my cigarette. I walked in andntolf my GM as calmly as possible that I thought I was having an anxiety attack, and that I didn't know what to do l.

It was then that I just broke down in tears.  I didn't even feel particularly sad or even afraid; I just...felt.  Everything.  I tried to focus on an object, but that didn't work.  I then in just went to the office, sobbing, with massive amounts of energy.  I kept pounding the desk, pulling at my hair, balling my fists tight enough to draw blood from myself palms, and the like.

I have had something happen like this before l, but then there was a definite fear, and no tears.

Worth mentioning that before came inside, a sudden but very subtle wave of intense self-loathing came over me, and I felt that there was nothing I could to to stop my slow descent into madness, and that I was going to end up hurting someone, and that I should go somewhere and never interact with another human again, and jus lt wait for God or the Devil to kill me nd drag my pathetic soul into forever.

My dad says that while anxiety may have been invved, most of it might have just been a simple breakdown at the intense bombardment of all these dark thoughts, and that my intelligence (his words not mine), has me overanalyzing everything and considering everybpossiblr variable, so my emotions were just a reaction, and bot much connected to any underlying anxiety issues.

Thoughts?  

Cheers!

54,"I don't know what's wrong with me recently. Last week my mum got slightly irritated at me for putting a jumper that wasn't dirty in the laundry and I burst into tears. Today my mum and sister accused me of saying that I don't want children even though I NEVER recall saying anything along those lines. I had to leave the room immediately or else I would've honestly punched one of them. I sat in my room and cried about it for hours. This is bothering me because these are such small insignificant things that you would normally just brush off, and I don't feel it warrants this extreme reaction. It's just so irrational.

Does anyone else share this kind of experience?",14Feb2017,3
55,"In my third year of university (about 1.5 years ago) I was very depressed. It had many causes but one of the triggers was that I was too attached to my best friend, I guess I became unhealthily co-dependent on her as we were so close. I almost ruined our friendship due to my mental health but I had therapy and medication and felt like I recovered. 
However, I have been feeling the same thought patterns have been creeping back into my mind, the same toxic thoughts that nobody likes me, and that my best friend prefers other people to me. I work full time but her and our other housemate are nurses and have a lot of free time to do fun things together; little things keep setting me off and I can feel myself going down the same route. For example, I found out that the two of them are going skiing in 2 weeks, neither of them asked me even though I could get the time off work. I keep thinking about it and crying and working myself up into an anxious mess. I have this horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach and I just don't know what to do. I know therapy is a good idea but I don't have access to it immediately and even then I feel like I'm just being silly. I have thought about removing myself from the situation by looking to live elsewhere but it's not practical. I really need some advice, or maybe some exercises I can do to clear my mind? I really think I'll lose her this time as it's hard for her to deal with me, and I know it's my fault that she gets upsets when I talk to her about things. Thanks for any help. ",14Feb2017,1
57,"So i went to my psychologist office today after years of not going for new medication because I have been really bad lately, but after mentioning my symptoms and my dwi (ALMOST A FUCKING YEAR AGO) she started only asking about my alcohol use??!? and forgot all about my symptoms and all i fucking wanted was a diagnosis and meds because i have neither rn and have no clue what is going on with me. but instead of either of those she told me i needed intensive out patient treatment for WHAT?! I DONT KNOW!! then told me if i dont comply i cannot see her anymore... do i need a new psychologist or do i need to go to IOP? i DO NOT have the time or recourses to attend these meetings and have no clue why im going as i am not diagnosed with anything. I just really need advice because im going out of my mind. ",14Feb2017,1
