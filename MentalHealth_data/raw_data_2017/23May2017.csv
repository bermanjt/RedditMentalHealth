1,"I've been feeling very.. ""stupid"" lately?

I was an honors student in college. I've always been able to pick things up very easily (when learning something new), especially in the medical field where I've been working for about 7 years. But lately, I've been making so many dumb mistakes. Missing small but important details. Messing up or not being able to understand or explain things I always used to pride myself on understanding. And even while not at work, (proving it isn't work related, just a good example for me to explain) I've been losing my train of thought, dropping things, and forgetting things. Sometimes (only happened twice within the last year) my mind just goes ""blank"" and I can't even ""think"". Which is hard to explain, but basically I can't speak or think or tell someone what's happening -and it can happen mid convo. And it's scary as fuck because while it's happening I swear to you I can't even explain it and I start to cry because it's petrifying. But again -it only happened twice.

--

Just wondering what someone thinks this could be. I know some might say anxiety or something like that, but this has been going on for a solid few months, slowly -gradually. And getting worse.. Definitely a lot more the last two months. It's just been harder for me to comprehend things lately.

I also used to be very good at sudoku, and lately I can't even finish a puzzle because I can't focus or comprehend what I'm even doing and almost forget how to play..?

Is this something serious enough to get checked out? I mean, I'm about 90% sure I'm going to make an appointment anyway, but not sure with who. A primary care? A therapist? Psychologist? Psychiatrist? Neurologist???

--

I used to seriously pride myself on being intelligent, and lately I haven't been feeling like that. I just hope it's nothing serious.

I guess I'm either looking for someone to tell me to get it checked or someone to tell me it's nothing or maybe even someone who's been in the same boat or I don't actually even know what I'm looking for. Just. Something.

Well, thanks in advance!


TL;DR
Lately I've been feeling like a complete idiot. Please help me figure out why, or give me possible solutions/answers/anything you think will help me figure this out and fix it. Thanks!",23May2017,2,

5,"I always thought I was really introspective and that I knew my mental health well.  I can trace back why I have XYZ problems to ABC occurrence from my childhood, but the fact that I have severe mood swings went completely over my head somehow.  Doctors asked me and I said ""not really"" and meant it, even though I go from actively suicidal to completely fine in a couple of hours, happy and in a good mood to furious and short with everyone in the same day.  They're severe and frequent, and I had no idea.

I guess I thought it was normal, because it's all I've ever known.  That seems to be a theme with me.  I didn't know I had sensory problems because I never knew that wasn't normal.  I didn't know I was abused because I never knew otherwise.   I didnt know it was weird to pray fifty times every night until I grew up and looked back on it.

Im 25 and started opiates when i was 15, by 16 i was doing black tar... Ive been in an out of methadone clinics 3 times (first time after renal failure from anti psychotic mediacation). 

That stuff doesn't matter atm. Ive been clean but the conversations im having in my mind are scaring me a lot.

Ive only been off benzodiazepines for 4 monthes after 6 years and i assume its rebound anxiety? ",23May2017,5,

8,"One thing that runs through my mind, more then my brain reminding myself I need to drink water, is that I might forget. Not just forget where I put my keys or my wallet because I misplace those things all the time and it doesn't bother me. When I say forget things I mean forgetting a book I just finished, forgetting words that were just said to me when I knew I was paying attention, forgetting the lesson I just heard, forgetting my family, forgetting my name, forgetting who I am, the list goes on.

Sometimes I get so anxious and paranoid of how good/bad I am at storing memories and keeping them safe I have a panic attack. These things usually happen in my oh so fun place of education. Sitting around peers, letting myself think too much. I end up having irrational thoughts that slowly escalate to a point where I almost start crying mid lecture. 

I usually abandon just my last class if I just need a little breathing space, but when it gets really bad, I have to miss about four classes or three. I don't do it intentionally I just end up freaking out and disassociating for longer then I want to. I haven't been diagnosed with anything yet, I haven't went to a psychiatrist or anything, I'm a little afraid of going there. That they might prescribe me meds that make me feel like shit or diagnose me with some crazy shit that I never even guessed I would have. 

I don't know what's worse, knowing you have something wrong with you or not knowing and wondering all the goddamn time.

So if anyone has any idea why I'm so scared of forgetting or if anyone can relate comments would be very, very appreciated.",23May2017,1,

11,"Hi all. This is my first post ever. I am desperate and didn't know where else to go.

I am a young professional (late 20s) living several hundred miles away from home. Ever since I was a kid, I remember my mother getting depressed every Christmas, and I really mean every single one. She wouldn't talk to my dad all season long, every single year... She would come into my room crying in the middle of the night, I didn't know what was going on, I just felt bad for her. (Some background: I am the oldest of 2) She is a great mom, very caring and loving.

I was 15 the first time she attempted suicide, we were supposed to go on a family vacation but she backed out last minute so she stayed. We found our upon our return that she had taken a lot of pills. Not too long after that my parents divorced which to me was for the better.

Years went by, she was doing great, no meds, met someone during a manic episode but they stayed together and all was good for a few years. I went to college, I graduated no issues, Christmas were better, until I met my significant other and found my dream job and moved away.

This is were it gets bad... Not a year went by when I was visiting and she attempted against her life again. I found her. She started treatment, got better for a while. It's been 5 years now and another 2 attempts, one of them very serious, I am surprised she is still with us. I happened to be in vacation when it happened away from her and without communication. I have a vacation scheduled to visit her, and guess who is having an episode again? I feel like she is just trying to ruin anything good that happens to me. I haven't been able to go on a vacation were I can truly relax. I dread going home to visit. Now she wants to move in with me and my husband, ruin the one healthy relationship that I have. 

I have never been so anxious in my life, having to deal with her is so exhausting, but I love her so much and I could not forgive myself of something happens.

15,"I have been searching for answers as to what has been gradually happening to my mind over the last 3 years. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to learn anything from my mother, my friends or any mental health professionals I have spoken to. I'm hoping somebody here will be able to shed some light on my situation or at least may have experienced something similar. 

As it stands, I feel as though I am losing my mind. Not in the typical sense, though. 
I don't see things that aren't there, I don't hallucinate, although I am subject to paranoia from time to time.
My affliction is quite different. 
As little as 3 years ago If I'm being honest I was quite outgoing, witty and intelligent. Nowadays I'm much different, but not just in social aspects. Ironically, one of the side affects of whatever is going on is that I now find it incredibly difficult to describe things. Once I try to concentrate on something, my thoughts on it vanish. It's almost as if my brain has run out of ram and can only process one thing at a time- any hesitation or further planning in my head and the original/potential thoughts are gone. 

Because of this, I'll briefly outline what's goin on

-lose my train of thought often
-find Smalltalk difficult
-struggle to learn new things
-no longer form strong memories
-no longer feel connected with people
-dont enjoy my relationships
-constantly forget everything. I can't remember who I spoke to yesterday or anything I spoke about with them. Before i would remember every tiny detail of conversation, I felt I had a pretty good memory. 
-can no longer visualize things
-can no longer multitask
-can no longer solve simple problems and grasp concepts mentally without pen/paper
-forget to explain what I'm thinking about in my head before talking then people don't understand
-struggle to explain things
-can no longer plan even 2 moves ahead in chess, I forget
-very bad balance
-forget how to walk unconsciously, i move my legs weird now it's like I forgot how I used to walk around the place
-much more solitary person, used to constantly want to be around people
-get no joy from sitting with a group of friends or heading out anymore, kind of just want to go home and be alone, but I'm worried about being lonely in the future. 

I just feel a lot less intelligent than I did last year, the year before and the year before that. It's gradually getting worse. All of these things are new to me, I was quite extroverted through my late teens.


The weird thing is, and I feel like this may be and indication to something, is that I previously experienced what I do now in every day life when I was extremely high on drugs. 
If I had taken MDMA and then smoked a lot of weed, I would similarly lose my train of thought if I hesitated to think about what I was saying, like I do now.

When I took acid, after coming up on it I would find things incredibly difficult to explain to others, the words just aren't there to give, even though I have an extensive vocabulary.

Taking too much ketamine makes it hard to think, and the weed would give me slight memory issues and all of that which typically comes with it anyway. It's as if now I'm experiencing all those negatives from all the different substances at once while I'm sober. Which is crazy to me now that I put it into perspective like that. But I dont know what's going on.

 I feel as though my mind has become foggy. 
Before college I was bright and had a silver tongue. I got into university without studying for my exams, kinda always got by, people were naturally drawn to me it seemed. Then at some point things changed. 

Initially I thought it was because of drugs. 

I started smoking weed at 15 and tried ecstasy at 16. They were making regular monthly appearances until I was about 17, when it then became more of a weekly thing. 
By college at 18, I was smoking almost every day and taking MDMA at least 2 or 3 nights a week. Acid and Ketamine made an appearance every now an then, nothing habitual, but I feel it may be important to note, which I'll get to. 
By the time I was 19 I had my own place and was smoking about 7grams of weed in a day (€90) and I was smoking every day. I had excess income for the time so money was not a problem. 

Now, I know that something has changed. I'm just not who I used to be at all - my gf doesn't notice because I met her when everything had already changed. But, I do notice all of my friends from before gradually all stopped hanging out with me over time. I only smoke now, maybe take MDMA 3 or 4 times a year max but its only a few times per week now.

My first conclusion was that perhaps my brain had been a little fried due to overusing MDMA, but I know lots of people who party more than me and don't see loss of cognitive function, in my experience it also helps people become more sociable.

My second conclusion was that it had to be the constant smoking, so I cut it out. I know weed affects cognitive function, so I did see a difference when it came to remembering where I left things and stuff. Been smoking seldomly the past few months but I actually feel kind of dumber if anything, while my friends who smoke constantly these days are still slow stoners, but say they don't experience the stuff I do.

After that I thought it's gotta be schizophrenia brought about by the constant smoking. I'm on the fence with this currently. I went to a mental health professional but she said i have a foliate deficiency, which apparently explains what im experiencing, but a quick Google search will show that it's quite unrelated, I think she just wanted to tick my box and send me on my way unfortunately.

Finally I thought it could be acid, the only lines I can draw with this is that after my first bad trip was when I started to feel isolated from people I know, like we weren't on the same page, the subsequent 3 times I tripped all ended on bad notes, and it's hard to tell but I definitely feel like my mind became hazier after each subsequent trip.

Like I said, I find it incredibly hard to describe things, it has taken me many hours and attempts to try and write this. I would love if anybody has any info, advice or experience to share. I'd really like to find out the cause of this and potentially get back to where I used to be, I'm 21 but honestly feel like my mind is slipping away as I gradually find it more difficult to do the things that I once took for granted.

Thank you for reading.

16,"I've been making posts on a few subs like this as of lately, and it's been helping. And other activity online has also lead to me realizing that I need more help than I ever thought. 

I don't want to go into every detail of my past again, but in brief: I've been depressed since I a little kid, I rely on deep immersion into fantasy to cope with my loneliness, I've been hospitalized for a suicide attempt before, and now I feel like I am splitting in two. 

I can deal with suicidal thoughts for the most part. I'm so used to them. But now I want to hurt others. I do not have a plan to hurt anyone, but my mind is pounding with violence. I obsess over videos on 
r/watchpeopledie. And I've never been like that before. I used to hate seeing others suffer in anyway. But this is bringing me so much pleasure and release. Meds never did anything. Drugs, vices, and people make me care less about my pain, but watching these videos of suicide, murder, and torture actually calm me down wonderfully. 

I thought everyone on that sub was like me. I thought these urges and feelings that have come into my life were normal. But -- I made a comment on one of my favorite videos about how the sound of the man bleeding-out was the most soothing things I could think of. People in the comments let me know that most people there have a morbid curiosity. They told me that if I'm getting off and relaxing at such suffering that I really need help. 

I hate so much, and I am so afraid. My heart is shrinking. The hippy kids at my college all like me because they say I walk around with the brightest smile -- I'm jovial, I hear. But I'm walking around everyday with whatever mask I need. I have to cover up my rage, sadness, and my violent urges (both thoughts on myself and others). 

I'm afraid to go back to a hospital. I was treated so poorly last time. I know you will all think I am lying at this part, but I was yelled at every day while admitted. I was told that because of the mistake that put me in there, that I would never find love, success, or even a proper home. I now know that this was malpractice -- but whatever, it hurt badly, and I don't want to be trapped in a building where I can't get one second of fresh air my whole time there, or where I have to take medication that they refuse to explain to me. 

I know I may end up needing or having to go to one. I get that that will not be entirely up to me. 

What advice I am even asking for? I barely know. But what do I do? What do I say. The only thing I want is to be a good man. I hate being evil and depressed. I hate myself for being so disgusting and so much of a loser. I WANT TO BE A GOOD MAN. 

Can I trust a hospital again? Was my experience a fluke? I'm home for the summer, and I plan to find a counselor to start talking to tomorrow. But what do I do? Is someone like me a doomed cause? 

Please. Please help. Please give me some advice. I need it. Thanks. ",23May2017,6,

I'm looking into online therapy options because therapy isn't available to me locally (I live overseas and I don't know enough of the local language or culture to see a therapist here). A really good friend recommended TalkSpace to me. It looks like a really good option for me, since I need flexible hours and it's something I can do remotely. The problem is the price tag. It costs almost 10% of my monthly income, and I have no way of getting insurance coverage for it. Does anyone know if there's any way of getting financial assistance with these kinds of services?

Things were good, and my own life seemed to be finally on track after my own period of darkness.

This all change around a month ago, completely out of the blue. My partner suddenly started to become withdrawn from me and spent all our time together in bed on his phone. A once chatty and affectionate person suddenly cut me out cold. He went from best friend to acquaintance over night. He started doing things that seem so out of character for him, suddenly everything he did was a secret and he began to lie to me about everything (including about texting/hanging around with a women, he denies cheating but he's lied so much I can't be sure of anything anymore).

This all exploded around a week ago when I finally found out he was lying. I gave him an open floor to finally be honest with me to see if we can move past this, and yet he continued to lie to my face (I found photos that totally contradict what he was insisting). Yesterday he finally said that he wasn't sure if his love was the same anymore and he wasn't sure if that's what the cause of his depression is. I suggested he see someone, but he kept insisting he just needed to work out what was making him miserable and remove himself from it.

This all happened so suddenly. I'm feeling so confused and hurt, I feel like I don't know him at all anymore. It's not as simple as me just walking away. I couldn't stay here if we split, it would be the end of my life as I knew it. I'd lose more than just him.

As a background, I was clinically diagnosed with MDD, GAD and a panic disorder now 4 years ago. Definitely has not gotten better over the years and I would even venture to say its gotten worse, however, that's not the point of this post.

Is it normal to find things to obsess about to cope with how I'm feeling? One of the first signs I can remember before my first episode was that I was obsessed with planning to get a pet. I had a binder FULL of costs, supplies, etc. for this pet that I wanted. I spent months going back over every single detail and looking for better stuff and better deals for the items I'd need. I'd research common illnesses and how to deal with them. You get the idea, but I poured my life into it and didn't show a soul. It was a huge secret but it was all my work. 

Now, 4 years later, I see myself doing the same thing but with multiple things depending on the day. One day I'll obsess over one thing, then another the next day. When I obsess and plan, I completely forget about everything. Time really flies. I also never obsess over the things that are bothering me. It's always little, random things. Like a pet. Or reviews and specs on a planner... weird right? But like I said its just weird little things. Nothing worthwhile.

But I'm looking for help as getting it elsewhere is going nowhere and I have no idea how to find it, at this point strangers on the internet are my only option... So here's my predicament. For the past four/five years I've been trying to get to the bottom of issues behind major depression and anxiety, which is seriously stopping me getting anywhere in life and time is wasting away. Only to come into the road block every time of my drug use, despite the problems started way before the drug use. I just didn't confront them with professionals at the time, mostly due to the anxiety of doing so. Now drugs have become the only crutch I have and have had since the issues started. Today was the fourth time I attended a session with a mental health professional and once again have been told sessions can't continue and I'll have to rerefer when not using (for the record the only drug I use daily is cannabis and consider that medicinal, you know with all the evidence behind it helping with depression, GAD and social anxiety which are my main problems. I do use other drugs as well but not enough to have any lasting mental effects). I'm getting worried at this point, stuck, unable to get treatment because of cannabis use and unable to stop cannabis use because I can't get treatment for what's causing most of the use... Its making my drug use worse and its not unlike me to enjoy some of the more hard, dangerous substances which with how I felt for the past few years I'm lucky to not already be addicted to them and have a real drug problem, or worse.

49,"I've been suffering with what i guess is social anxiety since i was 13 and I am 15 now. I've dealt with things on my own, eating disorder, i don't even know what to call this but sometimes i get so sad random weeks that for that week i'll only eat two bowls of cereal and drink water for the whole week. just for the fact that i can't make myself eat even if i want to. 

Anyways, i've been forced to be homeschooled my whole life and i come from a christian family that doesn't believe in mental illness. And says i just need to ""toughen up"" and ""stop being a little bitch"" even though they only know about the anxiety part nobody in my family knows i've dealt with random spurts of an eating disorder, self harmed. you get the picture. 

but since i'm not in school i can't just go to a counselor and ask for a referral to a therapist. So i'm kinda stuck. I would have already made up an illness and made my mom take me to the doctor we go to so i can tell him ""hey doc, anxiety i think i have it "" but he's also christian and believes mental illness is caused by not having a strong enough relationship with God..so you see how that won't work. 

So when i sit down my parents what would i even say ""hey mom and dad my mind is screwed up..mind calling up a therapist"" like i have no idea what to say where to even start. And as soon as i tell them i want help they will start interrogating me about the reasons i need help, then that'll make my mom feel like a failure and i don't want to make her sad (on the regular she tells me and my family how much of a failure she is) and honestly i would rather tell a complete stranger all of my shit than my parents. 

So what i'm asking is, what would you say to explain you need help, if you've been in my position before what did you say that got you the help you needed. Thank you if you do respond i know i probably sound like a whiny teenager. ",23May2017,1,

Some backstory, my brother and I had a rough childhood. Without going into major details, our mom is a narcisstic drug addict and has really had a negative effect on my brother. He has lived with our grandparents since he was 15, he's 23 now.

He's a good kid. He doesn't drink or do drugs. He has a job and goes to school. However, because of our upbringing, he is extraordinarily introverted. He's gotten better over the years, but it used to be so bad he couldnt even order his own food when we would go out to eat. He doesn't really have any friends because it's nearly impossible for him to talk to people. 

He says he hates how awkward he is. He doesn't like himself. He's afraid he will die alone. He got close to a girl he works with, but she just got out of a relationship and said she wasn't ready for a new one. They are still friends, but I think it still hurts him.

So like I said, he lives with our grandparents. My grandmother, who has good intentions usually I think, is also a bit of a naracissit. She recently discovered my brother has been cutting himself. She calls me in a fit, making it all about herself. This is a direct quote from our conversation, ""you need to talk to him, you need to fix this. I cannot have him committing suicide in my house."" Shitty right? I know she cares, but damn woman. 

I love my brother with all my heart. We have been through hell and back together and I've always protected him. I don't know what to do or what to say. We are close, but both of us are pretty closed off. We don't like to talk about our feelings, so it's hard.

I asked him if he wanted to talk about it and he said no. So I just told him I love him, I would do anything for him, and I would be here if he did want to talk. 

That was a few weeks ago. Today my grandma called me and said my brother was still cutting himself. 

He's here now and I don't know what else to say or what to do? I love my brother, I just want to help him. Please, tell me how to help? 

TLDR: my brother is cutting himself, what can I do to help him?",23May2017,3,
53,"So my doctors gave me referrals to see a psychiatrist and I was depressed at the time. Now with the meds I'm feeling great and I'm not sure if I should go....

What are your thoughts?",23May2017,1,
54,"not that anyone cares anyway 
but I wanted to say that I haven't self harmed even though I really really have wanted to in the recent weeks due to juggling so many shit stuff going on.
I don't know if that warrants being proud of myself but I haven't got anyone to say it to.
because of exams I haven't been able to go to my counsellor and have barely been speaking to anyone today. but I guess I wanted to write it somewhere.

not to add that I feel so incredibly guilty feeling depressed when all this awful stuff is happening to close to me. ",23May2017,1,
55,"Lately, I've been feeling off. I have no drive to do anything. I even try to force myself at times, but everything is a struggle. I force myself to go out and be around people but then end up feeling anxious and unusual and want to go home. I try to read books to pass the time, but I struggle to focus on the words I read and forget all the information as soon as I read it. In turn, I just get more frustrated and upset with myself because I feel stupid. I never used to struggle with reading anything. I'm also really lost about who I want to be or what defines me. I have no real interests or hobbies. I just got a new job, but I don't want to go to that job, or any job for that matter. I probably will, but I feel that I'll hate it. I still live with my parents, but I'm stuck between wanting to stay with them and wanting to move out and be my own person. Both come with their own struggles. I literally have no idea what I want, can't keep focus at all and end up spending most days with no objective and get nothing done. I just want to know what's wrong with me so I can work on fixing it. I've tried almost every antidepressant, and now I'm on an anti psychotic because my doctor suggested that I could be bipolar but I just don't know anymore. Nothing seems to be getting better. What should I do? ",23May2017,3,

58,"For a long while it seems I have suffered with extremely intrusive thoughts. These thoughts in one case I feel were the root cause of me losing my job as I wasn't able to take my mind off of certain things when sat at my desk which caused me to work at a slower pace. The process of these thoughts have always been similar, in most cases I will think back to a moment in the past where I may have had an issue with someone or there may have been some kind of problem &amp; perhaps I was made to feel small - in my case these things have popped up and they happened years and years ago. I'm 19 now and most of these things happened at the early stages of secondary/high school. These thoughts will play on my mind for months and months, and in a couple of cases I've had to message the person to reassure myself that everything is okay &amp; that things were left in the past. 

I also feel like I suffer with anxiety now, always find myself feeling extremely nervous &amp; try hard not to make a fool of or embarrass myself which in turn causes me to shy away from doing certain things. I worry a lot about what people think of me and find it hard to accept that someone may not like me for whatever reason. I've found that my hands seem to shake slightly a lot of the time and I'm unable to control it. Not sure if this is linked but felt it might be worth mentioning. 

I've spoken to my Mum a few times about this and she says that we are basically the same person and she's experienced similar things in the past, she always feels like she's in the wrong about something and someone may have a problem with her when really there is literally nothing to worry about. 

Should also mention I experienced the loss of my Nan last year and it's still not quite sunk in as we were very close. This has been a big struggle for myself and my family so perhaps this links with it also.

59,"This may be a long post but I will try to make it as brief as possible.  I am desperate for help and really have no idea where to turn.  Some background first then the current issue.

Background:  If it's any help, I am only a year older... our lives were virtually as identical as possible so I have always questioned what her issues are.
My sister has always been a really hard person to live with.  She is your classic ""Drama Queen"".  When things don't go her way she becomes suicidal or suffers a 'severe anxiety attack' or cuts herself.  She uses these things to manipulate those around her into always doing what she wants.  As a young child she would pee in her pants if in public places when my mom wouldn't do what she wanted and create a big scene and mess so that my mom wouldn't say no to her.  She would throw tantrums that made people think my parents were abusing her if my mom would say no to her in a shopping store.  On most family vacations she would literally scream for days when things didn't go her way.  On a Disneyworld trip my parents decided we would go counter clockwise through the park and the ride she wanted was a few in going clockwise through the park.  She screamed at the top of her lungs, bloody murder to the point that more than one park official asked if everything was ok for the entire day.  These were all her childhood behaviors.

In high school my sister started acting out differently.  She became sexually active, slept around, and dressed inappropriately.  She was often inappropriately loud if anyone questioned her behavior she would scream out that we were essentially persecuting her.  Sometime around Sophmore year we had a class that talked about mental illness and stuff and this is when my sister decided that she had a mental illness.  I say decided because it happened over night.  She started dressing all in black, cutting herself, refusing to eat (though she would eat when we weren't home but pretend like she wasn't eating).  She claimed she was depressed.  My parents took her to see someone and they would drop her off at her appointments and then pick her up.  Eventually my parents got called in and started being questioned and we came to find out that she was claiming things like they abused her (absolutely never happened), refused to feed her (always had lots and lots of food in the house and we could eat it whenever we wanted... my dad was especially of the mind that we could always have as much fruits and veggies as we wanted), kept her a prisoner (we literally both each had a car, we could come and go as long as we told our parents what we were doing.  They rarely if ever said no as long as homework was done).  Essentially a string of lies.  When my parents were called in and accused of these things it was like being blindsided.  I was brought into the discussion and they were investigated and obviously there was nothing found.  We were then advised to not play into my sister's 'attention seeking behavior'.

For the next many years in early adulthood she would try to pull these big schemes and we wouldn't play into them.  When she did have real problems we of course would go help her.  But we always made sure that she either got help for them or we were walking away.  For the first time since her being born she was someone that wasn't impossible to be around.  You could have conversations.  She understood the boundaries.  This was a stable way of life for her for about 10 years.

So current problem:
She met and married a man a few years ago that feed her need for attention and she's back to being worse than she ever was as a kid.  She complains about having depression to them, is back to telling stories to them about how evil my parents are, creating these complex dramas where we are forbidden from talking to her for months on end because of how horrible we are.  We have tried to talk to her husband's family and let them know about her past and how she lies but to them we are being the horrible people that she is claiming we are.  Every time she wants attention she writes some facebook post taking pictures of her self-harm saying she's so suicidal and they all jump to 'give her hugs' while we suggest ""if this is real, take her to the hospital""... She was pregnant about a year ago and during her pregnancy she didn't pull any stunts.  We suspect it's because she got plenty of attention with her pregnancy and for a while after the child was born she was happy but then I got pregnant and since I've been pregnant she has suddenly developed post-partum depression now and suddenly refuses to see her kid at all.  We of course took this seriously and demanded she get help but when we did that she changed her diagnosis to 'anxiety disorder' and has 'panic attacks' all the time and claims she cannot take care of her kid.  I have seen one of her panic attacks... i have worked as a counselor myself in a mental health institution ... she is not having a panic attack.  Again, our response was ""ok we will come take you to a hospital and get you help""... but she doesn't want that.  

So now we are in this situation where she has moved her kid out of their home (to the other grandparents) and is claiming to suffer all these issues and banning us from communicating with her.  I watch her poor kid being shuffled around like some kenneled dog ... she has no connection to him.  It hurts me to see.  We try to talk to the other family but they think we are just cold hearted abusive people because of what she has told them and they just keep feeding her delusions.  Normally I would just let her self-destruct but now there is a poor innocent child involved and I literally ache for him.  When my sister was still living at home in high school and we all talked to the therapist as a family she suggested my sister might have Histronic Personality Disorder but since she was in high school they were reluctant to diagnose it.  How can we help her 'new family' understand this when everything we would say to demonstrate this feeds into us just being horrible people who don't care?  She is very smart, she reads up on the disorders that she claims to have and she is very 'flavor of the month' about them.  I am not saying she doesn't have some problems, but she never wants to get help for them.  She thrives on the attention she gets from them and it only makes her worse.  We were able to control these behaviors for a decade by being supportive in a way that said we will help you by taking you to a doctor... her 'new family' glorifies mental illness and tells her how amazing she is to suffer so much and don't try to get her help for these issues she is claiming to have.

Please help.  How can we rectify this situation for the sake of the innocent child involved.  He deserves a stable life where his parents focus on his needs and his mother doesn't get jealous of the attention that he is getting.

Please... I don't know what to do and it's killing me to watch this play out.

I will answer any questions if it helps at all.",23May2017,3,
60,"…I turn the lights out and go to bed. Then I feel empty like there is a black cloud of sadness comes over me. 

I first had depression a few years back. It was partially caused by the work and social environment I was in. I removed myself from it and gradually stop taking my prescribed medication by choice. 

Shortly after I turned 30, it has returned. I feel this bout is worse than last time. Now I get anxious about social events and even when good things has happened to me, there a part of me that still feels sad. 

Although I have good days and bad days, a part of me is unsure if I'll ever get better properly. ",23May2017,3,
