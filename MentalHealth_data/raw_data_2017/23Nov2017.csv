0,"In 2015 I was in hospital for 5 months. I was feeling suicidal for a while and was put into hospital in February because I was scared that people were trying to kill me so I thought I should kill myself before they did luckily I didn't act on my thoughts but I did use a knife on myself but didn't harm myself badly 


next I was taken away in a police van and taken to leverndale hospital oddly I wasn't scared on the journey there but was once I reached the hospital I was upset and anxious because I was in a new place 

I was in the newer part of the hospital which was nice but the people there were very odd.

I started wanting to escape so I tried to run away at every chance.

Once I managed to run away by going through the fire exit setting off every alarm in the hospital.

I thought to myself ""I just want to die "" so I ran towards the main , very busy road and ran infront of three fast traveling  cars.... 

Luckily all the cars stopped in time and I was upset that I didn't get hit I then got picked up by a police car and taken back to the hospital

Around 3 weeks later I was moved to a different ward with nicer people and they helped me recover and was eventually released from hospital in July.

I have been out of hospital for 2 years and 4 months 

I am now at college studying and I'm happy with the way my life is going 

Thanks for reading stay blessed ☺️❤️",23Nov2017,29
1,I have done telemedicine twice with my psychiatrist and I hate it! I've never actually met him in person and I can't take him seriously. He can never fit me into his actual schedule and yet he can facetime me. It's not like I can just do it from the comfort of my own home either. I have to physically go to his office and sit in front of a computer screen while he's at home and I can stop laughing at it. ,23Nov2017,2

3,"I'm writing a story and looking for perspective from real life experiences. I'll be using symbolism to discuss mental illness and I want to be as accurate as possible.

5,"I am a student journalist who did a story in June about an 8-year-old boy in the community I grew up in. He had a rare adult brain cancer and his parents' insurance couldn't cover the costs to send him to an experimental treatment abroad. They sold everything to get him help, and the entire community chipped in. The first treatment alone shrunk his tumor by 50%.

The story I wrote was front page in our city's (not town's) newspaper. It was immediately picked up by the Associated Press. I gave a few lectures at my university on the experience, and why it is important to practice empathy as a journalist. I texted the boy's mother once a week to check on him. I became very close to the family. I went to one of his baseball games, and they often called me to catch up.

Then I got a call Friday that the boy had suddenly died. Within a matter of hours. I was overwhelmed with a very dark emotion. I've had family members die before, but this was 100x worse of a feeling. I stayed in bed for two days until it was his funeral. I felt like I should just tell his mom how sorry I was, so I went alone.

It was... awful. It was an open casket. Seeing an 8-year-old I had talked to just five months ago about Star Wars and his new dog actually lifeless was... terrible. I wanted to pass out. He was so young. Then his mom saw me and started sobbing. She held me for over a minute in the middle of the church, and I just hugged her back.

I saw his 10-year-old brother go up to the casket with a lollipop in his mouth. His school friends crying in the funeral home. But seeing him ACTUALLY DEAD made me shake.

I haven't stopped feeling dark for several days. I came home from school for Thanksgiving and my mom pulled me aside. She doesn't believe in depression or speaking to professionals (she's a hippie anti-vaxer who thinks that mental health can be cured by exercise). But she told me straight up that something is seriously wrong with me, and she's worried. I guess I'm not even sounding like myself. All I keep seeing is that dead little kid and how my writing wasn't enough to help him.

I cannot get out of this funk and now my parents are annoyed because they said the funeral should have been closure. But it made the feelings so much worse. Should I talk to someone? My school has a free counseling program. I'm just worried I'll say something that will make them tell my parents, which is so dumb (I'm 21).

I just need some guidance. ",23Nov2017,4
6,"I'd like to start off by saying that I'm not bipolar but my psychiatrist prescribed me Lamictal because I have depersonalization disorder and mood stabilizers are the only class of drugs I haven't tried yet. I tried several antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzos, other medicines, none of them helped the dissociative feelings. Anyway, about once a week I drank quite a bit while on both antidepressants and antipsychotics (I'm talking anywhere from 6-12 alcoholic beverages) and never had any issues. Never felt ill or anything.. As of now the only medication I'm taking is Lamictal. So would it be safe to drink on Lamictal? I plan on keeping drinking to a minimum right now but I want to make sure next time I do drink alcohol im not going to die just from drinking beer while taking lamictal..",23Nov2017,3
7,"3 medications so far have been pretty average in my mental health treatment over 16 months. Was diagnosed with depression but i am noticing that I will often be happy, have a mini emotional breakdown where my mood drops and i am suicidal, and in the same day I will snap out of it and be back to my 'happy, cheery' self. 

I was reading an article on Bipolar II and Rapid Switching that said antidepressants like Prozac are often quite ineffective in Rapid Switching and that a mood stabiliser or antipsychotic/anticonvulsant is better. Any advice would be helpful. I am looking for a bulk billing psychiatrist to help me out as well. Thanks!",23Nov2017,3
8,"I'm a 25yo female with diagnoses of MDD &amp; PTSD. 

I saw my psychiatrist yesterday for a medication review as I felt as though my Pristiq 150mg was becoming less and less effective. 

Given the side-effects I experienced with Pristiq, I have been prescribed a starting dose of 150mg of Zyban, with room to move upto 300mg if needed.
 I'll be starting the Zyban in 3 weeks, once I titrate my Pristiq. 

My psychiatrist did a naughty and got me a 3 month supply on the PBS (by saying that it is for smoking-cessation). 
However, it's very likely I will need to pay full price ($160) after this 3 month period. 

Calling all Aussies who take Zyban - do you use private health insurance to subsidise the full price of a Zyban prescription? 

Calling anyone who takes Zyban/Wellbutrin - what side-effects have you experienced? 
I suffered from extreme night sweats &amp; terrible sexual dysfunction on Pristiq (and previously Fluoxetine). 
I'm looking forward to the *decreased* risk of sexual dysfunction on Zyban, as all as the possibility of weight loss. ",23Nov2017,0
9,"So my mom slept for a long time today. She woke up around 2pm and then went back to sleep. I woke her up again at around 5pm and asked her if she was going to make dinner. She said she would make a pizza. Around 6:30 she put a pizza in the oven. When it was finished she took it out and cut it (very sloppely might i add, like she was tired). But she didnt call me out of my room to tell me it was done. So about 10 minutes later i come out to see the pizza on top of the oven. I find my mom sleeping on the living room chair. I go over to her and tell her the pizza is getting cold and ask her why she didnt come and tell me it was ready. She says ""im waiting for the pizza to get done"". I tell her that it is done and she already made it. She said she was sorry and that she was tired. I said that she was scaring me and asked if she was ok and she said ""dont be scared im fine"". I said that she needed to get some sleep so she went back to bed. 10 minutes later i find her in the kitchen opening the oven. I ask her what she is doing and she says ""im checking on the pizza"". I tell her that she already made it and that i ate some and the rest is in the fridge. I say that she is scaring me and she says that she is sorry and she is just tired. Then she goes back to bed. She has been in bed since around 7. Its 10:20 now. Im so scared. I asked my friends and they say it sounds like dementia. Should i be worried?",23Nov2017,2

11,"Hello, I'm at this point where I would wanna try antidepressants for my depression.
I've tried different things over years that ultimately didn't help and recently it's very bad so this is something I've considered for a long time.
3 therapists in and no one even broached the topic to me (why? Do I not seem off bad enough? Bc for me it's pretty bad!) .
So I wanna ask my current one if this would be a treatment option.

He's the expert though so it seems odd for me as the patient to be presenting him the treatment, I don't wanna come off sounding desperate for meds or smth idk.
I'm just nervous about this. I'm afraid he'll tell me I'm looking for outside influences trying to fix me when the healing has to come from within myself.

So how do I best do this? Without sounding desperate or like I'm pretending to be a doctor after reading up on them on Google for a few hours lol.
I added my locations, Germany, in the odds someone from here saw this post and could share their experiences.

14,"I was diagnosed with general anxiety when I was 5, and social anxiety when I was 11. I was very recently also diagnosed with OCD, ADHD, and bipolar disorder. I can't take any medication for it, and I don't have time or money for therapy at the moment. I'm doing really badly in my classes, mostly because of the anxiety and ADHD. Unfortunately, my school doesn't have any resources for ADHD and doesn't recognize it as a mental illness.

So I just wanted to know your experiences with mental illness and university (or college, or whatever other school). How did it affect your education, and was the school any help?",23Nov2017,2
18,"Doing this on mobile, hopefully its formatted ok.


Hello, I'm a 29 year old man with a long history of a anxiety and some depression. Quick backstory: I've never been comfortable around people. As a kid I always kept to myself. My parents got divorced when I was 5 and I always thought it was my fault. We moved a lot when I was a kid. 3 schools in 1 year is my personal record. In college I'd had classes where I could literally go the entire semester without saying a word. I keep my hair buzzed really short because I hate getting haircuts due to the forced small talk. I got a dog in my last year of school, and he's really helped the depression. I've only got a couple friends that I barely see since I moved 1.5 hours away for work. Ive been single since college. Worked with a girl was I was really into back in school, but she was happy with her BF so nothing ever happened. She set me up with one of her friends, not a great relationship in hindsight. I graduated, moved, been single ever since. The last couple years have been great because of a videogame called Destiny. Joined a clan (group of people that play together regularly) and would hang out with these guys online most nights. The sequel came out in September though, its just bad and nobody plays and the clan is just gone now. So I'm back to being bored and depressed and alone.


I've been taking adderall since I was around 20. 20 mg, so a pretty small dose. It helps me focus, and has the great side effect of helping me be slightly more social. Not confident enough to start up a conversation with strangers, more like no worries about having an anxiety attack in the checkout line at the grocery store because someone is about to ask me if I found everything alright.


My biggest worry about trying to get help for the depression and anxiety is that I'll lose the adderall prescription. I'm an analytical chemist, and I love my job but half my day is data entry. Without adderall I'm fucked. I tried to stop taking it when I got out of college, I cannot do my job without it. Work is the highlight of my day, and i dont want to change jobs.


What should I do? I'm too scared to even bring up the depression and anxiety with my doctor because I'm worried they'll switch me to different meds (I have to see him every 6 months to renew the Adderall prescription). I've never taken meds for anxiety or depression, from what I've heard there are a lot of people that don't think the medication helps them, but I'm very uninformed on the subject honestly. Would therapy be worth a shot? 



Sorry if I'm rambling a bit. Thanks for reading this, any advice would be appreciated.

20,"TW for graphic descriptions and the like. It's 4am and I feel brain fried so I don't really pretty it up

My cocktail of illnesses are getting worse again I think. Well worse is subjective since I've been like this my whole life.

It's gotten to the point where every moment left alone my intrusive thoughts and homicidal urges get worse. Everything causes them to flare and it's at the point where even when I'm calm and relaxed everything I look at just fills my head with thoughts on how I could kill with it. It used too only fill my head to the point of exhaustion when someone annoyed me but now those thoughts combined with intrusive sexual ones are 24/7, and when I'm alone unchecked I even get ones and autocannibalism ones (like constant intense urges to cut stomach open so I can prepae my guts, the thoughts seem to focus on the intestines and I hate how pleasurable they make it sound) so bad that I can't sleep most nights. My hallucinations keep happening to to the point where I'm buying wrong items while grocery shopping again. My depersonalisation/dissociative amnesia are getting bad again too. I though it'd stop getting worse but it isn't.

 I know this is sort of normal and minor minus the hallucinations but I'm just so so tired it feels like my brain just wont ever turn off. I just want a minute of peace and quiet and to just relax.

I've never been on medication, I last when to a therapist when underage and they refuses to even diagnose me officially because I ""didn't deserve the stigma"".

21,"I’m sorry to waste anyone’s time and I don’t really want to go into much detail right now but I just want to talk about it in someway. I don’t know what I have and I don’t know who to even begin to talk to this about. This is just one thing they I experience that I don’t know how to describe.

It’s like something is ""there"". Like somethings is in the shadows, underneath my bed, in the corner, at the end of a hallway or in a doorway, or even just behind me. I hate this feeling so much, I don’t know how long this things we existed or what it is. For the past two days I have been going pretty good at dealing with it but just then it got so much worse.

I don’t really watch anything horror related but I’ll try and give an example of it. You know when you are watching a show or playing a game and you know something is there or you feel it about to strike or something like that. Well that’s how I feel a lot and tonight’s it’s been worse.

As if this feeling isn’t bad enough, it’s often accompanied with what I could only describe as depersonalisation, but not as a ""nice"" feeling as some people say. For me it’s terrible, I can’t deal with reality and when the depersonalisation gets bad, sometimes I honestly don’t want to be here, I don’t want to you know really be anywhere.

Again, I'm sorry to waste your time. I just wanted to talk about this one thing to someone",23Nov2017,5

28,"Upon waking for breakfast on Thanksgiving, I found that my sister had been taken to the ER. Supposedly, she had stolen a bottle of Xanax and downed the whole thing the previous night, planning on not waking up today. She confessed to this after my dad noticed she was more ""tired and groggy"" than usual and sat her down to talk about it.

This is the 12th time (give or take a few) my sister has been in the hospital for attempting suicide. For me, it's just annoying and a huge inconvenience at this point. I'm so sick of it. I'm sick of my dad complaining about how all his kids (including me) are fucked up. I'm sick of my gold-digging stepmom complaining about how hard me and my sisters are on my dad. I'm sick of being treated like I'm going to relapse into a suicidal depression whenever all this happens. I am so sick and tired of all this. I don't like coming home from college to stay at my dad's house to begin with, and then this shit happens. And this had to happen on Thanksgiving, of all days. Now, everyone at dinner is going to be all awkward, emotional, and anxious and I'm just going to want to eat my damn turkey so I can go the fuck back to my own apartment and leave behind that godforsaken house and all it's problems.

 So, it got me thinking, if this were my daughter, what would I be able to do to help her? I know it's a super generic question, but it's blatantly obvious my sister cannot function outside of residential in-patient care, so I was wondering if there is an even more long-term (possibly even permanent) care option for someone like my sister. What do you guys think? Feel free to ask questions if needed.

I struggle an awful lot with commitment, I just barely finished 2 years college because of it. I just can't help but start thinking how shit this is and then I want to start misbehaving. I will think about trying to steal something from work, just anything for a quick buzz. I get so bored so easily.

I have never been good at maintaining friendships. Most people I have made friends with have been kind off trouble causers themselves, as much as I like hanging with trouble causers I avoid them because It's not a path I want to go down.

I struggle a lot with actually feeling empathy, I can use cognitive empathy. I am currently undergoing therapy and it's helping, I feel happier in general. I'm able to enjoy my hobbies a lot more than previously but I still seem to have a need to do things I should not be doing. It's completely holding me back.

I struggle with self acceptance although my therapist has given me a method to help change that. I had to shift the sessions to monthly due to financial reasons, so we have not really had chance to touch on why I enjoy getting in trouble.
