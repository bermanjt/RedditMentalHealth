Help I need advice from people that has gone through similar experiences because I need to get out of this. I am very young and I see my life is passing with this illness that makes everything exponentially worse.

I am going through a very difficult phase in my illness. Right now the illness has reached levels I couldn't never have imagined. I see and hear things that are not there. I suffer from Persecutory Delusions and my life is ruined and I am not getting better.  

Three years ago I went to six countries and nine cities during a 20 day trip, a year later I did another trip to eight cities in 20 days.  Today that seems like an impossible thing to do for me. I cannot longer be okay on hotels or traveling because of fears that are unreal. 

Also, I lived alone for more than 5 years and today I cannot sleep alone because of unreal fears. I have constant nightmares and bad dreams. And fears that are always about the same topic. I suffer from Persecutory Delusions and I fear everybody is against me, also with fears, extreme fears, about being robbed. 


Please help!",27Dec2017,1,

2,"Hello. I'm an 18 year old male. I'm not in life threatening condition. I'm sure my issue is extremely petty and I'm so so sorry to complain about something so small. 

To explain, I don't have many friends. I go to a school where I don't fit in with my classmates. I didn't realize everyone didn't feel this way until my junior (last) year. I'm a senior now, and have always been in honors classes and the other kids in those classes are usually from much higher-income neighborhood, meaning they have been friends with each other for years and are...different? They're not worse, but they are are always happy, active in a bunch of clubs, dress  very nice etc. I've never really tried, or been offered to join their friend groups but I cannot say I haven't wanted to.I want to feel included. I  I've always had a few people I consider ""friends"" in my classes, but I rarely (maybe once every couple months?) hang out with someone outside of school, and this year that fact has hit my very hard. I don't know what to do to change, and I also don't know why I care so much. I'm not friends with them at school because I dislike most guys in my grade, (nothing whiteknight-y, just have different interests. They all care about sports, where I haven't watched sports in years and don't wish to. I'm a gamer, and don't know anyone else at my school who plays my game) so a majority of my school-friends are girls. Well it's much more intimidating to hang out with girls than guys but I don't really care about that. I just want to know why I feel so goddamn lonely and inferior to everyone else at my school. Why (even though I know it doesn't matter) do I wish I had more friends and was out of my house and off of this website. Typing this much now I want to delete it all but I won't. Recently I've made a couple of friends that I have gone out to eat with, both of them girls and one that I've had a crush on previously (and she knows that I did). When I'm not with them I just feel so fucked up because it's so nice to be included with people and to be apart of people's lives but when I'm not with them I mentally freak out and just feel like utter shit. Obviously not 24/7, but often at night when I'm extra lonely and shit. I suppose this turned into more of a vent than a request. I don't even know what my problem is. 

My parents have very passive/defensive personalities and I've noticed this inside of myself growing up, that I default to reject new experiences and I see it more clearly every day that I got this from my parents. Needless to say we haven't grown up close, parents are both very type A and I am very B. I'm a laid-back carefree guy but inside my head all I do is worry and complain and I hate it. How do I break this curse and not worry about every damn thing (another trait passed-down) about my social life and focus on what's important. I go to college in August and I don't know why that thought doesn't put me at ease to stop caring about what happens here. I just feel so goddamn alone.

Maybe I'm just in love with that girl and that's why I'm all fucked up. I really goddamn hope not.

4,"I knew something was really wrong when my best friend told me this morning that something happened and she needed to call me - she lives in a different state, if one of us isn't visiting then we exclusively talk over messenger.

Apparently she got home from christmas vacation with her family to find her roommate had hung herself. Luckily she has family somewhat in the area that was able to pick her up and she's staying with them right now. She's got depression and anxiety already, having talked with her plenty about it in the past I can tell that she's somewhat in shock and not really able to process things right now - which is extremely understandable. She'll be seeking out grief counseling and has additional time off of work so she doesn't need to worry about life stuff for a while which is extremely good. She did express that she wanted to let me know that she might not be around/responsive much for a bit, and that theres not many people she'd talk to about this and thanked me for that.

I was somewhat in shock at the time, I think I did an okay-ish job at the time of being supportive, letting her know that I'm here anytime she wants to talk, acknowledging the shittiness of the situation without dwelling on it, etc - but at this point, I don't know what to do. I'm somewhat of a fixer by nature, which I realize is not something I can do at this point and I'm pretty good at suppressing that when I need to. But she's still my best friend, this is objectively a horrible situation for her, and I want to be sure I'm doing right by her and supporting her in any way I can.

Should I follow up in messenger at some point later today reminding her that I care and she can call me anytime? There's a part of me that wants to offer flying out there (which is something I actually could do), it's not anything she'd ever ask me to do outright. But I feel like that might put too much pressure on her if I were to bring it up. I guess I don't know how best to balance giving her space and time to deal with things on her own terms, with not just going completely radio silent indefinitely. And really don't know what I'm doing at this point. I just feel extremely bad for her and want to help in whatever way I can.

I don't know what to do. For myself, I've already talked to my mother (she's a trauma counselor!) and I've got a therapist appointment coming up in a couple days, so I'm not terribly worried about myself/my ability to work through my secondhand exposure to this - more concerned about my friend at this point.

5,I have a mild stomach bug rn and I keep crying because I hate how depressed I am that I’m sick. I’m missing work and I feel so useless. I can’t sleep cause my mind keeps running.  How can I stay positive? ,27Dec2017,3,
6,"Using a throw away and I’m on the mobile app— so I sincerely apologize in advance if I’m doing something wrong.  (I am in the USA if it matters). 

Not sure how to begin, but here goes anyway. 

About 20 years ago, my mom entered menopause and severely went off the deep end. My folks were getting divorced, her mom had just died, and after years of minor paranoia she just flipped. She was convinced people were breaking into the house and car; talking about her on radio, tv shows and in public places; replacing important documents with forged ones; and basically trying to “gaslight” her (although her accusations made no sense). All the while she was getting Increasingly more physically and mentally abusive with my sibling and I until it reached a point where it was detrimental to stay. My sibling and I finally left the house to stay with friends’ family down the road.  My mom just left town at that point. Eventually, she was committed to a mental hospital after threatening her lawyer, and fought and beat cancer (my sibling and I visited her one time in the hospital), and was released back to the world. Mental health wise, she was at one point diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, but she claims she had that changed to severe depression and ptsd. 

She made contact with me again years later after showing up at my work and I decided to continue a relationship with her. My sibling is no contact. Both my sibling and I are now in our 30s, married, with children. I live in a different state than they do, a few hours away by car. 

Mom has a pattern. Get a job, complain about how she’s the only one doing any work and start fights with coworkers, tick everyone off there, get laid off, start getting paranoid again; lather rinse repeat. This cycle has been going on for years. Usually it resolves itself when she gets a job. I have no proof but I think when she gets laid off she starts cutting her medication in half to save money (and/or she’s just stressed and sitting there thinking too hard about stuff and comes up with outlandish theories). 

This time is probably the worst I’ve seen her since I was still living with her. Recently, my mom got into a dispute with her neighbor, and then got laid off from her job. In the recent past, she’s gone through changing all her locks on her house and car, buying a new cell phone because someone “hacked” hers, or repeatedly reformatting her computer when in her paranoid phase, but this time it’s so much worse. 

Long story short Mom is calling me now every day with new things that have been disturbed in her house (random things in her house getting switched out or stolen, etc). 

There’s more, so so much more but no one has time to read that War &amp; Peace length book.

8,"I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder at a young age. I’m in my first year of uni now, and have also been secretly coping with depression for a while. About 2 months ago I started self-harming, and thus begun a general downward spiral, culminating with me not studying nearly enough as I felt I should, and failing one or two exams thanks to preexisting but much worsened test anxiety. My family and my doctor know about the anxiety, but not the depression/self-harm, and my doctor prescribed me Prozac (for the anxiety) saying that I had to find a counsellor to track my progress in the new semester.

I’ve kept my depression secret because I haven’t wanted to burden my family with it, but I do realize that while I *might* be able to keep pretending, it would probably kill me in the process. When I was told I had to get a counsellor I was worried at first because it would mean that eventually the secret would be out, but the more I think about it the more I realize that it’s a chance to at least try to ‘fix’ myself before I snap entirely. At least when everybody does learn that I’m depressed I’d be on the mend (hopefully) and it would be an issue gradually receding into the past. And so I’m sitting here with the forms and everything from Student Health Services, and wondering what exactly this will mean when I finally get an appointment in January or February.

I’ll be starting the appointments to treat the anxiety (my only ‘official’ mental illness besides ADHD), but I don’t expect it to take long for them to realize there’s more at play than just anxiety. For those of you who have gone through this, what can I expect from the appointments? I know the first appointment won’t solve any problems, but I’m still curious about how it goes, starting out or long term. Is there a risk I’ll be institutionalized or held for observation? What are the protocols with confidentiality? Are they usually nice? Did it help?

Sorry for this ramble of a post, but I’d really appreciate any advice or knowledge you think would be helpful - I'm sure even an anecdotal story couldn’t hurt! I know counselling can’t solve everything, but I’m really looking to it as a kind of last rope to try to climb before I just start trying to tie loops instead. I realize I could probably find answers to these questions on the internet at large, but I’ve come to trust the advice people give on this sub so I thought I’d try here first. Thanks!",27Dec2017,1,

Have you ever heard of the ""pink elephant"" game? Where someone will say ""Don't think of the pink elephant"" and then of course, you will naturally think of a pink colored elephant immediately, because it's the brain's tendency to do so?

So my question is how to deal with intrusive thoughts that won't leave. Does meditation help with this? I've been considering trying it out, but I don't know if I want to commit to it if it can't help with my problem.",27Dec2017,3,
10,"Hey, this a throwaway account. I just need advice and I can't really ask anybody in real life. If you guys could offer your two cents, I'd be really appreciative. 

Long story short, I've had a lot of changes lately, and I'm about to have a lot more. I got engaged to somebody in the military, I'm about to graduate college, and I just got done with both finals week and probably the busiest semester of my life. I know I should feel relieved and joyful, and I definitely do, but it's punctuated with moments of terror and self-loathing and despair. I've broken down into tears for no reason while doing extremely mundane tasks - just the act of eating dinner made me cry the other day - and I keep overreacting with panic to things nobody else is really stressed about (scheduling when somebody is supposed to be coming over, for example.) When I was at school, thinking about being home or seeing my family was enough to make me start crying; I thought being home would help, but it hasn't. Nobody knows this is going on with me, as I don't let myself got overly emotional around others. If I'm being honest, the self-loathing has gotten to concerning levels. There were a few days and nights where I couldn't stop thinking about how much better the lives of the people around me would be if I wasn't around anymore. I feel better now, and I wasn't in any danger of doing anything about it, but I don't know if that was just hormones, or bad coping skills, or something more serious. I was diagnosed with chemical depression in middle school (a side effect of medication I had been taking since elementary school) and went off antidepressants right before coming to college, and some of what I'm feeling is familiar and some of it is new. 

 I just can't tell if what's going on is normal. I don't know if I'm just being overdramatic, or if I have really terrible coping skills from depression when I was younger, or if it's just hormones, or if it's something that's actually abnormal that somebody can help me with. If it's hormones, I don't know why it would last for weeks. If it's bad coping skills or being overdramatic, I don't know how to fix it. My university offers free or low-cost counseling services, but I don't know if what's going on is serious enough to see somebody about or if I should just wait it out. I feel like I can't let anybody know how broken I feel right now, especially since I don't have a good reason to feel this way. I don't have a good, concrete thing to talk about with the counselor beyond ""I feel really bad and I don't know why."" Episodes like this have come and gone in the past, but maybe it's something I need to get checked out, especially since I'm about to be marrying someone and this might become their problem, too. So I'm coming to you, Internet. Let me know what you think. 

TL;DR: I've had extreme emotional reactions to things over the past few weeks, including concerning bouts of self-loathing. I can't tell if it's actually a problem I should see somebody about or if it's something I should just wait out. Seeing somebody would be low-cost or free, but I don't know how effective it would be since I can't pin down a specific problem. I might just be wasting everybody's time. What do you think?

11,"Okay, only a small fraction of people do actually belittle me.

I don't want to sound arrogant but I am really sick of some people telling me I'm smart and some people telling me I'm an idiot. That stupid job I went to... they told me I had all the skills they were looking for, the technical skills, and the social skills, and they chose me over the other candidates who I felt were much smarter. I get mixed messages and it's driving me insane. I wonder sometimes if I'm really good at fooling people. Have I fooled teachers? Have I fooled class mates?... or are they all fooling me, playing dumb. I don't even know anymore. 

Why can't I just be respected and blend in. I'm not asking to stick out... but it seems inevitably if I open my mouth and try to talk to people I think I can connect with..these smart assholes who put me down.  Okay, that's not true of all the smart people I know. The really really smart guys that I met (like in my first university) there was a guy doing physics with me, and he was actually really cool.  He was a really nice guy.  Never did I ever feel like he was treating me in a condescending way.  But sometimes man..these arrogant guys...instead of punching the asshole in the face, I just get defensive and let it go when I really want to fight back.

Oh yeah...the nanny is still here. I'm in the basement..I just pummeled my face a few times because I always attract people like that (okay, not always..rare, but I hate it when I come across them)...she didn't see me, but I think she heard me...

15,"I don't know what it is, I keep trying to do research online of what it could be but I just have no idea. I wanted to get an ""evaluation"" done but 

1. My parents think that if anything does come up its like you are on this permanent blacklist type of thing and you are forever marked, and 
2. I don't even know how I'd go about such a thing.

I just go about most days and I legitimately feel like some alien martian, its like I don't fit in with anyone. There is only 1 person in the world who I can say I relate to on a VERY deep level. Eminem.

Half of me is like ""Everyone is different and has different personalities, you're unique just like everyone else. There is nothing weird about you."" but the other half of me is like ""There MUST be something wrong, I can't imagine ANYONE having these feelings.""

I used to do LSD a while back, I've had about 10 trips. The only way I can explain my life is an acid trip.

I constantly question my life with these unanswerable almost conspiracy questions. Its like ""Am I unlikeable, or is everyone unsociable"".... ""Do my friends not like me, or am I just too needy and my perception is skewed ""... ""Am I normal in my weirdness, or am I just weird...""

I also appear to go through mood swings, and the reason I say appear is, its like it has an on off switch. I can go through a period of time long enough to where I convince myself that I don't have mood swings, but then another period hits where its like extreme euphoria to extreme depression in a matter of a day. I go from convinced I'm normal to convinced I have bipolar disorder. Like right now I'm convinced in normal but I recall about a month ago I was having a good day just walking through campus and then all of a sudden I just started playing sad songs and crying like a little bitch walking around for like an hour.

Top it all off I believe I MIGHT have borderline personality disorder, and I say this because .

1. Borderline Personality Disorder says you have trouble with relationships. Now here are those dilemma questions again because I often feel like my friends don't like me but I don't know if that's just in my head. I often feel like I can't get a girlfriend because I have something wrong with me, but I chalk that up to confidence issues. I have a SHIT relationship with my parents, but is that because I'm fucked in the head or because I find them to be incredibly annoying. Its like I just can't tell.

2. Mood swings are a symptom of BPD. I just want to elaborate a little more on how mine work. I right now would not hurt a fly, I'd probably feel absolute horrible about it. But about a week ago I could 100% murder someone who looked at me wrong and not feel a thing about it.

3. I'm often scared of or feeling lonely, empty, wanting people to be around me.  (But again the dilemma, I feel this might just be an extroverted personality).

4. I had a period in my life where I was MAD reckless and impulsive. I probably smoked my brain cells silly with copious amounts of marijuana, shrooms and LSD. (I've been sober for months now and I'm happy though, I feel like I'm recovering and leading more towards a normal life then the fucked up teen I was).

Anyway, I don't know. Thank you for listening to my little vent about my life and what I face. I feel like life is just a giant adventure I'm lost in. But at the end of the day despite all the craziness I actually really enjoy it. 

I know at the end of the day, all these fucked up questions I have and fucked up feelings I have will just make me a more interesting person. Unless I end up being a serial killer. I don't know.

To sum up this whole story in a TLDR; I'll quote a quote that PERFECTLY describes how I feel by one of my inspirations in life. The only person I feel like I can relate to 100,000%.

16,"This is my very first post on Reddit (please be kind) and it's been long overdue. 

I've reached my limit on how lonely and isolated I feel from the world - and I suppose I'm posting this in order to find some kind of comfort from people who can relate or provide me advice on how to cope. I'm a 21 year old, decently attractive female who recently transferred as a junior to a California State University. Considering I'm a transfer student, the university is located 4 hours from my hometown where I know absolutely no one. I have 3 other roommates who are all friendly, but have their own independent lives/significant others and seem uninterested in making any new friends. Along with this, everyone I've met in my classes have been very nice, the problem is that I'm rather shy, introverted, and don't seem to closely connect with many people due to my unique interests and reserved personality. I suffer from moderate to severe social anxiety, and off and on moderate depression (which seems to flare up and be especially bad during the winter/holiday season). There are plenty of parties and bars to go to to meet people on weekends, but I don't think (mentally) I could work up the courage to go alone. 

There are times I'm fairly content with how independent and solitary my life has been up until this point, although other times, the realization of how alone I am and how I'm the only one out of my friend group back home who is single, starts to sink in and make me feel particularly terrible. I've been in a few long-term relationships and would enjoy having a significant other, but my inability to be outgoing renders any opportunities of finding someone I might be compatible with. I'm social once I get comfortable, above-average smart, have a pretty good sense of humor, and am at least an 8/10 in regards to physical attractiveness I would say; yet I am still left feeling like something is wrong with me, and that even if men would want to be with me - something would go wrong down the road which inhibits me from even wanting to try. 

I'm desperate for a friend, or at least someone who can relate in any way. I'm tired of feeling so anxious and sad about my current situation. Even my friends back home have seemed to distance themselves from me due to their own intimate/romantic relationships. Does anyone else have this existential dread that they will be alone forever? What about anyone who has transferred to a 4-year university from a community college and has struggled making friends? Someone please tell me it gets better.

19,"So I have diagnosed OCD, and there's definitely a crossover between that and this issue, but in all my research about OCD I haven't been able to find mention of this weird phenomenon at all. I feel like it's less of a symptom of my OCD and more that I think of and adapt to and worry about it in very typical obsessive thought patterns.
Basically, my problem is that I feel, a lot of the time, like someone else is observing what I do, see, hear, feel, etc through my body. I kind of feel a presence, like I'm aware that I'm being watched, but unlike regular paranoia it's not by people around me or people looking through windows or cameras- it's people experiencing what I experience. And it's not a general presence either. It's always people I know. It almost feels like a hypothetical situation, like ""If X person in my life knew exactly what I was doing right now, what would they think?"" It plays out really often with a few people specifically: mainly my boyfriend, one of my teachers, a few close friends. I imagine that they go to sleep and dream that they're in my body. Sometimes it's so bad that I text them to make sure they weren't (not outright asking, but messages that would let me know if they were observing/possessing me). Whenever I feel like I'm being observed, I change what I do and say to... impress the people that I feel are observing me. For example, I can't go into my room when this is happening because it's dirty and I don't want them to see it. I KNOW this is irrational. I just want to know what it is. What's wrong with me?

My father was abusive to me, physically and sexually and my grandmother exposed me to him in the first place.

My grandmother is also verbally abusive to me, and I've pented up so much anger for years while wanting to tell her to ""shut the **** up.""

23,"Hi everyone,

 So I have GAD, Hypochondria and Obsessive thoughts as well as a few compulsions and I'm on SSRI's for my various anxiety disorders and it's been brilliant and i'm only on 10mg a low does and I have been for months and it's been great but both my GP and my Psychiatrist said that they think I should increase it to 15 mg but that really worries me for a variety of reasons

 1. I have put on 8 kg's because of the medication &amp; I hate myself, I was already very unhappy about my weight and was trying to lose some but now I have to lose even more &amp; I can't seem to lose any. Im scared increasing the medication will make me gain even more. I have considered purging or not eating, which I know is a bad idea.

2. Im anxious about taking my medication in general so I hate any kind of change around it. Im afraid I will get side effects. Im especially TERRIFIED of developing Serotonin Syndrome which is deadly

3. I thought I was doing ok, I have been heaps better so I didn't think I'd need to increase it. I will admit I have still been anxious and on top of all of my other anxieties some new obsessive and intrusive thoughts have been occurring, for example I got house plants in my room and I'm afraid that they will cause me to suffocate or hurt me at night because they respire and release carbon dioxide and use oxygen. Im also afraid that putting hoodies under the door (I do this to make a barrier so spiders can't crawl under the door while I sleep, I'v been doing it for over a year) will cause me to suffocate in my sleep from a lack of oxygen. So I can see why they think we should increase it, however I have been doing much better than when I wasn't. 

Also I have been feeling really bad about myself mainly due to my weight and hips &amp; stomach. I have considered not eating or throwing up, which I know is a bad idea, I'm a psych student so I understand how quickly it can develop into mental health issues, but I hate my body and I haven't bought new clothes in 2 years because nothing fits and I cry and have a breakdown everytime I go shopping for clothes becuase I feel increadibly fat and nothing i want fits or suits my body so I have given up. So I just cry in change rooms get in a bad mood and want to die so I just complain and go home and be miserable.

On a side note, I find it hard to reach out to people for help. I don't know how to explain it to others, I make things better than it seem in front of others. But when I'm alone, I feel that my world is collapsing. 

I find it hard to be open about my feelings with people too, I feel that I have no one to understand me and I'm tired of meeting people to only put on a certain mask and not be able to express my true self. But then again I don't know myself well either.

27,"My mother is 54 and over the past year she has been acting strange lately.

I once caught her getting physical with her boyfriend (she was swinging hands and cursing at him right outside her house where I was supposed to meet her). He didn't hit her back or anything but she just embarrassingly made a huge scene.

In another instance we were crossing the sidewalk together and some didn't stop in time and she lost it and started screaming and cursing at the driver. It was a completely inadequate reaction.

I invited her out one time and as we were walking I made a comment that she didn't like (may have had something to do with me leaving the country for a bit) and she stopped in the middle of the street and said ""Don't do it or I will protest!"" And then I said, ""How are you going to protest?"" and then she literally peed onto the street while standing. I was so embarrassed that I drove her home immediately and told her to visit a psychiatrist because I do not think she is well. She hasn't followed through.

She lives with my sister and they recently had to move out. I'm in another country now but I wake up to this email:
""Hey my phone is downstairs, I'm in my apartment.

Mom had a complete breakdown today. She was crying and breaking stuff and being so erratic. I tried to leave she's like just try to fucking punch me, and she smelled like alcohol, and this is just some of it, she has been like that for the last 2 hours. She had a complete breakdown. She's been crying and like put her face in mine and told me to punch her. She totally lost it. She's like Im living in the street, Im living in the street, none of you have ever cared about me. It was so disturbing. She started crying and she was laughing at the same time. And then she's like I dont need nothing from you, and Im like fine, I'm leaving too, and then shes like no dont leave dont leave and fell on the door.""

So I called my mom but she said she was just stressed out and seemed normal.

My sister later messaged me with this:
""Don't say anything to mom, but I think she's going crazy. She's so erratic and volatile. It's really disturbing. Like she asks me the same question 10 times, and after I say no she asks me again.""

28,"In the past few weeks I've started to experience the above feelings in greater amount than I remember ever having before, and the thoughts become more and more intrusive each day, causing me to become anxious about my mental health. 

The self-doubt part of it is more based at work. Even though I know that I'm a good worker and my annual reports reflect that, on a typical working day I find myself checking things more than once because I either feel like I've missed something, or I can't even remember doing something at all. For example I could have put a signature on a form, still have the pen in my hand and closed the form, but I'll still check again just to make sure. In general it sort of makes me believe that people offer praise out of being kind rather than anything I've done, and people depend on me too much. 

More worrying are the intrusive thoughts. Most of the time it's if I'm next to people, and generally consist of random thoughts like, ""What if I just licked this person's face?"" or on several occasions, ""What would happen if I grabbed this woman's breasts?""

Once or twice a day I could maybe understand and ignore, but once a thought has happened it will stay with me the entire time I'm near that person and I find it very difficult to ignore. These kind of feelings made we feel like there's some sort of sexual deviancy inside me, and I'm worried that if I didn't pay attention to my thoughts then my subconscious mind would force me to act of those impulses.

30,"Hi all. First time posting in this subreddit. A few months ago I watched a video about a young woman explaining how she discovered she has depersonalization disorder and it was the first time I ever heard about it and I thought some things she said was relatable but I'm not really one to claim to have a mental disorder unless I go to a professional. So far, mentally I think I'm all right but lately I think I've been having depression because of a recent event. My dad and I got into an argument and he ended up attacking me and punched me in the face a few times and I was very shocked and angry because he used to abuse me as a child a lot but hasn't recently now that I'm a young adult (20F). That happened while I was having finals for college and was having a huge fight with a school group partner who also happened to my best friend for 2 years. I think all 3 major stresses (fighting with dad, fighting with friend, and workload of finals) made me crack and I feel depressed sometimes. Like sometimes I'll be sitting with my boyfriend and we'll be having a good time making jokes but I'll kind of drift off and stare into space and feel numb. 

But back to the depersonalization. The reason why I feel like I might have it is because just a few minutes ago I just finished washing my face and was applying some moisturizer and was just staring off again, but when I looked into the mirror and looked into my eyes I didn't feel.. Real. Like I was doing the action of applying moisturizer and I was watching myself apply it but it didn't feel like I myself was the one doing it but I was an outsider watching someone else do it. And sometimes when I stare in the mirror, which I don't do a lot, I don't feel like I'm real. Like everyone's actions around me are real but I feel more like I'm in a movie and someone's controlling my actions. When I started researching more about Depersonalization disorder it mentioned having bad memory, and boy did this add to my curiosity because I have terrible memory. I remember things more on the description or the visuals, but I am absolutely terrible at remembering names. Names of people, movies, places, definitions, anything. But I can recall something if I see a picture of it or hear the description, I just have a really hard time pairing a name to it. 

I'm not sure if this information will help but when I was younger, occasionally I get this feeling where I used to think my fingers weren't real and that they were either extremely numb or they were numb but felt like they were growing massively (even though they weren't visually but they felt like they were). If anyone suffers with Depersonalization disorder I'd love to hear their input. Thank you 

Edit: Some extra info if it helps, I don't feel this way all the time, seems to happen maybe 2-3 times a year ",27Dec2017,8,
31,"   Apologies in advance if this is long, but I don’t know where else to put it. 


Although it’s probably one of many road blocks, I feel like this is the hardest step. I’ve noticed things in myself over the years that I know should have been addressed, but the stigma behind mental health always steers me in the other direction.

 I come from a family of different mental health issues. My grandmother is schizophrenic among other things, and a few of my family members battle depression and anxiety. Can’t forget to mention drug and alcohol addiction too. 

 When I was a teenager I was diagnosed with ADHD, and from there it was all trial and error with medication. Sometimes I would be on something to help me concentrate, to the point where I would hyper focus on something and get so into my own brain it scared me. Then we tried more of a mood stabilizer, but most of the medications just had me walking around like a zombie. 

  Between growing up watching my grandma be pumped full of lithium and then becoming basically a lab rat myself, I started to shy away from and medication. I figured whatever I had going on wasn’t so extreme that I couldn’t deal with it on my own. That was over ten years ago.

  Fast forward I’m almost 30, I’ve had a full time job for 8 years and a steady boyfriend for almost 9. I can’t say that I’m not happy, because I am. I think I’ve done a good job at keeping whatever ADHD I have left in check, but now I’ve got an issue with anxiety.

   It started when I was driving to class a few months back on a busy highway and I began to feel claustrophobic. I was in the middle lane with cars surrounding me in dead traffic. Soon my body started to sync up with my brain, I was sweating and my heart was racing and I had to get off of that road. I took the closest exit (after some risky maneuvers) and ended up taking the back streets to school. Once I was off of the busy road and out of the situation I was able to calm myself down and see how silly I was acting. But ever since that day I associated that busy main highway with that panic attack, and I’ve taken the backroads to class since. 

  It’s starting to trickle into other areas of my life and I’m finding more comfort in staying home. I know that I need to talk to someone about it, but I’m afraid that if I completely commit to the idea that there’s something ‘wrong’ with me that others will start to just see that. But I also realize that if I don’t help myself I could potentially ruin relationships that are more important to me then anything. 

  If you’ve read this long, thank you. I don’t really know where to go from here, but I’m making a phone call to a local psychiatrist to set up an appointment for this week.

32,"my past is a mess.

I was home tutored and didn't get any qualifications. I missed out on uni. And I really regret it.

I have no friends and I feel like I've missed out on my youth, which I've largely spent going online.

The one thing keeping me going was travel.

But now that dream looks pretty ruined too.

I live in europe. We're having more and more terrorism. A threat that still looms large over us. I'm always checking the news to see if there's been another attack. I've been a bit sheltered so all this is a bit of a shock.

It's so easy for an attack to happen now. They just need a car.

ISIS fighters have fled here. There's more and more salafists here than ever.

I wanted to travel so much, now the time I'm about to go, all this happens. I feel like I've lost this dream as well now.

I just really fear that west will eventually get sharia law imposed, thanks to mass muslim immigration and the fact that they have like ten kids a family.

I just see our way of life disappearing. Being replaced by their uber oppressive way of life.

How can I keep going, knowing our future could be that?  It makes me so miserable, but if I speak out about it, I get called racist and all sort of abuse.

I've just lost all hope. In life, in people, in the future.

I've already lost a lot of motivation to keep going. I've lost travel. I've missed out on uni. I've wasted my youth. I've got no friends. No life.

I've wasted yet another year in 2017. I fell apart this year. I'd go online and rant about all this stuff to do with islam and then afterwards would feel bad for wasting it. I get too angry really. Angry at muslims for all this. Angry at lefties for wanting multiculturalism. If it wasn't for them we wouldn't be in this mess. We wouldn't have so much terrorism and we wouldn't be wondering if our future is islamic.

I didn't use to be like that. Just all this stuff this year and reading stuff from right wingers just changed me I guess. I've lost my love for the world.
 I somehow got to the stage where I was posting constantly, asking whether islam is going to take over europe one day.
 It just screws me up, the fact it could  be our future is too much for me. The fact we could be living under sharia law one day scares me.
 I don't see a positive future anymore and I've just lost all hope.


 But yeah. Another year. Gone.

 I get tormented for all the time I've wasted online. It crushes me I've wasted my youth.

34,"Hi everyone, this is the first time I’ve taken steps to really address my mental state and how my family members affect it, so sorry if it’s a bit incoherent!

Background: I’m a university student on the east coast, originally from California. I have a history with depression (couple years feeling suicidal due to bullying and isolation as a teenager), and have developed what seems to be anxiety issues as of late, though I’ve managed it well enough to only have a few non-serious depressive episodes and panic attacks while living away from home. I’m back in California with my family for the winter break.

I’ve found that being around my family tends to exacerbate mood swings and emotional instability, as my family members themselves have their own unresolved issues, and we don’t really talk about our feelings as much as we just sort of let them out on each other. We are Chinese-American, and I’m first-gen, so my parents care a ton about always seeming ok at all times to others and saving face. 

Right now we’re on our first family vacation in a long time in China, and going into it I was optimistic despite the fact that family vacations have always been stressful and conflict inducing in the past. The last two days have actually been great, we’ve gotten along relatively well and have done generally fun stuff.

It was today, however, that sort of abruptly sent me spiraling. Most of the day was fine, up until dinner with one of my father’s business associates/local friend. My mom made a comment towards the end of the meal about our family dog that really set me off - the friend asked why we didn’t come back to China as often as we liked, and she responded by complaining at length about the needs of our 13 year old senior German Shepherd (literally about him just needing to EAT and relieve himself at inconvenient times of the day for them), ending with a smile and a comment that essentially was “I’m excited for when he dies in a year or so, so we can do more traveling.” 

The dog is like 60% of the reason why I didn’t kill myself when I was a teen - he provided the calming presence I needed when I had episodes like an impromptu therapy dog, and I love him with all my heart. He’s being looked after by my amazing boyfriend while we’re on vacation, who has been spoiling him - the dog is the happiest I’ve seen him in years, in part because my parents don’t give him a lot of emotional fulfillment and just sort of do the minimum to keep him alive because they feel bad. My mom’s quip genuinely infuriated me, and it triggered this rush of memories of her, my dad’s, and my sister’s most callous and uncompassionate moments towards the dog, other people, etc (there are many). I’m always super empathetic, so it’s hard for me to “get” people with low amounts of empathy, and it hurts me to think of my own family as cruel, even though they are.

After the dinner had ended, I told them that I felt tired and sick and wanted to go back to the hotel (we were still going through the time zone change, so I was very tired). They said that their friends had another activity planned and that they didn’t want to say no. The activity was a two-hour tourist boat ride through the super-polluted harbor (plus two more hours of travel time), and my phone had died hours before so I had no way to cope. I was sitting with my resentful thoughts about dinner and frustrations for that time, and spent most of it self-harming by clawing the skin off of my left hand. Despite my history with mental illness, this is the first time I’ve self harmed to this extent. 

It finally hit me that I can’t keep letting this happen every time I go somewhere with my family. I need them to understand that I have boundaries and need them to be respected, that’s just how my brain works. I’m trying to come up with a way to tell them “Hey, I’ve reached my limit for today, please don’t push me as it puts me in a mentally bad place.” I tried expressing this to my sister but it came out as super whiny and childish, and she just rolled her eyes at me and tossed me some hydrocortisone for my hand. My parents also don’t really believe in mental illness, and have always chalked up my issues as something related to hormones, stress, tiredness, etc. Are there better ways of expressing this, in ways that will get them to actually empathize with what I’m going through? 

TLDR: Self harmed while on family vacation. Family members don’t get mental health, am struggling to communicate boundaries and limits in way that isn’t whiny and will actually make them respect my needs.

37,"I don't know how to start... so let's just say that I have depression. And days ago I took some online tests and found out that I have bipolar. But that's not the only thing that I want to get out of my chest.

I don't like reality. I think I spent more time in my imaginary world than the real one. And my own world is not something like the ones that have magical creatures or sci-fi but it's just like the real world that we live in. Things that are different are just some facts, and histories. 

Every single days, I will study anything that I can find on the internet about parallel universes, other dimensions and matrix-reality stuff just to find a way to go to my imaginary world. I start a belief that the world is real and does exists and I need to find my way to go there.

I don't like this world. Lot of people are scary. People fight over religions, ethnicity and some useless stuff. And some people just have crazy mind-set and brainwashed.

But I think the most main reason I don't want to be here is because I feel like I don't belong in here. Of course, this can be appear normal since humans always want to be belong somewhere. But there's a time that I think that I needed somewhere but not in here. Maybe real far like other world or other dimension or stuff like that. But then I just forget it because it's stupid.

People thought that I'm weird or maybe something like dangerous. I can tell that some people hate me. And don't even don't want to get closed with me. But screw that. I don't care.

I guess I enjoy when I found my time to be alone. I feel like  different person, someone more confident and free and happy when nobody is in the house for days. 

During school, people keep saying that I'm weird. But yet the exact same people will come to me if they need help. Even the teachers think I'm weird. But their biggest mistake, is to make me to be like them. I'm no longer a high school student by the way

I guess, some people just hate me. I can tell even from how they walk. Usually they will walk normally but when I'm around, they will be like trying to make an earthquake.

People thought that I do nothing but they're wrong. Maybe I look like freezing but in my head, I keep thinking, and thinking and thinking until I got tired and sleepy. 

I used to try to ask god for help. But no longer since i'm no longer believe in god. My family don't know about it and I want to keep it that way and so as my friends. I do have less than 5 friends but they're just too far.

Sometimes, I think I should kill myself. I wonder why people don't like or get overreacting about suicide. I mean, what if that's they only way to stop the pains?  

But don't worry it's just a thought. I tried and I failed btw but now, I'm still finding a way to go to another world like I mentioned early.

Wow, so long I hope you don't get bored. 

I don't know if this is a problem but I don't really talk to my family. It's like when i'm with them, I'm like a different person and when with friends, I changed. I don't know why. But last time I see my friends are years ago.

I can't focus on important things. Like if I had to study about something that maybe not so interesting but useful, it will take days to start it.

And I like to talk to myself. In fact, it was my own self that reminded me to do this.

And I think I keep creating characters and worlds in my mind. Like when I finished watching a movie like pulp fiction, the two main characters, Jules and Vincent will be the voices in my head and talk just like the characters. I do communicate with them every times. But some of them may not last long. Some of them will be in my head for really long time. One of them is Deadpool and his other two voices. Ugh!

I'm also have a habit where I would explain something like scenes to myself when watching movies even though I already understand it.

Sometimes, I took a scene or useless stuff too serious when watching movies. I don't know how to explain this but it's like when the character do some normal stuff, I would rewind it to see it again to see how and what the character did. It's really annoying because if I don't do it, it will stressful and if I do, I can't stop. That's why I took 4 hours for 2 hours movie.

I can get furious or mad about little things like slow internet or something like that. And it's not just like normal anger, but it's like when you're ready to kill someone. But I don't express it. I just do nothing and be quiet but put a lot of pressure in my head. Like i'm trying to blow it.

And I always daydreaming. Like when I watch a movie on tv, sometime I would accidentally imagine the scene in my head. Like i'm part of it. It can be serious sometime like I got too active then suddenly walk fast to other place like kitchen for no reason.

I used to have a dream. I wanted to an astronaut but as I grow up, that's impossible. And i'm pretty stupid. But then I have another dream. I wanted to be actor. Not just like lack of skill actors in my country in stupid tv shows but more than that. Maybe like Hollywood. But again, I try to forget it simply because it's impossible. And i'm ugly.

Sometime, when I look the stars. I feel like I'm not from here. Not like alien stuff but I feel like I had a great adventure. But yes, I feel like i'm not from this planet or world. And I really miss something. But I don't know what is it. And like I mentioned earlier, I feel like i'm needed somewhere but not here. Like people will die or suffer if i'm not there.

I'm always fail in life. Especially something I hope will succeed. It's stupid when I think that I fail because I must die. I mean like maybe it's one of ways for 'them' to kill me by put me in depression so I will commit suicide.

So the last thing I wanna share is I can see scary things on reflection. Not like mirrors but reflections on objects. I know what I see, but maybe my brain play tricks with me like creating being from other objects reflections.

So hopefully, this is the right place since I believe I have mental problem or problems. And I'm in depression every days. I'm really sorry if it's too long. I think maybe this will help me a little since I  always in big depression every days. And please tell me what is the name of my mental disorder from this story. 

Sorry if my english is not that good.

I have had depression for over a decade now. I have been recently diagnosed with Avoidance Personality Disorder, I've struggled with anxiety most of my life, and I don't have really a happy outlook on things.

Recently, life has been really tumultuous. I've gained 100lbs since highschool. I'm a compulsive liar and have to constantly catch myself saying bullshit that doesn't matter. I have a severe chronic illness that limits my ability to enjoy lifting like I used to and makes the winter especially unbearable. I had one last refuge of things I love, my hair, and last night it started breaking off two inches from my scalp and large chunks are falling out.

Basically, I've lost everything I've taken pride in. I have no time for self care between moving apartments and work, I have no privacy living with my partner at his parents house, and at this point I feel like unless I do drugs, this is my rock bottom. I've had full on panic attacks at work from all the daily stress, but I can't cut back on hours because it is paying for my insurance and education.

How do you find self esteem when you're unable to enjoy anything physically or mentally about your self? How do you keep going when life keeps throwing roadblocks in your way? I feel like at this point, nothing matters. I'm starting college after all my friends have graduated, I'm trying to improve my health while it rapidly declines, I can't even get a grip on my mental health without fifty other problems hitting me over the head.

41,"Hi there!

I'm a bit drunk and looking for some company, but am at home alone right now so I decided to post here and see what happens. Let's talk!
  
So the reason why I'm posting here in Mental Health is that my supposed egoism plays a big role in my interactions with others and feels pretty unnatural so I have a feeling it has to do something with my mental health. Let me elaborate a bit. 

Recently I started feeling very egoistic. While not entirely sure about the reasons for it, I think there always was a bit of egoism in me since early childhood, and it is only now that I started coming to terms with it. The realization was pretty painful, but then I also realized this egoism of mine actually makes life much easier

- Whenever I talk with others I tend to concentrate on my thoughts and feelings, and myself in general - trying to connect the dots in order to understand my own problems better, applying their situations and problems to mine, and so on.
- I find it pretty hard to remember stuff about other people, even when they tell me the same thing several times. They often get angry when they find out I don't remember anything. At the same time, remembering my own problems is not a problem at all.
- I am somewhat afraid of serious relationships. This is a serious and strange topic, a problem that surfaced only recently - I've always wished to be in a long, stable romantic relationship and to have deep, meaningful friendships, but now find it almost impossible to dive in either of those. Keeping many surface relationships is much easier and more comfortable for me for some reason, even though I somehow feel it's not my natural state. 
- My family relationships are fucked. Home is where I am the most egoistic I could've ever imagined. I just stopped to care about these people and only do the bare minimum now to sustain what's left. It hurts, because I know my family loves me very much and would sacrifice anything for my happiness, however I just don't want to be around them anymore and feel pretty depressed and aggressive at home. 
- All interaction with friends and colleagues at work for me comes down to this mini-game of earning social points, either by simply talking to them and hearing them out, or making their days better. I have nice relationships with many people and find it pretty easy to get in touch with strangers, but I don't feel that it's a genuine desire to make them happy. What I'm usually after is some kind of praise and love and nice things in return, and sometimes I get upset when they don't even notice what I do for them (and yes, I know that's irrational when you genuinely want to just make people happy). 
- My biggest dream as of now is to travel the world, and it is just now that I realized one of the hidden reasons this idea appeals so much to me. You see, traveling as I imagine it (as in having no plans, hitchhiking, spending only a little time at one place and so on) means that I will have lots and lots of surface relationships - in other words, I won't have to remove my mask and will rely heavily on the first impression, which I'm pretty good at, while not having to reveal any deeper feelings and flaws that I have, and not disappointing people and myself as a result. No plans, no obligations, but a lot of freedom.

However, I have an extremely strong feeling that there's much more to the problem than this, and that this state is not natural for me. A part of me still needs and years for deep, loving, serious relationships with people; I still want to be loved and love others unconditionally. This egoistic position as I see it is just a very comfortable place for me to be right now. Perhaps it's a defense mechanism against some psychological harm. I don't know.

Just a couple years ago I was - or felt, at least - very different. I still want people to be happy regardless of myself and what I want and feel. 

Do you guys have any thoughts on this? I'm all for a deep conversation, if you're up to it as well. It's very much possible I just can't connect the dots somewhere to be able to see the bigger picture, but perhaps you might help me with that?

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I feel very egoistic, especially lately. Above are several observations that I've made recently that all seem to confirm this. 

To a degree, being an egoist is more than okay for me - it's a very comfortable position. However, I feel that it's pretty unnatural for me, and there seems to be some kind of barrier that blocks me from engaging in deeper, meaningful relationships with people. Usually I don't really care about it, but sometimes I feel pretty miserable and have no idea what to do. ",27Dec2017,2,
42,Hi! What are some specific things you guys do to manage your symptoms of anxiety and/or depression that work well for you? I’m starting therapy soon but I think it’d be nice to hear from other people who are going through something similar to what I’m dealing with. ,27Dec2017,2,
43,"I just got out of a depression phase but the doctor insisted I take pills for ""anxiety"". I just took half a pill of 10mg escitalopram and fell asleep after almost vomiting. Now I'm in bed angry, mildly suicidal, breathing heavy, and having a horrible cold sweat... What do I do? I'm ready to dump these pills out. I was fine.

44,"My brother is in distress and I am not sure what to do. Any help/guidance that can be provided is much appreciated. 

He is 38. Never married. No kids. Never even really had a girlfriend. Never had much of a social life or friends. He is not that attractive and he never did well in school. He was definitely a mama’s boy through and through. And herein lies the problem. Our mother passed away two years ago. So he is now totally alone, still living in the house that we grew up in (our dad had a stroke a few years back and is in a nursing home). 

At first things weren’t so bad as I think he had work to keep him busy. He also went to the gym a lot. He was a super recluse and it became impossible for anyone to reach him (phone, email, he would even ignore knocking on the door, etc). I live two hours away and unfortunately can’t check up on him as much as I’d like. But whenever I did see him he seemed in good spirits and his usual self. He worked for Sears. So now that they have gone belly up, he is unemployed.  

Normally we always spend Xmas at our aunts (who is just around the corner from his place), but he didn’t show up. When I asked he just said he didn’t want to celebrate Xmas this year. I saw him yesterday and he seemed in a more disheveled state, and when I asked him about his plans and stuff he was just talking paranoid crazy. Like “Life is fake. Life is the matrix. We are all just being controlled. There is no point in trying. I have no good skills. I don’t care...  etc”

Also while the house was in its usual shape. He had actually trashed my mom’s old bedroom. 

I recognize that my brother is now on the edge and is likely close to either hurting himself or someone else. But I am not sure how to fix this. He is an extremely stubborn person and will never admit he has a problem (especially with his current doomsday outlook on life). He hates responsibility, and loves to just hide himself from the truth, shutting himself from the outside world by just staying in his bedroom and losing himself in multiple computer games. 

He lives in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. I live in Ottawa, Ontario and am not sure what resources are available there. I feel like he needs something where they force him to do the right things and take the necessary steps in order to take care of himself. Where they check up on him everyday to make sure he is doing it. I don’t think something like that really exists unless you just committed a crime and you are under some sort of provincial mandate, or jail which of course I don’t want this to end up as. Any ideas?",27Dec2017,1,
45,"So I don’t want to explain everything but I believe one of my friend’s neighbors believes we did something to his tires when he believes in his mind we did, but I’m pretty sure he did it himself and is threatening to call the police. Could this be a sign of schizophrenia? Help..

48,"I'm a 32-year old male Psych major whom has endured severe depression and anxiety since my early youth. It was pretty bad, and lasted for nearly 14 years, getting progressively worse with each passing year, up until four months ago. I felt like I was stuck in a swamp, and didn't know how to break free. With the small amount of will-power I had, I kept moving along, thinking that maybe there was a way out... But for the longest time, nothing seemed to work, which destroyed my spirit even more. But, I still kept going... and now I'm here. I never, ever, thought I would be free from those feelings. Giving up is never the answer. There is always a way out, remember that.

So, through a series of trial and error of different medication/psychologists/psychotherapists/life coaches/neurofeedback, and the will to keep moving forward amidst any setbacks, one thing led to another, led to another... and I have successfully overcome my depression and anxiety... The feelings are gone, and if/when they rear their ugly heads again, I have more power and control over them. they can't affect me anymore.

Is anyone in the Dallas/Fort-Worth area interested in meeting up in a public space and talking about their mental health recovery and/or current struggles in an open, mature, supportive environment? 

Why I'm doing this:  One of the most important things for my personal recovery has been staying authentic around everyone in my outer reality, no matter who it was... friends, family members, co-workers, professors, grocery store clerks, etc. In essence, It was the act of proving to myself that I was worthy of having my inner-voice be heard that changed my own attitude toward myself, aiding my ability to recover. I'm doing this because other people have remarked how they felt comfortable sharing their own inner-voice around me which inspired them to embrace their true selves as well. Doesn't hurt to put this out there!

If you are interested, shoot me a message or reply back! ",27Dec2017,9,

51,"The best way I can describe it is like some sort of sensory overload. I have depression and anxiety and I’m not on meds nor have I seen a therapist yet. It’s just expensive and tbh I’m super scared. For example, when watching a movie that has a lot of excitement like action I start crying and shaking and idk why because obviously I’m enjoying the movie. Another example is when I rode the flight ride in Pandora at Animal Kingdom. Avatar is one of my favorite movies and the ride was so realistic and amazing I started crying and couldn’t stop the whole time but I had a blast. 

Is there a word for this or is this just another form of anxiety? ",27Dec2017,2,
52,"Just feel like I need to let this out and speak to people as it’s hard for people to relate or help when I open up in person.

Basically over Xmas a situation occurred where my car had trouble, garage advised better off not driving to parents 200 miles away and get a rental car.

Rental car place has no cars left. Rang parents and told them I can’t come down for Xmas break because of not having transport, basically got spoken to like shit and insinuated that I’m lying and ruined Xmas.

I have not taken this well and now don’t feel welcome or wanted.

Backstory to my childhood in a nutshell:

- Dad beat me up as a kid. Whenever I did a good piece of work I was lying and faked it somehow. Dad beat Mum. Dad has rinsed my Mum dry for money all her life and not worked since I was 6.

- Used to be close with Mum but since I moved away 10 years ago it’s been constant emotional blackmail. I’m never visiting long enough and I never love her enough. Nothing is ever good enough.
(Got her a £50 food hamper for mother’s day and she asked where the card was...never said thank you)

53,"What is really hurting me is my lack of social life. I haven't had an actual person to talk to regularly for over six years, almost seven. 

I'm going to get to the point. I haven't been out with a friend for over six years. I ask them to hang out. They say no or they say that they are busy. I ask to get back to me when they are available, and they never do. I try making new friends. 

It is really affecting my mental state. I talk to people online (because that is my only option at this point) to try and make up for it, and it has worked only temporarily. When I want to talk to someone in real life, the thought of it makes my face start tensing up because I need it desperately, but I definitely know I won't get it.

I feel like I am wasting my teenage years when they are supposed to be fun. I'm decently fit, my grades are fine, I'm not very weird, and I talk normally to people. People don't give me a chance. There's not much I can do about it except for wait it out.

If people in my life don't want to talk to me, there isn't something wrong with society, but something wrong with me. Maybe it is the boring life I have due to people not wanting to hang out with me that is causing no one to want to talk to me.

Every time I daydream about me and someone just talking outside of school, I have this sensation where I'm happy but I hurt due to it probably not going to happen.

I don't consider myself suicidal or anything, but having minimal human interaction for over six years is hurting me a lot. I'm not depressed, I really just can't handle the lack of social interaction over the past six years, as it is making me insane. I don't want to die, but at the same time I want to die just to not be crazy.

I've tried everything I can, but no one seems to care about me. I've just about given up.",27Dec2017,26,

56,"i can't trust my friends and family's judgement since they're thinking for me and it is biased, i need to get some outsiders' opinions. i hope you'll be able to give me your honest opinion on my dilemma. this is going to be really long, i apologize, my thoughts are extremely scattered atm. my ex-boyfriend was and is very suicidal. we knew each other before, we played in the same band but didn't know a lot ab each other. we only started becoming close friends when he left to canada to study. he was gonna kill himself in canada, and back then, i managed to convince him to wait until he comes back and i'll try and help him. we started dating when he came back, i thought i was in love and i could help him somehow but as time passes, i fell out of love with him and was just emotionally drained in general. i still care about him, so we kept talking after we broke up, maybe that wasn't a good idea since he is in love with me and i'm giving him some kind of hope. i just wanted to be friends with him, but he kept saying we can't be friends, so eventually i just gave up and we got back tgt again (i asked him out), i thought i could just try to love him since he's a nice person deep down and we get along (i thought it might made him happier, have something to look forward to, i don't know..), he has said many times that if it wasn't for me he would have killed himself. he said he has nothing to lose anyways so he accepted my offer. that didn't work out, i broke it off with him again a few months in when he went back to canada (part of it was because i can't do long distance relationship too). and again we still maintained contact because i don't want him to kill himself, and he's got no one other than me, literally. he loves his mom but because they're so different, they always fight about everything. he doesn't talk to his dad and brother. his best friend blocked him, he doesn't maintain contact with any of his former high school friends, and he says he doesn't trust anyone (but me) nor rly consider anyone his friend. he had stopped going to university completely and just stay at home without talking to anyone but me online. we had mutual friends but when i see them and asked if they still talk to him, they said no, because he was too negative, they all said they're living a happier life without contacting him, which i find horrible at the time and felt very angry... but, i turned out to be the same. these few days we've been constantly having small arguments, he says he can't trust me anymore and he feels like i'm toying him, he says i'm distancing myself (which i guess i was since i don't want him to like me or for him to get the wrong idea while still keeping contact with him), he told me i don't understand the fact that he wants to kill himself everyday. i felt so awful, i didn't know what to do. i told him he really need to get professional help, therapists payed thousands of dollars to study years in schools just to be able to work with people and i'm happy to help him with the process, but he refuses to, he says the only person he wants to talk to is me and he can't trust a stranger. he says he feels like i betrayed and abandoned him since i've said all those things while we were dating like i'll be there for him and now i can't keep my promises. which he is right. i shouldn't have said those things so lightly. i know that's extremely selfish of me but i have no romantic feelings for him anymore. after those arguments, we spent a few days thinking and i've come to think that i definitely do not want him to kill himself, and he haven't got anyone else but me, so i texted him and told him what i thought, he said he can't live without me, so we agreed to keep contact, and i said i'll try to stop distancing myself, and be as natural and ""normal"" as possible. it was alright for a few days, but then yesterday i followed a guy i used to like on instagram which is also a person that he despises, and he talked to me about him before. it pissed him off that i disregard all the bad things about he had told me about the guy i used to like that at the time i acknowledged and listened to him, but now i prove to him that i lied to him since i still want to follow the other guy. that sets me off too and i had a rage saying that i'm sick of him analyzing every single thing i do, i'm sick of him stalking me on every social media (he admitted that he does that), that i can do whatever i want, and it's none of his business, in anger i just said i don't want to contact him anymore because i'm spent and i have no feelings for him anymore and nothing matters. after fighting for a while and everything sort of were settling down i was telling him i'm a rotten person deep down and just because he thinks i'm better than the rest i'm really not, and i suggest him blaming me for making everything worse than it should've been (because i truly believe so, i deeply regret what i've done to him, and my mindset that what i was doing was the best was fucked up), only to leave him in the end like everyone else, he says he knows all of those bad things ab me and he still think i'm less rotten than them, then he finally says alright, thank you for giving me the feeling of hope, etc. and blocked me right away. it's been a day from that now and even though i don't love him anymore, i can't stop thinking about if what i did was the right thing or not, what if he kills himself and i was the one capable of stopping it but i'm just too selfish to just try conversing with him for a while until he can come back home. right now i still can't believe i actually said that, i've always thought about stop contacting him one day but never thought that i would actually do it. i left him when he needs me the most... but at the same time i have no feelings for him anymore. i was thinking of going to his house (his parent's house here, not in canada) and actually telling his mom about his condition, maybe she'll listen, he wouldn't want me doing that, but even if i don't talk to him anymore i don't want him to die and maybe she could do something about it. anyways that's besides the point. i'm sorry that this is extremely long, my thoughts are all over the place. do you think what i did was wrong? please tell me if it really is, i really, really need to know, because this will be the biggest mistake i'll ever make if what i did is truly not the brightest, i know i am extremely selfish but i could've tried harder... personally, i can't trust my own judgement but this heavy, heavy guilt i'm feeling must say something. thank you for taking out the time to read this. have a great day.

57,"So I've always been a very unstable person and recently it's all come crashing down on top of me - I'm not sure if it's the Christmas season, being home from uni, or a mix of the two. 
My main problems began when I was around 12/13 which I don't want to get into right now but the reason I bring it up is because it's been playing on my mind a lot recently - flashbacks of things long since over but giving me real terror and panic attacks as if the memories were live. This is almost certainly to do with the fact that I am back in the town I grew up in which increases the chance of me running into someone from my past. The problem here is that I can't escape it - I'll be relaxing on the sofa watching a film one moment then the next second I'm curled up on the floor shaking and crying because of the sheer levels of anxiety I'm dealing with. 
The next problem is my parent's recent divorce. The divorce itself didn't bother me all that much but the depression that my dad has fallen into is ruling our lives and he uses me as a therapist - I'm about to turn 20 so I don't really have the life experience or the emotional stability to be able to support him which makes me feel extremely guilty. 
My other issues are harder to solve. There's a conspiracy against me that dates all the way back to when I was about 12. There's a group of people who I don't know but see often that I'm sure are turning people against me. There's an old woman and a bald guy that rides an expensive looking racing bike that I see the most often. I'm sure they're the ones orchestrating everything. 
I've been diagnosed with BPD and generalised anxiety disorder but nothing seems to help. 
I don't even know the point of this I just needed to get it out and I no longer trust therapists. ",27Dec2017,1,
