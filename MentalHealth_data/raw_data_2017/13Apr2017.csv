2,"Hi everyone. I recently got my boyfriend to start seeking general life counseling. I know that finding the right one is extremely important. He recently lost around 100lbs and struggles with seeing himself as successful, has self defeating thoughts and a bit of anxiety. What kind of counselor should he seek out? 

Thank you in advance! ",13Apr2017,1
9,"Context: A few months ago I figured out that I had a mild form of bipolar 2. I had previously thought that I was just severely depressed, but I felt that there was more to it than that and was eventually given an antipsychotic. 

It has helped... I think? Sometimes I feel like I don't need it. After all, I functioned effectively enough for 20 years before being medicated, so it can't be that bad, can it? 

I feel like I'm faking. In some ways I feel like I have to remind myself to hate myself. Or remind myself to ""act sad"". I'm not doing it for attention. And rationally, I have to tell myself that if I truly didn't have anything wrong with me the meds would probably affect me differently. 

I KNOW that there's something wrong with me because of the endless cycle. Promising my friends I'll send them awesome birthday cards and then never doing it. Hating myself because I feel like I've lied to them, and then hating myself more for thinking that I would ever get the motivation to do it in the first place. Thinking that my friends will hate me forever because I didn't do what I said I would do. I don't think this happens to normal people. 

Despite this rational thinking, I still find myself questioning my own intentions. Do I really not do it for the attention? Am I pretending because mental illness is seemingly becoming the new normal? I have a friend with a more severe form of bipolar 2 and his swings from mania to depression are very clear, as opposed to me. Because I don't compare to him, I feel like I'm not actually sick. I feel like I'm living a lie. ",13Apr2017,11

14,"TW in advance. In the past 2 years. I failed two years at uni. I was mugged st knife point. Leading to a PTSD diagnosed. I've gained 3 stone. I'm now 18 stone. I was cheated on my my girlfriend of 8 1/2 years and dumped. I've attempted suicide 4 times. I told my ex when I attempted the first time and she called the police with false allegations of harassment leading to me being detained for 21 hours. By far the scariest experience of my life. I've still not gotten over her even after that. She was emotionally abusive as well. She stripped me of all connections to friends, of my interests, of myself. But she was my first love and even after almost a year now I'm still not recovering. I self harm a lot. I'm at the point now where I feel like I will attempt again soon. I have no future. Nothing interests me anymore. Nothing makes me happy for more than a minute before I'm back to feeling like this. I don't know what to do anymore. Honestly if things do t get better soon I know I will attempt. I'm lost. And although I tried to reach out for help I've received none professionally. Just been put on waiting lists that are 6 or more months long. I think I just give up. I'm posting this hoping that someone knows a way forward. Because the only option I see is to end my life.

17,"I write things, as the name suggests, and am working on a run of comic books. People get their powers from a failed attempt of government sterilization, the people that were targeted are all those who have been in history targeted (gay, POC, mentally ill or perceived as such, poor etc.) One of my character's mom was ""sterilized"" because she was bipolar, and now my powered character, about 17, has been diagnosed with Bipolar II. So I had some questions in order to avoid portraying it incorrectly and/or insultingly.

1) how often do the cycles of Hyper-mania/(for my character because bipolar II) and depressive happen? Like how long are you in one before you move to the other?

2) Is the change sudden or gradual?

3) Are there medium times? Like times when you are neither Manic/Hyper-manic or depressive.

4) What are things that keep people off their medication? What are the side effects that make it not worth it?

5) I already have some from looking around, but any specific experiences or general feelings during the various episodes both on and off medication would be appreciated.

6) Anything else you think it's important for me to know before starting.

Obviously most of these are personal and wouldn't apply to everyone with the disorder, but that's sort of what I'm looking for. I don't want my character to be the average/general of what the disorder means so having specific things would help. Basically let me mine your lives and/or serious conditions for my dumb comic book you guys. Thanks for indulging me.",13Apr2017,1
18,"Uh, first time posting here.. about once or twice a week I have the absolute worst sleep. 
Whenever I try to lie down I focus on calming down and try controlling my breathing by making it slower and less erratic, but my heart beating just takes over and makes me focus on it too much. I can't help but notice how it's goes a little faster than normal or something. I try calming myself down to make me more relaxed but end up breathing faster and making it go faster and I just keep making it worse and worse. Next thing you know I'm in the bathroom drenched in sweat heaving over the toilet at 3 in the morning. I'm losing sleep every few days with this, and I don't know why I do it... how can I not focus on my heart rate or breathing or whatever so much and just lie down? I'm sorry if this doesn't fit the sub, but I don't really know where else to post... I know this isn't too serious compared to what other people go through but it's just really annoying. I have anxiety throughout the day if that helps.

19,"Hi guys, this isn't a thread asking for advice, but I'd be more than glad to give it. 

I have psychosis NOS, which is similar to schizophrenia. I've been struggling with it for 3 years, trying to stay in school and trying to stay alive. Usually I'd have constant symptoms and then a relapse every semester where the voices/visuals got bad and scary and I couldn't focus on anything to the point of not being able to study or read. Anyways, when things got bad and I was thinking of ending it, or terrified of going to the hospital, mostly terrified of the future, a lot of the time I'd come here. It sounds stupid but you guys are one of the reasons I'm still here. 

For the last 8 months I've been symptom free, a lot happier, and haven't had any relapses. I even took the GRE for the first time (I want to go to grad school for biology) and got a great score, even better than I needed to get into the grad school I want. I had been worried because my cognitive test showed significant impairment. 

Anyways, by this point I'm sure you're wondering what the point of me writing this is. I guess I just wanted to thank you guys, and offer encouragement to those still struggling. 

I'm not going to sit here and act like it always gets better, sometimes it goes up and down, and sometimes things never get truly better. I will say that even in the worst of times, I was still able to find things to live for. Small things, like my cat walking his fat ass on my chest, his little feet digging into my sternum, then lying down and purring. My dog running like an idiot through the yard and ultimately running into the gate. When it's the first cold morning and it hurts your feet to walk across the cold wet grass. I had to actively look for these things, as my depression would have me ignore them. I guess my point is, sometimes it's the little things that keep us going, and that's alright. If you're only here because there's no one else to feed your fish, that's a good enough reason.",13Apr2017,3
20,"I just got out of the hospital recently for one of my multiple attempts. Not the first time, and maybe (hopefully not) not the last. This time it feels different though, I have resources, amazing doctors, therapy classes, and traditional therapies, and all government paid becuase the Canadian healthcare system (suck it Americans) It's not just that though, I feel that I am in a better mental state than the last few times of leaving the hospital. I am in a better position mentally and support wise coming back to the real world. All this saying, being suicidal was a sort of coping mechanism for me (as unhealthy of a coping mechanism you can get) and it worked well to suppress the even deeper and even more horrid feelings than being suicidal. Without that now, life is just hitting the living shit out of me. All of the things I used to dismiss  because i thought I wouldn't be here to much longer, are now prevalent issues that I have to face normally. It is hard, and there are a lot of them. So much of me wants to go back to that coping to escape the pressure, anger, guilt, and pain. My original strategy for dealing  with these things is gone now, so I have to find new strategies, tools, coping mechanisms (healthy ones), and a lot more. It is a lot of work, normally something that takes years to learn, I have to learn very fast. I will get there, it is just a lot of work, a lot of classes and therapy, and a lot of willpower, which sometimes I doubt if I even have. I like to believe that when I say things such as this, I am being to hard on myself, and that I can do it, or that the view I have no is scewed by some sort of mental illness or some shit like that, but, these concerns are not that. They are something I should be concerned about. The road to self recovery is a longs and steep one, I just started, and I am already out of breath. I have been out of the hospital for about one week now, and I still haven't gone to a single class, and all of this becuase I am simply lazy. That is the thing I am worried about the most, me just simply being to lazy to stop what I am doing and get the help I need. Then of course the possibility of me not being able to do all this, then relapsing ( it would be my last relapse(in a bad way)) scares the living shit out of me. I used to look at life so bleakly to justify being suicidal and I see that is not how my life is. There is so much out there for me, all I have to do is hang on until then. Now seeing that I do want to live makes it even worse. I won't care in the moment, and will kill myself despite everything. The shear disconnect and difference between how I normaly am and how I am in the episodes scares me.The uncertainties are always on my mind, always looming. It is literally the threat of death that could take me in the span of a couple hours, hanging (phrasing ) over me all the time, and no matter how much I don't want it to happen, it happens anyway. I fight it, most of the times I win, other times, no matter how hard I fight, i don't win. Even worse, there are times where I am in a mind state where I don't even fight it, and let everything roll over me, it is much easier to relapse than to fight, and sometimes, I just don't have that fight. I am in a tight corner, becuase I have no room for error, one loss of a fight can mean the end of me, and I have many, many battles ahead. At this point, I just keep telling myself I can do it, even when I think I can't, and that has been working so far. Hope is the number one weapon I utilize in these fights, but the sword is getting dull, and I don't know if it can always be there to aid me in the fights to come.

27,"At work, I'm ""known"" for being scatter brained and a bit forgetful,  but a) I have had a medication increase which has helped and b) I'm more competent than people in my department give me credit for. 

There have been a few times where my line manager has told me one thing, then told me the opposite, and claimed that she told me to do the latter all along. Typical line manager stuff. Also forgetting I've told her when I've put a piece of work in her tray (that she heard and responded ""thank you"" too) then  telling me off for not letting her know where it is. Thing is when I try to explain myself, she brusquely cuts me off with a ""look it doesn't matter just, next time"". 

Here's why it belongs here. She knows of my mental health issues. 

I had an absence review recently where I disclosed my depression and anxiety diagnoses as well as the ways I was managing them. I think she's using this, and my ditzy reputation, to cover her mistakes when it comes with me. Subconsciously or consciously.

So I put it to you all:

30,"A little back story, husband was a ex-alcoholic, that had took a toll on our relationship but eventually he stopped and occasionally smokes weed.  But he had been displaying some usual behaviors, like getting completely zoned out at night.  That usually happens when he was out for a while, which he claims to be him jogging too much.  He was finally convinced to go to the doctors and did some testing (no results back yet), doctor suggested him to lay off excising for a bit and eat some snacks because he might have low blood sugar.  But even when he doesn't do anything intensive, he still gets to that mode.  Maybe he just was too high, but he wasn't like that when he smoked before.  He can get very irrational in that state, the night before he decided to go outside the apartment door and down stairs naked or barely with a jacket on multiple times, I tried to stop him but I couldn't.  Usually he just tends to annoy me by constantly calling out for me when I'm doing something.  Or I have to supervise him eating because he might get messy and I don't want it on the carpet.  I feel bad blaming him for things in the morning because I feel frustrated, because it's like blaming a sleepwalker of their actions. He said he does remember certain things but he doesn't know why he does them.  He said he might just be not getting enough sleep and burnt out from work.  Maybe he does need to relax more, but I don't think this could be the ultimate excuse considering I have to fill in his share of the responsibilities when he can't do them, and have school and work to worry about. But I don't know what could cause  this, considering he just stop being an alcoholic maybe 2 month ago (I'm trusting him to stay sober).  Maybe some chemical in him is out of wack?  Hopefully it's something minor and maybe the doctor can prescribe something and not some damage to his brain.    ",13Apr2017,1
32,"Hello Everyone.  My mother has, undiagnosed, Schizotypal Personality Disorder (STPD).  For those of you unfamiliar, her behavior is characterized by hearing voices, believing in imaginary/magical concepts, delusion, lack of friends, social and general relationship paranoia.   

My father deals with her illness by avoiding, accepting, and ignoring her behaviors at the expense of his emotional well being.  My sister, who skipped town long ago, is more outspoken about my mother's behaviors with her, however, this typically results in screaming arguments and periods of not talking.  I was the first born and forced into the role of being the emotional adult from the moment I could communicate.   

I'm now 33 and have been working with a therapist on this very subject to much self-benefit.   I've suffered from major anxiety, stress, and related depressions for most of my life and am finally at a point where I feel like I am living my life for MYSELF for the first time.   I hold no ill will towards my mother and generally feel empathetic for the torture she endures on a daily basis.  I love and want a relationship with my mother, but it has to be under terms that are favorable to my mental health.   

This is wear things get hairy:   

A few weeks back, I tried a new strategy that my therapist recommended, and set a boundary with my mother that I did not want to meet her to discuss a family matter that we had previously been arguing about.  She reacted child-like and stamped her feet and shouted and I responded by taking a communication break.  She tried to call me twice a few days later and did not leave a message, text, email.

My birthday was the following week and I had not called her back and she had not called me.  I received a birthday card from her, however she augmented her handwriting on the front of the envelope so that I would not know it was from her.  At the behest of my wife, I sent my mother a text thanking her for the card, she wished me well, and the conversation was over in 4 texts between the two of us.   

Yesterday, I walked out into the parking lot to leave work, and there she was waiting in her car.  I asked her what she was doing there and she immediately told me that she had my birthday present.  I told her that showing up like that was improper and unexpected and that she should have called, texted, emailed.  She became visibly shaken (both in body and voice); I could tell she was distressed, and she told me that she had wanted meet me to tell me that she knows my wife does not like her and that my wife is trying to sabotage all of her relationships.    

My wife has been outspoken about agreeing with me on certain familial issues in the past in front of my mother and has struggled to build a true relationship with her due to my mother's behaviors; however, she has been nothing but cordial, warm, and accepting of her whenever we are together.  To further complicate matters, my wife has been the major proponent behind me seeking professional help for my own mental wellness.  I have come very far over the past few years and have mostly overcome anger issues/anxiety/depression, gained self-esteem that I felt I could never have, and have realized my full potential in both personal and professional capacity.   

Back to the parking lot, my mother was also under the false impression that I had cut her out of my life and did not want a relationship with her anymore.  This statement is false and a creation of my mother's paranoid delusions; I admit being at fault for not contacting her and setting this thought process in motion.  I told my mother that none of these thoughts were true, that I love her and want to continue working on our relationship, and that I needed to collect my thoughts before we resumed this conversation and left.   

I went home and spoke with my wife and have been filled with a pain that I had not felt before.  My wife is wholly supportive of me, but is now scared of my mother's irrational behavior and thinking.  I do not want to cause my mother any more pain than she already endures, but I can't release myself from emotional imprisonment without doing so to some degree.   

I know this isn't a black and white issue with a single solution.  Thank you to anyone who has taken the time to read my story.  I'm trying to be as zen as possible and ride the waves, but this pain is new and unexpected and unlike anything I've experienced.

**TLDR:** My mother has Schizotypal Personality Disorder (STPD) and I've been her emotional rock for 33 years.  For my own mental wellness, I'm starting to pull away from that role and it is causing upheavel.

45,"My father has experienced several traumatic moments in the last few years and on top of that has been burdened by serious stress due to
1. A very serious problem around november-december where he coughed for 5-15 minutes continuously. After plenty of investigations and hospitalizations it was diagnosed as asthama.
2. A serious financial problem due to practically all our business being shut down for the past few months, and seriously dwindling in the past few years
3. Serious recent family matters where a dispute with an influential family member threatening to get him cut off with his entire side of the family

As of now, my father is extremely irritable. He often scolds customers in our shop for the tiniest inconvenience they may cause him, often ranting for 10-15 minutes. He also contnuously rants at me (I can handle it) and my mother, often about even the tiniest thing he perceives as an error/mistake. The environment is continuously tense at our shop due to this behavior, hence resulting in a significant decrease in customers.
He's also often extremely negative, but that seems to have changed somewhat in the last few days when our business eased up a little.

However deep down he's also very troubled due to these many points of stress and I'm afraid that merely visiting a psychiatrist will in turn cause him to think he's losing his mind, adding a lot more stress on top.
I already talked to him about visiting a psychiatrist, he always keeps says tomorrow/after i visit this other doctor e.t.c.
He also acknowledges that he has a problem (Although he still wouldn't acknowledge individual incidents, always justifying/attacking you if you point out such treatment of a customer) but he also says that he'd like to work on it himself rather than visit a psychiatrist.

52,"I've never done inpatient before. But I wanted to kill myself. I had a plan, and the means to execute that plan. My psychosis was coming back with a vengeance.

I originally went to a private psych hospital, but I fucked up my paperwork. I put mL instead of mg as the unit of measurement on my methadone. Because it was 8pm and they couldn't verify the actual dose, they sent me to the ER. 

I was there for 3 and a half fucking days. And my god was that horrible. Everyone that worked there was terrible. The nurses, the techs, everyone. They treated me like I wasn't even a human being. They gave me the bare minimum for medication, not even enough to help the symptoms. They didn't care that the voices were so bad I couldn't sleep. That I saw shadows moving around me constantly.

Once I was transferred to their behavioral health unit 3 almost 4 days later, it did get better. I actually got medication that worked. I went to groups, including a CBT one. They helped. I probably should have stayed longer, but it was a no smoking facility and I wanted a damn cigarette. But at least there they treated me like a person.

Otherwise she falls asleep where she is, toilet, standing by the kitchen sink, or sitting at the table. This often causes her to fall on the floor, and she has hurt herself doing this.

The worst thing is, she is a smoker and has often fallen asleep with a lit cigarette.

She refuses to go lay down once she takes her pills because at that moment she isn't tired, but if she doesn't, she falls asleep suddenly at some point in time, and ends up sleeping in a non-bed location for hours, until she wakes around like 10am and actually goes to bed, then sleeps till like 6pm.

I often have to wake her up, but once those pills are in her, she doesn't want to move because she is too tired. She keeps falling back to sleep, often in dangerous areas like rolly chairs or on the toilet. Sometimes you have to tell her to wake up and go to bed several times before she finally does it. It's a battle, and she never remembers it in the morning. I never touch her or force her to bed, just verbally wake her up.

I have tried to get her to look into different medications but she refuses to because it took too long the first time to find these ones she says ""are right for her.""

I went to her therapist to speak my concerns about this and she told me that if I verbally try to wake my Mom more than once and ask her to go to bed, that I am commiting ""Elder Abuse.""

I personally feel that letting my Mom continue to burn things when falling asleep with a cigarette would be considered ""Elder Abuse,"" more than trying to wake her up.

Everything with this therapist is considered ""Elder Abuse,"" and she often tells my Mom to kick me out. I never abuse my Mother, I look after her and try to help her be the best she can be.

A few weeks ago my Niece was over for the first time and we were coloring and Mom was doing nothing. Mom loves to color so I suggested she join us, she said ""No."" I said ""Why not? You are just sitting there doing nothing, and you love to color, plus you haven't really spent any time with your granddaughter, I have been entertaining her all week, and her Dad, your Son, said she could not come back if she was bored.""

When I tried to discuss it with her, she flipped out.

She never wants to discuss problems and always runs away from discussions. She told her therapist that talking to me about the coloring made her want to ""run and hide,"" and her therapist told her that that meant it was ""Elder Abuse.""

Yesterday it was almost 6pm and she was still sleeping so I went to wake her up for dinner. I suggested she try finding a better sleeping schedule, and she yelled at me for ""Elder Abuse.""

I'm not abusing my mother! But that therapist keeps putting it into her head.

Note: she is also prescribed a sleeping pill, but she does not take it anymore because these medications already make her so sleepy.",13Apr2017,4
