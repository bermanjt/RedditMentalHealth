0,"Hi! This has been bothering me lately, I'll try to keep this short. 

I befriended this girl who's two years younger than me, we had a lot of the same interests and we got along pretty well. 

For the first four months of our friendship everything went pretty well, she started looking up to me like an older sister and listening to my advice. She's really, really impulsive and don't listen to her mom a lot. So I was a pretty good influence on her.

Once we got to the end of August, she started to change, she were going to a new school so that made sense I guess. 

So what's weird is she has a really good sense of making people feel comfortable enough to admit things, which is good and bad. I ended up accidentally coming out to her (I'm asexual) and admitting my anxiety. She was pretty accepting so it went pretty well.

After Halloween (I admitted to not ever being in a relationship after she ran into their ex who was my age) she got really weird. 

I went to her family's house for New Year's Eve and we all watched A New Hope (her family just went to see Rogue One right before) and some of her family's friends were over. 

This one kid who was about twelve started talking to me about funny Star Wars videos and was showing me a funny video when out of nowhere she (my friend) showed up and practically slapped the phone out of my hand and ripped the headphones off of my head and started cradling me and saying ""That video is inappropriate! She's innocent!! She can't watch that video!!"" 

I asked what was in it and she wouldn't say. I noticed at that time she also stopped asking me for advice after I admitted all those things to her. 

I just don't think our friendship is healthy. She has a ""lying voice"" and I know what it sounds like bc she uses it so much In front of her mom and the first time she ever said anything nice to me she used that fake voice.

I want to be there for her but when I'm around her I don't feel good about myself and when I spend more than a day with her I get really depressed and anxious. She's an attention seeker and puts herself out there like crazy so even if I'm cosplaying with her, even if mine looks better she'll always get the compliment. 

Most of my friends are on a similar level as I am so it isn't unfair when we go out. We always let eachother talk and have real conversations unlike when I go out with her she stares at me to talk because I guess she can't relate to me anymore but she won't listen to what I say. 

Oh and she has a bad habit of looking at my phone but if I look at her's she flips.

I just don't think it's good for my mental health. ",17Jan2017,1
1,"How can I help this?? Every noise is magnified and the littlest noises drive me into a full-blown panic. The repetitive ones, like smacking and chewing noises literally make me want to cut off my ears. I've had to cover/scratch my ears to get the tiniest bit of relief. How can I deal with this? I've heard that they make these hearing aid type devices that play low white noise to distract your ears from the sounds. When I talked to my psychiatrist about it, all she said was ""wow, you're overstimulated"" and just told me that my vyvanse would help it. It hasn't, at all. I constantly live with anger and anxiety because of the noises, voices, and sounds of the outside world. ",17Jan2017,2
3,"I have come to the conclusion that I need to see a psychologist for many bottled up, unresolved issues in my life that are slowly destroying me and my relationship with my SO.

I have seen a few psychologists earlier in life, but have never found a psych that I could actually connect with. This is extremely important to me, and I feel like ideally I want to meet and greet a few psychs before I choose one. Is such a thing even possible? I had the worst experience recently when I saw my GP and she recommended a psych to me. I booked an appointment with them, to which they informed me the earliest date she can see me is in 2 months, and we must also book a follow-up appointment in another month's time. She wouldn't let me speak and booked me in for a completely unsuitable hour during the working week. This conversation left me completely dishevelled and I felt like getting help was going to be more of a stress than any help. 
I guess what I'm looking for is more of a ""professional friend"". 

My last psychologist cost me 1/5 of my wage every week, and I couldn't not connect with him in the slightest. I'm an female Engineer on an average wage, with very high work expectations and at a stage in my professional life where I need to prove myself. (Picture small company, completely male dominated field) I can't leave work early once a week every week, and I definitely do not plan on alerting my employer to my mental weaknesses. 

Does anyone have any advice for me on this dilemma? Any personal experiences I could bounce ideas off?",17Jan2017,3
6,"Diagnosed major depressive disorder, 30 years old male who just started to live alone 7 hours away from family for a job opportunity. Take medications and had ECT performed.

Also recovering from a breakup with a person I loved very much and thought I'd spend my life with. The breakup happened in the town I moved from.

I don't know anybody in the new town and really didn't want to come because I get lonley very fast and need lots of emotional support. I need constant contact with people who I love. 

Acquaintances and friends and social contact of a leisure nature don't give me that warm blanket feeling I need to feel normal. 

My parents and my ex and my brother and my best friend have me warmth to not feel so cold and lonley.

I've been here alone in my apartment for one day and I already thought about hurting myself twice. 

The normal advice is to reach out to people and join groups etc.

But without the love and hugs of my parents and ex and my family support I get very sad and I want to just go into a shell and avoid everyone. That deep pain makes it so hard to talk to people.

7,"Because I see so much (realistic) concern about expense in these posts, I feel obligated to make it clear that modern psychotherapy is no longer necessarily about $150-an-hour, one-on-one ""counseling."" In fact *most* modern PT is about much more efficient, outpatient skills training and homework in small study group settings. It's more like going to school for one or two class sessions a week, often in the evening. 

To find the sort of clinicians and clinics that provide such services, look [here](https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/), and [here]( http://doctor.webmd.com/find-a-doctor/specialty/psychiatry), and [here](https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/), and (for DBT specialists in particular) [here](http://behavioraltech.org/resources/crd.cfm). If you dig a little on each page, you will be able to see which therapies they use and how they deliver them. Then interview *them* as though they were applying for a job with *your* company. Most MD / psychiatrists, btw, are *not* therapists themselves (they are medication specialists), but can refer you to those who are, and are often -- though not always -- excellent sources of referral. 

Moreover, there's a lot of good skills training online now at little or even no charge. The [10 StEPs of Emotion Processing](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+of+Emotion+Processing) is a good example. 

Finally, a lot can be accomplished using inexpensive workbooks like [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=stanley+block+mind+body+bridging+therapy+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=CBT+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=ACT+therapy+workbooks), and [these](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=DBT+therapy+workbooks).

11,"So I've had an internal struggle for a while and although it doesn't happen as often as it used to, I find myself time and time again being crippled by it and each time it is just as painful. I constantly try to repress these feelings that seem to result mainly from social anxiety. It just puts me in a rut, and makes me feel depressed on various levels depending on the embarrassment of the situation. I have never gotten help for it because I was usually able to feel like myself again after a day or two. Which is usually dependent on my interactions with people. As I type, I'm actually recovering from a rut right now which has started around last night. That's how quickly I can bounce back from it sometimes, which makes it feel unnecessary to find help. But it still gets triggered one way or another down the line. And I want to know how you guys feel about it.

As mentioned, they are mostly always triggered by social interaction. A common instance in my past would involve social situations in which all I wanted to do was get out of them because I wasn't feeling like myself. Sometimes I don't even know the reason as to why I feel that way and it almost seems like it's dependent on my wellbeing or my immediate past reactions. When I don't feel like myself, I usually experience neck aches, trying to make unnatural conversation (trying to be my happy normal self when I'm not), my brain doesn't function alertly and I feel like I have to make people repeat themselves when I normally wouldn't because I'm lacking concentration in the interaction and more on not feeling like myself, and I cannot think straight. Afterwards, knowing that if people may know I am not being myself, that's where my embarrassment begins. Thinking about my embarrassment can get me pretty depressed-feeling. Is this social anxiety?? It's weird because almost 90% of the time I feel like my normal self: happy, sociable, and upbeat. In fact, this happened on a daily basis when during the last half of high school.

To give a bit of background, what triggered this feeling was when 2 of my closest friends moved high schools. The weird thing is- is that my social anxiety didn't even happen right after they moved, and actually happened a year after. I just couldn't find the same fulfillment in my current high school friends, I didn't know how to be myself anymore. I felt like I was acting to be happy every single day. Another weird thing- I still hung out with my friends who moved away and still couldn't find ways to feel completely myself. Things got better when I started dating someone in high school- even though I was still mildly depressed. Knowing that someone was interested helped with boosting my confidence. I wanted a fresh new start in college. My first year was tough: I shyed away from many people, and mostly found comfort and fulfillment with my boyfriend at the time, and alcohol because it made me feel good in social situations. I refrained from hanging out with certain people because I know I would feel uncomfortable for not feeling like myself. My 2nd year came around, and things got better. I met a lot of new people and started feeling comfortable with the people I met the year before, even though feelings of anxiety and depression were still there. I started hanging out with the people again and starting feeling like myself again with having a solid group of friends. My 3rd and 4th year in college were the best years in terms of my social anxiety and feelings of depression. I felt like myself, I felt true enjoyment in the people around me. I was talkative, friendly, natural, and sociable. I would still have my 'episodes'- but they are minimal just like they are now.

Over the years, my social anxiety has gradually diminished and although the duration of each time I get depressed or anxious lasts a shorter time because I know how to be myself again, it mentally hurts me the same each time- depending on the embarrassment I feel from my social interactions. It is obvious now that I am confident in my own personality again. However, more recently I have started developing a higher lack of self-confidence in my thought processes and explanations to other people. I was never really one to explain things as articulately and as well as others. At the work place, this has posed a big problem. During meetings, I am constantly afraid to participate because of my fear of not being able to get my point across in an articulate manner (I also have a major fear of public speaking). Even with my friends, if I am being expected to explain something I feel that pressure again that causes my heart to pump fast. I am usually able to get my point across quickly, but there have been times where I couldn't think of the right thing to say at the moment and run into so much pressure that my train of thought just escapes, and I have to say something to help play it off-- sometimes coming out choppy and going in tangents aside from the point. I am not even nervous around my friends; for some reason, the questions that get my heart pumping the most usually now revolve around me explaining about my current or past work. I feel a slight uncomfortable tingling in my head when this happens, I start to sweat, and I feel the embarrassment coming back. This time, I don't feel uncomfortable from not knowing how to be myself, but from the thought of being unable to explain something. Again, is this social anxiety? When my social anxiety kicks in and is noticeable, I get so embarrassed again and fall into a rut of depression. I also noticed that when my head isn't fully clear on days that follow medium to heavy alcohol consumption, this type of social anxiety is triggered even easier even though I am not hungover. The day-after feeling of alcohol consumption are bad sometimes, feeling down, not myself, and imagining random and bad scenarios in my head, sometimes following bad dreams. I don't want to make this a complete issue on alcohol cause I've felt anxious/depressed before I started drinking, but it has played a factor that has worsened my condition on days after I drink.

So yes, I don't know if 'social anxiety' or 'depression' are the right terms to use. But if you relate to any of this, or can help me on identifying what's going on with me, it would be greatly appreciated. It has taken me until now to finally come out and accept that I may have anxiety and depression... but I am doing this in hopes to finally help relieve myself on these ruts that I feel and to finally get solutions.",17Jan2017,5

22,"How can I see the choices better made?

Where do they all go?

If fate, life, is a series of paths winding and unwinding, veering off by the decisions we make, why then, if those paths are wrought, can we not see them?

He who said hindsight can be viewed with perfect acuity is a treacherous liar!


We see into our choices most often only the cost at which they were made, or the gains by which we achieve by taking said action. However, we never truly know the fullness, breadth or length of the path we did not take.

Who is to say that we have made the right decisions, or the wrong ones? 

We can only base it on what we know of the result.

The result is made clear as it is the time and reality in which we are present.

But had we taken another turn, spoken another word, held back, moved forward, done anything apart from what it was that brought us to today, where would we be and what could we have seen?

Where do those futures go?


A path through the woods still exists whether we take it or not. It does not cease to be simply because we walk in another direction. Therefore, does it not stand to reason that as one possible outcome plays out, another continues, unbeknownst to us, winding through the trees out of sight? 

Where do those futures go?


Would they not still exist?

Perhaps one reality does not afford to the awareness of others, but there must be others. 

How else could the decisions we make play out the way that they do, unless there is a path for it to do so? In which case there must be another beyond our field of vision in which alternative outcomes play out.

They must still exist.

How can we see them?

Where do those futures go?

25,"First I would like to apologize for this post beeing chaotic and not so good English.

I think I will start from the end. Today I had (Or rather I still have, otherwise I wouldn't be writing this) a mental breakdown. I've cried until I had no tears. Looking back I think this collapse was unavoidable. The straw that broke the camel's back was me realizing I won't finish my Engineering Thesis in time to start masters right away. That means I will have to wait half a year for external studies or a year for full-time. That's not how I imagined it. My parent's know. They took that quite well, without anger or shouting.

The reason for my failure is twofold. First my subject turned out to be more advanced and problematic than I thought. Second is lazinnes. Everyone is lazy you may say but my case is a bit different. You see, I don't have problems with working hard, I was receiving scholarship for being in top 10% best students. The problem arises when deadline in far away. I can't motivate myself and end up miraculously finishing things on last day or not as in the current case. I don't know if there is mental illness category for this but it has one property that is key for many classifications and that is it influences my normal life.

My social skills are pure mess. I've never had any social life. I've never had any friends. I'm not counting classmates as they aren't real friends. No friends means no social life, no social life means no friends - dead end. On the other hand I've never had any problems with playing with other kids or with talking during/after school. I was bullied a bit in my teens but nothing serious enough to be scared of going to school or skipping it. I've never a had a girlfriend and I'm a virgin. I had trouble with official situations since primary school. Getting some paper from office was a nightmare. I've started developing some adaptation recently. Like trying to apply the same scheme: go in -&gt; greet -&gt; say what I want -&gt; hope it goes well. Same applies to meeting someone on the street - I just try to answer with some nonsense to at least to not look rude.

I have noone to talk to. My parents are supportive, helpful and understanding but I don't feel like talking to them about my problems. I don't know if it's my fault or their but at some point I stopped telling them about my problems. Maybe because they were a bit strict (when I was 20 yo I still had a rule about going to bed at certain time). Or maybe because I've never had any rebel episodes to show them I'm another human. I don't know.
I don't know how to describe my emotional state/character. I was always shy even too shy. A few years ago I was getting furious very easily over anything. About 2 years ago It somehow changed to the complete opposition and I can't get angry no matter what. The most intense anger I can feel is strong frustration if something annoys me over and over again. I like it and I hate it. I like the feeling of control but conserving feelings inside can be tiresome. Some people say that cursing is a way to deal with bad emotions. I've never cursed, that's how I was raised and I don't feel like changing it.

And here comes stress. I'm stressing way too much and way too often. The pattern is somewhat strange. I stress out lightly (and constantly) over things I'm currently doing and it goes away quite easily as I move to other things, not so much about close future and a lot about distant future. Sometimes if I don't do anything engaging my mind starts thinking about all possible problems and difficulties I may encounter in the future. At 2nd year on university instead of worrying about exams I started to worry if I get a good job and what they may ask me during inteview. I don't know how to stop it. I've got myself addicted to masturbation (not porn if that matters) as a way to relieve stress.

If you're curious I've never wanted to commit suicide. Actually death rather scares me. I don't know which end of the stick is worse.

Now I'm completly shattered, questioning everything and trying to find some goal in life but I can't find any that really matters. I'm trying to leave past behind and look into the future (That sounds stupid but it's more or less how it feels) but I'm getting anxiety instead of hope.

I should finish my thesis as soon as possible but I can't focus. The pressure is that if I finish it within a month time I won't have any problems with my current degree. I don't even mention comparing myself with others (or do I right here?)

Thanks if you read it all.


//EDIT

Some more things I forgot to mention. 

I always try to do things ""properly"". Most of the time it means that I need more time than others to finish something. Sometimes I can't focus on the main task and do smaller things that I can fully comprehend. It connects to the not finishing things in time thing and produces more stress.

I also have a very strong aversion to trying new things. First I think that maybe I should do something new, then I push it away by thinking it doesn't really matter and doing daily mundane activities. And some time after I feel guilty that if I've done that, I would be in better situation. Especially when I see someone else who succeeded. 

It also has second layer, I'm feeling it even as I'm writing this. I fear that nothing will change. It's a cycle. Feeling guilty of not doing something -&gt; motivation -&gt; does it even matter / whatever / I'm fooling myself I can do anything (somewhere here right now) -&gt; forget it / normal life -&gt; back to guilty.

Oh and I also feel guilty for thinking that something may be wrong with me and I'm not just a shitty person not being able to solve his problems.",17Jan2017,3
29,"Are defense mechanisms optional? I notice that I am using them sometimes, mainly intellectualization. Can I choose not to use them? What happens then?",17Jan2017,2
30,"I'm looking for someone to point me in the right direction here as I'm quite unsure where to turn. I need to speak to someone about my mental health in general but I'm worried I'll receive improper advice or that my case won't be taken seriously. I think my problems are fairly serious but I have a tendency to down-play these things when explaining them verbally, constantly reminding myself that a lot of other people are way, way worse off than I am.

This may be a bit of a rant / essay but it's the only way I feel I can really explain it. I don't really have anyone in real life who I'd feel comfortable talking to about these things so it would be nice to get it off my chest if anyone would care to read... There's a TLDR at the bottom.

I'm nearly 27 years old and I'm worried I may have a social anxiety disorder which won't get better on its own. I've had trouble with dating and social situations in general for as long as I can remember. When I'm with people I trust and feel comfortable around I'm fairly 'normal' and reasonably confident but in situations where I'm forced to interact with new people, or if I feel out of my comfort zone, I can just crumble. Sometimes I can't get my words out and my mouth dries up when I'm under pressure - it's embarrassing, especially at work. I'm good at my job in general but I fear my clearly low self-esteem and lack of confidence in situations where I have to interact with other people and think on my feet makes me appear inept and immature. I feel like the problem is getting worse and worse when I should really have learnt how to improve on my flaws and start developing as a person by this age. 

Several different people who know me quite well have told me they thought I was an absolute 'weirdo' when they first met me, but absolutely love me having got to know me. I want to learn how to be myself without hesitation, and how to love myself. I want to be the best version of 'me' that I can, all of the time... I want to always be the funny, confident, lovable person I can only seem to be when I'm around the people I know well.

It's strange, some days I'll walk around, doing my day to day without a care in the world, feeling fairly content with life and I'll be perfectly happy to interact with strangers and other days I'll be way down in the dumps, irritable and afraid of interaction... often for reasons I can't explain. 

I think the majority of my issues are largely a result of (mainly verbal / psychological) bullying experienced during my ""formative years"". A problem which has just spiralled further and further out of control as the years have gone by. I've actually blanked the majority of ages 14 - 17 out of my memory. I was part of a pretty large social circle in my teens; I spent a lot of time with around 20 / 30 kids who were nice as pie to me in groups of around 4 - 5, but in groups any larger than that, the majority of them would just turn on me, constantly teasing and tormenting me... humiliating me in front of everyone else over and over and over. I was the brunt of every joke. It was confusing as I was convinced these people were my friends. Some were much worse than others. I can't really recall many specific details though, like I say, there's just a sort of black hole in my memory... but I can tell you that kids can be very, very cruel.

I shouldn't have these issues and I don't think I truly deserve to feel like this. I have a lot to be happy about; I have a good job, I drive a nice car, I live alone and support myself in a nice place which I own, I've worked for all of this and feel like I should be proud of myself... physically I know I'm not a bad looking guy at all, but deep down I feel like the least attractive person on the planet (and it really, really shows). I keep uttering the words ""I hate myself"" over and over again in my head, occasionally out loud. Something's really eating me up and I can't quite put my finger on exactly what it is.

I'm curious to know whether or not I'm on the Autistic Spectrum and whether or not the above issues are related. I've taken several online tests/quizzes for autism (some a couple of years ago and some very recently) - my results are usually somewhere around 70-80% mark. I understand this is simply a guideline and by no means an official diagnosis. 

I don't know if this ties in with Autism but there are certain traits I can recall from early child hood, such as making uncontrollable grunting/squeaking noises. I used to be obsessed with each grunt or squeak being a higher / lower pitch than the last. My parents never had this checked out, as I recall the problem just sort of went away on its own, although to this day I still feel a very slight urge to do it at times. Also, from around age 17, I started to become very, very tidy. I wouldn't say I was quite up there with people who have extreme cases of OCD, e.g. I'm not hoovering under the couch at 4 in the morning, but I don't feel content unless everything is clean and in its right place. I haven't always been like this - I was a very, very messy teenager up to around this time.

When I was in school, I had trouble concentrating and lacked drive. I was placed in several classes for children with ""special needs"". I was never assessed or diagnosed with any specific condition, just told that I had ""special needs"". I detested school and everything about it. The social system, the uniforms, a lot (but not all) of the people who called themselves ""teachers""... the list goes on. I only really started to get myself into gear at the age of 17 when I pushed myself to go to college and resit my GCSE exams (strangely, I thoroughly enjoyed college and did really well in my exams). 


My worry is this:

TLDR

I work for the National Health Service. I look after computers / printers etc for several hundred GP surgeries, including the one I am a registered patient at. I could be talking about my mental health issues to my GP one day and unjamming his printer the next and I don't know if I could cope with that. My best guess is that if I do discuss this with my GP, I'll be referred to a CBT Therapist. Chances are I'll be referred to the building where the mental health staff whose computers and printers I also support are based!!

I've already been to CBT once - I was hit by a drunk driver a few years ago and suffered a head injury (nothing horribly serious but still pretty bad). CBT was part of the rehabilitation. The GP who referred me to CBT also prescribed anti-depressants. I can't remember what sort they were but I do remember researching them and discovering that they were extremely addictive and potentially life changing with varied negative side effects. I was astounded a GP would prescribe something like this based on a 20 / 30 min or so appointment with a patient, but there you go. I never took the anti-depressants. 

When I attended CBT, I think it worked a bit, but I think I needed longer. And I actually enjoyed it as I find psychology fascinating anyway. One of my worries is that a girl I was dating very briefly screwed with my head a little bit a few years ago... and she just happens to be a CBT therapist... she was on the rebound after breaking up with her ex and well... you get it. I remember thinking she was one of the most mentally unstable people I'd spoken to in a while... so I'm just not sure I can trust the system. And imagine if I were referred to her as a patient?!


Can anyone tell me if speaking to my GP is definitely the best place to start here? I don't like what's happening to me and I think it's about time I said enough is enough and reached out for help - I'm struggling to get through this by myself but I don't want to make things worse unnecessarily.

* I can create a safe space in my car or my closet if I really need to. 
* I will make sure my safe space is clean and calming, not messy and chaotic.

Making my S/O understand my mental state, and that it has nothing to do with him

* Not sure he is open to talking about this yet, I will be patient as I have no control over him

Getting less angry over obstacles and not blaming myself or others

* I will not shift blame of my problems on other people; I will help myself if no help is available

Stop eating as much food

* I will not eat an excess amount of food
* I will not eat when I am feeling stressed or having negative thoughts
* I will not use food as a distraction from negative emotions
* I will stop eating entire pizzas
* I will run for at least 30 minutes tonight on the treadmill

Spending more time doing things that have a positive impact on my mood

* I will take a professional photo of one of the dogs tonight
* I will get back to configuring the software I am paying for
* I will do my laundry (and put it away)
* I will blow dry my hair

35,"I think of suicide every minute. I have a detailed roadmap for my suicide; how to do it, where to do it, what to do before hand. The whole lot is scripted from A to Z.

The thing is, while I have this plan, I never intended to go through with it until my mother passes away. She cares too much about me. But I am starting to question that intention. I think that a day will come soon where I take my life premature to when I intend to.

I have had this suicide plan for many, many years now, but only recently have I begun to work out the finer logistics of it. I plan on killing myself by sitting on a traintrack and waiting. I have found a good area of track where primarily passenger trains go (the fastest ones) with low visibility on the area. Some days after work I will drive near the area I intend to do it and spend a good half an hour watching a few trains go by before heading home. It doesn't scare me, and I look forward to the day when everything will finally be over.

I am mentally prepared to kill myself, and I have made it as easy as possible to actually do.

How can I get medical help for this? I accept that I will kill myself; I just do not want to die now. While I have no reason to live, I have one remaining reason to not die. I do not know how long my mum will live, but as horrible as this sounds, she will probably live too long.

I have no one to talk to. I have no friends or family except my mother, and I would not dare burden her with the thought of her only son feeling this way.

Medication has not helped me. The short time I spent in therapy did not help me, either.

I called up 111 (urgent yet non-emergency medical helpline) and all they did was say I need to see my GP. I explained that I felt too scared to see anyone and they told me that if I did not want to see my GP, that I should instead book myself into a mental ward. Both of which scare me more than ending my life and putting my mum under that grief.

The attraction I find in being dead is starting to outweigh the need for my mum to be happy as possible. So what am I meant to do? I am too scared to talk to someone, and medication doesn't help me.

Am I just fucked? Am I just gonna have to try to tough this out and hope that I can outlive her?

Thanks",17Jan2017,3
40,"Before anyone asks, I have no intention at all to hurt myself not others of course.

I'm just carrying a lot of pain and although my mind is clear to an extent, my heart is not and that hurts a lot. I find I blame myself for too much and always devalue myself alike.

I've grown up putting others first and now that mindset is coming back to bite me.

Yet, I don't know how to go about improving this and pushing through it as a whole. I want to add more detail, I really do, but I can't get my head straight right now. So I suppose I'll have to make another post later or add detail in the comment section.

I'm simply confused and in pain. :(",17Jan2017,1
42,"Reddit, I have had a rough couple of months. My doctor put me on a very low dose of Wellbutrin and adovan for night time to help. 

I am taking it as prescribed, but soon enough the Wellbutrin wears off, like 4pm or so, and I feel wracked with withdrawal symptoms, my body craves it so bad. It used to be morning only, and then this horrible jonesing thing kicked in afternoons. and I tried to say 'no', I don't want to take it anymore. He just increased it to afternoons too. So evenings are like this until I take the adovan, really. They haven't answered my calls, - I think I sound too crazy. I have no social support so no one to ask for for help otherwise. My dad wouldn't know what to do. My mother might, but she's a narcissist and I don't know if it's worth the cost I'll pay later down the line if I ask her for help. Siblings, one doesn't contact me at all and the other will ignore me if I ask for help. I don't have any friends. 

I am trying to pretend normal, but every night I am eating fancy cheese at best and drinking and/or getting high at worst to ease this. I tried to take myself off of them before but did it too quick - my head felt squeezed. Feeling a little more above the line during the day, don't think it's worth this pummeling every night. Plus I think my memory is worse on it too. Hoping for anything to help.",17Jan2017,1
43,"The anxiety if I remember something that could change her opinion of me and I don't tell her is so overwhelming I literally cannot focus on anything else. It's overwhelming and it kills me. It could be like I remembered something I did 6 years ago looong before I knew her but if I think there's even a slight chance of her looking at me differently because of it, I freak the fuck out until I tell her. It's killing me. I can't keep any type of secret from her even if it has nothing to do with who I am now or something. I don't know why I'm like this and it's so frustrating. It causes problems because I become completely consumed by this anxiety. If I spill my guts I'm fine for a bit and my brain automatically looks for the next thing to freak out about. 

Sorry for the wall of text or if this is the wrong sub.",17Jan2017,2
44,"I just wondered if anyone knows what I'm experiencing -if it points to anything specific that I can research effective ways of coping. I first experienced this phenomenon when I would abuse MDMA and other stimulants during the 'comedown' I would get intense paranoia and extreme discomfort at being around people to the point where I would feel trapped, paralysed and terrified that people around me would know I couldn't cope and I would just generally have some sort of melt down. To escape this I used to drink and leave as soon as possible, sometimes before the comedown took a hold.

That was when I was 14-16 (the stimulants) but very regularly (1-2times per week I would get high off them) These days (over a decade later) I don't use any drugs or alcohol at all but from time to time (very rarely now) I get similar symptoms - feel trapped, like people can read my mind, will ask me what's wrong and ill melt down. Same mental paralysis. It's a difficult sensation to describe but it's extremely distressing. It always arises in situations where I feel social.pressures and it isn't easy for me to.leave such as work or formal social gatherings. It's like I get trapped in my head. Like I need a safeword for life! Please how can I manage these times? Thanks y are extremely distressing. I don't feel like I could say anything to anyone at the time because it is that intense. Could it be damage I did to my developing brain with lots of drugs? Thanks for your time.",17Jan2017,2
45,"What my bipolar feels like. 

I visualize my bipolar depression as a dark hole. The deepness varies depending on the depth of the depression. I imagine seeing light at the top, and being able to climb part of the way out only to slide back down to the bottom time after time. After a while, I get used to the darkness. I let it wrap itself around me and even crawl into my head. It becomes all I can see and feel. It feels like it becomes me, and starts acting for me.

My mania feels like a rollercoaster that's going off the tracks. Sometimes it's thrilling and everything seems fine and great, and other times everything seems out of control, and like I'm stuck speeding down a course to destruction. In both instances, I keep doing whatever I'm doing until it all catches up with me, and I'm confronted with the reality of my situation and the consequences of my actions. When it ends, it ends with a bang. Life crumbles all around me, and the cycle back to depression begins. 

Thankfully I've been learning about how to cope with it all, and with hard work and medication, I can hopefully get to a place where I can keep myself leveled out so I can focus on living my life. ",17Jan2017,3
