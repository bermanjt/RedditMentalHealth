0,"Hi, I'm 16 years old and currently live in the U.K. I would like to see a doctor about some mental health issues I've been experiencing but I'm deathly scared of doing so. 

First of all, is it okay to go on my own at 16? And would it be okay to bring along my boyfriend of three years to explain the issues as I don't feel comfortable explaining myself? I recently saw a doctor five months ago with my mom about my anxiety, I wanted to talk about other things but I don't feel comfortable opening up while my mom is there. She basically just told me I'd be fine and left me, telling me to talk to my school counsellor if I needed to, and so I did. The school counsellor saw me once and then forgot about me, this has made me feel like I'm wasting everybody's time/ I'm looking for attention. I cannot gain the courage to actually see a doctor and I am petrified of the idea of therapy. Not only this but I live with my grandparents that don't think mental health issues exist and constantly tell me I'm too young to have any problems. My boyfriend however is very understanding and sees me almost everyday, I don't really want to go into the actually issues I deal with but that's pretty much it. I guess what I'm asking is for validation, is it okay to see a doctor? Or am I wasting their time? I honestly don't feel like seeking help because of what happened last time and I feel like I look like I'm seeking for attention when honestly I just want to be able to function like a normal human being, I have my final GCSE exams very soon and I just want to be at least somewhat mentally stable to have a chance of getting good grades for my future. 

Thank you for reading if you got this far, if you have any advice for me all would be appreciated.

Also, I don't really know what to say to the doctor, I'm really awkward and struggle to even form sentences properly when speaking to other people, I really don't what to come across as a bother to anybody/ seem like I'm exaggerating.",09Dec2017,1

6,"Okay so sometimes I will see something on tv, i'll give you an example. Home Alone, the movie and I get this surge of anxiety and a panic attack because it's like i'm flashed back to the Christmas where I got sick and threw up all night. (I have a SEVERE fear of vomiting) I also have that it's winter and it gets darker earlier and the days are shorter and it triggers me into remembering (I went through a bad period back in 2002 during December - February) all the doctors and therapists I saw when I was 7 (when I was diagnosed with OCD)-12 and one hospital stay when I wouldn't eat or sleep and was having constant anxiety. Like when I see that movie or something associated with a horrible tramatizing moment in my life like that I go into a instant panic. It's not now its over. I don't understand. My dad took me at that moment and I remember being in the waiting room feeling so much anxiety and thinking I was dying. I also have trouble when I get anxious around my dad because he was there when I went through it and I associate my dad with anxiety? I feel horrible because he's my dad. I try to calm myself down and tell myself that that was then this is now and try to come back to the moment but it repeats in my head and the anxiety gets so bad I dry heave and almost lose it. Is this PTSD? Or a form of it? I remember all the mental health stuff over a decade ago being scary as hell for a 8 year old and it scared me to not know what I was feeling and the anxiety and the symptoms. Did it traumatize me? I don't fully understand and how do I over come this?",09Dec2017,1

13,"I’m having a hard time dealing with my depression &amp; anxiety, and yesterday I ended up not going into work due to it.   I’ve suffered a lot with working, I’ve worked numerous places and the last job I had to leave because of my mental health.   

Basically yesterday, my boyfriend had taken the keys to our house, (we only have one) I had to wake up my stepdad for his keys (he works nights &amp; has only been asleep for a few hours, so that made me feel super bad about waking him up)  Then before I left, I could feel this horrible feeling bubbling up, but I was trying to go on &amp; just get to work. However, unfortunately due to my panic, I almost got hit by a car, which beeped very loudly and really actually scared me which pushed me over the edge, I was in full blown panic next to the road, plus no way of getting back inside my house due to pushing my stepdads keys back through the letter box.   

Luckily I had my sister to come and get me, during this time I had rung up work to say I was going to be a bit late due to needing to calm down.  My initial thought was I was going to go in later, however when receiving a phone call from my manager who’s first started the conversation with ‘we’re short staffed today, it’s Christmas peak time!’ I couldn’t face it, going to work especially after her tone, I felt guilty and embarrassed all at once but mentally I just couldn’t do it, I felt bad as well when my manager decided to tell me about ‘everyone has these mornings, Carl got sick on him from his children the other morning and he was still here!’ 

My manager is annoyed because I have taken more than 3 sick days within a certain time frame, but i feel everything crashing around me mentally during the phone call, I was sobbing and rambling down the phone about ‘I just couldn’t do it, I’m sorry’   

I just feel like I’m doing well then I get pulled back down, and I’m struggling trying to keep my head up. I feel so hopeless about work, is it just going back into another cycle of quitting &amp; then finding a new job before it all turns sour again? I’ve got so many things I want to do but mentally, I feel like work days are so hard. How can I get anywhere if I can’t even get up for work? I just feel like I’m mentally stuck in limbo.  I’m writing this before my shift at work today, before my welfare meeting I’m dreading.   


One of the reasons I’ve struggled with welfare meetings is because, I’ve moved back to my mums up north &amp; haven’t signed up for the Doctors here so I haven’t had any appointments. However with work, I was off and panicked when my manager asked me if I had seen a doctor, and instead of saying ‘no I forgot to put in my application’ I lied and said yes, I was scared I would get fired for not seeing a doctor, as it comes down to not helping myself with work and could lead to me leaving work &amp; without money to pay for bills or live.  


I’m trying my hardest &amp; things are going well however, I feel like I’m struggling to breathe. I’ve got so many things I want to do with my life, but I just feel like I can barely get myself up for work &amp; I’ll never achieve anything. I just don’t know what to anymore, I’m scared of going to work and scared of not going, I don’t know how to make everything better. I feel like nothing is ever going to change, and I’ll be stuck in this limbo forever.   

Thanks for listening!",09Dec2017,1
14,"Full disclosure: I think it's crap.

Let me clarify. I think there are seeds of truth within it. I was relentlessly bullied and somewhat abused as a child, and had to conscientiously re-train myself to overcome severe social anxiety and, to a lesser extent, OCD tendencies. It took a lot of effort and cost me about ten of the most important socially-formative years of my life (plus all that childhood nostalgia which I don't have). I'm still a bit ""weird"" in many ways, but in a pinch I can pass for someone who's highly sociable and charismatic, and even enjoy it from time to time!

However, being introduced to CBT many years later, it feels rather like a half-baked caricature of what I went through, both in terms of the problem and its solution. [Here's](http://www.theemotionmachine.com/cognitive-restructuring-complete-guide-reframe-beliefs/) a decent overview of what CBT represents and [Here's](http://www.specialtybehavioralhealth.com/wp-content/Common%20Unhealthy%20Thought%20Patterns.pdf) a list of ""common unhealthy thought patterns"".

*****

So the basic premise of CBT is that ""distorted thoughts"" are the root of mental illness, and it's further assumed that these thoughts take the form of an explicit internal narrative, like, ""*I failed; I'll always be a failure, and no-one will ever like me.*""

I call bullshit. Yes, these thoughts may occasionally happen, but for me they're, like, 10% of the experience. I'd guess they probably make up a good amount of what therapists hear in dealing with patients in distress because, *duh*—

—In general you're not going to get a lot of carefully-measured analyses from these people about their experience. Not when they're at their most desperate, and likely in an unfamiliar, uncomfortable environment (which therapy often is). THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THIS IS THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM. It's a fucking symptom.

And that brings me onto my next gripe with CBT, which is that it's inherently a victim-blaming sort of philosophy.  One thing I noticed about the above-linked ""list of cognitive distortions"" is that it doesn't really correspond to any list of objective logical fallacies; it's something that can pretty much be applied to ANYONE who complains about anything. It's *super* easy for a therapist to find and label ""cognitive distortions"" in their patients, without needing to do any more work or provide any other insight.

Seriously, I suspect that this is probably the biggest reason why CBT is so popular—it's so very easy to deploy.

*****

But I digress. The biggest problem, I find, is that CBT simply doesn't cover very much of the experience. I've written extensively about ADHD and depression in the past. For one thing, there's the existential angst that comes from not being able to rely on satisfaction from doing ""good"" things—I can absolutely have a good workout, then meet a friend for coffee, and feel fucking *terrible* afterwards, meaning that it's a constant struggle to even keep that baseline going. I find both my curiosity and empathy waning, and have to consciously address each of them in turn to try to ""build myself up"" to a point where I feel somewhat engaged. I've been doing it for YEARS.",09Dec2017,1

Shadows lurking under the door

What are they standing there for?

All they're doing is taunting me

Why can't they just let me be?

People whisper on the street

They know the secrets that I keep

They glance and laugh behind my back

About the confidence that I lack

Cameras searching everywhere 

Hidden away but always there

Tracking down my every mistake

I know exactly what's at stake 

People plotting all around

Finding ways to take me down 

To torture, harm, and kill

That's why they hunt me still

I feel they're all against me

The people that I can't see

Why do I feel this way?

How can I get away

From something that isn't even real?

Just a delusion that I feel

oh, but it haunts me so

I just want to let it go

But the shadows are lurking under my door

16,"I'm pretty much a procrastinator, unless i'm already on the way of action.  I have ocd.

Do i like going out? i do! it gets fun most of the times, even if i'm really uuuehh about going at first. But it's not the same for drawing or makeup videos.

I love drawing, it's my life. But there are times i'm too lazy to do it, but i'm actually excited about starting it. The paper and pencil just don't seem to come by themselves.  There are times i also want to draw but i'm just lazy with the pen. Gets dissapointing.

Do i like makeup and fashion? i do! but waiting for the girl or boy to get to the final product , important explanation and details gets annoying. Just tell me how to do it already!!

It also seems to happen with runway shows. Certain shows are great! and I love certain model walks, but i also wanna watch every outfit. So sometimes i put it in a faster speed. I just wanna see those beautiful outfits already, to appreciate them and for inspiration! especially if it's a really long show.

Also seems to happen with shows in general!
For example, i LOOOVED the first season of stranger things, and i wanna see the second season. But i have to do a schedule to watch it.. because i'd probably be like ''weh'' about starting netflix and dedicating myself to it, even though i want to.

Happens with friends too. I have to get myself motivated to talk. Come on, it'll be fun.

I think if i didn't get myself together to do anything, i'd probably lay in bed and die. For real.

I don't know if it has something to do with my illness, or i'm just an extremely lazy person. But anyways, i wonder if somebody else feels like this.

17,"I was diagnosed with schizophrenia about two years ago, and while talking with my old primary care provider a few months ago I told him (in a very serious tone) that I thought that the government was torturing me. He asked me who I thought was doing it, and I said the CIA.

His response verbatim was (in a very serious tone): ""The CIA can't have its soldiers fearing death."" He was not joking around with me. He said it with a straight face and just stared at me for a moment afterwards.

At the time this made sense to me because I thought that he was ""in on it."" It also really served to confirm my beliefs. I just remembered it and it struck me as kind of abusive; he knew that I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and was/am actively taking antipsychotics for it. Your doctor (especially your primary care provider) should be someone you can rely on. I know he isn't a psychiatrist, but come on.

I don't think I'm going to report him for this, but wanted to know if I could and if I should. He's private practice, so I don't know if there's even anything that can be done.

I want to add that this wasn't the first sketchy thing he said, and that I only saw him 4-5 times before moving again.

Also, I should include that I didn't respond to him in case someone inevitably asks what my response was. I just sat there silently and watched him stare at me for a moment before he changed the topic.",09Dec2017,1

19,"Hi,
I dont really know where to put this post, but I feel like it is somewhat DP related. So it seems like either I push through or believe my mind which flipped over 4 months ago. I seriously feel like since this has started that Ive been destined to suicide.
So my mind is so unbelievably destructive and I am severely depressed, not that I dont want to do anything, rather cant imagine doing anything with these thoughts, more like intrusive feelings based on false beliefs.
Basically I recovered from DPDR this year, everything is as it used to be except for my mind. It is so worn out because the 6 months of DP were too much I guess. It is so worn out that I could convince myself that I died when DP hit me in February. There is nothing worse than no symptoms but still irrational thinking. It recently hit me with massive bouts of hopelessness and suicidal thoughts. It feels like I shouldnt be here anymore.
4 months ago I thought suicide was an absurd thing (for me) and even during DP suicide didnt even cross my mind one single time. But now it feels like my worst imaginations came true and it is just pure mental pain.
Everything about future is triggering the hell out of me, I cant picture myself in the future anymore without thinking (maybe I might have killed myself by then?!), it is so difficult to even hold the place at university, but Ive already decided that I'd drop out.
It all changed in July where I had ups and downs but in the beginning of August these intrusive bouts of suicidal thoughts (like I hit a threshold and the only way out would be suicide, because it felt so terribly painful, like I was destined to suicide) hit me out of the blue and I suddenly became paranoid of time and future... It is not that I dont want to live anymore but my mind doesnt. It is strange...:( So basically it felt like my mind decided: your life is over now. This feeling freaked me out and days have been a struggle since then because it seriously felt like there is no way out but suicide. Since August everything triggers the feeling that I should be dead, even my hobby: drumming, music.
Biggest trigger: sounds hilarious, but it is the date. It seems like I hit some kind of threshold in August, since then, time triggers these suicidal feelings, like I am supposed to not be here anymore. Damn this is undescribable, even more than DPDR itself.
Most strange thing: IT FEELS LIKE I SHOULD HAVE DIED, SOME DARK FEELING WHICH EATS ME AND THAT I'D BE DESTINED TO SUICIDE! I have a really bad urge to feed in to these feelings even though I know Id made it worse...
I really have no clue how to recover from this hell. It feels like the only reason I feel like that is because I have a strong belief that something has to die or that something is very wrong with my mind.
Any suggestions?",09Dec2017,1
20,"I'm sure you read the title and thought this was silly, but please here me out. I sometimes get into these phenomenons where I will feel depressed about not having a girlfriend. I've never had a girlfriend in my life, or come close to it. I generally really want to get married someday, and I would love a girlfriend in my life. Not having one is normally a non issue to me. Most days it's just whatever when it comes to not having romance in my life. Like I would normally feel like I'd rather be with someone, but there's nothing wrong with not being with someone.

However I sometimes go into these stretches, which could be as short as a couple days, could be as long as a month, normally a week or two where I will just get fixated on the whole girlfriend thing. Like thoughts of getting a girlfriend will run wild through my head. Since I'm completely irrelevant to women, these thoughts don't make me feel to good.

23,"So, the past several years, after I was (automatically) terminated from my job at Wal-Mart, I began hearing what I thought had to be auditory hallucinations, that have been progressively getting worse and more invasive.
I told my doctor, and she prescribed me Risperadal which I've been taking now for a few months but it hasn't done anything to combat the situation. 
I'm becoming less convinced they are hallucinations.. When I'm at home, it sounds like the nieghbors (IDK precisely which ones) are talking about me, particularly about things I have been writing online, or things I say or do when I'm alone. For example, I made a silly racist joke on my drive home from work, and the 'hallucination' outside my bedroom window was laughing and mentioning I was a racist. It's usually always  a small group of people, usually one or two, one male and one female.

Anyway, I set-up my phone in a few places where I was hearing these voices, and unfortunately, I can also usually hear them in the recording, particularly if I upload it to my PC and doctor up the EQ. At least, I think I can.. It's usually people talking shit about me, insulting me, commenting, calling me a creep ect even though I haven't done anything serious or even hurt anyone in any way shape or form.

The problem is, I hear a very similiar thing while I'm at work, and I work the overnight shift with like 3 or 4 other people in the building but I still hear these voices, although they are different, and the female counterpart has never once been involved in those situations. I feel like this has to be a hallucination because if it's loud enough for me to hear the 3 other people who are all accounted for and not even talking they would hear it too, but of course no one else is their to even be talking. It gets worse when the store opens and co-workers/people start showing up.

I've had some very weird experiences that I can't explain. For example, early on in my job at Wal-mart, the Store Manager was walking with some other employees and they saw me, and it was very obvious they didn't like me but they also couldn't have even known who I was at least not enough to matter, and she says ""He just lives a different lifestyle it's fine."" Bear in mind I didn't know these people at all, and the store manager could not have reasonably known anything about how I life my life.
Other weird experiences that would indicate people know about things I'm doing or have done they no one could possibly know under normal circumstances.

Anyway, this is making my life absolute hell. Does this sound like the ravings of someone who is having very intense hallucinations and falling deeper into that hole?

Please and thanks. If someone is down to listen to one of these recordings so I can have a second opinion I'd appreciate it.. I think I intend to tell my doctor I've starting to become convinced these experiences are not hallucinations..

Another experience that makes me think it IS a hallucination is the fact that one night it was scaring me so much that I left the house and drove and sat in a Wal-Mart parking lot and I could still very intensely hear these voices talking about me from outside my car.. they would have had to have been right on my ass following me around and then yelling out these conversations which seems ludicrous. When I got home, I could then hear these voices, one in particular mentioning how I think their my friend even though they hate me and think I'm a loser, coming from the direction of a neighbor behind a fence across the street. Unfortunately for me, sometimes I actually do hear these people talking for real, and the voices sound the same.

I think maybe I'm just losing it hard. I've had some other experiences that make me doubt it's hallucinations as well, but they could have been flukes I guess.

Anyway, thanks again for reading if anyone actually read this.",09Dec2017,3
25,"Edit: Imposter Syndrome* stupid iPad.

A little backstory. I am a veteran of the US Army. I was medically separated with a fully honorable discharge for severe anxiety and depression that was incurred/made worse with my service. I have a disability rating of 100%, with service connection. A few years ago my mother (whom I now feel has borderline personality disorder) blew up, my brother almost killed himself over my mother’s actions, I had to put my Military Police training to use to de-escalate the entire situation, and now I don’t talk to my mother anymore. Her reason for blowing up was because she doesn’t believe there is anything wrong with my brother or myself (my brother is a Marine Corps vet with 100% due to PTSD. He saw some f’d up stuff)

I get paid about $5,000/mo because I can’t really leave my house (in fact I am writing this on my iPad right now. My children have a wrestling tournament and I couldn’t stay inside because of my anxiety). 

Ever since I started receiving benefits I feel I am unworthy. I live in fear of being accused of fraud, or my doctors saying ""the medications don’t seem to be helping. Therefor we conclude you don’t have an issue, and therefor don’t need benefits.""... I fear everyday that my benefits will be taken away and I will lose everything.

Now I know imposter syndrome generally looks at accomplishments and how you downgrade them in your head, and you are afraid people will find out you haven’t earned your ""successes"" or ""accomplishments"".... my disability stuff isn’t something I would call either of those..... does it still fall into the realm of imposter syndrome?",09Dec2017,2
