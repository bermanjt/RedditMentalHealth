2,"I've been feeling extremely depressed and suicidal for the past couple of months. My psychiatrist diagnosed me as bipolar, but I'm starting to feel like I'm just depressed all the time. I was a pretty good student last semester (4.0 gpa/honor roll, taking a lot of advanced placement classes), but now I have only b's and c's. I'm so tired all the time that I just sleep through all my classes; when I get home I have these weird crying attacks. Like I'll just be doing homework or something, and then I'm on the floor, curled up in the fetal position, crying for an hour or even more. Every time it happens I just end up going to sleep right after because I'm so tired and drained. I get nothing done because I'm sleeping for 14-15 hours a day, and yet I'm still so exhausted all the time. whenever I try to work on homework or study, I feel incredibly overwhelmed, my chest starts to hurt, and I can't focus or think about what I'm supposed to be working on.

I don't want to be whiny or anything, and i know that I should just suck it up and deal with it, but everything is so fucking overwhelming and I'm so tired of planning out my suicide every single day only to chicken out and do nothing. should I tell them?? I feel like they'll just think I'm trying to slack off and it won't change anything.

sorry if this isn't the right place to post somehting like this, i wasn't sure where else to go.

thanks 

p.s. i'm in my senior year of high school, if that helps with the context.",06Mar2017,9
3,"So I think I have Avoidant Personality Disorder, but I'm not sure. I fit all of the symptoms very well, as I take criticism very badly, over react to even minor insults, have no sociable occupations, am incredibly shy, have random, unpredictable mood swings multiple times a week, the list goes on. The thing is, I don't know who to talk to. I am under 18 so need a parent to go to a GP but I am scared of talking to my parents in case they dismiss what I'm saying or judge me. I've tried talking to my girlfriend about it because she knows a good deal about mental health (she's suffers with mental health issues) but I always feel like she's judging me, even though I know she's not. What should I do?

5,"A few years ago my mom paid for me to visit a specialist outside of Kaiser after we got frustrated that nothing was working well for me. The specialist prescribed Desoxyn and it was a friggin MIRACLE pill. My mom paid a shitload of money for the prescription since it was outside of my network. I told my Kaiser doctor how well it was working and she prescribed the next bottle for me. About a month later, she called me to tell me that the head of the department wants me pulled from the medication because it is a methamphetamine and has a high risk of abuse. Frustrated, I expressed that it was the only medication in over 10 years that was actually helping my ADHD and I had NO negative side affects. I told her I wasn't the type of person to abuse drugs and asked if we could continue if she closely monitored me. She said no and said the department won't allow it. I don't understand why a medication would exist if patients aren't allowed to take it? Is kaiser lying because of the expensive price of the medication? Is there anyway to get around this and get back on it? She put me back on adderrall and it's not doing anything for my focus...it's just keeping me up all night and I'm not eating. I didn't have those problems with desoxyn. Help!",06Mar2017,1

Not being able to call or visit her has been tearing me apart. My job is stressing me out, but I need it to pay off my student loans ($20k).

9,"Nothing unfortunate is occurring in my life. I have loving, nurturing parents who strive to make me happy and treat me like a little angel. I'm an honor student with a 4.0+ GPA, and my peers consider me the ""smartest person in the world."" Nobody is bullying or ostracizing me at school. I'm still regarded as a loner, though. Everything is just dull. :/

It all started when I read one of, if not, the most f*cked up, most disturbing story I've ever come across. Initially, I wasn't very attached to it and viewed it as a tragic murder case. That's all. I don't know when it started, but it eventually became an obsession.

I had these unwelcoming, yet incessant thoughts wherein I was the victim of the crime, and they are too formidable to regulate. Day after day and night after night, I would be haunted by the memories of the victim's suffering-- their tears, their groans, their screams, their blood. Everything. I felt as if I were them. 

Oh, God, I want to kill myself just so I can reunite with her! Ahh! Such an exquisite, beautiful young lady ruined by despicable wild animals! And they all received lenient sentences. Not fair. The complete travesty of the justice system! I've spent so many restless, sleepless nights thinking about that girl. I can't relax because I just keep on imagining how she must have felt. What is wrong with me? 

This horrific incident occurred way before I was born. There was nothing I could do to prevent it. Still, it pains me every time I remember her. In futile attempts, I've tried comparing it to the slaves or the Holocaust's victims just to reinforce that she wasn't the only human being to suffer at the hands of evil brutes. And it never works! I feel so related to her. So connected in an inexplicable way. Like I was her.

If I die, it won't be a personal pain. My loved ones will grieve and lament over my once cherished existence, not me. I will be oblivious to their suffering. Thus, I should have no qualms about carrying about my plans. But I do. Only slightly. :/",06Mar2017,8
10,"I've lived in this town for more than a decade. There's nothing here. It's a small town taken over by drugs and there's just no hope for prosperity or growth. So I've been giving some thought to moving to a different city in a different state, perhaps as early as this summer.

My problem is, I constantly worry if I'll actually be able to make it work. In order to get a new apartment, I need a positive reference from my current landlord. I worry I won't get one though. I've been here for 8 years, but he and I haven't always seen eye-to-eye. I do pay my rent on time- sometimes even early, however I still worry he would give me a bad reference based on past issues and I won't be able to find a new apartment anywhere.

I also have the same fears regarding my employer. I've been there for almost 5 years now, but there are definitely tensions between myself and my superiors. I am an excellent worker, they give me praise at times- but it is my feeling, in the things they say and how they treat me that suggests they aren't being completely honest with me. So in other words, I do not fully trust my employer or any of my co-workers. And I fear if I asked for a reference, I would not receive a good one. And not that they have anything bad to say about me, that's the thing. I am one of the most honest, loyal and reliable people on staff. But I fear something would be said, and without a good reference, finding a new job will be almost impossible.

Okay, first of all I'm a 24 year old male who's always been lazy and enjoyed substance abuse and has always been slightly anxious and a bit unhappy, clumsy, distracted and sensitive. Now, in October I started to get an ugly insomnia and then  was diagnosed with clinical depression, said fuck the anti depressants and I'm going to wait it out. So from October all the way to mid March I had a rowdy insomnia, stayed up days at a time and was very miserable and depressed (I also stopped smoking marijuana after heavy use for years) and well essentially life was hell. Throughout my miserableness I was also very paranoid I was developing another mental illness or at least a thought disorder (which brought me ENDLESS HORRIBLE ANXIETY) cause of how cluttered my thoughts were and still are BUT, my insomnia and even my depression went away already but I still have the inability to concentrate and the androhenia.  I still ruminate about all of this and am still kind of paranoid of having something serious even though the bulk of my symptoms have subsided.

16,"(disclaimer) I worked to create content for this startup, but I am not paid for marketing it. This sharing is purely my own initiative.

Recently, I provided work for a startup which core team comprise of neuroscientists and engineers. The closest one I worked with published over 250 publications in areas relating to mental health. 
They developed a platform where you can use big data analytics to assess and manage brain and mental health disorders. 

What that means is, the platform analyzes many aspects of your 'being' - ie your blood type, your behaviour, your moods, your brainwave pattern, your facial recording, etc - and makes a personal assessment from there. If it detects something (it can even detect early-stage conditions, which is pretty cool imo), the AI advisor will give recommendations on what exactly to do. For example, if memory is worsened (early-stage dementia), it'll give brain training games. There are other recommendations in the platform. 

The platform is not ready yet and scheduled to be launched in July 2017. They are doing a crowdfunding campaign now. I won't share the link in case it's frowned upon here, but I do want to give this heads up to the community. You can PM me for their name though, I'll be happy to share privately.

19,"I am in college now so live on my own, but I occasionally go back to my parents' home because it is not very far. There lives my parents and my older sibling. Every time I go back, I feel like a completely different person because I start having a TON of negative thoughts. I have a hard time communicating with my family so all those frustrations flood my brain. Now as I'm older, I have a hard time opening up to my sibling, who had always been my number one support; I have a hard time connecting with my father who has some narcissistic personality traits which have become more and more apparent to me and I see it as a very damaging quality to both himself and to the family; I have a hard time communicating complex thoughts with my mother because she does not think deeply about things as I do. Thus I feel misunderstood and unheard half the time. I always end up crying because I have no other way to let out my frustrations. I struggle with social anxiety so it amplifies the frustration of my communication difficulties when they're with the people who I am supposed to be the closest to.

21,"So, hopefully I'm not too drunk to delete this post tomorrow. 

I think I have posted about two posts, that I end up deleting the next day. 

I had a website I posted to, but due to some bullshit, I stopped posting. 

It was really stupid. 

I've been playing a lot of online games, and have run into several shitty admins. 

So, when an admin starts being an ass, I stop dealing with it. 

I can't have anymore stress, especially when it's over something so stupid. 

The last couple of posts, I don't really remember. 

I just remember deleting them. 

But anyway, I know I need to ask for help. 

But I don't want help. 

How am I supposed to get help in the first place? 

I see a therapist and a psychiatrist. 

But, they both trust me too much I think. 

I started drinking a couple months back, and I hadn't for about a year. 

I'm in a really shitty place. But I'd rather.... 

Actually, I don't know what the fuck I want. 

I want to die, I want to live. 

I have more reasons as to why I want to die. 

I can't stand my family, they used to be absolutely shitty to me. 

They still are. 

So, I avoid them as much as I can. 

I isolate myself a lot. 

I get incredibly angry over stupid shit. 

I have also had several friends kill themselves. 

It doesn't really scare me. 

I... think I want convincing to go get help. 

But, I really don't know. 

I have friends, but I'd rather avoid them. 

I think part of it is wanting to make myself more depressed. 

I want to kill myself, I want to isolate myself from anything remotely important. 

I'm not who my family wanted me to be, and my sibling is a flying piece of shit. 

I almost killed them as soon as I figured out what they did. 

I have PTSD, so I don't remember most of my life. 

I'm paranoid beyond belief, so I ignore things pretty often. 

I really don't want to go to the crisis house, all I want to do is play game and drink. 

I guess, all I can really say is that I hope I make up my mind soon.

It took 3 full grown adults to get me out of bed &amp; into the shower just so that I could go to school. But the attacks got so bad, I ended up not going to school for several months. Eventually, I was able to transfer to a new school. It was a long &amp; slow process before I could actually go to school without a yaya because the attacks would come without warning.

27,"(Backstory) So for just about over a year now I've lost someone who I considered family to suicide. It was sudden and in all honesty at the time of his death I was confused and I even kind of felt betrayed (as into why did he do it and why he didn't come to any of his friends for help) He left no note, nothing. Leaving his death the biggest mystery in my life.

2 weeks before he killed himself I messaged him demanding I come over to see him and talk about how he was doing as he wasn't really being himself. He was being distant and less talkative. I felt like I was one of the few people who noticed he wasn't ok but not in the sense that he wanted to end his own life. What triggered my suspicions was that one day when he had all his friends over (he was a charming and popular dude) and he wasn't engaging with anyone and he just seemed to observe everyone else which was very unlike him. I'd stare at him looking at everyone and giving them a smile whilst not participating in any of the small talk.

Throughout our chat we talked about Science (he loved astrology), theories on quantum mechanics, our passions, dreams and girls. He had everything going for him. But what he ultimately told me was that he wasn't feeling himself and that he felt lost as the person he was now. I tried convincing him that this is only a small period which will pass, that the only person he has to please is himself and no one else, to not give two shits about what anyone else thought of him because as long as he knows and those who loved him know that he's a good guy, that's all that matters. But he was a people pleaser and found a lot in discomfort in what he thought people were thinking of him.

I know during that period some of the people he considered his oldest and closest friends were distancing themselves from him because of some of the choices he was making which were none of their concern or problem.

We talked for 3 hours and before I left his house he came up to me and said ""thank you"" and gave me a hug. I found this oddly strange coming from him but I hugged him back and said ""I love you brother I'm here for you no matter what.""

He then took his own life over a week later with no letter.

When I look back on it I feel like I'm able to tell at that moment he was saying his final goodbye to me. I still think about him everyday and treasure that moment.

If I knew what I know now I would have never have left his house and never had let go when he had hugged me. He was like a brother to me and I cherished every moment I had with him even if it were brief moments. He knew how to make anyone smile and he brought so many people together.

30,"Things aren't going great lately, but I feel I can't talk to anyone I know about it. I don't really want their perception of me to change so I avoid talking about myself even though I really want to. I thought that maybe Reddit would listen.

I've had depression and anxiety problems for as long as I can remember but I took quite a hit the past few weeks. I've dated a few girls before, but things never seem to work out for reasons beyond me. Either I don't feel like it would work out or I have to move from the city (due to my school's work program), but I finally met a fantastic girl. She's interesting, pretty and clever. We went out for a few dates, before out of nowhere she started becoming distant. She cancelled plans or stopped replying my messages. Out of nowhere she dumped me through text without explaining why. This was after not seeing her for 3 weeks, I was so anxious waiting for a reply and her memory was slowly fading away. I hit rock bottom at this point, I liked her too much and felt it would be close to impossible to find someone like her. I tried and tried to make myself feel better but nothing would work. It only got worse from here. Two days afterwards it was the day I would know through my school's system if I got an internship for the next 4 months. I got rejected by every single place that I applied for. A couple of those had even sent me follow-ups and were looking up. My psyche was at an all time low. I had never felt like this before. Like such a failure in life. I lost every desire of fulfilling any long term goals I had. Watching shows and playing games feels like just going through a checklist of things to do, not really enjoying what I'm doing and just expecting that the next thing I watch or play is better and actually makes me feel better. Everyday feels like I only keep going because of routine or instinct. I don't find much meaning for anything I do and the people around me only seem to make it worse. I'm going through life expecting a new girl or a new job will pop up, but as time passes by I feel like I sink deeper into boredom and conformity.

31,"Nobody liked me in middle school. My parents were very close to getting a divorce. I attempted suicide. But everybody hates middle school!

High school I was well respected by my peers, teachers, parents, bosses, and adult mentors most of them considered me to be very intelligent. Most of all, I was happy, and I felt productive, I had friends.  
Excellent standardized test scores, 4.0 GPA, college credit, and amazing letters of reference were not enough for me to get into any in state university. So I went to community college.  After initial bitterness I continued being known as I had been in high school. I have never been happier than I was my second year there. 

But then I had to have shoulder surgery. Years later and the chronic pain hasn't gone away.
Then I discovered through back spasms that I have scoliosis.
Then I discovered that my body doesn't make enough platelets.
Then my spleen got infected causing my immune system to shut down my nervous system to the point that half of my body was paralyzed. I have since recovered from the paralysis but I still have an unhealthy, painful, sensitive spleen. 

Through all of this my 4.0 college GPA dropped to a 3.0 and so no engineering school wanted me, I had to settle on studying at a liberal arts college where there is only one section for all of my (engineering) classes, they are only offered once a year and there is no room for electives. But worst of all for me I am away from my family, friends, and support I had. A lot of my classes didn't transfer so I am now in my 5th year in college and am still only taking 200 level classes and won't graduate for another 2 years.

Between community college and university I have applied to over 600 scholarships and grants. I have received just shy of $400 over 5 different scholarships. That's not a typo. 

Despite being promised $1000 research money per student for the engineering department when I enrolled we have since lost our director and half of the department budget. Somebody messed up big time, and halfway through a semester that all of my classes required access to a shop, the on campus shop closed to students. 

I am frustrated at the department for this, among numerous other things (including being falsely accused of paying someone to write my term paper, and failing the final exam for a tough class despite getting all of the answer correct), and it has caused me to completely lack interest in the subject, and all of my schooling. I have given it my all to no avail. 

Being homesick, fighting chronic pain, and having no interest in classes with asshole professors who didn't give a shit, I fell into a depressive state. I haven't been paying attention in classes all semester and a few weeks ago, I practically didn't leave my bed for ten days. The devastation this did to my grades, and what it would do if it continued or happened again I sought professional mental health. A counselor and PA suggested I try counseling and taking Lamictal to see if I could pull myself out of it and to help both my frustration levels and depression. 

The complete turn around it had in my life when I started taking it, driving for hours to see friends, family, compulsive cleaning, kiss-assery, and getting great grades, was, to me, amazing, and the folks that knew how bad I was were astonished, happy for me, and glad of the results of my productivity. 

But I finally got in to see the psychologist and he was really worried about this manic stage I had been on since starting the medicine. He diagnosed me as bipolar and is now pairing it Lamictal with Lithium. 

I'm sitting here with the unfilled prescription bewildered, crying, and scared. I don't know if I should accept this, and take the medicine (for god knows how long) and keep trudging through this terrible program or to throw out this piece of paper and start my life anew somewhere else doing something I love. 

TLDR: My life sucks, got diagnosed as bipolar due to productive manic reaction to Lamictal. Should I take Lithium or try to find a better life?",06Mar2017,1
32,"It is the very first time I share my story or rather my concerns. Never ever have I shared my concerns before as I feel ashamed of the issues I have with my mental health, therefore this is a throwaway account.

I had a bit of a difficult childhood, at least that is what I tell people I am very close to. However, I do not know anymore if the stories I tell are real or have just being fabricated by my mind. My memories of my childhood are quite hazy, especially the time spent outside of my home. As this story might get quite confusing I will start from the first event/story of which I doubt the veracity.

When I was younger, my parents put me in a Kindergarten so that I would spend more time with children speaking the language from the country I lived in (I spoke a different language at home). My parents do recall me feeling pretty miserable there and it was decided in the later years that I would only go there in the morning and be schooled at home after that. This is the only thing I know to be real. I also know that other Kids did indeed report that the caretakers discriminated against foreigners and there was some talk that they were abusive. I told my parents when I was in primary school that I had been abused there: I was supposedly deprived of food and was insulted and even physically abused. The big problem with that is that I don't remember any of these events anymore ... I am soo scared that I lied about that in my childhood to get some attention and I cannot get rid of this feeling. I feel like a compulsive liar and hate the being I have with these lies passionately. 

Then comes the next event I am not quite sure about: the two major illnesses I suffered from in my life. I was in primary school when I started to complain about my knee hurting and suddenly falling over. After a long time with no diagnosis, I was tested for Lyme disease and it came back as positive. I was treated for it and got better. However, I am still bothered by the fact that I feel like I lied about this to seek attention from my parents. I recently found out that the test that used to diagnose me has a percentage of false positives which further reinforced my fear that I lied about this. The second sickness that landed me in the hospital was the whooping cough. I went into respiratory distress several times and was treated for it. My mother claims she had it afterward as well but I still doubt whether or not I had this sickness and if therefore I made it up.

Then comes my strange psychological episodes. I lived in a country with a quite competitive schooling system that required very good grades in 4th grade to be able to access better schools. I managed to be accepted in one of the best high school in this area and in one of their elite classes. The pressure to perform was definitely there and after about three months, my mental health started to deteriorate. I was definitely depressed, however, my parents remember how I fled in what they called my subconscious. I would apparently act completely differently as if I were sleep walking or having some episode of intense delusion. This is again a part where I question if this was an intricate scheme to trick my parents into pitying me. I feel absolutely ashamed of myself that such a thing might have taken place and how much I have hurt my family. I hope this was not just an act but I really doubt myself. Those psychotic episodes lead me to be sent to my grandparents while my family relocated for me to come back to a less stressful environment. 

Let's now come to the present time, I definitely suffer from depression even though the fear from any kind of therapy has kept me away from consulting. I am planning on seeking help but know that I will never be able to share those fears with anybody. I will take those to my grave. As I mentioned before until recently my memories of my childhood were inaccessible. I do remember the time spent with my family but no event that happened in that Kindergarten or primary school (where I also doubt what I told my parent). The only 'memories' I have from these events is what I have told my parents at some point and I have been building my life story on them ever since.
I just had to get this off my chest and sorry for the long rant. While googling I have come across many different conditions but I struggle with putting a fitting name on what I feel. Sorry for this long rant.",06Mar2017,1
33,"Hi Reddit,
I'm sitting here looking at the keyboard and thinking about how to explain my situation. I'm not good with explaining or talking in general so bare with me...
Life story so this is a very long wall of text.
PS: English is not my first tongue.

I'm an Iraqi born guy, currently 21 years old, who's been living in Jordan for a little over 10 years. From an outside shell i always thought i had a good childhood but recently because of what has been happening with me, as i think and try to figure out why am i like this i can't find a reason. Because of my university studies i was reading a book by Christopher Alexander and i came up upon a sentence ( i can't remember the exact words), but it means that if a child does not spend time with other children growing up he will not be normal and that includes both humans and animals. I have a brother who's 7 years older than me, and because of that age difference  we weren't that close and he didn't prefer to spend time with me. We never had a good relationship. I haven't spoken him since about 5 months. Growing up i never went to kinder garden or nursery i was pretty much at home until first grade school. Because of the war my parents are very overprotective and they didn't let me out of the house and play with other kids in the street or something. I spent a lot of time alone, i used to talk and play with  my plushies, imaginary friends, cats ( i love cats )  and a fig tree in our garden. My father worked very late ( up to 10 somedays). So almost the entire day it was just me and mom in a very large house.

So i'm not NORMAL and this is my first problem. I have always struggled to fit in and to have friends, or at least long lasting friendships. I was the kid that would get picked last in a ""school"" game or something like that. I have had a few friends over the years that moved on at some point or another. In my last year of high school i pretty much had no friend. 

I don't have or at least i don't think i have Social anxiety. One would think i'm shy but i'm not, maybe i'm reserved but not shy.
Another HUGE problem which could be one of the reasons people don't like me or lose interest in me after spending time with me is that i don't talk. I like talking ( when i do ) i like being in a conversation i love hanging with people, i love people and i love listening. I just simply don't have anything to say most times. And most the things i talk about is asking questions and routine small talk. I can't explain very well and i can't tell a story in a fun way. The older i get the worse i get. I even stutter now... i didn't stutter when i was a child and it's embaressing and it's getting worse year by year.


And now i'm in my third year in college. During my school days i liked video gaming and i spent most of my time gaming( mostly online) i was little and naive. I didn't feel there was a problem. That i didn't have a social life outside of gaming ( who were amazing people). i stopped enjoying games overall and i stopped about 3years ago. After stopping my social life was non existing. Slowly i started to realise how lonely i am. It's a horrible feeling, like slowly dying the more time passes. 

Social life is very dominant in college and you see it everywhere. People chatting all the time and during their breaks between classes. They socialize in college, outside it, during the holiday, etc. Of course i'm always left out and uninvited. Even from the people i felt i was close to and worse... friends with. 

I did have people who i thought i was friends with, but i'm the one who would get left out or not be included in group's inside joke. I mainly had a group of friends that i will call The Group. I met them since the beginning. I also met another friend in my first day of college who's now my only friend. Sadly he switched to another college. We're still good friends and he's the only friend that i go out with ( actually my only friend in general ). And i'm tankful for that. Even though, hid humor gets on my nerves sometimes, but i love him. And i HATE breaks, contrary to literally everyone, because it's a reminder of how lonely i am, i just usually sit at the college's terrace and do nothing for an hour and a half. Sometimes i go to the piano room and play something. 

If you're still reading i'm reaching the point of posting this post.

So, with The Group i did use to be friendly with for a long while and i'd sit with them. I didn't talk alot which i hate but i enjoyed their company. It's better than being alone.

By the way i'm Bisexual.

In the First semester of second year. I was enrolled in a class. We had a project that we were supposed to work on a group of 4 on it. Anyway, i didn't know anyone that class because it was a first year subject that i didn't take and i'm taking it in my second year. So i didn't know anyone in that class. My chance i was grouped in a group. In that group there was a guy my age who transferred this semester to my college. I'll call him T. I noticed that he's different and not like most people ( not a bad way but a nice smart way). We finished the project, He and i pretty much did all the work ( it was a group of 4) . He worked hard and i liked that a lot about him. I was attracted to him since pretty much our first meeting. We became friends quickly. I felt very comfortable with him. I helped him easing in to the university and classes. Next semester we became even better friends, we also had more classes together and he was more introduced to the other people of our year. I liked almost everything about him. From his hard work, appearance, voice, way of speaking and cleanliness as i noticed from visiting his home. I would feel perfectly happy and serene just by being with him even if we didn't say or do anything together. And i never had full trust and felt completely comfortable with a stranger before that. I realized that i loved him. I never loved a guy nor a girl before him.

I think he's straight and i never told him i love him. 

During that semester he made more friends and also became friends with "" the group"". We were still best friends. But he became doing things that made me upset. Mainly ignoring me, forgetting me, not calling and asking where i'm at and lying to me. Even though i'm always there for him and would drop anything i'm doing to help him. It kills me from the inside when he does that. last semester ( First semester third year ). I and The Group were setting working in a class, and he came and greeted everyone but me. Litrerally greeted a guy infront of me but not me. Then a while later he called my name and asked for gum without even a Hi. I threw it at his face and said nothing, he didn't think something was wrong.

More time passes more he prefers company of the other guys. And later i find out they have been going out a lot of times and i was never invited. I couldn't believe he wouldn't tell me. I was talking with T and hinting at it and he said "" i just went out with the guys"" as if i'm not friends with them BEFORE him, and as if i'm not a ""guy"". I still loved him. Then came the break between semesters and we both did internships in different companies. Before the break we agreed that we'd go out and see a movie together the next saturday. ( was 3 days after the break started). I waited but he didn't call so i called and he said  sorry that he has a birthday party that came up that he needs to go to ,all i could think of is he's just going out with ""the guys"" and he didn't want to tell me so, i was boiling with rage. Anyway, he told me we can go the next day, which was a sunday, and i was like ok great. When he said that i felt more relaxed. Yup, next day he didn't call or confirm through a message, and as i was swiping through snapchat i saw his name... i was terrified knowing what i'm expecting to see and yup... he was out with ""The Group"", but that's not the problem. It's not like they called him to go out and he went out and forgot me, but they were in HIS house. He invited him and secluded me. I died from the inside. I have depression but i don't take medication. After sawing that picture, i died from the inside, and it was the first time in my life that i genuinely prayed to not wake up and die and was genuinely disappointed after waking up the morning after. Why do i suck socially? Why don't i have friends? 

Why people don't like me?
I'm a very nice person, people say i'm too nice so it's not that i think myself as nice but i'm not actually nice. I even look nice and people get surprised if they see me do a wild thing or listen to unusual music. 
I have always been there for him, the week before, we had projects submission. I had finished mine and he needed help so we stayed the entire night working on his project at his home. I couldn't even go back to my house and i had to go to university in my day old clothes without taking a bath. Why doesn't he appreciate me?

I'm madly in love him But after that happened i hated him, had to forget him and get over him. I removed him from snapchat so i don't see what he's doing. He called only once during that break just before the next semester start but i didn't, couldn't answer. I decided to accept that fact that i'm alone and will always be. I cut him off from my life. I also don't talk with ""the group"" again. Only if they say something to me and i speak very coldly to them.

And, next semester starts, the first day i avoid T and in a mutual class i sat to the opposite of wherever he and ""The Group"" do. I hate him but still in love with him. Ignoring him hurts. He did greet me the first day, i said quickly Hi. The next day he came to me while i was on my laptop and asked that i didn't look ok yesterday or sad. I just said why would i be sad, coldly. I think he knew something was odd. 

The reason i did that as the reason i'm writing this post.
i'm trying to cut him off from my life. But i love him. it's been 2weeks into the semester and after the first 2days he spoke to me he never spoke again. I thought this would be for the good but i still miss him and love him, same time hate him. 

The reason i'm trying to cut him off is, i'm mentally exhausted ( from everything i wrote so far ), i just can't afford being hurt again by anyone and especially not by someone who i love and admire like him. But i'm afraid with cutting him off, i'm losing two things, a friendship and someone i live ( He's straight though). If i didn't cut him off i'm only losing his love. What should i do? I'm mentally exhausted. I can't afford therapy and i'm losing my will to live. lost the will to study and hobbies. I used to be an A student but i'm getting worse. I'm barely average now. 

Every single goddamn night i just keep thinking about him and about being physically in touch him. It smoothes me to fantasies about him holding me. even though when i actually see him i hate him so much because he hurt me.

I lost my will to live, my love for hobbits, my will to study, will to do anything.

If i am to... restore our friendship, how would i initiate or explain it? if he asks what's been wrong what should i say? Note that i can't tell him that i love him or that i'm Bi. I never told anyone or my family about all of this and I can't do that. 

What should i do?
Sorry for the very long wall of text.

42,"Suffering from a pretty bad depressive episode with some anxiety thrown into the mix and my sleep is getting progressively worse. I feel like I'm in a vicious cycle where the lack of sleep is making my mental health worse yet my mental health is what is stopping me from sleeping well. 

I use a sleep tracker on my phone which is supposed to measure time spent awake, in light sleep and in deep sleep. For instance a good night would ideally have at least 2 or three period of deep sleep of about 45 minutes. Now I know these things aren't particularly accurate (I don't have a device like a fitbit or anything, just my phone next to the pillow) but it at least gives me some idea of what my sleep is like. For the past 4 or 5 nights I've had no deep sleep at all and before that I was only having a short period of about half an hour at about 7am just before I get up.

I'll also have 10+ periods where I'm awake. I struggle to get to sleep and wake up frequently in the night. I'll usually wake up at least once and know I'm awake and can't get back to sleep but according to the sleep tracker I'm also waking up for short periods of a few minutes. Although I don't remember these I'm sure they're affecting my sleep overall. The total amount I'm sleeping is also getting much shorter. It's gone from 6-7 hours to only 3.5 last night. 

The biggest problem is I feel like I'm already doing everything right! I'm 'asleep' (i.e. lights out, lying down, eyes shut) between about 11:30pm and 8:30am but the time I'm actually asleep in this period is still very little. I have a night time routine of getting into bed at about 9:30pm and turn off all screens at about 10:30 to read or listen to a podcast. When I am using my laptop or phone I use a blue light filter (such as Twilight or Flux). I don't usually nap during the day (apart from today where I had to get a couple more hours in because I couldn't stay awake) and I only have one coffee a day at breakfast. My bedroom is fairly cold, which I heard is good (also I'm a student so not much choice!) and I normally make a hot water bottle so I don't get uncomfortably cold feet. I also recently bought a mattress topper to make my bed more comfy, which has definitely made me a bit less unhappy when I can't sleep! 

I feel like I'm doing all the things I should do to help my sleep but nothing is working. I just need any extra advice or something that might have worked for other people! I really don't want to go down the route of sleeping pills which will knock me out because I don't want to end up relying on them. I've heard other people talk about melatonin being helpful. Does it have many side effects? And does it get prescribed in the UK?

TL;DR - Looking for 'natural' ways to get better sleep, apart from all the things I've already tried (sensible bedtime and good routine, avoiding screens, not napping in the day, no screens 1 hour before bed, temperature right, comfy bed)",06Mar2017,1
48,"Sorry I'm not good at wording my thoughts but need to tell someone about this, this is a re post but i didn't get a lot of advice on my previous one

I'm 18 been smoking weed for about 3 years until recently I'm normally full of energy but for the last few months I haven't been feeling right at first I started getting paranoid when I smoked weed I don't know how long this went on it probably started back about half way through summer it wasn't Everytime I smoked but some of the times usually when I was by myself the reasons I got paranoid were always different and but many of the times I was nearly completely freaking out and would find it near impossible to calm down I would always get stuck in dark trains of thought. 

This carried on until about October I don't know when exactly and things started getting worse I started getting paranoid and anxious during times when I hadn't been smoking weed I've been feeling like I have two trains of thought in my head one which makes sense and the other which freaks out and thinks the worst in situations I often find now that I'll get stuck in dark trains of thought and just get lost its hard to stop thinking bad shit once it starts at this point I had started feeling slightly scared of strangers and thinking people were always staring at me.

Around this time I developed a crush on someone it made me feel literally mad like I'd sometimes start thinking too deep about everything and would often get stuck on a train of thought that she hated me and become obsessed over the next few weeks I had fully convinced myself that she was undercover police but sometimes I was in a right mind state to tell myself it wasn't true but others I would properly freak out 

Come early November I think it was bonfire night, actually I might need to add that I had been taking other drugs recreationally for a year often would be MDMA or pills and occasionally I would take acid never by myself it was always with friends at party's and gigs anyway on bonfire night I decided I would like to trip the day had been going well and I had been enjoying the experience until later on when the tripping had died down i decided to take some pill as I was going to a party I had been feeling fine until a bit later on I got stuck on the thought that the person I had a crush on was undercover police at this point as I was mentally but i started freaking out on top of that I started feeling that other people were out to get me then I heard a lot of police sirens outside in the distance and thought the police were coming to get me this sent me in to a full on freakout and into dark trains of thought 

I needed to leave the house so I got my stuff and left over the next week's after this I had been feeling paranoid and such I managed to get the police thought out of my head but it's sorta in the back of my mind Everytime I see this person and it scares me i just stopped talking to the girl just the way I felt while having a crush on her messed me up and made me feel weird and it was often hard to deal with so I decided to stop talking to her for a while. 

Then I fell ill which lasted about 3 weeks so I missed a lot of college during this time I was at home slot just left to myself and my thoughts with not a lot of distraction and I would very often get stuck in dark trains of thought I got better but have struggled to go back to college over the past 2-3 months I haven't been feeling normal during this time I stopped smoking weed as the paranoia and anxiety happens Everytime I smoke. I used to go out and see my friends almost every day and now I can barely leave my house I often feel like all my friends hate me and everyone's out to get me and often feel as if I'm being watched I have to tell myself it's not true but it's hard once I get onto these trains of thought I get stuck on them for days.

Hardly anything seems fun anymore  most days I have been feeling numb or like everything is pointless I also haven't been sleeping properly I either have trouble getting to sleep or have nights where I will keep waking up and then struggle to get back to sleep. I have been struggling with social interaction and college in general ive been having trouble holding down conversations i either just get distracted or feel like I can't talk to anyone I've always had trouble with focus on my work but have been finding it harder than usual another thing is that I can't make eye contact with people it weirds me out and makes me uncomfortable 

Also I tripped again at some point maybe over a month ago since then I have decided not to take drugs i hardly understood what was going on as I just got dark trains of thought and I saw eyes everywhere I also took a bit of pill last week I actually felt normally while I was up but as soon as I came down i felt like complete shit and couldn't think anything other than dark thoughts. I have decided I'm not taking drugs anymore 

Also on days I have been feeling randomly like I'll need to break down and cry or certain things will make me feel like the world is ending I lost my memory stick yesterday and nearly had a breakdown, I also just don't feel safe when I'm out of my house 

Sorry this is so long but Ive been needing to ask about this 
Does anyone have any advice or ways to cope?

I have used drugs but I don't think that is part of the issue because I don't feel like I need them
