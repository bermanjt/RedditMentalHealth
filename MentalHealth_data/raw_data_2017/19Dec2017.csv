0,"For a couple of years now i've had this weird feeling every so often that's sort of like I step out of my body and out of reality, i've researched about it and the only thing I can find is derealization but i've read that only happens in high stress moments/trauma.

This thing happened recently again, I was just have a normal conversation with my mother (me and her are close, I can tell her anything so I can't see me having any sort of anxiety around her) and it's as if as I was talking I left my body and couldn't tell reality or tell who this face infront of me was, like it was some sort of film or video but it only lasts for 10-20 seconds and im back to normal reality, but it usually takes me a few minutes to get over it and it's kind of disturbing to feel.

I'm just wondering if anyones had this or has any idea what it is, sorry for the longish read haha.

1,"Hi! So, I am someone who has been struggling with mental health issues for a large part of my life (depression and ADHD, mostly, with some anxiety and eating disorder stuff just to make everything extra fun) but for certain reasons beyond my control I'm not currently in therapy or taking meds. While I'm trying to fix that, I have a question about certain behaviours and what they are/if they're symptomatic of something/basically what is happening. Over the past several months I've had several incidents (once every two or three weeks, let's say) where for several hours at a time I have felt completely full of energy. Utterly wired, buzzing, like it feels like my entire body is shaking inside. During these times I am incredibly happy, bouncy, and ready to do absolutely anything people suggest. Usually I'm completely sober when these times occur, although by the end I'm often not. I feel on top of the world, but also completely out of control. Eg. I've tried to get my friends to let me sit on top of a moving car. Completely ridiculous shit. Luckily, I have amazing friends who will sit with me, restrain me from doing terrible things, etc. However, I'm scared of what will happen if one of these times happens when I'm completely alone. Does anyone else have times like this? How do you deal with it? I'm feeling pretty desperate right now as I don't know how to cope with these times. ",19Dec2017,2
2,"**Please read, sorry it's a bit long:** He had a bad experience with therapy a few years ago before I was his girlfriend - it was in his very tiny small town, the therapist dangled some healing rocks above him, and haphazardly explained CBT - and now he is biased to believe that all therapy will be as useless and embarrassing.

So, he knew that he had anxiety since a little after high school (he's 24, so about 6 years ago when he was 18 it began). It was a bit of a chicken-egg situation, in that the anxiety caused chest and stomach pains, and his chest and stomach pains caused anxiety. The first 2 years of our relationship is when it was the worst (he was 20-22); he could't leave the house without me, and when we did leave the house, we would almost always go home sooner than planned because of his anxiety. Social settings were hard if not impossible, and panic attacks were so intense he'd sometimes throw up, sometimes cry himself to sleep. Even though we both knew he was unhealthily anxious, he was sure there was something seriously wrong with his heart and stomach, and that's how I managed to get him to a doctor (after many months of failed attempts and missed appointments). 

The doctor immediately recognised signs of General Anxiety Disorder, and said so. My boyfriend wasn't convinced, and so for peace of mind only, she agreed to do scans of his heart using an ECG machine, and the results showed that there was nothing wrong. He did have hernias in his stomach, completely benign and nothing to worry about. After these few appointments, getting the results, and then accepting that his fears were unfounded and a result of an anxiety disorder, he improved massively. The doctor recommended a psychologist (who he didn't see), and exercise (he improved here but not very much or routinely).

Our lives got so much better when he accepted that he had this disorder, and could explain his worries to himself. We could leave the house, he could go places without me, he stopped having panic attacks altogether, and our relationship bloomed because I was able to be more independent because he was less dependant. That was around 2 years ago, when he was turning 23. Now, there's a clear catalyst for a relapse of sorts in the past month: A. We made a rushed decision to move out of our beloved city apartment. B. We've been very broke. C. He got a new job.

He hates our new suburb, and the time it takes for him to travel to his new job. He feels like he has no free time anymore now that he has a full-time job, and that he spends an extra 2 hours each day getting there and back. And we've been so broke since moving (and he hasn't been paid yet), which has been causing tension and worry. These are extremely valid reasons and causes for him to begin to feel out of control, negative, and anxious again. He is in a terrible mood in the mornings before work, I'm walking on eggshells. At night before bed he is sad, obsessively checking the time and worrying about getting enough sleep. He says things like ""life sucks"" and ""everything is shit"" more and more. 

We're going to try to transfer our rental lease and move back to the city, but this won't happen for a couple of months due to money and opportunity, at the least - So what can I do to encourage him until then? He isn't interested in therapy as I said, and he is very hard to motivate or cheer up. He thinks we won't get a place, we won't find anyone to transfer our lease to, he thinks he won't be good at his job and isn't learning fast enough, etc etc... SO to get to the point: What can I do to make the next few months more bearable and more positive and constructive for him? I've taken on all of the housework and am cleaning up after him, even though it annoys me because when he feels this way he is recklessly messy (this morning in a bit of anger, he threw some bread on the floor and just left it there). Should I be asking him to do more around the house to keep him productive or something, or would it be more stress? I'm about to go away for a week on a family holiday - I can't cancel it, it's paid for, and I'm very close with my family and only get this chance to be all together once every few years - and he can't come due to work, and I'm kind of worried he'll quit his job. His little brother is gonna come up and stay for that week, and I think he generally is a good influence and is very light and fun, so that's awesome. But still. What can I do? We might be here for months longer. How can I make it better? *Can* I make it better?

**TL;DR:** My boyfriend has a history of General Anxiety Disorder, and our current situation may be exacerbating it. We will likely be in this situation for a few more months, so what can I do to help? (he's not willing to go to therapy)",19Dec2017,2
3,"Hi. I have had a depression before and I somehow  managed to cure it by working my self out. I've been working 6 days a week 10-12 hours each day for about a year and a half. Everything seemed to be fine, I earned more than my both parents combined I'm (21) and I often went out with my friends. However a week ago i got vacation and i have nothing to do. Depressive thoughts came up again. I have 2 more weeks left without working and I'm seriously worried.

It's 2AM and i can't sleep. I realized that I haven't truly been myself for ever. This realization is huge for me. On FB I've never had a profile pic or made a post yet i have been using social media for years. On instagram i have 4 meaningless photos and I'm scared to post anything.

Tried to find a reason why I'm afraid to express myself. I think it's because the relatives, parents and my group of friends. They all have something in common - talking smack behind each others back. I never do that and i hate that practice deeply. Sometimes my parents discuss how horrible mistakes i have made (loudly) even my friends are quick to point things out.

I'm paranoic of others opinion so i do nothing except for job.

Tonight I plan on deleting everything whats connected to old me (really not much)... I plan on leaving the country and vaguely explain where only to my parents and change my identity. Maybe then I could become what I trully want to be. 

Is this a good idea? What's wrong with me?

5,"Curious if anyone else has? My doc has prescribed 25mg of Topomax (Topirimate) to be taken at bedtime for off-label use as a mood stabilizer, and she believes it will assist with my insomnia as well. 

It hasn't been long enough to make a full judgement yet, but I'm not necessarily disappointed so far. It does make me groggy about an hour after taking it - I don't understand how people can take this as a morning med or even morning/evening combo. 

I am getting some undesirable side effects already, however they are mild; so I can live with them should it help my BPD. I forget words mid-conversation. My life has turned into a giant game of charades. That's fine, as most are understanding and helpful. The only other negative I've experienced is that carbonated drinks are no longer an option for me. Every single one tastes flat.

6,"I'm concerned that my doctor might be considering diagnosing me with bipolar. Neither of us have brought it up, but I'm concerned I might have it and think my doctor has started to consider it too. 

I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for 8 years. Recently, I've been falling in and out of depressive episodes at a higher rate than normal. I'm not sure that it's mania, as it isn't an extreme high. It could just be what normal feels like, I just don't know because of had depression for as long as I can remember.

My doctor is concerned about my depression oscillating like this and has added trileptal to my meds to see if this will help. I might be wrong in thinking he's considering bipolar, but I'm not finding anything on using it for unipolar depression. Is there a chance my doctor is testing to see if this works before adding a diagnosis? I plan to bring up the possibility of me having it if I don't start improving by my next appointment, but am curious for an outsiders perspective.",19Dec2017,4
7,"So today i brought my skateboard to school (i had just made that skateboard 1 day ago) it was my first time bringing it to school because i wanted to skate with my friends. i went to school and everything was fine until 6th period i put my board net to all my friends boards in the front of the class in teacher view i everything was good but then my friend noticed it was gone his and my other friends skateboard was still there  he told me and i was in shock so was the teacher there was no possible way someone could have stolen it me and my friends looked ALL OVER the school and couldn't find my skateboard so i finally realized that i was screwed so i called my guardian and told them what happened they told me that ""it was dumb of me to bring the skateboard in the first place"" and i agree but i was scared and didn't want to face my guardian so i stalled until i knew i had to go so my friends walked me over to my guardians car and we just waited there they tried to cheer me up by making me laugh and stuff and my guardian is coming towards me and my friends she see's me and my friend proceeds to say what happened and he also said he got his board stolen too (which is a lie so i don't get in too much trouble) so she drove me home and just tells me it was dumb to me (also note that this person who is my guardian is a REALLY REALLY NICE PERSON AND ONLY CARES ABOUT ME) she/he just says stuff that he/she has never said in her life about me so at this point i'm crushed when i get home i go straight to the bathroom and take a shower and cry the entire time I NEED HELP idk why but its like everywhere i go whoever i meet i will always mess up and make that person dislike me i try so hard to be a good kid but im too dumb to realize what im doing i my guardian then says the thinks its my friends who took the skateboard and at this point i dont even know she then says that im not focusing in school (which is true but tbh high school is REALLY HARD FOR ME and i just feel so dumb compared to the other kids ) and now im in this borderline relationship with her and i want her to be proud to call her my guardian and want her to think good about me and not think im just hanging out with bad people I really need help if you have advice PLZ give me some ",19Dec2017,2

10,"Ok, I have this problem. Where I live it is 4 in the morning right now, I've been having lots of problems with sleep lately. This night was the first in a few weeks when I got to sleep at a normal hour 11 pm, but I was waked up by a nightmare at 2 am and I can't sleep. Also, me and my girlfriend are saparated for 1 month ( we live 70 km apart), but I'm trying to move her in with me. That's the back story, now let's get to my problem.

I was a little bit of a paranoid person for as long as I know, but lately, I think I'm geting insane. As I waked up by my nightmare 2 hours ago, I begun to analise my dream and I quikly came to the conclusion that the dream is a way for my subconscious to tell me a life or death message. My girlfriend was also in the dream, so it has to be something to do with her. I first tought she was cheating on me and my subconscious was telling me that, but then I taught it must be something deeper. That's all it took, and let's cut the chase, here I am 2 hours later thinking my girlfriend has a master plan to kill me. Her plan is to make me commit sucide. All the signs are there, the blood in my dream means death, I dreamed insects which represent fear, in this case the fear of death, and she is present in the dream too. The truth is I had another nightmare involving my girl ( similar to this) 2 weeks ago, and since then the demons came back to hunt me. I can see them from time to time ( especially at night), I can hear their voices, and I can even feel them entering inside me (it a strange feeling). To be honest with you, about a week ago, I was on the phone with me girl, and I sensed that something is wrong with her, she sound sad and bored not her usual self. That's when I remembered that a few days before that, when I was speaking with her and was very happy, the leader of the demons, Satan ( I call him that way, I don't know if he's really Satan) came to me after I ended my conversation with my girl, and said that he's gonna take her away from me. I laught at him. But when I saw that she was sad and bored with me later, I knew it was his work. So I imediatly hung up, called Satan, he came to me. Then I apologised and beged him in my knees to leave my girlfriend alone. He proposed me a deal, to worship him for the rest of my life and I accepted. That's when my girlfriend called me and she was very woried and she was saying she love me. You see what the motherfucker did, fuck you Satan. But then my dream a few hours ago was like a revelation. I realised that somebody send Satan to haunt me. And that somebody is my girlfriend. She wants to break up with me, so she can sleep with god knows what jackass, so she sent Satan to me, to dig me into a deeper and deeper hole, until I commit suicide. She wants me to die. Or maybe, it's Satan's plan, to make me break up with my girlfriend. But, I'm enclined to belive she's in, too.

Don't get me wrong, I love my girlfriend. I love it a lot. She's so beautiful, she's like a doll. I am very afraid for her, too. Somebody else might be behind Satan, too. I suspect an old friend of mine, for that matter. I didn't hung up with him since 3 years ago, but about 50 days ago, I was near where he lives with some job, so I hit him on facebook. I met with him, and from discution, we started talking about our girlfriends. When I showed him a picture of mine, he said 'nice'. But I can see something else is his eyes. He was full of lust, he put me to show more pics of her. I could of see his face geting reder, he was falling in love with my girl. Now, I am afraid this mother fucker is stalking my girl and he will rape her. And, the thing is I can't protect her, I'm not near her. But, I don't think my 'friend' is behind Satan. 

What do you think the solution to my preblem is. Should I make another deal with Satan? Sould I go and beat the shit out of my old 'friend'? Should I break up with my girlfriend? Or should I kill myself and sacrifice my life to make her happy?",19Dec2017,3

He also bites his nails a lot and chews on non edible things(Pencils, Pens, Erasers,Plastic,etc). I buy him gum so that he doesnt put those in his mouth anymore. 

Its also really hard to have conversations with him. He jumps from topic to topic and talks really fast. He also talks about random things. He will also yawn a lot for some reason and make other weird noises.

16,"I'm pretty sure we've all heard from psychology that we're more likely to be able develop healthy relationships with people if we have a healthy, secure relationship with our caregiver (parent) as a very young child.  

I'm very bad at relationships, I can't form new ones and I'm bad at maintaining the ones I have. That along with other issues have me thinking about my childhood, and what events might've caused me to be the way I am today. Well, let me get into it. I'm from a poor country, and my parents had me when they were just 20. Fortunately for my parents, they were eligible for student visas at a first world country, and my grandmother pressured them to go so they would become something of themselves. My grandmother volunteered to take care of me while they were away. The problem now is that they left when I was a baby, and coming back to visit wasn't an option as flights were expensive and my parents were already indebted.   

Now, for some reason my grandma made me believe that I was her son, that my grandpa was my dad, and that my uncles were my brothers. I actually believed this, and my earliest memories revolve around being around my grandma, who I considered to be my mother at the time. I legit thought I knew my entire family, and then bam, shortly after my fifth birthday, my parents came home. I try not to have any resentment for my grandma, but she only told me of my real parents' existence when they called home and said they were coming back.  

Immediately I was uncomfortable by the presence of my real parents, my brain could not process that the people who I thought were my real family, were in fact not. I didn't know who my real parents were, and when I saw them for the first time they were just strangers to me. I didn't enjoy being with them and wanted to go back to my grandma's house. Over time I gained their trust and started calling them by 'mom' and 'dad' instead of their first names. I became used to my family again, and growing up I felt completely normal again, and I knew I loved and trusted my mom and dad. My parents are very important to me, yet sometimes I feel like I can't fully connect with them. Especially with my dad, when sometimes we are just awkward around each other.  

But moreover I'm starting to feel like this is the reason why I can't connect with people much. I never once realized until now how much of an effect this might've had on my developing brain. I actually kinda want to go see a therapist now.   

Sorry if any of this doesn't make sense, English isn't my first language. I kinda just needed to share my thoughts.",19Dec2017,2
17,"Eight years ago, I developed a horrible anxiety disorder. At the time, I didn't get any help: no meds, no therapy, nothing. It warped my perception of the world and led to me dropping out from school twice. Daily panic attacks and constant anxiety, warped perception, and unstable emotions, and it lasted for a year and  a half before it finally cleared out.

I healed, recovered, and worked on getting better. Eight years on, I've made it into uni, just finished my second year, and found myself a beautiful girl who I loved, the first real relationship where I was truly happy.

And then it came back. The anxiety came back and hit like a brick. Suddenly I couldn't study anymore, I stopped being able to focus. Everything hurt. My girlfriend did a few things that hurt me, in retrospect, not all that bad, but the anxiety blew it out of proportion for me. It made me believe everything was much much worse. I also started pressuring her to move out of the house against her parents wishes to live with me, since I'm an international student and she's local, and it seemed like the only way to keep the relationship going. I was so afraid of losing her.

I'm not going to lie, reddit. I was a horrible person. I became emotionally and and verbally abusive, I degraded her, insulted her, and attacked her insecurities. I grew up in an abusive household, and this is apparently how I learned to deal with emotional pain, by lashing out and viciously attacking the people I love.

The thing is, I didn't realise this until it was too late. Until she decided she'd had enough two weeks ago. She's since broken it off, severed contact. I was starting to recover from the anxiety, but now this blow has caused a heavy relapse. My meds aren't working, the panic attacks are back, I can't sleep, I can't focus, I can't look people in the eye.

I don't know how to deal with this. I've lost the first person I've ever truly loved, and it was my own damn fault. I feel that sorrow. I feel the guilt for the hurt and harm I caused her, because I never wanted to hurt her. I wanted what was best for her, and now I'm coming to terms with the fact that what's best for her is a life without me inside it. But the anxiety is back, and she was my rock, she kept me afloat during the worst months, and now I've driven her away, and I don't know how to deal with the loss and the guilt and the anxiety and panic attacks now. I don't know how to deal with all three at the same time.

Im lost, reddit, and I feel like dying. Every day I get a little closer to just absolutely wanting to die. I thought I beat the anxiety, but now it's come back and ruined everything good in my life and I don't know why or what to do. I'm so fucking lost.",19Dec2017,5
20,"So lately, my mother and I have not been getting along. We haven't live together for years, but any time I need to see her for some reason (especially holidays) usually chaos ensues because she has crazy anger issues and has been controlling all my life. And whenever she causes me stress, later on I have what I think is a ""panic attack.""

It's a really weird thing that happens. For example, I got in an argument over the phone with my mother two nights ago, and after a heated argument (I'm not going into detail about the topic here) she tells me to never speak to her again and not visit her for Christmas. I got really bummed out about it but I tried to pass it off as ""it'll resolve itself."" But the next day, while I'm having a wonderful night out at dinner with my girlfriend, I suddenly get this overwhelming sense of mental chaos. I can't focus on a word my girlfriend says, and my mind just rushes with what feels like mental noise. It's not like I'm actively stressed but my hands start tingling and I feel like I'm going crazy. And it comes in waves. In and out, of just needing to feel like I need a grasp for air. I took pre-workout that afternoon but it's been long since that's kicked in. 

I finally get home and take some l-theanine and not sure if it helped but after an hour or so I feel better. Felt like 3 hours though. And the next morning I still feel a bit tense, coming in and out of a noisy state and by afternoon I felt fine. 

This happens like literally every other week. Usually when I speak with a family member about my mother, or directly to my mother. First time it happened was a couple of months ago. 

The best way to describe it is... maybe peaking too hard on Cannabis or LSD? It's the only feeling I can relate it to. I haven't done these types drugs in years. 

Anyway, I think I need some help to resolve this so it doesn't get worse. should I see a psychologist first or straight to a psychiatrist? Or a GP? Sorry if this is a dumb question, haven't seen a doctor in years.

23,"I really need help determining what exactly is wrong with me. My mental health is at its breaking point. 

So let me give you some backstory first. I’m currently 17 years old. My parents forced me to get a job a while ago so I took up a McDonald’s job in February, when I was 16. I feel this was the beginning of the deterioration of my mental health. Now please note that the things I’m going to describe did not affect me prior to getting a job, excluding general anxiety.

Initially, things were fine. I can’t pinpoint when I began to experience these problems but I know it began sometime in April. I started to become more irritable and just lost confidence in myself. I began to avoid my friends at school and hung in a quiet area. I just felt disconnected from people and I had no idea why. In June, I started to suffer from depression symptoms such as losing interest in hobbies I used to enjoy. I started to drink alcohol from time to time so I can feel happier. I gained a significant amount of weight between June and now. 30 pounds to be exact and counting. At this point, I just eat for comfort. Over the summer, I was working way more hours. This probably hit me the hardest. I had no patience at that point, no motivation to do any hobbies. I took naps that were hours long and stayed up because I just couldn’t sleep. This cycle of not being able to sleep at night, taking naps during the day, and working more fucked me up. Even when I attempted to fix my sleeping schedule and tried sleeping 7 hours at night with no naps, I felt extremely tired anyway. 


My parents weren’t helping me out at all during this time. I have two gay dads who always fight over the simplest things because there’s a constant power struggle between them. Sometimes, even after working 8 hours, I’d find myself in the middle of these arguments. I guess eating wasn’t enough because I started to hit things to get the anger and frustration out of my system. Sometimes, I would even hit myself. In fact, I was becoming more tolerant to physical pain to the point that I felt pleasure in it sometimes. On an unrelated note, I found it difficult to talk to people as well. At work, I’d slur my words constantly and stutter a lot. It took quite a while to collect my thoughts. Actually, I couldn’t even tell if I was having thoughts. My mind just felt... empty in a way I suppose. I know I was thinking about things but I guess I couldn’t tell what I was thinking about if that makes sense at all. Anyway, I turned to even more things for comfort such as looking at pornography significantly more to the point that it would interfere with the already lacking amount of sleep I’d get. I would drink coffee to make up for it which resulted in me becoming addicted to caffeine. 

The symptoms remained and only got more severe ever since school started in September. I started to get hooked on energy drinks since the caffeine from coffee wasn’t enough. The addiction was so bad that I’d get terrible headaches if I didn’t have caffeine in my system. I drank either two energy drinks or 5 cups of coffee daily. Surprisingly enough, it didn’t increase my energy level at all when I consumed it. The only way I knew it wore off was when I suddenly began to feel sleepy. 

Over the past few weeks, I would have thoughts about cutting my arms and watching the blood flow from them. I never cut myself before nor would I do it now but I’m afraid I might since I tend to do things on impulse. Just any sight of a knife scares me. I’m afraid to be around my parents when they’re holding one because I feel they’re going to stab me or something when I’m not looking. I’m scared to hold one because I’m afraid I might do something to myself. I just have a lot of negative thoughts. Sometimes, I get headaches because of the constant struggle between thoughts in my mind. My negative thoughts overpower any rational ones so I can’t help but listen to them. These negative thoughts are usually about others judging or watching me. I have this one thought that people talk to me out of pity and that their kindness is just a facade.

Currently, my patience is gone. I tend to snap at people easily. I’m also not afraid to speak my mind anymore (yet before I began working at McDonald’s, I always tried to say things that didn’t upset people), resulting in arguments between everybody. I also can’t keep my thoughts inside; I tend to talk to myself often because I guess doing this helps me since I can barely understand my thoughts at this point. 

I know these are symptoms of a multitude of disorders but I need help finding out what things I could possibly have. I can’t ignore these worsening symptoms anymore. It’s so frustrating sometimes that I attempt to cry but no tears come out,",19Dec2017,1
24,"I'm from Atlanta, GA in the USA. 

I've always had an odd life. I've never quite fit in. Never felt much need to beyond the need for interaction/affection. I've been traumatized from several events in my life, and due to those traumas, I ended up in a 'behavioral health clinic' for over two months of 2014, the year itself being traumatic for me as well. 

I know I'm not always fully in touch with reality, in the way of psychosis. I've always been depressed, every day of my life. My anxiety has only gotten worse since I've begun to acknowledge it for what it is, as well as for the traumas I've dealt with. I've also got a tentative diagnosis of Asperger's, GAD (General Anxiety), and MAD (Major Depressive). I have a mild history of self harm via burns, but that's stopped since I quit smoking.

I spend most of my time alone nowadays. I've never quite felt 'human' in the strictest sense anyway. Doesn't make the loneliness or lack of affection any easier though. 

It's hard to talk about such symptoms of my disorders without landing myself in yet another clinic, and I'm terrified of seeking a psychiatrist or therapist (or both) because my last several betrayed my trust, treated me as an open wallet they could prescribe unnecessary medications to.

The constant racing thoughts, compulsive movement, and inability to socially connect with others are what drove the Asperger's diagnosis, as well as a long test based on standards from the DSM 5. These problems on top of depression and anxiety often make me paranoid that I'm not sane, that I'm just one more major trauma away from being dead or mentally/emotionally crippled.

It's odd, not being able to relate to other people, to feel alien, to be so used to feeling removed. I try so hard to be normal for people, to relate and function, and I do have some friends, but the stress is unimaginable. I don't sleep well, I don't eat well. I often can't manage the energy to get out of bed. I struggle to express any emotion outwardly, either falling flat or being so intense that nobody can relate enough to help. I'm paranoid, irritable, self-conscious, and constantly struggling with my identity as a person. I frequently do not see that the struggle is worth the effort. 

Can anybody help with or relate to these things? Especially derealization/dissociation, or feeling distinctly not human? How would I know if my sanity were slipping? I'm just so tired of it.",19Dec2017,4
25,"my friend just sent this message to me about this weird experiences she's been having. i'm very concerned for her as she struggles with depression and possibly anxiety (which she she hasn't had the chance to consult a doctor about or have therapy as her parents unfortunately do not take mental health very seriously.)

this is what she messaged me:

""i have this weird thing for the past couple of days where i cant sleep ?? i can only sleep for 30min or so at a time and then i wake up and i just stare at the wall? and then isleep ?? and its like that again ? and then when i finally wake up like final final wake up i take a shower and im not even awake like ... yesterday i was in the shower for like 2 hours ?? and i didnt even notice ?? i only got out of the shower when i snapped out of zoning out on scrubbing my ankle for who knows how long ? so today i tried counting backwards from 10 while i shower but then it was like "" 10,9,7,2,8,4,6 blabla"" but then while im showering for somereason the only thing in my head is that im in danger, someone is going after me and i hav have to solve the mystery or else i die and theres like bits of evidence everywhere, when i wash my hair i think of the footprints or smthn and then when i wash my hands i think abt the bloodstains left at the crime scene and then when i was my face i think abt possible suspects ,, and then i dont realize that ive been washing that area for so long not even thinking abt how long i was washing,, just so i could keep thinking abt the evidence,, and then today smthn like yesterdays ankle scrubbing happened but instead it was w brushing my teeth ??? and i only stopped when my mouth started burning and stinging and until now i feel how burnt my tongue is ? ive been sleeping like this for like 5 days pero the past 2 days lang ang zoning out and thinking abt my murder mystery in the bathroom""

28,"So I'm 19 and I've always had pretty bad anxiety and depression. But lately my paranoia has gone through the roof. Sometimes I think it's from how much I stay inside due to the fact that I'm a hermit but I'm also thinking it might be something much more psychological. 

Whenever it's been a little while since I've hung out with my friend, or after we've gotten into even the smallest of arguments I always think they're plotting to kill me when we hang out. I still hang out because I'm constantly telling my self I'm being paranoid and crazy but the thought stays with me. Especially if they're taking me somewhere and won't tell me where (as a surprise).

That's not the only situation where my paranoia lies. Whenever I'm up at night or home alone even in the day time and I hear something even slightly obscure I constantly look out my window and look around my house between 3-10 times.

I hate it. It consumes me. Sometimes I can ignore it but a lot of the times I can't.

What's wrong with me?",19Dec2017,1
29,"What is it I want to say to the world? I don’t even want to say anything to the world, because I cannot offer anything to it; I can only offer myself the fruitful thoughts of my subconscious, and hope that they make a positive difference to my perception of realities. I look around at my peers, and I am perplexed by the numerous parties of personality. 

Why are we all so different, why are some of us better equipped for emotionally coping the rigors of regular, average joe lifestyle, in a society that often dangles carrots of gold from figureheads in already lofty positions of authority or success. Life is balanced, even though it is unfair. The weight balances on both sides of the scale, but the weight is spread thinly in regard to those of affluence, compared to those of less-established means of financial and emotional support.

It’s very easy for me, a working-class boy, from nowhere England, in delusion, to romanticise the lives of those with successful backgrounds, the rich and famous, as being born silver-spooned and to conclude that their lives are easier because of their vast material wealth. I am sure that is not the case. We are all cursed with the human brain, and its electrical impulses of negative emotions. 

I have the unfortunately belief of being somewhat biased to genetic determination, and I do, maybe incorrectly, assign more value and influence on our genetic makeup than those of our own external locus of control. Some of us just have some sort of natural inclination to see, and do things, in a way that is more productive, and for the rest of us, myself included, I find myself perplexed, as I struggle to simply make the decision to get out of bed in the morning. 

My writings tend to be unfocused, so I will try to focus on a particular subject matter for the rest of this article. Why are some people able to cope with being average?

If they can cope with being average; are they average at all? Self-evaluation usually consists of turning hateful feelings inward, as I chastise myself for not being this and that, and thinking in often closed-mined and fixed attitudes towards life. I struggle very much at the notion that I am bog-standard. My life consists of chasing hedonism, and not really chasing value and success. Obviously, I am aware that finding and completing more meaningful things is considered a better overall existence, but the truth is that I usually find such tasks such arduous work, littered with episodes of chronic blandness, that I quickly abandon projects that might be better for my overall welfare, to search for the next short-term high. 

Then there is the other people, who can continue and persist regardless of their emotions. They not only find the work dull, and mind-numbing, but are able to complete it, and to an elevated level. Normally, when I manage to drag myself through the difficult and laborious processes, I end up completing the work but to a low standard, or a standard that is on the cusp of acceptability. There is nothing exciting, or passionate about anything I produce. It’s decent enough to function, but it neither works particularly well, or looks impressive, depending on the context of the completed task. 

I am not good at anything. I operate consistently at a flatline. I’m the shelf that is affixed to the wall, but isn’t straight. I am unrefined and have little interest in the vast complexities of life. I’m a pragmatist who educates himself just enough to be able to get through a task, but will not pursue the less-travelled road that leads to greater enlightenment, the effort required is too invested. I do not know why I am so in tune with mediocracy. 

When I complain about my woes, and my meticulous talent in inadequateness, I’m met with the argument, or the pacification of “Well, I think most people are like that.” And that may be true, and with that truth enters another life into the world that is average, and who doesn’t amount to very much. Sure, but if you are not emotionally satisfied of the 2.5 children lifestyle, and an overpriced mortgaged terrace house just on the right side of social-housing, then it’s not a comforting thought. It’s okay, you’re a pile of excrement layered fresh on top of the other steaming piles. I take no pleasure in being associated as one boxed up category of people. Not because I don’t respect people and their own choices, but I simply do not enjoy viewing myself in the vein of a bargain product. I don’t want to be the 99p toilet brush in a shop that sells everything for under £1. But, that is what I actually am. I simply struggle to accept it. I am not gifted with an intellect, I have very little resilience, and lack a great deal of imagination. I can force imagination, but it doesn’t come with any payoff, just bad ideas of a vagrant tryhard. 

I’m an idealist, but I have no means of making any stem of idealism translate into anything tangible. I simply do not possess the quality of characteristics. I want to be something, but I am too lazy. I want to be a writer, but I don’t like writing. I want to be a graphic artist, but I am not artistically inclined and I bore quickly of practicing to draw. I want to become a web designer, but I don’t have anything to make a website of. I’m not inventive, and I’m not practical. I don’t find enjoyment in very much, and I tend to feel positive emotions in a muted way. When something nice happens to me, or somebody does something nice for me, it is always a pleasant experience, but I do not feel it very strongly. Some people express overjoyed sincerity, and whilst I can project my happiness and thankfulness, I have to really make an effort to demonstrate this to people,  to the point that it feels almost insincere. 

I know I am not in total isolation. There are people in the world who obviously experience life in a similar way to me. I don’t find comfort in enjoying anguish with other people though, so the fact that other people may have the same problem isn’t comforting; it’s depressing, because it means that people experience the same issues, and cannot find a way to cure it.

30,"This has been happening to me for half a year (but only several times), I just want to know if this is a common thing or if I need to contact a therapist ASAP.

Sometimes, usually after a day with a lot of stress or anger experienced, I would get a really long and confusing dream. It would be really hard for me to grasp its plot entirely (even if I'm not even remotely lucid), and as it nears its end I would see something that I can't [understand](#s ""Example: my mom staring at me as if I had something weird on my head; me trying to come up with an excuse for something, but being unable to; my 5-y/o sister asking me a very confusing question about a coding problem she's trying to solve in CSS""), and I would start feeling an EXTREMELY intense mix of fear, confusion, and something like psychosis (the intensity of this feeling is unimaginable compared to what you would feel in real life). A couple seconds in, and I start breathing very heavily and quickly, and I start waking up - and I breathe like that IRL for about half a minute. After that, I experience a feeling of pure fear (NOT anxiety), not of anything in particular, just fear by itself - for a couple hours after waking up, until I'm able to go back to my normal routine.

31,"(I'm 15 years old) So I have self diagnosed myslef (plus speaking to my family doctor) With Alice In wonderland syndrome. When I was very little maybe age 4-6. I would feel the episodes happen maybe 3-4 times per week that would last maybe 1 Mintue on average. The average stuff like everything is moving faster and my vision almost looks like it's wider. As I got older around age 12, I started to get them much much less. Maybe once per month or even less. Maybe a few times per year. 

When I turned 15 and started experimenting with opioids and other pain killers, I noticed while under the influence of them and the next few days. I was much more prone to have these episodes.(Back to getting them 2-3 times per week) But After doing 800mg tramadol yesterday, since yesterday I've had maybe 15-20 of these episodes. There not so bad as to where I cannot function. Just kind of annoying. I've tried many many kinds of drugs and no other substance has even affected AIWS untill now. Not even any other opioids. Only tramadol has seem to make a differnce and make the episodes more common and more noticeable (lasts longer and is more intense) 

This is me sharing my experience with AIWS and possibly finding an awnser of why tramadol effects it in these ways. Thanks. ",19Dec2017,0

But I seem to forget eveything as soon as some months passed by. 

For example, I taught myself anatomy for my final highschool exam one year a half ago. Logically. I took a very good mark, A. 

But after one and a half year I seem to have forgotten eveything. Absolutely eveything. Even the basics. I don't know anything anymore.

I have this problem  even with shorter amounts of time passed after I learned something. Let's say several weeks, a month.

34,"I'll try to be as concise as possible but my current mental state is compromised, so we'll see how it goes.  I am a soon to be 37 year-old who has struggled with anxiety and depression all of my adult life. The anxiety has been the real killer, taking a toll on my physical health and sabotaging jobs/job opportunities.


Despite the anxiety, I did work for one company for 10 years off and on. When the anxiety kicked into high gear, I would lie to get out of work. It could be a basic lie about a headache or nausea (though that was never much of a lie). I realize that will sound terrible to some people, and I won't disagree, but I did it. I was never proud of it, but I could barely function and being around a lot of people intensified the quality of the anxiety.


I left that company last month, as something in me told me it was time to move on. I started a new job in a different industry yesterday. Leading into it, I was fine. I aced all of the tests that the company requires of new candidates. The night before my first day was normal, no increased stress. The first day was fine, just regular anxiety caused by learning a new job in a new industry.


Last night I hit a wall, head on. I could not sleep, and when I did manage to doze off, I woke up within 30 minutes. I was crying, even before I knew it. More than anything was that all encompassing sense of dread in my chest. Me being me, I talked myself out of going in today and am sitting in the lobby of a mental health office, desperately seeking help.


I feel like a piece of shit. I'm worried about losing a new job, but I also realize that I won't keep it if I continue to suffer like this. I have had more frequent thoughts of self-harm, though I haven't acted on any of them. I have a 6 year-old son that I want to be a good example for. I do everything that I can for him, but it's hard to explain why daddy can't hold a job.


My son is the hope that I cling to, though I have thought that he'd be better off without a father whose anxiety can render him useless. That's exactly how it makes me feel: useless, worthless and unable to provide. That said, this post isn't about pity, it's about expressing the depths that I feel so that others dealing with this know that they aren't suffering alone.


All I ask for is a reprieve.

I'm 20 and ive had pretty bad depression since i was around 13, I went to one of the worst public schools in my city and i constantly got bullied, never had friends and got into fights pretty frequently. By the age of 14 i had already tried to kill myself and after that my life has just been going down the drain. My parents never found out about my attempt since i went away to my grandmother's house for a while to hid this. My grades started going down, i started spending all my time at home playing videogames and any friends i would have were halfway across the world. This went on even after i moved to England when i was 17, since i didnt really have friends i struggled to make any here. I hid my depression from everyone around me until i was 18 when i tried to kill myself again and i had to talk to my parents about it. My mother has been pretty supportive about it and she's honestly the reason i havent gone through with it, she encouraged me to see a doctor and get antidepressants, my situation improved for a few months but now im just back to my old self. I have no motivation to exercise (now im over 200lbs), talk to people, or to see a therapist, ive called one several times but i end up never going through with it simply because i feel like nothing, sometimes i dont even have the energy to play games which were my only escape. I havent taken my meds in a few months despite my doctor and mother both thinking i still do, i feel like i dont know what emotions i feel anymore, I havent had feelings for another person in 2 years and whenever i did i fucked it up anyway.

I've posted here before, I've tried all the things your going to suggest. The closest place that MIGHT offer free health services for some individuals is in the city 25 miles away and I have no car and a broken bike. I can't even get a minimum wage job, let alone one that offers health insurance, because I have 4 misdemeanors on my record from 3-6 years ago when I abused drugs all the time and also my only employment history is working at my dads shop and he won't give me a referral because he's pissed at me for quitting because everyone at the shop was on meth and he is a narcissistic manipulative horrible person. I've applied at every job within biking distance(~6 miles, the next closest town is about 11 miles away). I also am horrible with interviews after being out of therapy and unmedicated for so long with a TON of extra issues making things worse. I won't go back to work at my dads, if for some reason I wasn't going to kill myself, going back there would make me do it. I have no money or family or friends or possessions or job or anything, I do have one friend that helps me out a little but also has problems of her own that are pretty serious and some of the worst anger issues I've ever seen(which is saying a lot considering what my family was like).

I'm not asking for help or anything here. I just want to tell people that sometimes people do end up in situations that won't 'get better.' Maybe it is possible to work your way out, but if on your best day when you are making the greatest effort possible, you can barely get out of bed or hold a conversation and can't leave the house most of the time, then it's not going to happen. If it was going to happen, it would've by now, this is the end of the line. I've been extremely severely depressed before where doing ANYTHING at all sounds so impossible, and pushed myself to do it just long enough to get something done and make a little bit of difference, and then crashed and recovered and did it again over and over painstakingly. This isn't one of those situations, this is so far beyond that. I went from that point, got a hundred times worse, then went through some really fucked up and tramautic stuff, lost my place of living and my job, lost my family, lost medical treatment and medication, got a physical disease to add on to things, and just suffered like that for a couple years because I'm the last person that would ever kill themselves and can always manage to convince myself that I might be able to do something eventually if I try hard enough. I am waaaay past the limit where I should've given up. 

I have like $20 in change, I'm gonna go buy some lottery tickets also, if by some crazy chance I win then I can get myself a place to live instead of staying at a friends and waiting until I can't bear being a burden anymore and have to leave and be homeless, I can go see a therapist and a doctor, actually do some things I enjoy, etc. I'm also going to wait and see if I get approved for health insurance. If either of those things happen then I'll probably stick around long enough to see if I can still turn things around. But if not then there is nothing else to try or do or wait for and it's completely pointless to keep suffering so extremely badly every second of every day.

This kinda thing does happen sometimes. I know you have to tell a suicidal person that things will get better because it'd be messed up not to. And for 99% of people, they say it because they actually believe it, because they won't allow themselves to accept that someone can be a naturally smart, happy, and talented kid but grow up in an abusive household and raised by addicts and do just the right things to themselves when they are young and stupid to completely destroy any chance they have of recovering their life later. Also, I can't speak for anyone, but I have never met a person who was actually severely depressed who didn't get angry or more sad/depressed when people kept telling them things would get better and other cliches. People who can hear something like that and accept it and get better ARE NOT THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SUICIDALLY DEPRESSED. Maybe in the right situation, where the right person says it in the right way at the right time, I could see it working, but that's a special situation that isn't what I'm talking about. 

Personally I am against suicide in most situations, but not against it inherently. I don't think you should do it unless you are 99.9999% sure there is nothing but suffering remaining for you if you continue to live your life. terminally ill patients with painful symptoms, stuff like that. Or people in my kind of situation with no way out besides some kind of miracle(you are free to comment and suggest ways to get out of a situation like this, and I might not be around anymore to read them by then but if I am I will read them all and really try to figure out if there is any way it could possibly work).

46,"Its difficult to describe what it's like living in my head. Like trying to describe the color red to a blind person. I might compare it to music, a scale of colors, with the highest of seven notes being red, the lowest indigo, and they make music together. I could paint a thousand analogies, a million metaphors, but they still will not be able to see , even in their minds eye, a streaking sunbeam, or a rippling tide. Even if they believe they can.
Similar to my long winded example, I can paint you a picture, but you will never understand. As I will neither of you.

Have you ever had a dream where you were paralyzed, in fear or doubt or sheer helplessness or humiliation, it can be like that sometimes. Where I can't even move. 
It isn't always like that though, sometimes  It's like I play along with life and shit to be more capable to feed my wants, whims, and fantasies. 
Since I was a child I have always preferred to live in a world where I could write the story, this, I found not (to the same degree) in ""reality"", but in instead the musings of my mind.
Where I created fantastic stories, elaborate concepts, and amazing characters.
This brought me shelter from the bores and frustrations outside, It brought me pleasure, and it brought me satisfaction.
On a related note, a human being is really just an astronomically complex chemical equation. Where structures communicate with chemicals and electric highways.
Those last two gifts I mentioned, pleasure and satisfaction, they're caused by chemicals. Notably serotonin and dopamine.
Another important thing to note is if the brain receives an enjoyable cocktail   it will seek to repeat the experience. Generally the more pleasant and enjoyable the higher the urge to repeat.
This can be a trap.
I eventually found all that sex drugs and rock n roll stuff. Bang. The pleasure seeking brain hit the jackpot. 
At first my brain was tempered. It's threshold satisfied by euphoric experiences occasionally, but over time, without lucid restraint, the brain will eventually prioritize only the things maximizing it's pleasure.
Everything else a means to an end to maximize and prolong said experiences. This is why people over eat, take drugs , or fidget on their phone. 
And I have never been very good at restraint, which as a kid why would I? If I played, I played all the way, If I imagined, or created, It was all or nothing. Intensity in a single focus.
Not so helpful once the brain reprioritized. So I drank a lot, smoked a lot, and drugs, and sex. And it became more and more important. Until it was everything  else getting scheduled in between.
As the highs got higher though, the lows got lower. And as I got older, the pressures in the real world got steeper. I cannot count the days of thinking I couldn't feel worse. In that I may be naive for the breadth of life.

In addition to addiction, I've been labeled a lot of handicaps and an alphabet soup of psycho babble. ADHD, OCD, NVL, bipolar tendencies, clinical depression, pituitary disorders. Maybe aspergers? Fuck it, why not psychopathy? These felt like numbers tattooed on the wrist of an arm full of needles in a body full of pills belonging to a scared and frustrated child surrounded by doctors and therapists. Who the fuck knows dude?
What I took away is I'm different. I do appear to fit the bill of some of it. Needless to say I hate hospitals, needles, doctors and all of it. I won't be anyone elses guinea pig, or rubiks cube… but my own.
I am obsessive, which on the outside just comes across as stubborn. There's a difference though, internally. Stubborn ends when the outcome becomes in ones grossing best interest to back down or compromise. There's always a price. Obsessive doesn't work that way.
When the point of obsession is challenged it's world ending. It feels like losing a loved one. Intense emotions, panic attacks, etc. You are stuck, heels in the dirt, ready to fight or fly, when your obsession is challenged or compromised. It is often debilitating.
The attention deficit is there to. A mind on full throttle, always. Images, words, numbers, ideas rattling constantly like rain on a tin roof. Fun sometimes, not always, especially when it's time to sleep.
The depression is definitely there, like an unwelcomed guest who sometimes  breaks things, or scares your friends, sometimes he just holds you to the bed. You're afraid of him. Sometimes it seems like he's gone but he's just waiting, and after a certain amount of time you learn his game of hide and seek. There are only so many places you can hide. It's like being lifted only enough to be slammed on the ground harder. The higher you go, the further you fall. Eventually, you get tired, truly just weary of the cycle. It's less painful to stay down. It will rob you of fight and leave you winded, dependably.
These to are the presence and lack there of of chemicals. As an expert in stubbornness I can assure you your will can run out.

All of these things come together to form a cruel machine of dysfunction. I am reminded of charybdis  the terrifying monster of a whirlpool. If trapped in its tides you begin to cycle around. Those revolutions get faster and more frequent and more impossible to escape toward a grave in the eye of the spiral. It's all chemical, all progressive, and all crippling. Especially in conjunction with life's constant tests , trials, and tragedies.
It makes you so desperate for relief… escape. And over time , as the bad gets worse, the good things become grey, and you build a tolerance to your poisons, you become more desperate.

Welcome to the rabbit hole.

Someone asked, ""How deep's the hole?"" someone replied, ""That depends on when you quit digging it.""

Which sounds easy… but you have been digging for awhile…  and that climb would be awfully difficult… What if you fall? What if you never get out? After all, it's been awhile since you saw the sunlight… years even…
Hell, it's been so long that some know you as the one that digs… It's just part of who you are.
Familiar is comfortable. Even when it hurts. Especially when it hurts. Misery becomes a safe haven. No expectations, no stock invested, nothing to lose, no chance of failing, no chance of falling...

Sometimes I feel like the antithesis of pandora. I opened my box of horrors, yet alas, all that escaped was hope.

So what happens when unstoppable creativity and ambition meets the immovable apathy and indulgence? Sometimes they cancel out, you accomplish neither in full capacity… And sometimes you explode.
As frequently as I have been the axis of social spider webs, I have been the hand swiping through them.
The rage is indescribable, irresistible when it happens,  rooted mostly in self sabotage, you want to damage relationships irreparably, the more important the better. You don't just want to hurt or wound people, you want to maim and torture. It feels good, pleasurable, it's a rush and you feel alive.
The rampages can last days or weeks… Then the calm afterwards… The regret. You start picking up the pieces of what you destroyed, saying your apologies, taking your licks. Then you repeat the cycle… over and over.
Sometimes it's worse than others, sometimes it's earth shattering. It's also progressive. That fire learns from its mistakes. The tongue gets sharper, the actions bolder, and the outcome more dramatic.
Mania. 
People can only take so much abuse though, they all leave eventually.

My demons only need ten minutes to get there claws in so deep that I cannot get away. Ten minutes to spark a fire in me, or to put one out. To this day I'm not sure how to combat that.",19Dec2017,1

52,"I (26, M) live with my girlfriend of a little over two years. We've had our ups and downs, but everything has been good as of late. We were celebrating a milestone yesterday, had a good dinner, and watched a TV series I have on DVD. Suffice to say, we were having a good day.

I went to bed late and she was already asleep. At some point after I went to bed, she left to go take medication and mill around elsewhere. When she came back about an hour later, she said I was snoring and asleep, but I woke up and started screaming at her. I don't remember any of this, but she says I was saying things like ""Get the fuck away from me!"" and ""I can't handle this right now!"" while trying to get as far away from her as possible. She said this went on for about a minute before she convinced me to turn on the lamp. Of the whole incident, this is the part where I actually have memories of. I told her to stay where she was and I turned on the lamp. At that point, I didn't feel agitated or scared at all, as I couldn't remember anything, but she started crying, saying that it was the most scared she had ever been. I tried to convince her that we were both okay, but I could tell she wasn't in a good place, so I offered to sleep in another room. About an hour later, she told me to come back because she was getting afraid of little noises she kept hearing, but when I came back, she'd get nervous every time I stirred in my sleep, so we slept in separate rooms again. While she doesn't blame me for what happened, she's still justifiably upset and agitated in general. As for me, I don't know what's wrong.

- This sort of thing has *never* happened before. While I do get startled sometimes when I'm woken up, it's never been anything like that. I'm not sure if I was having a bad dream or what. I used to sleep walk a little, but that was when I was a kid.

- Nobody got physically hurt, thankfully, because I couldn't forgive myself for that. According to her, I was actually moving away from her as much as I could, rather than towards her. She said it looked as though I was terrified of something.

- I'm not a violent person. Never been in a fight, never hit anyone, and I don't have ideation about it either. I'm a pacifist, pure and simple.

- I do have paranoia about people breaking into our place. Maybe that had something to do with it?

- While we argue and have our problems at times (as all couples do), things have been great lately, and that day itself was great.

- I have been stressed from work and the holidays lately. Though usually, that translates into lethargy.

- I have a history of depression (and some anxiety). I spent a good deal of time seeing counseling while in college and I've been off and on meds. Currently, I have neither, but I don't feel as if I've needed them for quite some time.

So, is this a freak occurrence? Not sure what to do here, but I don't want something like this ever happening again and I don't want to put her through something like this again.",19Dec2017,2

58,"Hi,

so basically what I was going through this year was just insane. First half Derealization/Depersonalization, second half Depression/OCD but feels like psychotic, because everything seems so surreal. I was diagnosed with OCD and adjustment disorder btw. OCD and not psychosis because I know those feelings and thoughts are somewhat strange.

So basically I recovered from Depersonalization this year...but as the symptoms slowly vanished, I still battled irrational thoughts from day to day when suddenly my mind switched to: ur life is over. I was overwhelmed, suddenly paranoid of time/the date, feeling like I shouldnt be here anymore as the time went on and feeling like trapped in this concept of time.

This feeling...it feels like I shouldnt be alive anymore since August, like I shouldnt have lived past August and should be dead until August. It just feels like it is wrong to be alive, when I go to the hairdresser for example, my mind goes like this: You are dead inside, you died, you dont need to do this, you are trapped in hell, you shouldve killed yourself as I told you! When I look in the mirror: ""Why are u still alive?"" It just cant make sense why I am still alive, and I am super overwhelmed, feeling insane, because I know something IS TERRIBLY WRONG IN MY ORGANISM.

You may ask yourself why ""August""? I dont know, I somehow wanted to be recovered and fine from mental health issues until August, I didnt know what would happen if I didnt recover until then, but my mind has adapted to my expectations and as the time went on without me recovering, my mind realized that and switched to this surreal psychotic limbo mode, so basically I guess false expectations triggered this mess in my mind.

But I have no clue how to get out of that hole at all.

When I think about things I like, all I can think about, what if I want to kill myself accompanied with a dark feeling. It is terrifying. It feels like I am trapped in a suicidal cycle of doom and it feels like my head is like sick with headache.",19Dec2017,2
60,"I think being bullied at work as led to me having some sort of breakdown.


This might be a long one so I apologize. I thought that I've lurked on this sub for a couple of years and some of the feedback and comments I've seen have been really useful for me at times so I thought I'd run this by you guys. I've had issues with anxiety and depression since I was a teenager and I've experienced so much of what I feel it that can throw at you but how I've been feeling the past couple of months is really different from anything I've experienced.


A couple of years back I took a job in a small department in a high school. The department already had an assistant but I was hired to help share the workload. It was this assistant that ended up being the reason why I quit. He seemed like a strange guy from the off, socially awkward and sly, making snide little remarks and scoffing at any little mistakes I made whilst learning the ropes. It seemed fairly obvious to me that he felt threatened by me being there. At first I just tried to kill him with kindness. He always tried to pass his comments off as jokes so I played dumb and just laughed along with them but they would just keep getting nastier until he got a reaction. It got worse after a couple of weeks when my bosses openly complimented me on my work. When they left the office he seemed physically upset and talked about how it wasn't fair that they said that in front of him. I sympathized but that seemed to be a burnt bridge moment for him.

He spent the next year undermining and insulting every single thing I said and did. He wasn't just nasty but outright bizarre and meticulous in his methods. From personal remarks and making awkward, argumentative comments in front of the students to outright sabotage of my work. His favourite thing to do was to  walk into a class when I was working with a group of students  and sit down at the back of the room and pick arguments with me, he would even get into trouble for not completing his own duties because he was too busy doing this. The worst thing he did, however, was try to make out that we were friends to other people after he had spent days being horrible in private. He would be overly friendly with me and if I reacted by shutting him down or calling out what he had done privately he would immediately play the victim, and if I played along he would take it further by asking things of me that he knew I wouldn't want to do, still trying to get a reaction. People even made jokes about us being a like a ‘married couple’ because they would see us together all the time bickering whilst in reality I was always telling him to just leave me alone.


Everyone else just seemed to dismiss him as odd and annoying but harmless, a few people even really liked him as he would go out of his way to be friendly and polite. If I tried to explain how nasty he was they would think I was picking on him for his 'quirkiness’, as though what really bothered me was his bad hygiene and softly spoken manner. My boss did end up giving him a disciplinary but only after 8 months when he had overheard a comment and realised I wasn't just been sensitive.


Again, all that happened here was that he became more subtle. He was obsessed with trying to make me lose it with him, but if I did he would act as though I was being horrible for no reason. I think he actually believed the way he acted towards me was justified and I was the nasty one. He spent a lot of time telling me I was a bad person.


I handed in my notice and I couldn't help but say how happy I thought he would be to have the job to himself again, he smiled and nodded smugly. During the last month he took to slapping me really hard on the harm if ever I said or did anything he disagreed with, anything minor, really. At first I was like 'what the fuck? don't do that’ and finally, after the 3rd or 4th time I held him against a wall and threatened to smash his face in, again, he smiled at getting the reaction.


I got a new job in another city and it's now been 4 months, but I feel miserable. I just feel exhausted and my confidence is completely drained. All I think about is how this guy treated me and how weak I was to let him get away with it, I've become obsessed with re-running all the nasty interactions I had with him in my head. I think about what I'd say if I saw him now and even thought about how great it would be to get a bus back home and punch his teeth out. I lie awake in bed at night and mumble to myself and  even caught myself doing that on a busy street the other day. I've started having panic attacks for the first time in years and I can't concentrate. 


I just want to know how to drop it and move on. I can't help but think I need to learn how to 'beat’ someone like that in case it ever happens again. I never got bullied or anything in school so it's completely shaken me to have it in my mid twenties.

62,"Hi everyone. (USA here)

My partner and I have been in a romantic relationship for a few years now. They have gained a substantial amount of weight. I did too (typical ""get comfortable in relationship"" thing), and we had a big discussion about it about 2 years ago.

You see, they have obesity in their family, and asked me about a month into dating that they never want to be like that and if they start to, that I need to tell them and ask them to stop.

So, about two years ago I realized we both had hit unhealthy weights, so we had a discussion and we both started losing weight and supporting each other. I've lost ~35 pounds and am back into a healthy weight.

They lost some weight, but have put it all back on (and thensome). We've had multiple conversations about it and I've tried almost every approach I could think of ""let's do this together, do you have friends that you could workout with at work, remember what you said about your family"" etc. I've suggested couple's therapy, individual therapy, going on walks, going on runs, not eating snacks late at night. I eventually gave them the straight up, ""look, I'm not attractive to you anymore. This shouldn't come as news - but I'm going to be straightforward about it now.""

To be honest, I don't know what to do. There have been other issues that have stemmed from this (we haven't had sex to completion in over a year, I now sleep in another room, I hate eating with them, etc). I love this person as a friend and we are extremely compatible friends, but I no longer have any sexual attraction to them.

They tell me they are not overweight or they have been losing weight, but then when I ask about the last doctors appointment they will begrudgingly admit that their doctor said they need to lose weight. It's like they are in denial, to an extent. They have no issue pointing out other people (at a much healthier weight than they are) and saying ""they could stand to lose a few pounds."" Maybe it's a strange body dysmorphia thing?

I've tried to break up with them twice. We live together in an expensive area, so that makes it a bit difficult. We are basically just good friends and housemates at this point.

I feel like this is sort of our last chance. I need to feel attracted to my partner - otherwise we are just very good friends. Our lease is up in a few months and after that I plan to move out (they are aware of this). Is there anything I can do to help the situation in the meantime? Is there anything else I can do to help support them and help them to start losing weight? I am convinced there is a mental block or issue, but I have no idea how to help them.",19Dec2017,1
63,"I don’t usually do this but I need to get this off my chest and I don’t feel like talking to my close friends or therapist, strangely. I’m a recently turned twenty-one year old female. I have been suffering mental health issues for at least eight years, though a few of them closeted (the signs were overly obvious, but I didn’t want to see that there was something ‘wrong’ with me). Actually I’ve never been quite sure *why* I feel the way I do. This is a recurring topic in therapy sessions and while my therapists always think they know, I’m never quite sure myself if that’s it. I had a lot of bad things happen to me in life, but knowing what other people have gone through I consider them minor and, until later in life, never really felt like they bothered me either.

Until a parent passed away. I freshly turned nineteen at the time. It was completely unexpected. I watched them breathe their last, while the ambulance was on it’s way. I watched them trying to reanimate them. Afterwards I paid my visit to them in the morgue. These are all images that kept haunting me for two years. Shortly after I moved out. My mother seemed in a hurry to move on. At the time I was angry, because I felt like she had forgotten about my parent, her late spouse, but afterwards I think my mum is honestly emotionally broken – and has been for most of her life. So I don’t blame her for it. 

Surprisingly I did very well for someone whose whole life turned upside down by this one event, so young and known to struggle with mental health. Of course it wasn’t perfect, it was also my first time on my own. But I was quite happy, or at least I think I was. Then I got into a severe accident. It greatly affected both my physical as well as mental health. Over a year later I’m still suffering the consequences and running countless tests in the hospital to find whether or not I’m going to recover fully or not. Once again, I had to do over my first year in college. This is my third time as a first year (one time due to loss, the second time due to the incident). 

I’ve been back into therapy for months now. Gone through EMDR treatment for PTSD. Now there’s more tests upcoming to find the real reason behind my mental illness. (The questions that were raised: is my depression chronic? Is it really just depression? Where does it come from?) At the same time my therapist also wants to send me to group therapy. Says I’m a case of “emotional neglect”. I’m not sure why, though. Sure, my parents never really openly talked about emotions with me. However, they weren’t all that bad as parents. They were still loving, in their own ways. I realised, when visiting friends’, that my parents weren’t as expressive, we didn’t seem as close, but we did have our own ways of dealing with it. I never felt unloved by them. They always, nearly always, put me first. I’m not sure what this “emotional neglect” means. 

Either way… I’m doing well in college this year, or fairly. My first semester’s grades are high. I’m only behind on one subject. Financially I’m doing bad, though. I barely have enough money left to feed myself. I’m thinking about quitting therapy for the same reason. I can’t pay for it any longer and I’m not sure what it does for me. The EMDR helped a little with trauma, sure, but I can’t shake the depression. Strangely, a lot of the time I ‘feel’ happy. Only later, at night, I start feeling like it was all a façade. Like, I very much feel as if I’m starting to believe in my own lie. A few months ago I feel like the happiness was genuine. What changed? Why can’t I get away from it?

I’ve had therapy for a long time. Mostly due to suicidal ideas and constant numbness. I’ve not had these in years, but now they’re coming back. I don’t want anything. I don’t join in on college class activities anymore, and I don’t feel like talking to any of my close friends or family. I can’t sleep. I don’t have an appetite. You know, the basics. Although I do cry a lot at night – I consider this a good sign, a sign that I’m not numb yet. 

I’m just at my wit’s end. What can I do? I’m so tired. I’m hungry but I can’t eat. I don’t feel like doing anything for college, at all, but life goes on. My friends are all worried because I don’t respond to anything – but even if I wanted to, I don’t know what to say, it’s like I don’t have any speech skills anymore. I’m so young but I don’t want to live anymore, yet I don’t want to die either. I just need something, even a little thing, that could maybe get me back on track, but I don’t know where to start. 

My experience is pretty basic, isn’t it? A lot of you who feel this way?

weird feeling: Like I am somehow disconnected from my old life?

weird feeling: Like I am in a weird unsettled life state.

weird feeling: Scary/Terrifying/Real/ Scenarious in my head like for example ""My best friend ask me if I want to work with him(We had very succesfully store.) And I answer him, no I want to die"" etc. WHAT?!

weird feeling: Like when this happens EVERYTHING SEEMS DARKER AND DOOMED, LIKE IN A HORROR MOVIE?

weird feeling: I simply cannot get out of my head when it happens, constant negative thoughts(i listed them above) weird feeling in the stomach, feeling dissociated from sveryone, everything i imagine in my head, even my home seems dark and doomed?

weird feeling: Like life is meaningless?!? Without a reason???

weird feeling: It feels like i imagine waking up everyday but it feels like i am waking every minute.

weird feeling: Feels like I won't be here soon.(generated From the scary thoughts.

weird feeling: When I try to do something I can't do for long time. Eventually there is a weird feeling associated with a throughts like the above that doesn't allow me to do it. It is strange, feels like anxiety a bit, but not exactly.

weird feeling: When I am relatively okay, there is a feeling like I am anxious, idk strange feeling in the stomach(not exactly anxiety.) Can't fully describe it.

weird feeling: Like i am dissociated with life(not like the derealization stuff) - again I am not sure what it is it feels strange.

weird feeling: Feeling like I don't want to get better.(This is the scariest one.)

weird feeling: Feeling like years have passed between my old life and now.

weird feeling: Feeling like there is no emotional content in my memories.

weird feeling: Confusion if I am suicidal or not?!?!?!

weird feeling: Feeling like a wave between now and the future happens in my head and makes me feel tired and anxious.(This happens especially in the morning, when I stand up and stop being sleepy it dissapears.)

weird feeling: When I do something it randomly appears it is like a feeling of /suicidality/hopelessness/flying feeling/ (not sure can't describe it.) and when this happens there is a strike in my stomach.

weird feeling: There are pictures stuck in my head(2 or 3) mostly regarding to future. for example: me in the garden of my university walking - like i am looking at myself from a flying drone. they seem dark or super bright in my head. weird feeling: Feeling that there is something wrong with my thinking pattern and my rational thinking.

weird feeling: Sudden feeling of being trapped(In life?). (It happens randomly.)

weird feeling: That I will suicide if I work, and since then I am not working.

weird feeling: Going out seems weird/scary/overwhelming/I don't know.

weird feeling: Something that happened a long time ago seems close, something that happened a short time ago feels far. weird feeling: This is about babies. Somewhere I have read ""I don't want kids on this terrible world."" And now there is a weird feeling when I see a baby.

weird feeling: Everything seems darker. Like my vision changed.

weird feeling: When I read here on reddit someone who is suicidal/depressed etc. All of the feelings come back and it feels like i am feeling the same way as him. (When time passes I can see the difference.)

69,"So I'm 19 and I've always had pretty bad anxiety and depression. But lately my paranoia has gone through the roof. Sometimes I think it's from how much I stay inside due to the fact that I'm a hermit but I'm also thinking it might be something much more psychological.

Whenever it's been a little while since I've hung out with my friend, or after we've gotten into even the smallest of arguments I always think they're plotting to kill me when we hang out. I still hang out because I'm constantly telling my self I'm being paranoid and crazy but the thought stays with me. Especially if they're taking me somewhere and won't tell me where (as a surprise).

That's not the only situation where my paranoia lies. Whenever I'm up at night or home alone even in the day time and I hear something even slightly obscure I constantly look out my window and look around my house between 3-10 times.

I hate it. It consumes me. Sometimes I can ignore it but a lot of the times I can't.
