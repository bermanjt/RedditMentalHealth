I've been looking for jobs, etc. I found one job, that I was going to get until they a collections from years ago on my credit report. If this place is so picky, I probably can't work in the field at all. I, also, am being looked at in that field for another job, but I probably have just been wasting my time.

Good News: Within 15 minutes of putting in application, I got a phone call from a business wanting an interview tomorrow. This not in the field I planned on going into. It's something though.

Meanwhile: I am having frequent mood swings, and I'm not bipolar. I'll feel depressed five minutes, then exhilarated the next five minutes. It feels like I'm taking hits of a stimulant, coming down, and then taking another hit. No, I am not on drugs.",14Jul2017,1

9,"So I have some mental health issues and am generally just not all that happy about life. However that all changes when I read or watch a favourite show. It's like I'm a completely different person. A big part of my I'm unhappy is because I feel I don't belong here, in this universe, but when I am in a fantasy world through watching, reading or even just fantasizing in my head I am happier. Is this normal? Like I'm only happy when I can live in my own fantasy world but as soon as I come out of it I'm not. Not a very efficient way to live. I don't even do anything anymore.

It's been that way for a while it feels like. These last 4 years I've lost friends and now I'm left with maybe 1 or 2 that are halfway across the country. 

I don't feel overly sad though, just like everything is grey and bleak, I mainly feel indifferent about everything now.

13,"Throwaway because this is personal I guess.

Just to start, I'm a 16 year old girl. I have a few good friends and a loving family and there's nothing really bad in my life, so I don't know where this is coming from. 

For the past week or so, I've been feeling awful. I feel so overwhelmed and sad for absolutely no reason. The only thing I can think of that might have made me nervous is that I just got my driving permit, but that's over with now. 

This past week the only emotion I have felt is sadness and I don't know what to do about it. It sounds dramatic but I just can't escape the feeling that everything around me is going wrong and spiraling downhill. Tonight I just lost it though. I got out of the shower and went into my room and just cried and I don't know why. It's now 3:30 am where I live and I can't stop. 

I also can't sleep. I just lay in bed for hours and when I do sleep, I never want to get up the next morning. I feel like I can't sleep because there is so much that I'm worrying about, which is what confuses me because it's summer - no school, I don't have a job yet, no other things to stress me out. I feel like I'm worrying and freaking out about something that might worry me in the future, if that makes sense.

I just feel so alone. I feel like I can't talk to anyone because I don't want to seem like I'm asking for all this attention from mainly my family. I also don't want to say anything to my mom because then it would make her sad and I wouldn't want her to spend money taking me to a doctor or therapist if there's no reason for it. Plus I would feel so embarrassed if something were actually wrong with me.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel so sad and all I want is to be happy again. I don't know what to expect from this post but I just needed to get this out to anyone who I don't personally know.

14,"I'm Aubrey, a 14 year old girl who normally stands out in a crowd. Maybe it's because I'm tall and lanky, with crazy all over the place curly hair. My family life I wouldn't say is anything super crazy, like my parents are still married, I have an older brother, and there hasn't been any abuse charges or anything in my family. But ever since I was little I always felt out of place, even in my own family. I can't pin my finger on it, but I always felt like my parents hated me or everyone was out to get me and my life was never equally worth everyone else's, and I was garbage.I never really had friends, I always was left out, and I always felt too ugly or fat. I remember when I was in first grade I was so obsessed with my weight I tried to lose 10 pounds in a week and measured my stomach and weighed myself every day. But according to my parents, I was really smart. I was reading as soon as I was talking, no one taught me, I taught myself. I loved to sort things, my favorite thing was alphabetizing books. I was always myself, but so worried about how others felt. The first time I remember cutting myself for the first time was when I was in 6th grade. I cut up my entire left arm. I did so because I felt like I could control what I did to myself and when no one noticed or cared, even my parents, I took it as a sign that it was ok for me to do. My school eventually called my mom and told her because someone told a counselor, but then she just told me to stop. Then I would just cut up my hips where no one could see. I didn't do it too often, but I did do it. I self diagnosed myself as having anxiety and depression. I switched schools in the middle of seventh grade, because I was being severely bullied at my other school. I still didn't have friends or anyone to talk to. My whole life, my brother has been popular and has had friends. I never have. Several times in sixth and seventh grade I attempted to drown myself, but I never did. My eighth grade year was a total nightmare. I became verbal with my family with how I had been having suicidal thoughts for a long time, but they didn't care. I had to beg my family to let me see a therapist, but she did not help me. While I was seeing her, I was put on anxiety and depression meds (I was SEVERELY mentally ill or however you would say it), I cut even more than ever, and had very drawn out plans on how I was going to kill myself. Everyday I would stash different knives and razors around the house so I could slit my wrists eventually. I had panic attacks about going to school each day, to the point where I was screaming and crying and was unresponsive to everyone. I missed a lot of school as a result. My mom still had to work, and she was frustrated that each day I started screaming and crying and threatening to kill myself if left alone. She eventually took me to the emergency room and they recommended I stay in an in patient mental ward. I refused and my mom refused so they couldn't force me, so they sent me home with some coping skills and a way to make a 504 for school stress. That didn't help. On May 31st, 2017, I made the definite decision I was going to end my life. School was still horrible, and I was being bullied to the point where I didn't go to a certain period in school, and my mom drove me to school when I was screaming and crying multiple times, and a counselor had to come out and drag me from the car. I had missed 2 days prior, because I was so scared because at a track meet, a large group of boys chased me around say I had autism and threw trash at me, and went as far as giving me an autism awareness bracelet. My mom contacted to the school and the boys got in trouble, but I was being cyberbullied extremely bad. I honestly couldn't find a reason to live. My whole family was telling me how much of a screw up I was that day and how horrible I was and how much better life would be without me. So, I decided to take a whole bottle of ibuprofen. I didn't take it all at once, I took some, nothing happened, so I took more (the doctors later found that troubling). My family seemed to think the rest of that day was pretty normal and nothing happened, but I woke up at about 5 in the morning feeling super sick. So for some reason I thought I needed a banana, so I went downstairs and as soon as I stood up, I started spewing everywhere. My dad yelled at me for throwing up on the ground. I started to freak out, thinking of how much I didn't actually want to die at that moment. I took a shower with all my clothes on screaming and crying and my parents not understanding why. My mom tried to calm me down and eventually I told her what I did. We rushed to our hometown ER and got tons of tests done and fluids put in me. It was obvious that I would be doing inpatient time. I went to Seattle Children's ER once I was stable, and got into the inpatient through there. I made a lot of friends that 7 day I was there and was happy there, but as soon as I got out I was miserable. I was put on new meds and stopped going to school, doing a home hospital thing. My mom has had to deal with an array of other suicide attempts, from me trying to strangle myself in the backseat of her car, to trying to jump off my roof. My mom is seriously the reason I'm here, because she has been put through all of this and still is by my side loving me. Today, I just learned that my current counselor thinks I'm doing so much better that I may get to have counseling just every other week. My brother lets me hang out with his friends sometimes, and I've been clean from cutting for 2 weeks. Please do not try to kill yourself. Because of my attempt, I have damaged my kidneys for the rest of my life. Life gets better, and I'm still trying to learn that. But if you think you have nothing to live for, think about living to the day you get to experience something amazing. this is already super lengthy so I'll leave it at that.

21,"Hi guys,

I'm a 24 year old female, who has recently moved over to Sydney, Australia from London, UK. I've lived here for about 4 months now, but recently I believe my mental health has taken a nosedive. The first things that I noticed were irritability, becoming really sad or angry all of a sudden and just generally being moody. I believe it's down to stress, since I've been extremely stressed for the following reasons:
1) Moving countries
2) Missing friends and family, and feeling a bit too nervous on the making friends front
3) Repaying debts in the UK
4) Everything being expensive AF in Sydney!
5) Really wanting to go back to university to study but not being able to due to financial implications

However every day this week I've been feeling much worse - I will randomly start feeling extremely nauseous and panicky. Last Saturday night I had to pace around for 2 hours before I felt a bit better. I've felt the same feeling while at work and particularly on trains and in cars - at one point I nearly felt like I had to rush off the train. I think I started feeling worse after a conversation with my partner, wherein he said he didn't know how to help me when I was feeling low and he 'didn't want him caring for me to take away from his independent time'. We've been together for 1.5 years and moved to Australia together.

Can anyone please give advice on how to manage these periods of nausea? I have quite a phobia of vomiting, so it's been rather unpleasant. Any advice would be great!

Thanks.",14Jul2017,1
28,"I have put this in r/mentalhealth instead of r/bipolar as I feel that lots of people can contribute.

The doctors and nurses at my local practices/psych. clinics are really nervous about me going away. I'm going to America for a month. 99% of travel will be with a tour group and also my friends. Flights are solo travel and first 2 days in San Francisco I will be alone.

I will admit I have noticed recently I am a bit hypomanic (not sleeping well, creative, more energy than normal, not eating as much, talking loads, tonnes of paranoia thoughts). I guess I'd call myself a 5-6 out of 10 at the moment. The nurse is worried that I might trigger myself into mania... I have a pattern of triggering mania when I don't sleep properly. I am about to go to San Francisco from UK, so jet lag could be a huge problem with my sleeping pattern. She's given me 25mg Zopiclone to sleep, but I overdosed on this before (though I was on Sertraline without a mood stabiliser... so as you can imagine I went f**king crazy). She's also given me 25mg PRNs to take immediately if I start getting 6-7 on the mood scale.

How sad that I now have to feel like a walking f**king pharmacy to function like a 'normal' human being. I'm also taking the contraceptive POP pill. I'm constantly pumped full of tablets haha.

I am really nervous about going and my boyfriend will be in the UK, so that makes me nervous as he is my rock. He couldn't get time of work but he really, really wants me to have a great experience and supports me immensely. He's wonderful. I really don't want to let my disorder stop me from having fun on my trip and having amazing life experiences with my friends and on my own.

Does anyone have any advice or tips? I have bought travel insurance. It was obviously f**king expensive but worth it in case.

[Context]: I have Bipolar Type 1. I was diagnosed in May, but I've been referred 4 separate times over a period of 4-5 years. For a short while at univeristy I was diagnosed with Generalised Anxiety Disorder. Now I have been told as well as Bipolar Type 1, I have G.A.D. and some signs of OCD.

29,"I have no opportunities. I can barely do anything, I dropped out of high school as a senior becuase I just couldn't take it even for a few months to graduate. I've been depressed for years, and with my treatment it was all about coping with and tolerating my illnesses, but I didn't build anything. I've lost tolerance, I've lost my ability to cope. I suffered in highschool for nothing. I couldn't go back to school either, my learning disabilities are so bad, even basic employment is unrealistic, I can't interpret directions, wake up in the morning or deal with any stress.

And now I'm not even well enough to do the things that would supposedly make me feel better. I'm so exhausted, I can't exercise for the endorphins, I'm too anxious to go out and do practically anything, I'm completely unmotivated. Even though I want to get better, I can't bring myself to go through the momentary discomfort of anything that would help my depression. 

So now I'm stuck. I can't bring myself to do anything. I can't even paint. I never do anymore. I loved painting. I just lay in bed all day. I want something to change, but I know it won't if I don't do anything about it. So I'm just waiting for death, and I'm 19 so I probably have a while. I can't try to kill myself again, mostly because I can't stand how my SO would be distraught. He's all I have now, and I love him so much but I need more. I need a life.

34,"Mental illness causes suffering. Me deciding life is pointless doesn't cause me suffering. 
  

My current plan is to do only things I like, then kill myself when I can't do things I like anymore. Why bother doing things I don't like if living is pointless?  

  
The majority of humans follow their instinct to survive so the point of their lives is to survive until they die of old age. Surviving involves doing lots of things you don't like.  
  

Majority of humans are part of society. Not following your instinct to survive probably means you don't contribute to society and you'll suicide which negatively affects society, so of course humans want everyone's brains to be in a ""im just an animal following biological instinct to survive and reproduce"" state, otherwise society would fail.


The only reason for me to do things I don't like is to survive because I'm so kind I'll spare the people I care about the pain of my death. How annoying, having to do things I don't like because there's people still alive that I care about (just my parents that I'm not close to)

Now, I'm not a sociopath and I have never been diagnosed with any form of aspergers/autism. I feel very extremely sad (sometimes too sad) when others suffer and find a ton of pleasure in making others happy.

However, I can never tell what someone is feeling without a very clear signal. Sometimes I know that I've annoyed someone or upset them, but I never understand why. And when people upset or annoy me, I never know how to express this because I don't know what a normal response is. So I just cry and then wonder for weeks what happened. I just cant understand other people without projecting my own motives or feelings onto them.

42,"I've been treated for depression and anxiety for nearly 20 years - since I was 9 or 10 years old (I'm a 28yo female). While certain aspects of these got better with medication and therapy, something still always felt ""not right.""

As a kid, it took me a while to catch on, but eventually I started to realize that the way I thought and the way my classmates thought was not the same. Not to say that I was ~SO UNIQUE~ just more like I couldn't relate to them. Or their motivations confused me. Or I just didn't realize that I was being jerked around.

People even now describe me as being a little bit odd. Or different. In the past few years, I've been trying to figure out what this other thing, the ""not right"" part of me could be, instead of just settling for ""I guess this is as good as it's gonna get."" Reading and reflecting on my own lead me to wonder if it could be something on the autism spectrum or possibly AD/HD. I started seeing a new therapist a couple months ago and finally brought this up to her. While I really like her, I felt frustrated when she said I had neither after a few questions. I'm perfectly willing to accept that it was neither of those things, but I felt kind of off put when she asked why I thought there was something wrong other than my depression and anxiety.

She said I was too aware to be on the autism spectrum and not distracted enough to have AD/HD. But the more I think about it, the more it feels like yes, I do have some of those things, just not your textbook examples. As s kid, I could never pay ettention during lectures of ""read out loud"" portions in class; inevitably I would zone out and daydream, doodle, or flip ahead to more interesting parts of the text book. I have a bad habit of taking people literally or at face value, so when people are joking, sometimes I just don't catch on. Ditto for when people are being insincere. My time management is HORRENDOUS; despite waking up even an hour early, setting alarms, and making check lists, I always manage to get distracted by something or just can't grasp the passage of time, so I'm frequently late to things. If clothing is too tight or an uncomfortable material, I'm not able to focus on anything BUT that. I have difficulty finding my focus; it feels like there's a cork stuck in the bottle where all my focus and concentration is, but I don't have a corkscrew. Alternatively, sometimes I get TOO focused on things; and usually insignificant things at that. If my routine or preplanned schedule is disrupted, the whole day is basically a wash. It's like it knocks me off kilter and I can't get back up on the horse. It can even be something as simple as something coming up where I need to go out, when I had planned to stay in and do nothing. I often feel restless and like I should be doing something and this makes it difficult to do the things I enjoy. When I am doing things I enjoy, like using my laptop, it's like I can't stay focused on one thing. I find it difficult to finish a movie or TV episode without frequently switching to other tabs to do something else. One of the most frustrating things is what I call noise pollution; I work as a police dispatcher and if I've got the radio going and the tv on and people talking in the room, I can't differentiate between sounds. It all just becomes a single noise and I can't pinpoint what is coming from where. I recently went to a friend's baby shower and it took me three days to recover because I was with a large group of people i didn't know and therefore didn't know how to act around. There are scores of other examples but I feel like I should spare you if you've read this far lol.

I don't want to push and say that she's wrong, because it makes me feel... idk kind of like I'm just begging for a diagnosis. But at the same time, SOMETHING is off and I still don't know what it is. I just want to know what the ""not right"" thing is so I can look into ways to manage it, not because I want people to pity me or because I'm looking for disability benefits or anything. I really just want to put a name to this so I can help myself. I don't know if I should seek another mental health professional out? Or if there's some other kind of doctor I should look into seeing? Or if I'm completely off base with what I think this is? I feel like there's a really great person inside me somewhere, but this block is keeping me from being that person, ss much as I try. Anyone ever have similar symptoms like I described? What did you do about it?",14Jul2017,4
43,"First off this is my first ever Reddit post i only made an account before so please forgive any newb mistakes i make. thanks. I'm looking for a someone to listen and maybe share something insightful. apologies if this is too long i thank anyone who has the patience to wade through it. let me tell you about myself.

I'm 21 year old male living with my mum and sister i have never met my father so i believe it may be one reason why I have many issues but i dont want to use that as an excuse. I have barley no self confidence and the wretched demon we all know and hate, yes anxiety. In all honesty i have no idea where to start so ill try just naming things that I believe are potential causes.
I have a lazy eye 
Zero social skills
I can not function in a group its one of my biggest triggers
A strange behaviour that makes me walk off when people are show me attention (usually this happens the moment the conversation slows or immediate stop, rude I know)
I have no sense of identity and what I believe in ( i have a neural good set of morals)
No friends (that I can trust)
my body language is wrong and its hard to be fluid my mind is either blank or self centred, if it doesnt involve me ive no empathy for it (i used to be the opposite)
I come off as stupid or cold
inaccurate facial expressions, my hello is a sheepish grin, at my last job i used to get called serial killer and workplace shooter
I fear rejection and judgement (pathetic i know everybody gets judged anyway so why not live a little bit of life right?)
I think perhaps i might suffer from mild retardation because i cant find anything on the internet about my, well my self
none of this is coming out right but i will keep trying,
 
there is something specifically anxiety related id like to try and explain, maybe if one person could relate that would be everything because right now i am a shard of glass in a tornado.

i feel that anxiety has kept me safe, i feel like i would be dangerous without it, ive dark (i mean really dark) intrusive impulses ( i think that its my body trying to express something that has been trapped for so long) ive done some pretty bad things but without anxiety i would have no cage, does this make sense? i went through a phase of wanting ANOTHER FEELING SO MUCH I indulged in dangerous behaviour, a lot of it sexually perverse and rebelious to list a few in order of severity 
i stole from work 
distrubing self masturbation on church property
tortured a frog
practised stalking people
there is more i wont list
I KNOW ITS BAD but i honestly beleive i did these things TO FEEL SOME EXCITEMENT because im wasting away here, a pathetic shell. trapped in negativity for a long time anxiety has made me colder to the outside world but yet i care what people think about me, i fantasise about saving people at work and being liked by those people (its a re accuring bubble) 
this isnt even half of the stuff i wanted to write and almost all of it has came out wrong its all chaos up there man self centred chaos but i feel like if i dont reach out now, i never will. im not looking for pity or to be judged but honesty is what i need to hear

please mind my spelling and my mistakes.
Thanks a thousand

44,"Is BPD the only true cause of extreme emotional volatility? - emotional volatility as in being moody, controlling, *hyper*-sensitive to your surroundings and other people, easily triggered, and blowing up like a nuclear blast (screaming and sobbing) if someone/something triggers you, your general stress level has gotten too high, or you're just having a bad day. Or can this be caused by something else?

Even if you don't necessarily have all of the universal features of BPD, is extreme emotional volatility enough for a diagnosis, seeing that extreme emotional volatility a) certainly isn't normal, and b) doesn't seem to be caused by anything else other than BPD? (Not counting extreme emotional volatility in the presence of something else, like a psychotic episode, manic episode, severe trauma, etc.).

46,"Hi,

Dont know if this is the right place but...

As the title states, ive been dating this girl for a little while now and she recently told me about a serious sexual assault she was involved in. She didnt go into details but told me she suffered from PTSD and was still undergoing therapy.

I knew she had a history of anxiety and depression and occasionally has her 'off days' where i either come to hers for a cuddle so she can cry or sometimes she just wants to be on her own. The story of the assault was quite a shock to me.

She was understandably in a bad way when she told me and cried her eyes out. I just kinda held her for an hour while she cried and thanked her for telling me and told her that i was always there if she needed to talk. She later admitted that she thought i would leave her for telling me and i reassured her that i would never do that.

My question is, how do i be a good boyfriend for someone who has gone through and is still going through this? I want to be there and i want to take care of her but im not sure the right way to go about this. What she has gone through isnt a deal-breaker like she worried, its not her fault. I just want to be a good boyfriend and be there when she has problems with her mental health. Any ideas reddit?

TL;DR: GF told me she was the victim of a sexual assault and suffers from PTSD. Want to be there for her but dont know how.
