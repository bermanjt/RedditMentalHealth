I usually suffer from anxiety, and at points in my past, depression. I moved to a new city about 3 months ago, and especially now feel like I'm going through a rougher patch. I'd like to get into therapy preemptively, but with the holidays approaching, I wouldn't realistically get in to see a psychologist until after the New Year.

1,"I've been in therapy for a couple of months now, and my counselor has advised me to talk to a doctor about anti-depressants/anti-anxiety meds. Without writing a novel, I feel really really bad pretty much all day every day. Whenever I have an uptick in my mood, it's followed by a crash that lasts way longer than the initial positive emotions. I think about suicide a lot; I'm not on the verge of killing myself, I just want this to end. I have no immediate plans to hurt myself in any way. I constantly think about shooting myself in the head, although I've recently started thinking about building a guillotine to do it instead. I'm not saying that to cause alarm or to elicit a response. I was told that I need to be honest with the doctor (I'm actually going to see a nurse practitioner, I was told the doctor wouldn't see me until mid-January), so I'm writing that here to give you the truth so that I know what to tell the nurse. I genuinely want to get better. What do I say/need to have prepared for my appointment to facilitate that?",15Dec2017,1,

I've hated my personality for the longest time, i keep feeling shitty because of my outbursts. I feel extremely miserable. Sometimes it feels like i can literally hear the voice of reason telling me to stop doing something, but i just do it and end up feeling bad. It feels like I can't control my emotions. Like i'm a walking embodiment of anger and frustration ready to explode. It's not like there wasn't a time where i was completely peaceful, but i got hurt so much because of my passiveness and people kept walking over me because of it. I used to handle things better but now i don't know why i can't anymore. I'm so sorry if this doesn't make any sense, i feel like i have to let it out somewhere.

3,"I hope whoever sees this feels able to share any similar experiences with juggling physical/mental health issues; and whether or not your employers are understanding, as it is nice to feel like you're not alone. :)

This has been a difficult week for me. My physical health is as iffy as my mental health, especially in the winter months. I've been absent from work this week thanks to stomach troubles. Taking time off for sickness is pretty risky and stressful, as I am fairly new to the job, and could easily be let go if I exceed the sickness allowance so quickly. I also get very anxious when calling in sick, and worry that they'll interrogate and not believe me. With all that in mind, I don't feel able to tell them that I've been struggling mentally for the past few weeks, and that this absence is as necessary for mental recovery as it is physical. As much as it may help them understand why I'm off, it could also be a reason for them to let me go.
 So I've spent all week at home alone. Home is, and has always been my place of comfort and safety, somewhere that I rarely want to leave. BUT being stuck in alone for too long gets to me sometimes. My brain conjures up horrible scenarios, where my employers think I'm faking being sick and decide to fire me; and where my partner starts to resent me and see me as a burden because I'm always getting sick and jeopardising my job by being off when I shouldn't be. I also started to second-guess myself, and wonder if I've actually managed to convince MYSELF that I'm sick without even realising it- because I'm lazy and just want to sit at home all day. 
 Obviously, all this inner turmoil makes my stomach problems and nausea way worse, and so I'm having difficulty establishing whether my sickness is actually due to a virus; or due to my mental health. It seems to be becoming a vicious cycle. 

Sorry for the long post, I really needed to get that off my chest, as I don't like to bother the few people I'm close to with problems they may not be able to understand. I'd really like to hear from anyone with similar stuff going on in their head, and how you've been dealing with it.",15Dec2017,2,

5,"Hi, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this. If it's not, or if there's another place I could, I'd appreciate being pointed in the right direction. I'm posting this from an alt account because there is information that I would prefer that anyone who knows my main account wouldn't see. Anyways, I'll just jump into it. Over the last several months, my 72-year-old father's health has been deteriorating. He had an open heart surgery early last year and it's been mostly downhill from there. I'm not sure if it's an issue of his brain not getting enough oxygen, or if it's dementia, but his mental capacity has degraded significantly. He's not really the same person anymore and he can be tough to talk to at times. I would describe his new behavior as child-like, and he can't think critically anymore.

He lives with my mom a little over an hour away from me and it's been really hard on her. She takes care of him 24/7 and it's not an easy job. He doesn't do much for himself as far as grooming or preparing food, although he has started ordering out more which is fine. He's got incontinence issues, and my mom usually has to clean him/the house up at least once, if not multiple times a day. He's become an impulse-buyer, where he will order a ton of useless junk from catalogs. Things like doormats, motion sensor owl statues (he actually bought two of these), steering wheel covers, etc. It got so bad that once when my mom came to my place for the weekend so we could go to a funeral, she went home to 14 packages on her front door. She's had to intercept packages and send them back and she had to take away his credit cards so he doesn't keep buying things.

Also, like I mentioned in the title, he's an alcoholic. He was probably an alcoholic for many years before all of this but it was nowhere close to being as bad as he is now. He was a smart person with a respectable job and a good father for the most part. With his deteriorating condition, it's really been affecting him. He's lost a ton of weight, despite eating a lot and has been told on multiple occasions by doctors that alcohol abuse is largely responsible for many of his ailments. A couple of weeks ago I got a call from my mom in the morning on my way to work that my dad had fallen from drinking too much, which he has done many times, and she was going to take him to the hospital. He fell super early in the morning and my mom was unable to help him get on his feet again, so she had to get him onto a feather-bed on the floor. I called off work and went down to help her. He had hit his head pretty hard, hurt his shoulder, and couldn't walk. He kept saying on the way to the hospital that he bet he had a stroke. After we got him checked in and a doctor looked him over and took some blood we found out that he hadn't had a stroke, but he was just extremely intoxicated. He had a BAC of something like 0.220 despite the fact that he had fallen about 8 hours earlier and hadn't had a drink since.

Now, he flat out denies that he's an alcoholic and won't come close to consider going to rehab, especially at his age. My mom, my siblings, doctors, and I have all tried on several occasions to address his problem. The same thing always happens, no matter how you try to go about it: the second you mention his drinking he becomes very hostile and refuses to give you an inch. He curses at you and tells you to shut up about it. Personally, I've first tried to address it from a place of concern and support but I admit that I and other members of my family got fed up after a while and have basically told him how selfish he's being and to get his shit together. We're all convinced that he will never do anything about it, and I could even let him do it to himself at this point if it only affected his health. However, it's been affecting my mom in a big way. She's only in her early 60s so she isn't as old as my dad but she's basically going through hell. I, and the rest of my siblings, are more than an hour away so there's not much we can do on a day-to-day basis, but my dad makes the house a mess with all of his accidents and spilling of drinks. He sleeps on the living room couch because he usually drinks to the point where he can't walk very well, if at all, and it has the added benefit of being closer to the alcohol. The couch, and by extension my dad, is filthy to the point where no one goes near it and he showers maybe once a week, only if my mom forces him.

The easy solution seems to be get rid of his alcohol. The problem is that my mom can't be home 24/7 and we're worried that he'll just drive to the liquor store or take a cab and potentially hurt himself or someone else. I don't want to make it sound like we lock him up because my mom still takes him wherever he wants to go, but I'm very worried about the idea of him driving, even sober. Anyways, when we were at the hospital we talked to the doctor about potentially 302ing him, which is basically involuntary intervention for a few days to try to figure out a better course of action. The doctor told us it was very unlikely unless we could prove that he was a danger to himself and others, as making someone go against their will isn't normally feasible, which I totally understand. While I believe that he is absolutely a danger to himself and potentially others, there isn't enough we could do to get it to happen. We talked to a couple of other people at the hospital who specialize in this type of thing and they basically told us the same thing. We did refuse to check him out until he talked to one of them but he just ignored them until they were finished and we had to leave.

Since that day, he has been drinking a little less but nothing else has changed. It's still an enormous strain on my mom who calls me in tears, sometimes a couple of times a week, because of how stressed she is. I try to help however I can, but there's not much I can do. He's not in good health but he's not close to the point where he needs to be hospitalized and even after the most recent episode, no one at the hospital has been able to tell us what to do next. It kills me to see my mom this way and I was just hoping that someone else out there is in or has heard of a similar situation and give me some advice.

Please ask any questions you want to and thank you so much for any replies.

16,"I've often wondered if there was something a little ... Off ... About me. 

I have a brother with Autism. When they diagnosed him, they said he had Aspergers and atypical autism, along with ADHD and pervasive developmental disorder. 

I've often wondered if I have autism too, or if maybe I picked up on some of his behaviors when I was growing up. He was my big brother, after all. I looked up to him. 

But here's the thing: I am super awkward in some situations, but not others. 

I can be totally comfortable around some people, and totally awkward around others. And by awkward, I mean ""why did I just say that omg stop talking oh shit you're still talking just shut up"" kinda awkward. 

I'm just so confused! I had a therapist and I asked her and she said she doesn't think I have autism, but that's because she's one of the people I'm comfortable around, so it wouldn't show around her. I have coworkers I talk to on a daily basis that I still feel weird around, and sometimes I get the feeling they're talking to me like they would to my brother. Others, I'm instantly comfortable around. Like my boyfriend or my best friend.

I saw a shrink today for the first time, I just moved and saw a new shrink.

1. I was under the impression I was seeing a female shrink, I have sexual abuse related trauma and am not super comfortable with being alone with strange men that I don't know.

2. He constantly interrupted me, asked me questions and would cut me off halfway through my answers.

3. He was writing everything down on a piece of paper but still couldn't remember what I was saying, repeating important details 5 or so times in a one hour eval.

4. He changed my diagnosis, and that's something I've never had done, I've had my diagnosis added to, but never taken away. Especially when I still experience symptoms, I felt like he was saying they're not important.
Example, I have OCD and have looping and invasive thoughts, and some ritualistic tendencies. I felt like he down played them... Hey man you don't live my every day life. I feel like you're not listening 

6. He said he didn't want to label me when I was so young. I'm 25 and have had my preexisting diagnoses for almost 8 years. I've lived with the labels. 

7. I genuinely don't know if I am being defensive because that's how I get with therapists and shrinks or if this was a genuinely negative experience. 

I was prescribed medication and I am hesitant to take it because I feel like I can't trust him. I can't decide if it's my trust issues or him.

If something little happens to me I cry out of frustration. 

I do have friends, and I do get invited out so I suppose I'm not a totally annoyance to be around. but I still have those flaws

However, when it comes to bigger things, like life changing events, I tend to go really numb and have no reaction to it at all. Someone could ask me ""is anxiety running your life?""

39,"Hello there,

First time posting here. I know the friend thing is a resource used to not to admit something happening to you. But we are all anons here so this is genuinely about my friend. First of all I want to apologize for my English and hope you can understand me.

**Some background:** My friend is a 23yo female. She came from Turkey to Spain when she was 7. She had a though life since her parents' marriage wasn't legit and there were lots of other interests there. Her father died in a car accident when she was 4 while going to visit his lover and her mother tried to commit suicide. They both then came to Spain, her mother met this great guy here and they got another child and their lives started over happily.

I feel she has been very insecure her entire life because of her looks. She is shorter than the usual, she must be like 4'7''. I remmeber how people at school always laughed at her. Plus, she has always been the smart girl and got the best grades in class. I'm saying she's insecure because even her friends couldn't joke with her about anything. We are always messing around between each others, but she always takes it wrong. Even now that we are all 23. 

Most of the people of our school dropped it. We decided to go to the university. Now we are done studying and we have good jobs. At the beginning she was offered a job 600 km away from our city. She took it but only stayed there for like six months. I don't really know how her life went during this time because I was kind of isolated from the whole group of friends. But I know that she started drinking alone and smoking a lot of weed.

She came back to town in June. She quite drinking alone and smoking weed because she apparently felt better. Her parents moved to Germany in July. She found a job in town and now she lives by herself with her two cats. And here's the thing: she's acting weird lately but there is no reason, at least apparently. She's having trouble because she is worried about her sentimental life (she feels like no one has ever taken care of her the way she thinks she deserves and keeps insisting that she's tired of just fucking random guys and not seeing them again). I think this is all because her family is away.

**What's wrong:** What we find strange are her moods. She either can be really grumpy (like, really really really really grumpy) or really happy. Normally it's the grumpy one. She's being impulsive with her decisions. She's seeing a guy she likes and apparently he likes her back but she keeps arguing with him for no reason and getting nervous because he won't argue with her as well. She dumped him in a rage attack and then suddenly walked to his home to tell him she's sorry (that's like 2 miles away xd).

She gets annoyed by the dumbest thing you could imagine. A week ago, she sent us a voice note through WhatsApp of 3 minutes literally crying and shouting because her stove didn't work. This morning, another voice note shouting with real anger about how one of her cats scratched her leg. But I insist: in a very exaggerated way.

**How we (her friends) have dealt with this situation:** At the beginning we tried to minimize the problems and give her some perspective. Whenever she came back from work arguing about how she had a fight with a customer, we tried to make her laugh comparing it with our argues with customers, or tell her she got to think about the other person's perspective, etc. That never worked. She endeded up angrier. 

Now that this has been happening for three months now, we got tired of trying and just say what we think. We do it, but always from the perspective of a worried friend. We tell her that the way she treats this guy is not always the best one, and that she could be more comprehensive and give him some margin. She says that she knows that she does have a problem and until she does not know how to solve it, she won't be happy around others. She admits this guy never did anything wrong. 

We told her to go to the doctor and she got really mad. She said that the only thing a doctor is going to do is to receipt her some pills to ""besot her"" (sic.) and that she does not want that. She says she will eventually find a way to deal with this situation and reorganise her life (she's always saying she has a lot to do, a lot of plans to accomplish like changes on her professional life, going to the gym, eat better, etc.). 

She's even told us not to pay attention to her mental breakdowns as they are now usual. **""Whenever you see I'm panicking and overreacting, please don't listen to me and don't take anything seriously"".** She's said this because she has hurt us many times with her impulsive, non-thought rage answers.

And we try. But it's getting worse and we don't know what to do now. 

I know this has to do with mental health but I can't identify if this is about depression or anxiety. For now, some advice on how to treat her - what to do and what NOT to do will do.

Thank you very much in advance.",15Dec2017,3,
40,Im so worried about my partner all the time. She is severely mentally ill and I don't know what to do. I worry about her all the time and I do my best to be supportive but I can only do so much. There are talks about her being readmitted to hospital after she recently got out a month ago. Although last time being admitted onky seemed to worsen her symptoms. She made an attempt on her life whilst hospitalised and was put on a more intense care plan in hospital there after for a few months. It scares me. I worry that I will wake up one day and she wont be there anymore. I just dont know what to do. Both for my own mental health and for hers. Olease could someone give me some advice. ,15Dec2017,1,

42,"Hi guys! I recently made some changes to my appearance, all within the last 2 to 3 weeks. I completely changed my hair after having the same style for literally my whole life (cut off almost a foot and changed my part), got my braces off after a year, and bought a whole new style of glasses. Overall, I think I look pretty good.

However, I got this really weird feeling a few nights ago and I can't shake it. I guess I was picturing myself in my head, and when I looked in the mirror I felt confused. Like I was in the wrong body or something. I felt really aware of my voice and my face and just how I'm taking up space in a room. It's a really creepy feeling, to say the least. I've been at home alone a lot, so I haven't really been talking out loud until the evening. Maybe that could explain why I thought my voice sounded weird?

I also started taking a Sam-E supplement for my anxiety around the same time I chopped my hair off, etc. I feel a lot less anxious and shaky and like I'm not vibrating constantly with nerves. But if it could be behind this weird feeling I might stop taking it.

I speak up my mind and others disagree, I obsess over that. I didn't say hello to the person for having the anxiety ""should i or should i not?"" And then obsess over the thought of how i suck and that person must hate me now. 

Obsessive thoughts over stuff I'm interested in are also present. My mind really isn't a healthy y and I'm so sick of it. I want to feel free from these thoughts that limit myself....

48,".. actually this isn't what's bothering me.  It's my anxiety, or lack of it. My cognition doesn't seem to match my affect.  It's almost like I'm snapping. I'm afraid I'll lose who I am, and completely snap and become ""echo""... By that I mean someone who just does whatever anyone tells them.. someone who doesn't have a self.  Someone in my life has been ""love bombing"" me.  There's no substance to this love. As I posted before, it's just a constant bombardment of ""I love you"".  This person has neglected me emotionally my entire life. They weren't there when I was in high school, they weren't there when I was in university, they know nothing about me.  My mom has even said he always leaves us and goes (to advance his medical training).  But while he does these he continually says he loves me. There's other stuff.. I feel too broken to continue this rant.  I've snapped. I hate this feeling. It's like empty nothing. It's like being pacified. It's like being pushed to a point where you just don't care at all, but you're content and don't want to do anything.  Whatever, it's a crappy feeling.

Edit: I don't hate this person (my dad). I wouldn't want anything to happen to them. I love them.  I'm trying not to be insolent, but it's really irritating me.",15Dec2017,3,
49,"I have a problem, and have had for a few years now where I think about things over and over again, to the point where i create delusions or false scenarios and more often than not the main problem is that I try to stop myself from overthinking and therefore think more about the things I shouldn't be thinking about. About 3 weeks ago I was feeling much better for the first time in years, I was happy, less stressed, less anxious and generally okay, then I went on a night out with my friends and on the way back (when I was black out drunk) apparently I started shouting at this total stranger for being fat in a shop (me and my friends call each other fat all the time as an inside joke) . Now I have it i my head that this man was anorexic and that I have ruined his life or potentially killed him and I can't shed myself of the image of it even though my friend has told me he seemed like a normal guy, didn't look especially thin and didn't look at all offended when i called him fat, just walked away. Despite this I have this ""memory"" which i can't say for sure isn't just my imagination of me sensing the guy would be offended if i called him fat and therefore proceeded to do so because it would be funny. I'm now living with the guilt of having ruined someone's life or even potentially having killed them and I can't see a way out of this hole even though I know that it is so unlikely that I have actually done anything wrong.

50,"Hello.

Long story short, am I a psychopath?

Female, 20 yo, PNW, white, hispanic, 4 months pregnant, history of anxiety, panic attacks, severe depression, suicide attempts, Borderline Personality Disorder, self harm.

So this morning, not for the first time, I got very close to killing my cats. I have already been diagnosed with BPD. I know I have very little emotion, if I feel anything it is just a reflection of the emotions I see in other people. I am very good at noticing details and analyzing what others are thinking and feeling. I am also very good in school and always have been, with little studying. I just inherently understand things. I have got a bit of a god complex.

Anyway, my boyfriend's cats have always been worthless little shits. Always sick, no matter how we baby them. Always destroying my plants and shit thats very important. Today they destroyed the bamboo plant I have owned for 5 years, that my mom bought me. I chased them for a good half hour and then couldn't stop hitting them and throwing them against the walls. I was going to kill them. I might have broken bones. Every scratch they left on me felt good too, because I enjoy self harming and certain kinds of pain. I have restrained myself more with them in previous times because my bf was there. But not this time. I have daydreamed of what snapping their necks would be like and how I would cover it up. Like just for funsies, not because I was angry.

I am also pregnant, and it seems like my BPD has gotten way, way worse than before. I am fighting with my bf all the time and I feel no sympathy when he tries to fix our ""problems"". He has ASD. I probably won't kill our kid but even getting an abortion sounded enjoyable in a way. I keep having worse and worse invasive thoughts. Im in the middle of my second trimester, this is supposed to be the best part of pregnancy, the easy feel good part. But I feel worse than ever before. I wanted to kill things significantly less as a child, despite my anger issues. Now it sounds enjoyable.

So my question is, am I progressing beyond BPD? Will it stop after I give birth? Am I becoming a full on psychopath? Or is it schizophrenia? I am already borderline. I know I am high risk for postpartum depression and psychosis. I don't want to kill my kid once its out of me....

The only thing I can do to feel better is smoke a ton of weed. Help.",15Dec2017,0,
51,"I live across the country, but have a great relationship with my niece who is almost 21. We talk openly, and she is one of my favorite people to talk to. This week, she had a breakdown and has been hospitalized since Monday. The doctors aren't exactly sure what it is, but terms like bipolar and schizophrenic have been thrown around.

She is allow to have phone calls, so I want to call and check in on her, but I've never dealt with anything like this, so I don't want to be patronizing, or insulting, or condescending. Are there any resources that can help coach me in the right directions? I'd like to learn how I can help and be supportive.",15Dec2017,1,
52,"I have struggled with my mental health from the age of 16/17, now 23 (M). I live with my father now who doesn't know me very well because he's neglected our relationship in a lot of ways throughout my teenage years and after. It makes him sad that I have been struggling so much since I moved out at 18, so he made me come back this year.
However our contact has not improved a bit. Whenever he feels like my behaviour is off or that I am not doing so well that week, he will not talk about it with me and generally ignore me until I come back out of my funk and initiate contact. It really hurts me that he lets me go like that when the whole point of living with him is to make sure Im doing alright and getting better in a stable way. 
We hardly ever talk but when we do I feel like it has to be lighthearted. But I wish he would just accept that a big part of my behaviour isnt me but my depression/psychosis/whatever not being managed properly.

I know Im 23 and stuff and improving relationships with parents is notoriously hard and complex, but I am deluding myself if I think I can do this recovery and management all by myself. I feel like I might not get better if things don't change in our relationship. Im living with him but I feel like a burden, unwanted here and there is no upside from living here. I have a terribly small 4sq metre room, dont even have a desk or proper wardrobe closet. He and his gf smoke in the house all day and my lungs cant handle that, he's always watching tv when he is here or pdaing with his gf. We never do anything together. The only times he initiates conversation is when he wants to tell me I am dirty and stink and wouldnt I be able to clean my room this weekend? 

In other words I hate how it is going right now and I feel like Im on my own. I need help or at least that I am taken into account with how they live here. How it is around here right now is the biggest obstacle to me working again, making friends and possibly starting university again and also live on my own. 

How do I get through to him and make him understand that its a mental health issue and not something inherently wrong with me and my personality. Its making me feel like a monster",15Dec2017,2,

54,"I got this since I hit puberty and started to produce some testosterone. Since this I got extra energy not only for activities but also for my way of thinking. For most of my childhood I was an angel child and chill and I still am but I had so many phantasies about doing harm to people that got into my way. Everytime someone alpha uped on me I was thinking after it of how I would take my revenge or act differently in a way that I would seem the ""more dominant"" than someone else. It came to a point that I am not even scared or amazed of myself and my dark fantasies. I heard some people have something similar and they aren't some evil vilains or anything so maybe thats why but if it has a name or its genetic or any kind of stuff tell me everything about it.   I didnt have any problems in keeping my hands to myself and not kick someone ass (or get my ass kicked) except for once in my entire lifetime which ended in an ok relations between me and friend from my class.

56,"Hi everyone,

I believe I may be experiencing some form of Adjustment Disorder. I say this because the problems I've been having centre around ""an identifiable external stressor.""

My behaviour has become erratic and I feel this has sent me into a worsening downward spiral. Every time I act out, I'm wracked with guilt and shame about what I've done (even if those involved don't feel it was a big deal). I am however starting to build control over my behaviours at least. I was wondering if anyone had any experience with this disorder, and more specifically, coming to a resolution in relation to the specific stressor?

I don't really have anyone to talk to - I do have friends and I live with my girlfriend but I either feel uncomfortable talking to the individual about my problems or it seems to go over their head - perhaps because my reaction to it is outside of the norm!

Anyway I'd really appreciate some advice. I should also note that I'm not trying to diagnose myself with a disorder, but in any case the description seems to fit perfectly with my situation.

Edit for clarity: I'm looking for ways to approach the problem and come to a resolution. I've been quite harsh on myself and perhaps overly clinical - trying to get to the ""root"" of the issue without really giving myself a break. If you feel it might help to know more I'm happy to share, but I've not gone into detail purely for the sake of brevity.

Thanks",15Dec2017,1,
