1,"Hi all:

In June of this year, I believe I experienced a nervous breakdown (I may still be going through it, but I'm better). I experienced a build up on debilitating anxiety, which began end of 2016. It was so bad, I believe I experienced derealization/depersonalization, and I had to quit my job because I could barely function (even at home). I felt extremely overstimulated and couldn't even watch TV.

To give some context, I'm 24 years old and I moved home since graduating college in 2015. I experienced some depression in college, and I knew I was going to be miserable at home, but took a job here for the opportunity. Since moving home, I've been trying to improve myself with positivity and motivation, consuming self-help books, etc. My parents have been pretty nice, but they are immigrants and have high expectations for me career-wise. I sometimes experience the immigrant guilt trip from them.

Anyways, following this time in June I was experiencing intense emotions of resentment and rage -- mostly aimed at my parents, but I had this intense fear of snapping/lashing out at any moment. The anxiety and panic attacks, however, prevented me from expressing these emotions. I think this stems from resentment in that I always do what people ask of me, and have driven myself crazy because of this.

Now, months later, I'm still depressed and confused about what happened. I feel bitter about never letting out my emotions, because maybe that's why I'm depressed now? I just wish I could have closure from this situation and I have no idea what to do. I wish I could draw some meaning from it, but I can't seem to. Does anyone have any take on this? Or advice on what to do?",12Oct2017,1
3,"So before I start No, im not 3edgy5me and think ""I don't care about ANYTHING"", or think im some kind of sociopath or something. But I do question it sometimes.

Basically the best way to think about it, is I feel like I have a very neutral range of emotions. I feel happy/sad obviously. But....it's like the amplitude of these feelings isn't very high or low. Which is both a good and a bad thing. For instance I had 4 close family members die this year (two grandparents, aunt and uncle). To me I knew logically they would die, so when it happened I felt sad....but not to a great extent, they were all in poor condition and of course I saw this as better than them suffering. I was very close to my grandmother and grandfather. I didn't cry or anything...but I still felt sad they were gone (fond memories and so forth).

Another good instance is with my wife (which this brings a lot of tension between me and her). She's a very emotional and sensitive woman. I do love her very much, but....I feel a lot of times I don't feel as wide of a range of emotion about things as she does, or what other people seem to. So when she gets upset sometimes I don't really feel.......sad? But I know I need to comfort her so I try to. We've had arguments because sometimes it feels hard to understand what she really needs. Im still a good husband to her but it def. causes friction sometimes.

Is there a term for this? I mean it's not like it's ""bad"" per se, since I don't really get mad or aggravated easily (very few things bother me), but I guess I don't get the other end either. I've heard people refer to a similar feeling when being on beta-blockers (but I don't take any meds). 

Thanks!",12Oct2017,1

I make shit money although I'm intelligent and have 3 degrees because this job is something i like and think is getting me get back on my feet. Though last year my review (paper with 1 to 5 scales on how you're doing) was all threes. Including not talking enough to customers from amxiety and not putting enough books away because of my ocd. My ocd will take over and I'll arrange shelf spaces to correct inaccuracies. I thought my review was going to be good on word of my boss but another higher up told me i was going to get screwed again. I dont know what to do as im trying really hard and everyone but the boss ( who is on ths verge of being fired herself) seems to overlook my known mental illness and deduct points for it.  

If anyone can help me with american with disability info pertaining to mental illness, promotion or pay, overall things that a company can and can't do. Please help me!

That can afford accommodations, like my asking not to be a cashier or have to deal with lots of people although i do have to now anyway!

6,"Hello Reddit. I’m a twelve year old girl, and I’m scared.  I guess you guys need some background information, so here we go. 

I’ve always been a reader. I started to learn how to read when I was two (granted, I wasn’t able to read The Very Hungry Caterpillar until I was four and had spent two years staring at the words, but still.) I’ve always loved stories, wether I was watching a movie, reading a book, or being read a book. I had friends as a very young child, but I was very prideful and because my brother had taught me tons of what he had learned at school I caught on easily. I truly never felt like part of the group, except for in second grade when I became best friends with a boy that was much smarter than me, but understood me when I talked about Astronomy. 

In third grade I made kinda failed attempt at fitting in. It worked, my classmates saw me as an equal, but I still felt like an outsider. That year for I Love to Read Month my brother lend me his copies of the Percy Jackson books. I was immediately immersed in the story. That was when I started really getting into reading. I would read anything I could get my hands on. Because I spent most of my time reading fantasy, I started to wish that I was part of those magical worlds, and therefore started pretending that I was part of these stories. I would do this when I was alone in my room and slowly I built a world of my own. 

In fifth grade I read the Harry Potter books, but at that point I wasn’t a super big Potterhead. But I did start to pretend that my friends from all the books that I’d read and that I’d created were real. I would talk to them in my mind and when I was alone I would talk to them aloud. 

In sixth grade I became the ultimate Harry Potter fangirl. I’m pretty sure by now that I have an obsession with all eight books. By the end of sixth grade I felt more alone than ever, and my imaginary friends that had been gone for a few months came back. Then, over the summer, I became a lot more Harry Potter obsessed. I started feeling just so miserable because I couldn’t go to Hogwarts. Not only that, but when I re-visited the Percy Jackson books I felt an unexplainable feeling that felt like butterflies in my stomach. They would flutter all around my stomach and sometimes fill my lungs and crawl up my throat, not letting me breathe properly. 

Then seventh grade started. I’ve never been good at social interaction, so when two of my friends had birthday parties I wasn’t looking forwards to it. But I still went to the parties because I didn’t want to offend them. During both occasions, my mind drifted to my imaginary friends and the books I’d read, and at that moment he butterflies began. I just couldn’t focus on the party anymore and felt alienated from my friends. 

Ever since things have taken a turn for the worst. I’ve started getting a feeling of longing, kinda homesick. I’ve concluded that it might be homesickness for Hogwarts or Camp Half-Blood or the places I’ve created in my mind. That makes the most sense, as one day, and one day only, i couldn’t look at any book but my textbooks without feeling a pull towards it, like I’m gonna be sucked into a wonderful fictional world. 

It’s scaring me, to be honest. I feel as if I’m going crazy. The feeling has started to keep me up at night. To top it all off, since my imaginary friends know me better than anyone and can read me like a book, my real friends can’t really compare to them. It’s not their fault really, after all, they’re not products of my imagination. Now I just feel constantly alone and I’ve even cried because of it a couple times, and I don’t cry very often. 

I don’t know if I just have a really good imagination and am really lonely, or if I have an actual problem. I know the internet is nothing compared to an actual doctor, but I want confirmation that this is not normal before I tell my parents. I really don’t want to tell my parents given that my mom has always though that mental disorders are just excuses for un properly raised people. Please, help me. I don’t want to make a fool in front of my parents.

A few days ago i went out with some friends and drank alot of beer, and the next day i felt like my medication stopped working and it still feels like its not working.

10,"Hey Reddit!

I am on a low dose (100 mg) of Lamictal for Bipolar disorder type 2.

To be honest, I have felt more stable since taking it. But I don't know if it's necessary. Sometimes I think my depressive episodes were circumstantial. That my suicidal thoughts were a cry for help as opposed to an actual urge to end my life. I also feel that it was partially due to my being dramatic.

I have an impulsive personality, which my psychiatrist attributed to mania. However, if I were to have manic episodes I would never say they were the elated ""I'm on top of the world"" type. I've been in abusive relationships and have experienced multiple episodes of sexual abuse since puberty onward to high school. If I were to consider any of my behavior ""manic"" then it would have been the rage I experienced in my relationships which were completely wrong for me. I fell in love for the first time with this girl after finally coming out to myself at age 20. She was completely wrong for me and a pathological liar on top of that. Her lies and inability to communicate would frustrate me and because I finally loved someone for the first time, I felt like we were destined to be together and so I would lose control. 

I really believe my behavior was due to lack of self control and discipline and is something that can be corrected.

I've gone to bipolar support groups and I felt entirely out of place. I felt sympathy for everyone once I heard their stories and it made me wonder if I have merely been dramatic about how I feel. 

When I hit puberty in middle school, I built friendships through my cries for help. And I think it built a habit for me to receive companionship and reassurance from others rather than be independent and take sole ownership of my life.

I don't want to depend on medicine. I have no issue with taking them, but the pharmaceutical industry is fucked. I only saw my psychiatrist once when I received my lamictal prescription. The woman hardly even knew me and interpreted my behavior from her psychiatric background.

How do I go about this?",12Oct2017,1
11,"I have a pretty good social life, if I want it. But I secretly hate most of the people who are nice to me. I'm so lonely I could cry, even when I'm surrounded by people. So I drink - alone, or with people, in order to deal with them. How do I get over this? Am I mentally ill? But aren't people who just love everyone around them kind of delusional? That's why I have trouble accepting that there may be something wrong with me. I don't get how being wildly optimistic about human society is the ""normal"" state.",12Oct2017,7
12,"So I don't know how I got paranoia, but I got it, and it is horrible. I don't know how to describe it, so I'll just provide examples of it. At one point, I thought my cat was a demon sent to spie on my, I would hold the cat down and yell at it, telling it I know what it was (don't worry, I didn't hurt it). I use to think there were cameras in my house watching me, and that my family was actors that were supposed to watch me, so I tried killing myself to see if they would see it on the cameras and run in to get me. I use to think my parents were poisoning my food, I can't hang out with friends without bringing a knife because I don't trust them not to gang up and try killing me. I also use to think I could see into the future sometimes, and that God wouldn't let me die because there was something he needed me to do. And the last thing is, I got a new girlfriend about 3 weeks ago, and I'm constantly paranoid that she doesn't like me, or that she's bored of me. I sent her a text half an hour ago and she hasn't replied, even though she was active on Facebook messenger, and so no I'm paranoid she's cheating or some shit... So is there any way to over come paranoia, and does this sound like it could be something more than paranoia?

I was just doing some thinking and talking with a friend and I've always had anxiety issues, mostly social anxiety but I tried to think of the last time I felt no anxiety and I couldn't think of it. Like years and not an hour where I felt truly calm. How normal is that?

Also my mind doesn't differentiate between good and bad experiences well. so even when a good thing happens to me I get anxious and my body kind of goes into flight mode and downplays it or flat out avoids it. I don't know if any of this makes sense to anyone else but my friend said I should go to a dr. What could it be? Normal? Not?",12Oct2017,2

18,"So I have been self diagnosed with depression for about 10 years. I’m 23 and female. 

When I was 21 I finally talked to a professional and she diagnosed me with major depression and anxiety. I started taking Fluoxetine 40mg and have been taking that for 2 years. 

About 6 months ago I went to a different doctor and he also stated that yes I have major depression and anxiety. He tried to prescribe me things that he thought would work well for my anxiety and were supposed to calm me down (klonopin and possibly lorazepam I can’t exactly remember) klonopin made me very angry which wasn’t supposed to happen. So he then diagnosed me with ADHD and prescribed me 20mg adderall XR.

I still don’t feel right. Here are my symptoms:
Some days I am happy, some days I’m down.
Probably a few times a year I’m angry and suicidal.
Some days my mind is racing and other days my thoughts are clear. Literally every day I wake up I feel different and I can’t predict at all how I’ll feel. at work some days I’m extremely productive but others I literally do nothing. I can’t keep a hobby for longer than 2 weeks. Sometimes during the year I’m extremely social but most of the time I’d rather be at home alone. I go through periods of “I wana Travel the world” “I want to learn to paint” “I want to dye my hair a crazy color” but two weeks later my thoughts and opinions have completely changed. 

If I can describe anymore or you have any questions please let me know I just really want to get someone else’s opinion on what I could have.",12Oct2017,0
20,"So i'm quite busy as a 17 year old. I graduated high school a year early. Right now I have work full time and college online full time. I make daily youtube videos, but I haven't been consistent on it the past month. I have a hard time decided the most ridiculous things ever. Yesterday, it took me all day to somewhat decide how I wanted to separate these videos into different series. Sure youtube is my passion and I should take it fairly serious and have fun, but it shouldn't take me 12 hours to decide how to title my videos. Or if I need to copy this template to the other hard drive? There are some bigger things that are harder to decide, like if I want to quit Karate which has been there for me since I was 7 and it's always been a part of me. I can't decide on a schedule. I've tried to schedule myself in time frames, but it never works. I've tried to do a daily to-do list, I've tried so many ways, but I can't keep myself to actually do what needs done. Now I do complete my college work, which is really the only important thing, but still. It'd be nice to get some videos done on time for once.

27,"Hello everyone,


First of all I just want constructive advice on how best to tackle these issues and refrain from telling me how bad a person I am. I am completely aware but is the first time I'm admitting this all to myself.

&amp;nbsp;
I'm a 24 year old woman with a long history of various mental health problems. Namely, I developed OCD when I was roughly 8 years old (mostly obsessive cleaning), and although it was recognised by my mother, she hoped it would disappear, which it did. But it manifested into other various issues but I didn't go to a therapist until I was 20.


- Generalised anxiety disorder: I have always had this and went on various medicine before finding Citalopram 2 years ago (after suffering the aftermath of an unwanted abortion) which really worked. I came off this 2/3 months ago and am feeling more calm and more in control of my emotions.
- Body Dysmorphia: from about 13 - 20 years old, I became negatively obsessed with my appearance and used to spend hours crying in front of a mirror. 
- Depression: I had some bouts when I was a teenager and often thought about suicide. 
- More recently diagnosed - PTSD: I got pregnant in January 2015 after being with my boyfriend for 6 months and had an abortion which I regretted. I had only been living abroad for 9 months when this happened and so was far away from any support from family. It drove me into being an absolute train wreck and after 9 months after suffering I finally went to a psychologist back in the UK to ask for help - she put me on Citalopram. 

&amp;nbsp;
The main issues I'm dealing with right now (I have literally just faced up to this last night/this morning after being caught out and thinking shit, what am I doing):


- Stealing: I think I first stole something when I was about 10 years old. I stole a few things here and there through my teenage years but it hasn't been until the past 2 years, I have gone full throttle on the stealing. It's not like I don't realise how bad it is but I actually feel ""proud"" about being able to get away with it so easily. I'll steal literally anything I can from shops but I found the easiest are some clothes shops which don't electronically tag. I have worked out a system - when best to go, what bag to take, what changing room to go in etc. I will take anything from 3chf (I'm in Switzerland) to 150chf and I've racked up clothes, jewellery and accessories in the thousands. The thing is, I have a job and earn decent money. I could go on to justify why I do it, but I just am confused as to why I do it in the first place.
- Lying: I am a compulsive liar. I lie about small and big things every day. Such as having a headache. And I impulsively told my friends I had a neurological disorder (I did actually have to have an MRI to check for neurological damage because I was having bad neuralgia, but it came back clear). I've lied about SO many things, and then I have to keep up with it. 
- Cheating: The thing that's made me realise all of this - I cheated on my boyfriend. We have been going through a massive rough patch following my mental breakdown after the abortion which drove him away from me emotionally. There were a lot of other reasons why the relationship was turning shit that were not all my fault but I decided to move out, and we decided to see each other much much less because I was feeling nothing but anxiety around him. I decided I wanted to break up, but he begged me to stay and at least try to just see each other once a week for a while. I said yes, stupid I know.

&amp;nbsp;
About 3 weeks ago I finally got my sex drive back and I went crazy... masturbating about 2/3 times per day and constantly thinking about sex (it was at zero for 2 years) - I can only assume this was because of coming off of all medication (Citalopram and birth control). 

&amp;nbsp;
Now the really fucked up part which is literally a blur - 2 weeks ago I took several explicit photos of myself, signed up to a couple of hook up/kink websites and created another email account so that people could contact me there. I arranged to hook up with guys on my next trip back to the UK in a couple of weeks. Now I know I'm a liar, BUT I would not actually ever go through with this. It was like a short-lived fantasy - it was exciting and fun. But again, what was I even thinking? I didn't even think about how wrong it all was. In brief, my boyfriend found out last night about everything because I didn't conceal it very well. He still wants to be with me however I need to seek professional help and change. Without a doubt, I need to end the relationship to avoid hurting him further. I just want to add that I have not been single before - I have been in 3 relationships one after the other since I was 14 years old. 

&amp;nbsp;
So, now I've explained everything, my real question is... do I need to seek help for this or am I just a fucked up individual? 
It would all make more sense if my external self was also fucked up but it's not. I am empathetic and caring with the people I love, very sociable, patient, friendly, I eat well and take care of image.

&amp;nbsp;
I live on the Swiss/ French border, and I cannot actually afford to pay for a psychologist/therapist (which is not included in insurance). Do I move back to London and seek help there? Or have I just turned into a really terrible person and need to figure this out on my own?

Any help is appreciated.

TL;DR I have a history of mental illness but the past 2 years I've turned into a stealing and lying mess. And I just recently got caught cheating on my boyfriend (online).

28,"I'm currently in the worst state I've been in ever, yes there is a girl involved though I believe she's more of a conduit than anything else. A short back round is that I was raised in a Scientology house hold where mental illness' do not exist and everything is your fault for the way you are. I have really bad anxiety and this is a fact I've had to come to terms with. Even now simply writing a rather anonymous post sets me on edge. To the point. I've become overly attached to someone I've known for a week, I know logically my flaws and how unhealthy this is but emotionally I cannot handle the attachment. I have strong urges to be aggressive and expend as much energy as possible, at the same time I cannot eat or sit still. I had incredible anxiety when I was not responded to after a few (6) hours and had to literally sprint for a few miles to get try to get rid of this feeling. She has expressed that she is not good with commitments and does not wish to pursue a (titled) relationship, this is fair and can be respected, but at the same time wants me to be single as well so we can retain what we have. Part of my anxiety issues is my good reasoning and deductive reasoning skills along with an over-active imagination. I mention this because it has ruined two of my relationships to date. I simply cannot handle the type of FWB relationship she wants because I cannot handle the thought of anyone else having the same relationship with her (she has already sent me snapchats of her on other dates). I do respect this is her choice and I wont push it further but I am stuck between a complete separation (which is really difficult with my anxiety) or a self torturous relationship with her (also caused by my anxiety). I feel as though (like I said before) she is merely a conduit for pent up emotion and personal issues. I have never been an emotional person and it is hard for me to feel them as they simply come out as physical symptoms rather than emotions. I am getting help and have been for a couple months but I've also never been in this bad of shape. I cannot do anything in public by myself without forcing it, and I feel as though I'm going crazy yet I also think insanity would be a blessing to remove this constant, pervasive whirlwind that has rooted inside. 
TLDR: Really bad anxiety, cannot handle emotions, feel like crazy.

31,"First time posting on here... doubt if anyone will read it tbh. I have no one to talk to so I'm just going to say it all here.
I'm a teenage girl (Not going to specify an age as I don't really want personal info on here). I have various mental health issues including depression. Recently the doctors increased my meds to double what I was taking, but right now I'm feeling more sad and alone than ever.
I find myself wishing I could just fall asleep and never wake up. I don't want to die because I'm scared  of it, I just wish I'd never been born in the first place. 
Recently I've been feeling really unwell and I fainted the other day, I have no energy and my appetites gone. When my mom saw me lying down yesterday because I felt so ill, she shouted at me and said I was stupid for doubling the pills (we think they might  be why I'm feeling so ill) but I just did what the doctor advised... She also shouted at me that she was going to control my diet because I don't eat good enough (being someone who actually suffered with an eating disorder and still has relapses, someone controlling what I eat sounds a nightmare for me, I know she's only trying to look after me but it made me feel even worse. I'm already at an all time low and I don't want to slip back into starving myself again as a way of coping). After she finished I went upstairs and cried myself to sleep.
Now I'm sat here in bed because I'm too exhusted and light headed to get up for a shower and I'm just thinking what is the point. What is the point in actually being here, maybe it would be better to be dead, maybe it will just be like sleeping.
I seriously wish I'd never been born in the first place, my mum says that I was the one who won the race when being conceived. I really wish I hadn't, I didn't mean to.
I also suffer with depersonalisation derealization syndrome / disorder. I'm struggling with that too and I find it really hard to talk to my parents about it because they don't understand. 
I have no energy left to fight anymore.

Is there a painless way to die? 
I just want this all to be over.

If you have read this then thank you, is there anyone out there like me? Does anyone know how to die without it feeling like dying?
I don't know if I can last much longer.

34,"I didn't always have this issue. Its more of a recent thing, in the past few weeks probably. I think they started because I had dreams about my ex. Dreams where we'd be dating again and he would tell me he loves me and always will (stupid fucking high school promises) and I tell him that he leaves me for his best friend and even while with his best friend he continues to be sexual with me just to fulfill his needs and I let him because I'm desperate for him in my life. And he never believes me, he always goes ""what? No, that will never happen"" even though I saw it happen right in front of me.

Because I started having these dreams, I guess I started thinking of him more. Like I would be confusing times I spent with my ex and with my current boyfriend. Or I would remember what I did with my current boyfriend recently, and my ex would pop into my head.

I don't want to think of him. Im done with him. He was an asshole and just awful for me, and I was too stupid and desperate to let him go when I should have.

But the fact that I'm thinking him is making me scared that I'm somehow using my current boyfriend as a sort of rebound. Im constantly questioning whether or not I really love him, questioning if I really should be with him. Im always telling myself that if I loved him then I wouldn't be thinking of my ex. In short, its starting to make me lose confidence in my relationship when it hasn't been an issue throughout the entirety of my relationship.

Im apprehensive and anxious to tell my current boyfriend about these thoughts. I already feel I don't deserve him because he's so fantastic and he goes out of his way to make me feel better on my frequent bad days, and I never reciprocate because he never has bad days, he always seems to handle his life a million times better than I can. I don't want to make him worry about me any more than he has to... I don't want to stress him with my stupid thoughts.

Im hoping they'll go away, but I'm really worried that they never will, and I'll be stuck with feeling this guilt for a long time, or at least until I can't take it and end the relationship. Ive tried ending the relationship before when I felt immensely guilty about weighing him down with my ever-present depression, and he refused to let me break up with him because he didn't want to leave me, he loves me and refuses to leave me because he cares for me so much.

I just feel so awful about everything. I feel like its my fault that I'm thinking about my ex. I feel like if I were a better girlfriend or person in general, these thoughts wouldn't even come up...",12Oct2017,1

1. Anxiety – Fears dictate how she thinks, acts, and lives her life. One time when she was home alone, she had a panic attack. My mom is diagnosed with generalized anxiety and she sees a therapist on occasion. (As a side note, my dad is greatly affected by my mom's mental health. This is a separate issue.)

2. She very often wants hugs from me, her brother. Which isn’t that weird in it of itself, but it’s not like a normal brother/sister hug. I’m not referring to a sexual connotation, but it’s like she seeks a form of validation that manifests itself through physical touch and affection. I don’t like to give her hugs because I feel like I’d be “fulfilling her needs” or she’d be “getting something out of it.” I don't like to do it because it feels like i'm being used. My dad gives her hugs often.

3. Selfishness – She is not very considerate. Her maturity is lagging behind her age, so she’s sort of like a high schooler in this sense.

4. Superiority / Inferiority complex – This one is hard to describe, because these two things are opposite.  She think’s she’s right all the time, but she struggles with self-confidence. She’s extremely defensive if you give her slightly criticism, and she will attack back without thinking. Sometimes she will say things about you that aren’t relevant to the topic at hand just because she feels like she has to attack you back. Perhaps she has little remorse and maybe she has no realization about what she's saying. 

5. She’s very indecisive and doesn’t really know herself. She doesn’t really know what she wants, in most things. She doesn’t have any hobbies. She does a lot of online shopping and Netflix as an outlet/time killer.

Do you guys have any thoughts or advice? Would you recommend a therapist/counseling? Thanks in advance.

36,"See, I am a programmer. I am stuck with a work that I know can be completed in next half hour for past 1 week. Its pretty simple and straightforward to complete it. But I just couldn't make myself do it. Its not like I am lazy, last month I pulled a really complicated stuff all my own. But now I couldn't. I quit my last company because of the same problem. I wasn't able to consistently deliver stuff. I just couldn't make myself do something that is essential. Do anyone else feel the same way? Am I just lazy? What's happening? I don't want to go down like this. I wanted to fix my life style. I moved to a different city/country to fix this motivational problem. Now its coming back again. Please help",12Oct2017,9
38,"I know you’re not supposed to self diagnose and I really don’t want to, plus I feel like labels (referring to mental health) are unnecessary because there is no such thing as the perfect human being and because they can be used in a very negative way...

But after doing weeks of research using credible sources, the things I have dealt with for the past few months are the same symptoms of Quiet/Introverted/Acting-In Borderline Personality Disorder. I am not clinically diagnosed with anything, but I have been depressed for almost 2 years now and have had anxiety and social anxiety related issues for a year and a half now. I do plan to go speak to a psychologist soon because my mental health seems to go back and forth, but I feel has overall gotten worse. 

My boyfriend and I had a talk because our relationship has some issues that are due to my mental health and my behavior because of it. The conversation left the impression that he will leave if things do not get better (which I completely understand. All I want for him is to be happy and receive the love he deserves, even if that means being with someone else). That terrified me and made me so angry and ashamed of myself for not being able to be or at least act normal despite trying to change. I had never felt so disgusted with myself that when he left to run errands, I cried and then, without thinking, started slapping and punching my face. 

I have never done that before in my entire life until that day, and it horrified me what I’d done to myself. It horrified me more that I initially enjoyed it. I have never self harmed before until that day, and it has been an extreme wake up call that I need to do something now before it gets worse and something seriously bad happens.

I need advice. Anything. I just want to get better, you know? For the sake of my sanity, myself, and for the people I love dearly because my problems are affecting my relationships and I don’t know what to do. 

TL;DR: Not trying to self diagnose or necessarily encourage the use of labels for mental health, but the experiences I have done through the past few months are all symptoms of quiet bpd. Affecting personal relationships. Started self-harming. I’m terrified and I would like advice on what I should do. Please?",12Oct2017,6
41,"My gf and I have been together for 8 years. She has very serious anxiety and I love her very much. I have learned a lot through the years about loving someone with anxiety, the do's and dont's and all that. 

My problem is that I am usually a very mentally stable person. However, recently I have come to hate my job, and struggle with life in general. It has caused me to become increasingly distant with her because I do not want to unload my struggles onto her. She has obviously noticed and wants me to be more vocal but I know that she already has so much that she is dealing with internally. Also when I have tried to share my issues she tends to compare my struggles to hers and dismisses mine entirely; or lack the compassion/support that I need in general.

On top of everything, I have not been able to be the support system for her either as I am currently struggling and am just not myself.

The total result of all of this is a quiet, frustrating, sometimes explosive home life.

I don't know what to do so I came here.",12Oct2017,2
44,"I was an alcoholic for many years, and it caused me to make lots of regrettable decisions, and to lose my friends, job, social standing, a 9-year relationship, and everything I hold dear.

Many times, I have contemplated and attempted suicide. I was admitted to the psychiatric ward at 3 different hospitals on at least 6 separate occasions. Cyber-bullying and online ‘trolling’ is largely to blame for this. I hear “Kill yourself, faggot/p.o.s./degenerate scum” in some variation ~20 times a-day.

I respect the trolls’ right to free speech, and am not trying to take that away; I am just asking that people be more sensitive and empathetic when interacting with vulnerable individuals online. Unless you’ve walked a mile in their shoes, you don’t know what demons they’re battling.

I have made a lot of bad decisions in the past, but I am endeavoring to make amends for them. Sometimes it feels like I’ve done irreversible damage and that my life is still unsalvagable, but I am choosing life, and divorcing myself from my old, obnoxious identity.

I am registered with the Canadian Mental Health Association, and am recovering with the aid of Social Workers, Psychiatrists, Addictions Counsellors, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and Music Therapy. CMHA is a wonderful organization that hosts free recreational activities that afford reclusive people, such as myself, the opportunity to meet like-minded people.

I have also benefited from Depression and Autism chat rooms, where sympathetic persons have literally talked me out of suicide.

If anyone can relate to my struggles, I urge you to register with an agency like CMHA, and to be courageous and speak out about your challenges.

45,"I have nightmares nearly every morning. I've noticed they aren't at night, they are in the morning if I wake up a little, realize I have more time to sleep, and go back to sleep for a bit.

Sometimes they're based on actual worries, which is understandable, but sometimes they're super random and once I wake up I realize their content wasn't even scary.

They are all incredibly vivid, I'll wake up and feel out of it all day because I was so deep in the dream.

46,"It all started 5 years back. I was bullied cause my language was different and I was a shy boy. The reason why I became shy maybe was related to my newly discovered masturbation at the age of 14. I became shy and less visited out to play games with children my age. I had a fulfilling life before that I was normal was outgoing and had many friends. I was good at studies too. But after being bullied my results declined. Before I was a topper was good at studies to cause I was hard working. Every day was mental torture for me for almost two years but I didn't notice any metal changes I was doing almost fine but maybe I had anxiety. I use to masturbate almost daily to get a relief from this. Next year I was all bad at studying I cant even see my book I used to not study even for 1 year and I was a student. I wanted to but I couldn't. I searched a bit and found that it was all because of my over masturbation I was addicted and soon I got anxiety as my teachers were every day asking me questions and I was shamed every time. I developed anxiety then I guess. I became socially awkward too. I passed my 11th with fewer marks then next year 12th same and I dropped and started studying again one more year. I knew what my problem was and started abstaining from fapping but I was not too successful I started taking supplements which did help me supplements like ashwagandha and fish oil and vitamin b along with zinc almost every day for many months. I was able to focus and passed 12th. My brother was in same class with me I had always felt insecure during that time. I dropped and was again studying with my brother. Fast forward now next year after I passed 12th I am noticing many problems. Mainly brain fog, Slow thinking, inability to recall things, even many English words. English is not my primary language but my vocabulary is affected. My learning speed is affected, I cant recall famous actors my favourite actor's name someday. My short term memory is good some days and I can remember everything I am taught or studied but next day when I wake up I almost forget 70% information.Even after many revisions, I cant recall. My friends on the other had can recall tough names I could 1to2 years back but now I cant. I need my brain as I am pursuing a medical career. I cant do sometimes even basic sums. I feel low most time. I just can't motivate myself. I became very sensitive person offended very easily and most of the time I try to keep others happy and get unhappy myself. I don't have friends. Only teachers call my name no one else. My name no one calls that. And I don't know why but many like to tease me maybe cause I am big in size and people like to dominate. Batlle with words I am not good at cause abusing other I hurt myself too. And when someone abuses me I just zone out and cant even reply. I feel like I should be respected I know I don't deserve it but at least a little if I don't feel like talking with anyone others should not tease me badly. I know I am different but not everyone knows me to judge me. I am just one step away from ruining my life. Academically I thought I will prove it. But I just cant no matter how much I study. I just dream one day my brain will be clear and I cant find happiness in my life loneliness is too much when I don't have anyone to talk to. I cant approach anyone I had the guts in past but now I think they will just make me feel bad. I want to be happy do meditation, cold shower and even stopped masturbation for many months now but nothing happened. I am losing hope. I hope someone can help me. Please tell me I have a very bad disease which can be cured with a magic pill. I do feel thirsty past few years a lot and maybe I am an emotional eater. I am overweight and I am tall too.

50,"Just typing my thoughts...

With Mental Health Day having been this week, I've recently been letting myself be more open with how I feel and why. I've never had someone in my life that I felt able to talk with about my how I feel, so I've finally decided to take advantage of my college's counseling center.

I've been thinking about what it is in my life that makes me feel so down all the time and how I deal with it. One thing that I've been doing for quite a while but have never given myself the chance to think too deeply about... is constantly moving. 

I get out of class and go to the library to work. I sit down for 15 minutes or so, decide that the atmosphere's not working for me, and leave to go back to my apartment. Or I'll go to another study space, decide it's not working for me either, and move again. I'll be in my room, unable to focus, and decide to go to the library, only to not feel motivated to do work there either. I'll plan to stay on campus for a weekend, then change my mind suddenly and drive 40 minutes home, and stay there for an hour before heading out again to go to a coffee shop or back to campus.

It just seems like I can't stay settled in one space for too long, and I'm constantly on the move. Even though I do it to get into a ""better atmosphere"", it never pans out and I feel like I'm just wasting my time but I can't stop. I get frustrated when I can't stay focused, and just end up getting even more frustrated when I go somewhere else only for the same thing to happen. 

Ultimately it ends up with me getting nothing done and feeling numb by the end of the day, but I just don't know what to do. I used to be able to stay motivated when I need to be, and I just can't now.",12Oct2017,1
51,"So, we do in fact live in a society that stigmatizes people for having (visible/expressed) mental health issues. 

Firstly, and drawing from my own experience, depression (a common issue) can largely result from living in departure from one's values and genuine needs. 

(Imo) we live in a society that does not (in mass) acknowledge peoples' needs (even fundamental physiological ones) sufficiently, outside of mainstream behavior. Whenever we do so it can easily be perceived as ""counter-culture,"" ""new-agey,"" or ""special-snowflakey.""

People should in fact eating certain kinds of foods (and not others),  they should be exercising (intensely and at least somewhat socially), they should be getting sun and going outdoors/into nature (if possible), they should be using their brains and learning and growing cognitively and emotionally through a variety of constructive, challenging, pro-social activities. They should be confronting fears, stretching themselves, and exploring. They should be sleeping regularly, sufficiently, and deeply each night. 

The above prescribed not for some distinguishment or personal enchantment, but because this is how we optimally maintain our overall physiology and psychology as human beings, and even *selectively express our genes* (look that one up if you're unfamiliar). 

Now, yes, we often notice demands (in large part perceived) that would hinder one's ability to fulfill all of those requirements to an ideal degree (which isn't necessary). 

That's another thing. People in large part seem to internalize that they must think in terms of images, defined expectations, and absolutes. ""If you eat healthy you are *this* kind of person with *these* kinds of necessities. You do it (most likely) for *these* reasons so you should buy *this* thing and hang out with *these* people. You are *totally* different from people who *don't* drink spirulina and wheatgrass smoothies for breakfast."" 

Same thing with mental health. People come to think about every aspect of their perception and their existence (quite the meta ladder) through at least somewhat socially constructed lenses, or at the least through shaped through their own experiences. 

One of the best treatments for my mental health problems/destructive thought patterns has been, well, the will to consistently and effectively treat them through the absolute best means I knew I had available to me (the lifestyle stuff above, CBT, rigorous journaling, selective counseling, progressive socializing/engagement in new hobbies, self acceptance practice, etc). And where did that come from? 

*Well, the ability to realize that poor mental/emotional/hormonal health is not a reflection on my person*, outside of my doing what's good for me and what I agree with. I don't know how common this is, but I used to label and confine myself all the time for struggling with these things. I (and those around me at certain times) would construct my identity and, well, my life, based on that fact. And this was a very, very poor and unintelligent response to it. No matter how you are perceived by yourself or others, **you must deeply believe that as a living person you, as well as others, deserve to make whatever you want of yourself and of your life within practical and ethical considerations.**

So: We stigmatize and categorize mental illness, as we do with a lot of things in society (whether to peoples' honor or degradation). As I have studied, mental illness is in large part treatable, in fact even curable (and ofc preventable) in many cases, through the effective meeting one's physiological, cognitive, and emotional/relational needs. 

There is NOTHING wrong (only sane, in fact) with admitting that we need these things, and that, even in challenging situations like tough relationships (esp. non-platonic), tough jobs, tough surroundings (crime, pollution, poverty, etc), we NEED help and progress. **main point #1:** your mental health problems could very well just be a reflection of poor lifestyle. it does *not* mean you are a freak, loser, or whatever other label is shackling you. As a human being, it is your birthright to honor and see to your health and well-being in whatever ways you know how. Having psychological disorders does not make you some undeserving, incapable freak who can't be happy, active, and successful like everyone else. Importantly, **just because it requires extensive effort, exploration, experimentation, and unconventional choices for you to live to your best, that does not invalidate it or make it not worth it.** In other words, having to apply conscious, intelligently determined effort to your struggles/needs, whatever they may be, does not invalidate you as a person, just because it seems like everyone else is having ""such an easy time."" It means you need to change things up and get in touch with your overall health. Do not let ANYONE tell you otherwise.

Now, conversely, your experiences, your awareness, your habitual motivations and thought patterns, your relationships (or lack thereof), the skills you build (or lack thereof), your needs, your 'deep' self--this is all in YOUR hands. An excellent therapist won't just show up to your door. You need to research, contact, and visit them. Healthy, stimulating, and fulfilling social bonds won't just come out of nowhere. You need to find a way to talk to people openly and engage them, and learn the underpinning skills and dispositions to help you do that. Your compulsive/addictive coping habits are not going to just dissolve after reading some self-help. You actually need to make it so that you do the uncomfortable, engaging, *right* stuff with your time and energy and not the numbing, distracting, self-abasing *garbage* stuff that you unconsciously and comfortably do by default to avoid dealing with your issues. You also need to work on discovering what these things are, and on constructively considering your own unique needs and aptitudes, in this regard.

**main point #2:** while mental illness is often shallowly and erroneously judged by many people, and it does not cast you out or make you undeserving or inherently incapable, it is *still* a *reflection* of poor overall health, and **your health and happiness are *your* job**. Even if that means digging into painful self-awareness, memories, childhood, etc. Even if it threatens your defense mechanisms or ego. 

Even if all you can muster is a call to the HOPE line, or better your county's Behavioral Health Dept. Even if you can't concentrate for more than 10 seconds without destructive thinking/emotions taking over. Even if it's all choking you, there are too many constraints, and you just wanna end it all. **You. must. act. In some way.** Even if it's fidgety and misdirected. Just focus on that one thing.

Be your own friend. You are not weak for struggling. You are weak only if you don't at least *try* to do otherwise. 

Now, by the way, for people with REALLY bad cases, I just want to let you know, an optimal lifestyle incorporating everything I mentioned at the beginning of this post is one of the most clear-cut, well-researched, and manageable ways to get yourself to at least a *better* spot than you are presumably in. Plus, they are intuitive and rewarding to implement, and they demonstrate to you that you can and will take care of yourself. Try to make sure you are incorporating as many as possible. I benefitted from the keto diet and I would seriously look it up.

53,"i'm not really sure where to start this post, but i feel the intense need to tell you all how much life is worth living, and how you can improve and make progress like i have.

some back story:
i'm a 17 year old canadian girl who suffers with a variety of illnesses such as anxiety, depression, ocd, and adhd. all pro-dx'd over time.
while i do struggle with some aspects of these illnesses in my life still, i feel like in the past year or so i have really picked myself back up after i've fallen.
around the time i was 10 to 15 years old, i suffered with extreme symptoms and constantly felt like life wasn't worth living. i'm sure some of you know this feeling all too well. i had auditory hallucinations, random breakdowns, you get the deal. i have attempted suicide so many times i have lost count.

but, in the past 2 years or so, i feel like i've drastically improved myself. 

for comparison;

due to my ocd, i wasn't able to do many things.
i could not go anywhere without water to wash my hands with when they felt too dry or sticky.
i could not take off my shoes in the house because of the texture of the floor, nor could i touch other various textures such as fleece, silk, velvet, suede, etc. 

i can now do all of these things- although, sometimes they do kick back into gear when i feel down or in bad shape. despite this, it does not hinder my daily life anymore!

i used to be a complete shut-in as well- i wouldn't leave my house for weeks on end. now i go out at least twice a week, and i feel great about myself.

some people think that when you get therapy and medication, you will instantly begin to improve without any effort. this is not true.

it took a lot of effort on my end to really improve my quality of life. but this does not mean you have to leap huge hurdles to make progress; you can do small things.
whether it means reminding yourself to take your meds every day,
making yourself a cup of tea or coffee to relax,
reading a good self-help book,
or even just idly chatting with a good friend of yours.

for those of you struggling the same way i used to, i want you to know that things *do* indeed get better, no matter how dim the light at the end of the tunnel is right now. it's all about putting in the effort to change.

some things i really recommend to speed up your journey to recovery;

- self-help books!!!!!!
i seriously cannot stress this enough- you can be as picky as you want with these. find one that really stands out to you in a list of many, and read it.
i highly recommend ones about minimalism and decluttering. they say that sometimes, your environment is the biggest contributing factor to your health. some good authors on these topics are; fumio sasaki, nagisa tatsumi, meik wiking, marie kondo, jen sincero, etc...

- indulgence in small things
this sounds like a really vague thing to say, but think about it. what do you like to indulge in occasionally? is it a little cup of tea, a good movie you've loved since you were a kid, looking at pictures of cute animals, wrapping yourself in a nice warm blanket? i recommend doing at least one daily, you can switch it up.

- a responsibility
nothing too huge, but something that at least means something important to you. 
i recommend a pet. i have 3 pet birds, and they keep me going even on days where i wanna give up. they are little sweethearts. a bond with a pet can really feel amazing.

- mindfulness
okay, so if any of you have ever been to bad group therapy sessions, you may not like this word very much because of the shitty dvds they play explaining mindfulness as if you were a toddler.
despite this, it is very important. it's just about approaching it properly- if you feel like meditation is not your thing, that's fine! you don't have to force yourself to do anything like that. even if you just do a small check with your breathing- noticing the speed of which you inhale and exhale- is great. 

- podcasts!!!!!
podcasts are absolutely amazing because they're free, easy to access, and cover a variety of topics. i like to listen to short ones before bed, and long ones while i'm on lengthy commutes or studying. the slow home podcast is a really good one about living a calm, nice life.

i hope this helps and gives some of you inspiration to do good. if you ever need any advice or just want to chit-chat, you can even pm me any time. :D",12Oct2017,2
55,"I broke up with my long-time boyfriend a couple months ago, and I was absolutely devastated. While most of the time I would be OK, when things reminded me of him I would get extremely upset. I also started having mood swings, where I would cycle through a lot of complex emotions at one, and I started engaging in some rather risky behavior on top of all that.

After a while I had to admit that it was all too much, so I did my research and found a therapist who seemed good on paper. The first session was very cathartic, I cried a lot, and got a lot off my chest.

The next two times I came into the office, I wasn't a raw emotional wreck, and not a lot is going wrong in my life, besides my being an emotional mess. So I would explain the things that were upsetting me in a given week, then I'd finish explaining them as best I could, and then my therapist would just not respond. He would just let me sit there in silence. Then instead of actually addressing what I've said so far, he would say that he's grasping at straws for what we should be addressing in therapy.

Is this guy just a jerk, or am I just not understanding what therapy is? He's making me feel like I'm messing this up when I'm still in a lot of emotional pain. Is it worth trying to find another therapist, or did that first session where I was able to connect with how painful the breakup was for the first time do the trick?",12Oct2017,2
57,"I need help identifying the problem I am having. Lately it’s been happening more and more and it’s driving me crazy. Sometimes I will have what I call “episodes” where I get intense bouts of the same thought replaying over and over in my head to the point where it feels like my head is going to explode. When it happens it also really makes my anxiety go insane, so it also causes physical symptoms such as a racing heart beat and sweating. It usually happens if I wake up in the middle of the night. I feel like I’m not making any sense even describing this now but it’s very hard to describe. For example, last night I fell asleep watching a movie and when I woke up to the thoughts it was a particular scene in the movie playing over and over again in my head to the point where I couldn’t go back to sleep or think about anything else. To make it go away I had to concentrate very hard on something else so I started reading a book but it was still replaying in the background of my head. It s weird because the thoughts never have an importance to me, it’s always just a mundane scenario that won’t go away. It’s very scary when it happens because it makes me feel like I’m going insane and I get to the point where I literally want to grab my head and scream and tell my brain out loud to stop.

58,"It's weird how I'm only realizing this now. It's been obvious to me that for some time I've been unhappy with my life in general, but I always attributed it to the stress and my currently very busy schedule as I had to take on a minijob while finishing my Master's degree in physics; 

However, what became even more clear to me just a few moments ago is that I don't enjoy life anymore. Even if I reach my goals I am never more than ""content"" for a very short time, never happy, never looking forward to something. It goes so far that I can imagine myself having my dream job, well paid, and still not being happy because the money won't bring happiness.

I seem to be chasing goals that don't make me happy, but rather ones I selected as ""worthy of striving for"". 

Even when I think about hanging out with friends, in my head it becomes a task of performing well. Everything becomes work, and I think that if I don't treat it as such I will perform badly and not get further. Life as a whole becomes a test.

How do I break out of this without being unable to treat things seriously? How can I start enjoying the good taste of a sweet desert again or some fun activity with friends without worrying that I'm doing SOMETHING wrong? That the snack has too many calories, sugar, or that my friends will think negatively of me for being quiet?

60,"I've been dealing with depression and a generally negative self-image for almost two years now and it's gotten to the point where it's severely affected my relationship and professional life. I've never shared anything like this before so I don't know what's relevant or appropriate or not so bear with me.

I'm male and in my mid-20s. Last year I got into a life-threatening accident where I was hospitalized for a month or so and needed physical therapy for several weeks afterwards. I stayed in communication with my coworkers and once discharged, I worked full time as usual except for a couple hours every other afternoon for therapy. While my coworkers and I were putting in 110%, I was eventually working 16 hour days yet often reminded of how my medical needs were obstructive to productivity. I was strongly suggested to not take a vacation I had planned six months prior, as I had already ""taken off"" so much time for being in the hospital. One of my benefits was unlimited paid time off, and having to defend myself while already overworked and underappreciated was the last straw.

I knew I was burnt out, and already experiencing symptoms (low self esteem, lethargy, trouble focusing, general pessimism). To counteract the feelings of professional inadequacy I decided to pursue a dream I've had since I was little and start my own business. I work in software so the overhead was low and I could start immediately. I fought the symptoms of burnout instead of properly addressing them, and began an unproductive spiral of trying to achieve my goals but being unable to due to self-sabotage. During this time my girlfriend was extremely uncomfortable about this venture but was supportive against her better judgement. I took it for granted and focused on myself, often at her expense. I promised I'd start looking for full time employment within 6 months. 7 months later I still hadn't begin that process.

Earlier this year business began to take off thanks to her consistent reminders to try freelancing and build clientele that way. It worked, and for a couple months I focused entirely on making money and working. 8 months in and I still wasn't looking for work. My girlfriend expressed her strong concern and I started taking on less freelance work and focused more on job applications.

This summer I've been doing nothing but applying, but getting nothing back. It's re-awakened feelings of professional inadequacy and worthlessness, and it makes me feel unworthy of even a rejection letter. Thankfully I have a promising opportunity coming up, and I expect my situation to change very soon.

Which brings me to today. I've been dealing with a lot of low self esteem, negative self-image, general depression, and regret. I hate that I've been so self-centered and lazy in my relationship and careless in my professional career. I haven't been thinking about my future because it's been impossible to see things more than one day at a time. My motivation is shot and I feel like I'm falling apart, crumbling from the inside out while maintaining a smile and sunny disposition.

Right now I can't afford an in-person therapist, but my girlfriend and I agree that I need a 3rd party to talk to. Are there any good online places I can look? I've gotten a pet fish to take care of and it's really helped feelings of inadequacy, since it's something I can take care of and keep healthy and happy. I still have a bad habit of trying to escape reality with video games, but it's not something I can completely remove from my life (nor want to, games are a huge part of who I am). I tend to have poor discipline when I'm in a bad mindset, which ultimately fuels itself and creates a cycle of unproductivity and feeling bad about being unproductive.

So, this is a wall of text. Thanks if you've read through everything. **tl;dr** bad job, quit, burnt out, didn't handle it well, took it out on personal life, dealing with newer feelings of regret on top of existing burnout/depression, don't know great ways to address it",12Oct2017,2
61,"And they're taking me off antipsychotics.

I've gotten to a point where the public mental health system will no longer support me. It's a bit confusing. They suspect I have a personality disorder and that the schizophrenia like symptoms were stress and drug induced that were particularly stubborn to resolve. I've been on anti-psychotics for about 15 years.

I'll see how the medication withdrawal goes then maybe seek therapy if I find myself with new issues. They gave me an outline sheet of the 3 clusters of personality disorders and tbh I could strongly identify with pretty much all of them. Which is consistent with my inconsistent results on personality tests. With a bit of reflection I would lean towards histrionic and dependent with some paranoia.

Last night I got dropped down to 1 mg of risperidone. Wasn't a great sleep. And...I'm a bit wired from that. Had an interesting thought about militant feminists weaponizing man flu to take down the patriarchy. 
Also my libido is ridiculous.

I'm still on a lot of other medications. Sodium valproate is the main one now. Ideally I want to be off all meds. The psychiatrist made it pretty clear he doesn't think I have an underlying biological mental health disorder, or at least i interpreted his comments that way. And with that he said all these mental health meds can only be of some benefit to me. So...perhaps the side effects aren't really worth it if I can create better strategies for managing myself. 

This is really weird. I should probably be relieved to not be schizophrenic. From what I understand my expected recovery is now improved. But I'm still lazy about life so its like...ugh another road to travel of self discovery.",12Oct2017,7
62,"Hello everyone,

Just a typical English teenager- Nothing special, I don't think. But for the last 2+ years I haven't exactly felt happy. I have no real reasons to live.

I've always defaulted to being sad as opposed to being happy for the last &gt;2 years. Like how most people are briefly sad then happy, say because they fail a test, but then become happy again a hour, a day or a week later. Except for me it's quite the opposite; I am briefly happy for maybe a few minutes, hours, or even days (longest time has been 10 days) however I slowly slip back into sadness. Is this normal? 

I almost never think happy thoughts, and when I do they always get overridden by ""realistic"" thoughts- Ones that are 95% pessimism. I sometimes spend up to several hours in one day brooding over my failures.

I often stay up at night thinking about how terrible a person I am. More than once I've cried myself to sleep thinking about how bad a person I am and how i'll never get anywhere in life, only silently begging in my head for something to happen that'll end it.

I haven't attempted suicide, but I think about it often during the day. I even plan in my head complex and intricate things that would aid me in killing myself. But I can never follow through with any suicide plans. I'm too scared of what would happen if I survived an attempt. I suppose that sums me up- Too selfish to help others, too scared, weak and shy to help himself.

TBH, I doubt anyone would seriously care if I killed myself here and now. Most schoolmates wouldn't notice or would be happy about it, maybe one or two might care. I know my parents would be sad, but how sad really? They have another, better, smarter son with more potential in life and in the long run they'd be happier without me existing as a sombre little boy and a money drain.

Am I mentally ill?

64,I was misdiagnosed with depression for years and ruined my life. If it wasn't for my bf I would be homeless. I can't hold down a job or finish a semester of school. I have started a new medication regime with my pdoc treating BP1. Im curious if I could get some sort of disability benefits so I can be a little more independent. I haven't had an income since may when I was first hospitalized.,12Oct2017,8
67,"I was raped at 13 and when I got sent to the counselor at my school she didn't let me talk and told me I was being spoiled (I had terrible panic attacks during school, my rapist was my classmate) and that I had to suck it up. I'm 22 and participated in a family therapy session to help my mom and I broke down. Her therapist asked me to come for an individual session and I'm scared of her thinking I'm a brat too, it makes me very anxious and I just want to curl up in a ball and not go, but I know I have to. Do you think that therapist was the exception or are they all allowed to judge me?",12Oct2017,4
69,"OK, honestly I am a bit flummoxed (is that a word?) on what to do right now with my mental health and work balance. 

I've had issues with my mental health since childhood, it's just been there, and I didn't know it wasn't normal as It's always been normal for me, and with alcoholic parents, the need to act normal was even higher. I've done this pretty well, too well actually, and so now I am 26 and just realized I do not know a thing about how to function while being honest with myself.  So I had a breakdown, went on sick leave for a month, and been without a job since June.

To be clear I have been diagnosed with heavy anxiety and panic, with recurring depression, and tentatively a personality disorder (but she didn't want to write it down without discussing the nuances with other professionals) I also have some minor physical health issues that affect my ability to process nourishment so I am exhausted all the time - but this should maybe fix itself (?).  

I am in treatment to both a psychologist as my ""main"" and a psychiatrist as a backup. They also want me to start a group project and have me on ""queue skipping"" for the next 3 years so I will always be in front for needed treatments - so they clearly think something is serious. My issue is that since I live in Norway I have 2 options with how I want to ask for aid while figuring it out. ""Work money"" that is basically 60% of your previous average pay (which was shit and not liveable), and then I have to be an active job hunter and do every job I'm offered, without taking any health concerns into consideration.  Or I can ask for ""Sick money"", that is a minimum to cover basic things (about $800-1000 a month), this will be as long as I am considered too sick to work and under treatment.  Now there is a third option that is to accept the sick money, and then after a year, to have it transferred to disability, that will basically just mean your doctor doesn't have to send in paperwork each month on treatment and it will be a 10-20 year term instead. also if continued the rest of your life, the same amount just get's transferred as your pension per month after 68 I think. 

I have an appointment with the psychiatrist next week, and she can say I am too sick to work, and I'll get the papers for it, but I am not sure I am? I am not healthy by any means, but I don't want to pretend to be sicker than I am to get disability either. The thought about being paid to work makes me really anxious though, and I can literally taste blood in my mouth when thinking of having the expectation of continuously showing up - and that is the absolute minimum of having a job! So I am leaning on asking to be written down that I am too sick to work - but that also goes against every fibre of my being and how I was raised. 

Sorry for the rambling, but I would love to have an outsiders perspective on what to do. Because I want to work and be able to, so I don't have to ""leech"" of anyone, but at the same time, I don't want to start a job and then get sicker and leave the employer in a pinch. ",12Oct2017,2
70,"I know there’s different names for different types of therapy..I’m not sure what all of them are. Some types of things I want out of therapy are: 
-dream analysis 
-picking apart my past
-picking apart my present 
-I’d like there to be some sort of understanding of a spiritual pursuit in life...I think I have heard of something called transpersonal therapy, and that may be partly what I’m looking for 


What type of therapist should I search for?",12Oct2017,4
71,"Not physically but done said things that upset me.

It's like for all the good things been said and done my mind only constantly goes over those couple of bad episodes....

I guess it's a self protection mechanism, remember things or people that upset you to protect you in future...no need remembering all those good favours often....

So all in all it's a game with our mind, sure can get revenge but that won't stop or help.

How can one stop making their brain constantly get angry with these people even when it's been months or years....",12Oct2017,1
72,"Hello r/mentalhealth. I wanted to say that I have not been diagnosed with anything, but I’m freaking out at the moment and I really don’t want to see an expert. So, I’m a teenager in middle school. I’ve always felt somewhat alone because I’m not good with people, but I have a big group of friends. When I’m with them, I laugh a lot and I’m really outgoing. Sometimes, I feel like I’m not supposed to be here. It’s kinda like I don’t belong here. I feel as if I belong in one of the fictional worlds from the books I read and the movies I watch. Sometimes I get really nervous for no reason because I feel as if I should go “home” even though I am home. But what freaks me out the most is that sometimes I’m daydreaming about being in a book or something and I imagine my best friend in that book is hugging me or putting her arm around my shoulder. And my body feels as if there should be an arm around my shoulder. I can almost feel it, but it’s not there. And that makes my brain feel really overwhelmed and weird. Also, sometimes I feel like everyone around me is stupid and really annoying. And all they do is wrong. And that they should pay more attention to me. I never actually voice these thoughts ‘cause I’ve learned that people don’t like that. Also, I tend to push people away even though I want to be friends with them. I know these last few symptoms might just be part of my personality, but I want all the help I can get and who knows? Maybe they are connected☺️. Anyone now if these are normal for people my age?
