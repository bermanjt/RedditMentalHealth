6,"I am a very anxious person, luckily it's high functioning. I'm proud of myself because a week ago, I made my very first doctor's appointment by myself, I went to it this morning, I managed to talk about all my negative traits without crying, I went to pick up my prescription, and I even managed to have energy left when I got home to do some chores. I am very proud of myself and much happier even in comparison to last week just because I know I can do things and I shouldn't let my mental disorders get in the way if I can control it. My boyfriend is lovely and said we can research psychiatrists when he gets home so I can get further help and pin point the problem. I am so proud and excited to get help and I'm ready to lead a normal life. 

Edit: I also have Borderline Personality disorder but since I haven't been to a doctor since that diagnosis, they decided to take it easy and just start me as a high anxiety diagnosis and we'll work up from there so the benzos or whatever they would've given me doesn't shock my system since I'm sensitive to medication. But having BPD is ultimately what makes this, and every other aspect in life very hard to deal with. ",19Jan2017,23
12,"Hello, 
I am a 19 year old female and have been officially diagnosed with major depressive disorder with psychotic features and generalized anxiety disorder. I am currently on 100 mg of Zoloft and I have recently switched birth controls. I was on the generic for Yasmin but, since the 23rd of December, have been on the generic for Yas. I was doing fine on it until I reached toward the end of the pack. I started to become very hostile, apathetic, severe mood swings, severely depressed and anxious, aggravated, argumentive, tearful, overthinking everything, panic attacks, even suicidal at times. I'm going back and forth as to whether this is just really bad pms that is affecting my mental state or if I'm genuinely going into another episode. This is the first time that I have felt this miserable since my last episode a little over a year ago. This has caused me to be very hostile and argumentive toward my boyfriend who I love very much. It is frightening and concerning to me and those around me. I feel like I have no control over my mind and I am desperate for advice and help. Thank you so much for reading and thank you to anyone who is willing to give me advice. 
Peace and love.",19Jan2017,2

15,"I'm hoping someone has some advice on what I should do/how I can get help.

I've been on sertraline for anxiety and depression for ~15 years, generally 50-75mg/day, and I'm facing the very scary possibility of completely running out of medication. I'm facing a perfect storm of events:

1) My long-term psychiatrist retired and did not renew his license,
2) My old insurance (through Cobra) terminated 12/31,
3) My new insurance isn't active until 2/1 (because NYS of Health massively screwed things up and didn't meet their own deadlines - I have been fighting with them),
4) I could not find a doc to see me before the end of the year,
5) My medication at the dosage I'm supposed to be on would run out the first week in February,
and
6) I've had to go down to 50mg from 75mg because of the fear of running out of medication, and the lower dose isn't cutting it.

I can't even find a psychiatrist that will allow me to make an appointment until I have an insurance ID number for them, which I may not have until a week or more after my coverage goes into effect. Waiting periods around here can be weeks or months. I am so, so scared of running out of medication and facing severe withdrawal, not to mention how terrible I feel on a lower dose.

If I can't get a new prescription before I run out - what should I do? Do I go to the emergency room/urgent care? Is it possible my regular doctor could write me a prescription if I bring in my records, or that a primary care doctor that hadn't seen me before WOULD write me a prescription provided I had my records? (With the insurance switch, I might lose my current PCP too, and I know the office has expressed a reluctance to prescribe anything for someone seeing a psychiatrist in the past...)",19Jan2017,1
17,"So I'm a non-offending pedophile. 

I was abused as a kid, so I know what it's like and what it does to you. That's the main thing that keeps it in check most of the time. But quite often, I really struggle with it. It's not as if you can just avoid children, but they're everywhere. 

I really don't want to ruin some kid's life, nor do I want to ruin my life. 

I don't even really know why I'm posting this, but I've never been able to tell anyone, so here I am. I did tell a shrink once, but they didn't take it well

I've never viewed CP, and I don't plan to. Doing so just increases the demand for more.

Anyway, quite often, I will follow girls around at the store or wherever and leer at them. I know it's fucking creepy, but I can't help it.

I really hate myself for this :(",19Jan2017,63
18,"Hey all,

Thought this would be a good place to ask - had a call from my girlfriend at 9:30am this morning after she'd been on a night out in town last night. She'd gone back to a friend's house with her flatmate at around 5am and was, I imagine, pretty drunk, but then started thinking that she was in a prison and ran off, leaving all her belongings with her housemate (shoes included). 

She was sober enough to recount taking 2 hours to walk home, with people apparently even stopping to give her money because they thought she was homeless. Eventually she got back to the apartment around 9am, and was having delusions about 'being in a prison' until her flatmate got back at 9:30 and told her otherwise, and then she called me.

Things worth noting:

- She's never experienced anything like that before
- She was in a room where they were smoking marijuana, but reckons she didn't smoke any.
- She was seemingly sober, or certainly not wasted, when I spoke to her, which is slightly concerning seeing as she was still pretty delusional until half an hour beforehand.
- She's 22, and probably drinks more than she should. Does not take drugs.

So, simple enough really - should I be worried? I'm not sure if the symptoms of delusion are symptomatic of having her drink spiked perhaps, or if something more sinister is going on mentally. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Cheers - Jake.",19Jan2017,1
21,"Certainly, depression manifests itself in many different ways. Sometimes it has multiple causes and not just one. To elaborate on my question: Is there a way to determine if the depression is caused by some of the things we do, or do we do the things we do because we are depressed? If we change our behavior will that help, or should we focus on the depression itself and hope we correct our behavior once the depression has subsided?

&amp;nbsp;

Just as a simple example:
Someone who is depressed might also have bad personal hygiene and a messy home. Do they have bad hygiene and a messy home due to the depression, or did the bad hygiene and messy home cause the depression? How can we tell?

&amp;nbsp;

Do we cause depression by doing/not doing things, or do we do/not do things as a result of being depressed?

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR Fix my depression to fix my life, or fix my life to fix my depression?

23,"I'll try my best not to go on an emotional rant about my situation, so I will give only details you may need to make a suggestion. I am looking for a suggestion on what kind of help I should seek. I don't know where to start. I have never been to therapy before, but I NEED to do *something* to get me fixed up. 

Here are my concerns and problems:

 * Mentally/physically abusive. This is not as bad as you'd think, but it is still there. It's really when I lose my cool due to anger/anxiety.
 * Anger management
 * Being somewhat controlling (not wanting SO to text guy friends who she doesn't see are gross)
 * Focus problems (medicated for ADHD now, but open to suggestions of it being a symptom of something else)
 * Anxiety (medicated for now, Zoloft, not on it long enough for effectiveness)
 * General discontent, feeling of no purpose, boredom, isolation
 * I guess, feeling like I'm always right. (however, I don't know if this is a ""problem"", *most* of the time I **am** right. Or I will argue a point that can't be disproved, so I *can't* actually be wrong.)
 * PTSD from last breakup (not sure if ""PTSD"" is a good way to describe it, but it's all I could think of.)

My main goal is to fix the problems that will affect my intimate relationships. I do not know if ex is willing to participate in these therapy sessions if able. 

If you would like more details, please let me know. I tried to be as vague as possible so I didn't spill my heart to this subreddit. 

My mother has already suggested EFT, because she has soldier friends who have had very good luck with this particular person. 

If you suggest a therapy, and know of a medication alternative that can be used instead, or in combination with therapy, please let me know. I want to be able to take this information and do some research from the results. 

Thank you",19Jan2017,4
24,"For the last couple years I have been seeking treatment for my mental health issues, which has included taking medication. Since I started that process however, my mind basically has felt like mush. My memory has declined and and it is difficult for me to keep track of everything I need to. Over the last week I have been tapering off of my current (and likely final) medication, which has made this issue worse (among other things, difficult week). I'm hoping once I get this stuff cleared out of my system things will improve a little, but my question for you is, how do you stay on top of your life when you have mental health issues and/or are taking medication? I've tried checklists, routines, numerous apps and still keep making unintentional mistakes everywhere. ",19Jan2017,1
25,"Not sure if this is an appropriate place, but I figured you guys would have some insight

This girl and I have been talking off and on for like a month, things were going great, we went on a date, everything was great

After the date she all of a sudden just went ghost on me, stopped texting me back, cancelled all our plans, etc.

I thought I did something to scare her off or something, until last night. She texted me at about midnight and explained that she suffers from depression, and with everything going on in her life lately, most of which I was already aware of, she started slipping again. And she didn't wanna tell me because she didn't wanna overwhelm or scare me off.

I told her that I really like her and I'll be here for her whenever she needs me, and that she never has to hide that kind of thing from me. I reassured her that she's not gonna scare me off with it. She thanked me for understanding, and that was the extent of the conversation.

Now, I've suffered with depression as well but I understand that everyone is different. I really want to be there as much as I possibly can but I also want to give her space. Like I've thought about at least checking in with her everyday just to see how shes doing, but I'm scared thsys took much. How do I support her through this whole at the same time giving her space?

39,"   I'm honestly afraid for my aunt's life. Her name is Toni, and she has an 9 year old son named Keagon. I believe that Keagon shows signs of a serious mental illness, but I'd like advice as to what exactly he might have and what do to.
   Keagon has acted out against his parents for probably a year or two, but recently, it's gotten a lot worse. Before, Keaton would often act out for what Toni presumed was attention. He wouldn't listen to Toni or anything she said, and would snap back at her. At the time, she thought it was just bad behavior or a rebellious streak. However, Toni's perception of him completely changed after one incident.
   Toni and Keagon lived together alone in an apartment, as Toni was recently divorced. Multiple kids in that building came forward, though, and reported to the police that Keagon had sexually assaulted/ put unwanted sexual advances on them, and one child even reported an actual rape. Toni and Keagon were kicked out of their apartments because of it, and Toni moved in with her parents.
   Ever since about them, it's gotten worse. Keaton has developed a horrible temper, uses language that even adults would consider excessive, and acts out physically; after getting into an argument with his sister (who lives with her father and was over for visitation), he tried to bash her head in with a baseball bat. He's lost any sort of discipline, and at this point I was starting to believe that he may have some sort of mental illness.
   Today, though, Toni came to my father (her brother) and asked for help. She said that she is now afraid of her own son. According to her, he has no respect to her, telling her that he hates her, as well as hitting and kicking her with as much force as he can. While Toni and her recent fiancé were in bed talking, Keagon demanded to be let in and tried to bust down their door with a baseball bat. He abuses their two dogs, enough that they are deathly afraid of him as well. He's even threatened to kill her, other people, and even himself. Yesterday, Keagon even chased Toni through the house with a butcher knife, and threw an arrow at her head. She legitimately thinks the only reason she isn't dead yet is because he's not strong enough to. She's afraid that when he gets violent enough and strong enough, that he will legitimately murder her.
   I came here after hearing this, looking for advice as to what kind of mental disorder could cause Keagon to become such an active threat to himself in others. What might be have? What does Toni do?",19Jan2017,3
41,"I'm 21 and for as long as I can remember between deaths and friends leaving and even the stuff I was told I should feel happy about and whatnot I feel nothing. 

I am always lacking emotion and lately it's been really screwing with me. Even with no  emotion sometimes the littlest things make me feel suicidal is the only word I can think of to describe it. 

Suicidal as in when I'm driving irritated or inconvenience I look at my speed and thin things I'm driving past and wonder if itd be enough to end it. I don't act on it because what's the point? There's no proof that being dead is better than being alive. 

The real reason I'm typing this out though is because this girl I guess loves me. She knows no bounds when it comes to making sure I'm comfortable and she'd be perfect to spend the rest of my life with but the problem is that I can't show emotion I can't even imitate it and she tries to force it out of me.

45,"I have always had a low self esteem and been shy throughout school. I am in college now and seeing a therapist for social anxiety and such. It has been very helpful and my confidence has skyrocketed! But after reading and thinking about life values, I realized the only reason I go to school, workout, seek therapy, and try to improve is to show everybody in my life that I am not a shy loser. This need has come from years of being socially awkward, rejection, and some bullying. I know I should not care about what other people think and I don't as much now. I am just lost. What's the point of doing anything? How should I find purpose? I don't know what I care about now. I wanted for the longest time to rub my success in the faces of others who have wronged me. I fantasized about it all the time. I realize now that's probably not ok because nobody has done anything to me that I cannot get over. How do I find healthy reasons to keep improving?

49,"Hi, let me start off with a little bit of background. I am a 21 year old male, recently single, college drop out. I have been seeing the world in a darker tone(metaphorically speaking). I don't trust many people, I feel like I don't have a purpose (actually more like I know). I can't seem to shake the feeling that I am going to end up very empty inside going towards this path.

I feel like it started when I went to college. I was still dating my then still in high school girlfriend who loved an hour away from my campus. I had been drug free and alcohol free up until this point, I was about 19. My girlfriend was a frequent toker, and I never considered leaving her for it. However, after 2 terms at school, I decided to give smoking weed a chance, I got super stoned that night and I got subway on campus-needless to say it was a good time!  The problem began to arise when I realized how shitty it was paying for weed all the time when I wanted to smoke, which I guess became a pretty big habit. I started smoking before and after classes, skipping sometimes to smoke, keep in mind my school had a vast trail system perfect for my activities lol. 

So the next school year rolls around and my grades started faltering, I then started failing some classes, got academic probation, and the next semester I just gave up for some reason. This is really where it went downhill. 1 semester down and these 2 more to go, I failed utterly the 2nd semester. I got lazier, left town to see my girlfriend more. I wanted to blame weed but I know it's still my choice to smoke. So I got academic dismissal for failing too much, and I also have more school tuition to pay that the financial aid wouldn't pay for because of my grades. Oh ya and all throughout my last year here I had 2 credit cards with $700 limit, and I stopped caring and maxed both of those out with the help of my girlfriend. Super irresponsible on my part. 

So what do I do? I don't tell my parents who support me a little for college Financials, but it's mostly paid for by aid, instead I have been keeping it secret. I said that I am taking a break and they did not know I got dismissed, I still have fees, and I have credit cards maxed.

Now I work as a cook and make terrible pay, bad hours, and it's not what I want to do. I used to like working on computers but now I feel like I don't like anything. I can't make any payments and I'm struggling just to have a vehicle to make it to work. I pay my parents monthly for insurance and the car which we bought from Craigslist. 

I just don't see a point to life anymore. I don't like how all life is relying on money and the likes, I just want to live a peaceful existence I guess and my mind doesn't want to try anymore. I have cut back on toking, a few times a week. But my mind really never feels clear. I've always had really poor short term memory and attention. The weed maybe affects it? I don't think it's very significant. I am scared to go to a doctor because I don't know what I would tell him. Maybe it's anxiety from my situation, or maybe it's some sort of depression or attention issue that has been surfacing? I  just looking for some answers I guess and some audience. Thanks for reading anyone

P. S. If there was a way for me to move to a new country and start a new, I think I'd like that. No startup money unfortunately but I really I've always had this passion for IT that I don't think will go away ",19Jan2017,3
