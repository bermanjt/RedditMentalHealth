0,"This will be a vent, so expect some rambling.
I live in a house with three other siblings and my parents. I am a very special person in that house. I am the only one who doesn't believe in the brainwashing my mom's done.
She believes crazy things. Here's just a little list of them:
The clouds are being controlled and airplanes spray down weird stuff
The world is run by lizard people
She can hear and see children being abused and it's the government because of MK-Ultra and split personalities (google it)
Everyone is being brainwashed
Not complete but that should give you an idea. She left work for a few years because she was anxious and now she is not okay. She sees children being raped for fucks sake! She accused people of fucking children in my family and distributing child porn. She says she sees movies in the clouds and air. She also sees abused children (sometimes her own) in the air.
So my mom basically brainwashed all of my siblings to believe her and now they're all wearing tinfoil hats in the corner of the room.
I said one day that I didn't believed it, and guess what she did? She kicked me out of the damn house and I had to move across the city to my biological dad's for half a year (I have a stepfather)
Speaking of father, my stepdad's life was ruined. My mom went on a hate campaign blaming him for doing horrible things to children, at the time (this was before I moved to my dad's) I didn't know what to do so I had to follow along. I had to ruin his life or mine would have been ruined. My Mom said that she would go in a car and yell at me down the road as I walked away if I dared do anything bad.
So about three months ago I started experiencing hallucinations and feelings that were spot-on to Psychosis (I understand I can't diagnose myself, okay?) and decided I needed help. I explained to my mom that I needed help and she just said that it was the clouds or something. She said that therapists brainwash you and treat you horribly (we saw a bad therapist, and assumed that all of them were?! I don't know). So now my (maybe) psychosis was getting worse and I couldn't get help.
I'm stuck because if I left for two hours and never told her what happened she would blame me for child porn, that's what she did with my step-dad.
I know I need help, but she also needs help. I need to bring her to someone, but she'd just plug her ears andgo ""lalalalala"". I'm so fucking frustrated beyond belief.
A lot for a 12-14 year old to go through, huh?",22Feb2017,1
1,"So I'm a 17 y/o male, so this might be a hormonal thing. But honestly all my life, I couldn't decide if I was happy or sad. Like literally a few months ago I was on cloud 9, I was so confident I thought I could take on the world (in other words, I volunteered for two production companies simultaneously during exam months which was kind of stupid in hindsight).

But for the past week, I just feel so down about everything. I'm insecure again, overeating, etc. Honestly nothing in my life has changed, why do I feel this way?

So is this just like normal teenage behaviour? Should I be taking anti-depressants?",22Feb2017,4
2,"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/brain-imaging-identifies-different-types-of-depression/#


&gt;The researchers used a noninvasive technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the strength of connections between neural circuits in the brain. Analyzing fMRI scans from more than 1,000 people, of whom about 40 percent had been diagnosed as depressive, the team identified four subtypes of depression. If confirmed in additional studies, the findings could enable clearer diagnoses and pave the way for personalized therapies targeting brain networks found to be awry in individual patients. 

One thing mental health practices don't have that other fields do is objective data. Psychiatric disorders are all diagnosed based on symptoms. Other issues not relating to the brain tend to be found via lab work, which gives a much clearer picture to the doctor of what the issue might be. 

This article kind of gives us a way to diagnose patients a bit more accurately, so we won't be wasting time on medications that will likely fail on just months. 

In my case l, Lexapro was good for about 6 months until it stopped being effective, switched to zoloft to see how that works out. 

One subtype is three times more likely to have a successful Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation treatment. That's one example of the benefit of knowing sub types. 

One downside for this news, up to 5 year wait :/.

3,"Who here has psychosis? And for those who've experienced it did you guys know you were going psychotic or feel like it? Or did it just randomly snap or slide through? Like you went awhile until it finally hit you, but eventually did. Cause I've been having anxiety and panic attacks coupled with feelings of depersonalization after an adderall binge where I THOUGHT I was going psychotic(guess I didn't btw according to others and some medical professionals) but I keep feeling like I'm gonna go psychotic or something. 

I can't tell if it's anxiety or it's gonna happen. I don't hear shit. Ive only had auditory hallucinations like twice and both times have been couple with days of getting/functioning on 2-3 hours of sleep a night. Like earlier, my friend said he was gonna come To my house and I thought i heard him Come in and say some shit but I go near the door and he wasn't there? Freaked me out for a sec. I do freak out over seeing shit, thinking I might be hallucinating, but realizing I'm not hallucinating at all. I'll get tense thinking I'll hallucinate but don't. 

I have experienced feelings of ""mania"" however from lack of sleep where I'll feel I have more confidence but according to others I still am in tact with reality, so I don't know. Don't really get paranoid either. Like I'll get some paranoid thoughts, but it's usually from lack of sleep and being on edge. If it helps any, I've been in constant stress for months now due to starting school again, getting fired from my job(fired me over having the fucking stomach flu), and exacerbated from drugs. I haven't been doing adderall since and hell, I haven't even really been smoking weed either. 

My problem is, I haven't had the urge to sleep much in a long ass time. And with this consistent lack of sleep, I'll start to be suspicious of others and shit. It's not overwhelming. I keep thinking I'm gonna have these crazy ass thoughts or something and I don't. Maybe grandiose thoughts but I've never taken them seriously. 

I don't know. Can anybody give me a clue about what the fuck is going on? Am I going psychotic or am I bipolar or something? Or simply stressed tf out and psyching myself out? 

I'm sure it doesn't help at all when I research shit about these conditions and find some apply to my life. With prodrome to psychosis, etc but it could be stress. It's just realizing I've been going through some highs and lows sporadically recently has me fucking worried. I know depersonalization can be a sign of the onset of psychosis, but it could also just be from panic and anxiety. So I don't fucking know. Can anybody help me? ",22Feb2017,2
4,"Say I'm watching my favorite youtubers. Sometimes crazy thoughts will come into my mind like, 'what if this off the wall talking is scripted? What if this is a scam? What if they are all AI? What if they don't exist?'

Then I try to justify it by thinking, they have live shows with thousands of attendees. 
Then I get the crazy thought, 'what if they're all robots, or holograms?'

The thought comes and sticks. Sometimes they trick me into believing them, when deep down inside I know they're lies.

I don't want to live like this. Someone please... help.",22Feb2017,1
5,A therapist told me once that she think I don't have ADD but a processing issue. I have very high IQ and have a few advanced degrees but I've done so many different things that my career has no direction.,22Feb2017,1
9,"10 minutes ago, I admitted something in front of another person.
something I hadn't even admitted to myself in my own head yet.
and I did an awful job of it.
I couldn't even join a few words and utter a sentence that actually made sense. 
All I did was spit out a few rusty phrases. I said what I could in that moment, that moment that felt like a head rush, like an emotional seizure, like a rainstorm in drought. Occasionally a tear would roll into my mouth and I would taste it on my tongue and once again realise that this moment was infact, real.
Anxiety.
Thats what I decided to call it. I said it was ""my anxiety"".
I don't remember how it went. But I can give you a version of it. A version of it that isn't in a state of outburst or panic.

 ""My anxiety came back"" I said, as if I was talking about an old friend. 
When it acts up, everything becomes meaningless and hopeless. I don't want people, I don't want myself. Suddenly everything that has ever gone wrong comes back to me and I blame myself for it all. I don't feel like I should talk to you or anyone else because I don't want to burden anyone with my problems, my problems, MY PROBLEMS WITH MYSELF, my problems, that aren't even real. I overthink. I overthink. Till it gives me a headache. I cant ask for help. I cant even help myself. Because its me who is doing this to my head in the first place. And then, and then you run away.
You're not there. You, You remember?"" I said, barely talking now. Just crying. 
""When I told you? that when you're there, Everything slows down for a second, There is no overthinking. For a moment, whatever is worrying me shuts up. Whatever is telling me I don't deserve anything because I suck, shuts up.""

And like an infant, I cry.Suddenly I didn't regret saying all of this out loud anymore. Suddenly I felt like it was okay. Like maybe it was fine, saying things, about my problems, was okay. Maybe the people who care do want to listen. Listen.

And then,
somebody knocks on the door. It must be Jen, I think.
I wake up from my comforting numbness as the envelope disappears with a sudden jerk. 
She gets up. I ask for my blanket to cover the mess that was my hair and face. Like a ruined village after a storm. 
The door opens and someone switches on the lights. 
I hear laughter. 
I hear them talk. 
They walk in. 
Sit on the opposite bed, as she opens up a bag of food and they revel in idle banter.
As Jen asks me ""are you okay?"" 
I say, as always, as Ive been all my life, 
""Im fine re, just tired I guess.""

10,"I'm an 18 y/o female and I've been struggling with anxiety and panic attacks. Long story short, I had my first ever panic attack in February last year and the past year has been kind of awful. I can probably count on one hand the number of times I've left my house since March or April. OCD also runs in my family (nearly everyone on my mom's side of the family has some form of it) and I'm almost certain that I have it. I've always had some symptoms of it, but it's gotten really bad over the past year and is a big factor in me not leaving the house.

So.. I don't know what to do. I panic whenever I leave the house, and can barely speak or function at all until I'm back home. But I'm just overwhelmed and exhausted and I want my life back. I really want to be able to talk to someone in person.. not on the phone or online, but I don't know how that would happen at this point. What can I do?",22Feb2017,1

I worry that he will leave me so I keep asking for reassurance. I fight with him, get mad at him and get really impatient. I do all those things and they put a strain in the relationship. And Then i worry about that. It's a vicious cycle. 

I worry that when he doesn't text me back when he's supposed to be home around the time he got into a car accident or something. I worry when he drives I worry when other people drive around him. I can't stop worrying. I worry about exams, worry about friends talking behind my back. 

Honestly I was never like this before. I've started to notice this this past 6 months. I'm lost and hopeless and depressed. Sometimes I feel suicidal too so I don't have to deal with this and he doesn't have to deal with me. I plan to speak to a doctor tomorrow hopefully to get prescription on antidepressants......

22,"A few days ago I started to feel bored. This is how it all started. I told myself it wasn't something serious and I tried to ignore it. The day after that, I woke up DROWNING in anxiety, I felt numb I didn't have any motivation to get out of bed, I had really bad stomach burns and I constantly have this ""lump"" feeling in my throat. Today was even worse...I suddenly started to feel distant from my boyfriend (yes, we've been over the honeymoon phase for a long time, but I've never felt so disconnected from him and it's what bothers me the most). I just feel like I don't know him anymore, it doesn't feel like I am talking to him, and I am always tense when we're talking. I feel distant from everyone, and it's so scary because it feels like I'm someone else, it feels unreal, I want the old me back. What is happening to me? I had a similar phase back in april last year and it was nightmare. I don't remember how I got out of it, but it took me a few months. I don't care about how I feel, I just want things to be ok between me and my boyfriend. But I feel like I've lost my memory and connection with him, I can't remember any memories with him, and it literally feels like I suddenly forgot everything about him and myself. I can't remember what feelings I had for him yesterday, all I know is, everything was okay.

EDIT: also, I suddenly remember things from my childhood. They're just sudden flashbacks, but they're so disturbing. It's the first time when I get this kind of flashbacks.

28,"I understand the lecture about boundaries.  I've gotten it from every therapist I've seen.  My question is what do you do when boundaries aren't a good option?  I've been in several situations where:

(1) The other individual was someone who wasn't going to accept boundaries voluntarily.

(2) I had little to no power to do anything to the other person that would be a reasonable reaction or consequence that would affect them.

(3) Removing myself from the situation would have been a very high-cost move to me (e.g. dropping out of a college or having to sue to break a lease).

In these situations, it's not that I didn't know what boundaries were or how to set them, it's that I didn't have any power to set boundaries without causing significant disruption to my life and little to no effect on the other person.  So how do you cope in those situations if the cost of setting boundaries is as high or higher than the cost of putting up with someone who is unsafe?

32,"Unfortunately I'm not with her right now, our mother is, so I'm getting a lot of second-hand information, but this is what I know as of right now:

We live in Pennsylvania, US.  My sister lives in Philadelphia.  She's 17 and is living in apartments across from the school she's attending, without my mother ( who lives outside of DC but pays all my sisters bills and visits her weekly. )

Sunday night ( 2/19/17 ) sister made an apparent suicide attempt, what's apparently classified as an ""under dose"", basically a cry for attention.

Sister is telling my mom that she was on a chat room for suicide and the cops somehow found her through her IP and came and took her away to the hospital.  The nurses are saying ( presumably from my sister ) that she called herself in and was picked up in an ambulance.  Unsure which is true.

She was put under a 302 and transfered Monday to a Crisis center.  Things went swiftly downhill from there.
They woke her up in the middle of the night Monday Night / Tuesday morning to have her sign a 201, which they essentially lied to her to get her to sign, telling her it would let her leave.

They've been giving my mom and my sister conflicting information, telling my sister she can leave and my mom that she can't and my mom finally went in Tuesday afternoon to try to get a straight story and take her home.  They wouldn't let her leave, and they rescinded the 201 which apparently ( according to the attorney ) 'reset' the clock on the 302 that they put her back under.

They wouldn't allow my mother to speak to her lawyer in front of my sister or allow my sister to speak to her lawyer.

They've threatened to report the situation to DHS if my mom seeks legal action, saying that her living alone is a form of neglect.

Attorney says they shouldn't have a case with DHS, considering how frequently my mother visits and how old my sister is.

Attorney is apparently unable to intervene AT ALL until 48-72 hours on the 302 passes or they try to elevate the situation.

They're holding her under a 'serious' suicide attempt, despite it being an underdose.  They won't give her a room, she's in a common room with other children ranging from young to same-age, gets only a blanket and nothing else, is unable to even sleep unless my mother is there.  The facility is disgusting, they don't monitor the children or give them any form of mental stimulation.

It seems they're denying both of them basic rights and I'm just so confused and frustrated and I'm trying to do what I can.  We just want her out of this facility where she isn't getting help -- it seems like they're just waiting for her to legitimately snap and go crazy.  We just want her somewhere where they're going to genuinely give her help.  If anyone has any experience, advice, help to offer I would be so appreciative.

Now don't get me wrong, they're good parents, always providing for me materially, even saving up a large education fund, but I can't help but shake the notion that their parenting style caused my mental issues.

42,"tl;dr at the bottom - trying not to bias readers with my imperfect summation (and possibly imperfect reaction to her concerns)

So, I picked up my girlfriend at the airport. She suffers from self-diagnosed panic attacks.  She moved in recently and we have a room full of her stuff that is disorganized and we are in need of a desk, storage things, etc. These will come in time (due to schedules and money, of course), but while the mess exists it vexes her.

I ask her if we could set a specific timetable for figuring out what we're going to get and when, so that we can have concrete moving forward plans, so it will be less vexing to her. 

She comes up with a plan for us to go to Ikea the next day and take some pictures, to move plan forward. Great!

Next day comes, and work hits her with unexpected news. She has some things to accomplish by tomorrow AM that she had not planned on doing at this point. So her plan is to go to IKEA for a trip first to check things out, and then to head home and do her work for tomorrow.

Now, my concerns - she has a history of poor time management. She has a history of letting work pile up, to the detriment of her career. It is also unknown how long the work thing will take (her estimates are occasionally off).

My response is something to the effect of 'I think that's a bad idea, you should get the work stuff done first, because that HAS to be done by tomorrow. We can do Ikea another time.'

She replies that since the Ikea thing is now on her mind, if we DON'T do it now, it's going to make her panic, and so we have to do it now.

I really think it's a bad idea - that her work will take too long, that she's risking a poor night's sleep (which she already doesn't get nearly enough of), and that she'll be poorly rested for work, has to drive a long ways (and risk crashing the car), etc. So I tell her she can go if she wants, but I can't in good conscience take part in a decision that I think is a poor one for her work and health.

She starts blaming me, saying that it's my fault she's going to have a panic attack. I tell her 'Hey, you can still go and take the pictures and notes, I just can't participate because I think it's a bad idea. But I'll happily look at the things you bring home while you work, and we can go from there.' 

She panics. Blames me. Says that, until she can get her panic attacks under control, that the goal should be to go along with whatever she needs in order to avoid said panic attacks; otherwise, the attacks are my fault. I told her that I would of course soothe her as best I can when she panics, but that I can't be coerced into doing things I think are poor choices just because the result is that she will panic.

This feels a bit like emotional blackmail, but I realize I'm not a professional and perhaps I'm overreacting. Is it reasonable to subjugate my conscience and integrity to mitigate her panic? Looking for a little advice here; any would be fine, even if it's to tell me 'Just do whatever she needs'.


tl;dr - Am I obliged to acquiesce to a panic sufferers demands if they say 'If you don't do this I'm going to have a panic attack' ? It feels a bit like emotional blackmail (not a fan)",22Feb2017,2
