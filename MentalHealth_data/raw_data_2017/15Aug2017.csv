0,"So I'm an 18 year old male and I've been considering maybe seeing a therapist but am a bit apprehensive about doing so because my family doesn't have a lot of money and honestly this is something I really don't want to bring up with my parents, so I thought I'd ask you guys first to see if it would even be worth it. I honestly don't really know where to start. Well I guess I'll start with something that I've felt since I was young. 

Ever since I was little I've always had a hard time with my appearance. I remember a lot of the times I'd be with friends and see myself in the mirror I'd feel uglier than my friends, and felt like something was just off about my face. Then came the teenage years and I then began spending a lot more time thinking about my appearance. I was hyper sensitive to any criticism about my appearance, and a lot of the times I would be hurt by things that weren't even about my appearance. I remember one time I was in a store and a girl walked up to someone I was talking to and asked for his number. This crushed me and made me feel terribly ugly for the next few days just because she wasn't interested in me. I began to style my hair for a while so it would cover up my face. I would always have to check my face whenever I walked by a reflective surface. Whenever choosing a seat somewhere I'll always try and sit so the good side of my face is facing everyone else. Now I've been told nothing's wrong with my face, in fact I receive many compliments about my appearance but I can seem to shake this feeling that something wrong with it. It's gotten a little better now that I'm not a teenager, and though I'm a more confident now I still catch myself staring at my reflection quite a bit. My self esteem is still pretty low and I've never really had the confidence to talk to women, in fact I've already convinced myself that I'll die alone. For as well as having a lack of confidence, I'm also terribly awkward.

Which brings me to the next thing that concerns me, more shitty social skills. This is something that hasn't started to develop until my teenage years, and it's still as bad if not worse than then. I've always tried to treat people politely, and with respect, as if they were my superiors. Well now it's gotten to the point where's it not me being nice anymore, I actually feel inferior to everyone. This makes me feel like if I say one thing wrong to someone I don't know well they'll hate me. I feel like I have no room for error in social situations. Words used to flow out of me during conversation but now I find myself just sitting there awkwardly trying to piece together something to say. I feel as though I can't open up to anyone and if I do they'll just find out how weird I am and won't like me very much. A lot of the times lately I'll just avoid situations where I have to be with strangers. If my friends invite me to hangout with their friends I usually make up an excuse not to come in fear that their friends won't like me. I remember there was a few times where people would try to talk to me when I had earphones in and I would hear them but ignore them so I wouldn't have to talk. This happened once with a girl who I really liked though I wanted to talk to her and I just couldn't bring myself to, it just made me too anxious and I knew I'd fuck it up. I ended up just listening to my music pretending like I didn't hear her. A few days later I walked past her and I knew she was smiling at me when I walked by but I just pretended not to notice, afterwards I could hear her ask her friend why I was ignoring her. This made me suicidal for the next week as all I could think about was how bad I fucked up and how hopeless I've became. 

Holy smokes I just realized how long I just went on for, I guess I've just been holding this in for a while, I could go on but I won't. Anyways for those who stuck with me through this whole thing, should I see a therapist?

2,"I tried talking to my psychiatrist about a lot of the things that bother me but she said I'm probably just over thinking. I just don't get social cues and I don't know why. My mom always gets upset because I take things So literally or I tell people what they asked me but they expected me to sugarcoat it. I don't get it and it's pissing me off but my psychiatrist says I'm just overthinking but I just started to get invited out places again because in the past I realize that I didn't act the way that I was expected to in public. I thought it was normal but later I realized that the way I respond is different to other people. And now I'm just really upset and I don't understand why.

3,"I’ve been under a lot of stress lately.  More than I normally am, and, to be honest, more than a little of it is self imposed.

It’s starting to wear me down.

I’m becoming irritable, apathetic, depressed, and shut off, and I hate it.

I’ve always viewed stress as a problem, and most people who know me will tell you I’m a fixer.  I try and hold myself above the issues.  You have a problem.  I want to help you fix it.  I want to analyze it.  Break it down. Figure out what is really the issue at the core of the problem and change that.  

It’s who I am.  It’s how I face life and my philosophy on the world.  The world is made up of circumstances and outcomes, and knowing what to do is just a matter of knowing how to use the materials to find the solution.

“A” leads to “B” but can be altered by doing “C”.  Wash.  Rinse.  Repeat.

I’m in a difficult place right now.  Work is hard.  I’m basically a first year teacher again except with needier students and parents and I’m the team leader of my teachers.  I’m working longer hours under a more frustrating environment for the same amount of pay, which honestly wasn’t great to begin with.  Hooray for teacher’s salary.

Speaking of money, finances have been tight...like, really tight.  I can’t tell you the last time I took my wife out for dinner, or gave her a budget so she could go shopping with her family.  We work, we come home, we count our money at least once a week.  We eat what have in the house and watch Netflix and then fall asleep to do it all over again because that’s where our finances have been.  But somehow for months our bank account still seemed to be getting smaller each month until we finally stalled it this June.

I’m emasculated by it.  It makes me feel like I can’t provide for my family.  My wife is terrified to spend even a dollar because she knows how tight money is right now.  It’s costing her relationships with her friends and family.  Its damaged her self esteem. Its frustrating us to know end because we have not been on a vacation together in the three years we’ve been married.  

What type of husband am I when I can’t provide for the most important person in the world?

But all of these are circumstances.  

I can break these down.

Work is hard, so I set a routine.  Go in early so you don’t have to stay as late.  Make a lesson plan and a half a day so on days when your planning is filled with meetings and paperwork you still have a routine for tomorrow.  Establish clear but personal boundaries and expectations with the students and parents so they understand the order of the work day.  

“A” leads to “B” but can be altered by doing “C”.  Wash.  Rinse.  Repeat.

Money is tight.  At the start of the summer I acquired a second job.  I’m a freelance writer for a WordPress company.  They pay by the article.  I’ve not made as much headway into the company as I would have liked.  I blame that on one part frustration and three parts distraction by the other things going on in life.  If I can produce two articles a week then I have the potential to make an additional $200 a month.

“A” leads to “B” but can be altered by doing “C”.  Wash.  Rinse.  Repeat.

I’m emasculated.  I’ve been doing more work around the house.  I clean more.  I’m trying to fix things that have gone ignored for months if not years.  I’m trying to better educate myself.  I’m trying to pick myself up out of this pit I’m in.  I’m investing in myself.  I’m working desperately to establish habits so that when we hit the end of this tunnel we don’t slide back into it.  I’m going to define myself again.

“A” leads to “B” but can be altered by doing “C”.  Wash.  Rinse.  Repeat.

But like I said.  All of these are just circumstances.

I’m a fixer.

I analyze problems and break them down.  I look at what is at the core of the issue.  None of these things are the core.

I have a good job.  Yes it's hard but it is full of good people who care about me and want me to succeed.  I’m honestly blessed I’m there instead of somewhere else.

I don’t make the amount of money I want, but I make enough.  We’ve never gone hungry.  We’ve never been unable to pay our bills.  On a teacher’s salary we still manage to travel to Africa every year to visit missionary friends of ours.  We are capable of surviving on my salary alone.

I have an identity.  I have a definition of myself.  I am curious.  I am a planner.  I am dependable as I can be.  I am a hard worker.  I keep my word to the best of my ability.  I struggle with doubt.  I am stubborn.  I do not quit.  And I am ignorant to so much of the world.

Though I may feel emasculated, I have an understanding of who I am and what I need to personally work on.

What’s the issue?

I’m not happy.

I’ve been trying to find and fix my stress level for a very long time.  I’ve been trying to analyze myself for months through the ups and downs of my moods, but what I finally came to was asking myself a simple question.  Are you happy?  And to be honest with you I didn’t want to be honest with myself.  I want to put my shields up.  Keep your gloves in front of you.  Don’t let it show that you’re down, but if I want to fix it I have to face it.  

I’m not happy.

Before I really start to worry you let me say I’m not unhappy.  To best explain how I feel I guess I need to direct you towards The Oatmeal’s comic strip titled “How to be perfectly unhappy”.  In this panel he explains that Happiness is not a binary measure.  People are not unhappy just because they are not happy, and happiness should not be an ultimate life goal.  That once you achieve happiness you will be perfectly maintained for the rest of your life is an unrealistic ideal.  

The Oatmeal goes on to say he may not consider himself happy, but he does consider himself interested in things.  Driven towards things.  Motivated to do things because he has a belief that they are for the good of him, meaningful, and compelling.  He wants to create and to destroy and explore the intricacies of everything.  He wants to experience and enjoy the journey of being interested.  I would argue that that might not be the common definition of “happy”, but it’s a pretty fantastic one.

I don’t have that.

That’s what I mean when I say I find myself not happy.  I can’t find my interested.  I don’t know what I find meaningful for myself.  I can’t remember the last time I found something compelling.  When was the last time I let myself experience?  I don’t know when I last felt like I was moving towards fulfilled.

The good news is that I think I’ve figured out the core of the problem.  

At least there’s that.

4,"My psychiatrist recommended that I give group therapy a try and put me in one centered around mindfulness. In the beginning, things went pretty well other than my anxiety about being in a group setting. The more I seem to practice mindfulness at home the better I felt. I do suffer from bipolar disorder and around week 10 I experienced a severe depressive episode. They say mindfulness is supposed to help with this but in that state, it seemed to make things worse. After all, mindfulness is about living in the moment and do you really want to do that when you depressed? I also found that when I would do the guided meditation a few memories that I had repressed came back and they were difficult to deal with. I was wondering if anyone was willing to share any thoughts about mindfulness since it seems to be the current medical rage even though you don't need special licensing to teach it.",15Aug2017,6,

I've always been kind of an insomniac but I recently managed to get into a routine where I'm going to bed at a reasonable time and I'm falling asleep fairly quickly. I'm really pissed off that something is messing it up like this.

I've started experiencing this ""thing"" where I'm feeling forced awake well before my alarm. It feels like sleep is literally being pulled away from me and I often wake up kicking, pulling my clothes, tangling myself up in my bedding etc. I can only describe it as it feeling like someone is reaching into my head and and physically dragging sleep out of my brain. Sometimes I can fall back asleep after about 20 minutes but just now I've woken up with a bad headache and I feel pretty damn awake. I've also been experiencing some really vivid, wacky as hell dreams.

I'm really starting to get scared by this. I would like to consult a doctor about it but trying to get an appointment right now is a real pain.

11,"So, I'm just going to try and keep everything anonymous as possible. Sorry if my grammar sucks, English is my second language. I started working at this restaurant, and I didn't know but two of the guys that have the highest seniority in the restaurant were my brother's friends. Rewind couple years back, my brother had a group of friends going, but they all turned their backs on him with no apparent reason (even if my brother confronted them about it, they refused to answer and completely cut him off). I was guessing it was because my brother was always the ""center point"" of the friends group, untill this other guy showed up and everything changed his friend circle. So now I have to deal with seeing these past friends of my brother, who my brother despises the most for giving him the silent treatment. What do I do when it comes to working? My workplace is a highend restaurant and since it is an asian chain store, seniority is extremely effective. I feel so ashamed to work, because it feels like they are picking on me the most. And I'm sure they know about what happened in the past with my brother and them. They used to come over to my house when I was younger and sort of played along for me when I was a kid. Now I feel like all this thinking is gonna mess with my head during work.

14,"I've struggled with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. That being said the last time I had a really low period was 3 years ago, but I somehow managed to pull myself out of it and get back on my feet. It wasn't easy though and it took probably 1-2 years to feel as close to my normal self as possible. 

Unfortunately a bunch of life stresses at once have sent me plunging back into the depths of anxiety and depression. I had a bunch of stuff going on in my personal life, then I got sick (and being physically unwell is a massive trigger for me), and it just kind of snowballed until I found myself in the midst of pure panic. 

The symptom I'm struggling with most though is a total loss of appetite paired with constant hunger pain and nausea. I can't even put a piece of food in my mouth without gagging. I've been drinking smoothies to get some nutrients into my body but they can only do so much. Even if I get myself to a good place in the evening, I wake up the next day with the same stomach ache which just sets off my anxiety again, creating a vicious cycle. 

If, for example, I didn't have a job or I worked from home, I'd probably be able to calm down and focus on slowly getting myself back to normal. But I have this overhanging dread of having to go to work in an office while I'm feeling like this. Yesterday I had to leave work early because I just couldn't handle it. I love my job and I haven't been there long (barely 6 months) and I just don't want to fuck it up because of the anxiety. I have depression too which really rubs salt in the wounds and makes me feel even worse.

For context I take 10mg of citalopram daily (my dose was originally 20mg but it was giving me horrific stomach cramps so I had to go down to 10). I also take diazepam when I'm really bad but it pretty much knocks me out so isn't something I can do during work hours. 

Any advice would be really appreciated. I'm putting a lot of pressure on myself to get better which I know is only going to make it worse and I have been having some suicidal thoughts because I can't stand being back in such a bad place mentally. I just want to get back to normal :(  ",15Aug2017,3,

I am worried that there will be nobody to save me if I decide to commit something-we-are-not-allowed-to-talk-about. 
So, fellas, is it okay or is it not okay? I mean, for me it's kinda weird to share basically my MIND with other people, who I don't even know because it is Internet. Maybe I am just overthinking stuff again?

I think I might have some form of add but I'm not sure.

20,"Hi guys, I am a 21 year old female. I have searched desperately online to find out why I am the way I am. Since a few years ago, my anger has really become a problem for me. As a child, I was EXTREMELY quiet and shy. I was the girl in class that you would forget was even there because of how quiet and antisocial I was. I was really shy, but I was a very nice and calm person. At one point i could really say that I was the sweetest person I knew. When I turned 16, I started working retail to help break me out of my shell. This is when I started becoming more comfortable with myself, and in speaking my mind. I was the girl that never got any attention, and then at age 16-18, i started making so many friends and got so much attention from guys. It was all the wrong types of attention, but at the time, I just didnt care. I got played, and treated liek trash by stupid guys, until I broke my pattern of being with fuckups, and decided to be by myself. My anger issues were starting to begin around this time. I would go off on any guy that treated me wrongly. I felt like I had been so nice for so long, and everyone would step all over my because they knew how nice I was, and that I wouldnt say anything. This applied to guys, and girls. That was the start of my anger. Then I took a break from guys to focus on myself, and my wellbeing. At age 18, i got with my now bf who was 22 at the time. In the start, my anger was not a problem. We had an amazing relationship. As time progressed, my anger bubbled up in the worst forms. I would get mad at little things, and hold grudges for hours. I felt he didnt try hard enough to make me feel better. These little anger fits got worse and worse. Now when we fight, my anger has become so intense that it feels like an episode. I get these waves of anger, my heart starts beating so intensely, my whole body heats up, and I am in a state of ANGER. I cant explain it, I just want to cuss out and say the meanest most personal shit to make him angry and hurt the way I feel. I even scratch him. It honestly feels like a fit of rage; an episode. It ends as soon as it starts. I scream, yell, say mean shit, and then when I feel the anger and heat all leave my body, I want to continue on my day with him like nothing even happened. In fact, I get mad at him for even dwelling on my rage. WHich is totally fucking crazy, i know! BUt I genuinely feel like i have a problem, and I dont know what it is. I have looked into so many mental disorders, but I just dont feel like I fit any of them. When I think about going to see a professional, I just get scared.

Zoloft is having *some* kind of effect. I've noticed the libido side-effects, for instance. After three weeks, I'm much more irritable, feel more depressed than I was before I started taking the stuff. 

I had a similar reaction to Paxil a number of years ago. But that time it was suicidal ideations after a few weeks on the drug. So I stopped.

26,"Ok, so something weird happened to my body the other day and I just don't know what it was. I'll try to tell you what I experienced. I apologize for the not-perfect English and the long text but here it comes:

I don't feel very well about myself, have never done either. Recently I've been very stressed about my studies since I failed a big course at my university, neither do I know what I want to do in the future and that's very stressful to me. Right now I'm doing a minor course which has taken about 5 weeks still I'm all exhausted and the exam is in two days. To add I'm not prepared at all.

Two days ago I moved back from my hometown to the town where I study, and none of my friends are here yet. When I was studying I couldn't seem to find the exact formula I was looking for on my paper which made me feel like I was outside my body and about to freak out. I had to calm myself down by just breathing and then I found it. Recently these pop-up windows on my computer has been bothering me every other minute and that is extremely annoying and I didn't know how to solve the problem. Anyhow that's a small issue but big for me apparently since I started feeling panic spreading through my body(I was in bed at this moment with the computer on my stomach). It was like I couldn't control what was going to happen next. My legs started numbing and I had a pressuring feeling on my chest, a bit hard to breathe. This feeling never went away and I fell asleep after a while. 

When I started studying the next morning I had an ache on my left shoulder, right next to my neck. It got worse after a while and my neck started almost cramping and aching as well. The whole day I could feel small different parts of my body numbing/getting small spasms.

Is this a physical symptom of stress or what is really going on?

27,"What is usually a doctor's logic on increasing the dosage on anti-depressants? If a person is put on anti-depressants and after several months it feels like they've been suffering from nothing but bad side effects i've seen doctors opt to increase the dosage rather than begin to ween the patient off of it. Are they basically following the logic of pushing through the person's side effects and getting to the positive results of the medicine or is it something else?

To give some context to this question, my girlfriend was placed on anti-depressants several years ago (50mg of fluoxetine). At the time she seemed to suffer nothing but negative side effects. When she reported this to the doctor their response was to increase it to 100mg. This seems to have no effect either and the negative side effects continued. When this happened again they made the decision to up again. My girlfriend's response was to quit the medicine and just ween herself off it (possibly not the best idea but she was scared). This eventually got rid of the side effects but the depression continued. Now a year later she's gone back to being on setraline and she's suffering similar negative effects (with the added bonus of extra anxiety). She's due to go back to the doctor to report this since it's continued for two months now but she's scared that they'll just increase the dosage resulting in the same situation as last time.

While i get that SSRI's are more a 'it just works' type drug is there a strong line of logic towards the doctor's increasing the dosage (as opposed to continuing the same/reducing/stopping the dosage)?",15Aug2017,1,

29,"So yesterday at the gym a really really weird feeling came over me.  I was on the treadmill watching ESPN on the treadmill TV through my headphones.  While running I'm looking up at one of the many TVs on the wall and some random music video clip comes on one of them.  All of sudden I experience an INTENSE feeling of DejaVu, I also noticed I got really light headed and hot, and for a few seconds felts this weird buzzing in my head.  The feeling of DejaVu was accompanied by this intense thought in my head of ""What the sound on the video clip would sound like"", my brain just started playing this song that apparently it associated with the video clip I was staring at.  This is all while Stephen A Smith or whomever is screaming at me from ESPN, but in my mind I just hear this song that apparently should be synced up with the video I'm looking at.  I felt super light headed, and decided to end my workout.  Since that moment basically it now seems like EVERY single thought I have brings on this intense feeling of DejaVu, like I've already had that exact train of thought or a lucid dream about that train of thought very recently if that makes any sense.  I realize this might sound kinda crazy, but I looked up some stuff on my own, and found several articles with people discussing similar symptoms.  Some of them are much better described than I can, so I wanted to paste the links here if that helps people understand what I'm going through, b/c these people describe it wayyy better than I can:

https://forums.netdoctor.co.uk/discussion/46920/weird-and-frightening-de-ja-vu-feelings

Most of the descriptions in here are spot on, and I'm kinda freaking out a little bit.  This incident came totally out of nowhere, I've never had anything like this occur before.  All last night I was having insanely weird trains of thought where everything I was thinking about, I instantly felt like I just had an intense lucid dream about that train of thought, but had just woken up from it, so therefore couldn't really piece together the exact sequence of thoughts etc.  I had to reset my reddit pw last night, and just doing that felt like something I had very recently had an intense dream/memory about, its so fucking weird.

Basically every little bit of stimulus hitting my brain, from something I look up online, to what's on the TV, to random thoughts I'm having are triggering these super intense feelings of DejaVu and I can't shake it.  Some examples would be when I got home yesterday was watching some Vice News special about the Charlottesville rally and every scene they were showing I felt like I had been there, had seen all these sights before up close...granted some of the footage they were showing was stuff I'd been seeing on the news all week, but I literally was feeling like I had just been on all of the streets that they were showing.  Then the incident with my reddit PW, etc, again can't describe it as anything other than having intense feelings of memory and dejaVu from stimulus that realistically I have never experienced before and therefore should not be causing DejaVu if that makes sense.

This came totally out of nowhere yesterday during a very routine workout, so really not sure what the cause of it is.  I know this is a pretty random, rambling and incoherent post but if anyone is familiar with what I'm dealing with and can provide some insight that would be rad....

32,"I've seen a lot of random posts online about gaslighting but my question is, is it gaslighting to point out mental health problems if they really are there?  How do you deal with someone that refuses to see that they have a problem?

Storytime:
I met a girl online.  I lived in NYC and she lived in NJ.  We dated for about 4 months until things started deteriorating at work, and I realized I would likely have to move out of state in order to have any potential upward mobility.  We broke up but remained friends.  I got an amazing job offer in another state. I moved out of state, we continued to talk, and I got stable in my new job and state.  After a while, we both then realized we both wanted to try and make the relationship work.  Her job was a dead end, and she was looking to move out of her home state and possibly live with friends or relatives across the country, and she suggested that she wouldn't mind moving to where I was and give it a try, if it doesn't work out she'll continue with her plans to move with her friends and family on the west coast.   I really like her and we have a nice connection so I agree, she finds a job nearby, quits her job in NJ, and moves down and moves in with me. 

After about a month or two a ton of things from her past start bubbling up. Over the next few months, I find that her father was abusive, the mother didn't intervene. From what I can piece together, her defense to the abuse was to get angry and act out.  Her parents tried to put her on medication and found some psychiatrist to prescribe her an adult dose of Sarafem which makes her go crazy. Her parents basically drop her in an orphanage/group home because they can't deal with her.  She has a bunch of societal issues in the home, body image issues become anorexic, acts out, becomes angry.  At some point, she gets out of the home somehow, and moves back in with her family, but becomes an alcoholic, and starts abusing prescription drugs, hangs out with bad people, bad friends, abusive and manipulative guys and friends that are just horrible to her.  

Fast forward a few years, she's better, gets her life together to a large extent, stops drinking, quits drugs, cuts a lot of bad people out of her life.  She still struggles with anger and body image issues.  Gets some plastic surgery, goes into debt to do so. Begins taking opposite OTC and perscription drugs to balance anxiety.  Finds a doctor to prescribe a random drug that supposedly helps with anxiety, but she has issues sleeping so takes sleeping pills every night. 

She has had a bunch of therapy but says it doesn't work.  At least one therapist brought up that she may have borderline personality disorder. She is extremely quick to anger, massively sensitive, and tends to be quick to take things to the extreme. Very quickly goes to ""we should just break up"".  She legitimately hears the absolute worst in any sentence when she is in an anxious mood and doesn't recognize when she's being angry, accusatory or yelling.  Any doubt or insecurity that I have immediately gets taken as not being happy with her and ends up being me reassuring her for 30 min, and I never can never just talk to her about how I feel at all because it turns into a fight.  

Anything that makes her feel like she is not the best, is reacted with anger.  I've tried to bring up that some of this stuff is not normal, especially the body image issues as she wants more plastic surgery and thinks she is ugly. I've tried to tell her that she should seek help and that it's not normal for us to fight like this.  And she gets defensive, and starts yelling ""it's not just me!"".  

And to her credit, for the first 8months or so, when she would come at me with anger, I would try to remain calm but struggled with it and would often respond with anger.  In the past 8 months, I have put a lockdown on my anger, and will not respond with anger.  If I feel myself getting angry, I get up and say we need to take a break from talking, when you calm down, we can talk again and try to leave the room.  

Since then, I've tried to push for her to get help and tell her that she needs to deal with her past.  She often takes that offensively and aggressively saying that she has dealt with it and that therapy doesn't help.  She finally agreed to see a couples counselor, and I figured that the therapist would see that she needs some help dealing with her past, but the therapist didn't really say anything and it cost 200 dollars an hour to go.  She just listened to us argue for 55 min and charged me 200 dollars.  

She is massively hesitant to see that this is affecting our relationship, and I'm not saying that I don't have my issues.  But my argument with her has been, how can we figure out the things that I need to work on if your past causes you to react with so much anger and to hear the worst in any situation and take everything so personally. 

I have brought up several times that I don't blame her, and that I blame her parents, and that it's not her fault it's just that she had a really rough childhood, and she's handled it really well compared to most people, but she doesn't need to suffer and continue to have issues, and that she should seek help.  When she's in a non-defensive state she sometimes agrees to it, but when she's defensive, she does not see anything she is doing wrong,  everything is the worst, we should just break up, I'm so insensitive, she is so good to me.  

I really thought the therapist would help, but I've lost hope on that since we went a few times.  She is resistant to go alone as she doesn't think she has a problem and gets angry if I point out the things that she does, and how she acts angry, or aggressive.  

I'm at the point that I don't really know what to do.  I truely want to her to get help, but she takes that as that there is something wrong with her despite any reassureance that I give her.  Anyone have any experience dealing with this?  Suggestions or thoughts would be appreciated. 

TLDR: Date a girl that had a horrible past, abusive parents, abandonment etc.  Problems still affect her, and she goes fast to anger and every little thing becomes a fight.  Anytime I try to push that she needs to try and get help, I'm wrong for saying so.  Any thoughts or comments would be appreciated.   ",15Aug2017,2,
33,"So I started a new job this past week and I've been having trouble with a few mental health issues. I just feel like even tho I'm really excited to work that I am very unmotivated. Another thing is is that I have moderately severe social anxiety so trying to interact with people at work is going to be hard. I already feel awkward about it all and scared to do the simplest of tasks and I just finished orientation. Does anybody have any suggestions for me on how I should tackle this? I've been going to therapy but I fear that with the hours I work that I'm not able to see my therapist as much. I tried talking to a close friend about these issues but they don't seem to care or to make time for me. Idk, I'm just trying to get though this in one piece.",15Aug2017,1,

36,"Today I want to talk about depression and mental health. I have been suffering from depression for a good few years now. The kind of culture I belong to depression has never been given enough importance. In Pakistani culture, unless you behave or look different from others you are not considered to have any mental health issues. Only a tiny fraction of the society understands the dynamics of mental disorder, rest of the population is absolutely ignorant about issues related to depression and mental health. 

Back home in Pakistan, people living in the rural areas, who are not educated still rely upon ancient superstitions and take patients suffering from depression and mental disorder to Sufi shrines. Poor people with no money no access to Healthcare and no understanding of the disorder rely upon prayers. If you Google how mental health issues are treated in Pakistan’s rural areas your heart will break by looking at the stories of people being chained like animals and people getting devil beaten out of them by religious/faith healers. 

The second point I want to make is the mental health issues in the LGBT community from Muslim or Asian background. The acceptance and tolerance for LGBT people among religious and traditional families is very limited. This forces people like me to stay in the closet and do not embrace their true authentic self. Some end up living a false life and just conform to what is expected from them by their family, religion and culture. Some end up leading double lives one for the world and a secret life for themselves, behind their families’ and their spouses’ back. And those very few who dare to come out face violence, ostracization, alienation, and getting disowned by their families. This level of low acceptance and tolerance leads to even higher levels of depression and mental health issues in LGBT people from traditional and religious communities.

Naz and Matt Foundation, NAZ and Imaan are some of the organisations in London I am aware of who are providing a fantastic support network for LGBT people from all back grounds and especially for people from Asian and religious backgrounds.  I myself have used their services and found them to be very helpful.  I have found support groups to be more helpful than just getting treatment in a clinical environment.

38,"Hello!

I'm a 27 year old man and I'm posting my story here hoping there is someone who is able to help me. I'm currently under treatment but until now I've only had an intake interview. In about 3 weeks I'm going to have some tests to be able to diagnose. English is not my native language so I apologize in advance for mistakes.

I think it's best if I explain my situation from the beginning. I've had a normal childhood, without any real problems or trauma's. I was one of the 'popular', but underneath I always was kind of insecure. The insecurity become much worse in high school.

I've always had some problems in my life, but I always tried my best to fix these. When I was 25 I had my first real relationship. The first months were amazing, I really was infatuated and I enjoyed life a lot. But after a couple of months that feeling subsided and I felt empty. The emptiness continued and I realized my emotions always have been very flat.

My relationship began deteriorating. I knew my relationship was one of the very few things that gave me positive feelings so I really wanted to 'fix' my situation. I've began researching on the internet and talked with people around me. I've really questioned a lot of thoughts and behaviours of mine. I've considered a lot of things: autism, Aspergers, depression, anhedonia, personality disorders, etcetera but I score very low on tests for those.

The 'symptoms' I experience are all emotional. As told my emotions are very limited, I rarely experience strong emotions and when I do it's mostly with music or movies. I've learned I don't experience affective empathy although my cognitive empathy is very good. I'm not able to form attachments to anyone, let it be family or romantic interests. I've spoken about this with some people and nobody seems to notice these things and they all think I overthink this situation. But since I've learned I miss those things, I know I'm missing out on life a lot! Before I knew these things, I've never been really happy in my life, besides the first months of the relationship. But the relationship was doomed to fail because of my problems.

I will list as many symptoms as possible since I think this may be valuable in creating the big picture:
- Low libido, I've never really had a drive for a relationship. I've been horny of course, but not as much as a healthy young man should be;
- Flat affect, don't experience emotions strongly. Very limited range of emotions. Do experience emotions way stronger with music or movies (alexithymia?);
- Unable to attach to people, don't really build a history with people;
- Often experience bodily tensions (tense feeling chest, tense muscles, jaw clenching, sweating);
- Aphantasia: unable to form images in my mind. I rarely have visions when I'm about to fall asleep, but they are not vivid;
- Never really 100% comfortable in social situations, even with family;
- Very little motivation. I don't really have a drive to do things. I've completed my study because I've felt I should not because I wanted to. I don't really WANT to do something. It's always: 'mmm, it's better than nothing'. When I take a look at my brother of 3 years younger, he really is excited to go out, to live on his own, to have sex, to go to festivals etc. I really miss that drive.
- Slight ear ringing;
- Difficulties concentrating.

Because of all of this, I really am wondering why I should live any longer? Nothing really matters. My life has no real purpose if you can't experience positive emotions. The only positive thing in my life is trying to fix my situation. I've tried a lot of things, supplements, diets, drugs etc. but nothing worked. I really want to do everything I can to live a life I can enjoy so I try everything.

A couple of weeks ago I received my 23andyou results. It probably is wishfull thinking but perhaps some things can be explained because of genetics.
I've learned:

MTHFR:

MAO-A:
- R297R (T;T) Homozygous

Personality:

43,"Alright, so I suddenly had the urge to write this as I thought it's a very important message and could potentially save lives, no joke. I'll keep it
short and simple as possible while providing a bit of background on how I came to this conclusion. I want to make it clear that I am in no way a medical
professional, just someone who's had lots of experience with SSRI's for anxiety. So here goes.

In late 2015 I was perscribed Fleuoxetine (prozac in the US) for anxiety related to my OCD. It was tremendously helpful with the OCD but it came at a high price.
I stopped caring about what was causing my anxiety but I gradually stopped caring about anything else either. As time went on I felt more and more emotionless,
neither happy nor sad, just numb. I became distant, mean, arrogant and frustrated. I treated people like shit and made some horrible mistakes. I hated myself and
everything else. I had zero motivation to do anything and I felt like I was a total screw up in every single way.
I attemepted suicide twice, overdosing on painkillers. If I'm honest It was a pretty half-assed suicide attempt both times. 
I don't believe I truly wanted to die. I'd just given up on myself so I what I thought might be and easy and painless way out. I was
told by a doctor that if I'd tried it one more time then there's a good chance it would've worked. 

A month ago I decided enough was enough and told a doctor about what was going on. He perscribed Sertraline and I can honestly say this is
the best I've felt in a long time. I'm not saying it's all sunshine and roses but I feel like life is worth living again. I can enjoy things. The trade
off is my anxiety symptons are coming back but I'd take that over feeling like how I did any day.

My point is that If you start feeling like a different person to who you were after taking an SSRI for a long time then I believe it's
quite possible it is the SSRI and not you, and if you don't like that person then I recommend you talk to a doctor about it. Do whatever you need
to get better. Get therapy, try another drug. This is not an anti-SSRI message. It's just a message of caution. Go easy on yourself and realise that
you're not in control of every aspect of yourself. But that doesn't mean they can't change. I wouldn't have been able to pull myself out of that state
if it weren't for sertraline. It's not all on you.

There's people out there suffering worse than I've ever suffered in my life. As easy as it may me for me, I just want to say to those people that no matter
how bad things get, life is worth living, because it's all we have. If your present situation feels unbearable, look to the future and hope for something better
while doing whatever it is you need to do to improve your situation in the present moment. Only you can figure out what that is, and you CAN figure it out.
If you need help I recommend checking out Jordan Peterson's lectures on YouTube, or Sam Harris' talks and podcasts. Good luck.",15Aug2017,28,

46,"I've struggled with mental health issues since I was 15 (am now 30), but had gotten to a point where they were pretty mild last year. This year, however, they've been quite strong again. Depression, anxiety, and chronic headaches of a sometimes debilitating grade. I've tried a ton of different things to help with symptoms: exercise, healthier eating, CBT, meditation, yoga, supplements, nootropics. Had MRI done to ensure headaches weren't due to tumor, but no abnormalities were found. I'm in good shape, barely drink, and use no hard drugs. Still and yet, intense symptoms are not uncommon. 

Sometimes the headaches are so bad that I can't think at all or speak meaningfully. Sometimes I have intrusive suicidal thoughts that I have to just sit back and watch pass. Sometimes anxiety gets quite intense as well, racing thoughts, social anxiety, obsessive/intrusive grade thoughts. 

So I guess I'm looking for ideas on what to do. I've tried a lot of what's out there that has been suggested. I pretty much refuse to use daily SSRIs as the three I've tried had more intense side effects than medicinal effects.

Biofeedback, tcds, and these new minimally invasive technologies seem promising, but I haven't tried them. I was also looking at NSI-189, but that seems too experimental for my tastes despite some amazing success stories. Still has enough potential risk for me to want to wait for more research.

I've also been meaning to get back on CBD, but am trying to shift jobs first which may involve a drug test that apparently CBD can trigger. Hoping a shift in work plus getting back on CBD will have an impact, but I doubt it will be a silver bullet. CBD has helped mildly in the past with minimal impairment, though, so seems at least part of a broader solution.

49,"Hey, I don't really know what to say. I uh, set up an appointment to talk to someone about this tomorrow. I'm concerned that something is wrong with me. 

I lost my best friend a month ago or so. I didn't know why, he just said he wasn't sure he wanted anything to do with me. I gave him space, and time. I went to talk to him yesterday finally, and I couldn't tell you what we talked about specifically. It's clear what I remember isn't what happened. It's been proven to me that I've been at minimum texting his wife. They were separated right now while they recover from her cheating on him. She says I went over to her apartment and tried to kiss her. He says I confirmed it to him in person. I've seen texts that I sent him where I say that it happened. I ""lost"" all my texts at the beginning of the month, after these things happened. I can see that they happened in the times that they show, verified with my cell provider. The words are mine, I know my tone.

So, yeah, yesterday, I went to talk to him in person. If you'd asked me before and after, I'd tell you I was trying to figure out why he was mad at me. As I remember it, he tells me that all this happened, and I deny it, and he doesn't believe me. It's clear that isn't what happened. I come home from talking to him, and I recount it all to my wife, as I remember it. She sends him a message and they start talking about it more. I am okay with this, I tell her to do it, see what she can find out. See if we can repair this, he's my best friend and I love him. It starts coming out that I confirmed to him, face to face, yesterday, that these things happened. 

I'm flabbergasted to my wife. I start freaking out. I'm literally melting down. I read his messages and they are so believable. He's telling the truth, I know this man. I panic delete him from my friends, start to delete our shared friends, people I love and I cannot bear to lose. My wife stops me from this and tells me to calm down. It's spiraling, I cannot prove that this isn't the case. 

I don't understand. If I knew about all of these things, why did I pursue a friendship with him after it? I'd have to have known he wouldn't forgive me. Why would I tell my wife about it? Why would I be okay with her messaging him? Why would I help her look up my text history? 

I'm going to lose my family over this, because I can't own up to it. She doesn't believe that I can't remember any of this, and I don't believe me either. Except it doesn't make sense. We saw message history that shows that I was texting my friends wife at times that I know I was with my wife. I don't remember this. She wants me to tell her the truth, but I am. I don't know any other truth. I tried to say, okay, I own up to all this, and then she wants details to confirm that I believe it too, and I just don't have them. I can't say what happened specifically, I don't know what I text, I don't know what happened.

59,"I've had really bad anxiety for as long as I can remember. I've been diagnosed with GAD, but it definitely spikes up whenever I find myself in a stressful situation. Particularly, if I'm tired and really stressed out, I'll often hear what I've come to call loud thoughts. It's hard to explain, but it's kind of like you're wearing earphones and someone suddenly turns them on way too loud for a second or two. It's mostly nonsense, but it usually sounds like a human voice. As you might imagine, these thoughts definitely don't help with my anxiety lol.

Is this a bad thing? I mean, I don't think they're real people or anything, but it can't be good to randomly hear things, either. If anyone else has ever experienced this, how do you keep from becoming more and more anxious when you hear them?

I'd gotten myself into £2000+ of debt due to being unexplainably bad with money, I've had 4 different jobs in the past 2 years (Totalling about 5 months of actual work, leaving each job after a few weeks/a month). I started a company, then once it was officially on the company register, decided I couldn't be bothered anymore.

I feel like I'm so much better than supermarket or bar work; at school I was always one of the more naturally intelligent people there (Not trying to sound arrogant but it's just kinda how it was), yet halfway through year 10 (That's Grade 9 to my American friends) I dropped out, ended up getting homeschooled and other than getting myself into computing, done f**k all for 2 years, before I woke up and randomly decided I wanted to go to college (Not university). Despite having no grades, I managed to get into it, finished the first year with the highest grades in the class (90% of what we done was what I'd taught myself the 2 years prior so it wasn't that difficult). Then, the final year before university came, I just decided I couldn't be bothered anymore, and dropped out of that too). 

I thought all of this was sort of just related to me being a bit of an idiot, maybe a lack of willpower, but I spoke to my mum about myself as a child, and I was surprised. She said I used to get severe anxiety as a child and once chained myself to a radiator because I didn't want to go to preschool. My dad (who I don't live with), spoke to my mum numerous times thinking I had something wrong with me because I was supposedly so hyperactive, used to wander about the house aimlessly and would sit there doing weird things with my hands and legs constantly.  

Anyway, I spoke to the doctor about it and she said she thinks I have it, and has referred me to a mental health specialist. (She also said she gets people there all the time who claim they have it when they don't, so she refuses to refer them, so the fact she thinks I have it must say something).

Problem is, she told me I'd receive a letter about it within 5-6 weeks, and it's driving me absolutely crazy. I'm overwhelmed with excitement because I feel like I've had no kinda hope, I guess is the right word for myself, and this might answer a lot and help me sort my life out. But 5 weeks is just too far away; I'm 1 week in and I'm actually sitting at the living room window waiting for the postman. 

So my question is: To those who have ADHD, what can you do to improve yourself or sustain some patience? Because I feel like the time will never come and it's driving me mad. ",15Aug2017,1,
61,"This is my first post. Backround of myself, Im 20 years old and ive grown up in a divorced family for most of my life. My mother is bipolar and most of my family has a history of sever depression including myself. Ive been diagnosed with add and take vyvanse which seems to really help. I was misdiagnosed with bipolar and spent months on meds for it that did not seem to help at all. But recently ive been feeling like somthing else is wrong not just add. Its like i can never stay motivated or interested in anything. I go through these phases of wanting to do different things like cooking, construction,computers,business...etc. i get frustrated easy and somtimes snap. But i forgive instantly and get over it. Just writing thsi is difficult because my mind is all over the place. I know for sure its not depression or bipolar because ive been depressed and know what it feels like. I have had a recent suicide attempt because of it. Im sorry for the randomness of my post i just had to vent about it.  ",15Aug2017,1,
62,"(I got a second job at cafe because I am working to get debt free so I can leave this place and travel. i was working at another PT gig in customer service before this one but left because it was toxic. This place is customer service too which means it has the same pitfalls for me emotionally, but all in all is a pretty amazing PT job so I'm not keen on just quitting to avoid the difficulty)

Had some clarity today on something that causes me intense pain and suffering.
It’s something that I need to “suss out” so I can finally figure out how reduce it’s strangle hold over me.
It’s the constant insecurity, especially while working at the café (and also what I felt while working at the burger joint). The constant feeling like I’m brutally socially awkward and that customers can sense this. It’s not just that. It’s that I am sure that some of them laugh at me, smirk to themselves and their friends and make little barbed comments when they walk away from the til. I worry that I have a reputation as “that brutally awkward over sensitive weirdo who can’t get anything right”.
 I feel like some of the customers are picking me apart, judging things about me and delighting in viewing me as an inferior being. It guts me, it infuriates me. I obsess over instances with customers that were difficult, i.e- a customer had a knowing smile on their face while talking to me or at the end of our interaction as if I had done something horribly embarrassing. One guy made weirdly intense eye contact while smirking at me, it was like he was  trying to stare me down. One of the insecurities I have is around eye contact and I worry that the story some customers have who have interacted with me before is that I’m somehow trying to dominate people with my eye contact when all I’m ever trying to do is practice “natural” feeling eye contact. I’m sorta big and fairly heavily tattooed so I think some people might actually assume that I think I’m a tough guy or something, when really I’m quite insecure and struggling to just be natural and not be full of shame.
I feel like a big, messy, infected, open wound. I feel like people can see right through me. I feel like I can’t get things right. It eats me alive. I worry that there are people who think of me as a loser, a pathetic, awkward, weirdo who’s creepy and stupid. The thing is, based on the way some people treat me, I’m pretty sure that’s true. I know that much of that insecurity is in my head, that I’m just misinterpreting signals and thinking things are all about me. I know that’s a common cognitive distortion, the spotlight effect, and that it’s definitely at play here to some degree. (ok, to a large degree). But I also know that I come across as insecure. I get flush and start sweating very easily. I am on edge and make mistakes. I’m absent minded and it causes problems during rushes. But the level of  shame and insecurity I feel is so insanely disproportionate to anything I’ve done wrong and I can’t bear it anymore. I can’t stand taking my work home with me when there is no reason too. I can’t stand having so many painful memories of embarrassments from today, yesterday, and almost every day before that dominate so much of my thoughts. 
Writing about it now, breaking it down, makes it obvious how silly and illogical and wasteful it is to care so much about what other people think or are doing, or what I think they are thinking or doing.
Obviously if I’m dealing with a few hundred customers a day some of them will be weird with me and it will be because of their own crap and not something I did. Even if I do something embarrassing or absent minded that somehow affects them in some minorly negative way (you got my drink order wrong, YOU ruined my whaaaaaaaaaaa) then it says more about them than it does about me if they need to shit on me for that innocent mistake.
I worked another customer service job before this one and it was the same shit. I don’t want to quit because I want/need the extra money to achieve some goals, it gives me a social outlet and something to do, and I’m learning a lot in this job, and I know that my experience will be the same wherever I go so running away isn’t the answer, I’ve done that plenty in my life and it’s gotten me nowhere (not denying that sometimes it’s healthy to remove yourself from difficult situations, but in this case it’s not the best option for me).
Ohhh shame. Oh insecurity. Oh obsession. I’m going to die one day and I’m worried because some jerks like to make other people feel tiny and I let them do it to me, or, I’m worried because I imagine other people are doing things to make me feel tiny (probably a bit of both is happening).

There she be. thanks for reading!",15Aug2017,1,

iv been going out with my girlfriend over 2 years now. shes struggled fairly baldy with mental health throughout and it got so bad in the recent while shes had to go to hospital, iv always tried to help her out over our time together and she never lets me forget how much it has helped her. I hope this will motivate more people to talk about it because i know there is a lot of people out there that go through the same struggle , i have done so at times, but getting the the help and support of others can only be achieved by taking a step forward and talking about it to someone weather its a partner or a friend or a family member",15Aug2017,1,
