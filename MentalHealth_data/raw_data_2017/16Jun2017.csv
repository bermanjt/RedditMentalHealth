4,"So, title. 

I have been dealing with a workplace bully, creating a hostile environment for me. When I finally started standing up to myself and not taking their crap anymore, things actually started to get worse. I work for a school and it's now summer; the bully in question is kind of above me, but we're in different classifications, but I am NOT her personal secretary or anything like that. 

I have officially reported her but I don't know what will be done. 

Anyway, even though it is now summer, the tone for the next school year has been set it and it feels very threatening and rude and I'm so upset. 

How can I get over it? Admin said they will deal with this before the school year starts but I don't even know what that means. I know there isn't anything I can do until August so I shouldn't let it affect me, but it does. The last week I have been so tired, I barely eat, I don't sleep well at all, and I have a lot of physical ailments that are happening to me. How can I stop thinking about it? How can I get it, get her out of my mind? ",16Jun2017,5,

6,So i've been in therapy for a while and I feel i'm doing good for a bit but i always fall back into a depression. even when i'm happy i can't shake the suicidal thoughts and all that. Should i see a psychiatrist and get some medication? where do i start? how did you get out of your depression? ,16Jun2017,1,
7,"I don't know why im even posting this, i have nobody to talk to, my partner is at work, i don't want to worry him. My daughter is upstairs asleep, the other one is at school. I just cut my wrists. Not enough to die, so that's not an issue. Just so the world around me can stop, everything feels like its going along normal and my entire world is crashing into a bottomless pit. Why? no fucking reason. None. I ran out of meds yesterday, and i haven't got around to picking more up, its not supposed to make me feel this bad just by missing one day but here i am. I can't do it anymore. My life isn't bad, but why do i feel like nothing will ever be ok. I just want it to stop. Is this my life forever? Being dependant on this medication? This spiral of hopelessness just never ending? I feel average at best and suicidal at worst. I'd do it right now, if i didn't have an infant upstairs who needed me. I don't know what i'm wanting to gain from this post, just to pretend i actually have someone to vent to, i suppose. ",16Jun2017,1,
8,"When I was 8, a stranger would call my house regularly and talk with me about school and what I was interested in. He was my friend. It then turned into him asking me to do things like touch myself or asking me to describe my body.  I remember realizing it was wrong and demanding he never call back. I have yet heard about other instances of this and I don't know how to label it. 

I am going to bring it up with my therapist, but we were dealing with OCD and post partum issues the last 6 months. However working through the above issues made me remember these events. 

Help is appreciated ",16Jun2017,1,

10,"I'm a 41 year old woman.  My entire adult life, I've struggled with depression and debilitating anxiety.  I've been diagnosed with ADD, Bipolar Disorder, and Asperger's Syndrome, all of which were clearly false.  I've also been diagnosed with PTSD.  I've worked with a bunch of different counselors and tried a bunch of different medications, with little improvement to my mental and emotional health. 

About a year ago, I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, and I started working with a counselor who is familiar with BPD.  Suddenly, my progress skyrocketed.  With the help of my current counselor, I've made great strides in self-love, self-respect, and self-trust.  I've started to learn how to look at the world and at people realistically.  She gives me tools I can actually use in situations I've always been totally lost in in the past.  I'm no longer depressed, and I'm making great progress with my anxiety.  I feel like a different person today than I did this time last year. 

Last spring, I moved from the west coast (USA) to the east coast to live near my boyfriend who I met at about the same time I got my BPD diagnosis.  I'm still able to work with the same amazing counselor via a program similar to Skype.  My boyfriend and I have a great relationship, which is a first for me; my previous relationships have ranged from boring or annoying to abusive.  My healthy, respectful, and fun relationship with my current boyfriend is one of the biggest things in my life that proves to me how far I've come in my mental health growth over the past year. 

The problem is, although my boyfriend is a wonderful person who I love very much, he's not very good at being emotionally supportive in the way I sometimes need.  I accept that about him, but lately, I have been feeling the need to have someone in my life I can have that kind of connection with. 

I've always had trouble making friends.  I have one friend I'm still semi-close with who lives in my old state, but we only occasionally talk on the phone.  In the past, I've met people when I volunteered at charities.  I'd love to do that again since it was a rewarding experience for me, but I won't be doing that any time soon, since when I'm not working, I'm spending time with my boyfriend or finishing an online course for a self-employed business I hope to start soon.  At this time, the only people I spend time with are my boyfriend and my coworkers, so I'd like to make friends with someone at work.  I'd like to start with a casual friendship with light conversation, and I'd eventually like to have a close friendship in which we both feel comfortable sharing private concerns and getting support and feedback. 

This might sound like an easy thing to some people, but to me, it's a mystery.  That's partly because I find most people boring and annoying.  A big part of why I mostly keep to myself is because I get easily frustrated with most people's topics of conversation.  I'm currently working at an entry-level retail job with a major international retail chain.  Although most of my coworkers are nice people, as far as I can tell, they're not deep thinkers.  I hope it doesn't sound like I'm looking down on them; everyone has different priorities in life, and I think mine are different than theirs.  But I'm hoping that among my many coworkers is a hidden mind who wants to have these kinds of conversations too.  I hope to find a friend who is willing and able to respectfully and intelligently listen and share on topics of deep emotional concerns. 

When I started this job, I thought I'd only be there for a couple months, just until I finished my online course and started my business.  It's taken longer than I expected to finish the course, and I've already been at the job for nearly three months and I'm still not finished with the course.  I recently surprised myself by deciding to apply for a higher level, semi-supervisory position at the company.  If I'm chosen for the job, I'll be full time with benefits and a big pay bump.  I'll have more responsibility and more mental challenges.  So, I may be staying at this company for another year or more. 

If I do move up the corporate ladder at this company, it may be easier to find peers who are interested in meaningful intelligent conversation.  (Again, I hope this isn't coming off as disparaging to my entry-level coworkers; they are mostly great people and I wish them well with whatever their goals are.) 

Does anyone have any feedback about any of this?  Is this a reasonable goal?  How should I go about searching for a potential friend?  Or maybe, I'm not giving my coworkers enough credit, and they are interested in the kinds of conversation topics I'm interested in, but they don't know how to start those kinds of conversations either!  What do you think I should do? 


TL;DR: 

My beloved boyfriend isn't good at emotions, so I'm hoping to find a friend among my seemingly unambitious and mentally lazy coworkers.

11,"TLDR version: Hey everyone I recently made some lame attempts to find a therapist and keep making excuses to not try again (I feel better today, I'll be happy once I accomplish this, etc). What did you do to mentally and physically get over the wall of refusing to admit you could use help and then actually go get it?

Long story with background version: I've been to a therapist before while I was in grad school and unable to manage the stress. It made me acutely aware of some underlying chronic problems I had always tried to shrug off and were being exacerbated by stress, but I mostly played it off as ""I'm stressed from school I'm losing it help."" So I never got around to the deeper issues which was frustrating. I remember one moment after finishing my defense when the counselor asked ""Congratulations! So how do you feel??!"" and I pretty much said ""Meh."" I got an incredulous look and a ""Most people would be proud!"" type of response and I thought to myself ""Well duh that's because I'm probably depressed"" (But I never admitted that to him). Due to that and scheduling conflicts I simply never went back. Now I'm in a new state with a temporary job and I really noticed and enjoyed the days when I wasn't in panic attack mode, but the loneliness and despair stuck around. When things got busy and the time came to consider my next step the anxiety returned (not usually as bad as before). It may be I have a social anxiety type disorder that led to feelings of being an outcast thus depression. Sometimes I feel like I make up all my problems because I'm paranoid or a hypochondriac.

13,"I'm a 22 year old female who recently graduated college and moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in the arts. I'm extremely cerebral and it's difficult for me to not only connect with people (due to my own sense of self, not them- so it really does feel like it's me), but connect with myself. I've been told countless times I'm brilliant, beautiful, driven, &amp; bla bla bla bla bla. I have a history in modeling but it's nothing major. I feel an overwhelming sense of emptiness and sadness. Sadness from the past, my horrific childhood, the hopelessness of the present, &amp; the inability to see anything positive for my future. I feel so broken and damaged due to the abuse I received from my parents (owners is how I like to think of them). They abused me for twenty years until I finally got away but the emotional pain from the mental, physical, &amp; sexual abuse has been rendering me unable to act, to feel and not to feel, to think myself into oblivion and watch life float away into a sea of haziness. 

It's as though my will is losing out, I can't transcend my own facticity and constantly watch my lived experience level down to the point of futility. It's as if I'm a passive nihilist who can't get out of her own mind. Awareness of myself has lead to such a headache that I wish to shut off. I can't take a leap of faith because I can't believe anything positive about myself, no matter how many compliments I receive, it doesn't satiate me. I often perceive everyone to be thinking negatively of me but I realize that's due to the imposed fantasy I put onto any situation. 

I'm a very physical Being but I can't get into my flow, it's due to the Body Dysmorphic Disorder that developed from being an overweight child who ate to cope because she wasn't enough for her parents. It comes from being violated and feeling like used trash that was forgotten to be thrown out. I feel so hopeless because I'm a mixed woman of color who has the potential but lacks the drive to initiate the change which can fulfill my expectations of myself. It's feeling guilty and horrible for even complaining about this when it's a luxury to be able to think on first world issues. It's losing the only woman I have ever loved because my parents wanted to marry me off and due to being gaslighted growing up, I partook in the dismantling of my own relationship. 

I'm so in over my head and this isn't even 20% of it. Has anyone felt like this? I'm so afraid I'm going to terminate myself. But I'm more afraid to live. I'm not sure what to make of this abyss I've landed into. Liberation is painful but I never expected the creation of meaning &amp; myself to frighten me into a catatonic state (emotionally &amp; physically). 

Any input would be welcomed. 

Have a beautiful night. ",16Jun2017,3,

17,"I don't know all the details, she is in her late 20s and was in an abusive relationship in rural NY. She requires medication that would cost something like $600 a month out of pocket but was covered in NY under social services. 

Her family offered to have her move there so she did and she works under the table making minimum wage at a family business. Got away from abusive situation but that was traded off for now her family not wanting to pay for her medications (Texas doesn't have expanded Medicare or whatever it is that will help her). They said they'd take care of it but now won't. 

She has another month of meds that can be forwarded from NY but beyond that is out of luck.

Her family now has her working under the table minimum wage and is abusive, saying her facial expressions aren't ok to match what they want her to be for specific emotional responses and such (she deals with abuse blankly) and they have a belief that medication isn't necessary.

I've advised she move out and away from the whole state but she has no resources. There are no public transit options where she is, I don't know the specifics of the town but it isn't close enough to get anywhere. 

I've just told her to just hold on.

Does anyone know where I should point her to for help? 

She's even considered homeless shelters but there's nothing in her area. 

In a month and a half she'll lose the meds that keep her balanced and her family is of no help, if anything they're abusive and will only make things worse. The whole thing is a countdown to an explosion that could end with her being hospitalized or worse.

Does anyone have any ideas I could send her way?",16Jun2017,1,
18,"I don't even know where to start really. 27 years old, Australia.

I have always had some anxiety, eating problems and depression but up until this year had a zest for life, enjoyed meeting new people and doing new things, setting goals, even though it was sometimes hard. 

Recently it all seems pointless. I don't want to meet new people, I don't want to even leave the house. The only people I truly trust  and want in my life are my parents, but they won't be around forever, so it makes me sad knowing that. I feel like I am a disappointment to them even though they are the most supportive and loving parents anyone could ask for. I have friends but I don't catch up with them anymore or even respond when they contact me.

I just have no motivation to do social or active things like I used to, it scares me to be honest. I don't want to set goals because I never reach them. I smoke a lot. I binge eat a lot - I look healthy so I guess it doesn't get noticed but it makes me feel worthless and disgusting.

21,"So, apologies, this is going to be a little long, but I want to take the time to really write this all down; for myself, if nothing else.

I remember the person I was on my way to becoming in my senior year of high school. He was charming, funny, and described as a person who lit up a room by his close friends, of whom he had a good few. At the end of my senior year something inside me just started feeling really off, like who I was was fading away a bit. I felt like, and still feel like most of the time when I say or do anything I am not 100% the one physically doing them, just like I'm watching it all happen from far away inside myself.
Now I'm finishing my junior year of university, 3 years later. 
It's like that person that I was working so hard to become died, and for the past 3 years I've been an awkward mess of a person, saying all of the wrong things, and acting the wrong way, all in an act to pick up those shattered pieces. The irony is that in doing so, the depression, anxiety, and (I'm assuming) dissociation have gotten progressively worse, to the point that now I am basically silent 90% of the time. The opportunities when my brain actually works socially enough to say anything at all, I fuck it up by either saying the wrong thing for the moment, or not making sense in the slightest.
The friends I had in highschool are gone and I don't see them more than once a year, so talking to them is kind of out of the question. The friends I've made since arriving at college have never even seen the real me, but they're getting tired of the person they have gotten to know for 3 years. They never talk to me anymore, and when I try to initiate conversation, they never put in half of the effort to keep it up. They certainly don't include me in their plans. Communication is all on me, and with my worsening mentality I just can't do that either.
Depression has gotten rid of any interests I once had, and this feeling of being absent from myself has prevented me from finding any others. 
I've realised my current friends are adding to my own problem, but finding new friends when I can't even find myself is something that I can't even begin to fathom how to do.
I thought I could handle all of this back when it started. It was fine; I was ""just going through a slump"". I was 18, I was a ""man now"", going away to college. I thought nothing could touch me. I was wrong.
Life feels pointless, I wake up most days thinking it would be so much easier if I were dead, and most of the time can't bring myself to get out of bed until late in the afternoon anymore. Some days I even miss classes because I physically can't make myself go. 
I don't understand. I come from a wonderful and caring family who are all happy and completely functional. I feel like I'm broken, and alone.
I don't know what to do, and I honestly just want so badly to stop feeling the way that I do. I want to be normal, but I can't even remember what normal is. 
I dont know what to expect, so I'm not expecting anything. I've never used Reddit before, but I needed a place to see my thoughts in front of me, and I've heard good things. Thank you for reading.",16Jun2017,2,

We moved back to the UK not long ago (we're 19) and she's not putting much effort into getting in touch with old friends. She's got a job, but she rarely replies to her same-age colleagues when they get in touch to chat. She doesn't have any interests or hobbies to speak of, she doesn't go to clubs even though she likes clubbing, and when home from work in the evening she generally scrolls online until she goes to bed.

26,"I've been afraid to post there here on reddit for a while now because I'm embarrassed and because I know that feeling this way is not considered normal or socially acceptable.

I'm afraid of what people would think of me, especially if they clicked on my profile to find the threads I've been making and saw this. People might think I hate them for their dimorophic bodies. And, in a worst case scenario, someone might suspect me of being a pedophile or some kind of similar pervert, because of the fact that a lot of the sexual dimorphism is caused by puberty(secondary sex characteristics are a major component of the sexual dimorphism).

I'm afraid to even say why I might feel this way. I'm afraid of how people would take it if I said so, I'm afraid people wouldn't understand. My best guess is that I'm afraid, I'm afraid of men and women being different and the concept of that. And because of that

But even then, I couldn't still be happy with an accept and be comfortable with the sexual dimorphism and still believe that gender roles, gender stereotypes, evolutionary psychology or the sexism inside of Evo Psych is wrong. And yet I seem to have so deeply internalized a connection between body and the stereotypes I am uncomfortable with, I seem to have rejected difference at all on some psychological level.

I don't even know what's going on. Is this a sign that I haven't fully been able to de-internalize the gender stereotypes taught to me by society, and my discomfort comes from 


Also, before you ask, I have told a therapist about this before. She admittedly wasn't much help. She thinks my biggest problem in life is that I haven't ""grown up"" and ""accepted adulthood"". Partly because I have been bad at job stability, partly because of the abuse my family did to me and their non-acceptance of me haunts me to this day. And partly because I am deep into hobbies she has deemed childish like Pokemon(I'm a really big fan of Pokemon and Nintendo games, as well as cartoons and anime, and she seemed to think this was a problem and a sign of arrested development).

Also, as a whole she left is as a non-issue, shrugged her shoulders and said she didn't think it was a big deal and maybe it was just my taste. And asked me if I wanted to talk about something else. I can tell the way I feel is a big deal to society, but it didn't seem like a big deal to her, at all.


I understand many here would recommend I see a therapist before anything else, but believe me when I say that I've tried and been trying and not with a great deal of luck.

Anyway, I kind of wanted to get this off my chest because I know these feelings aren't normal, but I have them anyway. Very deeply and passionately, even. I'm not sure what to make of it and I'm embarrassed to post this on reddit and have people's judgement, not just here but anyone who would look through my user profit. But keeping this bottled up and not knowing what's going on isn't fun.

It causes me anxiety to know that I have these strange and socially unacceptable feelings that defy biological reality and in some ways seem downright misanthropistic towards the human body and the reality I was born into.

Does anyone have advice or ideas of what might be going on other than ""see a therapist"".

At the risk of giving yet another person an ad hominem attack against me when I get in an argument on reddit and they try to arguing I'm wrong because ""mental unwellness"", I'm getting this off my chest here. Please help.",16Jun2017,1,
27,"What is wrong with my wife?

We’ve been together 6 years. None of what I’m about to detail was present or obvious in the first two years. By the third year I’d realized she’d developed a drinking problem, which has exacerbated the matters  I’m about to lay out but which can’t be the source, I’m sure.  For context, we are both in our mid thirties.

I am having so much difficulty writing this post, I want to put it in chronological order but I just can’t remember the exact dates for every episode and there have been so many. I’ll start with the worst episode she’s had and then work around from there.

We moved into a new house 1.5 years ago. She was well into her drinking problem stage at this point and it was a constant source of contention with us. I had spent two years trying to cut her drinking down and had gotten to the point where she would grudgingly agree to 1 or 2 days of the week not drinking, which was a victory.
  The day we moved into this new house she stopped drinking completely for six days straight which was unheard of at this point. She would never stop drinking of her own accord, I always had to force the issue. This time, she did it of her own volition.

She spent those six days sitting in our new lounge room just gazing out the window at cars going by and was very unresponsive to me during this time.

Whenever I’d try talk to her she’d gently fob me off with as few words as possible and eventually I’d just stick my head in the lounge every few hours to...just see what she was doing, and she was always doing the same thing, just sitting there staring out the window. Literally 8 hours a day she would be doing this. She asked me several times over this period if I could hear the orchestra/choral music coming out of the air vents, I thought she was nuts but played along and listened to the vents and conceded that I could hear the traffic and airflow and maybe that’s what she was hearing? She insisted that I just couldn’t hear properly though and that there was a choral singing coming through the air vents and even sang it for me.

A friend from overseas came to stay with us a day later over New Years and that night the three of us were drinking.
 She wanted to drink again suddenly and seemed back to her old self again and was in her usual normal high spirits, friendly and gregarious. I left at one point and came back to hear her detailing something absolutely bizarre to him. 
She was telling him in all earnestness that she’d been hearing the voice of a man called Bryan who had told her that she was going to be his queen but only after she went through the rainbow gate/bridge .  Upon further questioning, she admitted that she’d have to commit suicide to be with him but that she was adamantly opposed to that idea and thought it was stupid. 
She was still discussing all this as if it were perfectly reasonable. I stayed hidden around the corner from her listening, however our friend could see me and I encouraged him via hand and eye signals to keep her talking so I could get more information. It went on in the same vein for the next hour, promises from some entity called Bryan who didn’t like me at all and was the reason we hadn’t had sex in the past week (he told her not to trust me and not to sleep with me)

Our friend left the next day to stay with other friends, telling me he was deeply uncomfortable with what had passed.  Shortly after this, she seemed to snap out of it all, she began interacting with me like normal again, she began drinking again, regrettably, and she admitted that she had heard voices and angels singing but that “that was in the past, I was just being silly, god I’m so embarrassed”. 

That’s all I can remember properly of that time – on to the current day-  Many times I find her having some kind of manic episode, where her  eyes will be glazed and staring just slightly out of phase with where they should  be,  and she will be laughing maniacally at the smallest things and it won’t be her normal laugh, it’s either some kind of horrific forced sounding caricature of a laugh or an angry grunting one. Engaging her during one of these episodes results in a momentary embarrassed snap back to normality before resuming.

I found her on the floor again recently, yelling and arguing with the air. There was a lot of swearing and growling and snarling –it sounded like Klingon for gods sake, I imagine this is what people refer to when they talk about people speaking in tongues.
 This has happened many times, and whenever (after watching silently for however long) I make my presence known, she immediately snaps into a semblance of her normal self and seems to be embarrassed, apologizing yet never really addressing what she’d just been doing.
 She will make it clear that she knows she’s been doing something wrong but it is utterly impossible to get her to pin it down, you can’t communicate properly with her in these moments, the conversations become cyclical and repetitive and go nowhere. 
Important to mention here too that even after she’s snapped back to normality and apologised in her normal voice, once I leave the room she will return almost immediately to growling and snarling and cursing loudly at god knows what. (If I then go back into the room, she will return to normality briefly before slowly degenerating into a cyclical nonsensical conversation)

I should point out here that at this point I’ve been in control of her finances utterly for years now due to her drinking. I have become acutely aware of her changes in mood and disposition and can tell within seconds if she has had anything to drink. 
I realise that might seem a bold claim but I have lived with her for nearly 6 years now and am absolutely familiar with all her behaviour, her drinking is an open book for me now. I control our money,  I know where our last fifty cent coin is. 
I mention this because I want to stress that her behaviour can’t simply be ascribed to the booze or lack of it. On days when she has had nothing to drink, she has been wonderful and gentle and enthusiastic about life, but upon dozing off briefly beside me on the couch or in bed (we’re talking 5 minutes) she will awaken and her eyes will be out of phase and...it’s hard to describe. 
They’re focussing but barely and they seem glazed. Her voice goes higher when this happens too and she apparently forgets where she is and what she’s doing. Her voice remains high and slightly breathy during these instances (she has a husky voice for a female so it’s especially noticeable – her normal relaxed voice is vastly different from the sound of her voice during one of these fugue states, as I refer to them) She will repeat phrases like “it’s all wrong” over and over and over and when pressed for clarification is unable to give any answer beyond “IT is wrong. Just IT.”  
Absolutely unable or unwilling to answer questions in a straight manner – like I said earlier, questioning her only ends up with a cyclical conversation, IE – 
IT’S WRONG
What’s wrong?
ALL OF IT. 
What it?
YOU KNOW. ALL OF IT
I don’t know, can you tell me?
TELL YOU WHAT?
What’s wrong?
ALL OF IT
Right, but what ‘it’ are you talking about?
IT. YOU KNOW.
I don’t know, what it?
UGH IT. IT IS ALL WRONG	
That will go on a dozen different ways but always end up the same. There is absolutely no pinning her down to a proper answer .

She keeps going into these fugue states where she insists something is wrong and that people are coming to kill me, that I have to run and hide. The first time she pulled that one out, I was half asleep and I can’t describe the shiver that came over my soul, I came awake quickly thinking my life was in danger before realizing she was just talking random mess again. That particular idea of hers came to a head tonight when I was driving back from the gym and received a call from her panicking that men had just come to the front door and walked inside demanding to know where the drugs were.
 I was in the car turning at the corner less than 20m away at this point so I pulled up outside our house within seconds and she came running out to meet me and pointed to the man who had been at the door. I got out, leaving the car running on the road which is a testament to how shaken I was,  and asked him if I could help him, he was a young asian with his mother and aunt? I’m not sure who the ladies were but I turned to my wife and asked her if she was sure this was the right person upon which she started mumbling that it probably wasn’t the same person. I was mortified and apologised to the three strangers and guided my wife back inside the house where she spent the next two hours in the bedroom yelling and cursing at thin air. 

She has just emerged now and politely and gently thanked me for the dinner I made earlier. She’s normal again now. 
Anyway, everything I’ve just detailed is getting worse and more frequent. 
These incidents used to be something that happened every few months which was rare enough to shrug off, then it suddenly became fortnightly and now it’s every second day. 
Every second night I lie in bed next to her listening to her swear at nonexistent people and occasionally punching the headboard. I beg her to be quiet so I can sleep and she responds with nonsense. In the morning though she is back to her original beautiful self and I start doubting myself. 


I’ve typed so much here. I realise it’s a mess, I have a few more items that are salient.  Before we lived alone together we lived with a mutual friend, around 3 years ago. He came home one night while I was at work to find her swaying in the front window with her face covered in blood. 
 He pressed on inside not knowing what was waiting for him, bless him, and found she’d fallen over and he took her to the ER even though she insisted nothing was wrong and was smiling and wandering around the house like everything was normal, covered in blood. 
Before they left in a taxi to the ER our friend said he’d seen a large pool of blood in the back yard where presumably she’d fallen and hit her head and then lain for god knows how long. (Pool of blood was gone when we all got home, I’m assuming our dog lapped it up)

I took her home from the ER that night and we both shared a cigarette while we waited for a taxi, she passed out again shortly afterward and hit her head on the ground when she fell in front of our front door. Ever since then, she often becomes massively dizzy and falls asleep/passes out within minutes of smoking a cigarette, which never happened prior. 
I fear I was negligent in not taking her back to the ER after she hit her head that second time on the way home and wonder all the time if my reluctance to make a second trip to the hospital has resulted in exacerbated damage to her, was it a concussion? Should I have taken her back again? 
She has visited our family doctor 2 dozen times since then and he’s certified her fit for duty but I’m also fairly certain she is glossing over details and not giving him the full story. I have told her that I will go to him (family doctor) together with her to discuss this so we can get it all straight but she insists I’m not allowed to come, that visiting him is her safe place and she doesn’t want to disappoint him. (her words)

I’ve also tried to have her committed once but the police present at the time said they couldn’t do that unless she’d threatened her own life.

Anyway fuck someone help me please, point me in a direction, I need to do something because this is just getting worse and worse. I’ve spent hours writing this up and it’s late for me, I have to work early AM so I’m just going to post now and hope for something useful I can find tomorrow.

29,"i just want an answer to my illness. depression and anxiety coupled with a shitty upbringing have crippled me to the point where i constantly wonder if i will ever be a normal, functioning person. i CONSTANTLY feel embarrassed and i have no idea why. leaving the bedroom is embarrassing. going out to cook is embarrassing. when my bf's mom comes around the kitchen corner i feel super uncomfortable and don't know what to do. do i say hi? should i cross my arms? sit down? will she notice my chicken is burning right now because i'm too shy to get up and turn off the heat while she's here? my hair looks really messy too. will she smell that i haven't showered in 3 days because i can't bring myself to? going outside to get the mail is embarrassing, this shirt makes me look fat. yelling at the dog to come in is embarrassing...they'll hear my voice, and maybe notice the dog doesn't respect me and she isn't trained well, like other dogs. even leaving to shower is embarrassing. asking about someone's day is embarrassing. why am i so ashamed?????",16Jun2017,1,

I've always had depression, and this is making me much much worse. I was on the rise, bringing the thoughts down to much more occasionally but now I don't feel thrilled about anything. I'm starting to lose sight of any point. Theres less and less reasons to keep going daily, cause I'm just not going anywhere. Nowhere wants me, I'm just a burden on everyone I know, and even the occasional time I get away from home is just a tease of what life would be like if I was just someone better",16Jun2017,1,
31,"I (18F) have had severe anxiety since I was around 13/14 starting with bullying at school. It led to me having severe issues with accepting many things about myself and I became an insecure mess, which I'm sure wasn't helped by puberty and hormones. I was never good at making friends and was never very good at interacting with people (still can't do it unless I practice beforehand - talking to some people made me realise I might have Aspergers?)

I became very self-conscious and hated and avoided almost all social interaction due to the fear of embarrassing myself or getting picked on. I wanted to apply for special consideration for my GCSE exams because I'd have frequent panic attacks and being in such a large hall with over 300 students made me very anxious, but I couldn't go to a doctor to get a diagnosis without my parents wanting to know. Mental health isn't a thing that my family accept or talk about and it's seen as a stigma, so that put me off. I ended up having to step out of the exams for 30-45 minutes at a time, which I wasn't given back, so I barely got the grades to continue with A levels. For my A2 exams, they've been more considerate and put me in a room with other special educational needs students, but I still don't get any extra time whilst others with a formal diagnosis get theirs. 

I finally had enough of the panic attacks and the horrid feeling of my chest tightening up and finding it impossible to breath in public, in unknown areas or with people I didn't know, and went to see my GP in October 2016. He wasn't very helpful and said I can go for online cognitive behavioural therapy or take antidepressants. I opted for the therapy and got a form to refer myself to it. I've been seeing a therapist online since then, and she's been completely useless and almost half of our hour sessions are spent with her slowly typing one sentence answers. She wants to discharge me from her care soon because we've done more than 6 sessions. 

I went back to another GP and this time, I came away with another referral to get another therapist, a formal diagnosis, antidepressants and the knowledge that I was referred to CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services) back in October 2016. I was never told I would be referred to CAMHS, so I didn't know I was meant to be expecting a letter from them. After looking at the letters for the original appointment and then another missed appointment letter, i realised the other GP put in the wrong address for me so I never received my referral to CAMHS which would have helped me so much more than IAPT (Adult Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme). I'm now too old to have access to CAMHS and the GP didn't have any other mental health services in my area than IAPT. 

My school were very useless and only wanted to help if I had sufficient evidence, which I was too anxious to go and get due to my parents finding out. I even tried to speak to them about how I felt about possibly having Aspergers and they dismissed it completely. They asked a few questions like if I always played alone as a child or if I had trouble making friends, but that was it. 

I'm still angry about the thing that happened with CAMHS and I feel like I missed out on something that could have helped me. I don't feel like IAPT is useful and I don't know what to do now. 

TL;DR I got a formal diagnosis for generalised anxiety disorder, but I'm not getting the help I need, due to negligence from my GP as well as the options that were given to me being unhelpful.

34,"I have been dealing with some rather debilitating bouts of depression of late.  Much of it has been cyclical for most of my life; however, it's recently began to progress to the point where it's affecting nearly every aspect of my life (33 years).  

After years of struggling, I've finally reached out to get some professional help, as the ""experiment"" of dealing with it all on my own has been an objective failure.  And I've come to terms with the fact that that isn't necessarily something I need to be ashamed of.  

What I'm wondering is: what sort of things can I do in preparation for these sessions to get the most out of them? Or more specifically, is it appropriate to bring in ""lists"" of things I want to talk about? Or is it more appropriate to let my counselor lead with questions best suited to diagnosing my underlying issues?

What I want to avoid is operating under the assumption that I have all the answers.  I don't.  But I'm also paranoid that the moment I walk out the door, I'll remember that I failed to mention something important.  Thank you for any feedback.  ",16Jun2017,2,

38,"Hey folks,

I don't know how to structure this as I have a lot of small things going on and I don't know which are relevant and which are not, so bear with me.

I started university last fall, not US college, it's a lot different where I live. Very focused on the academics, instead of a ""college experience"", no clubs except political and sports. I'm very lonely, even though I get along with people. I used to be bullied as a child and here I'm not, no one actively seems to dislike me, I'm accepted, but I have no friends. I'm a very nerdy person, most people here aren't. The only group of friends I've had in my life was in high school and it took me four years to find them. It's hard to summarise here, for more background check out my post history. Basically, I'm lonely, I feel like I can't relate to anyone here, I feel like I'm always putting on a mask.

One on one interaction is awkward. I don't like hanging out with my friends from back home except in large groups where no one expects me to keep the conversation going myself. My three closest friends are all in one way or another struggling with depression, be it constant, on and off or very sudden because of a loss. I used to love being the person people could talk to about their problems but I decided a month or so ago that I couldn't take it anymore and I stopped. Being a (however voluntary) punching bag for so long has made me a bit resentful of my friends and even though when I hang out with my best friend we have fun, I still don't usually want to. There's just no motivation. I go along with it and yeah it's kinda fun I guess but I'm so glad when he leaves, to be entirely honest.

The only person I'm genuinely happy to be around a lot is my boyfriend. We broke up for a few months last year because I couldn't stop thinking that this wasn't right, it wasn't good enough, he wasn't good enough, he loved me more than I loved him or that I didn't love him at all. I was distant a lot and confessed my extreme doubts to him which ended in a few horrible crying fits that stole several weekends from us. Eventually he broke it off. I later found out about a type of OCD that manifests like this, went to a therapist and he confirmed that he also thinks that was going on. Boyfriend and I got back together, I was symptom free for several months, had a few weeks that gradually got worse and now, like a switch flipped, 100% symptom free again from what I can tell. It's been fine for several weeks now.

Again, I don't know if that's even relevant. I guess I would say my main problem is how emotional I get. I'm very irritable towards my best friend and we fight a lot because of it. I just can't be a kind person a lot of the time and I hate myself for it. I pour all my energy into being a good girlfriend because my god, I love my boyfriend, reddit. I want this to work so badly, I don't want to lose him again, I want this person by my side. And I'm so scared of messing it up. Of being wrong. There's so many rules. Bring up every problem before it becomes a big one. But don't mention small things, just accept them. Speak his love languages and teach him yours, but at the same time don't because you must not change him. Love him the way he is and don't change anything, but do ask for change if it's necessary in order for your needs to be met.

It sounds ridiculous, but there's so much contradiction everywhere, and by trying to do it right I just end up being selfish and doing it wrong. I talk a lot and he's bad with words, but I feel most loved through words. So I figured tell him and teach him how to give you what you need, but I just ended up criticising him all the time and him feeling bad. So now I'm trying to speak his language and rely less on verbal communication. I want this to work and I firmly believe I can make it work.

The thing is... It's not even a big issue. At all. Until suddenly it is. Whenever I notice a small problem, or something hurts me even just slightly (even stupid things), I get so worked up about them and I just spiral. We can be talking about some good memories when we used to talk on the phone every day (when we were super recently in love) and before I know it two hours have passed and I'm crying my eyes out thinking how can our relationship even ever work, because he ""never cares to call me"" and it ""can't be that hard"" and stupid shit like that. But in that moment it feels so real and so big and like such a huge letdown. I don't call him much because I know he's busy a lot so I give him space, but when I'm that emotional it's all warped into this really bad thing that spells doom for our relationship.

I usually snap out of it and feel better when he tells me it's fine, he understands and he'll call me next week, okay? I feel better then, but it instantly morphs into self-hatred. I'm so so angry at myself for criticising him AGAIN, that I should have seen it's really not that big of a problem and that I'm being a shitty girlfriend. The one time he mentioned how criticized he feels (most of it is my assumption and common sense, as I said he's not that good at expressing his feelings verbally) my heart broke, I felt horrible, like I was abusing him and treating him terribly and all the good things I do in the relationship or the bad things he does just didn't count anymore. I was just horrible. I snapped out of that after a while, of course, but I obviously still feel bad for treating him the way I do. Just less... extreme I suppose.

How do I control my emotions, reddit? How do I know when I'm spiralling into something stupid and it's not as bad as I think it is? How do I snap out of it before hurting him and myself? How do I not overreact in *general* (this happens to some degree in other parts of my life, but very minor in comparison)? Do you think something's actually wrong with me, health wise, and if so, do you have any suspicions? I've thought about seeking professional help but it's so hard to view it as a problem when I'm not *right in the middle* of it. I remember I cried my eyes out last night over the calling thing but I don't remember how I got to that conclusion or how the hell I even thought it was that big of a problem in the first place. I just completely lose sight of the big picture in those moments (minutes, hours, ...). 

Any input or advice is very much appreciated. Questions, if you have any, as well. I'll answer anything as good as I possibly can. I just want to get some insight, please.

Thank you for reading.",16Jun2017,2,
39,"So first off while I do go through depression and anxiety latently, I think the reason right now is some health issues I have that are making my stomach flare up really bad. It's similar to Chrohns where I'm not absorbing nutrients well and when I have bad days with my stomach i tend to also have anxiety and depression that I just can't kick like when it's just a mood that I can kinda think myself out of.

Anyway, I woke up today and I just hate my life. I have no wants or needs right now, I want nothing at all to do with anything. My life isn't that bad - I love my job and I live with my loving boyfriend. But I just hate everything right now. I wanna cry, I wanna scream, I want to not exist.

40,"Hey everyone I am wondering if I am exhibiting podromal schizophrenia or this is just sequale from MDD and anxiety. I know you cannot be formally diagnosed over the internet but I appreciate input from this awesome subreddit

About myself: 23M, college grad matriculating to med school in August, no known psych hx in family except my grandmother's brother has bipolar. Mild depression that has been controlled by lifestyle and running (ran 2 marathons in the past). Smoked weed less than 10 times, and never used any amphetamines. Drank a lot in college.

Anyways about 6 months ago I had an existential crisis that tore my entire world view down. Cue 48 hour panic attack without sleeping. I realized life has no meaning and our time here is short etc etc. I subsequently lost my religiosity and began to internalize and ruminate about these dark thoughts for months. My perception of the world vastly changed and every thing seems to have a dark tone to it. It was a very distressing psychological time and I should have got help sooner. My concerns begin about 1 month ago where one moment I felt emotion and then the next moment felt nothing. Anhedonia, avolition, apathy and numbness now permeate my life. I feel nothing from running, have no euphoria when drinking just the shitty side effects, ejaculatory anhedonia, social anhedonia, loss of interest in food, no euphoria attached to anticipation and no longer give a shit about becoming a doctor. I have to put inflection in my voice otherwise it is flat. Something is off with my brain and it is literal fucking hell. I feel like now i see things out of my periphery and see flashes of light (just had an eye exam recently which was normal). Last night I was stressed out and swore I heard mumbles even which led to this post today. I do not suffer from any paranoia or delusions and I am able to maintain hygiene and force my self into social events even though I get nothing from it. I am going to request to start an SSRI from my GP next week and begin learning CBT as this is not getting any better. So is this just depression or something worse?

Thanks for your input ahead of time.

MIKE had struggled with depression his whole life, but one day in 1995 it all got too much. “I completely fell apart,” he says. “I backed out of life.”

Mike tried to kill himself with an overdose of prescription painkillers. Medics saved him, but the next 15 years of treatment brought little respite. He cycled through dozens of types of antidepressants, with side effects including sickness, insomnia and anxiety. Nothing worked.

Then, in 2010, Mike received a call from his doctor, offering him the chance to take part in a clinical trial. Rather than targeting brain chemistry, as most standard antidepressants do, this was a trial of a drug normally reserved for Crohn’s disease, an inflammatory bowel condition where the body’s immune system attacks the gut. Desperate for a break, he signed up. And it worked. About a week after the first treatment, the fog of depression cleared. “I just sort of woke up,” Mike says.
