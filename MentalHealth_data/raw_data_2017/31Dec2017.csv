1,"What if the pain is just too much, despite all effort one has brought to recover, the mind doesnt let you recover and destructive thought patterns and beliefs are just too deeply embedded? 

How do we know, maybe it is just supposed to happen? Maybe that's what destiny decided for me.

We dont know anything, we think we know, but that is a belief and therefore a thought which is an illusion.",31Dec2017,3
2,"I've been dealing with my mental health since high school, now i'm 23. I was thought to have either BPD, or bipolar, but never got a diagnosis. Have tried therapy but it didn't work. Now i'm trying meds. My psychiatrist prescribed me lexapro and xanax. I felt dizzy and nauseous at first, but then it was gone. It feels good for a few days after that, but now i'm on day 11 and i feel VERY irritable, have a bit trouble sleeping, and a bit nauseous again. I can feel the xanax doesn't feel as good as before too. 


My pdoc is taking his day off bcs of new year, and i got a family vacation on early Jan. So i'm not able to see him anytime soon. Is this normal? I need advice, please.",31Dec2017,1
3,"It seems like anyone who dislikes life, is unhappy, or otherwise behaviorially depressed is told that they have  a mental health issue but I just dont agree.

When someone's life sucks, and they feel bad about it or depressed or otherwise are reacting in a way in line with reality, how is that a mental issue? 

If you're broke, ugly, hit with bad luck all the time isnt it natural to be depressed about it? That's not a mental health issue",31Dec2017,0
4,"My mother has been married and divorced four times in her life. My sister and I have different dads. All the men my mom married were severely dysfunctional in some way. As I've gotten older, I've realized how not so good our family situation was. My sister is a lot older than I am and I often saw how she acted out as a kid due to her father not being present for her. Luckily for me, my mom did not divorce my dad till I was 17. However, I still suffered with some issues such as anxiety and confusion about what it means to be a good husband and wife. She would often tell me as an 8 year old that she regretted getting married and that I should never get married. My mom often used my sister as an example of a ""bad kid"" and how I shouldn't act that way. I now have realized she acted the way she did because of the dysfunction of not having a stable family. My mother and sister do not get along, with my sister mainly acting very angry and cold towards my mother. She even excluded her from her wedding. I always thought this was wrong, but now I have started to feel this way towards her. I grew up thinking these men had done my mother wrong, but have learned she kept choosing to bring them into her life and she had done wrong to us. I feel it is her fault because she did not stop to think maybe she was the problem instead of the men. It all seems very reckless and even disgusting to me. It makes me boiling mad to think about it and I often bring up statistics on single motherhood just to make her feel guilty. She also goes back and forth on how she feels about being single, admitting she does get lonely and moans about how her married neighbors have husbands doing stuff around the house. But, then she'll try to make herself feel better and say how most families are screwed up and too many people stay in marriages they don't like. I find myself uncomfortable around families that are intact and have an active, available father. I'm really upset that I grew up thinking it was normal for a dad to be gone for days on end and for parents to sleep in separate rooms because they hate each other. I have adopted very conservative views on family and marriage and I always try to rub it in her face. I feel what I'm doing is bad, but I can't stop. I'm starting to behave worse than my sister. I don't know if it something my mother is doing that has caused us to be this way or if it's a coping mechanism for me. I'm not sure what to do about it. ",31Dec2017,2
5,"I'm a gay trans man who lost my husband on December 18. I have diagnosed PTSD and panic disorder but, for a variety of health reasons, am not a great candidate for many medications. (Although I do have some hilarious stories about many standard meds and their side effects.)

I have been suicidal before. I have, quite seriously, never been this badly off. I am also backed into a corner without resources. I've been trying to get LGBT-competent therapy but no one in my city can take me for 3 months. In order to access state-run health care, my options are ... well, they're both sex segregated apparently and for me, that would mean being on a women's ward which is not going to help me. I feel very effectively barred from accessing health services right now.

Even the grief support systems I've found assume, automatically, that I am a woman because I lost my husband. Even with a man's name and a picture of me and my husband standing together with beards and matching tweed jackets. As a trans man, this is deeply, deeply violative. As a gay man, this is also deeply deeply problematic. Combining the two is... an issue.

I've tried calling suicide hotlines. Last night, a woman told me to find Jesus. When I called back, the next woman told me that I will start dating again soon and find love again. (I lost my husband TWELVE days ago you fucking asshole.)

But I am also sitting on a pile of blankets between two suicide methods holding my husband's stuffed bear. To my left is a bowl of pills, carefully counted to make sure the milligrams guarantee an OD, and to my left, if I could figure out the mechanics, is an option to go to sleep and not wake up. It's not a good place.

I'm in the US, where our mental health care is a TERRIBLE system. I've tried crisis chat (and talked to the same person literally four times today). I'm leery of the suicide hotlines. I am terrified right now of even leaving the room I'm in, much less walking in the night to a hospital. 

I suppose this is a cry for help? I'm sorry if its inappropriate.",31Dec2017,4
6,"Looking at the past year, my mental health has gone down. There is nothing that I can pinpoint as the cause, but things are different from this time last year. I have a job that I like (for the most part), even though it's crazy and not what I fully expected, but I'm doing a good job. I have a loving wife, and a kitty (slightly worried about his health, but the vet said he was ok). I do have medical bills due to having some issues and that is giving me some stress, but none of it explains why I am feeling down and not happy. I feel like all my accomplishments are for nothing. I make 39k a year, but with bills and student loans, it doesn't end up being much.

Since around August, I've been thinking about death. Not suicidal thoughts, but that I don't want to die or anyone that I care about. I don't want my world to collapse after all the work I've done to get where I'm at, but I don't know how to change this thought pattern. Usually this feeling lasts maybe a week, but I've been thinking about death ever since August. I know I need to be thinking more positively, it's just hard. Maybe just getting this off my chest will help. I don't want it to continue anymore and I don't know what to do. I'm realizing that it is starting to affect my daily life and I don't enjoy things or relax as much as I used to. Today was just me sitting on the couch under some blankets and occasionally crying. I don't know why I'm doing this...",31Dec2017,3
8,"Cannot fucking get it out of my head. It's 3am and all I can think about is how nothing matters because I'm gonna be dead one day! Doesn't matter at all because when I stop existing I won't have memories to look back on! Literally nothing matters! Doesn't even matter if I try and make the best of things because one day I just WONT EXIST! NONE OF IT MATTEEEEERRRRRSSSSS! The impact I make on the world doesn't matter because I won't be around to see it. Time might end completely when I die and I cannot control it. It's like a tiny person is marching around my brain, banging pots and pans together and screaming 'ITS ALL POINTLESS! THIS IS TERRIBLE!'",31Dec2017,5
9,"I have these ‘tics’ or ‘compulsions’ of sorts. For example: I’ll be holding a pen but randomly get the urge to rub on the top left of it until I feel satisfied. As of right now, I’m holding my phone and have the urge to rub/feel on the bottom inside left of it but more inside the crack between the phone and phone case. That’s my most frequent one, as well as having the urge to constantly flick the light switch back and forth and constantly turn the doorknob. I’m also very ‘depressed’ in a sense. Sometimes I’ll feel happy, others sad, or just nothing at all. I hate my life, but unfortunately there’s more. I randomly get scared or anxious as if someone or something’s coming. It gets so bad to the point where I have this random rush of anger. My adrenaline pumps. I guess I could describe it as an unreasoned fight or flight sensation, with the feeling of being hung off a cliff. I mentioned anger, and that’s where it gets worse. I get frustrated easily by the simplest things. I could drop a pen and I’ll need to punch a wall or get into an altercation with my mother and want to beat in every bone on her body with my bare hands (I’ve argued with her today and had this feeling. That is why I’m here). I don’t think I’m very sane. I fantasize about horrible things (as stated above in regards to my mother). I’d fantasize about hurting people, killing people, and/or emotionally breaking them. When I think about it, my heart races with pleasure. As I’m typing I’m thinking of this, and I have this sense of arousal. The thought of being in control, having people do what you say is amusing. I’m also very emotionally unstable. I would laugh one minute then cry the next. For example: Today after the argument with my mother, I felt a rush of anger. If I didn’t control myself, I would have hurt her. But then I started to cry. Not because I regretted almost hurting her (even though I do), but because, I don’t know. Although I was crying, I still wanted to hurt her. I believe I was overwhelmed with anger. I fantasize A LOT. About a better life, being rich, famous, in various relationships, being a murderer, feeling the life leave one’s body after I’ve strangeled/beat them with my bare hands. If I were to hurt someone, I’d prefer using my hands. I’m very anti-social. I cannot stand being around people. Sometimes it’s because of anxiety, others because I find them annoying and worthless to me. I should also state that I love my mother, as well as a selection of family members. I feel almost every emotion, but sometimes I don’t. Sometimes I laugh when someone is extremely hurt, crying for help. Although I cannot remember the last time I was in that kind of situation, so I cannot measure. I’ve tried looking my symptoms up but nothing’s come up. Well, EVERYTHING’S come up ranging from sociopathy, to OCD or OCPD. If anyone could help, I’d be grateful. EDIT: I’m a 16 year old female and I don’t always have those negative thoughts. Mainly when I’m by myself. I often pace in circles and say my thoughts out loud because they can be overwhelming. I have more tics such as repeating certain words for the feel, predominately the letter ‘r’.  I also tend to avoid emotional situations. If someone were to cry I’d get up and leave the room. If someone’s family died I’d try my best to avoid that person. But what’s weird is I don’t mind it in movies/tv shows. Please don’t tell me to see a doctor. If I could, I would’ve done that by now. The best I could do at the moment is consult with doctors, phycologists, or simply experts online. EDIT 2: I should note that I’m very unfocused. I can’t get through the first few lines of a book without getting angry and/or stopping. Idk if I’m just being lazy but the feeling is intense. I guess frustrated would be the better term. I also get very frustrated when people are talking when I’m trying to think. Makes me want to beat the sh*t out of them, honestly. It’s not even that I’m frustrated, I just can’t think when people are making noise. It could be the smallest noise, a whisper, and I’ll get extremely frustrated or angry and want to shut them up. Now this happens all the time, especially in school. I’m extremely- well I’d say I’m above average in regards to intellectual ability for my age. Some of my family members call me a genius, but I believe that’s an over exaggeration. They’re all simpleminded idiots which is why I haven’t told them any of this, and I don’t plan to any time soon.

10,"I'd really like some input from anyone who cares to listen.  I've always been a resilient son of a bitch, despite coming from an abusive household.  In 2008, I got plantar fasciitis, and then the fascia ripped off of my heel and my metatarsals fractured in several places.  I did all the physical therapy, wore extreme orthotics to the point where I could only wear giant tennis shoes, but never felt better.  I then turned to pilates/barre class and yoga, yet still never found relief.  Since then, the pain has spread up my body, only on the right side.  Over the next 8 years, every time I see a doctor they send me to physical therapy and it never helps.  I'm in constant pain, but no one believes there is anything wrong with me; that I could fix it if I wanted to; that I'm experiencing emotional pain. Then my mental health started declining.  This year, the job I've loved for the first 4 years I was there, has completely ruined me.  My boss called me a crazy liar when I tried to ask him to stop arguing about how I feel about something... In front of my supervisor.  Neither of them thought this was a big deal, and despite trying to stay strong and professional, I've completely broke down.  Uncontrollable emotions and crying in the workplace and feeling like I always have to defend myself.  I ended up having to get FMLA just to protect myself, even though I think this is all a result of being treated poorly.  My manager even made me apologize to every coworker for crying all the time and explain to them that I have a mental disorder, and that I can take criticism from them.  I've been on all the psychiatric medications offered, tried acupuncture and ayurvedic medicine, therapy on multiple occassions, neurologist, orthopedist, podiatrist, rheumatologist, special diets, more yoga (which makes me hurt more), more meditation, journaling, baths, you name it.  Now my psychiatrist wants me to go on short term disability for 5 weeks and do an intensive outpatient therapy to learn coping skills.  I really feel like I've been gaslighted this whole time.  People tell me that I'm just perceiving things wrong, and that I must rely on others perceptions for the truth.  A year ago I was smart, highly respected, and a strong leader, despite being in constant pain.  Given that I'm only declining in health, I really don't know where to turn.  It seems that everything I try, someone ends up telling me I should be doing something else.  What the fuck am I supposed to do? If I could live alone out in the woods or a big ranch, I think I'd be fine, but I don't know how I'd make money.  Any input is greatly appreciated, and thank you for listening to my long and possibly confusing rambling.

12,"I've always known there was something wrong with the way I reacted to not being perfect, but yesterday was the last straw. I was outlining a doodle in my journal with a marker when my hand slipped.

I completely lost it. My throat went dry and I started sobbing. I had no reason for feeling and reacting the way I did, but I felt devastated.

My journal is a mess anyways because I've torn out so many pages. My handwriting is either never good enough or my sentences need to be revised. I only write to-do lists in it now because I gave up on my talent for writing long ago. It caused me so much stress to constantly see edits, but to never make progress in continuing my plot lines.

This is so extreme, and I am so ashamed of this part of myself. I don't even know what I hope to accomplish by posting this. I guess I just needed to finally admit that I'm not okay.",31Dec2017,4
14,"I'll do a TL;DR now, cause I don't know what I'm going to write yet and it could be messy or just jumbled. So, **TL;DR:** Saw my mothers bf have a bit of an outburst while drunk including violence and threat of suicide, and I'm experiencing pretty frequent re-runs in my head of parts of it.

My mum and I drove 14 hours on Friday after a family holiday that both our partners couldn't attend due to work. When we got to her house, her bf wasn't there and was obviously at the pub gambling. He has a severe gambling addiction and has hundreds of thousands in debt he had added to their mortgage. A few days earlier he'd promised change - ""new year, all honesty"" - so my mum was really disappointed, sad, and angry. They've been together 9 years, he's had a problem the whole time and his his debts most of it. She started finding out, and stopped being able to trust him with money, a few years ago. He'd do things like spend an entire weeks wage in one afternoon; borrow large amounts from friends and families with false reasons; get countless bank loans and dodgy loans, etc etc. Anyway.


So, mum was sad and pissed off. With his big promise to change that she believed, and mine and her talk few days earlier bout reaching out to gamblers help and getting things on track, she was just so disappointed that he hadn't kept his promise and had lied to her face, let alone further jeopardize their financial security and home.



He got home extremely drunk. At first he wasn't angry. But when she said she was disappointed he'd not cared to see if her 14 hr drive was safe, or been here to have dogs fed or dinner organised - he started getting mad. He started yelling he hated his job and was quitting, and basically only worked there for her and the house, and was done. No matter what she or I said, he was screaming now and repeating all of that. He threw a bottle of Pepsi across the room, kicked the couches, all the whole screaming at my mum about his job. He shoved her at one point and I stepped between them and told him not to hit her. He said he wouldn't, but he was so drunk and angry and gone, I didn't trust him. Mum got angry back, which she now knows didn't help but at the time I guess didn't think clearly either. He picked up a glass butter dish and smashed it forcefully, glass flew all over the house and I grabbed mums hand and made her come outside. We were both shaking, I remember noticing I was trembling a lot in my legs and hands.

I wanted us to leave but she insisted he'd never done anything like this before, and would pass out soon. She wanted to go sleep in my guest room with me and for us to leave in the morning. While he was sobbing loudly in the living room, we snuck into the guest room. He came in after a few minutes and made comments about killing himself. When he left the room I called the suicide hotline because I didn't know what would happen if I called the police and I guess I just didn't know what to do. After that phone call he came in again and said he needs to go to a mental asylum, and wanted to kill himself, and said he didn't want to hurt us, in a voice that made me terrified for all of us. I asked mum to take him out the front carefully while I called an ambulance as advised by the suicide hotline. 

While on the phone to the ambulance people, he walked into the kitchen, grabbed a knife that I hadn't noticed had been sticking out of the countertop which he slammed there earlier, and he put it to his throat. Still holding the phone without thinking I ran over and put my hand on his hand that was holding the knife and starting talking him out of it, asking him to not do it for me, not make me see that. My mum was standing kind of motionless, and I mouthed for her to pull his arm away. That didn't help n made him hold it closer. Eventually he let go, mum took him outside, I hid the knife and informed the ambulance person on ph what had happened. She hung up, n soon after police showed up, questioned him privately and my mum and I inside.


He was taken to the hospital - he wasn't physically injured -and my mum and I followed. After this its all I guess not relevant to mention. 


Since then I've had flashbacks where I see him yelling, and I see him holding the knife to his throat. It happens a few times throughout the day, maybe once or more an hour. It all happened only 2 nights ago, so I know that's normal. Yesterday I felt extremely tired and not hungry, just slept most of the day.


Today i feel hungry again. Made myself follow my normal routine, go grocery shopping, exercise, pick flowers. I feel way less immobilized by what happened. But I still, maybe once an hour or so, remember what my mum is going through trying to A, support her bf with his medical stuff he's going through, and B, knowing that one more gamble or one more drunkenness and she's leaving the relationship and her whole world will change. I know all I can do is all I can do. I am getting updates from her regularly. I'm being supportive, available, trying to say the right things. And I also know I need to, and she'd want me to, enjoy my moments and try to make my days normal and take care of myself.

I'm going to try to take care of me, as much as her, and remember that I can only do what I can do, and that time will be the most important and necessary thing here for us all.

I wonder how long I'll have these flashbacks for, and get randomly sad and feelings of guilt for my mums situation. I guess it'll get less constant each day? And I guess as her situation and future becomes clearer there'll be less for her and therefore me to worry over in that sense.

Yeah... I don't know if anyone will ever read all this. It was hard and weird to write it, I felt hot and stressed again. So I'm really sorry if anyone else felt that way reading it. I think it feels good just to write it where maybe someone has been through similar things and has come out the other side of the initial shock I might still be experiencing.",31Dec2017,6
16,"ok so I grew up in Bronx Nyc and I was painfully shy up until high school, where I started slowly making friends and having close relationships with people outside my family, which I never had before. Everyone at my school was pretty much the same, well off, from manhattan (the rich part of NYC), and had the same shopping habits/interests. Anyway, I felt out of place a lot of the time, so once in a while I would lie about things going on in my life (i.e. Where exactly I lived, what my family was like, etc.) these were things people couldn't really find this out because Nyc is so big and they were super detached from my culture and wouldn't ever go near my neighborhood. Eventually this lying became so engrained in me and I realized I had manufactured a whole life for myself. I kept my friends and family totally separate. Two different lives entirely with same basic elements I guess. I don't live in the neighborhood my friends think I do, I don't do all the things I say I do, I even lied about where I worked before to elevate myself. I lied about my middle name for some stupid reason even though it's on my ID. I guess I just wanted to be like my friends and my lying became so habitual it's pathological lying now. I became really popular being this fake person almost, I have tons of friends and they've never questioned any of it and they show me a lot of love. And I feel so bad. I don't lie about anything except my life at home. I just began college and I'm starting to think about the future. Idk why I lied or did it so freely these past few years but as I began to think about what is to come (in terms of finding a life partner and having kids, etc) I know I can't live like this. If I tell everyone I was lying I'll be disowned; I know people will think I'm crazy--and I'll lose all my friends. I have no idea what to do right now but I want to do the right thing. I realized how much I fucked up to this point and I just wanted to see if anyone had any advice. Thank you.",31Dec2017,2
19,"So I'm a guy with an eating disorder and muscle dysmorphia. I have been struggling with this for close to 10 yrs. It started out as a desire to get in shape during my senior year in college and I recognized that I was severely overweight and I needed to do something about it. I hit the gym and I was using fat burners (Hydroxycut) I went from 220lbs to 130lbs in the span of a few months, which I now know was dangerous. During that time I would spend at least 1.5 hours a day at the gym, i cut back to drinking only water, no sugary foods, no fats, only organics, and etc. It was working. However, I had a lot of anxiety about it and I was constantly body checking and worrying about how I looked. I would monitor my food intake and if I over ate just a bit or had some time of drink that was high in calories, I was completely overwhelmed with guilt and racked with anxiety. I would go to the gym and lift more, increase me ""eating right"". I would get so frustrated with how I looked, I started punching myself in the face over and over. I was finally at a place where I was able to manage my weight. However, I became pretty worried about how it all looked. Sure, I was very muscular, but was I bulky like the guys in those magazines? I started lifting heavier weights and experimented with steroids. At one point I used for about a year ( I no longer do thank god). Before you know it, I was muscular, bulky, and I was 190lbs of pure muscle. Despite having the body I've always wanted, I was so unhappy. I was still focusing on my weight, body checking, monitoring my caloric intake, and going to the gym obsessively. Trust me, if there was and is a way for me to get to the gym, I'd get there. I knew that I likely had an eating disorder and have muscle dysmorphia. I did get help and was in therapy for a year and Im on medications that makes it manageable. I feel better and less anxious. I'm happier. I still have rough days and times, but I get through it. What I want to say is that as hard as it has been to live with mental illness, no matter how hard we struggle, we have to keep in mind that we will have better days and things will improve. We just need to be patient with ourselves, lean on our supports, and keep our chins up. How else can we look toward the light?

20,"Just looking for a little help and am in unfamiliar waters- basic rundown, my sister had some kind of mental breakdown a couple days ago. 

Besides some basic anxiety- she's never experienced something like this before. She has always been very put together, she's in her mid 20's. It started with an itch in her lower back, but there was no rash. She became very anxious and didn't slept for 5 days- then she started talking in circles, and experiencing memory loss and hallucinations, with very anxious and at times manic behavior. We thought if we could monitor her and get her to sleep she'd be alright but when we walked in on her calling the suicide hotline we decided to take her to the hospital.

They would not admit her at the hospital but we spoke to a Dr. that suggested a different facility that would admit her on a 5150 order- he said he would be her primary Dr. there and was suggested so we did that.

Now that Dr. just dropped out- and her primary Dr. is the in house Dr. at this facility- and this facility is a scary shithole. She is the ONLY female patient, the men there are filthy and are making comments like ""send us more women""- the orderlys just hang out and make NYE plans, not caring.

I want her OUT of this facility, but the Dr. who works there says if she's not recovered by the end of the third day they must keep her 14 more, there. 

Is there anything I can do to get her moved to a different facility? I've never dealt with anything like this before and don't know what to do. Any help is appreciated.",31Dec2017,1

23,"Hey everyone, I’m working on creating a therapy group with a martial arts component to draw in young offenders and high-needs teenage males. I currently counsel teens and young males who are incarcerated, have just gotten out of the hall and are on probation, and am working to keep them from getting locked up again. A lot of these kids have negative/hyper masculine traits traits like, lacking empathy (stealing, committing crimes without remorse etc), being prone to violence, never backing down, manipulating others emotionally/physically, etc, can benefit from a program that addresses these harmful male archetypes and replaces with a positive, “peaceful warrior” type of male identity.  I was wondering if anyone out there knows of a martial arts group that has a mental health focus, like healing depression, anxiety, substance abuse, trauma, toxic masculinity (suppressing of emotions and extreme self-reliance to the point where it harms yourself , degradation of women, prone to violence etc).  I’ve been connected to one other person who has a boxing group for survivors of human trafficking and another boxer/therapist who created a boxing group with a Domestic Violence component. Breathing/self-regulation, mindfulness, evasion/avoidance over confrontation (not getting into fights because someone called you out), were some of the things he shared.

Maybe I've been feeling it longer but I really don't remember cause I never really payed attention to myself when I was a little kid.  I can't concentrate on stuff for a long time. I could be having a conversation with a group of friends and sometimes ( a lot of times actually)  I just space out and start paying attention to my surroundings and then I'll snap out of it and go back to the conversation only to find my self lost and confused of what's being talked about. And I have even told myself to stop doing that and I will begin to lose interest. Unless I'm really engaging I'll tend to space out or do my own thing. A lot of times when I'm at my boyfriends, him and some of his friends/brothers will be sitting around the fire, and sometimes I'll join in and laugh with them but I'll find myself getting up a lot to get water or go to the bathroom just to get a break from there. In high school, sometimes I would also be sitting at lunch with my friends and then I would space out. They would ask if I'm okay and I would tell them I'm fine I just spaced out. But it was common for me. I'm 19 now and back then I never realized how much I spaced out. But as much as I lose concentration on something, I'm really good at school. I had almost all A's in high school. I was especially good at math. It might have been because with math, it's more of a visual learning experience. You have to do it yourself and see it to learn it. In history, my teacher just talked so I had a hard time paying attention to her or sometimes the words never really made sense to me. I'm not sure of you guys have experienced this. But sometimes, I can hear the words, but I can't perceive them. Like I don't understand what is being said. And this happens to me when I'm having a one on one conversation with someone and I'll just nod and agree if I don't understand what was being said.  So I'm not stupid. I know I'm not. I'm constantly told by my boyfriend that I'm dumb. He won't directly say it but he'll imply it. After talking to me hell saying things like "" are you with me? Or do I need to repeat myself again"" ""just making sure cause you don't comprehend things"" I'm smart but Im slow. I can understand things, but at  times it takes me twice as long to understand than the average person. It can be jokes, school related, or any subject. It frustrates me because I know I'm not stupid. And it makes me feel bad when I'm told I'm dumb. His dad will say things like are you a blonde and just dyed your hair black? Of  course he means no harm, but I laugh it off but when my boyfriend does it, it hurts me. Im also very clumsy. I'll drop things and I am very forgetful. Last time I dropped mine and his bottled  water. I said oops and picked them up and his respond  was ""I have a smart gf"" :( I will also find myself pacing. I pace lot especially when stressed. I'll think and pace around the house. I noticed that my sister paces too. She'll be listening to music and walk around the entire house. No facial expression. It's odd and I do the same thing to. I also daydream every single day. I day dream about everything. Me going out on a run on a beautiful mountain. What it would be like if I was a dancer, a singer, an Astro naught. It's fun sometimes  lol it's like a mini story about me. So I noticed that I tend to think a lot. I have lots of ideas and thoughts in my mind. Sometimes there's so much that it makes my head hurt. I also have a hard time sleeping with these racing thoughts. I also get bored of things. Because I stay up at night till 3 or 4 in the morning, I'll do a lot of things to entertain myself. I draw, then get bored. Start watching tv, get bored. Start dancing. I go to the gym sometimes to get rid of all my energy. I also like to try new things and often never really learn to be good at it. I got a ukulele about 8 months ago. I became uninterested in it about 2 months in. I started hoopla hooping and learning tricks and I also left that about 1 month ago. I also tend to misplace and lose everything. Especially my keys. Like ugh it's annoying!! And my life feels unorganized. All my school papers are everywhere. My clothes is everywhere. But everyone sees a mess, but ik where everything's at. So it's messy but it works for me. I'm just tired of all this. I want this to stop.  All this energy and ideas. Sometimes I get excited and start talking fast and all my words come out jumbled up. Or Ill misread things. Talking about reading, I usually skim through things because just sitting down and reading everything when I only need main idea is pointless to me. I mastered this skill so im really good at it and helps me out in college. I also am the biggest procrastinator ever. Seriously. I will wait to the last. Minute and have those awful days of just homework and projects. It's frustrating but I get my stuff done cause I care about my grades. Anyways, is Is this normal? Am I crazy or something? Can someone relate to me? Maybe it's just everyone and I'm over analyzing things. ",31Dec2017,7
27,"Hello all, I never post to reddit so please excuse any lapse in formatting or etiquette. I feel compelled to post today because I am freaking out at the moment.

I came home tonight from work, to find that my brother has developed some strange paranoia/delusions. Before tonight, my brother has shown no signs of paranoia or mental unrest. I'm going to try and summarize what he has told me so far.

 He tells me that there is a mafia out to get him. The mafia is made up of his high school friends, an ex-girlfriend from college, a boss, coworkers, my moms coworkers etc. They are drugging him with a truth serum in order to discredit a testimony from him(?), and that they have tortured him in the past. He believes now that the mafia is out to kill him. 

I don't believe his story, it is too far fetched. Interwoven within the above summary, he describes certain events/items as evidence. A certain car somewhere, a specific song on the radio. He claims he saw a man he recognized as mafia walk up to our house with intent, but was stopped when he saw my brother spotted him. Certain events being played out as dreamlike (truth serum), and that he is secretly being drugged. The list goes on to include torture, and threats.

I'm really scared, I don't know what to do. I told him that I needed to think about what he said, and that I would consider the possibility of it being true. I asked him to consider the possibility that he is being paranoid. He wants to check for car bombs in the morning, and I'm gonna help him. After that I need to do something to help him, but I don't know where to start.",31Dec2017,1
28,"I just want to preface this with I'm not overwhelmed to the point of inability or hindering my personal life, but I want to know if there is a name for this and how to help myself.

As a graphic designer, I want to be inspired by everything and anything. Every album, every movie, every tv show, video game, etc., I want to listen/play/watch it all and still have time for other things I want to do like spend time with SO and work. Problem is I have all these grand ideas and buy or acquire whatever it is I want to do, get overwhelmed by the choices, do maybe one thing for an hour, or just not do any of it at all. 

It's not that I can't choose, but it's more about knowing how long doing something will take and the inability to justify spending my time on that one thing. For example, I do this a lot with video games. Since I've entered the world of the 9-5 grind earlier this year, I don't have a lot of free time anymore. Well, I have several unfinished games and some I haven't even started yet and it's hard for me to choose because I know in order to really get into a game (or anything), I need to dedicate a few hours to it. What happens is I attempt to do something and just end up spending the next couple hours on youtube wasting time and doing nothing.

I find myself doing this a lot with Netflix and spending like two hours finding a lot of cool shit to watch, then by the time I'm done I don't wanna watch anything anymore because I wasted the time I wanted to use watching tv just browsing.

I know the easy thing to do is just stop being so crazy and just focus on one thing. Usually once I devote a little time into something, I usually do get into it and that makes me actually want to continue doing the thing next time until I finish it instead of trying to do five things at once.

31,"My mom is in her fifties and has been on medication for bipolar disorder for a very long time. Just a short while ago she had a severe manic episode that landed her in the hospital for a few days. I came home for Christmas and finally received all of the details.

According to my step dad she had been talking to dead friends as if they were present in the room, she spoke to strangers as if they were my cousin and I, and she began making a lot of startling claims about having psychic powers.

Now that I'm home I realize that she hasn't really gotten better. She's no longer manic, but she still believe all of it was real. She's refusing to accept that it was a manic episode. Instead she insists it was a ""spiritual awakening"" and has become obsessed with reading old prophecies and doing tarot readings.

I don't know how to talk to her. I don't know how to help her. She's on paid leave from work for six months (thank god), but I don't know if she'll ever return to her old self.

38,"Given that it is widely known that social isolation causes mental health problems such as Depression and that Depression causes further social isolation which eventually results in suicidality one would think that psychiatry would have some interest in preventing and mitigating/fixing social isolation but that's not what we see happening. Psychiatry essentially does nothing in that regard which begs the question: Why not? 

Am I the only person on the planet thinking it would be incredibly beneficial if psychiatry would properly address the issues of social isolation rather than ignoring it and why are they ignoring it despite all the evidence? Is it a money thing (as in it would provide cheaper help to people thus reducing mental health costs thus reducing income for mental hospitals, pharma companies and psychiatrists and other mental health professionals)? Is it fear of admitting that the current approach isn't as efficient as claimed which would shine a bad light on the involved (psychiatrists, pharma companies)? 

How could one convince the public to fund or re-direct funds into programs that address social isolation given that they are constantly being told by psychiatry that either drugs are the cure and/or that people with Depression are ""just ill"" for no external reason that could be addressed? Or am I also the only one who thinks that the majority of Depression cases are probably of social/environmental origin, rather than of endogenous origin?

42,"I manage depression, and have near-completely eliminated my anxiety. My post history will attest to both. 

Independent of improvements in my overall mood, I continue to struggle with strong envy and jealousy. I have structured my adult life around this remaining handicap. As an example, I no longer use social media such as Facebook because the excursions others post on such sites have a nasty habit of leaving me feeling down for days. For that same reason, I've withdrawn from all but a core group of friends.

My most recent run-in with crippling jealousy came when taking my son to a play date. The parents of his new friend have a net worth approximately 6x my own, a figure I arrived at by comparing home values and approximate salaries. Though those parents are roughly my age with many similar interests and lifestyle tastes to my own, the jealousy I feel towards their financial situation cripples my ability to interact with them.

In my country, the US, envy and jealousy are generally seen as character flaws rather than medical symptoms, and so finding resources beyond results returned by Google for a search of ""jealousy, depression"" can be challenging. My own extended family, quaintly religious, cannot offer any advice beyond a reminder that jealousy is a Catholic sin. When I brought the issue up with my former psychologist, he gave the recommendation of removing triggers (eg Facebook) from my life. Though this has plainly reduced my _quantity_ of jealous episodes, it has not reduced by _ability_ to fall into such an episode.

How have you dealt with jealousy and envy?",31Dec2017,7
43,"I will start first with saying, that some stuff I will say here might be not for every viewer and sensitive.

There is so much to say that I dont even know where to start. I guess I will just start as I had to start when I spoke to police about this (except I wont be providing names here). I was 10 years old when it first happened, I was a kid when he raped me first time and it did not stop until I was 16. After saying this I already want to quit typing and just leave. I am a guy and someone who suppose to be my step father raped me few times a week for 6 years of my life. I have repressed all of this for years and never noticed how it effected me. I am 23 now and struggling with all of it. Out of those 6 years I could only remember about 12 instances at the time I spoke to police almost a year ago, now I remember 56 instances and I do not see it stopping anytime soon. 

There won't be any structure to what I am saying, Ill be just writting on the wim here whatever comes to my mind and I dont even know what I am looking for here in first place. I have wasted all my school years, I was trouble and I can blame it on what happened as I loved learning before that, I used to love history, research it in my own time and from place that I come from which is very historical with plenty of old buildings, walls even some palaces it was great. I have recently came back to my home town before I was 10 after 13 years of not being here, I do not belong here, I am not the boy that was here back then being amazed by everything around me, he died long time ago. Now I am a 23 year old trash, I do not have any skills or passion for anything, luckily I did not get anyone pregnant, could not bare to ruin someone elses life. My main purpose now is to find purpose, I cannot think of a single thing I want to do in my life or enjoy. 

Last couple of months been rough, failed another school because of stress and flashbacks that where happening with opening the wound. Lost loads of my money on that school and moved away to another city when I did it so I would be away from him. Had a job at the same time as I studied, lost it because of not turning up. My girlfriend split up with me as she felt like a caretaker after my mental health dwindle and I dont blame her, she was the reason why I went to police as she been abused when she was a kid and Ive noticed how bad it effected her, and her knowing what happened to me and me having the power to do something about it was killing her. She couldnt even remember the person that did it to her. Once I talked to police on January 21st 2017 all the mental problems started, I went to doctor to get something for stress and talked to her about it and she gave me some sertraline. Soon after I had lost my job, had to give a video statement to police which made me talk about incidents in detail; made me remember a lot of things I did not want to remember and I had to be very specific in everything, no sugar coating, I thought I was fine as I did not feel anything when I was talking about it, until after 30 minutes when I have asked if I can have a break for a minute (those interviews are videos non stop, even on breaks) as I stood up and grabbed the door handle I collapsed and had a panic attack, I started crying, I couldn't control myself at all, it lasted about 15 minutes. After that they asked me if I can continue with the video evidence, I wanted to run away but I stayed I knew I wouldn't comeback if I left now and if I wanted for him to pay for destroying my life I had to go through with it. Stayed there for another hour giving more instances which a lot of them I only remembered at the time, it was harder after it as I did not feel the emotional detachment anymore, everyword felt like a thousand cuts, I don't know if I remembered more or not by the time we finished it, now I remember more and offered to record more but if they find enough of evidence I want to speak infront of jury and him, which will be the hardest. This was around April.

After that I stayed at my school dorm, jumping from doctor to doctor, speaking to organisations that might help me get over this, I knew I was not normal and I could not keep it inside much more. Over few months I went to 200mg of sertraline, I do not know if it was helping me or not anymore, I had a lot of suicidal thoughts, talking to myself telling myself to hurt myself, I felt relieve when I saw blood from my cuts, it calmed me down. I always thought self harm was stupid and pointless, it was quite amusing to myself when I started doing it, I also knew it did not help but I didnt know what else to do. At some point it got hard to hide the cuts as I was a gymnastic's athlete so I changed to burning, burn my self with a lighter to feel some pain, but it wasn't as good as seeing blood. One day, when I was in my room I started cutting myself, I dont remember much from then and only thing I remember was messanaging my housemate and asking her to come to my room. She told me I was standing and laughting while cutting myself with a bland knife. She took me to hospital that evening and stayed with me whole night until next morning where a mental health doctor came to see me and had a chat with  me for an hour or so. I did not want to die or piticully enjoyed selfharm as I thought its stupid, he couldn't help me much but told me if I feel like Im in danger of myself at any point I can come to hospital and spend the night and they will make sure I won't do anything stupid again. Soon enough my house mates went back home, as the school year ended, I failed the year as I did not do my written work, it was quite an international house, I lived with 3 girls, one from Mexico, one from Japan and one from Chile. They all went off to their countries back to  their families, worried about me, which is probably why I did tried so hard to fight as they felt like family to me, I guess thats what 2 years of living together and breathing each other's farts does. I do not trust my family, I dont blame them at least not conciously or im trying not to. My mother couldnt know who he was, I hid it, I was tired of being poor, as we lived in a ghetto pretty much before moving to this country with him. Its hard being a single mother with 2 kids, I thought of it as my fight. Turned out to be stupid, she did it for me and my sister but my sister stayed with our grandparents and I failed my education. She knows now, as when police brought him for questioning they told her. I just seem to fail to connect to anyone in my family, I feel selfish when I think it was their responsibility to protect me from those things, I dont even know if its a fair thing to think or not, its been hard for my mother I cant blame her but I do, I think i do, I dont really know anymore. 

Once they left I stayed a bit longer and then I had to leave, I couldn't go back to live with my mother and she was still living with him at that moment as they both own the house and they couldnt put him under arrest as its a historical case. So I ended up on street, first couch surfing from friend to friend, soon enough I slept a bit on street telling everyone I was couch surfing so they dont worry or see me at my lowest. After that I found out about a charity that has a list of people who help young people by allowing them stay over night from day to day basis, I wanted to try to get myself back on feet. Found a job in 2 day by walking place to place as a chef in a japanese restaurant. I was always cooking, and enjoyed it, stayed working there for about 2 weeks, my plan was to wait for my first paycheck and rent out my own place and go from there. Each day I came back and cut myself, it was the only way I could cope with the stress of being homeless, working in the kitchen and everything else, it was too much. Ended up in hospital, taken there by my manager at work. After that I left my job, he was worried about me and told me I could come back when I want to. One thing I had was determination to get better which I lack and scared of now that it might end up like before.

 I used the money from half of my paycheck to buy a plane ticket and see my grandparents and sister, they ofcourse let me stay for free, my mother just told them Im depressed didnt tell them why or anything and now Im here since September, not doing anything, I gained weight, I feel weak, stopped taking sertraline as it felt like it only makes me feel nothing rather than get better. I think Im coming back to England in about month or two, Ill probably ask my mother if she could pay a months rent for me so I could start with less stress and get on my feet, work again, hoping it will be different this time that i wont have to worry about place to stay. Also there I can get help from my doctor and therapists as I just cant do it in my native language it doesnt feel right anymore.

I will try to get my old job back and I will probably get it but as a part time at start and increase it over time, probably as kitchen porter instead of chef. I just don't know what I want to do with the rest of my life, it feels like I should die everyday, I see shadows around me and feel like someone is watching me. I get flashbacks and nightmares daily for almost a year. Im scared of sleeping so I wont get nightmares. I think one therapist said I got PTSD. I wish I could help people like me, I think there is more that have been abused as children and never reported it. I am thinking of going public when and if my trail starts, even if it helps one person it would bring some meaning to my life. Maybe it will make a teacher ask a student if everything okay when they see they are doing badly, maybe a friend will ask another friend or notice something, thats what I always wanted, I wanted someone to notice but no one ever did. If I did something about it when I was younger maybe Id be on a univercity studying something, now it feels like an impossible task, I have not even finished my A levels so I cannot even go to univercity. Maybe one of you are in similar situation and need an extra push to face it, but this is part of my story, hope it helps someone.",31Dec2017,8

I’m pretty sure I have emotional issues or something, since a lot of times after these awful incidents I just want to kill myself. I mean I feel like I deserve it. Objectively, the things I have done were very shitty of me to do (I don’t want to go into detail about it however...)

I have contemplated it a lot, just thinking huh maybe I should just get the rope from downstairs and hang it on a hook and place my head through it and end my life. And I’ve tried to cut myself, but I was too fearful of the pain. I just hate myself a ton, not only for the things I do but since I’m not improving at all.

But I’m a teenager and whenever I tell my parents this, due to our language barrier they either don’t seem to understand or they say its puberty. Once I did get through to my mother, and she was very comforting and saddened that I had ever contemplated death. Then the next day she yelled at me saying I was emotionally manipulating her.

Anyway, my parents also won’t take me to a psychologist because they don’t see the point of medication (“they just want money”), and also believe I am being melodramatic ( which I often am, but I am very serious about my mental health ).

Then when I go back to them and try to explain that I really think the reason the medication isn't helping is that the symptoms aren't being caused by a mental health disorder, they say that it's just not the right prescription/dose for me and give me something else. At this point, I've been on just about every antidepressant, anxiety medication, and ADHD medication under the sun.

So anyway, I've been under enormous stress the past few weeks. After feeling vaguely ""on edge"" for a few days, I had a bonafide panic attack last night, complete with hyperventilating, sobbing, and clutching my phone debating whether to call 911 because I felt like I could pass out at any moment. I found an old bottle of expired Klonapin, took one out of desperation, and lo and behold, within an hour, I felt so much more clearheaded and better able to cope with everything. I woke up today feeling myself for the first time in almost a week.

I guess all of this is to say these medications really are useful, but I think doctors can do a disservice to psychiatric medications when they make people feel cynical about them by prescribing them as a cure-all they were never intended to be.",31Dec2017,3
60,"I’m aware I’m totally fucked up but there is a sub called Watch People Die that has a LOT of subscribers, so it’s not just me that is sick, if that is what I am. 

I have Personality Disorder.

I totally fantasise about killing people &amp; I recently got charged &amp; sentenced for threats to kill. Luckily (for me) I’m still free for now.

The crazy thing is I have TOLD my mental health team this over &amp; over. They know all about it. I saw a psychiatrist who knows me well on Friday and he said he thinks I’m fully capable of acting out these fantasies.

So why aren’t they stopping me???!!! Why am I not being locked up?!

EDIT: I need help, I know. Mental health services aren’t listening to me. Even people like myself who appear to be detestable to a lot of people, even within a mental health sub, do want and deserve  help, surely.",31Dec2017,0
62,Is it a bad idea to take Ritalin or an antipsychotic like Olanzapine. Don’t they work on blocking reputable of dopamine. I mean what if there is no dopamine in the first place. ,31Dec2017,1
63,"I need advice on how to approach someone who has depression and similar health issues. I've never been officially diagnosed with any disorder but I know I have something. Mental disorders are a myth in my family, its just something that everyone doesnt believe in, although Im sure our line is riddled with a few problems. 
My parents are separated and my mom is taking it really hard. She claims the love was gone and never existed but clearly its still there. Its been 3 years and nothing has improved. She went to a class reunion last year and met up with an old boyfriend and both spent the evening enjoying each others company and catching up with eachother. My mom wa the happiest she had ever been when she came home that night. Since then, she hasnt seen him again, the love they shared years ago was gone in his eyes. 
My mom isnt a super model or anything but in her younger days she was pretty and thin and popular! She was popular among the boys and I guess she liked the attention. As with most people, age has caught up to her she's still youthful looking, her skin is clear and smooth although her hair is graying and she's gained weight.  She stopped eating for a while to try to lose weight but luckily it didnt last that long although she still contines to skip many meals and follow a bunch of online health nut blogs with no scientific backing. She spends more than half of her income on makeup, creams and perfumes to try and doll herself back up. 
She's not used to being alone and she's really not taking it well. I'm kind of hurt though, she spent many hours trying to pin me against my father after the separation but I didnt take sides. I go back and forth all the time, spending equal amounts of time between them. I'm hurt because she claims we're best friends and that we will always have each other but I'm not enough of a companion for her. I understand friends and love are different but it still hurts. Even though we are family we are different. I'm not pretty at all. Ugly, fat, bullied all the time, always told I was useless and never amount to anything etc. I grew up this way so its what I'm used to. Imnot used to people other than my parents being nice to me. While I'm used to and fine with being alone and fully content with just friends and my mom's companionship, shes not used to that and I'm pretty sure she's fallen into a depression. ",31Dec2017,1
64,"I'm so sick of stupid antidepressants (or lack of). Getting on them was a nightmare, and getting off them is some other kind of hell. I'm sick of waking up sick, or dizzy, or out of it, or emotional af, or everything at once. I feel like I'm slowly dying.
I don't even know if I'm going to make it without them.",31Dec2017,3
