“My mind is a home I'm trapped in and it’s lonely inside this mansion” – Nf
I’m 22 years of old i’ve made this blog to help me get a further insight into the series of events that got me to the place i am today I suffer with my mental health just the same as many people do across the globe and my personal issues vary from Addiction to Bipolar and then general anxiety disorder.  I’ve recently started studying some psychology and through doing so it has inspired me to write this blog, so for the last 8 years or so i’ve been in a constant battle with my own thoughts, feelings and emotions, I have a really addictive personality and can sometimes come across as shy or anxious but correspondingly there are times that i’m over confident, cocky and impulsive which often leads me right into trouble but not only that it leaves me in a state of confusion and im sure it leaves others around me quiet baffled too, because in a way it’s like i’m two different people;  The version that’s an all out go-getter ready for any challenge kinda guy and then the person who locks himself away from everyone, destroys himself with self doubt and pushes all the good people out.  I have used many different substances and activities to self medicate since i was a teenage boy all in the bid to try escape the reality of my own head because of the anxiety/ fear of never being the best at anything and always chasing perfectionism when really it doesn’t exist has left me at the point i’m at now but i’ll get back to that later.

I used to worry and still do worry a lot about the most simple of things even when making ‘small talk’ at a checkout for example I would think thoroughly about what to say, when to say it and always be very self aware of my body language incase i did or said something ‘stupid’, Half the time if i could avoid social situations i would, even when i take a walk up to the shop i will put headphones on in the hope that no one will try stop me for that gruellingly awkward conversation that i’m not in any way shape or form prepared for.  The question is …what do you do when the whole world around you at least in western culture seems like they’re in competition with each other, when you feel like no matter how hard you work or how good you get at something the chance of being THE very best at anything is statistically very slim and unfortunately for someone who tries systematically to be perfect at everything living in a world where the competition is endless leaves me and many others i’m sure feeling pretty insignificant and full of anxiety.

This leads me back to the place i find myself in at the moment, where i have spent just over a decade of my relatively short life using such things as: Tramadol, Cannabis, Legal Highs, Ecstasy, Mushrooms, Anti-Depressants, Intense Exercise, Alcohol among many other things to mask my anxiety, to be able to socialize without worrying, to feel better about myself and basically to in a sense recreate myself through them.  Tramadol was the single most destructive pill i have ever came across, I remember taking it for the first time i must have been about 14 and my girlfriend at the time had been given them by her not so sane mother.  I remember a bunch of us taking  3 or 4 the first time thinking these are legal so hey, they must be fine right? .. I waited about 30 minutes until boom it hit me… all the fears I had, the anxiety and the insecurities felt like they had just wandered off out of my mind I felt free the freest I had ever felt, Little did I know the effects it would later have on me or that I would someday become heavily addicted to them, However that was the case and not only did i mess my education up through using them in School which resulted in expulsion before I even got my standard grades ( I did stop taking them after this happened) But became dependant on them years later following a breakup with the very person who introduced me to them in the first place the difference now of course is we that we had a little girl together, we had moved across here from Shetland to be closer to my Family and by this point I already had a heavy addiction to cigarettes and cannabis, what was i to do? who was I to turn to? and how could I be me again without the use of such substances? well that is a question I'm still trying to figure out the answer to after having spent almost 2 years taking the Tramadols everyday (stealing them might i add) until at one point i was swallowing 10 at a time just for them to give me that same effect so that I could go to work without feeling like i could have a never ending panic attack, or go out and meet new people without the intense feeling of worry since I was getting used to living in a new place and starting over again.  The problem is I took them so frequently with such high doses, it became my personality, I wasn’t influenced by the norms of society, religion or well anything aside drugs I formed a whole new version of myself through prescription meds or so I had thought, i never really spent much time worrying or analysing situations when i was taking the ‘devil’s’ pill so to that end I never really thought about what would happen if i couldn’t get them anymore, Who would i be without the little magic pill that helped me function?  The truth is once i did take myself off them i spent days on end with the worlds worst withdrawals, i couldn’t eat, sleep… I didn’t wanna go out or speak to people at all i just felt totally helpless but worst of all i didn’t know who i even was anymore cause i had relied on them so much when i lost them i lost myself or the self i created through being on them at least and that was hard because i had started friendships under the influence of these meds and i kept thinking what if i can’t act or be ‘normal’ around these people anymore?  What if they notice i’m totally different now?

Still i carried on using cannabis but in comparison to the tramadol’s it doesn’t do half as much of a good job at keeping me like a seemingly thriving young man in fact i believe it does the opposite for me it makes me feel more self aware, more paranoid and more anxious the same goes for energy drinks but again with any addiction or quick fix to a prolonged problem and despite knowing about how it makes me feel on a day to day basis it’s that one habit i can’t seem to kick even though the need for it isn’t half as bad as that of tramadols i still crave it every waking minute of the day.  I  really want to get myself off everything that's my main and only goal for the time being the only thing that holds me back so much is knowing that it’s not going to be as easy as just forgetting about it because after all it’s been a good 10 years of my brain getting used to having that joint at the end of the day, it’s going to be a far more intricate and long winded process to change the way my mind works in terms of me knowing that at some point i will have that joint to relax and I guess the only way to do that is to find myself some hobbies and start doing something else every time I feel like I want it thus the addiction is passed on to something else… Which begs the final question of this post will i ever really start a clean slate and be able to be me again without having something to subsidies who I really am?

10,"I recognize that mental health may not be the proper place for this post, but I feel horribly guilty over these things that happened years ago and it's in connection with more recent mental health flare-ups I've had so I thought I'd give it a shot. Thanks.

I'm 19 years old, about to start my second year of college. The fall of my freshman year of high school, I was babysitting for a family and after the kids went to sleep I masturbated. I was just bored, horny, and 14 years old. However years later, I'm thinking about it and it feels horribly inappropriate. I babysat for them a few times and I know one of the times, the kid (11 years old) came downstairs to tell me she missed her mom and was going to call her and tell her to come home. I don't know if I masturbated that particular night or not; I can't remember. But just the mere possibility that the kid walked in on me haunts me to this day, like I could have seriously messed her up or something. I still see her from time to time and she's very friendly; I just have no idea if it's something she saw or not. I feel so disgusted with myself for this and I can't get rid of the feeling that I did something unforgivable that night. I don't even specifically remember if she saw me or if I was just sitting on my phone when she came downstairs that night, which makes it worse because I'm just not sure. It didn't bother me then so much as it does now, because I didn't realize it was wrong to masturbate in someone else's house (especially while working a job) until years later. I also did it at another family's house but I'm a lot more certain nobody saw me there. Finally, later that same year (freshman year of HS) I masturbated in the parking lot of a busy golf course while waiting for my dad to finish playing. I had no ill intent; for anyone to see me or whatever, and I was only 14 or 15. I don't think anyone saw me there either, but who can be sure. It's not like at a grocery store when cars are constantly coming and going because most people go to a golf course for at least an hour or two. I remember at one point hearing voices of people and I think I probably paused or stopped then. But I still feel like a horrible person and a creep for doing that, like I committed a sexual offense or harassed/abused onlookers. I remember I was just looking at stories on my phone, I wasn't directing it at anybody in real life. These things seemed wrong to me only in hindsight, like about two years later.

Any input would be greatly appreciated on how serious these offenses were and what I should do about them, and if they seem to be indicative of mental health issues. Thank you.",07Aug2017,1,

Sorry if this is long and written weirdly. English isn't my strong suit. I've tried to shorten it up as much as I can. I've left out pretty much all the drama that has led up to many of my choices, so please don't judge. I am posting here because I need help and I'm looking for any advice I can get. 

So here it goes...
 
I often feel like I'm in a haze during the day. I don't feel normal and I don't like interacting with people. Rather than actually thinking about a person(s) or what they say, I'm busy tying to react in a way that doesn't make me look like an insensitive jerk or unintelligible. The only time I'm able to think clearly is at night, when I'm alone and able to process my thoughts. I'm consistently unmotivated and tired each day. I can't concentrate on anything and get bored easily. Anytime I go to school or try to learn anything, it feels like an impossible struggle. Even when it comes to topics I truly am interested in, I'm not motivated enough to really learn about them. Whenever I try to read I lose my concentration and my thoughts wonder onto other things. I hardly remember anything. It's fucking discouraging and I give up so quickly because I can't focus and nothing seems to stick. It makes me feel stupid and I feel trapped in this mindset. 

However, I do feel motivated and confident when I get high. I actually gain motivation and interest. Suddenly I'm more open-minded and attempt looking into topics I want to know more about. I even attempt studying despite my inability to concentrate. For once I can run with a single thought, get creative and come up with some really cool and coherent ideas, despite the fact my mind is in a altered state. 


Now I know what you might be thinking. I mentioned I get high, but I'm not an addict. I often use drugs as stress relief. I don't use every day and I'm certainly not dependent on them. It's often just a tool I use to help myself work shit out, de-stress, and reevaluate where I'm at mentally. I would likely be worse off without it. Let me explain what I mean: 

The first time I got high it was like I ""woke up"" for lack of a better term. I no longer felt like I was stuck in this haze, I began to have my own original thoughts and ideas. But when I'm not in an altered state of mind, I go back to a mindset that feels like I'm on autopilot. Don't get me wrong, my main state of mind isn't always horrible, but I find it helpful to get high and ""reboot"" my mind sometimes. I don't do it all the time, especially because I can't afford to, but it does help.



The real problem is I know getting high isn't a long term solution. It's not a proper way to motivate myself, it's irresponsible, and can cause a lot of problems in the future, especially if I intend on making something of myself. I just don't know what do. I can't seem to break this mental trap and I don't know how to fix this. Please help me.  ",07Aug2017,1,

14,"Basically, I'm 22 and I've been in the work force since 18. The amount of jobs I've had since I first started working is ridiculous. I start a job and then I get really anxious about going in one day and then just end up quitting. I've hated every job I have ever had. There were some aspects here and there that were okay, but each time I've just gotten so anxious that I ended up quitting because all I could think about was work and it was ruining my life. How do I escape this cycle? I don't want to be forever stuck in the loop of quitting jobs and getting new ones, but I also don't want to be stuck in jobs I hate anymore. Why am I like this? How do I stop it? I'm not lazy. I just don't know how to handle this situation.",07Aug2017,9,
15,"I'm a recent high school graduate, living in the United States. I've been holding out for things to improve for quite a long time, ever since I really crashed at the very beginning of puberty, though I don't know that I'll ever be 'cured.' It's something that just can't seem to compute with my depressed brain, even though I know to think of it as impossible can be a hindrance to recovery and progress. ""It gets better"" is something I can believe though; it's just a matter of wondering when.

Anyway. Hormones kicked in at age 9 for me, and I spiraled into deep depression that turned out to be bipolar disorder and my preexisting anxiety escalated until it was beyond crippling. It was a living hell. A nightmare which I'm very grateful to be better in control of now, though I'm far from healthy. 

I'm 18 now, and beginning to wonder if these things ever get more manageable. As time has gone on, I've mostly grown out of the social anxiety that crippled me in middle school, no longer self-harm, and am very good at recognizing my own dysfunctional thought patterns when my brain is doing something it shouldn't be. However, I am still regularly suicidal, have been medicated for five or six years now and suffer horrible side effects, still have anxiety that would be crippling if I wasn't so used to it (I just go on with daily life, even in the middle of a panic attack), and worst of all, can't write anymore. Writing was my hobby until I was put on medication that saved my life; I wrote an entire novel in the three months before my half-assed suicide attempt. I can't explain the correlation, but my inspiration always vanishes when I take medications. And sure enough, when I go off of them, it's back within weeks. I'm very grateful for the good medications have done for me, but it's killing me to not be able to write. Not to mention side effects. I'm very much tired of fighting and the constant nagging fear that my life will be one long list of medication side effects. I never expect to be 'cured,' but 'relatively healthy' is something I'd love to aim for and is one of the biggest hopes I have left. I want to be able to minimize the impact of my illnesses on my life and overall happiness, and manage their remaining effects.

This post is all over the place, but basically, I've had a horribly rough adolescence and I was wondering if anyone else grew to be able to better manage and recover from their mental illnesses. Any advice or encouragement would also be welcome.",07Aug2017,2,
16,"I'm really in need of some life saving advice, someone to relate to me, or someone to share their similar experience. I am 19 years old and I tried acid for the first time 2 days ago; I took 3 tabs. It was the most horrifying, traumatizing, and disturbing experience of my life. I'm afraid it brought some underlying mental health issues to the surface and I wish I could go back in time and never do it. It all hit me at once.. I no longer had free will or control over my actions.. I couldn't tell fantasy from reality.. I couldn't remember who I was supposed to be in this universe. I spent hours trying to think like my normal self in a world that made no sense, and that only frustrated me further to the point where I could no longer recall anything about my personality. And that loss of self identity was lasting for me.. I can no longer feel like my life has meaning. There is nothing that makes me special. There is nothing that makes me me. I am worthless and I may as well kill myself than feel this way. I cannot revert back to my normal way of thinking. I really hope I am not stuck this way forever. I have no confidence left, coming from a person who once had no confidence issues at all. I feel so socially awkward now that I cannot even spend time with my closest friends or family without it feeling forced and uncomfortable.  I lost myself, my personality, my sense of humor, my social skills, my happiness, and everything that gave me a reason to want to live. Someone please help me",07Aug2017,1,
17,"A short-term solution to a long-term problem is the way most former addicts describe narcotic addiction. When you go on SSRI’s the doctor tells you that eventually you will build tolerance and have to increase dosage. Eventually, the drug will lose it’s effect altogether. At this point they generally ween you off of it and onto a different drug. 

I could understand if the main objective were to do intensive counseling during the year or two someone is under the antidepressant’s influence, with the intention of gaining a new perspective and working through some issues; sort of kick-starting the process of personal growth. However, that’s not the way Fluoxetine was prescribed to me. Not nearly enough emphasis was put on counseling during my treatment. It was recommended, that was all. At the medical center I was going to they don’t even have enough counselors to do that properly. There’s a waiting list that takes months to get through and once you do, the appointments are bi-weekly at best.

My doctor was very nonchalant about prescribing my antidepressants. It was more like I was prescribing them for myself. I would just suggest to up the dosage and she would gladly do it without much deliberation. Each time I came in couldn’t have lasted more than 5-15 minutes. That’s how long she took to figure out what was going on in my life and with my mental state, and to explain to me what to expect with my new regimen. 

At first, I have to admit the Fluoxetine seemed to be working fantastic. It changed my whole mental state. I was brimming with confidence, I could think better, I felt more witty, and I was much more motivated. Stressful situations weren’t a problem for me during that time period at all. However, some serious side effects began to emerge and I don’t think our current healthcare system does enough to mitigate experiences like mine from occurring.

I gradually became more impulsive and my behavior became more risky. I started drinking more coffee and alcohol than I have ever been tempted to previously (I am normally very sensitive to caffeine). Now, I am aware that you’re not supposed to drink alcohol while on Fluoxetine but I also think impulsiveness was a symptom of the Fluoxetine and, whether or not you disagree with that, in practice there are a large percentage of people on antidepressants who drink alcohol while on them.

I hadn’t been seeing a counselor during this time and when I went to try and see one, they were very put off by my drinking. Now I can understand why that is from their perspective, but in all honesty, drinking has never been an issue like that with me- either before or after the SSRI’s. I have done some binge drinking on weekends in the past, but nothing like the way I got going when I was on SSRI’s. I even told my doctor that I was drinking too much and too often. She said stop and go see a counselor, but I couldn’t just stop at the time and the counselor didn’t want to see me *because* I was drinking. 

I am typically very sensitive to caffeine but for some reason the SSRI’s allowed me to drink 2-3 cups daily without any ill-effects. I have never been able to do that on a daily basis, either before or after I was on Fluoxetine. The coffee added more energy and motivation without the typical comedown I would experience later in the day.

Over time, though I was more confident, I also became more aggressive. One night at a party, I got into a fight with a very good friend of mine. We’d been friends since Kindergarten. The fight resulted in burning bridges between pretty much my entire circle of friends. I don’t want to go into detail of what happened but I guess I blacked out and just started swinging. I came to during the fight and I was brimming with rage. I got horribly beat up and I suppose I deserved it, having started the fight and all. It was like I didn’t really care though. Even after the fight, I didn’t really give a fuck. I was so mad that, in my mind, he had deserved it. The aftermath probably did more damage than the actual fight. In addition, I started arguing with my sister during this time period and got kicked out of the house I was renting. 

I spoke to my doctor about my anger issues rearing their ugly head and she just treated it like it was part of the therapeutic correction the drug was making to my brain, or perhaps she was attributing it to my drinking while ignoring any effect Fluoxetine might have had on my drinking. But it was now obvious that things were no longer moving in the right direction. After around 2 years of this pattern taking shape, I felt I had to insist to my doctor that I stop taking the SSRI’s. 

The Fluoxetine withdrawals were horrible. I was led to believe they wouldn’t be a big deal if I weened myself off very slow, which I definitely did. The withdrawals were a nightmare, lasted longer than I was told they should, and caused a lot of negativity within my family life.

I stopped drinking completely about 6 months after I was off of the Fluoxetine. Strangely enough, quitting drinking wasn’t really hard for me at all once I was off of the SSRI’s. I haven’t had a drink now in over 9 months and I don’t miss it at all.

This whole experience has made me shift my perspective towards our treatment of depression/anxiety here in the US. We just throw potentially dangerous drugs with crazy long withdrawal times at the problem. My doctor didn’t even really do much of a health check-up before hand. I did have a blood test to make sure my liver was healthy but I don’t even think she checked for little things like my hormone levels or vitamin deficiencies. Nowadays, there are even genetic tests they can run to make sure someone is on the best SSRI for that particular individual. Of course, that’s far too fancy for state healthcare insurance though! Instead they work there way down a list of antidepressants and see if you wig out or not. If there is a bad reaction to a particular drug or the withdrawals are hell, it’s on to the next one on the list. Meanwhile, there is often times substantial interpersonal damage occurring while that bad reaction unfolds.

Whether or not you agree that Fluoxetine played a role in my life spiraling out of control, I think it’s safe to say there should have been more clinical oversight during the course of this treatment. I happen to be very lucky to have such a good family that has let me stay with them while I put my life back together. Many others do not have this luxury and would be out on the street in the midst of a downward spiral into addiction.

Shouldn’t there be something akin to a survey taken by each individual treated upon completion of an antidepressant regimen to ensure there isn’t a statistical disconnect between projected results and actual results? Drug company’s have an obvious financial interest in pushing their product and I’m not convinced there isn’t some downright fraud going down with the makers of these drugs behind the scenes. 

I’ve come across a staggering number of people online that have had such a bad experience with antidepressants that they have completely lost confidence in our medical system’s approach towards depression/anxiety and are now beginning to explore more natural, adaptogenic solutions like: Fish Oil, Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Valerian Root, Bacopa, Lion’s Mane and Reishi Mushroom powder. The most obvious advantage being that the withdrawal periods are practically non-existent if they are cycled properly.

19,"i recently read an article about how Lena Dunham wrote about sexually abusing her little sister and it's been giving me anxiety ever since. I have a little sister, and when babysitting or something she would watch cartoons on my dads phone on one side of my parents bed (it was a queen size) and I would sometimes masturbate on the other side. Before you start judging me I didn't know this was possibly illegal or anything. I would make her move as far away as possible and often check back to make sure she wasn't paying attention. I'm getting so much anxiety even writing about this and I feel like a terrible person. I never touched her, I would NEVER DO THAT. I never abused her or even said anything around her that would be considered as ""provocative"". When I masturbated I would often try to make her go to the living room but she didn't wanna do it. I have intrusive thoughts ocd and if you have it then you know how it is, when you obsess over something so much. I actually feel suicidal about this. I do mastubate in my shared room but only when my sister (different one who is 12) is asleep me it's in my own bed. I never even realized that any of this was wrong and up until a couple years ago didn't even realize what I was doing is masturbating. I can't even imagine hurting my little sister like this and every time I think about it I wanna cry and have a borderline panic attack. Please help me what do I do? I wanna talk to my mom about this but we're from the middle east and she would freak out if she knew I knew what masturbating even was. And now the thought of my little sister finding out when she's older is in my mind and when it first came I started sobbing. What do I do?

22,"I don't usually do stuff like going on about my problems to strangers, but what better way to do it anonymously? 

I'm 23 years old and I have a personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder. You might have heard things about it, but it's very new to me. For years I knew I had some issues, but I was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder type 1. I saw a psychologist regularly and against my will at 19 when my life was spiraling out of control, and she told me she believed I was misdiagnosed and talked to me a little about BPD but said I was too young to formally change my diagnosis to that. Fast forward to recently, and after switching to a few different counselors and psychiatrists over the years, I have gone back to that old one and she documented my new diagnosis. 

I don't even know where to begin. I like to think I'm very educated in mental health, having been through all the different types of therapy and treatments and medication in my teenage and young adult life. But I know nothing about personality disorders. I know a lot about being bipolar, and I guess being told that my whole life, my brain was tricked into seeing the manic and depressive waves in myself. It scares me to not know my own self anymore. I've always struggled with my sense of self, not knowing who I truly am... but at least I always had the comfort of knowing what was mentally wrong with me. But after googling BPD and just reading the simple textbook symptoms, it already looked like it was explaining my entire life. It gave me explanations to my other weird quirks that couldn't be explained by bipolar disorder, such as obsessiveness, fear of abandonment and going through drastic and desperate measures to avoid being alone, self image and sense of self issues, selfishness and manipulative, and viewing the world in either black or white: good or bad, 0 or 100. I know they're all very vague terms that could apply to anyone, but all of these affect my life so majorly in every aspect that it was defeating me. I thought I had this weird, different case of bipolar. I felt like a black sheep. It puts you in a dark place when you think your brain is wired a different way and you just feel bat shit crazy all the time.. I feel a sliver better now knowing  I'm not alone and there's a lot of others who have the same issues as me.

I had a physically abusive dad growing up and this was the main core around my therapy.. I grew up feeling like my dad hated me, feeling like a burden. I struggled with self harm and suicidal thoughts. Because of these childhood issues, in combination with my disorder, I have a problem with relationships in my life. I can be violent at times, I've been in physical fights with old friends and resort to violence in bad fights with old boyfriends. My temper is all around really bad. Despite that, I am a nice and kind hearted person, and when I love someone and care about them I love with all my heart.. But I wear my heart on my sleeve, my emotional dysfunction makes me act out and get crazy at times. I have a hard time getting along with people because I feel like Jekyll and Hyde. Sometimes I'm having a good day and being funny and bubbly and cheerful, and the next day I'll be irritable and freak out on all my co-workers or family members or whoever for stupid things. And maybe the next day I feel really guilty and apologize profusely. I give people whiplash with my strange behaviors. Because of this, I lose a lot of friends and create wedges with family members. People come and go out of my life way too fast and dramatically; there's always a fallout. I used to blame other people, even knowing that I had some sort of mental disorder, but the last year it dawned on me that I'm the common problem. This has caused me to feel emotionally and physically alone all the time. Feeling like you have nobody sucks, but what's even worse is knowing you are the one who unintentionally drives everyone away. And the harder I try to repair these broken relationships, the more messier and worse it gets. It's like burning down all my bridges and trying to remake them out of ashes. 

But the hardest part to deal with is probably my love life. The lighter stuff first: casually dating and meeting anyone is next to impossible, because I'm too obsessive and get attached so fast. I want to jump into relationships immediately, which in my head I know is not smart or realistic usually. I get too obsessive with social media and checking and ""stalking"" to see if they're secretly dating or flirting with anyone else. I literally cannot help or control myself. Basically I have complete and total trust issues for no reason other than maybe guilt. Any relationship I've been in was a complete disaster and went down in flames. I'm always the ""psycho"" one, is what I'm called often.. and let me tell you, being called psycho and crazy is the most hurtful thing anyone can say to me because of how hard I struggle with my issues, and the people who call me those names have no idea of my diagnosis or what I struggle with. I've never broken up with anyone before, I always get dumped on my ass when the person I'm with can't take anymore of me. And I don't blame them. I don't think anyone deserves to put up with the baggage I come with. I have cheated on every person I've dated, and still feel immense guilt, especially to one in particular which I was going to marry. Neither he or anyone else I dated ever found out I'm a cheater, but it doesn't change the way I felt and still feel.. I loved him so much and he was good to me and treated me right. He accepted me as a mentally ill fuck up and chose to love me and support me anyways. But I literally can not help myself. I have no idea how to stay faithful even to the person I wanted to spend my life with. I'm not saying I would sleep with anyone and need to be in sex therapy, but it was just that I'm always obsessed with this game. I get obsessed with the sneakiness, the lying. It temporarily fulfills this empty feeling inside me called ""attention."" I always feel like I'm lacking attention, and I'm so vein and need to be ""wanted"" all the time. It's really sick. But this is how I've always been, and I don't know why I feel this way, but I do. I have 0 explanations other than I have so much guilt for ruining other people's relationships, and my own... This boyfriend I was talking about, we split a few months ago. And I can't help but think every day that if I could have just stayed faithful and focused on my mental health instead of being sneaky, I would still have him. He proposed to me shortly before we broke up, and I felt so guilty about cheating, that I told him no because we had issues we needed to work on before taking our relationship to the next step. When really, I was borrowing more time to mess around before settling down- how sick am I? To make it all worse, I reflected our constant, explosive fighting and my mood swings and depression on HIS ""anger issues."" And that was my reason to him why I couldn't be engaged just yet. So he started anger management counseling to work on our relationship, while I continued on with my games. Yes, I do believe he has some anger issues of his own but it's so minor; everyone has their flaws and skeletons in the closet. But this was manipulation to get what I wanted. Only I wasn't conscious of it at the time, I tricked myself into believing my own lies. I was being selfish and only looking out for myself. It's only now that I realize what I was doing. The trend is, after I'm dumped, I try so hard to fix the relationship. It takes over me, I become obsessed with trying to fix what I broke. And I've done some things I'm embarrassed to admit, such as write them emotional letters pouring my heart out, or be a bitch and intimidate a new girl they're talking to if I find out recently after the break up. And more...

All I have ever wanted, even during the time I was screwing around, is family. I don't want to be alone, I have no relationship with most of my family, and hardly close with my mom and sisters. I just want my own family where I can come home from work and feel wanted and loved. I grew up with parents who hated each other, and I want my future kids to see their parents happy and in love. I want my future kids to look up to their mom as a strong woman, not like mine who I watched be very weak and manipulated. I want to make them feel special and teach them the importance of family, which were lessons that I was never taught. When you grow up with horrible examples, you want different for your future family. But it all doesn't seem realistic. No matter how close I'll get to everything I've ever wanted, I'll always screw it up. It's almost like my subconscious will never allow me to be happy. That statement alone makes me feel crazy. 

I've never even explained this much of my life to a counselor in one sitting. You never know what demons people are battling behind closed doors, what invisible battles they're fighting with themselves. Even if someone is pretty, well educated, has a good job and looks like they're doing alright, doesn't mean they are. So I honestly believe my mental issues get overlooked and missed by people who are close to me, or even written off by mental health professionals. And that's perfectly fine by me, because I don't want to be treated any less than normal. Even if I don't feel normal. I'm fucking terrified of being alone, to the point where it makes me feel ill, and I know that's definitely not normal. I don't know how to be single. If I don't have anyone to hang out with and distract my mind, I come home and bawl all night and sometimes even take pills or other drugs to help with the pain, and I still hurt myself every now and then, although not nearly as bad as when I was in high school. I don't know what to do with myself. The depression and anxiety of it all is unmanageable. I have been in some pretty dark places and it just seems to get worse as time goes on… I wouldn't say that I'm actively planning to do anything really stupid, but each passing day I lose more trust in myself. 

What it all comes down to, what I am mainly searching for support with, is that I don't know if I can live the rest of my life as a living, breathing science experiment. I've found that psychiatrists love to experiment with drugs on their patients. Yes, that's technically what they do.  But I feel that all the antipsychotics I have been prescribed for bipolar disorder (which now I know is false) screwed me up even more. Those strong drugs all but tranquilize you, and that's not the answer to coping with your mental disorder. It doesn't teach you to cope with life. Who wants to live the rest of their life taking multiple pills every single day? And taking a huge risk of dealing with possible life threatening side effects by missing a dose, depending on how high milligrams you take? All to just keep your crazy emotions and other issues in check. Also, not being able to make and maintain healthy relationships in my life is very defeating. Feeling like you're going through it alone makes you not want to carry on. Feeling like you're never going to be truly happy; no one will ever love and accept you because of your mental disorder is... devastating. From the horrible things I've done, I wouldn't love or accept me. So how can I expect anyone else to?

24,"I am a musician, and I own/operate a small clothing line. I've dealt with my share of demons my entire life, and lately I've become so indifferent to my passions, and my hopes for a better life. I'm at a point where I won't even bother taking risks for the things I love. Instead, I just watch them fall apart and burn. 

I've been working on getting back into music for the past year or so, but over the past two months I've been so complacent. My clothing line is suffering from lack of motivation to keep up on social media, and my friendships are falling apart.

I'm not sure what to do to get back on track. As a musician I had a lot of opportunities, and loved every minute I was on stage. My clothing line gave me the chance to meet people from all of the country and hang out with bands I admired, and my biggest desire was to be debt free and slow life down a little for my passions.

29,"I'll try and keep this concise, but there's quite a bit to get across so sorry if it rambles. 

I don't really pay too much mind to diagnoses, but I can see their merit as neat descriptors for a set of symptoms. I should say though that I'm pretty clueless on a lot of mental health terminology, so please bear that in mind. That said, here's an overview of my condition.

Was diagnosed with PTSD when I was 11 or 12, 20+ years ago. 

Following that I became severely depressed and anxious, although I think there are some blurred lines here, as IMO the depression/anxiety could easily be interpreted as the hyper-vigilance of PTSD and resultant exhaustion of that.

Around 2003 I was put in touch with a service for young people with psychosis because I let it slip that I have auditory and visual hallucinations. 

Since then things have been up and down, with the last few years being unambiguously down. Everything in my life started falling apart and I didn't have the resources to keep it together. Sorry to use cliches but it's been like a house of cards; as soon as a couple go everything else comes tumbling down. I tried to take the coward's way out a few times but was unsuccessful. Things got very, very dark and very frightening. This is what I'm trying to come out of now, but it's like trying to turn around a huge ship going at full steam.

Any friends I had obviously got exasperated with me and fell away. A few were very angry and told me I was a disgrace and I don't really blame them. One (not particularly close) friend sent me an angry email ending our friendship and saying I should be sectioned, which I think about most days. I'm in touch with my family but it's extremely strained. I can't really go there for support because they're very dysfunctional and (believe it or not) worse than me. 

I had been using a community mental health service but to be honest this did more harm than good. Most of the meetings lasted less than ten minutes, quite often took place in a corridor with people coming and going, and I felt very overlooked and dismissed. Eg., I was on medication which raised my blood pressure and which made me feel like I was about to have a stroke (headache and pressure/buzzing in my head) whenever I got anxious. I was asking for a medication review for a good six months but never got one. When I started to feel suicidal (after the deaths of my biological dad and older brother - one was a suicide ironically enough) I told them but it was brushed off, and then my treatment was withdrawn, leaving me totally alone and unsupported. You can draw your own conclusions from this. 

So now I find myself in the position of having to go it pretty much alone. My GP is very good but obviously can't give the intensive, day-in-day-out care I need. I'm very reluctant to reconnect with the CMHT because I can't accept they have my best interests at heart. I know what will happen - they'll push me to go on medication (which I'm not currently taking BTW) and then discharge me, telling me to come back the next time I have a crisis. But each crisis is worse than the last and it's terrifying to think that there's a place lower than what I'm trying to escape now. So on balance I think I'm better off just relying on my own wits. Unfortunately I can't afford private help.

Things that have helped are meditation and religion. I know how that sounds, but I have to work with what I've got. Previous talking therapy and CBT I've had didn't really yield amazing results, but there are some things I've picked up, like making lists and breaking down tasks, but there's a limit to how much that can see me through. I've been trying to do all the right things (eating veggies, getting some exercise, thinking of things I'm grateful for etc) but these are quite small tools for the task I'm facing. 

I've wasted so much time and I can't face that dark place again. I'm just really tired of it all and I want to get better. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Every reply helps and is gratefully received.

Like it makes me feel like everything I do is worthless and the tough thing is like I think about dying all the time. Not like I want to die quite the opposite I want to live but all I can think about is dying and like that somehow makes everything in my life meaningless. Now I don't really feel depressed per se I suppose I feel perpetually afraid of dying or people I love dying. The worst part is these thoughts are so intrusive it's weighing on me very heavily.

This is really quite pathetic, i know, but for a very very very long time now i have been incapable of going more than two minutes without having to give in to IT. (IT is the name that we gave to OCD. My therapist always says that i have to see my OCD as being a separate being to me, as if i view it as being part of me, il never get rid of it). The medication can only do so much, and im above the maximum dose that is allowed for my weight. The only way i will get rid of it now is by doing it myself, which means resisting it. Because it gives me the compulsive thought that something awful will happen if I don’t do X, Y, or Z. So, I have to ignore it and try not to do it. If I don’t do it, il normally have a panic attack. I call it ‘IT’ because of my re occurring nightmares, and I imagine it as a bundle of camouflage coloured scribbles. Its camouflage coloured because no one can see that it is there, and it is made out of scribbles because it is a mess and it turns my brain into a mess of scribbles.IT tells me to touch things, and if I do, it feeds IT, and IT grows. If I don’t, it starves IT, and it will eventually die. If I can completely ignore it and not touch things, it will die, and this nightmare will be over. Today, (7/8/2017), I was at CAMHS, and I actually physically acted out ripping IT out of my brain, throwing it on the ground, and stamped on it. I shouted, I swore, and I killed IT. I then started a timer to record how long it has been since I have given in. I have given in a couple of times, but that doesn’t matter. I have lapped the timer when I have, so that I can see my achievement as well as my failure. Walking out of there, I was on a high of thinking that I don’t have to do what IT says anymore, and I have since managed to almost completely ignore it. The last month I have been so happy because of my GCSE’s being over, and my amazing boyfriend. This has hugely benefited my mind set and my ability to resist IT. I will have gone longer without touching things this month, I just haven’t been paying attention to it, because I don’t need to anymore. Today is the start of my new life without OCD. I have decided that for certain. I am strong enough. I can get rid of this and I will.
I am currently four hours and one minute into my freedom. I am going to do everything to keep it this way.
Fuck you OCD

45,"Hi all,
This weekend my brother was admitted to a specialist psychiatric hospital where he currently remains.  He is awaiting a full diagnosis and treatment plan.  I'm really very upset by this and am looking to understand how best to support him - perhaps from people who have been in hospital themselves?

I haven't yet gone to visit him, I was away for a couple of days, but to be honest I'm scared to go because I don't know what I'll find.  I've not even yet sent a text message, which I probably should get to as soon as possible, but I don't know what state he is in.  I want to support him, but don't know how he would react - would my message/visit upset him and make him worse?  Our parents are with him this evening, but apparently he spent all of last night screaming and refused to take a sedative the staff tried to give him.  It sounds so awful.

A little background - my brother is 8 years older than me, but we have been getting closer in the past couple of years.  He has a lower than average IQ, slight learning difficulties and is profoundly deaf (supported by a cochlear implant) all due to his premature birth.  However he is (or at least was until Saturday) an independent adult, fully employed, well travelled and with a good set of friends - a high functioning member of society. 

Last weekend he attended the ""Landmark Forum"", a self-help group which aims to break people down and then build them back up.  He came back a different person.  I thought he was just overexcited, but he spoke in a different way, not really making much sense.  He kept repeating their various mantras and sayings, seemingly at some kind of inner peace - not that he was ever really dissatisfied with his life.  He really wanted me to do the course myself and even send my daughter.

In the days following he became more and more confused with his communications becoming garbled and nonsensical.  

His housemate told me that on Friday night (it's not Monday evening) he was rambling on about being happy in life (""I'm happy in life - are you?"") but was confused about the time (""It's not 1am, it's only 11pm"") and became agitated when challenged to look at his phone and confirm the time.

On Saturday afternoon he want to see some friends but got lost - very unlike him.  One of his friends managed to get my brother to my parents house where mum took him to A&E.  He was assessed there and referred to a local psychiatric hospital to which he travelled with mum in a taxi.  She said that on the way he was increasingly confused and when he arrived he was very agitated and upset, not knowing where he was and seemingly lost his grip on reality.

Mum is, as you can imagine very distraught, and I'm very upset by the whole thing.

Also every time I give her advice, it'll turn into a fight. For instance, I'll tell my mom pay her bills on time and she'll reply ""don't tell me what to do"".

* More anxious than usual. Just anxious. Don't really know why. Small things make me worry about being watched. Not hard to speak to people though. No social anxiety. I can still talk with folks. If anything, my social anxiety has been fading really fast. I find myself speaking to people I would have never spoken to just 1 year ago. But I feel like everyone is monitoring me in a weird way. Like I just want to make sure I leave a good impression so it bothers me if they think negatively of me.

* Thoughts racing hard. Sometimes I get parts of the day where my thoughts are so fast, so sporadic, I can't keep up. It's like having zero concentration, but also have thousand miles an hour ""thought noise"". Like thinking about useless crap. Getting lost in thought. **This has effected me the most because I can't work well when I can't concentrate what so ever.**

* Sometimes, when I'm in a quiet room, I can hear a distant heavenly music. Never voices or anything. Music. Lovely music. *I am not hard of hearing however, have been tested and I am perfectly fine.*

66,"whenever i have a breakdown, i'll cry and cry and i become a huge mess and then when i think of self harming during those breakdowns i get super calm, i feel almost like im in a trance, and while im in that trance-like state i get whatever i use to self harm (razors usually) and i dont think i could stop myself when im like that even if i tried. its like im out of myself. i dont feel like i have control of my actions. does anyone know what this is or whats causing it? do other self harmers do this? like is it normal?

67,"I've had an incredible day in terms of getting things done. I want to keep working on my current project but it's giving me a super bad head ache and the starting's of anxiety and a stomach ache.

Help! I've felt things like this before but I don't know how to deal with it. I don't know if this is normal and it's a little scary and upsetting.",07Aug2017,1,
68,"I (17F) have been doing this for the longest time, and I do write. My characters (as I call them) are all based off of real people I know or based off of. I can create their whole personalities, their fashion choices, etc. I also can create dialogues of them talking to each other or doing things. I tend to ""roleplay"" with them with different people since I love to talk about them with everyone, and I (repeatedly unsuccessfully) tried to write about their adventures. The plot/characters can change every couple of to a few months, and when I think of that new plot, it seems like my mind and heart will push to use that new plot, despite how detailed my original plot is. Would you consider this some kind of mental illness, such as schizophrenia? In my life, I experience difficulties with making/keeping friends, so I'd rather think about the characters than about myself or any trouble I have to endure. It's where I think about my story for most if not all of the day, and I'm really happy when I think of the plot. I also can make any situation into a plot.
I'm not wanting to make fun of real people with the condition or anything similar. Just a thought. Thanks! ",07Aug2017,2,
