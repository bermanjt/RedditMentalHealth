Sometimes they let it slip, like, they'll say something to do with something that i've done which I've been thinking about at that exact moment, when they have no other possible way of knowing about what I did. I don't always feel like people want to hurt me, but I can't lay in bed with my headphones on and music up because I'm scared that someone will come in my room without me hearing and do bad things. I just feel like everyone knows everything about me, and it's driving me fucking crazy because I'm so paranoid and anxious all the time, I can never let go.",11Apr2017,6,

5,"Hello people of reddit,

I am a slightly recent reddit user (I made an earlier account last October, for mainly nosleep and glitch in the matrix story browsing), and not a frequent poster. I've decided to post here because I feel it would be the best place for me to find some answers. My google searches so far haven't given me anything.

To begin with, I am an introvert with (undiagnosed) social anxiety, which I have had since the ninth grade, when people became my greatest fear. This could be a large part of what is going on, though I'm not sure, as it's never been like this. I feel that I am losing my will to have conversation with people.

Over the years, my SA has definitely improved. I met some amazing, supportive, friends in grade ten who helped me to open up a lot more. They're off at University now, though we are still in contact.

Up until about January this year, though it was difficult for me, I was able to make small talk and even enjoy the fact that I was talking to people despite my fear of judgement and poor social skills. Every conversation I had (with co-workers for an example) was like an achievement to me. 

Since January of this year though, I've slowly been talking less and less. At work, I used to make an effort to make conversation--anything, so long as it would break the silence and help create a more friendly environment. The longer the silence, the more I would fear being judged as 'too quiet' or 'stand-offish'. 

Over the months though, I have lost this feeling of a need to speak. I've retreated farther and farther into my inner self and have been keeping to my thoughts, rather than bothering to socialize with co-workers (or anyone for that matter). I hardly even *try* to make conversation these days. 

With my family it's alright. I still talk to them normally, at least, but if it's anyone I don't know on a *highly* personal level, I find it difficult to make even the smallest effort to, say, comment on something even as mundane as the weather. Most days, I believe, you could count the number of times I've spoken on one hand--I just no longer feel it's necessary for me to use my voice. 

I feel that I have absolutely nothing to say to anyone, and this makes me sad, because I know I used to enjoy connecting with people. I don't understand what's happened. I feel that I'm losing myself in a way.

One of my worst fears is coming off as rude or stand-offish by not talking to people. And I believe that this is often the impression that I give people, unintentionally. It's not that I'm unfriendly, or that I dislike people--on the contrary. It's just that I don't have anything to say anymore, and it's getting kind of depressing. 

(A note: also, when I go for so long without speaking, I find when I finally say something to someone, my voice sounds odd and weak, as though I'm straining (a little) to get the words out. I wish to sound normal again, not like I am afraid of talking to them.)

Does anyone relate to this, or understand what could be the cause? I really want to find a solution to whatever this is. Could depression have anything to do with this?

Thanks for your time, and for listening to my rant. It's really such a relief to type all this out--it's been plaguing mind for a long time now.",11Apr2017,8,
6,"I'm actually worried I might be a sociopath. I frequently display incredibly anti-social behavior, can have a hard time empathizing, and have... questionable morals. Not anything horrifying, but while others are off preaching cultural empathy between doctors and patients, I'm the one who says ""#### empathy, this kid is dying and these parents are doing nothing. It's time to ditch empathy and save a life."" Or another example, I often am unable to tell when someone needs support, though I've at least taught myself that when someone's crying it's time to start faking empathy. Almost every display of empathy from me is just me studying how people act and using that. I genuinely like some people, and am able to empathize from time to time, but more often than not I'm just left conflicted. 

And again, my morals, while nothing super horrifying, aren't exactly... normal. I generally ditch emotions for what gets results (except for on the topic of lgbt issues. I'm cool with that, especially since I'm in the group). While others are off giving solutions that try to cater to everyone, I'm fine with one group being ditched so that the quickest, best result can be obtained.

Again, I'm genuinely concerned over this: am I a sociopath? Or is it just social issues? I don't really have a problem with being a sociopath, but I don't want to bring this up around people I know in my real life and get treated like a freak.",11Apr2017,1,
7,"I've helped friends through depression, self harm and through self esteem issues before.

I'm really looking for dos and fonts when talking about the subject.

8,"It all started 10 years ago. I had a best friend that was extremely manipulative and would use me to get the things he wanted to get. Then after a couple friendships of manipulated emotions I went to what was supposed to be a STEM middle school. That school ended up just being a drug filled terrible place which was full of horrible ""friends"". After that I had a couple people offer me hard drugs and I declined and moved out of state. Then moving I had no friends and was out of a comfort zone. Then came along the first person I felt I could talk to in a long time and for 2 years I dealt with her ungrateful manipulative drama filled personality. Now I show no emotions to anyone in fear of it being manipulated including my parents. I can't go into big social settings without breaking down and I've ended up blocking my parents out.

9,"So about two weeks ago, my roommate started acting very weird. He was very talkative and would go off on weird rants. The next day people convinced him to go to the psychology services on campus and long story short, his family comes to get him and takes him to a psychiatric hospital (not sure what the right term for it is) in our hometown. He was there for most of last week and got back to campus last Friday. He was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, type 1 I believe, and he was prescribed some meds. When I talked to him before he came up, he sounded more normal, not 100% normal, but more than what he was. But today, he just seems the same as he was before his family came to get him. He's been going on rants again and just acting really weird. Do meds take awhile to kick in? Should I be scared?

I could try my hardest to make my hands move, but they wouldn't until my thoughts were on something else.
I came back to the game on the next day, so I could try again, and I felt the same thing, but this time my hands were moving and ""trying"" to do the motion but in a vary poor way, slowly and sloppy. I couldn't complete the task once again.

13,"This is a throwaway account because my family is all on Reddit and they know my name very well. 

I am not sure exactly what this is so I think it's better to just give an example of what I mean. And yes, I am medicated and under the care of a psychiatrist and therapist and they are aware of my issue but haven't been super helpful (a few doctors- not just one). All I can think of is that maybe it's really uncommon? Or maybe their explanation of it being part of my panic disorder is correct. Either way, I could use some help in classifying it or maybe putting a name on what I am going through to help them better treat it, and maybe be able to do some better research myself. 

For the record... just typing this already makes me feel awful like- what if this actually does happen to my husband or another family member??? 

Rather recently, I have been having these *what if* thoughts. They are almost always *what if* so and so died. And I am absolutely devastated by that thought. And then when I explore my emotion further, it's accompanied by an odd feeling that I wouldn't describe even as relief. More like... as an example... let's say my husband passed away. I would be heartbroken and I don't know how I could even live without him. But there's this little voice inside my head that jumps forward and says like ""but think about all the freedom you would have to just make a decision without having to collaborate with him! You could live wherever you wanted! You could have buy sofa you guys are always arguing over that he doesn't want!!"" Stuff like that. 

I don't know if that makes sense but those little thoughts make me feel even worse and lead to anxiety and more minor panic attacks because they make me feel so awful and guilty. 

I would NEVER EVER do anything to hurt anyone- from people I love to myself to strangers, so that's not an issue. It's more just that weird little voice. I can't tell if my brain is just trying to protect me by saying yeah, your husband could die someday but hey! look on the bright side! As silly as that may sound. I really would prefer to not look on the bright side because, like I said, it just makes me feel even worse. 

Any advice or possible ideas of a clinical diagnosis or anything would be appreciated. ",11Apr2017,3,

17,"I have been diagnosed with insomnia, depression, anxiety, panic attacks , borderline personality disorder and bipolar.  I know seems like a lot right? Well it was. When I first got diagnosed I tried to commit suicide 4 times. We all know mental illness isn't pretty. Eventually my the doctors maxed me out on every drug they thought would help. That's 7 to be exact. Including two benzos.  If you don't know what benzodiazapines are, the withdrawl is similar if not equal to that of heroin  (not somethin to mess around with kids) where I live the max dose of clonzapam is 3mg I was on 4. I was on 50mg citalopam, 75?get seroquel, 150mg trazadone, I was also on 25mg methrotrimazapine ( nozonan) and 150 of buprophonal and when I really freaked out they gave me Ativan  (2mg) 

I was a zombie. I had to quit my job, my insomnia no matter what I took, kept me up for hours, and the medication that was supposed to remedy that made so tired I had to sleep for at least 10 hours, or I had to nap. Even then I napped. 

Eventually enough was enough, I hated being a zombie, all I did was sleep all day , and eat. I was munching so hard I slept ate with no recollection the next day..i went from being a 129 lbs beautiful blonde girl,(not to toot my horn but im being honest) and when it came to boys i had my pick of the litter .

2 years passed really fast, and now that i think about it, it's not that surprising considering I slept 13- 15 hours a day and I was Completely out of it. 

eventaully I moved somewhere I had family support and went to new doctors. But by then the damage was done I had gained 170lbs .and now I was so ashamed I couldn't leave the house. 

When I was there I told my doctor I wanted off the majority of my meds, so I had to go to the hospital to in the psych ward to deal with the withdrawl.when I left  I was on half the amount of medication , and half the amount of doses. When I came home instead of dealing with it like i did when i was a teen when I wanted to escape ( drinking drugs) started smoking a lot of weed. 

Today I have gotten MYSELF off of 7 medications. When I panick, I smoke a joint, when I'm stressed or too sad to deal or I'm having a manic episode and need to calm down I smoke a joint. And when I need to sleep and I can't instead of a dehabilitating sleeping pills I take thc pills.

The lithium, the benzos , the sleeping pills, they made me a walking talking zombie. The anxiety itself gives me nausea, dhiareeah, the side effects of the pills and all the med changes made me disorientated, constipated, i have suicidal thoughts, weight gain, rapid heart rate, the sweats the list goes on.


Here's my problem people. I got myself off all that toxic shit. But when I ask my Dr to write me a note stating my illnesses so I can go to a medicinal Marijuana clinic and talk to a Dr there who can prescribe me medicinal Marijuana, specific strains to treat specific symptoms, parts of the plant that aren't even psychoactive that help the chemicals in your brain to relax, edibles so I don't have to smoke and ruin my lungs THEY ALWAYS SAY NO

Why!? It doesn't make sense!?!?!??!! Weed is not addictive , yes it gives certain people anxiety , and can cause some people to have a psychotic break when abused but honestly most people it doesn't. It's all natural an it grows from the ground. The negative side effects such as motivation and hunger can be counteracted and the side effects of Marijuana are way way way less disruptive and life altering then pharmaceuticals.  


So what's your opinion my fellow mental health sufferers. Does weed help you? What Do you think of replacing harmful chemicals drugs with something all natural? Do you agree with legalization?
Tell me your opinion,I want to know if I'm not alone.",11Apr2017,2,

19,"A while ago my dad broke his tibial plateau and had to get several plates and screws to repair his knee.  Unfortunantely, he got a bone infection at the site of his break after the surgery and he received a cleanup surgery and was on an IV of antibiotics.  The doctors didnt know if the infection would prevent his bone from healing but fortunately the bone did heal and they took him off antibiotics.  But now, it appears his infection is coming back, or was never rid of in the first place.  This may be due to residual infection that was clinging on the hardware in his leg.

30,"Long story short, my official diagnoses is, in order of prevalence and importance: Generalised Anxiety, OCD, Major Depressive, Anorexia, Exercise Addiction.

Since 2008, I've been on countless combinations of meds. My psychiatrist guesstimated it'd be close to 30. The longest anything has ever really ""worked"" is 4 months with aropax. 

Pre-prescription drugs I was a high functioning alcoholic. I graduated university, had 2 jobs and a girlfriend, and played sport at a high level. I went on holidays, i went overseas, I was a normal human. 

Once I quit alcohol for good in 2011, my mental state slipped dramatically. I am now a hollow shell compared to the person I once was. I have very little social life, play no sports, have no sex drive, and I'm unable to go on holidays, to sit down for more than an hour... Basically, my life isn't a life, it's survival mode.

Am I being silly in thinking maybe alcohol could have been helping me? It may have been masking my major problems, but I've spent countless hours (must be close to... I don't even know, 800?) in therapy in the last 8 years working through my major problems and I only seem to be deteriorating. 

My body struggles with the anxiety and depression, to the point I can't even put a shirt on because my neck and shoulders are so tense.

So... Should I go to my psychiatrist (who I have a great and honest relationship with) and ask if alcohol might be a better solution? Or is that just silly? ",11Apr2017,5,
31,"So, I have been seriously struggling the past couple of months, and last night I decided to stop taking everything so personally. Some things in my life are shit, but I know that most is logically really good. Yet still I still have felt quite low, fairly regularly. 

I think for my life I have latched onto people. To distract others from me but also to feel safe. But when people stop being as close to me as I would be comfortable with, I have accepted that I am quite needy, I withdraw sometimes fairly drastically and find it hard to find a balance and healthy relationship. I see that others need space, and I think this is how I have kept any relationships. I have found a man that I fell head over heels in love with and I really would like to not fuck it up. I have withdrawn though. I find it difficult to ask him to do things because I imagine that he would rather just do things without me. He invites me to hang with his friends and I leave him go alone because I am afraid that I will ruin their time. 

Has anyone else had any experience with this? Has anyone any advice on how to stop being either roasting hot, or freezing cold in relationships? 

I know that I have a really low view of myself and Im working on that separately. I'm waiting to see a councilor at the moment, but until that happens I would like to try and work through as much as I can on my own so that I can get the most out of the sessions. ",11Apr2017,1,

38,"I have always struggled with pretty bad anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember, I remember relatively well to about 14 but have very few fuzzy vague memories prior to that due to sexual abuse and an overall traumatic and difficult home life.

This is difficult to explain, but about a year ago I had a vague memory of sexual abuse occurring at about the age of 8. It felt like a dream, and was so fuzzy and vague that it made me feel crazy. It was so real but at the same time I felt so disconnected from it, it felt like I was watching a movie. After discussing this with my therapist she told me this was dissociation and it most likely did occur and I was experiencing the disconnected feeling because it is my brains way of coping with a traumatic experience and again and overall traumatic childhood.

Over the past few years I have been prescribed numerous antidepressants from my primary care doctor, none of them working out for me, but have never been to a legitimate psychiatrist and I just feel so strongly that something is wrong with me that extends further than just being and depressed and anxious teen. Here are a few of my symptoms. I would appreciate if you guys would provide some insight and help me come up with ways to cope with these things: 

-Pertaining to my sexual abuse, and the abuse I endured throughout childhood I feel extremely emotionally detached. I don't feel connected at all to the situation, rather I feel I am watching a movie and am just seeing the little girl and feel sorry someone would do that to her and not necessarily that it happened to me. BUT I do get flashbacks and occasionally obsess over the thoughts specifically when I am in the shower.
- I feel as though my life is a dream, and there is no way out. I feel so disconnected from myself and everyone else and I have no other way of really describing this feeling but it makes me feel trapped and like the only way out is to die. I feel like a robot in a sense.

- My moods circulate in cycles. I will be deeply depressed to the point I can't get out of bed and have a lot of the dream feeling and deep contemplation on life that makes me uncomfortable, then I will become extremely anxious to the point it makes me physically ill and I can't go into work without having an intense panic attack.
-I'm explosively angry, irrational, and mean
- I get super worried if someone is leaving even if it's just for a few days or overnight because I feel like they'll realize they don't love me anymore 
-I have a ridiculously overwhelming fear of people leaving me. I am always worried about people thinking negative things about me behind my back and only staying with me because of pity, or my friends and family hating who I am as a person and always talking and gossiping about me. It really affects my relationships as I always think my significant other is going to leave me/ doesn't love me anymore, in turn pushing them away
- I don't sleep at all. In the last 3 days I have slept 9 hours. 
- I feel trapped in humanity and so weird about watching people's interactions and how weird we are, I can't even explain this one. I feel trapped and like there is no escape.
- I always feel like people are scheming behind my back 

There's so much more and of course the typical anxiety and depression symptoms but these are the big basis of my current issues. I would appreciate any insight and help. I feel so trapped and like there is nothing I can do to not feel this way and like I'll always be so disconnected and it makes me want to die. Please help.  ",11Apr2017,3,
39,"Hello. My name is Anger. I am currently 20 years old and studying computer science on an university.

I really fell in love with unix and am slowly developing passion with programming and I really want to be good programmer but oh gosh, just the image of me going home and programming and studying all day makes me feel really empty. 

I really want to be great. I am ambiverted person who locks emotions inside and am passive on the outside. I feel I have the will to go for challenges, I mean, I am competitive and a team player/synergizer, but I am sort of alone now.

My problem is, everytime I am home and I have to do something like homework, study, programming. I just say ""I will find another way"" and I'm off to play Mass Effect Andromeda and League of Legends. I feel like I am addicted to the fun it generates in my brain during the play and the complexity of the systems behind in, as I find myself quite often thinking ""What is the best build? What could work?"" or also ""My plan now is to focus playing support and climbing"". Once I got over this addiction but it feels like I fell back into it.

I really ask, how to deal with this? My univeristy is spamming me with homework so I can't really afford to play this much. And my brain tells me my life belongs there and I should go for it.

I could really blame everything: My brother still didn't move and I lack my personal space, the atmosphere home is lacking, I don't feel motivated to go for this, etc...

But I really don't wanna blame, I wanna go on. I am 20 years old and playing games really makes my mind scream ""Why are you doing this? Stop."" all the time, so it's barely enjoyable, but I still do it.

My heart and respect will belong to you even if you try to give me an idea that won't work well. The issue I feel is lack of motivation and the feeling of boredom/empty life. I know many people will laugh at me for this but meh.

*So summary:*
**My current problem is:** I am avoiding my duties, I am negating my future career (I didn't have that many jobs, I worked as a waiter to make money for my laptop, and before I worked in a company from which I got fired, but they didn't really explain me what they wanted me to do) if I have one, and I am wasting my time playing games(mainly) or googling random things/reading reddit. I am lacking passion for study and motive for programming. I am not living the way I would want to, it feels like I'm hiding in the virtual world maybe?

**The problem solution I would possibly need (optional of course)**: There is no divine solution like a mantra that would make me instantly stop playing games and focus on things I want because I feel the image of me studying and programming all day as it feels empty and boring. But maybe a challenge? Or some kind of logical sentence that would make me see or realise? Perharps something that made you feel more joy in programming/other hobby than gaming?

**The conclusion I want:** Being a successful student (oh god that sounds so nerdy, sure go ahead and laugh) and programmer.

I really feel this is a problem and I have to face it somehow. But I just am not able to. Suggestions?

*ABOUT MY WEIRD PATIENCE:*
I know I have the potential to do great things but my patience often runs out. The stimuli of experiencing new things/joy I think. During a stereotype routine like go out and run/go workout would always end badly for me as I could only go on for a month or so. But many negated challenges like don't shave for as long possible, don't drink coke (I grew up on coke) and NoFapChallenge (uhh, laugh again) would go on somewhat good. I quit drinking coke, I drink water now, but I still enjoy coke on some occassions. I managed to win the no-shave challenge longest from any of my friends, then I shaved (i hate not shaving) and my NoFap is doing... well sometimes well. I also consider myself very patient and daring, but I just can't program for dayyysss.. it's empty!
Now there is this bonus, if you've ever played **RuneScape**, I was a kid and played this game and I always wanted a hunter cape which needed level 99 to buy, but exping hunter took days, if not months to gain. It required many hours of constant pointless CLICK CLICK CLICK. I managed to do this longest for 5 days, 15 hours then I had to do something else. After few years I managed to get 99 hunting and 99 fishing aswell. I remember I got 99 fishing thanks to chatting with a friend and fishing was secondary for me.
I just wanted to leave this runescape experience here so you can meet my mental image better and perharps help me out. I still don't think anyone will read this/bother to respond, but thanks anyway.",11Apr2017,3,

43,"Im 15 years old. Last year I had a sudden experience in which I felt like the world wasn't real and my limbs just didnt seem to belong to me. It was very much like depersonalization but people describe it as quite an unpleasant experience whereas I actually enjoyed it. This year I have been having really mixed and wierd symptoms and I just cant put a finger on what is happening. 

Firstly, I have always been quite socially awkward. However, in the past year it has felt like im tripping over all my spoken works and I just cant talk without jumbling my speech no matter how hard I try. When trying to describe about myself by talking or even writing on paper, I find it difficult to do so because I feel like there is wayy too much to say about myself to even summarise it. I feel alone and as if I am the only person who knows something. Recently I have loved being alone at home or in a forest. When going out anywhere I feel very insecure and judged by everybody even if it isnt the case. I don't go to the gymn to work out because of the same reason and instead do it in the nearby forest. I have felt like I need to repress my emotions of happiness and sadness. Also, I have been hearing the sound of a phone ringing occasionally and have believed that it is some form of extra terrestrial life force attempting to help me leave the dimension and when the sound disappears I feel upset as if I have failed them. My thoughts are quite scattered too. 

It is worth knowing that I am an indigo child or so I think because these wierd and scary symptoms are making me doubt it now. Any help would be much appreciated. ",11Apr2017,1,

45,I'm still a minor (17) and I want to talk about my past trauma. But I'm afraid that my therapist will report it. I'm currently safe the abuse stopped about 4-5 years ago. So does anyone know if past abuse is still reportable in the state of California? And if its possible to keep my mother in the dark about my therapy sessions concerning my trauma? I don't want my therapist mentioning to her that I'm suffering because of stuff she did to me in the past.,11Apr2017,1,

47,"I have OCD and have recently recovered from a terrible obsession on harming others. Even now I get the odd fear but it doesn't effect my daily functioning. The OCD changed my life and I feel like I haven't really ever gone back to life before OCD. I'm not lonely and I have friends but I'm disturbed by uneasy feelings all day. I feel that the world is lacking almost like a video game world. The future scares me as like what if I have OCD in future and stuff like that. I guess it could be derealisation but there's other stuff aswell. Like one time I was faced with a ton of scary derealisation thoughts and felt so scared I thought I was having suicidal thoughts. The world just feels to freaking strange. It's so hard to explain how I feel because even I can't really tell. I want to label it or maybe at least have some ideas of what it could be just so I can work with it and live my life. I've these feelings of fear sadness and detactchment for at least 9 months and I don't want to waste time thinking about it. It's weird but sometimes I get scared that the worlds all weird and I make myself think of some distant Asian country or somewhere I want to visit and it makes me feel comfortable. It's hard to explain and I'm sure I sound crazy right now but I just feel odd. Any of this sound familiar to anyone?

Many thanks and good luck with your mental health!",11Apr2017,2,
48,I know I should get a job or something (I'm a college student in Florida) but it's uncomfortable to have to focus on everyday life and have this constant obsession. I don't like talking much so I haven't really been meeting new people. Is there a medication I can ask a psychiatrist about that can reduce this obsession?,11Apr2017,1,

54,"I'm 16 years old and living in  Pennsylvania, US. I feel I was wrongly diagnosed with autism. I was diagnosed originally with severe social anxiety at 7, but my mom wouldn't stop pushing doctors and switching clinics until I got an autism diagnoses like my brother. I was diagnosed with PDD NOS at 9. I'm very bitter towards it due to the limits it's put on my life. I also had trouble receiving Diagnoses I really needed after that. No one believed I was depressed until I was hopsitalized for a suicide attempt when I was 12. They said it was just autism ticks or whatever, And even after my hospitalization tried to send me to a ASD clinic for treatment and they still weren't addressing my depression and self harm, but instead my nonexistent rage and sensory issues. I wasn't sent to a correct treatment until my second suicide months later. Now I'm struggling with something else. Over the past year I've begun struggling with my body image and over the past six months lost around 35 pounds (leaving me almost 20 underweight) I want help to return to my normal life (school, work, dance, friends) but I'm sick and consumed with fear of weight gain and not exercising. I'm being sent to an autism feeding clinic to address yet again a noexisant fear, a fear of texture and food in my mouth. I purge I don't fear texture and food in my mouth. I feel I need an ED clinic, but my new doctor (old one dropped me for losing more weight than her expertise could handle and not showing enough autism symptoms) and diagnosis won't permit. I don't wanna fight for my life again.",11Apr2017,13,

58,"Hello everyone,

To start off, English isn't my native tongue. Feel free to correct my mistakes, as I'm trying to become better at the language.

I'm a young woman who is quite confused. Five years ago, I realised that I have quite the disturbed personality. My symptoms are the following.

• My range of (positive) emotions is very limited. I can feel frustration, fear, shame, regret, anger, jealousy, sadness (I think? Or at least hopelessness) very short and rare moments of a positive bliss (once in a couple of years) and just a comfortable feeling of accepting the day.

• As a kid I did some disturbing things. I hit my grandma with a rock. Abused pets (No torture for fun, I just let my anger loose on them by physically hurting them.), lied frequently and stole a couple of times from my parents.

• I don't seem to be able to form healthy connections to other people. I obsess about one person and get possessive.. Though I never show it to them, it causes me great anxiety and I will try to find ways to manipulate them without making it too obvious. I'll even fake (serious) diseases just to gain their attention. Yet I am pretty good at hiding my shit.. Since I've been able to keep up a relationship of five years... And he still thinks I'm the sweetest person ever and he has never felt used or manipulated. I know how to not overdo it and I know when to just give up and try to look at things from a healthier point of view... Yet I keep going back to the same unhealthy strategies.

• I have fantasies about being a hero or a savior.. These are one of the few things that make me feel good.

• There is almost nothing (except for my partner) that gets my attention or interest. I'm incredibly passive and will get through weeks of doing absolutely nothing. Nothing is fun to me, everything that requires effort, is a chore that I'd like to avoid. Though I'm not happy doing nothing either. 

• The previous point makes me a rather socially awkward person if I'm not able to lie. I've been trying to quit lying so much and since then I realised that I cannot keep up an intelligent conversation, since I have absolutely nothing to talk about (No hobbies, passions, interests of even fun thoughts in my head). 

• I seem to experience some sort of depersonalisation, as I have no sense of self. Sometimes, when I look at my mother, I'm weirded out by the fact that she is my mother.. Yet I feel nothing for her.. The same thing happens when I look in the mirror.

There is a lot more.. But these are the things that come to mind. Psychopathy, since I have a lack of real love, empathy or remorse, seems to be the most obvious choice. Yet I am trying to become more 'normal' and I do not like my life. I am no thrill seeker (more of a chicken, really) and if I could, I'd like to feel real connections and have a healthy personality. I'd like to enjoy hobbies and be interested in things... These seem to be things that most psychopaths don't relate to. They usually like who they are and take advantage of it.. While I seem to be struggling.

Therapy always goes wrong, since I don't know how to honestly talk to someone. I can't form thoughts in my head and retreat to the facade of normalcy that I've build up through the years. I never ever get emotional around someone, except for irritation... Otherwise.. I'm just blank. 

I'm unsure about what to do next....

EDIT:

Some more weird things that speak against psychopathy are that I experienced a sense of loss when my grandfather died. I still can't watch the videos I have of him. I also experience anxiety about losing my partner, who is terminally ill. I do appreciate his company and think he is a great person. I'm not with him to gain anything materialistic...Just because it gives me some kind of stimulation that fills the void.
