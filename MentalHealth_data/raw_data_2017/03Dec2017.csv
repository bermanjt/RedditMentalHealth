0,"Today was a bad day. Full of negativity and bad luck.
Short story I snapped and went home to get some lunch and calm down, and the Christmas parade had my house blocked in so I had to park 5 kilometres away from my house and walk home in the freezing cold. 
      My mind was gone by the time I got Home, I couldn't think straight other than cursing my head off. My boss eventually calls asking where I am, offers to give me a ride to get my car. I was so out of it I could barely say a word. I feel like crap because I avoided him. I didn't know what to say and couldn't imagine going back to work for 4 hours of dealing with my co workers  negativity.
    I called someone to come over and talk, they helped calm me down really well, but I still have no idea what to say or do about my job and boss. He knows i have mental issues (schizophrenia) and still seems dead set on making me work alongside this constant negative presence by myself and when I call or message and I'm clearly in a bad way, offers nothing more than a ""awe that's too bad, do you need a ride to work?""",03Dec2017,1,
1,My current therapist saved my life however i had an incident. Am i reading into this?I went to my therapist today at 11:30. Turns out that the appointment was for 11 and I was late at the hospital.I have never been late. Dunno how i got confused. She didn't seem pissed but I felt really really bad. I asked her what could be done and she said that we still had 30 minutes and I felt really really hurt. We talked for 5 minutes and suddenly there was a siren and we had to evacuate the wing. On the way out she was talking to her friend who is a doctor and I was walking alone. I felt so rejected and terrible. She obviously didn't charge me and we fixed a new appointment for Monday. I have been diagnosed as being bipolar and am very depressed right now. Only person who has ever helped me is my therapist. Have important exams in a few days and don't know what to do. My friends were total jerks to me and i helped them a lot monetarily and emotionally but they just left when i needed someone to talk to.,03Dec2017,2,
2,"This is really distressing me, I feel like I might be a psychopath. 

I generally think I’m a kind, caring person. But sometimes I get this feeling - I can’t describe it, it’s like butterflies or some kind of excitement - and it happens when I think something bad might happen.

For instance a close relative has a terminal illness. I love her and I’m terrified of losing her. Every time she has a scan, there’s a fear it’ll be bad news. But when I imagine it happening, I get that butterfly, almost hopeful feeling. I don’t want her to be sick, what the fuck is wrong with me?

Another example: friend was in then hospital and went into a coma. We were all waiting for news for days. When it sounded like things were looking up, my literal first reaction almost felt like disappointment. This is a friend I care about! She very sadly passed away a few days later and I was devastated. What the fuck is wrong with my brain???

I don’t know if I maybe enjoy drama or if it’s anxiety and I’m confusing it for excitement, or if the “hope” is just wanting it to be over with. I’m a monster. Does anyone else have this?",03Dec2017,2,
3,"I’m a teenager in the U.S (surprising, I know) who’s struggled with self-esteem issues for a while (~10 years). I’ve recently started questioning my mental health. 

Some context (long):

1) I had a lot of Internet friends, many of whom had mental health issues. I think the normalization of depression/suicide/anxiety/mental illness in general (because I was constantly exposed to it) desensitized me, or at least led me to believe I was like them. As a result, I frequently joke about death/suicide. I didn’t think this was good for me and cut contact with my Internet friends two months ago.

2) I was bullied extensively in middle and when elementary school (when I was 8-13). I developed low self-esteem and have had it ever since.

3) Both of my parents were depressed before, though only when I was extremely young. My dad attempted suicide (again, when I was young — I only learned about this later.)

4) I have a good, strong relationship with both my parents. However, my dad sometimes threatens to kill himself or leave and has for the past 5 years (not in front of my mom). 

5) School keeps me extremely busy. I’m involved in many clubs and I play sports, so I’m not totally isolated.

6) To be blunt, I have no close or meaningful relationships after ending my Internet friendships.

7) I’ve thought about death for the past ~4 years. For the past ~3, it’s roughly been at least 5x a week if not once a day. It wasn’t really serious, though. I’ve never attempted suicide.

_

I have no clue what’s going on. 

School stress is typical, but nearly every day, I feel like a disappointment/failure. This has been happening for at least 5 years, though it’s been especially bad for the past 3. 

I tried talking to a school counselor 3 times, on my parents’ recommendation, and didn’t feel it helped. 

Having no close relationships means I feel lonely, but I push away everyone who tries to get close to me. I definitely have friends, but no one I’d talk to outside of school. 

The problem is that when people talk to me or ask personal questions, I get irrationally annoyed/irritated. One of my friends (I’m not close with her) is frequently affectionate with me or tries to talk to me, and I just get annoyed.

Between the school stress, a lack of emotional intimacy (that I guess I don’t even want), and self-esteem issues, I have more or less felt terrible for the past 5 years. Am I depressed or overreacting? It definitely feels like I have no reason to feel like this. Is something else wrong? And what do I do?

My life is just school. It definitely isn’t bad or hard, but I feel bad and empty/dull. I never feel good enough. I get easily annoyed. The limited help I’ve gotten hasn’t helped, because I’ve felt like this for years.

TL;DR: American high-schooler who used to be bullied with used-to-be depressed parents and depressed Internet ex-friends. For the past 5 years, heavily involved with school, stressed, no friends, easily annoyed, hypocritical, feels like a failure, wants death. Talked to counselor few times and felt nothing. 

Is this normal, especially for it to have lasted for years? Am I right to question my mental health? What should I do now if I felt my other options haven’t helped?",03Dec2017,2,
4,"They just keep saying bs like why can't you go to Harvard. Medical science is bad. Psychologists are bad. Your friends have done it why can't you? There is no such thing as depression. You are a liar. What does your psychologist say? What counselling is she doing? They have always targeted my friends since I was a kid. Hope I can earn money and they die and I live alone. I hope I can sell their house off when they die. I was never encouraged to get out of my house or talk to people. I cant even look at people in their eyes and used to beat myself when i didn't get something in studies cause my mom used to hit me when she used to make me study and bite me too.

i also feel like im walking naked at times as my dad used to threaten to throw me out of his house as a kid naked if i didnt study. He never got me help when i kept burning myself and used to keep crying till i was 20 but got help when i wasnt studying and still didnt give me any time to recover. Unfortunately i live in a shitty country so just cant take a job at any place and start earning. Im stuck in a uni degree i dont like and dont know if i will get a job.",03Dec2017,3,

8,"I'm a 20 year old guy. One day in 9th grade (6 years ago) I smoked and got a little high, like I normally would with my friends. About 30 minutes into the sesh it was suddenly as if I was looking at myself from a 3rd person POV, as a total stranger. I completely forgot who I was and everything about my life. I went to the bathroom and just stared at myself in the mirror for a while as everything came slowly back to me. It took probably about an hour. It was sort of reflective. I realized that this was my life and mine alone. I just told this story to my roommate and she is telling me that this is very abnormal and I should look into it. I almost forgot it happened, since it hasn't since. Just curious, has anyone here ever experienced anything like this or know anything about it?",03Dec2017,4,

10,"I've been planning on committing suicide for a couple of months. I OD'd twice in a week, using a few weeks worth of my medicines each time. I was unsuccessful and consequently institutionalized. It along with my outpatient therapy have had no effect. I plan to mix the two and for good measure locking myself in a running car in an enclosed garage. I need to know amounts because since the previous attempts my family monitors me greatly, I am underage, so my access to alcohol is limited, and my pill bottles are locked away. I need a rough estimate of how much I need to get the job done.",03Dec2017,1,
11,"For the record, this is a long story. 

I grew up in an East Asia metropolis; people are super competitive since they were stillborn and everyone lives like a soulless zombie. According to my Mom, I first attempt suicide when I was three, although I remember my first time was five years old. I don't think my mother has a point to lie though. Fast forward a bit to primary school. My emotional unstableness became a severe problem thus I couldn't fit into the conventional school environment--I was too active. I got bullied all the time because of my eccentricity. Maybe me always calling my peer ""stupid"" help fueled the hatred toward me too. My Mom blames it to my ""gifts,"" we didn't have the resources (money) to do an assessment, my mother thinks so because people keep saying to my parents that they should take me to do it. ""Make it official."" They said. Anyways, for whatever reasons, I got bullied in school and often misunderstood by teachers (basically everyone actually). Since my parents tried to let me grow up without pressure, they picked a very relaxed kindergarten. When I was in First Grade, SARS happened, and my home city was patient zero. We missed almost half of the school year. Because I didn't have a tutor, I couldn't keep up with school for ever since. More than that, I began to realize I couldn't understand human emotions and I have huge difficulty in finding the right words to express myself accurately. At last, I graduated from primary school with none self-esteem, full of resentment to the world. I was apparently not happy. But who cares? Everyone is miserable in this city. 

Then I went to secondary school. Things got worse. To a point, I would cry in class without noticing so myself while immensely focusing on writing a mock exam paper; I had panic attacks almost every three days; I had attempted suicide publicly more than three times; I had extremely violence visions in my head...My grade didn't get better, no matter how many time people ask me how can I be so ungrateful to my parents who support me to attend privte schools all my life, by wasting my talent with laziness. They didn't get an answer because I didn't know. 

Of course, I failed my university entrance exam. My mother wishes I can continue to study, at least getting a BA. But I couldn't get into any school, so I came to the US to study at a CC, hopefully, I can transfer. I was doing fabulous for the first semester. Then in the second semester, I met an Egyptian professor, his teaching method reminded me of my past. Eventually, I broke down. After another semester, things with my then-roommates went seriously wrong. I knew it was me, so I began to seek help. It spent me another year, until a half year ago I finally got the proper diagnoses and treatment. I am diagnosed BPD, Bipolar, depression, anxiety, dyslexia. On top of those, I am suspected to have Asperger's and ADHD plus minor sex and alcohol addiction. For Asperger's and ADHD, I might not have a chance to get diagnosis anymore because I am already turning 22, an adult. Legitimate services (screening and assessment) for adults in these aspects are insufficient as all people had presumed one would be spotted when they are young. I might never know what cause my life miserable or be able to get the help I need just because of that. 

The moral of my story is: parents, PARTICULARLY Asian parents, DON'T WAIT UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE. Please, don't let your child/children go(es) through what I've been through, especially nowadays you have so much more support than ever before. Listen to them, talk to them. My younger sister is experiencing almost the same things I did (the mental illness stuff is kind of runs in the family). Luckily, my parents took actions this time, and she's out of danger so far. It nearly cost them a daughter to learn this lesson. I don't think you'd want to it the same way they did. 

TL;DR: My home city's education environment and society were too twisted, plus a backward mental health care system; my first twenty years of life was fucked up. I urge parents to take my experience as a lesson and do the right things. 

P.S I might have missed a lot of words. I apologize for that. Gramma Nazis are absolutely welcome here. ",03Dec2017,2,
12,"I've been seeing a therapist to try and cope with severe depression and mild psychosis and one thing she brought up is how I seem to have very severe trust issues regarding other people (which makes sense - I have kind of an emotionally abusive family, so I didn't disagree).

But one of the reasons I started to see her in the first place is because I haven't had a crush or emotional connection to anyone in 15 years (for perspective, I'm 30). I make friends because it's something to do, not really because I want to get to know someone better. And now I'm wondering if my trust issues as a result of my family didn't cause me to put up such extreme walls that I just stopped having an interest in other people together because that automatically became dangerous? 

I don't know. I don't even seem to have a sexuality anymore, and I thought it was a medical problem but maybe it's a mental one, and I'm lost. I just feel so sad and distant, like a bad imitation of a human. I want to connect with people again and I feel like it's something I no longer am capable of doing.",03Dec2017,2,

15,"Just a disclaimer: yes, im currently in therapy and my psychiatrist have been made aware of it.
Hello reddit, so I've been stuck in this situation ever since around 3 years ago where I came down with a depression that im still struggling to come up from. Im a 26 year old transgirl ( not on HRT yet) with diagnosed autism (with a prior ADHD diagnose that got discarded in favor of autism because new tests showed that I was outside the adhd spectrum) and for a long time its like I hit this point where when im extremely overtired, I become productive and really creative, I suddenly get motivation to clean my apartment and do homework or read something informative, where as on the other hand, when im well rested i dont wanna do anything productive or struggling to actually get started. At this point I really hate going to sleep because I know ill wake up and be well rested but with no sort of motivation to do anything worthwhile and productive which in term makes me dig myself further down the depression hole. I also feel much more in tune with my feelings when im at this state of extreme overtiredness, like I feel that im much more in tune with how I feel.
I really dont know what to do, I know this is extremely unhealthy for me and at this point I dont even know if im just deluding myself.
My therapist have said that its seen in manic people but havent really said anything more about this specific problem.
TL;DR I feel much better and more motivated than ever when I stay up all night and im always afraid of going to sleep because I know that the world is gonna look grey when I wake up.",03Dec2017,0,
16,"(Long ~__~ sorry) 
So, I’ve been on the medication Prozac for about a year and a half to help with my really bad anxiety and depression. I don’t know when it started really, I think it’s been there since I was young as it took extra long for me to get over a pets death or was unwilling to join other kids games and sleepovers I was invited too. Mental health problems are strong in my family, mainly my mums side. She noticed early on that that could be the problem but she kinda, I don’t know how to explain it, she told me this after it got very bad and she took me to a doctor, vet she didn’t want it to be happening to me do just kinda.. ignored it, hoped it was something else. It was only after I would come home from school and go straight to bed, had panic attacks over simple math homework, or would call her three times a week after freaking out in class that she sat me down and told me it could be something more serious. I knew about mental illness and could identify it in others but it just never occurred to me I could be suffering from it.. I always just told myself I didn’t sleep well or are stress about a thing that is coming up. After the talk with my Mum it kinda clicked. Even so my mum still put off taking me to the doctor for a little while but I wanted help. It sucked feeling like that and I was sick of hiding behind a smile and my jokes.  Didn’t look or ack depressed at school or in town but, it was kinda myself getting so irritated I other people. I went to a university forum debuting the break before my last year of high school so was able to talk and interact with likeminded people and experience living in a city and going to the university, but when I started school again in my small home town with all the petty bitchness that is immature teenagers  .. idk it was hard, getting dragged into stir I didn’t care about or getting targeted by one of the ‘popular’ kids because I took a leadership role they were wanting.. idk it was just petty and stupid waist of time and effort, and it just tipped the skates of what I could handle. So I crashed. I would talk to my Mum about these things and she would say I’m an adult stuck in a child’s body. I love my mum so much and she is my rock. Anyway, sorry this is long haha spilling out my life story here ~__~. But I got put on the antidepressant Prozac and it generally works well for short time use. But I’ve been on it for almost two years and the side effects really started to show.  I went on exchange this year so my doctor recommended I stay on the drug. I was starting to feel better but still had episodes , that’s why he thought it was best. But only of the side effects I really noticed, and the one he warned me about, was the emotional numbness. The drug is designed to stop extremism negative emotions ~ anxiety ~ but I knotweed almost instantly it stoped all extremes. Excitement. I didn’t feel much when I got on a plain to the other side of the world for my exchange. Sadness. I didn’t feel anything when my cat died or when I walked though Auschwitz in Poland. Happiness. Yeah I laughed and felt  ‘good’ when I was with friends but it didn’t stick. I haven’t felt homesick at all this year, and it often slips my mind to keep in contact with people, I forget that they feel. God I missed feeling. I have tried a few times this year to take my self of the medication without success. I know it’s not recommended to do that yourself incase of relapse, but I was desperate and could recognise if I was getting bad again. But more recently I tried again. And so far it’s working. I’ve been feeling really good lately with a lot of meet ups with friends and a good host family. Christmas is coming up so it’s very festive. The weather is cold but it snows which is amazing (where I live at home it never snows). My emotions are coming back. I have gone off my mess for about three weeks and they are already starting to appear. Sadness was the first. Not bad sadness mind you, but during a sad part of a movie I felt it. I haven’t felt that in so long it was strange. Happiness. Genuine happiness. I felt so happy after I found the perfect secret Santa gift that I actually did a little skip. I’m starting to get excited when opening my event calendar and for upcoming events. It sounds strange but I hope I feel a little bit homesick for Christmas. Feel. God I love that word. Feel. I could be thinking about something a a rush of emotions would come over me in an intense wave and I had forgotten that they work like that. I had got so used to being numb. Not everything has returned yet. It’s mainly the extremes. Eventually though I hope normal, small emotions start coming back. I go home in less then a month but I don’t know what to tell my doctor as we were supposed to start taking me off the drugs after I got back or move me onto something more long term. I would prefer not to take anything but I worry that after coming home from the buzz of travel I will have a relapse. But I’m going to university soon after I get back. I think if I just keep my mind busy and stay on top of my work load it will be okay. Hopefully all the drama queens stayed at high school of whatever whole the reside in. Sorry again for the long post.. I just needed to vent a bit. I like places like this where you can just talk without judgment. Thanks ~~ :) ",03Dec2017,2,

21,"18, living in Australia, a job that’s got its good &amp; and bad days. Loving family and good friends. But I want to die.

Typically I would vent this sort of shit out on one of my usual personal social media’s but with all of my friends &amp; family connected on them I wouldn’t want them to know what I go through on a daily, repetitive basis.

I’m basically as normal as normal gets, normal friends &amp; family and normal troubles. Except when troubles get to me they get to me personally and deep now. I never used to be like this, back when I was in highschool me and my friends would joke about dark and cruel shit. But nowadays I feel as if even if one of my friends make a joke remotely about me it’s a personal attack. Even this latest joke they came up with out of the blue “my names *insert my name here*, yeaaaah” feels as if they’re trying to attack me on a personal level. I’ve even threatened one of my friends to rearrange their fucked teeth if they made the joke again....

I’ve been struggling with my emotions for awhile now but suddenly it’s starting to snowball and I feel completely out of touch with everything and everyone I’m around. I’m the kind of person to keep my emotions to myself. My friends know I’m having it rough but they don’t know the extent of it. I just have random depressive episodes around them which they notice but typically gets blown off with a couple jokes and then I’ll usually disassociate myself from everybody for awhile until I can actually manage myself again. I’ve made the joke that I still haven’t cried for at least a year and honestly I haven’t.... I’ve tried to cry so many times now but because I’ve always bottled up my emotions to stop myself from crying I feel as if I literally cannot. Right now even I feel as if I’m on the verge but it never comes. I want to experience that again so it hopefully brings a small amount of clarity to my life. That I can actually feel real emotions again. 

I feel as if some of my problems stem from the fact of my highschool crush rejection. Typical fucking girl you *think* is perfect but she’s not interested so you try to push yourself to forget her. But I can’t. I’ve dated other girls (that have gone ahead and backstabbed me as well) but I’ve always only thought about her. My friend who I’ve told this about that is outside of my normal friend group told me it’s probably for the best that I don’t try to date other girls but just want for a relationship to present itself to me, may that be the girl that’s constantly on my mind or someone else. I feel this idea is just a double edged sword for me because I’ll just keep on thinking something could happen between us but obviously nothing will until I find someone else to seek me out. I have one friend who constantly makes fun of me for my crush on this girl (same whom I threatened to remove his teeth) so should I just somehow cut him out of my life? I’m not going to sit down and talk to him about this. We’re not that kind of people. So do I just stick up with it until it’s over and he forgets about it. 

Time for me to bitch about my work I guess. I feel like I am good at my job, a store man at a CCTV company who goes above and beyond as I’ve been told. Even tho officially I’m just a guy who works in the warehouse I’ve always taken time to study the products and learn how they all work together, I am at the point I’m basically a “secondary internal sales”. I have good coworkers but a frustrating boss. I’ll work hard and I only get recognised for the shit that gets missed from my boss. While everyone else congratulates me on my hard work. I’ve been told by the store manager my hard work hasn’t been unnoticed and that I should be given full time &amp; pay raise before the end of the year but I was told that a month ago and nothing. I don’t feel like I’ve fucked up significantly in anyway and I’m basically going to need to be relying off my savings to me through the holidays which I was hoping to keep buy myself a new project car. Sometimes I just feel like quitting. And I’ve been so close to just telling my boss to fuck himself and leave the store and I feel as if part of the cause is my worsening temper and lack of control of my emotions. Even at the point of which when customer’s give me shit I’ll snap back at them passively aggressive. But yeah, I just feel as if I’m now barely recognised as an integral part of the team anymore. 

I feel as if I’m going to try and finish it up here. I should’ve slept awhile ago so I can get up early enough to get ready for work but that’s likely not going to happen now. Yay I’ll get to skip breakfast. In all seriousness though this was just me ranting, I hope someone can take this as a message to make them feel as if they’re not alone or to stop someone on their path of their own self-destruction. I feel as if I’m too far gone now so I’ll end up in one of two ways. I hope everyone looks after themselves. Stay safe.

25,"I apologize if this is the wrong sub for this kind of advice. My girlfriend of 1.5 years just told me she cut herself today and I don't know what I should do to help. She tends to just get sad sometimes, but I didn't realize the extent of it until now. Last night was similar to what tends to happen when she gets sad, we were hanging out and we were both very happy and excited at the start. We went for a walk, we were both laughing a lot, but then for no necessarily visible reason she seemed to get sad and she lost interest in really doing anything. I don't know exactly what happens when this type of situation occurs, but I think she just starts thinking about things in her mind and her thoughts begin to wear her down. I do my best to cheer her up and be there/supportive for her, sometimes I am successful but other times she just stays sad for a little but then perks up a day or so later. She talked to me about a year ago about how in high school she had tried one time to cut herself but wasn't successful. I guess I did not realize that she was still had those kinds of ideas. 

Today while texting she told me that she had tried again. I guess in a way I was a bit surprised because she had seemed better today than where things had left off last night. We had dinner together probably an hour earlier and she was in pretty good spirits then. Also she just didn’t seem as upset as she had times in the past, which made it even more surprising because I definitely would not have anticipated her trying anything today. She did say that it only ""kinda worked"" but that did not make me feel much better. I am worried, and I don't want to do anything to pressure her or make her feel worse. One of my concerns is that she will try again. I feel like that is something where once she starts it will be easier to do it again in the future, with a mentality where it won't be as hard a second time since she has already done it before. I also am concerned about trying to notice when things are wrong in the future. Like I mentioned above, I really did not think anything would have happened today because she did not seem as upset last night as she has other times in the past. When she was explaining everything to me she seemed almost casual about it and kept saying that I shouldn’t be worried, which just didn’t really sit well with me because that is not a usual reaction for her. 

If anyone has any sort of advice on what I should do I would appreciate it so much. I don’t want to overreact or underreact, and I don’t really know how to approach this with her. I am definitely going to want to check in with her more often now, but I know she doesn’t want me to think she can’t take care of herself. Thank you

29,"Hey. I know I’m just another stranger on Reddit, but I’d really like some impartial internet advice please. 

I’ve been depressed since I was 5 when my dad left, I’m in my twenties now. Quit my godawful job last week and I know I should feel happy but I just feel so anxious. Had counselling and therapy before multiple times but nothing really worked, on meds now and they work for the most part, but things have been so stressful recently it doesn’t feel like they’re cutting it at the moment. 

I don’t want to go to the interviews I’ve got lined up next week, I feel so anxious I’ve been having the worst panic attacks I’ve had in years all week. Part of me never wants to work again, I just want to curl up in a small ball and sleep for a couple months. 

But there’s another part of me that just wants to buy a flat in my city, I’ve got money for a deposit but obviously need a job for mortgage etc. and I want a dog and go for a run every morning and buy IKEA furniture and wake up early and go get coffee. 

I’m torn between the two halves of my brain and all my body wants to do is cry and sleep and I just want to not feel",03Dec2017,2,

31,"Typically, I have to take it about 12 hours before the time I want to wake up. After taking it I get tired, and fall asleep about 2 or 3 hours after taking it.  Example: Friday, I went to a show, and took it at around 2am, and ended up sleeping until 2pm.  On work days, I have to take it around 7pm, in order to wake up at 6:30am.  I hate this. I want to get down to 6 hours of sleep like most people.  I'm talking a low dose antipsychotic - 100mg Clozaril, and 300mg lithium.  Any tips to fight the drowsiness? I can't keep going like this.  I sleep too much, and because of this I pretty much have no life on weekdays.",03Dec2017,2,

33,"Hi, new to the subreddit, hoping everyone is doing well. For the past month or so i've been feeling overwhelmed,stressed and depressed. I feel as though I don't have much of a life, and most of my happiness comes from talking to my girlfriend, who doesn't live near by at the moment, as she is doing a placement year and i'm finishing my last year of university. This has started to put a lot of strain on the relationship. I suffer from pretty bad anxiety as well which i'm trying to work through with therapy. I find it hard to be motivated or enjoy anything in life at the moment. Every week or so I end up crying, either to myself or over the phone with my girlfriend. Shes tried to help but shes starting to get annoyed that i'm so negative all of the time. I'm stressed from university work, I barely do anything outside of working at home or the library and I feel as though i'm going to lose her, as she has a life at the moment with friends and work, and I feel like I have nothing. I feel as though If i lose her, it will completely tip me over the edge. I've tried to do some more things outside of just working and watching t.v but I can't find the motivation, I don't have heaps of money to do exciting things as a student, and I only have a couple of friends here who I live with. I'm also really worried that I wont be able to find a job after university. I was wondering if anyone else has been through something similar. Is this just a temporary thing because it's my last year of university? Any advice would be great, thank you :)",03Dec2017,2,

37,"Hi all, 

I'm a nineteen-year-old girl, living in the UK. I have anxiety (unspecified, but it's a bitch) and possible depression? I'm not sure. 

I've been to the doctors' a few times about it. They've offered me counselling/CBT, which I am still on the waiting list for...six months later, but hey, that's the current state of the NHS. They also offered me Prozac when I went a few months ago, but I have strong negative connotations with this drug (these feelings are perhaps unfounded). 

However, my friend is on Sertraline, and he's seen a marked improvement. I'm considering asking the doctor tomorrow about it, as I have another appointment. My reason for going this time is that in one of my episodes - a particularly bad one - I took a razor and cut my leg a few times. This scared me - not only the fact I did it, but the fact I felt so much better after doing so. Hence, I feel like I possibly need to be medicated.

But I really do fear these drugs, and I'm not sure why - I feel as though I'll be chemically altered forever, and that I'll never feel like myself again. I don't know...can anyone provide any reassurance, or whatever? I also want to enquire about the CBT, because I've been waiting since June. 

Sorry for the rambly post",03Dec2017,1,

39,"I wish I could feel the way you do,
I wish my life was not like it was,
I wish for it to be the way it was.
I couldn't help myself. The feeling felt ao familiar to my first breakdown. 
And then i said the words I didn't want to tell you. I have always been bad with feelings. It's proven by professional. I don't feel comfortable with allot of people. Why are you still here on my mind? Did you find out mu secret? My mood swings? My deppresion? Tell me, you think i'm crazy as well. 
I can't accept myseld either, sometimes.",03Dec2017,17,
40,"Hey guys
First of all, I am an introverted 16 years old boy.
I love to think and read about stuff in the universe and I feel like everything is just way too perfect to be real. I don't believe in god but I think that my current life is just a test for a life that comes after my death, therefore I think that I have been created by something beyond my understanding.
So as the title says, I have a lot of losses of reality. It's always happening when I'm around people and it feels like everyone is playing a role to let me think that life is real. If I'm in these situations, I basically lose everything I feel for my family and friends because I think they are playing a role.

It's really annoying and I'm considering to go to a psychologist but I was there once and I was lying about everything just to avoid a mental hospital because I don't want to miss school.
Thanks for reading.
What should I do?",03Dec2017,3,
41,"As I've posted before I'm slowly becoming someone else. I don't want to become this person however.  I just jammed out on my guitar for 10 minutes, and I think the dopamine release from the pleasure just pushed me further towards him..I could feel his presence...momentarily I felt good..but then when I realized the 'aura' of this other person....it was a little upsetting... I might have to not do anything I enjoy, to avoid becoming this other person.

Don't worry. I don't have DID, this is not madness so much as it is not knowing who you are.",03Dec2017,1,
