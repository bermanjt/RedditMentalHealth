1,"I have been in therapy on-and-off for almost 6 years, but I've never had it regularly because I thought I didn't need it. I'm approaching my 20th birthday and the more I've grown up, the more I've realized I have some deep-seated issues that I need to work through to have a more stable and happy life. I would like to start having weekly therapy sessions to get through my issues more thoroughly. I need something intense because I've been through a lot of trauma and its time to move on.

Problem is, most therapists can only be seen bi-weekly at best because they are constantly so booked up. I am also looking for a new therapist, someone who is more knowledgable about sex therapy and DBT, so I have a decent amount of options.

How can I get weekly appointments with a therapist, do I just flat out ask and move on if they say no, or is that an impossible request? ",27Nov2017,3
2,"I have been having these really strange brain trips, it kind of feels like extreme deja vu or like Im remembering a dream really strongly? But I can't tell if they are real memories or not, when it happens I have this strong feeling like I've got a second life thats happening and these are flashes of it? But then afterwards I know that the memories aren't real. It makes my stomach feel really sick, like when I have a panic attack so I was wondering if maybe it was a version of a panic attack?? I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this or if it's normal or just if someone could expand on whats happening to me? 
TLDR; My brain is doing strange deja vu things increasingly lately, whats going on?

4,"Recently I've noticed my overall mood going downhill, and I get agitated by every little thing that happens. I feel unmotivated to do anything, but what confuses me is that I have no reason to be feeling down, or sad. Many aspects of my life are already well off, and I have it better than a lot of people. I have no significant health, financial, education, or family issues to worry about. What gives?

Note: I highly doubt this as depression, but if it is, then it would confuse me even more as to WHY.

5,"I have Bipolar 2, depression, generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder.  My therapist thinks that my girlfriend should come to therapy with me, and my girlfriend wants to come, and is very anxious to come, but I don't really want her to.  The thing is, she doesn't know that I have very disturbing thoughts about her.  Things that I tell only my therapist.  I have them about my family too, and that's the reason that I haven't invited them to go to therapy with me.  What would you all say I do?  Or should she go to a family group therapy meeting, or should we go to a relationship therapist?  Our relationship is working fantastically, but what would you say we should do?",27Nov2017,7
6,"Hi there üëãüèª
I‚Äôm new here on this sub but I wanted to share a story and what I‚Äôve done today to see if anyone has gone through something similar.
2 years back, I had surgery and then got blood clots. I was severely depressed, lots friends, became negative, posting on social media turned into not being positive but a place where I harbored a lot of negative feelings for old friends who pushed me aside.

I wanted to deactivate my Facebook but I‚Äôve had it since about 2004/2005 when it was opened to more universities. My relationship with my spouse is on there, entire life of my child, lots of positive memories. So, I decided to do something different.

I played roller derby and would add anyone who was wearing a helmet in their picture. I was up to about 1600 friends. However, I took the time to remove a lot and now I‚Äôm at 540 Facebook friends.

Unfortunately, I do have some anxiety about being talked about, bu whatever. I feel like there is a weight off my shoulders but perhaps I can move towards positive mental health and I can work on writing a book!

TLDR: I unfriended over 1000 people on Facebook today. Have you done something similar and how did you feel? ",27Nov2017,1
7,"This is my throwaway account for relationship problems/questions. Also, I overthink shit.

My boyfriend is in his late 20s and he often comes up with very outlandish solutions for his problems. I'm not sure how much of this is him being from a different culture (he is from East Asian, I'm American, and we're in the U.S.) and how much is him.

Here's a few examples. Note: He never went through with any of the solutions, although he was serious about them:

- He absentmindedly almost used a fork to get his bagel from the toaster. Solution: Get rid of the toaster.
- He got a speeding ticket. Solution: Sell his car.
- He was at work and I wanted to use his laptop for something. He's the type who doesn't like anyone using his electronics unsupervised. Solution: Leave work to collect his laptop.

Also, he tends to come up with ideas that are clearly not just off the top of his head, but come off to me as if they were thought halfway through.

Interestingly, I've met his dad before and I think the two share a lot of their quirky characteristics (a few questionable one but also lots of good ones,) and ways of thinking, including this one. His dad also thought it was a good idea to sell his car. He calls his dad ""crazy"", so I don't dare tell him that they're actually ""crazy"" in very similar ways.

Everyone close enough to him picks up on his idiosyncrasies, too. He's pretty much the only one who's unaware that his way of thinking is somewhere in left field sometimes.

I love this guy. He's a class act who makes me very happy and works hard at his ambitions. I just want to make sure that he receives help to function better if he needs it. I see a therapist for my own issues and I really like it. I shared this briefly with her and she said he might benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy. Thing is, I don't want to make him think I think he needs professional help unless it's really likely he would benefit from it.

So my questions are: Am I making too much out of this? Do you think I should bring up the idea of seeing a therapist?

Most importantly, therapist or none, is there a way to discuss my concern with him? He has a classmate who, in a friendly way, sometimes calls him ""Crazy BF"", or says ""Typical BF"" in reply to him. BF doesn't mind but doesn't seem to understand what his classmate is referring to. I'd like to help him understand.

TL;DR: Boyfriend's solutions to life's issues are pretty overblown. Am I worrying over nothing? Might he benefit from CBT or other therapy? Is there a way for me to share my concern with him?",27Nov2017,2
8,"In the U.S. Unfortunately some of this I know first hand, much of this I'm hearing about. So my older brother is diagnosed with autism and schizophrenia. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia twenty years ago. He has been on clozapine, which has overwhelmingly worked, despite occasional relapses. Our mother said he was unbearable before being on the clozapine and would constantly be kicked out of placements. The last placement he was in, he walked away from and several miles to our house to tell our mother one of the workers pulled a knife on him. So my mom had started caring for him. This was about ten years ago.

So about once every couple years or longer, my brother would have a relapse where he would start obsessing over something odd, like the weather or Obama and it was difficult to understand exactly what his concern was. I would sit down with him and talk to him, but he was very hard to understand specifically when he was obsessing about something that upset him. After a few days or a week of this, eventually it would culminate in a large incident where the police would be called. I witnessed this happen when he banged his head on a vacuum and told the police someone else in the home had attacked him. This was NOT typical for his personality. He would go to the psychiatric hospital for a few days and come back perfectly normal and fine.

Another one of these incidents happened about a month ago where he started obsessing over something, making word soup, and he claimed to have thrown out his meds, which I guess weren't really his meds. However, the hospital sent him home without his clozapine and gave him depakote and abilify instead. For ages, my brother has insisted he doesn't have schizophrenia and said he'd been occasionally finding ways to not take his meds for a week at a time. He also claimed the hospital doesn't think he has schizophrenia and that is why they won't give him clozapine.

So for the past month, it has been a living hell. Relapses and the police arriving have gone from being a once in two years or longer event to happening at least four times in the past month. He attempted suicide twice and then has been downplaying that and everything else. He's been sleeping two hours at the most every single night. He hasn't been eating. He's been pounding on the walls and claiming he's not. He's been pacing the house. He's been making everyone anxious and on edge. Yelling and making accusations constantly. Constantly picking fights and telling me that another relative is out to get him, when I know that relative isn't. He's been telling me his contacts online who work for Google or the government are telling him this and that.

This has been out of control, and things are getting really scary. The hospital seemingly isn't taking this seriously and I have no idea what to do. I live a few states away, but my family is dealing with this every single day. What can they do?",27Nov2017,11
9,"I am always feeling like something is missing.  I can distract myself temporarily with friends, starting new relationships, vacations, mindless entertainment.  But I feel it almost every day.

The way things are not how I wanted them to be.  The problem is that I don't know exactly what I want instead, so I can't head in a specific direction.  I end up floundering around in half-decisions and doing something I think I want but end up not wanting at all and switching between choices constantly.

I don't trust myself to make a decision about my life.  I'm just waiting for the experts to tell me what's best for me.  I'm a huge coward.  I'm afraid of commitment, saying what's on my mind, failing, being wrong, taking a risk or debt, prettier girls than myself, etc.  I'm insecure, weak-willed, very lost, and kind of an asshole deep down because of my shitty neurotic or pretty bigoted beliefs.  I only like myself sometimes.

Everything feels really meaningless and empty for the most part.  I don't care about school.  I know my family does so I try to do well but I'm starting to not care enough these days to put in the effort.  I can't make friends easily.  I don't know what to do.  I know I'm not that special, but I feel so disconnected that sometimes I believe in my special snowflake self-pitying.  I want to escape.  I want to force myself into a situation in which I have to make more decisions for myself, because right now even though I am making decisions (shitty ones) I feel like none of them are real or my fault/responsibility.  I feel no urgency to take control because I live with my parents who always shielded me from consequences.  But I know I need to or I'll end up wasting my life. I think I'll just keep waiting for someone to do something for me or for something to change for me because that's how it's always been.  I'm waiting for life to give me something new, and nothing is happening.  I feel a stagnation or even a regression in my personal growth.  Not meeting anyone I really want to talk to, not feeling like anything I am learning has value or use, feeling like I'm just wasting my time with everything that I do.  I always feel a little agitated staying in one place for too long.  It makes reading hard because I'm constantly thinking that there's something more important for me to be doing.  But rarely do I feel like any of the things I do are important, since I have nothing to work for other than a fuzzy goal of ""being successful/happy"".

I am very lonely.  I also feel like I deserve to be alone because of how terrible I am.  I wouldn't want the company of myself either.",27Nov2017,2

13,I'm currently fighting with myself right now.

Ever since the girl and her friends have spread rumours I'm going to fight her now it's all coming back and I just want it to stop.

14,"To anyone reading this and willing to give advice i want to say thank you. 

I feel like i no longer know who i am. From since i was young i never felt good enough. i would always compare myself to others and then regardless of who it is i would feel inferior. 

I guess because of this i started changing who i am, but not in the way self improvement / discipline kind of way, E.g (Gym / Meditation / Reading etc.) 

I would actually start changing my deep down character. If i didn't like someone or something i would force myself to like it. If i didnt feel confident i would fake it. If i felt unhappy i would force myself to be happy. If i was feeling dumb i would force myself to try and feel smart (i usually did this by overthinking things because i thought thats what smart people did - Think) etc etc. 

I would basically have a mask on all the time and because of that i feel like i lost who i am. i have become so dependant on these masks that without them i get very anxious and stressed out especially when i am around other people. 
 
I feel like each mask has its own personality and identity and views the world differently. its gotten to the point where i feel like one mask would like a certain thing and another mask would hate that exact same thing. this varies from food, entertainment, people, hobbies and life goals. 
Ive spoken to other people about it and have seen around 4 or 5 different councillors but none of them have been particularly helpful. They leave me feeling good for a couple of days but then the same cycle begins where i start thinking about which mask / personality i should put on given the situation i am in. 
 
I have been given the advice that i should just ignore or stop thinking about the personalities. Ive tried that but i just end up feeling flat and lousy for the days that i do that. 
 
 Ive used the mask shifting / personality thing to my advantage as well though. Like there have been times where i was studying and the subject i was studying was very dry and boring to me (Accounting). So i decided to change my mask/ personality to one that i knew enjoyed the subject. And then just like i was pressing a switch i felt like a different person, and now being this new person i was able to look at my study notes and like magic i suddenly understood them and even enjoyed them. 
 
Same thing goes with food, sports and even people. I could be having a conversation with someone who i know the current personality / mask doesn't get along with too well, so i would change my personality / mask to someone i know they interact well with. It's so strange and i just end up feeling like i cant connect form a meaningful connection with anyone because our relationship depends more or less on which personality i am in. 
 
And every time i change a mask / personality i feel like a new person. So if i start the day being one personality and for some reason i change around 3 or 4 pm, i would feel like a completely different person from that point onwards. I would feel like that wasn't even me in the beginning of the day because i would no longer be in the same personality / mask. 

This has been happening for many years now - around 7ish years. and i feel its getting worse and worse and im getting more confused as time goes on. I am 25 years old now, and this is seriously holding me back 
 
If anyone has any advice on this i would appreciate it tremendously. I haven't been able to find anything else relating to what i am feeling currently and none of my councillors or therapists have been able to either. 

Even whilst writing this my personality changed and as a result my writing style changed. So i adjusted the the title because my previous personality liked it but now the current one didn't so i thought i would change it. 
 
Oh god, this is so confusing.
 
Thank you for taking the time to read this. ",27Nov2017,5

17,"I'm going to try to describe the ""abnormal"" things about me, because I've been worried for awhile now that I have some sort of disorder. I am an extreme perfectionist, enough that it's hard to take notes in class if I have to write them down quickly because my letters must look right. I also have a problem with procrastination, it's so bad that I commonly stay up until 1 AM working when I only had one assignment and nothing that night. I can't work with others, so group porjects are horrible for me because I don't think anyone will do the job well enough. I also have an extreme fear of embarrassment and rejection, and avoid large group events as I'm afraid I'll mess up and everyone will laugh at me, and I never talk to any girl I like because I'm afraid they'll reject me or I'll embarrass myself. On top of that, I remember random things from months ago that I regret doing, even though no one noticed it and it wasn't weird to them, I constantly bash myself on how stupid I was and imagine if I had just stayed inside alone all day as it would have been better than that. I don't trust other people with my feelings and prefer to just keep everything hidden. Finally, I can't lose an arguement, even if I'm wrong I keep fighting until the other person quits.

I started college last year and I've been absolutely miserable- I hate the hookup culture and drinking, haven't been able to make any friends. Not a humble brag, but I am a good looking guy so I actually got bids to frats and ended up joining one. Big mistake- I hated the culture and left- I'd get chided for not hooking up girls who tried to get with me because I have this belief that one should lose their virginity to someone they atleast care for. Being 19 I just feel so self-conscious, and after leaving the fraternity I get anxious that I will run into someone from their in public and I just tend to hide away and spend most of my time in my apartment studying or going to the gym. It's just I hear people say college is such a great time and I don't know what is wrong with me. I've asked people and they say I often don't smile much when I talk but the difficult thing is I just have a hard time smiling about most things.

31,"Got a flat tire. Tried to change it. Everything that could go wrong went wrong. It took me an hour and 2 minutes to change the tire. Finally began driving home and I was hearing a weird noise. Thought it could be because the oil leak we have so I put some oil in it. After I did that and had walked around to get back in, noticed the spare was almost flat. I tried to google the closest gas stations near me, hoping to put some air in the spare, but my phone died as soon as it told me ‚Äú5 minutes away‚Äù. So I just had to drive to where I knew there was one and the machine was out of order. I kept driving and found another one and parked. I counted all the pennies I had and had some hope when I found a quarter. I counted all my change and ended up 30 cents short. That broke me. I had already been crying but this was different and more desperate. The noise the car was making as I drove was so scary. I was afraid maybe the tire would spark or catch fire or fall apart. I was afraid the car would be completely un-drivable and I‚Äôd have no way to get home. As I was backing out of the parking space, someone honked at me and I have no idea why but it made me cry more. As I was pulling out of the parking lot, someone almost hit me because I guess I pulled out too far and I just screamed bloody murder even though they weren‚Äôt close to me. I was crying and repeating ‚ÄúI only needed 30 cents‚Äù over and over while driving home. When I finally got home I walked through the door and my husband was downstairs and all I could say was ‚ÄúI only needed 30 cents‚Äù. Over and over and over. I guess it was shock or just pure anxiety? The bad part was over but all I could say was that phrase. I was able to tell him to get our pup from the backseat of the car (I had been at the dog park when the tire went flat) but then I headed upstairs repeating the phrase. I did so for about 30 minutes. I was able to finally stop once I got out of the shower, and I stopped crying too. But I just laid in bed. 

Now I‚Äôm awake the next morning and to me, the event didn‚Äôt seem too horrible. It‚Äôs not like anyone got severely hurt, we have a warranty on the tire so that‚Äôs good. But it just makes me nervous because I never been so hopeless in a crisis. I‚Äôm so dependent on others, I guess. People give me strength. Whenever there‚Äôs an issue, I‚Äôm usually one to jump in and lend a helping hand and try to solve the problem. I was super ready to change that tire by myself but as soon as the lug nuts were too tight to get off I lost it. When the actual tire and rim wouldn‚Äôt come off, I lost it again. I tried grabbing the tire and pulling but there was metal sticking out of the tire I couldn‚Äôt see so it stabbed me and I cried like a child. 

I just can‚Äôt seem to understand how I totally lost it for about an hour and a half. It just seems like an overreaction but it makes me sad and scared for myself and anyone dependent on me (like future children) for when a crisis happens. What‚Äôs wrong with me?

40,"I'm pathetic. I've been NEET, living with my mom for 4 years. I feel stuck. So much has happened to me over this period. I've had run-ins with the police. I was put in a psychiatric hospital for a stretch of time. My ex-girlfriend almost strangled me to death. I burned all my bridges. And now, I'm dealing with this fucking disease. 

I've been fighting this madness inside my head since March 2016. I call it the ""alignment problem"". I've had signs of it all my life, but March 2016 was a particularly stressful time for me, and that's when it spiraled out of control.

For context, I've always felt that I'm not fully immersed in the present moment, like there's something I need to finish before I can truly enjoy and experience ""now"". Imagine you want to unwind, and relax, but you have to finish a work assignment, or a report, and so there's a hanging presence of unfinished business constantly following you around until you finish. That's what I've felt like all my life, like I'm not truly relaxed, because I have something I need to ""finish"" first.

This thing I need to ""finish"" has destroyed me. I describe it as an optimization process, or an alignment process. It feels like I have to straighten out my very core, and once I do, I'll be at the forefront of reality, able to live freely and relax without feeling the presence of unfinished business.

In March 2016, when I felt the urge to straighten myself out, I decided for the first time that I'd start work on this unfinished business and align myself as such. When I refer to ""alignment"", I'm often using the term in a very literal sense. Picture a dark, cavernous space, with a bubble inside it, directly located in the center. That bubble was me. I felt the urge to be fully aligned and symmetrical, in a very literal, visual sense, and if I wasn't, I wouldn't be able to move forward with my life. 

I'd often lay down in bed and visualize myself in this dark, cavernous space for hours. I needed to remember it at all times. I needed to be centered at all times. These initial visualizations led to a more ""intellectualized"" approach, where I would actually try to prove I was ""in the center"".

So it started like this...""in the center""... what does that mean, exactly, and how can I make it true? Eventually, I came to the word ""important"". If I want to be truly ""centered"", I have to become the most important person in the Universe. Not for any egotistical reason. Purely for the sake of alignment and symmetry. 

So I came up with a list of arbitrary facts about myself and the world, and tried to maneuver them into some ""grand truth"" about the Universe, so that I could prove my significance and finally become centered. Every part of me knew it was untrue and knew I wasn't universally significant, but I needed it to be true, and I practically FORCED it to be true. For days and days and weeks and months I forced myself to remember every significant fact about myself to ""prove"" that I was worthy of alignment and symmetry. 

After about 3 months of this, my consciousness was fucking rattled, almost to the extent of numerous psychedelic trips. I felt like I was off the planet. Three straight months of forcing untrue drivel into reality by repeating it incessantly to myself. Three straight months of looping thoughts, desperately trying to find my center. 

I developed derealization. My moods became incredibly erratic. Paranoia set in. I was no longer on planet Earth. 

After this period, I realized I would not be able to align myself this way, by forcing absurd truths into existence. I figured, hey, if I want to center myself, I have to center myself using facts. And so I did. I spent another four months trying to unravel the true nature of reality. I thought if I could understand the world around me, as well as morality, I'd finally be aligned and have strong justification for my actions moving forward.

Four months went by. Another long stretch of time, trying to accomplish the impossible. Trying to answer every question known to man so that I have symmetry in my life. After this, I no longer had anything to ""prove"". I was just lost. The alignment problem began to seep into every facet of my life, whether it be fitness, speaking with family and friends, organizing my home, literally everything became an issue of symmetry and balance.

Everything needed to be ""just right"". 

It was only in the summer of this year that I started to realize... Maybe there's no solution here. Maybe I'm too far gone. At this point, I'd developed severe delusions, probably stemming from all the months of obsessive thoughts and ruminations. 

And so I finally saw a psychiatrist, about a month ago. I'm apparently schizophrenic, which makes sense, but I think there's more to it than that. She prescribed me Risperdal, which I haven't really taken. I'm in a state of chaos right now. It's been nearly two years of repeating thoughts. Fucking ""alignment"". I can't take it anymore. 

Part of me thinks I shouldn't take medication, because if I force myself not to, my mind might accelerate into ""overdrive"" mode and automatically revert back to normal. I'm desperately hoping for this. I just want to go back to normal. 

I don't know why I wrote this post, frankly, but I'm now thinking of killing my ex-girlfriend. I've had thoughts like this before but this time it's real. I want to kill her, film it, and became famous for it. And then maybe I'll kill myself. I can't take these repeating thoughts anymore. I can't do it anymore. Just can't do it. I want it to end.

THAT SAID... I think this would all go away if I could just solve this fucking alignment problem. Maybe it doesn't have to end like this.

I guess what I want to ask is... does this sound like OCD to you? Would antipsychotics even help my situation? Am I so far gone it's not even worth it anymore? I've been awake nearly 36 hours and I'm struggling to see the point of living anymore. I don't know what to do. Please just help me, tell me something that will help me.

42,"I recently read somewhere that fat kids developed breasts temporarily, and it rang a bell. When I started sitting in the front seat of the car he would feel up my man tits and I guess pretend they were tits while we were on the free way.

Other then that he's been a good dad and hasn't done anything like that in 10 years, I'm 18 now.

What should I do? Do I forgive him? Do I continue talking to him? I get mad thinking about it but at the same time other then that he was a good dad. But damn disgusting. I can't go a day without thinking about it now. What should I do? Do I confront him? Will that help me get over it?

It's like my life has been on pause since this memory came back. I couldn't be more angry/confused on what to do now. I'm about to get fired from my job because I can't get my mind off it.

43,"I (23M) have been struggling with my mental health since adolescence. My parents never really cared enough to get me checked out, but I did when I lived on my own at age 18. I moved back in with my father last year after living on my own for a couple of years. He and I havent been in contact for a lot of the time in between. Now he speaks about me being a dirty and stinky in that period and also now. I have trouble working since 2 years but when I do work and earn a little money he is very negative about my work. 
How do I assert my hurt and rejected feelings and change the conversation? 

Yes I do struggle with hygiene and do my best, I also struggle with work and do my best. Of course I have bad spells, but in general I make progress over the months. I think this is pretty normal for a young person who has been living with undiagnosed mental illness for years on end. I am getting diagnosis now

Every time it absolutely ruins my day. I can‚Äôt stop crying because I feel so hurt.

I have a problem...
Why do I constantly fear that I might be wrong about everything, especially my memories? Why do I go from believing that I'll succeed in school and become a famous millionaire, to thinking I'll end up homeless and I'm completely screwed? Believing that I have the potential to have a 160 IQ and that I have the potential to speak 7 languages, to feeling like I might be extremely stupid, delusional, etc?

51,I feel so low at times I struggle to see the good side of things. I have my good times but I can't relate to them when I feel down. I'm so lonely but I feel that even if I solved that issue I will just find something else that makes life hard because I am not even grateful for what I have achieved and overcame in the past. I'll always want more I fear I'll never be satisfied with my life. I have lost interest in the things that I loved. I used be an avid gamer and now I'm lucky if I go one hour before it starts to feel like a chore. I don't really watch TV I find very little entertainment with it. I box to stay fit and have a hobby and that's all well and good whilst you're doing it and it does give you a little boost for a while. But I never know how long until I'm low again. I'm to young to be the way I am. I have a poor social life and social skills so I drink a lot because I'd only be staying at home if I wasn't.

52,"To preface this I‚Äôm 17 and currently living with my Grandmother due to complex family circumstances.

***My past***
Back about two years ago my life was completely different; I was incredibly lonely because I was removed from public school due to a complex and confusing history that combined with an equally complex and confusing home life that left me feeling suicidal every night.

I moved on with help from an online friend and a drastic change in lifestyle, but the feeling never completely went away. It was always there, admittedly in a much lower capacity, but still ever-present.

Move on two years and I‚Äôm achieving things I never thought I could - I have a healthy social life and a beautiful girlfriend that I love to bits, and I‚Äôm studying a subject that I am incredibly passionate about.

But the problems at home never stopped and recently they‚Äôre getting worse. This has caused me to completely spiral back into that dark place I tried so desperately to escape from. 

**The day***italics*
Yesterday I was invited to my girlfriend‚Äôs mum‚Äôs birthday meal, before I left I had a very big argument with my grandmother who is also the main been the main cause of my suffering for these past few years. The entire day I played it cool and cracked jokes, laughed and tried to make a good impression on my girlfriend‚Äôs extended family, but the entire time I felt like I was literally about to burst into tears.

**The night**
When I finally got back home there was no one in so I got settled. About ten minutes after coming in I got a text from my girlfriend along the lines of: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry about today, it was your first time meeting them.‚Äù I replied with something similar to: ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt worried until now, did do something wrong?‚Äù She replied with: ‚Äúnext time say goodbye to my parents.

It turns that when I left early to catch a ride I decided to not interrupt a funny conversation her parents where having and simply asked her to thank her parents for me and wish her mother a happy birthday. This apparently mildly offended her mother which was beyond me.

This sent me over the edge, I spent the entire day getting to know her entire extended family when I was in deep emotional pain. There was of course no way for them to know that but it still didn‚Äôt help me.

I began venting to my girlfriend about my feelings and she became very alarmed. At the time I didn‚Äôt want to answer the phone to her because I was in a state of what I can only describe as frantic sadness and anger. I knew that if I answered the phone I would blame her for sending me over the edge and likely burned a few bridges I have worked very hard to construct.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong I treat this girl like a princess because I love her so much. She has a bad history of boyfriends taking advantage of her and emotionally neglecting her. I try to be the exact opposite ‚Äî I meet her parents, make friends with her little sister and nieces, take her out on social dates and remind her that I love her all the time. 

But in this specific situation she unintentionally sent me over the edge with the what I view as incredibly unfair comment from her parents. I angrily explained my issues and she listened keeping in mind my entire past I touched on in the beginning of this post. She was very supportive and made me feel better quite quickly. She is obviously not equipped to properly support me through these times alone and I worry that I am becoming an emotional burden.

She came to the conclusion that I must have depression advised that I speak to a doctor, but that is not really preferable in my current living situation because if my guardian finds out about my issues they will make things worse for me.

**My current living situation***italics*
My Grandmother comes from a background of domestic violence and decades on she is incredibly hard to live with and is the main reason I feel like this. She is incredibly kind and would give you shirt off her back if you needed it, but she is also a lying, manipulative aggressor that makes me feel horrible about existing on the daily.

On the surface she is a sweet old woman that does everything but on the inside she is a narcissistic control freak. She often buys me expensive gifts for birthdays and Christmases, but I don‚Äôt ask for them. I‚Äôve learned that she does this to have something to make you feel guilty about - she buys you an expensive present you didn‚Äôt ask for, then proceeds to try and control and emotionally abuse you daily, and when you rebel she throws up the unwanted gifts in your face and paints you as the bad guy to everyone else.

I am completely stuck; reasoning with my grandmother is impossible, but my parents are more than happy to let me move in with them but they are in severe financial difficulties and that just seems like another environment I don‚Äôt want to be dealing with daily.

**Conclusion / TL;DR***italics*
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm depressed or not, my girlfriend seems to think so. I have no job or income to move out on my own, my parents are in extreme financial trouble so I can‚Äôt live with them and my current living situation is making me want to kill myself. What should I do?",27Nov2017,1
54,"Hey guys. I'm using a throwaway for this one, but I honestly don't know where to turn at this point. I feel like im in a nightmare where no one is listening to me and I'm screaming for help. Im from California. 

For context, i've been feeling this way for about 5 years. I've had some family trauma with my Dad passing away and being sent away to a gay conversion camp to try and get me rehabilitated. I was sexually assaulted while there and was taken home soon after, and went to therapy for about a year before stopping. 

During high school I would engage in a lot of attention seeking attitudes and would try and make friends, go to parties, and try and escape from my issues. During this time I would have a problem with skipping around friend groups because I was ""bipolar"" and I would have problems with taking social queues. 

After High school I started at a community college by me, and for the first two semester I had trouble focusing. Towards the end of the semester and would lose motivation easily. I resorted to getting my Medical Marijuana card so I could help alleviate some of the anxiety, and it seemed to work. Obviously I had to be highly motivated and driven to not get lazy and become a stoner, but i managed pretty well. 

Up until a few months ago things were fine. However, around 8 months ago I started experiencing panic attacks. I would go to sports events and whenever I would compete, I would occasionally hyperventilate and then eventually break down in the bathroom crying. I'm never usually like this, and the attacks are becoming more and more frequent. 

I feel as if im suffering an uneasy amount of paranoia and feeling as if im sick, or as if im dying of some disease. The slightest things scare me and if I see an article about car crashes, or something of that nature, I feel almost petrified the moment I get behind the wheel. I've stopped smoking to try and alleviate the stress as I thought there was some kind of correlation, but so far no such luck. 

Around 3 weeks ago i felt as if I was hallucinating small things happening. I felt as if people were in my room, and felt that I heard sounds that wernt there. I would ask my boyfriend if he heard a plane or helicopter outside, but nothing was making noise. I felt like there was things in the food I ate, such as poison or like bugs etc, weird stuff. I don't know if this goes under hallucinations but I feel a sense of being unattractive and ugly even though in my mind I know im not. I feel as if there are two voices in my head telling me one thing or another on a given day. This is the primary cause of drama between me and friends, family, and relationships.

I became paranoid that the world was ending and that it was only a matter of time before I died. I would skip classes if I heard about shootings, and if I went to class I could not focus and would just panic. Things are getting worse and I feel as if im ready for a psychotic break. I just want someone to tell me what to do. My family doesnt listen to me because they just think its me being eccentric and just different, but I know or at least believe theres something wrong.

After an intentional overdose a few weeks ago I have had a few home visits from a CAMHS Crisis team and I'm now waiting to see a counsellor/therapist (apparently early to mid december.) while I understand that that's probably a good thing and I do need the help however my main concern is that I'm going to end up doing what I did with the crisis team and default to ""Yep I'm fine, no problems here"" while in reality it's the opposite and the only time I managed to tell something resembling how I felt was immediately after the OD. Any advice is appreciated and i don't mind answering questions if you need to.
