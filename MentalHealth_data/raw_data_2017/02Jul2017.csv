I received a message earlier tonight, and then called"" K"" back. She was displaying all of the classic panic attack symptoms, along with many methamphetamine od symptoms (unable to locate pulse, difficulty breathing, chest pain/tightness, high temp).  Her current bf was out on a drug deal, and obviously unable to provide any assistance atm. 


It's so difficult trying to do anything over this amount of distance. I (while on speaker phone) contacted every common contact I could think of, including her mother and ex  bf(who is how I met her to begin  with)While simultaneously trying to to talk her into checking herself into her local er.

I'm just going nuts trying trying to think of anything else I could have done differently. I know I did everything right, but it's still gnawing at me. ",02Jul2017,1

11,"Hi, I'm a male 23 year old from Los Angeles, CA.
I'm a furry, and also a nudist, and love game design and programming and am pretty good with it.
I've also been diagnosed with asperger's syndrome, but people who talk to me don't even notice the symptoms or anything off about me anymore due to plenty of therapy and training and practice. I'm hyper empathetic sometimes to my own detriment, and a perfectionist. My myer-briggs personality type is INFP (at least all the times I took the test it was) and I'm bisexual and have a loving, supportive boyfriend who was originally a fan of my artwork I met online and eventually in person. 
For the most part, like most furries, I'm very liberal and open about sexuality, and I actually do practice nudism at home. it's how I'm most comfortable and I am truly lucky to have supportive and understanding people around me that'll let me be me. My mom, my boyfriend, a furry artist in his 30s with a loving fiance who I look up to, my closest friends all know about what I'm about to talk about and say I'm fine, but I still wanna see if any professionals can give me their opinions as well if they are so inclined.

I've always wanted to know professional opinions. For the uninformed, lolis are anime girls with childlike appearances and oodles of neoteny, sometimes even fictional children around the ages 11 - 16. I seem to really like naked lolis for their softness, cuteness, general aesthetic, and I'm also a nudist that enjoys nude art. But... there's a sexual aspect to it as well, and I always worry what it means, because my brain sometimes feels like I can find something to be cute and aesthetically pleasing while also liking it in a sexual way. But I don't (consciously) view sex or nudity as a bad thing, and as two separate concepts. I'm also attracted to lolis, but not real children or anything like a real child.... I've been a victim of molestation and the very idea of someone creeping on an actual child makes my stomach turn.
I usually don't fantasize about adults or bigger people doing things to them, that kills it for me because I think about the psychological trauma I know firsthand that such things cause. I do, however, just like to imagine them naked in a very non-sexual way, it feels comfortable and nice. Or exploring their sexuality in an innocent, consentual way, usually with objects or siblings/friends their own age or other things. I also enjoy the old joke about 1000 year old goddesses or whatever with the soft exterior of a childlike body or something, because it makes them as intelligent and mature as an elder being while still being soft and cute. I like the idea of them being empowered badasses too, maybe with some kind of magic or something. I really like the ideas of different nymphs and spirits and demons like this.

But... that's the thing, I like my cute little anime/furry girls, their actual canon age makes no difference to me, I just like the cute aesthetic of a smooth, young female body (and sometimes male). 
But I still like more mature looking characters like a powerful, fit lady or a cute, natural male with a bit of a belly/""dad body"", and slightly chubby girls, and also lolis with boobs and wide hips like an adult. I think it's more the cute factor and the neoteny than the actual age or whatever, because I find actual kids annoying and ugly. I don't hate children, but I don't like being around them because of this internal conflict in my head worrying that I might do something innocent and harmless and have it perceived as creepy (a problem a lot of autistic people had to deal with growing up, I still feel horrible for stalking a girl I liked in middle school), as well as not seeing myself as the most responsible adult and not a very good role model. I'm kinda a pushover with kids that aren't my own as well, since I don't know how their parents would address/discipline them and I don't want to step on any toes. 

But when I view them, even though I know it's quite different from being a pedophile, I still feel like one. I still feel guilty, and sad that if I ever admit I like this, I'd be lumped in with one, especially since I live in the USA. I know, since I've taken a bit of psychology myself, that my like of lolis itself isn't unhealthy since it's something that doesn't exist in real life nor do I expect it to, and it's not like I only like lolis, I like lots of body types both male and female. (I'm happy with my boyfriend in real life though, he's a cutie)

I suppose the fact that lolis are illegal in places like the UK, and the fact that the USA is kinda obsessed and paranoid over pedophiles also doesn't help.... 

Am I OK? Is it just my self esteem issues and social stigmas again, or am I right to feel what I like is wrong?",02Jul2017,2

22,"First of all, I came to reddit because idk anyone here and I don't like to post shit like this on my Facebook or Snapchat or anywhere someone I know will find out who I am on the inside. So there's that.
I think I'm extremely bipolar and I've hit a sadness streak. I really hate it because I know I'm not even close to starting my period (only other reason I feel the most sad/emotional). They say the highs are high and the lows are low and I'd like to take a moment and confirm this theory. 
I'm back in the lows, I've lost motivation and interest in exercise, going back to school, my relationship and basically all the amazing things my life has to offer. I recognize this. I hate it. I know I'm in love with my s.o.. I know I enjoy and need school to move forward and I miss exercise.

What really gets me down is the fact I have a child I don't get to see. He is precious and one of the main reasons I want to better myself. 
I'm crippled by the fact my ex is a fucking dipass and loves punishing me by allowing absolutely no contact.
The pain feels overwhelming right now and idk how to pull myself back up.

I start Rituxan again tomorrow. It's supposed to be okay for me to work at my desk job after a few days but last time I had it I worked a manual labor job and I was on disability for months. I just am so nervous and so, so afraid. 

Last time I had this I remember it feeling like my bones were breaking. I remember feeling so terrible for so long and now this treatment is much more aggressive than it was previously so I'm extra nervous. Please send positive vibes. ",02Jul2017,4

40,"Disclaimer: This could literally be dehydration and heat but just asking for some opinions. 

Went running about three weeks ago after having stopped Zoloft. It was hot outside and my body just would not go into its proper breathing. No biggie. Just took the rest as a walk. 

Started Celexa and just felt kind of tired and sluggish and not hungry. This Thursday was the first time I went back to a class at Orange Theory. I knew the workout was going to suck because I hadn't been in a month. I was yawning throughout the entire thing. Not because I was tired but because I couldn't reach the bottom of my lungs and that seemed to be the only way. 

Fast forward to today. Hot day, went running with my boyfriend and again, my body wouldnt go into overdrive, but I just pushed and pushed hoping it would break. Halfway through, my chest just seized up. I've never had asthma in my life but I was full-on wheezing. I started to cry with disappointment and worry. My boyfriend very calmly (former firefighter at work) took me to shade, sat me down, and asked me about everything. 

My heart rate was through the roof per my Fitbit. My chest was tight. I could only seem to fill up half my lungs. Once at home it took a good 15-20 minutes lying on the floor with my feet up, drinking water, and trying to stop crying, to get my heart rate down and breathing semi-normal (good guy for sitting right next to me researching the Celexa side effects). Even now though, two hours later, I still feel like my full lung capacity doesn't exist unless I reach for it. 

I stopped Paxil about two years ago after randomly racing heart beat and sharp chest pains. 

My only hesitation before blaming this on the SSRI is that I ran three weeks ago off the SSRI and had the same-ish issue. 

Has anybody else come in contact with this issue and have you solved it/how did you solve it? 

Thanks so much in advance.

41,"Ive been to lots of them and they all fall into 2 categories, ""therapists"" who cant give me medicine and have lots of weak advice and ""doctors"" who spend 5 minutes checking off symptoms on the list of drugs they're pushing before sending you to the pharmacy. Is there anyone I can go to that will actually listen to me and also give me medicine?",02Jul2017,11
43,"I guess in other words, at what point does the way you feel/act become ""bad enough"" to go see a doctor, a therapist, something? Because what if it's all in my head, and there's really just nothing wrong with me at all and I'm blowing it out of proportion?

I've always been kinda moody and irritable, even when I was little. It wasn't bad enough where I'd become a ""bad kid,"" but I would get angry and lash out at my family a lot, especially my parents. This continued and now I'm in college. I guess what's really bothering me is that my family just came to visit me in the city where I attend college before summer school starts. I was really upset about this, for lots of different reasons, but the point is that I just spent the whole week they were here upset and sort of lashing out at them. But then right after they left, I just started breaking down crying and I'm really not sure why, since I was just waiting this out until they left, wasn't I?

But there are some other things too... Whenever I do/say something embarrassing or wrong, etc, I obsess over it and I can't stop thinking about it. It's all I'll talk about for the next couple hours to my boyfriend, worrying about what others will think, until the point he gets fed up with me talking about the same thing for the last 6 hours and then I'll just keep quiet and think about it to myself. When I'm really upset I shut down and I can't seem to say anything, just sit there in silence, or when I'm really stressed it seems like it's harder for me to breathe. But is this all in my head?

I've had thoughts about killing myself, how easy it would be, different ways to do it, but I know I would never really attempt to do it. At that point, am I just thinking about it just to think about it and it's not alarming? Does everyone think about these things?

And it's not that I'm never happy, because I am. It just seems that negative things seem to impact me way more than other people and sometimes I'll be upset over weird things and when asked why I'm upset, I find that I can't really give a good reason why.

There are some other things, too, but I think these are the ones that come to mind first. I guess I'm not really sure if these things mean anything at all, or if I'm just a moody person/asshole and it's all in my head, or if everyone else is like this, too. And I guess even if no one really has any feedback for me or anything to say, at least I was able to get this off my chest and type it out. Because I've never really told anyone about these things before.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your replies, I really wasn't expecting this many! This community is so nice and supportive.. I think I may look into going to see someone at my university first and going from there.",02Jul2017,5
