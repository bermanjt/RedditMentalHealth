0,"We used to text a lot outside of therapy. Mostly it was just chatting, but we became very close.

Since counselling finished she said we could keep in touch, however we barely contact one another now.

She text me two days ago saying: ""hi how are you?""
I replied ""Hi not good, how are you?""
She hasn't replied. This is not the first time she's ignored my texts.

She knows my life has fallen apart. I don't understand why she texts me to tell me how good her life is, but she doesn't want to hear how I'm actually doing. I have been suffering erotic transference for her the past 2 years and it just hurts me that our relationship has degenerated into this. ",16Oct2017,0,
1,"Hi. So I’ve been having the severe physical symptoms of anxiety for a couple of weeks now. Racing heart feelings, gasping for air, feeling like my insides are being squeezed, feeling cold and other things. 

I don’t have feelings of impeding doom or fear, so I finally went to the ER today (Sunday) to make sure it wasn’t actually something physical, and it wasn’t. 

But I don’t know what to do. My benzodiazepines aren’t touching this, I can’t take antidepressants because they give me psychotic symptoms and make me mad, and I just don’t know what to do anymore!

Any suggestions? Am I missing something that I could be doing?

2,"I don’t really know where to post this so hopefully this is the right place. I don’t want to diagnose myself but I’ve been struggling with disordered eating and an overall obsession with food and losing weight. Along with this I feel like I could have depression or anxiety. I wanted to try and get help before I develop a full on eating disorder but I don’t have insurance and can’t really afford therapy so I made an appointment with a counselor at my college. 

The appointment is tomorrow and I just want to cancel it for a couple reasons. 1. I don’t know the difference between therapy and counseling and I feel like counseling won’t be good enough. 2. I don’t even know where to start talking and I don’t know if I can talk about my problems with a stranger 3. If I fix my eating habits I’ll stop losing weight and I don’t want that 4.

Has anyone here ever tried it, and what was your experience? Did it help?

4,"Hi there. I'm in threrapy because I was traumatized by a verbally abusive grandmother. She is a manipulative person. My family frequently discussed topics such as their illnesses that I wish they didn't. On Thursday, I had weird realizations of how I became depressed at the age of 15 and why it happened. Then I gained some experience of clarity and made sense of the full story, it was oddly relieving. Unfortunately, yesterday I went to confront my family in another city and I ended up re-traumatizing myself. Actually, I did not know my grandma would arrive there. Is it serious? Should I be getting back to where I was a week ago to release difficult memories once again? How can knowledge of these exact memories help? Now I do realize I probably have a compulsion to ""confront"" my family. I regret going on that trip and I realize my curiosity was so misguided, it's a real lesson.

Most of my brain tells me that I am wasting my time with her but the other 5 % of me thinks that if I do not try something then I am not putting forth effort.  I have been on a roller coaster of emotions lately but I am frightened by the prospect that I may be stalking her. I found myself today driving to her house for the second time since we broke up . I waited for her. I had no idea what I wanted or what I intended to do. I was so emotionally torn that I could not bring myself to leave. When she came home I knocked on her door. I basically begged her like a pitiful wretched creature. I was scared, vulnerable , humiliated by waiting and by the discussion. I know breakups are supposed to be difficult but I feel like I am escalating here and not getting better. I am in therapy and it does not work for me.

Basically, about a year ago, I was struggling with some stuff regarding my religion. I went to my church for help and they referred me to a counseling center they run. Now this center has licensed professionals. They have the ability to diagnose and treat mental illness, but they do so from a religious standpoint. 

So the dude I saw had a session open the day I checked with the Center, so I saw him that day. I went back for probably 10 sessions, once a week, despite feeling like it wasnt for me after about 3 weeks. I gave it a shot to see if itd go somewhere. At about week 4, the counselor says, ""I think you have OCD. You know, we have the ability to either give you medication or help you through therapy."" I told him I wasnt sure. He said, ""Go home, read about it and tell me what you think."" I did.

I came back the next week and said I thought if anything I had Pure O, but I still wasnt sure. We didnt really talk about it after that. So my question is, was that an official diagnoses? Hes a licensed Marriage and Family Counselor/Therapist, but thats it. According to my understanding, theres a Psychologist there who administers testing for mental illness, but I never saw her. Im just not sure if his word was enough? I'm thinking about joining the military and Im a bit confused. Any help would be appreciated.

15,"I feel so fucking empty, I don't think I'm capable of loving my family, I mean I just don't feel any love towards them or anyone. I used to be depressed but I don't really remember what it feels like because my ability to PROPERLY feel any emotion other than anger is kinda damaged. Whenever I feel any emotion other than anger it feels incomplete, like there is always something missing, these emotions always lack depth and vividness, sometimes I feel like I'm going fucking insane because of that dullness. I can't think clearly, I am always overthinking things, it makes me incapable of doing even the simplest of tasks. I dropped out of high school and a year later I dropped out of college after a term. I dropped out of college because I felt like I didn't belong there. The people there were very nice and everything but I really felt like I had to distance myself from them, because when I'm around people I feel like my inner self is starting to fade away and my inner voice getting quieter. I kinda feel bad for the people I pushed away because they tried really hard to be friends with me. I was a fucking piece of shit to them, they kept trying to be nice and I just pushed them away. I don't plan on going back to college because I have got my own plans. The problem is just that I cannot act on them because every time I try to my brain gets overwhelmed by my thoughts and I can't think straight, anytime I try to do something or even think of something that is important to me my mind just gets overwhelmed by my thoughts. It's like being in a state of confusion and restlessness. It kinda feels like being able to see all the seemingly limitless possibilities of life from a prison cell. Everything is just so close but so unreachable from that tiny, dingy, run down cell. I'm trapped in my own mind. Sometimes I just think about ending it, it seems like the only way out. I get this strange feeling that this is my destiny and that it was always supposed to happen. But I can't end it like that because it would get me nowhere. I just hope someday I will be at peace with my mind.
I wrote this because I desperately wanted someone to listen to what I had to say. I've never really had a chance to express my thoughts or feelings to anyone because my filter prevents me from doing so, and even if I didn't have a filter the people around me wouldn't understand or even listen.

I'm writing this post because I might need help and have problems talking about them to people, so this might be the right place to get this out of my head for the first time. 
Right now I'm hiding in the bathroom, because when my roommate finds out I'm still here and not at the University, she is going to tell my girlfriend, this continues to my family and this would cause some problems for me. 
Today would have been my first day in University with my new courses. I finished school in 2015 and changed what I'm studying every semester since then. 
When I started the first time, I did my best but after a few weeks i stopped visiting, because every time I have to go to University or somewhere else, it is a huge overcoming and mostly after a few weeks it just feels like to much and I stop attending. In the other 2 things I tried to study I just attended once or twice, because it felt like ""the easier path"" not to go there. 
This time I really wanted to attend, give my best and be a good student, but with every day, the beginning of the semester came closer it seemed like a bigger task for me to attend. 
And now I'm here, hiding in the bathroom and lying to people I like, that I'm at University. 
I visited a therapist once, and told him something about this, but my health insurance did not want to pay it, and now it seems even harder to try and contact another one. 
Acutally I'm not even sure why I wrote it, but it was a good feeling getting this off my chest at least once.

She/he is like cancer killing the mood with her I don't want to live stuff

She has no friends and is a terrible person. We've had to move houses 8 times because of delusionary disorder and the mistaken belif 'they've been here' 'they're watching us'

----&gt; he/she so I call her cancer because everytime I see her I jsut get an instant bad mood, something is always wrong, something is always bad, someone is always hated.

So he/she has nothing to do I say GO TO THE GYM (I hate the gym)   USE THE INTERNET (you wont show me how, I have work plus I've shown her at least 30 times in the last 3 years how the internet works) GO SEE A MOVIE (not by myself) I HATE LIVING HERE (go move somewhere else) WELL FIND ME SOMEWHERE ELSE I DON'T KNOW (back to the I don't know how to use the internet defense

This negatively is from my parent is making me utterly miserable. She is oblivious to my own problems and when I almost killed myself through morbid obesity she basically was at work and couldn't give a damn.

I am now in the prime of my life and I feel I am being held back. WINNING is impossible it's always my fault. It's my fault when I am sleeping LOL because I am tired from work.

I get mad so hence this angry post it's my only day of out of 6 today and I can't even watch family guy without the crazy horse asking me to do all the banking and kicking stuff around in the laundry.

RIGHT so the problem is they say distinguish the illness from the person BUT he/she IS HER ILLNESS 100% OF THE TIME, from the moment her eyes awake it's endless complaining and blaming.

I want to use the TV he/she shuts her door because 'cant' sleep when someone watchs TV, cat poos because he couldn't get out, my fault for watching TV.

I hatehe/she eso much. She routinely screams in the middle of the night but after 5 straight years of this all I can manage these days is shut up and go to hospital. It's groundhog day every day, it's 100% serious mental illness, I am 100% unwilling and most of all unable due to my own problems to deal with this situation hence my lack of empathy. EVEN if I did show empathy just more deflections and more blame.

Needless to say he/she has 5-6 brother/sisters is in regular contact with 0 of them, has no friends which he/she constantly complains about it ""overlooks the bit where all he/she does is complain, be miserable and criticise other people as a reason for having no friends""

ANYWAY end rant, Im just so much happier away from the only parent I have left, she is negative cancer.

35,"If you’ve used a computer for any period of time, at some point you’ll have seen the infamous BSOD, the Blue Screen Of Death.  This generally happens due to a lack of resources, or a conflict between operations attempting to use the same piece of memory. Ultimately, it’s a computer getting into a situation which it cannot “think” it’s way out of in a rational, binary, way. 
Now imagine if that happened to your brain, your mind. Insufficient resources to deal with the request, you may have seen that as a computer user. Unfortunately, the mind doesn’t generate error messages, it would be fucking handy if it did, at least then one could diagnose issues with slightly more certainty. 
It happened to me a few weeks ago, I ran out of resources, mentally. I guess you can call it a nervous breakdown, a collapse, or any other term for just hitting the wall, having nothing left. There was a definite moment when things came to a head, and it’s the most ridiculous of things. I woke at 0400 needing a pee, so got up and went to the bathroom, in the dark, walking through the dining room to the kitchen I stepped on a slug. Quite what a slug was doing in my dining room, I’ve no idea, but I stepped on it none-the-less, getting slug between the toes of my right foot. It was foul, utterly foul. I washed my feet and went about going to the loo and heading back up to bed, but I was awake now, fully awake and began to fall into a deep, deep, fug. By 0900 I knew that I was in a bad situation and made a call to the doctors for an appointment, fortunately they agreed to see me the following morning.  
I wrapped myself in a duvet and fell into catatonia. I had nothing left. 
I’m still trying to understand exactly what led me to that particular moment, where something so, seemingly, innocuous, could trigger a collapse. I guess it was the stereotypical straw to the camel’s back.  
And now, several weeks down the line, I’m sat looking at the future and attempting to understand where I go now, waiting for several referrals to run their course, for the triage from a variety of services to kick into action. 
It’s at this point where people begin to recommend soul searching, examining your life, thinking about yourself.  It’s a great piece of advice, I’m sure it is, but after a life of, whilst perhaps not appearing to, attempting to please other people, it’s somewhat tricky to spin the lens inwards. In fact, I find it damn near impossible. 
To use another comparison, imagine standing in the centre of a maze, a large and complex maze, picture the scene, not a desolate space, but not the most inviting of environs. You can see that there are ten routes out of the centre of the maze, you know that each of those routes will have potential to be the exit, to have the answers. You also know that exploring the routes, even those which aren’t the exit, will provide insight into the construction of the maze, perhaps even an impression of the architect of the labyrinth. With an open mind, ready to accept whatever may come next, you attempt to use one of the exits, but there’s a problem, you don’t know how to walk.  You don’t know how to walk. 
You’ve no idea how to walk. 
And typing that makes my shoulders fall and my brain heavy.  I know that I am in a very different place to that which I was a few weeks ago, I’m not catatonic, for a start, but I also know that I am a very, very, long way away from where I need to be. 
Another cliché is the whole “I need to find myself” deal. It’s true, I do need to find myself, but, much like not being able to walk, I’ve no idea where to look to find myself. 
I’m sure, if I were able to start traversing the twists and turns of the maze, I’d begin to find parts of me, but as it stands, I can’t walk and I’m wearing blinkers. 
Looking back to this happening before, about two years ago, I’m conscious that things build to a certain level, almost being manageable, until a trigger point is hit which pushes me “over the edge”, I do wish I could write without such cliché. That trigger point seems to be a very variable thing, but generally there is a point of high stress, prior to a final act which serves as the tipping point.  I’m certain that part of my journey forwards is developing an ability to spot these triggers in advance and not, as I have done in the past, forget about it and let my guard down. It’s all too easy for me to think that I’m ok, I’m great at papering over the cracks and just cracking on with life, but it leaves a terrible, unfulfilled, emptiness beneath it which sits in wait, like a man-trap in a forest.
I don’t know what the next step is, a lot of recommendations have come for talking therapy, so I’ll see what the NHS has to offer in the coming months. I’m conscious that there is a very big stress point coming up in a week, my daughter is going in for some substantial surgery, I know that it’s going to be hard and I know that I’ll deal with it via autopilot, and can only cross my fingers that I’ll be strong enough to pull myself through it.

He's been to countless of therapists and none of them have worked, he is currently taking the strongest anti-depressants his heart can handle.

Okay, so maybe it sounds a little extreme and probably, but I'm looking to completely nullify any personal feelings towards an ex-friend.

Basically, I kinda fucked up and started flirting with his ex a little, came to him and apologized + completely stopped talking to her days before (told her it wasn't gonna happen which I feel bad about but alas), but a couple of days later he flipped out and said i was shit and didn't want me in his life anymore. Couple of weeks later I tried reaching back out again, only for him to tell me he doesn't care about anything I have to say, making me mad and petty and say shit that was probably a little too far (he is a narcissist, has emotional abuse issues, etc.). I think the end result was a diss track about me but it's ambiguous so idk.

My point is, I see myself constantly snooping their social media comparing myself and wondering what they're doing. I know they aren't talking about me (...at least anymore), but why do I still feel so paranoid? I took a break from social media, but now I'm super apprehensive to get on because I fear that I'm gonna do something stupid like try to reach out again.

This wouldn't be the first time someone has cut me out/made me feel like the bad guy, but either I wasn't actually in the wrong or I was a huge ass and we ended up making up in the long term.
Is there maybe a mental issue/block as to why I keep doing shit like this? I hate feeling super anxious about this and I feel as if it's the reason I don't get anything done.

Guess I'm not used to be vehemently disliked. I'm 25M and was a little sheltered so idk.

These things lead me to various suicide attempts, hospitalizations, medication, and therapy (almost all of which occurred after High School). In the brief time since graduation, I have become very self aware of my situation. I am also very rational and logical - which shows that when I begin to 'rationalize' and make 'logic' from my ANTs (automatic negative thoughts) I'm not okay. This specific issue is something I've been dealing with for some time.
By now, it probably sounds like I know 'everything' going on with me. Honestly, to some degree, I probably do. I mean, what, with all the therapy I've been through... I'm striving to get better after all this but I've come to find that just KNOWING what's going on, how it came to be, and ideas on how to fix it don't actually FIX the problem. It's just self awareness.
Today I had therapy. It was perhaps one of my most emotional sessions, as so many things came to the surface. In the end, I am fixated on the thought of, ""What do I deserve? Nothing. What do I value? I have no right. Where do I want my life to go? I don't have a fricken clue."" I've said before that, ""I've forgotten how to live for myself because I'm living for others.""
So, in short, I'm not really okay right now. I'll likely send this post to the Mental Health subreddit as this CLEARLY centers around my mental state. However, what's going on mentally is affecting my entire current financial disposition. More-so, questions of where I'm going/should go in life are up in the air. I shall stress.
I. Have. No. Idea.
Okay, well, there are Ideas, but they aren't mine. In fact, the ONLY idea I have right now - far fetched as it may be - is to ""run away"". And by ""run away"" I essentially mean packing up and moving somewhere - anywhere - else. Get away from the toxic environment where it all began and start elsewhere. This would be an insanely risky move with my financial and emotional state as there is always the question of, ""Will I be able to pick myself up again in an entirely new environment and get a job/apartment/be self sustainable?""
That is the only idea I have right now. I feel like I'm going through a grinder, one ticking by at a snails pace. I'm being raked head to toe in real and self-assumed expectations of my life and how I'm supposed to live it.
Will recovery really only come from scrapping what money I have together and up and ""running""?
Why is this my instinctive ideal decision?
If this is a viable choice, how do I go around making it? How do I begin?
What subreddits are available for people that seek a long distance move (within the USA)?
Should I stay?
I know you can't tell me what to do but input would be wonderful... because I have no idea where to go from here, and trying to figure out where/who I want to be... I didn't think it'd be this hard.

51,"I don’t get how I could have two major personality disorders at the same time or really know what either one is. I wanted to ask but she kind of rushed me out as is her nature. She’s a pediatrician, not a psychologist. She has been my doctor since birth, so I trust her evaluation. She said to look up which psychologists my insurance covers and give her a list. 

Anyway, assuming she is correct, what does it mean to have those two things at once ",16Oct2017,4,
52,"Posting on a throwaway cause my main account is pretty active. Lately (last 2/3 years) I've been getting more and more afraid of ending up without friends. I'm 31 years old and in a loving relationship and have a reasonably large group of friends. 

However, the last few years a lot of my friends have gotten different hobbies, started working and making other (work-)friends. This has fed into a fear of loneliness. I also notice that having a full time job contributes to this since I rarely have time/energy to go out and meet up with them. This has let to some neglect on my part of the friendships.

Im also noticing that I find it becomes harder and harder to contact them since it feels like im being intrusive in their lives. I may have some anxiety issues that may or may not be caused by losing a parent in my early teens. This excarbates the problem.

Im wondering if anyone else has had these issues and how you learn to cope with them.",16Oct2017,1,

55,"My mind keeps speeding thoughts by one after the other and it just keeps coming more and more. I'm trying to get work done but it's difficult to focus on simply reading and learning. I'm so fidgety and it feels like my mind is going to explode. It's too rapid and idk what to do.

If anyone has any tips on how to make it easier I'd appreciate it.",16Oct2017,2,

60,"I’ve always suffered from depression and anxiety, but for the past few days, I’ve been feeling really out of it. I feel tired, clumsy, and have trouble reading and have slurred speech. It almost feels like my brain just isn’t working sometimes, like I’ll be talking to someone and I’ll mess up my words. It’s embarrassing.

I’m on 5mg Lexapro and have been for about 2 months. I don’t eat the healthiest of foods, but I try to eat less calories than I used to. I drink nothing but water, and drink lots and lots of it all day, resulting in having to urinate quite frequently. The weather has been pretty dull for the past week, but the sun has finally come out today, and I still feel dull and out of it.

I used to smoke weed almost every day, but stopped about a few months ago. The brain fog I’m feeling now feels like the type of burnt out feeling I’d get after smoking weed for like a week straight. I don’t want to feel like this anymore though. It’s affecting my work and it’s becoming hard to socialize. I feel out of place. ",16Oct2017,6,
61,"So, yeah. As the title states, I finally had an appointment with a psychiatrist for the first time in years today. When I was around 18, I was told I was ""probably bipolar"" as a blanket diagnoses from my family doctor. I was put on medication and felt forgotten about. Things got worse and worse, until I couldn't take it anymore, and finally today I had an appointment with an actual specialist who came to the conclusion that I have: 

Panic Disorder, 
Borderline Personality Disorder, 
and 
Persistent Depressive Disorder 

Does anyone have experience with these? She perscribed me new medication for the depressive disorder, and suggested I read books for the Borderline disorder....is that really all that can be done? I feel like the symptoms from the borderline are what rule my life, though the depression is all encompassing....",16Oct2017,1,

63,"“I have a dream………..”

Since I started blogging one of the things I have always desired is to be able to help other people. I thought training to become a therapist would be the answer, unfortunately it was not. I still wish I could complete my hypnosis training as I do believe it to be a good tool in helping people with mental health problems, but it is only one tool and not a good all around tool. They say that all hypnosis is self hypnosis, I agree, you have to want to believe in the therapy....................",16Oct2017,1,
