1,"Hey everyone, 

New to this subreddit. I was looking for some insight into something I have noticed about myself lately. When there is an authoritative figure in my vicinity, my voice get lower, I get into deep thought and overall I shut down. Interestingly enough, this happens around my boss and doesn't happen when I'm around his boss. It's as if I lose all sense of my personality when he's around which you can say makes sense as he's my boss, however this is to an extent that is almost unhealthy. Plus, he's not a dick, I really have no reason to behave this way. In certain events I experience dissociation from the interaction and sometimes completely space out. This has happened in the past with previous employers, and is not an isolated incident specific to him. If any of you have any advise I would greatly appreciate it. ",10Feb2017,23
3,"It's going to take months of effort to get my mental health reasonably under control, and I could well hit rock bottom again before it's through. But *god* is it a relief to feel that tiny bit better after so long of having no hope, even if better means 'hey, I only *mostly* hate myself today'.",10Feb2017,21
5,"Hi all. This is super complicated but I'm going to try and give you all the short version. 

My cousin was diagnosed with a controversial disease six years ago that is not recognized by modern medicine (chronic Lyme disease). She is 29 but mentally she acts like a pre-teen. My aunt refuses to acknowledge this. 

Since she got sick, she has not been able to eat. When they first started going to doctors, before she was diagnosed, many of the doctors said she may have an eating disorder. My aunt, refusing to believe her daughter may have some sort of mental illness, refused to see any of those doctors again. 

My cousin now weighs 88 pounds and she's about 5'3"". Both my aunt and cousin refuse to see a real doctor or any doctor who isn't ""Lyme literate."" She is going to die. It's just a matter of when. We've tried to intervene and convince them to do something but they are extremely volatile. My aunt almost threw a chair at my mom. They scream and yell. They are both extremely mentally unstable. 

Is there anything I can do? Any sort of police or hospital intervention? I can't just sit and watch my cousin wither away and die while my aunt enables it. I think she should be in prison. It's so much more complicated than this but bottom line is, how do I get my cousin into a hospital?

Thanks all. ",10Feb2017,2
7,"Hi, this will probably be deleted but I am super paranoid and want to know if anything is wrong. Recently when I get high and try to fall asleep I have weird hallucinations.  Sometimes it's like auditorial  where I hear crazy music and sometimes conversations other times it's visual but I can't describe those. This only happens when I close my eyes and try to sleep, but I feel awake but only focusing on that hallucination like day dreaming with your eyes closed. It has never happened with people. I don't get a lot of sleep and I take melatonin before bed also. Should I be alarmed. I read something about schizophrenia when the brain is not stimulated? Is it melatonin? Sleep deprivation? Schizophrenia? I have no other side effects sober",10Feb2017,1
8,"My wife's father has Bipolar Disorder 1. He recently stopped taking his medication. However, he lied about taking his medication, and the last time couple of times that he stopped taking his meds he has had a serious manic/psychotic episode. Her family is extremely worried about him having another manic/psychotic episode (to the point my wife's mom won't stay in the same house if he is not on his meds). He has stated that he want's to be able to function without taking his medications(since his diagnosis it has not been possible for him to function normally without medication). My wife's family has made it extremely clear that if he does stop taking his meds, he will be doing so without the support of the family, or OK from his doctor. Whole situation is a bummer. Need any advice on how the family can talk to the father and convince him to resume taking his medication. ",10Feb2017,2
9,"Today, i had the biggest manic depressive episode that I have in a quite a bit. I just want to write out. Talking to my husband is great but sometimes i just want to talk and talk and talk. I woke up this morning not knowing my trigger but knowing that a panic attack was brewing inside me so I took one of my pills and laid down with ear plugs and a sleeping mask on and tried to fight it off. It was too much for me, goodness I tried though. I cried and cried and rocked myself in the fetal position and tried to slow my breathing while my mind is yelling at myself a million miles a minute. I would not wish that on my worst enemy. To not be in control of your body and mind during a panic attack just drains me. I'm tearing even just writing about it. I felt my mind hating myself and that breaks my heart that I am so mean to myself. I will be 27 in 4 days and I still struggle with the severity of my mental illness. When I was younger, I thought that it would get easier as I got older. I don't have many panic attacks anymore but when I do, I am physically and emotionally drained for the remainder of the day. Today was the first day that I turned into my 15 year old self during my episode-I wished I was normal and that I wasn't crazy. I haven't said that to myself since I was a teenager. I have coped with my mental illness and have embraced it and open about it, but today really messed me up. Today was just bad. Thanks for letting me vent. ",10Feb2017,1
12,"I started seeing a psychiatrist a few months ago as well as starting therapy, and although I feel like I'm in a much better place than I was, I've still been really struggling with focusing even on a movie let alone work and its really been affecting me. I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 two years ago but this new psychiatrist thinks I'm BPD so I've been in DBT therapy and it's really helpful overall. 

Today I saw my psychiatrist and it really made me feel hopeless. I started crying while describing to her my issues with motivation and focus and she immediately asked me if I needed to go to the hospital. I was so confused because I wasn't yelling or freaking out, I was just quietly crying. She kept talking about hospitals and I really felt like she was pressuring me to go. I left feeling really upset and confused, as well as a little insulted about what had just happened.

 She added on another med so now I'm on four different medications, the most I've ever been on. I'm already on Zooloft but now I'm supposed to take Wellbutrin as well and I read that they interact with each other and can cause seizures. The pharmacist said I'll probably be fine so I just took my meds and I'm laying in bed crying because I'm scared of a drug interaction. 

I thought seeing a psychiatrist was supposed to help me feel good, not hopeless and crazy.",10Feb2017,9
13,"I posted this in the Bipolar Subreddit's Friday megapost but now that I've written out all my issues I'd like to post it around Reddit to hopefully get some helpful feedback!

Alongside Bipolar Disorder Type 1 I have this syndrome called Olfactory Reference Syndrome; they don't know if it's a psychotic disorder or more closely linked to the symptomatic profile of OCD. In short; it makes me think I emit a bad smell or a body odour which people are allergic to, every time someone coughs, sneezes, sniffles, clears their throat or shows any sign as being allergic even as much as touching their nose I believe it is because they are allergic to me and I believe every human is allergic to me. Because of this I don't leave the house much (I left once for 20 mins since the 26th of December), I don't have visitors and only communicate via text or email with my friends. It has made my depression worse and feeds into my manic delusional ideas that I come from a parallel universe as I believe that because I am a foreign body (not from this universe) people are allergic to me; this thinking feeds into my suicidal ideation because I believe that in order to get to the other universe (where I come from and where people are not allergic to me) I need to kill myself. 

Anyways, sorry for the long ramble, what was going to be initially a short post turned into a long-ass ramble at least it feels good to get this off my chest, phew! If you have any advice or any tips for me please do let me know as any help would be greatly appreciated!!! ",10Feb2017,2
15,"(Apologies in advance for the length) 
I'm 15, white, male, good looking, smart, wealthy, etc. There shouldn't really be anything wrong with my life, but over the past few years I feel like my mental state has been slipping past the average person's. A lot of it's probably just adolescence, but I don't think all of it is, or if it is it's hitting in ways it really shouldn't be. 

I've felt suicidal now and then, though that's pretty normal for people my age. What I'm really concerned about is the homicidal thoughts that started a couple months ago. I'm not normally an exceptionally violent or angry teenager, but now I frequently find myself thinking of putting a knife in someone's leg or neck, and when I walk into a room I look for a weapon on impulse. The desire is magnified by anger, but not driven by it. I often find myself envisioning the murder of my girlfriend, friends, or strangers with no real motive.

This wouldn't be so worrying if I had some sort of moral code or righteousness to stop me. Unfortunately, I don't. I've adopted a sort of vague and pretentious nihilist/absurdist/existentialist philosophy which doesn't include any moral inhibitions.

I haven't acted on these thoughts and I don't plan on it in the near future, but I do often think that I might like to before I die. I guess you could say murder is on my bucket list. 

I go through waves of drinking. Definitely more than I should at my age. I haven't had any for the past week, but the two weeks before I drank really heavily, sometimes with company and sometimes alone. Mostly just beer, vodka, and absinthe. All I have left now is beer which sorta sucks. Absinthe feels a lot warmer.

I hide the drinking really well from my Mom. She would be mortified if she found out because both her mother and my dad were alcoholics. My dad left when I was four and hasn't stayed in touch very well. I'm really scared of her finding out and feel really guilty about it. If it weren't for her I would probably just try to drink myself to death.

I'm not sure how I feel about my father. It seems as though he was given a choice between my two sisters, my mother, me vs a bottle and he chose the bottle. He was an angry drunk. The earliest memory I have of him is him smashing down a door with a chair. I've had that image in my head for a long time, but it didn't make sense until I got older. He's sobered up now. I had dinner with him in December and he was nice. I feel bad for him, but I don't want him back. I don't think he knows my birthday and he can't pronounce my sister's name

My grades are shit. I don't feel any personal motive to hold them. The only time they go up is when my mother applies pressure and even then it's only temporary. I used to get amazing grades when I was little. I went to a tech private school at reduced cost, won awards, entered competitions. I guess it makes sense that i'm disappointed  now. You can't build a kid up that much and not let him down.

I'm not exactly sure why I'm typing this, but it's really late and I could write forever so I'm gonna stop here. Goodnight(or whatever time of day it is when you read this.)

16,"For as long as I can remember I've been able to shut off emotions at will, I don't ever really do it often, but I'm very aware about how I can either shut off, or even change my current emotion.

Another thing I'm able to do is completely ignore pain, of course it's not always the case, it's something I have to want to do.

I've never brought these things up with anyone, since most people I know are afraid of anything that doesn't seem 'normal' my brother is able to do the same things, even if he hasn't said anything about them, I've seen it. However, nobody else I've met can seem to do either of these things,I was hoping to get someones opinions on this.",10Feb2017,7

But I feel like something is really wrong with me and idk what. I cant seem to get happy, I always feel bored, I feel like my friends are turning on me and kind of hate me, my self esteem is on an all time low, I feel super stressed out about a lot, and I feel very lost on what I wanna do in the future. I am a senior in high school. I hate my life even though I know I am priviledged and that people would kill to be in my position. My parents are pretty nice, but we get into arguments here and there. My friends never invite me to hangout anymore unless im chilling at school. So my days pretty much consist of playing xbox with people who enjoy my company online. Its almost impossible to find a job where I live, as I have been applying every where for the past 4 months. I have a plan to go to college for buisness but I dont really know if I totally want to do it.

19,"For reasons I won't go into, I can't take any standard antidepressant on the market. I noticed recently that my mood is noticeably and immediately improved when I drink coffee, so drastically so that at times I've literally felt suicidal and then had coffee and felt happy. Is it possible that just a straight ""upper"" like Adderall could act as a successful, long-term antidepressant for me? Is this done at all/safe?

20,"So I've been noticing this for about 3 years. I go in and out of my own head constantly. I'll be talking to someone then just forget what they said. I have to have people repeat themselves quite a bit. I spend 13 hours a day in a head shop talking to people. I could be staring directly at them and just not register what they're saying. I hear every word, but it's not coming through. At first I thought I was just ignoring the people who annoyed me, but then I realized just how often it happened. I really thought about it one day, and I ask people to repeat themselves a lot. Unless I'm really interested in what they're saying, I'm just not there. I have a list of phrases and words I use at work and I just recite them. Sometimes what I say doesn't even make sense but I don't realize until after I've said it. People will say good night and I'll say you're welcome for instance. I can still have conversations to an extent, but I check out more often than not. Some days are also worse than others. I'm naturally very introverted so when this starts happening a lot, I feel like I must seem like an asshole, but I'm really not trying to be. When I'm zoned out, Im usually always playing a scenario of some sort through in my head or listening to a song in my head. If anyone has any idea of what this could possibly be so I could look into it more that would be ideal. It's starting to really get to me. I'd rather know I have some sort of disorder than think I'm just not as mentally capable as normal people. ",10Feb2017,5
22,"I've been previously diagnosed with depression and anxiety, whilst I was in the midst of a severe episode.

This is especially true at the moment, as the media is full of articles about NHS time wasting. 

I simultaneously feel that my mental health is both holding me back but also not severe. Part of my is scared that I'm just making this up in my head. I also don't know how to approach my GP.

29,"It's been on my mind forever and I've been thinking of getting some opinions on it (I've seen a couple of mental health professionals for counselling years ago but, the consensus with treating mental health things, if its not a problem causing harm, its something not to be meddled with, in the words of my doctor years ago, ""99% functional is fine"")

Anyway, I don't feel that I feel emotional attachments to people as much as I think I should. I'm mid-twenties, male, and I've always been this way. With my close immediate relatives and so on, I'm no more attached to them than say, a close friend. Not that there's no attachment at all, just very little difference between the two. It's like I have maybe 3 kinds of social circles, people I hardly know, people I do know, and ""close"" people in my life. With relatives, I've lost many over the years to various illnesses, I never really felt sad or affected, I was ""sad"" because that is the ""correct"" response. Now, there are gaps when I'd want to talk to them, and they just aren't there anymore and I feel that gap, sure. I don't feel depressed by it though (and that's what bothers me).

Now at this point, I'm deeply worried that if I lost people closer to me (read: very close immediate family members, I just can't bring myself to type it, sorry), that maybe I might not be sad then either.

I've looked at certain things, psychopathy, Asperger's or something close, but I don't think that is it, or maybe, I'm not sure.

I'm sorry if this seems incoherent or poorly phrased, it's something really personal to me that I don't readily admit. But I appreciate any input at all, guesses or advice, it'll help me work through things. Help?",10Feb2017,1
32,"Hi all,
I have my first appointment with a primary care physician on Monday afternoon to address anxiety and depression I've been struggling with since I was in middle school. I'm rarely sick so I've only ever had a lady doctor and they won't address mental health issues. 
I'm nervous about the appointment and this is the
3rd time I've scheduled it. I have no idea how to address it or ask for treatment. Last time I went to a  walk in clinic was 4 years ago after a month of daily panic attacks and Insomnia. He told me, ""you'll get over it."" Ever since I've refused to get help for fear of being brushed off again. Any tips for someone seeking help for the first time even though they've been suffering for a long time? The anxiety comes in waves. I can go a year..a few months feeling ok and then I'm full force anxiety again. Any advice is helpful. Thanks. 
TLDR: first time doctor visit seeking advice on how to address my anxiety without sounding cliche. 

Edit: Appointment went MUCH better than expected. Doctor was very nice and asked me several questions and I've got a script for lexapro and a script for a therapist. I'm half way there. ",10Feb2017,1
33,"Okay, so I should probably give the rundown, I am a 5'11"" 16 year old male with ADHD, I take Fluoxetine(Prozac) and Guanfacine(Intuniv).

I am a relatively smart person, I'm in AP classes and take  AP-Calculus as a junior, I don't know if this is relevant just covering all my bases. For the past couple months, I've been, different. I've never felt much emotion anyways, and I would be content with not feeling anything, but recently, that numbness is not happy, it's sad, debilitating. The only emotions I feel regularly now are anxiety and guilt. It's becoming increasingly difficult for me to find or recall happiness, with one exception, music. Music, listening or playing, is really all I have any motivation to do, as I've just stopped doing work in my other classes, which I feel regret for, but end up doing the same thing again over and over. I used to play video games because they were fun and exciting, now I waste my after school time playing them not because I truly enjoy them, but because I feel like I have to. 

I'm hungry all the time, am always tired no matter how much I sleep, and have been gaining weight, a year ago I was a skinny 140lb(63.5kg) kid, but now I'm approaching 160lb(72.5kg) and the change in my appearance has put me even deeper into this pit. I never feel present, I can sit through class and not be aware at all, again, with the exception of music. I feel worthless and like no one cares about me, even though I know they do. This whole thing is a bit ironic considering I'm usually the person people go to when they need this kind of help, and I thought I gave good advice, seeing as I've been through stuff before, but nothing like this. I don't know what to do. If anyone can help, please do. I'm sorry this post was so long I don't know if I'll actually get help here I just needed to write this down.

Apologies if this isn't the right subreddit for my question, I will remove it if that's the case.

Due to some issues in my personal life coming to a head, I made the scary decision to see a therapist for the first time in my life.  One of the things on my mind is why since college I have been ""ghosting"" old friends and exes.  If you're not familiar with the expression, it means basically stopping all forms of communication with someone.  This term is often used for dating, but for me it's gone beyond that.
