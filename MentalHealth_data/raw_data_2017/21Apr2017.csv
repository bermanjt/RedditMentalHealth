3,"TW: mentions of sexual abuse


I am now in my mid-20s. Last year I was told by a therapist that I am/was suffering from complex trauma. 


To explain my situation. I was sexually abused at a really young age by a person who was close to my family. This individual stuck around for years, up until my teens when it first dawned on me that what he did to me was wrong. However, I tried really hard to keep it a secret, in an attempt to ""keep up appearances."" I thought this was the right thing to do. 


Of course this wasn't sustainable for my mental well-being. I would spend nights crying about it but then wake up the next day and pretend like nothing was wrong. And I actually believed this. Looking back, I see that my positive affirmations and pushing aside distressing thoughts and feelings as a coping mechanism for a difficult time. But that's where my problem is. 


You see, I'm a very obsessive thinker. Now when I try to let go of negative thoughts and reassure myself that everything will be ok, I can't. I'm too afraid that I'm just leading myself down another scary path of denial. 


My abuser has long been out of my life now since opening up to my friends and family about the abuse. Fortunately for me, I received a lot of support in that regard. However, I think that having suffered silently for so long still affects me today.

How can I tell my mind that it's ok and I don't have to be afraid of letting go?


TLDR; Negative experience with pushing aside distress and attempting to soothe with reaffirming thoughts make it hard in my daily life to let go of negative, obsessive thoughts, need help letting go. ",21Apr2017,2,

I have friends but I constantly feel lonely and like they hate me , we talk at school but they never make an effort to hang out after school. I never feel like myself anymore constantly zoned out and worthless and anytime I am in a good mood I'm just too happy idk , any advice would be appreciated .",21Apr2017,1,
5,"So, let me start from the 'beginning'. It was about 2 years ago when I started having these nightmares. They would happen at random and were not too frequent. Now, usually these nightmares would consist of events where my mother died or something else close to me. When I first started waking up from them I was relieved that it was just a dream. I didn't think much of it at the time and it really didn't effect me. Slowly, I began to wake up from these dreams and just feel slightly sad. Luckily for about a year these dreams went away. 

So, why do I bring this up? Because it happened yet again today. I was feeling very fatigued and I ended up falling asleep. I began to dream about going to some after school thing and it was very odd. My mother picked me up in the dream and began to drive. We crashed into a gas station and I got out and ran. For some reason I ended up back at the place from before. I remember saying ""I'm scared"" and trying to get a hold of my mother constantly. I was screaming and crying, I just wanted my mom to answer the phone. Yet, in this dream I felt I knew she was gone. I felt this hopelessness and emptiness. When I woke up I wasn't affected too bad I just felt tired and a bit sad. But, I had more dreams.

The next dream I had did not involve my mother. It involved morality I guess you could say. It consisted of me and the kids who went to the after school things with me from the other dream. This time we were in a house. I can still visualize it so well... A glass back door, hard wood floors, white walls, a beautiful porch. Yet, something just seemed off. Now, since a lot of it had nothing to do with anything let me skip to the part that matters. For some reason a girl had a lighter and she brought it inside. She was laughing while playing with it. I noticed as she just got to close that there was a propane tank that was leaking gas. I shouted, ""Stop, there's propane!"". Soon, the propane ignited and I tried running down the hallway. I was engulfed by violent flames. I again felt hopelessness as the flames ate away at me and I just stared at the house burning. This time when I woke up I began to feel a bit sick and sad, yet again I fell asleep and had another dream.

The last dream was very odd. This time it was my mom and this fat man. The fat guy I thought was nice at first. He was with my mother in the dream. Over time in the dream I noticed him change though. The man would become very irrational. He would be excited for one moment then all the sudden start getting very angry. This only progressed in the dream. I began feeling scared for me and my mom in the dream. Then he asked me to go to a party with him. I felt uncomfortable I thought in the dream that if I went I wouldn't come back. I hesitated and when I did he started shouting and getting mad. So I went to the door and as I was opening it I was glad that my mother heard it from upstairs. She said ""No, I can't do this he is not going"". Some how from that we ended up outside. I know this may seem weird, but I'll include what happened next in case anyone can think of what this means. Me and the man began digging out weeds from the ground in the yard. My mother was complaining about how bad they were. I began to feel like I was choking while doing it. I really felt like I couldn't breath and it wasn't that kind of just in dream pain. This felt real even in a dream. I was coughing and gasping for air and screaming on the ground for my mom to call 911. She kept hesitating it was like she couldn't hear me. I would keep going on, but she only paid attention to the guy. Now, all the sudden I stopped feeling like I was choking when they both walked into the house. I could hear screaming and then muffling so I ran inside. I grabbed a knife and tried to stab the man choking my mother. I felt hopeless it was as if a magnet was negatively charged against my knife. Every time I swung it just missed and missed. I ran outside and it was sunny. I saw people out there and I shouted for help. When I went back inside to tell him this I saw my mother with a gash in her back. I saw ribbons coming out of her back and she was being used like a puppet. I woke up.

After having all these dreams I began to feel odd. Everything felt off and still is feeling off. I can't describe it well, but I will try. It's almost as if I were dead. I can't help, but question reality. I feel hot very hot. It's almost as if something is radiating off of me. I also have this strange feeling like I am outside of my own body, but at the same time not. Anyways, I know this was long and you probably wont read it, but if you did please let me know what you think everything means.

10,"Hello, I normally don't write here but I just wanted some input on a situation I've recently come across. My dad has a friend who has a son who has multiple disabilities (the man would not specify what disabilities, but Asperger's is a possibility). The son (I'll call him Marvin) reached out to his dad to try to get me to speak with him. As a result, the father gave me his email. I messaged Marvin asking how he was since we haven't spoken since we were kids (we're both now 24). Marvin doesn't respond until 1 year later where he asks who I am. Once I tell him who my dad is he writes me quite naturally and asks for my number. We text fully for the whole day, until he says he needs to sleep. The conversation ends and then the following day he calls me, but I am unable to respond because of work. He continues to call me 2 days in a row many times, and I tell him that I'm busy. I decide to message him the day after asking how he doing and he calls me telling me to leave him alone. He tells me that I don't care about his problems, and that i don't know what he's been through. He also tells me that many people in his life have come and gone and that he gets through it like nothing now. I don't know much about his history, but his dad mentioned that he was bullied in HS quite a bit and that he didn't do well academically, and that he tends to isolate himself. He sounded quite aggressive when I answered his call, and he told me to be more productive and to leave him alone OR ELSE. I was confused the entire conversation because he was the one who initially wanted to communicate. I told my dad about this and now we are wondering if it is a good idea to tell his dad about this or to let it go. His family is a bit old school, and don't seem to want to discuss what special needs he truly has to anyone. I feel terrible about the way I may have come across to him, but I sincerely did want to reach out to him as a friend. What should I do?",21Apr2017,1,
11,"I just need to vent. Or just. Let these thoughts out somewhere. I don't know *what* to do exactly but i just have to throw up this block of text. I might write it in my journal. But my wrist would hurt.  
I needed to make a throwaway for this. I'm too paranoid that I'm being traced if I dwell in places and sites longer than i need to. I even have to write this quickly or they might find out what i'm doing.  So I'll try to be quick.  
The week before my birthday i tried to kill myself, but it didn't work out. I was chased to the hospital by lights and faces in the woods, telling me if i turned back they'd make me regret it. But being there didn't help. They didn't know *what* they were doing. Nothing. They confined me to a room where the walls pulsated and let me rot in soaked clothes from standing in the rain. And it was worse when the ""head"" psychiatrist arrived. He was malevolent, with small eyes that i never saw blink and i could feel one of the hospitals ""guests"" just steadfast in the wall behind him. He didn't want to help me. I was a bother, just trash, something they only then threw out back in the rain when they were tired of hearing the same answer from me- i still want to die. i still want to go through with it- so they could continue their tyranny with the other poor people i could hear in there.  
  
So I was back on the street, the light of morning finally chasing the moving shadows back into their hiding places. I wanted so much more to jump off the bridges i walked over to get home, so much more to take the train to nowhere and simply starve and die on the street. To take the pills i stole that sat under by bed. to take the razor and cut into my wrist as deep as i do my legs.  
But i didn't. Why didn't i? Am I waiting for something? waiting for an ideal moment? waiting until something so distressing pushes me right over? What do i want? I don't want to keep living like *this*. But I'm incurable. Aint no pill gonna cure my ill. It's just part of my brain. Do I want to stay on medication that barely works and struggle everyday for the rest of my life with no excuse? Will i even get a comfortable life that way? Or do i quit cold turkey and just let it do hell on my brain. Commit to the *maybe* tolerable at ""best"" or just commit fully to insightless insanity. To let myself be angry and do what i feel. Or should i just die now? They don't seem to want to help me. They *want* me to kill myself. That's why they just let me off.  
If i kill myself now, i'll come back. Then everyone will stop turning their heads and tip toeing around me. my issues. they wont be able to kill me then. ",21Apr2017,1,
12,"So, I've been on sertraline (Zoloft) since August 2014 (50mg, then 75mg, then 100mg) and about a week ago I finished tapering off of it to go onto buPROPion (Wellbutrin, 150mg twice daily).  About two days after I was off of sertraline, I started getting brain zaps.  Over the last few days it's gotten a bit more intense and frequent.  

What I'm wondering is whether anyone has any recommendations for helping alleviate the zaps?  Additionally, does anyone have any experience using cannabis to help alleviate symptoms?  I've been wondering specifically about CBD products, since they tend to help a whole gamut of ailments.  ",21Apr2017,1,

21,"a month ago i was raped after a night out, i was drunk and wandering the streets after having to leave my house after being threatened by a man who had forced his way into my room (he had followed me home after meeting me in a club). whilst i was waiting for this stranger to leave my house i was grabbed my another man on the street who threatened me with a knife and then raped me down an alley against a fence. the police were called after a member of the public found me on the street, drunk and distressed. 
last week i took an overdose as i feel completely isolated, with no support and no idea what the police are doing despite contacting them and my independent sexual violence adviser.
i went to my GP yesterday to restock on my antidepressants (i have been suffering with depression for a couple of months before the rape). my GP had been informed of the overdose and gave me some useless advice of 'if you feel suicidal have a hot bath, i'm going to look silly if you take another overdose'
not only did i feel patronised i now also feel that I'm now under pressure to pretend I'm fine when I'm not so that my doctor 'doesnt look silly'.
i have limited support from friends and i can't tell my family, I'm completely lost and have found the only way to focus myself is to concentrate all my efforts on losing weight. i hate myself and how my life has been destroyed. all i want is a friend, and a 'hot bath' is not going to change my life.",21Apr2017,2,

23,"Hi all! Thanks for reading. 

So my girlfriend's petition that was published on April 11th and was supposed to be live for 6 months has had it's deadline cut short to May 3rd due to the general election. 

Getting at least 10,000 signatures within 6 months is a big job, let alone less than a month. 

This petition was started after my better half moved to London from Corby. 

In Corby she was receiving excellent support for mental health but since moving to London it's all changed. 

There wasn't any form of handover or referral for support when moving home. 

If you are receiving support for mental health, or any form of health care, this shouldn't be taken away because you move home. Six months later she's still no closer to receiving support of any kind. 

We're still going to keep trying to get to that 10,000 mark so please sign. Every signature is much appreciated.

25,"I came home for some self care after quitting my job last month. Phew what a relief! However, as soon as I got home I started noticing my cousins behavior. At first he seemed manic depressive. But he is also extremely paranoid. He thinks people can hack into his phone, computer, tv and any other electronic device around and watch him. Like when google or amazon suggest things he looked up before he freaks out and thinks people are watching him. His perception of reality is warped. He really thinks people are watching him, out to get him and will not let ANYTHING go. I mean stuff that happened 10-20 years ago he thinks is still relevant (he is 42). He always says he is ""searching for the truth"" whatever that means. He trusts no one except me and maybe one other person. He drinks and smokes weed but I am not sure about any other drugs. He cannot hold a job, friendships or romantic relationships. Has a history of cocaine abuse, domestic violence, and dui. Been to rehab many times but I think it was for drugs and alcohol not mental health. Last night he screamed at my 77 year old uncle (made him cry) because he was certain the neighbors were watching him garden. I have my own shit to deal with so I am not getting involved (this is not my problem) but I would like to provide my uncle with some resources.

Background: I've been taking therapy for a couple of months now but struggle in-between.

It always seems like people going to therapy are there because they have some irrational choices. I don't know the practical differences.

anyway, Everytime I've done therapy, I've sorta come to a good conclusion and felt like my issues were behind me. But when I get to the in-between time I start naturally getting anxious again?

any tips on getting through after therapy, especially for a person with rational issues? I feel like I'm improving but then there's this pitfall.

37,"As a kid, I had weird OCD rituals and ASD rituals as well, poor social skills and intense interests, bad attention deficit and poor motor skills, issues with executive function, literal thinking, hypersenses, at 10 I was dxed as Autistic. Then my family left on sabbatical, I had depression and was put on Prozac, by the time we went home I'd had a meltdown and had to go home from school because I had difficulty with a logic puzzle... Anything that was a threat to my intelligence I couldn't handle. So I remember a lot of fatigue, falling asleep in school, a lot of break time, insomnia, my parents say I was ""thinking really fast"" and that's why what I said didn't make sense. I disagree, I was thinking the normal speed, but I was trying to pull profound insight out of things that didn't need them... I was obsessed with trying to ""figure it out"", so I had grandiosity, but I also didn't think I was a genius... idk, I had a warped vision of what it meant to be normal smart. Anyways, I started having bad tics then, too. I did little ticcy things before but I did really extreme ones in public then. I was hospitalized because I had a meltdown in the psychiatrist's office, then I was taken off Prozac that October and put on risperidone. I got better but was behind in school and had to leave in December, by February I was normal.

My mom says signs of my mania were talking to myself and pacing, however, many Autistics I know also do this.

I'm 18 now, it's been a little over four years since I recovered, and I haven't had any symptoms since then. My mom says I'm more hyper than normal sometimes, I point out that there's a lot of environmental factors there. I also am diagnosed with ADHD. So it's likely that I'm simply hyper when I'm not depressed about something. Because I have no friends and low self-esteem, I often am. I don't engage in risky behaviors or spend a lot or do pressured speech or think I'm all that or think fast or anything like that.

None of my school workers or my social workers see any mania anymore. I've been with them for years and they don't see the pressured speech or inflated self esteem, or any kind of symptom. So they want me to get a second opinion.

One thing that I continue to have is ""What if...?"" issues, like ""what if people could read my mind"", I know it isn't true but it scared me last year even if I knew it was silly.

My mom also is confusing because she said she thinks I might not have it, or it was caused by Prozac, I don't know.

46,"Hello everyone.  I am hoping someone can help...

I am trying to get out of this terrible residential mental health facility in Southern California.  It has reached a point where I just absolutely cannot be here anymore.  I have been here almost 3 months.  When I got here I weighed 126lbs.  I ended up falling below 110lbs after being here for close to 2 weeks.  After that, changes were made and I was doing pretty well for a while.  There were many bumps along the way.  After a while of pretty clear sailing I started to have problems.  I started having panic attacks, falling into depression, and experiencing terrible anxiety.  It turns out that once you start to uncover trauma the problems get terrible for a while before they get  better.  I started to push back through but was then forced to move to the second tier house.  This is when things started to go terribly wrong.  Many changes were made that were extremely unpleasant and ridiculous.  Unfortunately they tried to kick me out for not complying with some of these changes.  I tried to negotiate yesterday, but the asshole owner and directors came again today to bitch everyone the fuck out, with a special focus on me. Right before they could get here, I went to my room and started packing my shit.  One of the directors came in my room and started insulting me and saying I just couldn't handle the program.  I was able to ward him off so I could pack my shit.  He came back a little later and wanted to talk to me again.  He spent even more time making asshole allegations and started calling me (and everyone else here) weak.  Then ""offered"" to move me over to sober living for a month.  From here I am trying to figure out what to do.

Compouding this issue  is the fact that my codependent wife of 17 years is back up in northern california.  She has made a series of ultimatums threatening divorce repeatedly to get me to do what she wants.  While I want to work things out with  my wife, it doesn't seem likely.  She has done nothing but push me away further and further since I started treatment.  She has banned me from coming home until she wants me to.

I feel like I was getting close to a HUGE breakthrough before all this happened in the past few days.  I need to figure out what to do to continue my recovery in a safe place without assholes breathing down my neck.  I have left out most of the really juicy stuff about this place and my relationships with people, so I may seem petty.  I assure you this place is a massive nightmare for a lot of the people here.

I am 32 male without addiction issues.  I do not suffer from any psychosis.  I do not have any sorts of criminal offenses or anything.  Never been to jail.  Never been pulled over on a traffic stop (with me driving).  I have no desires or intentions to hurt anyone or myself.  I have never been in a fight or anything in my life.  I have agoraphobia with panic attacks, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, many specific phobias, PTSD, and codependency.

I'm 1, a very anxious and veeeery shy person, ex: I've been wearing the same haircut for years which I don't like anymore because I don't manage to speak up. I am critising myself 24/7 when alone which causes a lot of self hate and makes me feel even worse. But when others critise me, it's even worse because no matter if it's 'positive critique' that can easily ruin my week because I will think about it until I can't cry anymore because my eyes are too dry. I often try to do something about this but then I end up not being able to stop thinking about the possible negative outcomes which then leads me to not do it anyway. I've been doing this for years. I very often cling so much at one person that I make him leave me unintentionaly which leads into another cycle of selfhate and blame. When I'm around the person im clinging at I'm way less anxious and feeling way better in general but as soon as I'm back to being alone I get back into my unhealthy self critising behavior. I sometimes selfharm to get attention when it doesn't realy make me feel better like small cuts with a kitchen knife and cigarette burns. I don't even like smoking considering the downsides but I do it as a passive way of suicide basicaly because I'm too pussy to just go and shoot through my head. Sometimes I take off all but my shirt at -5°c to gain attention even if that means I'll suffer from the cold. I'm always overtrained because I'm so focused on my looks that I would like to spend every single second with a mirror because to me all that matters is the opinion of other people about me, which I can't really unlearn anymore. Sometimes under stress I lie even if that puts me into a reaaaaly bad situation, like when I was to my second psychiatrist I said I've been physically bullied by classmates of another school for years in the past because I feel like I had to lie to keep attention or otherwise I won't be taken serious.

I have a very close family member who I **love** to death, who was diagnosed with a disorder I'd much rather not say in case she might read this. Let's call her Clara.

Clara is one of the best people I've met, but she keeps having these kinds of crisis (although they're less frequent now) where she says she wants to kill herself but doesn't have the guts, that she would much rather be dead because ""*we would all be better off if she was*"" (I'm not sure if she know how painful this is to hear, even though it's best if she says it, because she has this tendency to just keep everything to herself and it's MUCH worse for her). A few years ago she'd tell me that anybody should have the right to commit suicide if they feel like their lives aren't worth it, which I now relate to how many times she's told me she wants to do it. 

I absolutely **KNOW** that this is extremely hard for her, that whatever goes through her head is extremely horrifying and that she's suffering way more than I have ever suffered, but I can't express enough how she has this attitude where, even though she says ""I'm so sorry, I must exhaust you"", she doesn't really think about how all of what's happening is affecting both my mother and I so hard, so so hard. 

The last time she had a crisis (not long ago) I stayed up until very late with my mother talking about this while she was sleeping. We were both on the verge of tears but didn't cry, although you could **seriously** tell that we both were desperate and didn't know what to do.

Since that day, Clara has been acting... differently. She's gone back to being extremely judgmental and just cannot stand sounds as she could before. She keeps victimizing herself and then making a joke about what we try and tell her. Both my mother and I have SERIOUSLY tried and give her advice that she is just **not taking**. Clara has told me before about how I should not close myself to advice and how people try and show me solutions and how I cannot see them, but she's doing exactly the same.

I've said horrible things to her in the past, I've used her mental health as a way of keeping her silent when things are going too far and when I'm mad, and I acknowledge that it's a disgusting thing to do to somebody who's going through the hell that she's going through, and I **have** apologized and haven't done it in months. I will not come here and excuse myself for doing it because it's just disgusting to do it, but I **will** say that after telling me so many times about how she wants to kill herself, about how we don't understand, about how we keep her down, about how she hurts herself and likes to feel pain and so much more shit that she's told me, I feel brainless and I cannot think. **I must say again, I haven't said anything like that in months because I understand how DISGUSTING I was**.

I feel so drained because I try and understand her so hard, I am making a huge effort to understand her but I can't do it. After her last crisis my brain flicked a switch and now I don't know what to think about **ANYTHING**, I changed priorities so that I'm thinking about her all the time, I stopped feeling things for my boyfriend (I feel like this is because everything is just so fogged up for me) and seeing both Clara and my mother so drained takes me into a constant state of wanting to cry and just not exist.

I hope I didn't make this so much about myself but I'm just not thinking, I need advice so badly and I don't know what to do. Please, somebody help. I want to help her but my whole brain is foggy and has been for about one week.

EDIT: She keeps treating me as if I don't know what I'm doing and controls everything I do. I don't know what to do.

EDIT Pt.2: One of her worst fears if being a burden, and I don't want her to think that she is because **she is not a burden**. We love her no matter what and it's so frustrating when she assumes that we don't want her around, because she has said this numerous times.",21Apr2017,4,
