1,"So, I’m a 17 year old girl and I’ve suffered from anxiety and depression for a couple years now. I’ve always been extremely shy and I’ve never had a real friend since, I don’t know, second grade? I find social situations to be difficult because I’m very self conscious and I’m afraid of getting too close to someone. Anyway, another issue is my parents, the only people I feel somewhat comfortable talking to, don’t understand how I feel. My dad seems to think I’m just overly emotional or that I want attention whenever I’m feeling anxious or depressed. I only live with my mom, and I tell her that I’m interested in therapy. She usually ends up scheduling me appointments but then cancels them shortly afterwards because I “seemed like I was getting better”. Plus, she thinks that medication is more effective, because she takes medication for depression and anxiety. I’ve tried to convince her that I should go to therapy, but the same situation keeps repeating itself. I’m a minor, so I don’t think it’s legal to schedule my own therapy appointments where I live. Plus, I can’t drive. What do I do?

TL;DR: I suffer from depression and anxiety and I have no friends nor any motivation to feel happy, and I can’t convince my parents to get me into therapy.",29Dec2017,1
3,"Hi,

so basically what I was going through this year was just insane. First half Derealization/Depersonalization, second half Depression/OCD but feels like psychotic, because everything seems so surreal. I was diagnosed with OCD and adjustment disorder btw. OCD and not psychosis because I know those feelings and thoughts are somewhat strange.

So basically I recovered from Depersonalization this year...but as the symptoms slowly vanished, I still battled irrational thoughts from day to day when suddenly my mind switched to: ur life is over. I was overwhelmed, suddenly paranoid of time/the date, feeling like I shouldnt be here anymore as the time went on and feeling like trapped in this concept of time.

This feeling...it feels like I shouldnt be alive anymore since August, like I shouldnt have lived past August and should be dead until August. It just feels like it is wrong to be alive, when I go to the hairdresser for example, my mind goes like this: You are dead inside, you died, you dont need to do this, you are trapped in hell, you shouldve killed yourself as I told you! When I look in the mirror: ""Why are u still alive?"" It just cant make sense why I am still alive, and I am super overwhelmed, feeling insane, because I know something IS TERRIBLY WRONG IN MY ORGANISM.

You may ask yourself why ""August""? I dont know, I somehow wanted to be recovered and fine from mental health issues until August, I didnt know what would happen if I didnt recover until then, but my mind has adapted to my expectations and as the time went on without me recovering, my mind realized that and switched to this surreal psychotic limbo mode, so basically I guess false expectations triggered this mess in my mind.

I remembered when these thoughts sneaked in in the last week of July, I felt like after this week I would pass like a strange ""threshold"", like my old self had to die (idk it felt so strange, I just got very depressed, nervous and obsessed with the future and thought if I couldnt cope I may commit suicide, but I wasnt suicidal)

It felt like life after July was just black, I didnt want the future to come and felt like I was involuntarily pushed to experience this future pain, but then there was the 1st of August where I had these painful thoughts that I cant live anymore and got anxious. And this whole ""anticipation"" made me BELIEVE that this is destiny and I cant recover from it!

Furthermore I told my psychiatrist that I feared that I'll lose myself in time, which I know sounds strange but I definitely felt like there would be no future for me and honestly I keep questioning how I survived the last months, making me feel like I shouldnt be alive because the feelings were so surreal. I cant stop thinking that this shit is something supernatural and keep questioning if people had already commited suicide if they would have been in my shoes, what freaks me even more out.

But I have no clue how to get out of that hole at all. I am depressed and scared to death. I dont know, this is just a nightmare and I am 19.

Everytime I think about me as a person, I get a feeling of doom: who is ""I', why am I still alive? Etc. It is terrifying.

4,"So this is my second post here, an update from my last one! I found out caffeine is a manic trigger for me. I drank 4 cups of black coffee at 8pm and by 9pm I was sitting on the floor of my bathroom slicing up my legs so I could escape my body... yeah. Needless to say, I’m going to cut back on the caffeine intake. Back to the reason I’ve returned, I have been on 25mg of Lamotragine for bipolar disorder 2 times a day and I honestly don’t feel like much has changed. I still get manic and depressive and it hasn’t dulled out. I still constantly feel like life isn’t worth living. On the other hand, it does feel like I am numb to others emotions. I genuinely could not care less about things I used to be out of control emotional for. I don’t really know what to tell my psychiatrist or anyone. I don’t really feel like getting better means anything to me anymore. What is wrong with me? hahahaha",29Dec2017,1

9,"A part of me wants to see a psychoanalyst/psychodynamic psychotherapist in a slightly more intensive style, where one discusses past experiences at length and a. describes present patterns of thinking and behavior as accurately as possible and b. uncovers possible unconscious motivations for dysfunctional patterns. There are two main problems I have. One is that I'm still in college, financially dependent on my parents. My parents are perhaps more traditional and stoic in their mindset, and thus asking them for permission and financial support for this type of expensive, time consuming therapy will probably seem self-absorbed and indulgent to them, and perhaps they would even have a point. But the stuff holding me back is very distressing, and long standing, and it seems to me that if anyone would benefit from this type of objective analysis from a trained professional, it would be me. So should I try convince parents and withstand the heat from them, or pursue other forms of treatment? I would feel self-conscious and ashamed whenever near them, and it would be the elephant in the room. But going on as I am now seems like letting the unconscious mind just spit out the same stuff over and over again. I have a strong desire to know myself and have good reasons for what I do in life, but this is in some sense ""mental masturbation,"" right? Who in general is an ideal candidate for receiving this type of treatment?",29Dec2017,1
10,I’ve been having mental breakdowns all day.  I’ve basically been barred from going to my dads house ever again.  All because I wanted to bring my dog inside when it was 35 degrees outside and raining.  I kept him in his kennel all night after he was inside.  I was woken up at 7am with him yelling at me to “get that fucking dog out my house”. This isn’t even the first time something like this has happened.  He always does shit like this.  It’s like he looks for reasons to be angry.  I know I shouldn’t have brought my dog inside but I couldn’t stand to have him shivering outside all night.  That might be the last time I see some of my family.,29Dec2017,1
11,"Some background: I have Major Depressive Disorder and ADHD; my long-term partner of almost 10 years was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder about three or four years ago. He'd been in therapy before due to being a bully victim and some instability in his home life, but no therapist had caught on to any possible signs of the disorder. As a result, whatever problems we had early on in our relationship we probably handled in a way that, in hindsight, was not appropriate for anyone with the disorder. Oftentimes, this comes back to haunt us.

Shortly before he was diagnosed my partner graduated from a Master's program but was unable to land a job, or even an internship. He then began losing a lot of weight and it was discovered that he had a undiagnosed Low-FODMAP and ulcerative colitis. My mother, a psychiatric nurse, picked up on some of his behaviors and suggested he get evaluated for anxiety and it turned out he'd had GAD this whole time. His being unemployed and recovering from gastrointestinal problems (that were triggered by his increasing anxiety) have exacerbated said anxiety. Being unemployed means his insurance isn't the best. He's been seeing a psychiatrist and received a prescription for anti-anxiety meds which helped a lot, but his doctor said he wasn't depressed (even though he has all the signs of depression) so my partner gave up on therapy (which was intermittent anyway). 

In the last year my partner has been having issues with controlling his temper and his reaction to certain triggers. I finally got him to agree to therapy for anger management and possible depression and PTSD. We've managed to talk through a lot of problems (we have no choice really, I can't afford couple's therapy for *both* of us) and he's more motivated than ever to change, but sometimes I feel like it's almost too little too late? It doesn't help that we both have other stuff going on (I moved back home to take care of my dad who has a terminal illness, and my SO has a disabled parent) externally, our disorders seem to clash and I haven't been able to find articles on how to deal with this. I feel like I can't go to him to seek reassurance about our relationship's future or that he is looking for work without triggering him or sending him into a panic attack that ironically leaves him unable to look for work. He picks apart and overanalyzes any form of expression (or lack thereof) on my part, which is frustrating for someone with ADHD. I also can't help but feel efforts on my part aren't being reciprocated. 

I don't want to throw away ten years of an otherwise supportive, fulfilling relationship, and it would be shitty of me to cool things off after he's finally agreed to prioritize his mental health, but things can't continue on like this. I want to build a life with this man, but how can I remain a supportive partner while maintaining my own mental health. 

TL;DR: My partner has GAD, anger management issues, and possibly PTSD and depression. I have ADHD and MDD. We've had problems before his diagnosis, he's finally getting sufficient treatment, but after everything we've gone through together I'm burnt out. How do I stay strong for the both of us

12,"I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder about 6 months ago after years of dealing with the symptoms. My psychiatrist, however, was unable to pinpoint which disorder, as my symptoms didn't seem to fit the classic descriptions of GAD or SAD. My anxiety is almost always triggered by social situations, but I'm fine with being around large groups of people, like at a party or concert. My problem generally comes when hanging out in small groups of people, even with good friends and family. I often avoid hanging out with people or spend much of my time at gatherings thinking of excuses to leave. In situations where I have no path to leave, I really start to ""freak out"" internally. I am being treated with antidepressants currently, which is nice, but I wish I had a name to go with the problem so that I could feel more comfortable talking about it with the confidence that I would be taken seriously and understood. As a 19 year old man it is unfortunate that being anxious is sometimes viewed as weakness, and I would really appreciate something that would make it easier to explain to friends why I may feel/act a certain way and why I sometimes just need to get time alone. Anyway, this post seems to have become more of an outlet for venting than a question, lmao, but I appreciate any discussion.",29Dec2017,1

16,"I'm on winter break from school (I'm a senior in high school, 18) and the new time I have on my hands is killing me. I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts and a bad temper for a while now (going on two years if I'm not mistaken,) lots of big things have happened in that time frame. Started dating a girl I had a huge crush on which felt like a dream over the summer who left me for her ex in October. Got way too serious with her for my first girlfriend, admittedly. Left a toll on me and I've been unsure how I should feel, I've been on a rollercoaster of emotions that always seems to come back to anger. If you can believe it despite this choppy wall of text I'm hoping to become a writer.

Anyway, I met another girl who's recently gone through a breakup of her own and we've been dating since the beginning of November. It's awkward because she's actually good friends with my ex and I feel guilty that she's in the middle of both of us, and she feels like she has to keep our relationship a secret to spare my ex's feelings. It's difficult describing what we have but she makes me far happier than my ex ever did; for instance I was always worried that I wasn't good enough for her and that I would lose her (interesting how that turned out,) whereas my new girlfriend is unbelievably supportive. She's a truly selfless person and I'm sorry to say she's been dealing with suicidal thoughts as well. We both grew up with absentee fathers and abusive replacement figures, although between the two of us she had it far worse. For a brief time I was cutting myself and I stopped after she showed me her own scars.

A while ago I had planned to kill myself on the 20th of this month (the last day before our break) but as we got to know each other I knew I couldn't go through with it. She'd lost three people close to her that way, the most recent having been this spring. If I did, she would have.

I feel I should mention now that I'm thinking of it that I think one of my biggest issues is comparing myself to other people. My suicidal thoughts started out as anxiety about whether I could function on my own (until recently I was pretty sheltered) which would have been the summer before last, which compounded with a self-deprecating attitude I had developed as a result of poor grades in my freshman year. Quite frankly I don't think I'm worth anyone's time. One of my biggest issues (relationship wise) with my first girlfriend was my habit of apologizing and asking if we were OK. I'm surprised we lasted as long as we did. I can't drive and I don't have a job.

So back to my current girlfriend...I don't feel anxious around her, and I don't feel the urge to blow up her phone because I'm nervous about what she's doing. She's essentially in the same boat as my ex, as they're both waitresses (though my current GF works a second job as well) and both have their licenses. I mean, logically speaking I should be even more guilt ridden around her, but that's just something I find odd I guess. I'm not complaining.

My mental state was pretty awful following the breakup of course. I'm an introvert by nature and after that I became even more withdrawn. Typical teenage crap I guess, I have to feign some self awareness to post this on the internet. Musical tastes shifted to metal and the familiar left-leaning punk agenda because it helped calm me down when I was pissed and all my other playlists reminded me of my ex. (I'm a huge 70s-80s nerd, not in the ""OMG you should watch Stranger Things"" way but I predominantly listened to the Police, Blue Öyster Cult and New Order. No offense if you enjoy Stranger Things of course, I didn't come to a mental health sub to shit on people.) So you know, Dead Kennedys, Hüsker Dü, the Clash, Ramones, Agent Orange, Dicks, even Austrian Death Machine is pretty great for blowing off steam.

I've got this beanie I've worn since I moved here in 10th grade I feel like I should mention as well. It's just gray and black, no pom or anything, and it's basically a security device for me. Like Linus' blanket. Sometimes I wake up at night and panic for a moment because it's not on my head. My point is that it makes me look kind of shady (""like a pot dealer"" as my friends have said.) Long story short, add the beanie to my reserved nature and my shitty disposition as of late, and I've had some assumptions made about me. Someone asked me for an edible. My ex accused me of giving her a ""death stare."" Jesus, this is a long post. I know I'm rambling but it feels good getting it out.

I'm posting this because lately I haven't been able to motivate myself to do or try much of anything. These late hours of the night are the worst for me. I've either been eating because I'm bored, or angry for some reason, or...well, horny. Whenever I try to sit down and write I either can't think of anything good or I can only get a few very painful, deliberate lines down before I get frustrated and give up. My only respite is getting to see my girlfriend or, ironically, showering because my brain seems to turn off in there. I've eaten four Klondike bars today. I don't expect anyone to read these ravings in their entirety, but if you've got any advice...even a fun game or something to keep me occupied, I would really appreciate it.",29Dec2017,1

23,"Hi there. I'm new to this subreddit. I am looking for a sense of community. I have lived years feeling isolated even when I haven't been alone.

When I was little, though, I was alone a LOT. My mom was not attentive very often unless she was getting after me for something I did that would bother her or to give me commands (this wasn't ALWAYS the case, but it dominated over times she was kind or attentive.) Dad was mostly kind to me as far as I can remember but he was often absent since he had a pretty hardcore drug addiction and was in and out of rehab. The neglect and isolation got worse as I got older. Dad died, and within year and a half of his death Mom started leaving leaving my siblings and me (age 9 and onward) home alone, often for days at a time. I am the oldest of several children and the responsibility that Mom would avoid would fall on my shoulders. I almost always felt alone and ""in my head,"" daydreaming, fantasizing about what I would and could do if I weren't home alone tending my siblings. I would miss school a lot, for years. We started moving around frequently and I felt more social anxiety and isolation with each move. Around age 9 I developed a perfectionistic personality, an eating disorder, OCD, and I've felt recurring, pervasive depression and sense of loneliness since I can remember being alive (probably since I've been 3 or so.) I'm a creative person and I also used making art and music to cope, but the older I've gotten the more ""scatterbrained"" I feel my mind has become and I've also become so busied with other responsibilities, art is often put on the back-burner and when I DO participate I will either feel extremely exhausted and uninspired as I try to work and give up easily on a project, or I will be bursting with ideas that I can't keep up with and I will lose steam and focus often before finishing something and the project goes abandoned. This happens over and over and over again. It has for years.

Growing up, there was also physical and emotional abuse and sexual trauma for which I've been seeing therapists for years. I've worked through a lot of my wounds in DBT, CBT, EMDR, tons of journaling and talking it out. I wonder how much of the neglect/abuse affected the formation of my brain and mental health. I'm not really here to focus as much on that as to say, no matter what I seem to do, no matter how many therapists I see, support groups I've joined, medications I've tried, ""healthy"" living I try to embrace (trying to eat in a balanced, nutritional way, attempting to get on a healthy sleep schedule (I really struggle with that,) exercising regularly, taking vitamins, meditating, yoga, getting babysitters so I can go on dates with spouse and participate in uplifting social activities, and other forms of self-care...I still can't seem to get CONSISTENT peace of mind. My mind swings from feeling very depressed, exhausted, and lonely to this heightened state of anxiety and sense of sudden capability. I often feel easily irritable. I don't do super ""extreme"" things, so I don't think it's bipolar I, but I've been suspecting and wondering lately if it's bipolar II. The bursts of energy I sometimes feel, which are so fleeting, seem to be just like normal functioning in a more condensed state. What I mean is that, for example, I might get a sudden burst of energy and spend a whole day cleaning and organizing my house and suddenly get the energy and confidence to go to the store and purchase a bunch of organizational items and drop off the Salvation Army donations I've been meaning to get to, which have been heaping up into a huge pile over the previous several months. I suddenly have energy to do ""normal"" projects that I don't typically have the drive or focus to do, so I want to do as many as I can while I have the energy. It's often annoying to my spouse because I will stay up late and focus on such projects but avoid intimate/relaxation time with him because my mind is in some sort of ""tunnel vision"" mode. It's like I don't know when the next time I'll feel good enough to get these to-dos accomplished so I ""binge"" on them before I run out of steam, and I'll make elaborate plans to do more to-dos, but then within a day or two I'll ""crash"" back into a disorganized depressive state in which I feel like I can barely function, I'm exhausted, and the messes start piling up again.

DOES ANYONE ELSE RELATE TO THIS? I went to see a psychiatric NP a couple of weeks ago and asked to be screened for bipolar II. She did a quick screening but wasn't convinced/didn't feel she had adequate information to conclude that I have it, but also didn't want to rule it out. I'm not on any meds right now as I am currently pregnant (third trimester) and NP doesn't want to interfere posing possible risks on baby. Note: I do have these emotional and physical ups and downs historically even when I'm not pregnant.

I also have never felt a big enough of a positive difference while on SSRIs in the past, so I haven't continued to take them for more than a few months or maybe a year at a time. I'm really curious if mood stabilizers would help me. I have never tried mood stabilizers. I've been so reluctant to take meds in past even though I've tried a few (Wellbutrin, Paxil, Zoloft and I think Prozac) at different times over the past 10 years, but I am so desperate for help. Note: I was also diagnosed with ADHD (the quieter, wandering mind type) while in college 10 years ago and took Adderall at different times. I DID notice a difference in focus then, but my anxiety was often through the roof and I just went into tunnel vision/panic/over-work mode most of the time. It helped me get through semesters in college but it didn't add much to my quality of life otherwise.)

I am desperate for community. I am embarrassed to share all these details with my spouse as I don't want to burden him with this stuff constantly. He does know I went to see NP and he knows about my mental health issues and my past, but I haven't told him I suspect I might have bipolar II. I fear he will get fearful and distracted by the possibility of something that still sounds kind of taboo. Honestly, he would probably be really supportive, though. I just don't want him to be the only person in my support system, I guess, as I think I need other voices, especially those of whom who have experienced similar things as I have and who have found the treatment they need to live with well-being and vitality instead of in a vicious, mentally-exhaustive cycle all the time...that is, if anyone who is reading this can relate to that. 

I really want to get the help I need but I feel like I still living in so much confusion and struggle to advocate for what's really going on in my head in a realistic way that my doctors/providers can understand. I try but when I discuss the symptoms I feel like I want to scream them out but I am so calm, so composed every time I go, and I often seem to forget how bad symptoms are until I'm in the throes of them. Hope that makes sense.

I need help so I can be as healthy a person as possible: for me, for my spouse, for my existing children and this baby that will soon be here. I have gone through deep, pervasive post-partum depressions and anxiety attacks with my previous children and I am trying to arm myself as much as possible with resources and skills before I have this one.

I’m trying to find help here, before I go to a doctor. Some context: I had depression &amp; anxiety for a year or so now and I’m on 20mg fluoxetine, It’s not serious. Out of the blue, as I almost fell asleep, this extremely horrifying thought hit me like a f*cking freight train, I couldn't think about anything else, no matter how much I tried, I had no control over my mind, I was terrified to the point I felt I was going to vomit, it was so extreme I would have jumped out the window to stop it (this is not an exaggeration). The ‘attack’ lasted a couple of minutes, I had a cigarette and put some music on to get back to normal. 
If you want to know what the thought was I’m sorry to disappoint you, I managed to intentionally forget what it was, I’m trying to get it back though, I think it might have been something to do with a past experience but I’m not sure.

34,"I feel like I have some alternate form of OCD. Take for example like when I’m closing a door, if I have some kind of unwanted bad thought like “my house burning down” while I’m closing the door I have to close the door again while trying not to think of anything bad like that because I’m afraid that if I close the door while accidentally thinking of something bad and awful then it’ll happen in real life. I have ADD so my mind is rarely ever clear so all these thoughts and words and bouncing around in my head so it’s sometimes hard to control when I accidentally think of something bad and it sometimes leads to me closing a door like a ridiculous amount of times and I’m sick of it. 

Already when I’ve been typing this, I’ve had to type and retype words several times because I’ve had bad thoughts when typing a word and I feel like I have to delete the word and type it again. 

This part’s kind of hard for me to admit because of how weird it makes me sound but sometimes when I’m just sitting there and I have a bad thought then I furrow my eyebrows really quick because I feel like if I don’t then the bad thought will really happen. It’s like I’m frowning at the bad thought because of how bad it is because I want it to go away and I want it to be known that I don’t really think that or want it to happen. I don’t know who I want it to be known by. Nobody knows what I’m thinking about, reading minds is impossible after all. It’s all really stupid and I know nothing bad will happen if I close a door while accidentally thinking of my house burning down but I can’t help but close the door again anyway. 

I really don’t know what’s wrong with me and I’m sick of doing the same thing over and over again several times in a row to achieve some kind of peace of mind. (For the record I’ve typed and retyped “peace of mind” like 10 times).

I'm a product if what my dad and brother made me, my brother held me captive for a year and tortured me, ive developed mh issues, and the patterns I implement to make my life livable are dangerous for others and I'm scared itl hurt them. 

I can't explain this to people though. But I'm not straight, men are my self harm.",29Dec2017,1

43,"Hello. I have been diagnosed with depression, but I'm starting to believe that maybe I have some other problems. I could use some input from someone else. Sorry if some things in here are irrelevant, I could't really figure out what was and wasn't relevant. I'm 18 and female. Thank you for your help :)


*	I don’t really have an identity, in the sense that I don’t know who I am. I have trouble describing myself, talking about my strengths, weaknesses and personality traits in general. Normally I use other people’s descriptions of me to try and figure out who I am, but that doesn’t always work because they sometimes contradict each other, which makes me feel really lost and confused because I start doubting everything everyone ever said about me. Because of this I’m always trying to find ‘’boxes’’ to put myself in, stereotypes that I can identify with, but I never actually stick with them, and normally go from one to the other every other week.


*  This also kind of applies to the way I view myself when it comes to looks. If someone says that I’m really attractive, I feel good about myself. However, if the next day I meet someone new and they don’t make any comments about my looks, I start believing that maybe I’m not that attractive after all, and feel really depressed. I am very preoccupied with my looks, but I need the approval of others to actually feel good about myself.


*	My self-esteem in general depends a lot on other’s opinions of me. I only feel good about myself when people compliment me and/or pay me attention, or when I receive a good grade on a test or do well in something else. I feel very embarrassed when these things don’t happen, and I can get very depressed if someone is better than me at something that I consider myself good at. Since I have no idea what kind of person I am, I tend to consider things that I’m good at as part of my personality (like having good grades), and if someone is better than me at those things I actually feel like my identity was stolen and that I have been replaced.
 

*	I have trust issues. I was bullied when I was very young and the friends that I had over the years weren’t always very nice to me. I remember having a ‘’best friend’’ who would ditch me for another person most of the time and actually make fun of me behind my back. We were friends for a very long period of time and I depended on her a lot because of my shyness and trouble making new friends. Even when the person that she used to ditch me for stopped going to our school, I always felt really depressed and worried when she started talking to other people, because in my mind she would eventually get sick of me and replace me again. Even though I’m not really friends with her anymore and have met new people, I always get very jealous and sad when they talk to other friends or ignore me for some reason, and I start thinking that maybe they don’t like me that much at all and that they wouldn’t really notice if I disappeared.


*	I am really, really anxious and I panic very easily. I’m terrified of failure and of other people being better than me. I tend to not do well under pressure and I get very anxious when I have an oral presentation. because I’m worried that I’ll make a fool out of myself. And when something does go wrong, my self-esteem completely plummets and I actually start thinking about suicide and things like that.


*	Even when I’m walking down the street I’m very awkward and self-conscious. Like, I’m hyper aware of my body and I forget what I am supposed to do with my arms and mouth. I feel like everyone is looking at me, which makes me really nervous. This only happens when I’m walking by myself, though.


*	I have a weird relationship with Men. I don’t remembering ever being abused, but since I was a child I always felt slightly afraid of men. I had one of those creepy uncles who would complement me inappropriately sometimes or hug me for just a little too long. I grew up with only male cousins and brothers and we would sometimes play those stupid games related to sex that kids play, and look up porn in the computer. I remember them touching me once or twice in places that I didn’t want them to. Because of that, I became aware of sex since a very early age. I also developed relatively early, which made boys pay attention to me, not always in a positive way. I grew up hearing sexual comments about my body from kids my age, and this actually started in elementary school. These comments never made me feel good about myself, I felt like a disgusting freak, and things actually got worse when some girls who were jealous of the attention guys were giving me started bullying me. Eventually even older men started harassing me in some way or another: I was catcalled, slapped in the ass, etc. All these things made me a cold person who has trouble opening up, and I have trouble feeling safe around men/boys I don’t know. Even my relationship with my father suffered. Even though he never harmed me, I didn’t want him to touch me in any way and was always suspicious of his motives when he did touch me. Even nowadays I have trouble kissing him on the cheek, even if I know he won’t harm me.


*	I was always very quiet as a child and had trouble making friends. I daydreamed a lot. I had an ok childhood and my parents loved me a lot.  However, they were always fighting with one of my older brothers. I could hear it from my room and they did it basically every day. That brother wasn't always nice to me. He called me stupid and dumb a lot, and he would actually hurt me physically sometimes. He called me a liar when I told him he was hurting me and would tell my mom that he barely even touched me.  This made our relationship obviously strained, and I still have trouble opening up to him after all these years.


*	I was actually diagnosed with depression when I was 13. During that time, I self-harmed a lot and had to be institutionalized. I only told a few close friends what happened, and I didn’t really want to talk about it with them. I didn’t really feel better after coming back from the hospital, but I had to say that I did because I absolutely hated it in there and I actually felt worse in there. The emptiness never really went away, I guess. Even when I felt happy, I felt like it could all change in a moment. My family didn’t really understand what I was going through, they thought that being this miserable was a choice or a matter of ‘’not having a positive attitude’’.  Almost no one was aware of what happened to me. Then, when I was sixteen I completely relapsed. I felt empty all the time, I started cutting again, I missed school regularly. But no one ever really noticed, I think. After a stupid fight with my dad, I completely broke down. I took around fifty pills, I think, and hid my goodbye note under my laptop. When my parents found my lying in bed almost passed out they drove to the hospital and I stayed in a mental institution for a few weeks. Two years have passed since this happened and while I don’t feel miserable all the time anymore, I think there is something wrong with me besides my depression, but I don’t know what it is. I just feel like the way I feel and think is different from everyone else, and things that for some reason don’t really affect other people leave me feeling completely panicked and suicidal. I just tend to overreact to the dumbest things and it makes me feel really bad about myself :(

44,"I am so confused guys.
So, basically my story with HOPEFULLY Harm-OCD began 5 months ago, It was triggered by reading the news about Chester's bennington suicide. I am 20 years old male, with a previous history of OCD(Fear of getting a heroin addict.), but I can't tell if it is the same or worse. It is horrific.
Here is what happens.
After I read the news, in my head went something like 'If he can do it, then why shouldn't I?' And I started having intrusive suicidal thoughts, I will give an example:

-A friend: Lets go and drink a coffe tomorrow.

-Me: Okay

-My mind: If I don't suicide by then.

So basically at the begining (the first few hours) It was terrifying, but I was unaware what is going to happen after this.

So I got pretty paniced and googled: 'intrusive suicidal thoughts' and major depessive disorder or OCD showed up. I entered both web pages and both said '10 times higher chance of commiting suicide.'

This was the moment when everything fell appart.

This was the moment when I felt this rapid change in my mind.

This was the moment in which I felt like a part of me changed into something horrific.(Okay this was too much movie like sentence, but anyway.)

So basically my life is pretty rough since then I will try to be as accurate as possible, I have days in which I feel relatively normal. So, here are the things happening in my head and body. Some of them are constant, some of them are not.

Intrusive suicidal thoughts which feel real. I really hope they are intrusive, and not true Suicide Ideation. With a confusion If I want them or not. Which is terrifying.

Knot in the stomach.

Whenever I look online for something to buy, there is a feeling like 'There is no point I won't be here soon' and a knot in the stomach.

Feeling like I can't do anything fun, like can't relax I don't know how to describe it.

Less interest in people.

Less apetite.

Sudden feeling of tiredness sometimes.

Nearly constant, uneasiness.

Scary feeling, when I imagine my life without these thoughts, it feels like kind of boring?! I don't know it this is the right word.

Feeling on the edge, feeling like my life is shortened, like I will do something bad soon.

Random feeling of life being pointless without a reason with a variating duration.

Random TERRIFYING Intese feeling like trapped in life.

Random feeling that I need to escape, but there is no place to.

When I am feeling bad, there are constant thoughts, random things I have read on google reddit, with a pictures of the article I was reading.

I stopped working, and now I feel like If I work or feel overwhelmed I will do it.

I stopped University becausw of it, and because I didn't find it interesting.(I made a mistake with chosing my subject.

Intrusive unsettling feeling real scenarious in which my best friend tell me If I want to work with him.(We had a pretty sucessful store.

Feeling like I don't want to admit that I am suicidal?!

Feeling like I don't want to get better?!? I tried finding a reason, but I can't think a reason why, like I stop thinking when I try.

Fear that I developed these thoughts, a few days before Chester's thing, and I try to see my chats to see if there are some signs, but it is impossible to be sure.(This is not a big deal, but I am trying to be as accurate as possible.)

At first I thought this is depression, however I don't show many signs of depression. Then I thought it is Anxiety, but It feels darker and realer than Anxiety.

Weird negative feeling when babies arround.

Random feeling like everything I see is too much?

Fear/Feeling like this is something unknown, incurable and it is impossible to feel like before.

Intense moments when I feel like I am losing control. (I will give you an example of what it looks and feels like.) It happened 2-3 times for the last 5 months.

And the most important and horrific: 
Scary intense moment with like a physical urge ######6. As it follows:
It is triggered randomly.
This is what happens: life feels meaningless with a weird image stuck in the back of my head feeling, like future idk, feeling of unrasiness, unsettled feeling, negative scenarious, I try to calm myself with a positive thoughts, I succeed for like a second, then it feels like the negative thoughts, reinforce themselfs and become more and more intense, then I am like 'If i feel like i will do something i will go to the hospital, chill., then like 'it doesn't matter you feel trapped' and it becomes even more intense and more intense uneasiness feeling, i close my eyes laying in my bed, almost starting to feel normal for a couple of seconds, then i open my eyes and everything in my head is intense again, i try again to counter them, it becomes even more intense.

I have several questions:

Can OCD feel like a desire?!?!

How long does OCD urges last?

Was this actual s urge or ocd?!

What does it look like?

Does it look like actual suicide ideation/suicidality?

Thanks in advance.

46,"I have become a lot thinner this year because I moved out and am living on my own, and doing a horrible job at taking proper care of myself. I put off things like groceries just because I am too terrified and depressed to go out in public. My face has become a bit gaunt and pale as a result and I'm afraid people who see me and don't already know me will think I'm a drug addict. 

So basically, I don't really have a bit appetite. I eat small meals, but I never miss breakfast because I usually am hungry in the morning. But even if I'm not hungry I still eat something because my meds don't work unless I take it with food. I used to be average sized about 125 pounds, don't know what I am now but I'm sure it's not that. I don't think I have anorexia because I'm not really concerned about that...I just feel depressed and don't have a big appetite. I also don't like feeling full because it makes me feel bloated and sleepy, and it becomes difficult to focus on tasks I'm doing like when I want to write or do illustrations.  

On the flip side, I binge eat chocolatey sweets if I have any. Christmas is bad for this because my family gives me so much delicious candy and sweets, and they don't know how anxious this makes me. For some reason if I have a whole box or tin of chocolates, I get this overwhelming feeling like I HAVE to get rid of them. It's like a weird compulsion like they can't be here, I have to eat all of them so that I won't have to think about them anymore. It's crazy. I do this to myself every year, I receive all this delicious candy, and then I secretly binge eat all of them until my stomach hurts, and will sometimes eat them and skip lunch. Does anyone here get that feeling like they need to get rid of the food they have by eating all of it at once? What is that? I don't get it.

48,"I'm 18 and have been officially diagnosed with ocd and depression (I take pills for) and autism. I casually, thinking it was normal, mentioned I throw up to mates. I usually eat quite little, but whenever I eat a lot, or greasy food, or dairy, or drink alcohol I'll deliberately make myself throw up. I don't do it to lose weight, just to feel physically better.

Im not always like this.
But its getting worse...
Idk whats going on

Im so angry.
Why do i get like this?what is wrong with me?
I hate myself and i wasnt brought up properly but all my fam does is play the blame game. Ive no real support. Everythings a mess.

I hate myself for being like this. It terrifies my mam and i legit act like a lunatic. Aftereards i hate myself. I dont enjoy this. I dont get a power trip off raising my bvoice and scaring people altho i think my mam believes im like my dad. He was violent and beated her and was an evil torturing bastard. Sadly he was never put behind bars or payed for what he did.. my poor mam instead has to live now with his child.. 
I dont want to be like him.. i just lose my temper but im not like him.. he has no heart and would never in a million years harm himself or say hes the blame. 
He thinks hes a god basically. He said it a few times. Everyone should obey me. I am better than ye. I swear down he said this. Like a madman too mind you..

It hurts that my mam is comparing me to him. I dont blame her. I wish i could end my life. I think it would be best.",29Dec2017,1
50,"I like to write down in a journal events like this here is the entry:
can’t stop having a conversation out loud, arguing with myself. 2 selves? One keeps saying no and not giving the other a chance. I don’t know what I’m not giving myself or ""it"" the power/space to do. Who do I listen to? The dominant one? Or the one who won’t quit asking? Dominant one got upset and I felt it. The other is disappointed, but persistent. I don’t feel emotion from it.

In case this is a little incoherent here is the rundown. I realized i was arguing out loud with myself. One of the personalities was upset and i could physically feel it. But i could not feel the others emotion. I have seen a doctor, but I only went once because I am afraid of what he might say. I think i will go back some day.

51,"I'm going to skim over a lot of things just to make this more readable, and so that it doesn't go on for absolutely forever.

Essentially, since I was really young I've always been kind of an anxious person and I've always had this really strong desire to make sure everything is done the right way. It's not like, a perfectionism type of thing because it's not like I'm cleaning stuff or ordering everything around my house a certain way. It's more that I seem to have these sudden thoughts that kind of frighten me a little, where I think that something is going to go wrong unless I do things a certain way.

I know I'm making this really vague and it sounds rambly, but for context here's an example. I'm particularly anxious this way with relations and friends, and sometimes I'll have a thought out of nowhere like ""touch the corner of the doorframe three times, then stop, then touch it once more or else it means [boyfriend] will stop loving you."" I know that sounds crazy, but it's constantly now and I can't help doing these things. It drives me nuts, I have so many of these routines throughout the day, and if I don't or can't do them, it makes me squirm. I can't sit still, I can't get my mind off of them and I want to cry because I feel like I'll be responsible for something bad happening. In my mind, I know that it's stupid because obviously me tapping the edges of my phone in a certain pattern won't stop my mother from contracting an illness or falling or something, but I'd rather just do it to make me comfortable and feel like it's not my fault if something does happen.

I don't have a clue what this is, and I know that everyone has their own little routines and quirks, so I'm not sure how uncommon my behaviour is. I'm embarrassed to talk to anyone about it, and honestly I don't really feel like there's anybody I'd want to speak to about it anyway. I've been doing this for about 10 years now, so it's been pretty consistent, but it's annoying me more and more every day as it becomes more of a hindrance and more anxiety-inducing when I can't do my routines.

Can anyone give me some advice? Or even just some direction on what I could/should do here. Thank you so much for reading.

Edit: I'm happy to clarify if anyone needs to know more to help me out, and give some more examples if it would help.",29Dec2017,3
52,"Before we go and WebMD me, or any of you, with Pseudo-Balbar Affect, I've looked into it and I really don't think that I fit the bill. But that's just my opinion. I've narrowed down some possible root causes but that's another thing. I will sometimes feel the need to cry without much provocation, or I just get the feeling that it's welling up and I'll know that sooner or later, I will cry. Arguments with people I really love will make me feel weak and want to cry, even if it doesn't really earn a cry. What I want to ask is how some of you handle it. Sometimes, if I know I'm feeling vaguely teary I will listen to a piece of music and I have a little cry, but it's crying for something I find truly beautiful. Sometimes that's not an option though.

58,"I'm 24 and have always been a relatively stable person regarding my mental health. Of course I've had my downs (like every human does), but I was usually able to pinpoint exactly what was making me feel upset and my bad feelings would resolve themselves within a few days (or hours). Overall, I would definitely say I've had a very happy life.  

Ever since I graduated from grad school (4 months ago) and have been on the job search/started my new job last month, I've felt unhappy. I've been in school my whole life and really thrived in that structured, social environment. I've just always had a long-term goal in mind (i.e., graduation), and it's really difficult to not have one now. 

I've also had a big falling out with one of my best friends recently, which was a long time coming, but it's still upsetting to me. Thankfully I still have a handful of best friends (and a very supportive, close-knit family), but it hurts.

Lastly, and the most pervasive thing (which ties into long-term goals), is that I've never been in a relationship before, and I've desperately wanted one since I was 16. I want a partner and a family, and thinking about living in an apartment alone at some point down the road upsets me deeply. I'm 100% not of the mindset that once I get a boyfriend everything will be cured, but I do think finding a partner is a stepping stone in the right direction for me. It's just very disheartening to be actively searching for someone (on dating apps, in person, etc) and nothing legitimate ever comes to fruition. 

All this being said, given my background, what sort of counselor do you guys think would be appropriate for me? I know there are many different types of counselors available, so I'm not even sure where to start. I'm in the USA if that makes a difference at all. Thank you!",29Dec2017,1
