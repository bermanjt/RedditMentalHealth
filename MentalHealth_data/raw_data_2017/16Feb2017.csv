1,"I don’t know what to do about my partners mental health.
He has some sort of depression but has not been officially diagnosed. He suffers from anxiety and has been prescribed Zoloft for it over 9 months ago and was referred to a psych but never took the script or went to see the therapist. 3 weeks ago things got pretty bad and he finally picked up the prescription and a number of days later started taking it so has been on it a week or so. 
A few days after he started taking it went to see the doctor to get a medical certificate for missed days at college. Was referred for another psych and some tests and told to come back. Neither of which he has done. He seemed to be going well until yesterday when he had a massive anxiety attack and came home. He spent the rest of the day/night in bed sulking and feeling sorry for himself. – this is a pattern that I often see without the meds too – everything is great then it gets really bad for a while then he gets over it and is back to normal.
I know the medication takes some time to work and that’s if it works at all. The problem is we don’t have time. Hes about to mess up college for a second time because of it and they simply wont allow him back this time.
He often talks about dark stuff and how things are bad then manages to pull himself out of it most of the time. I don’t think hes actually suicidal but it does scare me. He will never discuss things properly with a therapist either I don’t think. He too smart and will know how to manipulate them I think.
I have suggested everything I can think of. He abuses drugs sometimes which really doesn’t help. He keeps trying to stop weed and alcohol and then things get bad and he goes straight back to them. Hes a little bit narcissistic and a little bit emotionally abusive. Actually hes a lot narcissistic. 
I know he cant help this and its his condition that is causing everything. I know its beyond his control.  What im really struggling with is that hes doing almost nothing to help the situation and I don’t know what to do. I have tried being really supportive and I admit I have lost it at him a few times because im only human.
 I feel like I have tried everything yet hes tried nothing to get better. 
I just want to break this horrible loop and I don’t know how to. Im scared and I don’t know how to cope with this anymore. We have no family so I cant get support from anyone else. Im scared that hes always going to be like this.

I have been consumed by fear and self doubt..I'm having a hard time telling my doctors how I feel...the fear hits and I just tell them the same as I always do. Always about my rough childhood etc..but never about this constant fear if letting anyone near. I feel like I'm ready..but I'm scared to death.",16Feb2017,1,

5,"Hi there. My post got removed from /r/relationships and was told it would be better suited on this sub. 

My SO and I have been together for almost 8 months now and we live together. We both sought inpatient/residential treatment for our eating disorders last summer and have been doing fairly well since then. I struggled with anorexia and she struggles with a combination of restricting, bingeing and purging. Her restricting/anorexic behaviors is primarily what led her to go to treatment.


The past two weeks were rough for me and I restricted quite a bit and lost some weight. Last week I worked my way back up to eating normally. Since Friday (2/10) I've been eating normally and healthily without restricting calories or fasting.


Yesterday was Valentine's Day. My SO and I woke up later in the morning at around 10:30am. We placed a pickup order from Smashburger for lunch since I had an exam later in the afternoon and wouldn't have had time to go out to a sit down restaurant. She had a burger, fries and milkshake and I had a chicken sandwich and fries. This was at around 12:30. After my exam we went to a 7pm showing of a movie. At the movie, we shared a large popcorn, a bag of Hershey Kisses and a large Sprite - quite a bit of food!


During the movie she mentioned she was craving sushi. After the movie she called a restaurant and ordered herself 2 California rolls for pick up. I didn't order anything because a) I wasn't hungry and b) I don't like sushi. On our way back home she complained that I don't have anything to eat once we get home. I explained to her that I wasn't hungry and said to her ""But I had half a large popcorn and chocolate at the movies"". She said ""Well so did I"", signifying that she's still eating some dinner despite having eaten at the movies. She also added ""You never want to eat anymore"", which is valid to a certain extent. Yes, I had been restricting not too long ago but she has seen that I've made a huge effort to stop restricting and have been successful thus far. Anyways, it was our first Valentine's Day together and I didn't want to pick up a fight with her so I stopped at Taco Bell and bought a quesadilla. Her mood improved after we stopped by Taco Bell and the rest of the night went on pleasantly with no issues. To clarify, our plan to go to the movies did not include dinner afterwards. It was totally spur of the moment that she wanted sushi.


Having an eating disorder myself, I know why my girlfriend would be upset to be eating something with me there without eating at the same time. She probably would feel like she's being fat for eating while I'm not. But this isn't the first time she's eaten and I'm not eating at the same time. To me, it felt like she was pressuring me into eating so she wouldn't feel badly about herself. I also feel like she didn't respect the fact that I genuinely wasn't hungry, had already eaten plenty throughout the day, and me not wanting to eat anything wasn't coming out of an eating disordered place.


A few things to keep in mind:


• We frequently eat separately so it's not like she's not used to eating alone.


• This isn't the first time she's been upset because I wasn't eating with her, despite the fact I've recently eaten or have not been hungry. This particular incident really stood out to me because I had just been eating a lot of food continuously for 2 hours during the movie.


• Whether it's intentional or not, I feel like she's emotionally blackmailing/guilting me into eating.


• We're both in regular therapy (separately with different therapists). I'll definitely be talking to my therapist about this the next time I see her.


• When she was placing the order she didn't ask me if I wanted anything. I could have gotten a chicken dish or something had I actually been hungry. But I just think it's weird that me not eating anything was only an issue after she placed and picked up the order. So her being upset that I wasn't eating anything was totally a shock to me and I feel like it came out of nowhere.


• If I had to guess I'd say we're roughly the same BMI but she's almost half a foot taller than me. I don't think she understands that because I'm significantly shorter than her, I don't need to eat as many calories as she would.


tl;dr: Me and my SO both are recovering from eating disorders and she gets upset if I don't eat when she wants to eat, even if I say I'm not hungry/I've eaten recently. I'm not sure how to address my feelings without making her feel bad.",16Feb2017,2,
6,"I've been really struggling lately. I am awaiting a decision that could affect my financial life but it'll take at least two weeks until I know what that is. I have been diagnosed with BPD and PTSD, and a possible diagnosis of OCD, so getting through each day with this impending decision is making me go absolutely crazy. I've been double and triple checking all my sources, anxiously obsessing over every little thing. I've gone into spirals of despair and ended up in hospital via ambulance last week. I need to know how to get through each day so I can swallow the hours whole instead of the other way around. 

I've been written off work, so my days are free. I don't have any money at all at the moment, so travelling is out of the question. I have a housemate, she works full time. Other friends of mine live a distance that I'd have to pay to go and see them. 

Your help is really appreciated, and I hope answers here can help other people too. ",16Feb2017,1,

8,"I'm writing this high right now, so excuse if I repeat myself or misspell something. I'm 30 years old and I have a problem. I don't have any motivation to accomplish anything. I have accomplished a few things in my life, mainly barely graduating college. I've had a few jobs over the years, but never was able to achieve the type of success I wanted, or the type my parents had (who are both professionals).

Growing up, before weed, I was the type of kid that teachers liked. I didn't kiss ass, and was kind of a rebel, but I respected my teachers and did my work. I was considered a ""smart kid"" and was told that by many people. I think this got to my head a little. 

Throughout my life, however, I've had this lingering anxiety, nervousness, and impulsivity which collectively has ruined almost everything in my life. Even before weed I was super self-conscious and felt almost at war with the world around me. I started expecting the worst from social situations and became very reclusive and anti-social. I had my own group of friends, but all my friends were always people I could easily control, or at least were of much less intelligence. I also made friends with all the bad kids, the ones who were ""misunderstood"" because I felt like I was always misunderstood. 

So, through high school I kind of rebelled against my own social angst and became a sort of ""bad boy"" I began smoking weed at 15.  This has never stopped since then, at least not more than 2 months (due to vacation overseas). BTW I moved from Eastern Europe to Canada, to the US, and a few different states. So I've kind of always had to readjust to new social situations and customs throughout my life. Sorry, going on a tangent here - I'm high. So I started smoking weed at 15. It was a miracle drug. I had been so depressed and full of anxiety. But I hid that with arrogance and intelligence. I made myself seem uninterested, not nervous. Some people might say I was aloof. But inside me was constant anxiety and stress. Weed relieved that. It instantly made me happy. It took away the dark clouds and made me see the beauty in life, and made me enjoy living for the moment. Before, I would lay in bed and hope I would die, and just feel sorry for myself. Weed brought out a different side of me. 

But I was saying, I was always the ""smart"" kid. Took a bunch of AP courses, got good SAT scores, got into a good college. When I started smoking and my rebel side took over, I became obsessed with what I looked like, working out. I was still super self-conscious and would even skip class if I didn't look right that day or if I was feeling extra anxious. I would find any excuse not to go to class. I missed exams like that, failed multiple classes. I got through college, but barely. Then I became dependent on weed. It quickly made me more introverted in some ways. I would get stuck in the house for 2 or 3 days. I would feel nervous going around people, going grocery shopping, etc. Alcohol would relieve this completely, but surprisingly, I never picked up alcohol like I did weed. Weed is an everyday thing with me. Sometimes I even blaze before work. 

Jumping ship a little bit....

Now, I picked a terrible degree for my personality type: marketing. I didn't think that the majority of jobs out there for marketing would involve sales. So, being kind of an introvert and insecure, I avoided most jobs like that. As a result, I ended up working a few different pretty low paying jobs that have nothing to do with business or marketing. 

Currently I'm studying to be a programmer but I'm finding it very difficult to concentrate. I haven't done an honest day of studying in many years. I can not put forth more than 1 hour of concentration, but most of the time I can do no more than 10 minutes. My mind is always going toward the familiar, the easy, the lazy route. I do everything to avoid work. I can't get anything done. I'm high 24/7 basically. 

I tried quitting dozens of times over the last 5 years. Every time obviously failed. The longest I did it for was about 4 months, during which time it was hell. I had sever panic attacks, I couldn't drive without hyperventilating (even though I love driving and am not afraid at all of driving). I became a hypochondriac. My heart would skip beats. I ended up having to go on a small dose SSRI and Ativan to stop this dreaded panic disorder that developed when I stopped smoking weed. I really thought I was dying for a while. 

Life got so bad when I tried quitting. I was super stressed out, I had a new job, living with my gf at my parent's house. I was just a mess. I had thoughts like ""what am I living for? Is this what life is going to be like? I hate this."" I became violent at times, on inanimate objects.  I've had issues with anger all my life. In my early to mid 20's, and even now sometimes, I always ended up busting my knuckles from my anger. Punching walls, doors, brick, concrete, car, etc. 

So basically, what I'm saying here with my half delusional mind, is that I'm fucked up and I probably left half of what I wanted to say out... but just wanted to know if there is any hope. I highly doubt there is anyone like me, like my situation, who had everything sort of going right and then did a 180 degree turn and lost it. I feel like such a disappointment to my family. I should have been so much more than what I am... and I feel lost and without a cause, literally. 

This is way too long by now, but at least I got some of it down and I can face myself hopefully. I need to wake up out of this self-imposed delusion and get shit done. ",16Feb2017,1,

14,"I'm not sure if this is simply a benign fetish or a sign of something sinister. I'm still a teenager, so maybe this is just my hormones. Ever since I've started puberty and began feeling sexual attraction, I've had fantasies of unconscious sexual partners. I would strangle them, kiss them, fondle their body, and satisfy my sexual desires without them knowing. Then, I would even dismember their bodies. I'm not interested in macabre things, such as the supernatural or horror movies, so I have NO idea how the mutilation and necrophilia emerged. The biggest problem with this is...I'm a girl, and ALL these fantasies involve other girls. So I implore you not to condemn me as a sick pig. I'm not a guy. I'm a teenage girl. My need for control and loneliness are manifested in these fantasies of sexual dominance. I can never connect to people without feeling artificial and have always been a reclusive individual. Obviously, I've never dated before and am concerned that my deviant lust will hinder my relationships with others. I would have to put on a mask of normality everywhere I go. Talking to other girls can conjure up these heinous images within my mind, frightening myself, to the point where I'm scared that I might harm others. Deep down, I do enjoy them as they're filled with excitement, and once again, there is just something comforting about knowing that I'm in control for once. All I want is someone to hold, cherish, and who will never leave me. Hopefully, though, they remain fantasies and nothing else. Ever. I'm a teenage girl. NOT a guy! I'm 15 yrs old.

1/20 times I do something I actually plow through the work. (I'm talking about academics) Now the challenge is to get myself to do things right those 19/20 times!

I went through a denial phase when I realized that I have to take a course again. I was like ""maybe I should just switch out of ECE.""

I'm taking it again this semester and got my first test back. I got a mid B on it. I'm disappointed. I need an A in this class to offset that failure that I had last semester.

And its not like I got only a B while doing 100s of other productive things in life.

I just have my sorry ass at home wasting my time on the internet. Its compulsive as fuck.

I recently quit video gaming. But I realized that the time I waste gaming is spent doing other stupid shit. Like going online, having a super elaborate meal, etc.

And its not just being a bad test taker. Its not like I'm working on some incredible personal projects either like some of my more successful peers have.

I've always failed in life. Throughout middle school, high school, etc. I didn't even get into this school initially. I had to go to my backup school and transfer here which I even think I was a bit lucky.

24,"Hello all,

This is my first post on this sub. All of the distress chat lines that I looked up were unavailable to me, as I am currently on vacation in Cuba. I'm not entirely sure if this is appropriate, but I thought it was a way to reduce my anxiety levels right now. Mods, if there is someplace better for this, please feel free to redirect me to it. 

I should preface this by saying that this is most certainly not a usual circumstance. My partner and I do enjoy each other's company. I feel that while abroad, my anxiety levels skyrocket, and I'm on edge more that I probably should be. 

So as I said, Cuba. Lovely place. I'm from Canada, so to say it is a bit of a change of scenery and pace may be an understatement. The first few days were swell. There is a group of 40-50 of us here for a wedding, which was yesterday. Keep in mind hey I know maybe 10 of these. 

I'm not a particularly social person, yet more social than I used to be. I've been trying to get to know my partner's group of friends over the past half year or so. I feel that I don't fit in at all. They're interested in getting drunk and high, while I'm more interested in the culture and people, mixed in with a bit of relaxing. I drink a little bit, maybe 2-3 per day maximum. I don't do any more than that, as I feel it effects my mental health in a very negative way. 

Back to the wedding! The ceremony was simple and beautiful. Afterwards there was a bit of a break (nap time!), and then the reception dinner. No problem, I like food. At this point I'm pretty damn tired, as I usually sleep 10 or so hours per night, otherwise I'm unable to function well. 

My partner wants to go to the disco at 11PM, have a couple drinks, and then come back to the room. He likes hanging out with his friends, but at the same time me as well. We say goodbye and I get some shut eye. 

I wake at around 3AM, he's not back yet. I went down to the lodge where the disco was, there are a couple of strangers there, nobody that I recognize. My mind starts racing. I'm worried that he's taken drugs, or gotten so drunk to the point that something has happened. 

I start walking around, looking in all the bars of the resort, everything is deserted. At this point, I'm so angry that when I find him, I'll throw a drink in his face. I have to talk to the best man (really drunk), to find out that there are a bunch of people in the bridal suite partying. I march upstairs, go to the balcony, and there he is. 

Everyone is happy to see me, but I'm not so happy to see them. He doesn't understand why I'm so upset, and frankly, neither do I. My mind is playing tricks on me, and I know that, but it's overtaken my logic completely. 

He said that he was ""going to have a couple drinks"", and then come back to the room, so 1.5-2 hours maybe, if that? He keeps repeating that he doesn't understand why I'm upset. I was worried sick. He wasn't where he said he would be. Why didn't he at least come back to the room and say that he was going to be somewhere else? 

By this time, we are back at our room. He's drunk, and puking. Supposedly we were going to have sex when he got back. I guess not. He knows that I'm upset, and tries to calm me down. In the process, he calls me by his ex-girlfriend's name. 

I have issues with suicidal and homocidal ideation. I mention to him that I'm not feeling well, and may need to go back to Canada, or at least a hospital. I think because he's drunk he doesn't think much of it. I haven't felt this way in at least a couple of years. This upset, this confused. I know for a fact that it's my imbalanced brain that makes me think and do irrational things, and usually I'm fairly good at controlling it, through medication and therapy. This time I snapped. 

Hopefully I can try to explain to him in more detail why I was so worried. I may also put it down in writing so that I can better articulate my thoughts. He will never fully understand what my mind thinks, but it may help. 

We are going to old Havana on Friday. I'm hoping I will feel better by then. 

If you've made it this far in my post - wow, thank you. You're a very kind person.

I used to be bright, intelligent, happy and very emotional and empathic person. Now I'm nothing of those, I'm just a mess.

Like I stated, I have alots of issues i.e memory, attention, concentration, cognition, emotional bluntness.. Could keep the list going IF I COULD, but I keep getting mentally blocked every time I try to write my symptoms. It seems like I've fried my brain somehow (used to smoke weed alot, but had to stop due becoming too aware of everything). I've recently (2,5 months ago) stopped using benzos c/t and I know it can cause huge issues even if tapered, but this just seems to be something else. Something that might've been worsened by benzo withdrawal, but I think it was there before.

I'm too aware of my problems, maybe because I didn't used to have these problems that I now wrestle with. I used to be able to describe what my symptoms were, but I can't do that anymore. I think this is some sort of depersonalization without the feelings of being outside of myself, but still being over-aware of everything that's happening. I question everything I do, I keep ruminating over stupid things, I over-think and -analyze everything to the extent that I've lost all the happines in my life. I would like to help myself; meditate, mindfulness, excercise, eat healthy; but everything just seems so fu*king huge and overwhelming that I just can't start doing anything. I've tried taking baby steps, and managed to do something like 5-10 minutes of deep breathing in the evening before bed and eating more healthier, but I get bored of it very easily and start slipping back to being miserable victim. I feel so powerless. This text, jesus, I can't even think how messy and badly it's written, but I don't care about that either anymore. I've lost all intrest in everything, I used to enjoy helping people, now I just want them to die and stop bothering me. My moods swing from angry to ""happy"" to depressed to frightened to miserable to jelous to (you get the point)... And there's hardly no reason to any of these. I just want to get my old self back, which I've started to think that it's impossible and that I would be better off dead than in this rollercoaster of symptoms that I keep forgetting.

32,"Hi I'm asking this for a friend in college with depression. We both would like for her to do psychotherapy, but she needs to keep it from her parents. Since she is currently under their health insurance, it would be difficult to hide an appointment with a therapist. Is there any other way she can receive affordable therapy without notifying her parents? Thanks

34,"Lately my life has been consumed by certain triggers that cause me to become infuriated. 
I love people, I love nature, I'm naturally quite down to earth. I love life. And until one of these triggers comes along, it's actually quite difficult to lower my spirit! I'm confident, and I love who I am. I'm optimistic, and think the best of others.
Or at least, I do until certain triggers come along.

For example, I hate it when my parents are concerned about me. They're not even pushy or anything, they do it out of love, and they don't overdo it at all. Yet for some reason, I'd prefer to not talk to them for a week until my voice has returned from the minor cold I caught. Any pity they give me makes me furious. I can't explain why. They don't think I've been sick or injured since I was probably around 12 years old. I'll go to extreme lengths to avoid any reason for them to show me concern. I've even yelled at them before for pitying me, much to there confusement. They had to explain to me it's just a natural reaction they have for me because they love me. I try to understand this, but there concern drives me crazy every time anyway.

Then there's wood, I love trees, but the second they take the form of some sort of furniture, and they haven't polished (so just sanded), I can't so much as touch them. The friction that occurs between anything, and unpolished wood, makes me want to cry, and if anyone so much as tries to talk to me in moments of this torture, woe be them, I fear for there lives. I can get nasty, to the point it surprises me what just happened after the anger wears off.

The same goes for when people rub there hands together. I shoot daggers out of my eyes, and I can't control it. The second they stop, I'm fine.

Sometimes I feel like the Hulk... Transforming to someone that's not me in a split second, and then back again...

It doesn't end there, but I won't even bother describing all of these anger triggers, because truthfully I don't think I know all of them, only that, I know what it is as soon as I experience them, and it will continue to annoy me every time it happens.

Please tell me there is some sort of explanation for this? I just want to know why this happens, and then SURELY there'll be some way out of it?

I've been to therapists, and I'll continue to see more, but still, no one knows what this is. Some think I'm faking! I'm not! I'm begging someone to please help me :((((

I don't think therapy is something that truly helps everybody, or that if it's not working for someone it's either their lack of commitment, a sign of being afraid of change or the therapist's fault.

&amp;nbsp;

I will refer to my situation, but I'm sure there are more people with similar experiences. 
I have been to therapy a few times over the years and while it has helped, the difference was not major. I would recommend giving it a go to anyone, but it hasn't turned my life around.

&amp;nbsp;

Therapy could never solve the underlying issue of my problems.  
I learned how to manage my anxiety and depression resulting from my procrastination, overeating, compulsive shopping etc. and thus, at least to an extent, prevent it from fuelling those problems. I never managed to find a primary trigger, though.
It was also not terribly helpful when it came to my irrational depressive episodes - I could have a good day and the next one I'd wake up hopeless, terrified by the pointlessness of the human existence and believing I have never been or could be happy.

&amp;nbsp;

What has helped, is the meds I started taking after finally finding a great psychiatrist. If I were to say, I'd estimate therapy is responsible for maybe 20% of my current stable mental state. The rest is the meds, that make me less impulsive, less obsessive, focused and emotionally stable.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't want to be misunderstood - I am not advocating not working on ourselves. I think the world would be a better place if everyone (not just people with mental disorders) was more introspective, willing to admit they are not perfect and to do something to improve. It's just that therapy is not the only way to do it.

&amp;nbsp;

I also know that working with a professional can be and *is* helpful for a lot of people and I think it's amazing. I'm actually pretty envious, as, unless some medical breakthrough happens during my lifetime, I will be medicated forever, while it would be nice, to be able to *solve* my underlying issues and never look back.

&amp;nbsp;

Still (**TL;DR**), what I want to say is, there are situations where therapy (or some ways of self-help) is just a good supplement and not the main way to get past mental health issues. I wish more people understood that.

&amp;nbsp;

I surely can't be the only one to feel this way?",16Feb2017,9,
37,"Whoever you are... Hello.
I'm increasingly concerned with my mother's mental state. She has been diagnosed with depression since her late teens. Her last deep depression was 2 years ago, after the death of her father. She was hospitalized and underwent ECT. Around Feb-March last year, I began to notice she started to act strangely. My father (they divorced 15+ years ago), has thought she's had manic episodes before. I don't remember them. Maybe a glimpse here or there if this kind of behavior but never what's going on now. She has always just been diagnosed with depression.
She seemed to have an increased amount of energy and drive to make her business work. She was also getting into hobbies such as meditation, essential oils, and holistic treatments. She began to spend money on such treatments. She also spent quite a bit of money attending a Tony Robbins seminar ($600-$1000 per ticket for general admission) and then hired a Tony Robbins couch. By May, I remember she was continuing on this trajectory and now communicating to me that she wasn't happy with her then boyfriend of 13 years.  During the summer she was away at the camp her then boyfriend owned in another state. All summer she exclaimed that she was having the ""best summer of her life"". After she came home she continued to energetically recall her summer adventures but also added that she was not planning on returning to camp. By mid-October, she began looking for her own apartment. When asked if she was breaking up with her boyfriend... she simply said no, she just wanted space and actually needed an office anyway. The following week, she moved out of her boyfriend's apartment and broke up with him briskly. He wanted to try couple's counselling but she refused. Throughout this time she had also been branching out into several multi-level marketing companies that sell expensive holistic products backed by pseudo-science. She also had to buy these products before she could sell them. I believe she has spent somewhere between $2000-$6000 on these products. Throughout all of this, since she broke up with her boyfriend, she has been on dating websites and many dates. When she broke up with her boyfriend, she said she wanted to be single and live on her own for a while. Except she immediately started a relationship with one of her holistic connections. Since then she has been dating all the time and most recently started seeing someone in another state. 2 weeks after talking, he flew here to meet her. She is flying there next week. 
On top of all this behavior, my grandma broke her back in December. My Mom seemed to see it as an inconvenience. When talking about rehab strategies and what to do moving forward, my mom kept bringing up that my grandma is getting ready to pass away anyway. They have never had a good relationship, but it seemed like she handled this all especially coldly.

So...here I am.. writing this all out quickly and poorly. I don't know what to do. I have been in communication with her doctor through all of this. He is also my psychiatrist as well. He has tried to suggest things to her, but nothing seems to work.
We can't baker act her cause she's not physically harming herself. 
I don't know what to do. I guess just telling you all this helps a little, just getting it all out there. I know this happens to people everywhere and it's just something that sucks but you can't really do anything. And not to blame yourself or let is consume you.
Except I do feel responsible. Maybe I should of spoken up more last year when this started. Maybe I should've called her therapist more, pleaded with him to see things my way. I think he did anyway, I think maybe there's nothing he can do. Besides my brother, who lives in another state, I feel like it's up to me to help her. She has burned her bridges with her family members long ago and all her friends are just ""yes"" people. 
I wish there was something I could do.

38,"It sucks you know. Sometimes I don't even have the motivation to find a therapist and once I do, it's impossible for me to find one. I hate my insurance. They don't cover anyone. And the ones they do cover- they don't answer the phone or they're not taking any new patients. It sucks. I mean, I need help, I often don't feel like bothering to get help, but once I do, it's like there's no help available. Anyone feel the same way.",16Feb2017,3,

41,"This will likely be a rant of sorts. 

I have a therapist and a mental health worker. Therapist is awesome, MH worker is ok but I've never been overly keen. I see her every couple of weeks just to catch up.

I haven't been doing so good lately so I was in the middle of telling her I want to die and she literally said ""let's change the subject. How's that hamster of yours?"". Like I needed to talk about it, not avoid the subject completely. 

I also keep telling her over and over that I do not want this type of therapy that she wants to refer me to, and she will literally sit and debate with me and try to push me into it. I get that gentle persuasion is a thing, but it feels like it's way past that. Almost forceful. 

After half an hour she declared ""right then flumplegrumps, I'm going to kick you out of the building now!"" (figure of speech. Not literally evicting me). 
But like... I was not done talking and we had half an hour left? 

Anyway, after session I cried a little, went and bought new self harm supplies, resolved to not eat for as long as possible (recovering anorexic) and then went home. 

Will talk to my therapist about it when she gets back, but I just needed to vent. I felt completely like she just didn't care what I had to say and wanted to spend this shift having a break from dealing with people's emotions. Meh.",16Feb2017,17,

45,"Hey /r/mentalhealth. I've got a friend in a bad situation, and I know enough to know that I'm not equipped to deal with it. I want to point him in the right direction, and I want to make sure to avoid any advice or feedback that might be destructive.

The situation, in brief:

* Unemployed 4+ years, 30-60k CC debt, has grown obese over the last two years.
* He has mental health issues, though I don't know exactly what the diagnosis is. He doesn't have a therapist.
* His mother has her own mental health and hoarding issues and is kicking him out of the house (he's 32), and he has no siblings or aunts/uncles to fall back on.
* By his own admission he doesn't have much sense of self preservation. He has a history of bad decisions, and from my point of view he seems to have a tendency of deluding himself or overthinking things to avoid looking at simple facts.

Not to be overly bleak, but this is all on a fast track to homelessness and death from exposure, from my point of view. He has trouble just walking. I don't know how many options he has for living with friends, especially with everything else compounding it. I can't take him in -- that would be setting myself on fire to keep someone else warm, as I'm already living with two good friends and carrying a lot of that.

We live in Massachusetts. I honestly don't know where to begin. What are good resources to direct him towards?",16Feb2017,2,
