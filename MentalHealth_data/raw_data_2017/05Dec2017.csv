1,"I was at work last week and my trainer (we're the trainees), a woman, was doing a mock interview with me. Everything went fine, but after we finished she was saying how it takes time to get better at the public speaking and giving presentations.. and I blurted out ""well, you're already good at it"" and she said ""oh, thank you"".  I felt a little awkward after saying that. I'm not sure if I crossed a line. It just came out.  I hope that wasn't too weird. (I'm not even sure If I'm going to stay at that company.)",05Dec2017,1
4,"I'm not sure if this is allowed, but I figured I'd give it a shot. I've basically always been the person that everyone talks to to vent, ask for advice, and seeks comfort from. I have a lot of trouble talking to people I'm close to about what's going on in my life due to certain reasons that will take forever to explain. I have a lot of weight on my shoulders right now and I legitimately cannot afford to speak to a professional about these issues. Furthermore, the free help that I've taken advantage of has treated me like garbage.

I'd just like a friendly person to talk to if possible. PM me if you feel like being a friend in a time of need. Thank you!",05Dec2017,1

10,"I don't know much about this and theres not much info about it on the internet. But from symptoms that I'm experiencing I think I have it.

It feels like a branch of anxiety, or excruciating stress when you cram info in before a big exam. My head feels heavy and throbbing, but not really like a headache cause its almost painless. I just constantly feel like my head is under pressure like my brain is causing friction with my skull. Again, it's not 'painful' but it's an uncomfortable sensation I feel a lot of the time. When I don't feel it, anxiety/depression levels drop completely. 

People attribute this to poor thyroid, adrenal insufficiency and chronic fatigue sydrome however I recently visited a doctor to perform a blood test to test my anxiety/depression levels, and the results came back fine (suprisingly). I'm supposedly completely healthy, I just don't feel like it. 

Poor diet and sleep are also major causes but I'm trying to work on both of those.

If you've ever had this or know much about it I would greatly appreciate your help! Thanks!",05Dec2017,3
11,"Hi! I’m Sam, I’m 22 and for about 10 years now I’ve been battling depression/anxiety. When I️t first started, I didn’t know that my random phases of sadness and hopelessness were not normal. Over the years, and especially after high school, I️t worsened. I used to think I was strong for concealing I️t and trying to deal with I️t myself, even though my family members have consistently been in and out of therapy. 

Now, it’s absolutely crippling. I’m constantly overwhelmed, almost constantly unhappy/uneasy, I have fallen off with most of my friends. I try and talk about my depression to some of my friends, but they don’t understand that it’s not a “just snap out of I️t” kind of illness. I️t invades your mind, and leaches your energy. I’m a smart kid, but can’t bring myself to sign up for college courses even though I want to and I know that I need to if I want to lead a happier life. I’ve always been more on the lazy side, but now I CANT do anything even if I want to. My days off work I barely leave my room and my video games, I don’t exercise at all anymore, and every time I try and tackle my problems, worry and doubt cloud my judgement. Depression drove me to break up with my GF, whom I really love and she won’t take me back for fear of me leaving again, which I can’t even blame her for. I’m not suicidal but I know that if I go untreated I absolutely will be, it’s hard to imagine now any path of life ending with me being happy.

Anyways, to the point of all this. After a severe panic attack and nervous breakdown yesterday, I finally decided to give the family therapist a call. I have an appointment this Wednesday, and would like some tips and advice on how I️t will go and how soon I could see improvements. I know I️t won’t be overnight, but what exactly is the magic behind all this? I really need this to work for me. Thanks in advance",05Dec2017,2
12,"Hi reddit, I didn't know where to seek help/advice so I'm trying here. 

Long story short, I had really noisy upstairs neighbor (Kid and a dog) so I lived my daily life with earplugs/headsets on all day long blasting music to cancel out the noise. 

I recently moved to a new apartment and now I'm on the edge about every noise. Sound of people flushing downstairs, walking up the stairs, cars noises etc all agitate me greatly. Now I'm not purposely trying to focus on those noises, but it's like they stand out far more than it should really be. I'm consistently on the edge and it's driving me crazy and I don't know who to turn to for help. Can anyone please give me some advises?",05Dec2017,1
15,"I'm sure you all get this question all the time but I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction.  I struggled with anxiety and depression A LOT when I was in high school.  Luckily,  I have very supportive parents who worked very hard to find me good doctors,  take me to appointments,  and generally support me through that time.  College seemed to be better for me,  I spent a few months visiting a campus counselor but that was the only thing I really had to do.  Now I'm graduated and moved to a new city but I feel like I'm really struggling again.  I know I need to get help soon because I do not want to keep feeling this way and its only going to continue to get worse.  I think my parents know that I'm struggling a little now but I really do not want to drag them into this mess again because I feel ashamed of it.  Trying to find doctors, counselors,  psychologist in a metro area feels so overwhelming because of the number of options.  Which obviously is only magnified by the anxiety.  Where do I even begin? I'm willing to give medication a try but don't want to start without having someone to talk to about it regularly because its so easy for me to just give up. Are there resources out there that can help?",05Dec2017,2
16,"Awhile back I had a horrible anxiety attack after a too intense marijuana experience. I was eating a sucker while struggling with a too intense high that was causing my mouth to feel odd, my tongue suddenly went numb and my body went into full panic mode. Once I sobered up I felt normal and brushed it off as nothing. A week went by and this same sensation occurred while I was in class chewing gum, i had a horrible anxiety attack that was so intense I almost caused a scene. This scared me pretty bad considering I was sober, I just figured things would go back to normal. 

Fast forward a month, my tongue is constantly tingling or numb. It feels very hypersensitive and I am fixated on the movement of my tongue at all times. I occasionally get a metallic taste that really trips me out, but this isn’t too often. I have stopped smoking weed because it seems to make it much worse. I was a daily smoker, am now 4 days sober and nothing is subsiding. My anxiety has never been this bad and I haven’t had a moment of relief since this started due to me feeling constantly anxious about this uncomfortable sensation. 

I went to the doctor and got blood work done, nothing was wrong with me, the doctor told me to excessive breathing techniques when I feel stressed, but he didn’t seem to understand I haven’t felt even the slightest bit relaxed since this has began. I took 1.5 mgs of Xanax two days ago and that seemed to do the trick, causing me to sort of forget about my tongue, it still tingled but I didn’t possess the ability to care. I’m no resorting to any type of pill to get me through this thought, I meditate daily and that seems to help during the meditation but I snap back into feeling anxious almost immediately after.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me, after constant google searches nothing seems to help. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Is this an anxiety based symptom or is it something more? Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this. Desperate for answers, I can’t deal with this forever",05Dec2017,3
17,"I have OCD, ADD, and depression and right now for the first time in god knows how long I can actually feel emotions and I'm depressed and I can see how goddamn useless my life is how I'm just living untill I'm an adult then nothing that's all my life is and I need help but when I wake up tommorow I just won't care. I'm apathetic. I don't care. My entire last year has been just browsing the internet waiting for the next day to come staying in bed with no plan no hope no desires and I know I won't care again within an hour and I'm so goddamn useless I'm basicly dead dead but breathing and.... 

 I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired but in an hour I won't care.

19,"Ok, for good 4-5 months I have those frightening feelings/thoughts of life being pointless. Those thoughts came suddenly during the last week of July although I was partying a few days ago. THE THOUGHTS ARE TOTALLY UNWANTED! But they make me think that I am actually suicidal and make me doubt because I feel intense dread and hopelessness when they appear randomly. I am so down, my head just feels so sick, everything seems odd since I have been dealing with these thoughts. As I said, they occured suddenly and made me think that suicide would be my destiny what totally freaked me out! But it was not anxiety as I knew it, it was more painful and I instantly felt hopeless when the thoughts occured. Problem is, everything is triggering them now, time, future, music...It feels like I should've died and it is freaking me out! I went to two psychiatrists but no clear diagnosis yet and I really dont know how to recover from this! :( I am just 19 and dealt with DPDR for 6 months when I suddenly became anxious of time, the date, future etc at the same time as the thoughts of s****** occured. A week before I had them, my fav. singer died by suicide but I never thought about it, not a single time, I did a lot of research on him and his suicide...but dont know.

Before August, I already was kind of afraid what would happen after it when I am not 100 percently normal again, but I wasnt and I kind of had false expectations which climaxed in the end of July. So now I have like a weird feeling all the time I look at the date and it is after August, like August had a specific meaning! I dont really know what that is! Is it true? Maybe something should have happened? I DONT KNOW:(
Whenever these feelings hit randomly, it feels so real that I shouldve died or shouldnt be living anymore...If they hit me, it feels so inevitable, but I never had plans! Damn, I was happy slowly recovering from DP but this is much worse than DP anxiety all together.

Now I am so damn paranoid of time and stuff, the date etc. The thing is, I just couldnt focus on normal stuff after DP anymore. Maybe I am really destined to do it? It is just unbearable from day to day. It feels like I havent learned anything from the DP time. I am just 19 and this year was so PAINFUL and it just slipped away in seconds!",05Dec2017,3
20,"Hey all,
So I've been on Wellbutrin 150mg for about a month now coming off of a horrible experience with Viibryd. Additionally, I've been taking 1mg of klonopin twice a day to counteract the shitty coming down effects of Viibryd which I stopped taking completely three weeks ago.
Here's the thing: Although I feel a vast improvement from before, I'm starting to realize that I'm super disconnected from my surroundings. Cutting to the chase: today is my wife's birthday and I forgot. Usually I'll have something planned a week out. I'll sing happy birthday to her at midnight, I'll have ingredients to make a special breakfast in the morning, I'll have a surprise waiting for her in the evening. But... no. I was aware that her birthday was this week, but it never clicked that I should do anything for it which is entirely unlike me.
So, don't worry, I plan to tell my psychiatrist on Thursday, but I'm worried about a couple of things: First, I'm worried that this state of disconnectedness is due to the Wellbutrin and isn't due to the klonopin or, somehow possibly, the comedown from Viibryd (which, let's be honest, is probably over). Second, my psych is about to start ADHD testing and we're both fairly confident it will be positive and that I'll start a new med in addition to Wellbutrin. If this happens, I'm worried that it might be the solution to counteract whatever is causing this ""zombie-like"" behavior and that my psych will take me off of Wellbutrin before I start the new med. This worries me because I feel like they might be the combo I need, but we'd never know (Wellbutrin has helped in a lot of other areas). 
She's definitely not the type to keep a patient on something that's causing issues for them, which is why I'm worried she won't have the foresight to see how it might respond with a secondary med. 
So, should I bring this up with my psychiatrist? If so, how? Has anyone had a similar experience and what did you end up doing?
I feel so shitty for being so distant and apathetic toward someone so important to me (the wife). But I also feel like I might be on the right road to recovery but just need to ""stick it out,"" which is not a tactic my psych uses.
Anywho, I'm going to tell my psych either way. I'm just not sure to what extent and in what context.
I'd appreciate any insight some of you may have.
Thanks in advance!

21,"It’s kind of the age old question and I apologise because this has probably already been asked, but recently my cuts have been on my hands and wrists instead of my thighs and I have people literally point and ask what they are (idiots, lol) wether it’s in front of everyone or on their own.

I don’t mind saying it’s self harm, as it’s obvious and there’s no point in saying “it’s the cat” but how do I say it subtlety? or is there something different that I can say that’s even better?

Every therapist, counselor, and psychologist hits me with this bullshit if I talk for more than a few sentences about what I think what I'm feeling might be, from social work hacks hired as therapists in the field of recovery to intensive psychiatrists on psych wards.

24,"After dealing with anxiety/ depression/ panic a couple of years ago my mind has been occupied with the concept of ""who am I?""

I know it isn't a question anybody can answer but myself but I find myself often identifying with how people see me and reflecting like a mirror back to the world I'm looking at so to speak.

I also get caught up overidentifying with concepts or aspects, so for example I as a person, as me, like nature and the natural world. This will inflate to the point that it would be on my mind in the background in between times of actively thinking and would lead to what I can only best describe as contemplating it so much and then constructing an identity with this concept at the forefront. My hobbies will become centered around the concept, my interests and preferences all tailoring to the idea I put together in my head and everything lines up and feels ordered and right.

Then what'll happen is an inconsistency crops up and my idea crumbles to where I begin from square one and I'm passively collecting information until another concept comes along and that becomes my focus for a while.

It's frustrating flitting from concept to concept and it feels fake. I enjoy learning more about the ""self"" and what the true nature of oneself, or in this myself; sadly I think it's something you can't truly answer as the mind naturally fluctuates and evolves with the passing of time and something correct yesterday may not be the case today.

But I feel there are some core truths/ values that hold fast no matter how long passes. But as you can see I can quite easily ramble and end up paralysing myself with the overthinking.

So I think out of that mess I'm asking, do any of you struggle with thinking too much about ""who you are"" and get caught up in labels and how others see you and how you see yourself? How do you deal with it? Or if you don't I hope you can roughly understand what I mean and might have some information you can share.",05Dec2017,3
25,"I think one of the hardest things about living with mental illness is that living well with it doesn't mean you're healthy.  It means you know how to hide it well enough where you don't get into issues.

You don't stop being a good employee.  You're just a good employee who waits until they're alone or home to lose it.  You don't stop trying to be a good parent.  You just wait until the kids go to bed to start sobbing.  

I hate the term mental health recovery or, even worse, mental health cure.  The only way to really recover or cure it is going to involve a whole heck of a lot of medical research to get there.  Pills only treat symptoms, not the fundamental underlying neurology that is the basis of the illness.

It's socially acceptable for people with other chronic medical conditions to talk about what they're going through.  Why is it so strongly encouraged that we hide ours?",05Dec2017,3

27,"hey!

i've always been quite stable throughout my life, never really thought i'd get depressed or anything because i've always been very calm and don't get angry/upset easily.. but i guess now that's one of the reasons i think i might be depressed now or at least getting there! i guess i've been keeping everything inside for so long and now that i'm struggling everything is just getting really hard and that's probably because i've never let those feelings out before..


story: 

i've been in a relationship with the most wonderful girl for the last 2 years, i've never been happier and she was as well, telling me over and over again that i was the best thing to ever happen to her..


up until recently.

we're both creatives (she more so than me) but recently i started studying (non-creative subject) and i sort of got really boring after that (will admit).. i haven't really been focusing on school and haven't been motivated to pursue any of my creative outlets. 

she's a more *dynamic* person than i am, needs things to be exciting and fun while i (when i get comfortable in a relationship) get sucked into a routine.. i know all relationships can't be fun and games forever and there's always some sort of routine that happens but i feel like i go further.. i'm just perfectly content staying at home everyday, watchin tv, etc.

i hate that about myself, i want to be more adventurous and just overall more fun. 

i'm also quite shy, i'm not awkward in social situations, quite the opposite.. i don't care who's thinking what about me, i do me - you do you.. BUT i just feel worthless, i feel like i have nothing important to say, that i have nothing to add to the conversation.. and in the rare moments that i do it takes me so long to figure out a response that the conversation has moved on and my addition to it useless and therefore i just keep quiet.

for the last few weeks i've just been numb, i've rarely felt joy or happiness. if i find something funny i might do that extra exhale and that's it.. 


i'm scared that i'm just doomed. 

right now my biggest fear is losing my girlfriend, which i think i already have, i think we're beyond repair :(

but also just me wanting to be a normal person in society..


i've noticed that when i drink, i drink too much.. so much that i can't remember many of my conversations the day after.
and i'm drinking out of anger, i'm angry that i can't talk to people if i haven't had my fix of liquid confidence! so i've made a decision that i'm going to stop drinking for a while.. i'll see if that helps a bit but at the same time drinking is what gets me through social situations so it'll be tricky. 


i don't really know why i'm writing all of this or what i'm expecting for in the comments, i guess i just needed to write down what i'm thinking and feeling.. needed to vent a little bit. ",05Dec2017,1

30,"This all started about 4-5 years ago. I can barely remember this part- my mom and dad were still married. A man named Jared, who they were friends with in the army came over to our house and we hung out for a while. That's really all that I remember of Jared, other than going to his house a couple of times.

Soon later, my mom and dad got a divorce because it just wasn't working out. They are still friends now though.

A small amount of time before they got divorced, I think some of these things started happening.

1. She started believing in God. (She's always been an atheist like us)

2. She thinks she IS God.

3. She thinks her husband is Jared, even though they haven't talked in person since she lived in Maine. Although maybe they are texting. I highly doubt it though, since Jared has a wife and I think kids. 

4. When something goes wrong for me or her, she thinks it's Jared's fault and that he's playing a trick on me/her.

5. She says that her toes wiggle when Jared talks to her.. so whenever I see her toes wiggle I just get sad.. It's really weird.

6. Sometimes, she gets very angry at ""Jared"". She starts to yell at him and a few times she's thrown things and broken them. 

7. Every year there seem to be one or two days where everything is HELL. The most recent one was earlier this year when she said she couldn't live with it anymore and wanted to kill herself. 

I've been scared that she will ever since. The whole family knows of this, and we've been trying to get her to go to the hospital and sometimes she says she will. (But that's only so people will stop trying to get her to go.) She refuses the help we try to give her. I feel so bad seeing her like that because I know Jared isn't an invisible god thing. I'm confused and I want to know what's going on. I'm writing this cause I heard her getting mad at him this morning. btw I'm 14.

35,"So my mental health journey started 4 months ago. (22.07.2017 18:05.) I was sitting on my laptop working on my new marketing strategy. Life was awesome. I opened my facebook to see what is happening. 
...The news about Chester's Bennington suicide came and hit me in the face. I started having intrusive thoughts about suicide accompanied by a dark feeling and distorted vision which made them seem so real. I opened google.com and started researching. The first results were 'Major Depressive Disorder', I looked at the symptoms and discovered that I am fine. Then I checked some OCD article and it said 'People with OCD have 10 times higher chance of commiting suicide'. I became even more terrified, the thoughts started to seem even more real. Random feeling of 'Life is pointless' came. I became even more terrified.
I went back home, my vision was still distorted and I felt lile vomiting. 
Now 4 months later, 
it feels like I completely changed. I am constantly anxious(Even can't tell If I am anxious, like constant doubt. Can't get out of my head. Can't imagine future without these thoughts, everything seems dark and doomed. 
Constant confusion If I am suicidal, like a dark feeling which makes it seems real. Constant scenarious in my head, like for example going to the psychiatrist and yelling 'I want to die' accompanied by the same dark feeling. Feeling spaced out from everyone. Feeling like I don't want to get better which fucks me up. 
I never wished that 'I don't want to wake up' or 'not being born' or 'Hit by a car' etc.
Weird feeling as I am writing this like this is pointless because I don't want to live, but I want to. It is so confusing and strange.
Feeling like I don't have a disorder and that is just me which fucks me up.
Yesterday I was sitting in my bed and I decided to go to the kitchen and light a ciggarete. As I was smoking I suddenly imagined grabbing a knife and s**** It felt so fucking real, I immediately went to my room.
I have days/weeks when I feel almost normal, but somehow the feelings are back since then.
And when I imagine my life without these thoughts it feels like boring and like I am addicted to these thoughts which fucks me up. What the fuck???
Constant knot in the stomach accompanied by dark feeling.
What does this sounds like? Do I sound suicidal?
I will probably update that later, because I already have a feeling that I missed something. 
P.S. And like a fear of summer because I read somewhere that most people do it then?!?
Feel free to ask me questions.

37,"I’d like to apologize in advance for any mistakes, since English is not my first language and I am not very familiar with medical “jargon”. Also I don’t mean to sound ignorant in any way, I’m just really, really confused and a little scared and I’d love to get some insight from people with experience.
**edit: if this isn't a right subreddit for this I also apologize, please point me out to a more suitable one**

So, for the last 7-8 months I’ve been feeling pretty down for no reason. Migraines, anxiety, problems with breathing, very light sleep, dizziness, shaking, even panic attacks, nightmares and so on. Since it’s started to interfere with my work and education, I decided to seek help. 
I went to my GP, since in my country GPs are free (if you’re studying and/or employed) and I’m not exactly rich. She ran multiple tests on me and apart from slight anemia, that’s been already dealt with and a hormonal inbalance I was already aware of that will probably be treated for my entire life, I am fine.

After seeing the results, GP said I should see a therapist, because my poor state seems to her like a mental issue and my tests are fine. I am not opposed to it, but to be honest I don’t really know what I’d even say to the therapist. My life is pretty okay. My parents and my SO love me and I love them, I have a stable situation at university and a job that lets me develop, even though it’s not very profitable money-wise. I am an introvert, but I do have *some* friends. I did have some issues with my mom growing up, but now it’s okay.

Like, I have a few things I am stressing out lately and I do have a low self-esteem, but let’s not exaggerate, it’s not *that* bad, most of my mates from uni have it the same way.

Don’t get me wrong, I understand that mental issues sometimes come without a distinct reason, but I just don’t feel like my situation is serious enough? My boyfriend has depression, treated for about 3 years now and when he went to the psychiatrist, he did so with actual symptoms, like being unable to get up from the bed, crying uncontrollably and other things that sounded *serious*. 

I’d feel silly seeing a therapist and going “I have no idea what’s wrong, but my gp told me to see you, sorry in advance for wasting your time”. Is that really what I’m supposed to do? And then we’ll spend multiple sessions trying to figure out what is the problem?",05Dec2017,1
38,"Today and last night have been a snowball of emotions for me and I am not handling them well. They seem to be the accumulation of multiple events that indicate living my life in a negative spiral that will lead to an eventual crash.

To start, I am married but its on the rocks because life is hitting both of us hard at the moment and looking forward to the future makes little to no sense. We have both done things that hurt the other person and promises are made to stop those things but then something else major seems to happen and we re-start. I am the worst in our relationship about this because right now every little thing seems to get me and make me feel negative about myself, my life, my job, and my marriage. 

I do not know where to turn for help as we recently moved to a foreign country to pursue education and a teaching career at a US institution that just opened in a foreign country. We were excited for our adventure and our new life but never expected we would face such trials and tribulations with each other. Now, we are both fighting to save our marriage, our mental health, and our well being. She is doing much better than I am and seems to be much more stable than I am. However, I know she is hurting regardless of what she says.
The story starts in February of this year, when I resigned from a position that was going to terminate me in order to protect secrets that they were holding. This killed me because this incident shattered my belief in the system working to protect people from those that would prey upon them. She became my rock, my supporter, and my everything as I fell further and further away from the happy person that I was through the earlier stages in our relationship. I am nowhere close to being that happy person that I once was and that is killing myself and my relationship.

I have never picked myself back up in the slightest, I have never worked as hard as I know I can to be who I was or not just who I was but better than I was as an individual. I chose to invest in new endeavors without appreciating the glory of what life has and now I am not sure if I can ever get back to where I was. I know we are not static in life and we are constantly changing but being that person made me happy and made my life easier.

To cap everything off on this, I am now facing some health problems that could turn out to be quite scary and quite challenging especially as I navigate dealing with the health issues out of the country and in a country where I am not fluent in the language. Instead of working to better myself, I am choking out the love that my wife has for me and hurting myself more.

Where I stand now, I asked my wife to turn to her church to ask someone to talk to me but things cannot wait until we are home for the holidays to get help. I can no longer stand to be where I am but I have no clue how to go forward. I kept trying for the sake of trying with no direction and goal and got nowhere only back tracked. I know that I can do better but nothing seems to be working, nothing seems to be able to turn out for the better and I cannot sleep or deal with this anymore. I do not want to lose my wife and my family that we are building but if I do not work on myself, everything will fall apart and that is terrifying.",05Dec2017,2

She thinks there's demons in our house, she sits in our sofa for the entire day starting at nothing. And many other things. We've tried to take her to a psychiatrist, doctor, therapy by making appointments but when the time comes she refuses to go. We did manage to get her to a doctor and he subscribed her some pills but she also refuses to take them. 

Me and my family are at our last tipping point and we really don't know what to do. She says nothing is wrong with her but clearly me and my family know better. How can we get her the help that she needs? Thank you.

Prelude

I think the hardest part of living with mental illness is that our success with it is judged on how well we hide it.  It’s not the absence of the illness.  There is no possibility of the absence of the fundamental neurology that is the basis of the illness.  It’s learning how to pretend that we’re ok, how to play the game of what is acceptable for society to see and what is unacceptable.

The good employee stays the good employee.  They just avoid deep personal conversations and wait to find a private place to release the tension.  The good parent continues to try to be a good parent.  They just wait until the shower is running or the kids are in bed to cry.  We keep trying, because we have no other choice.

I have yet to meet a person with mental illness that doesn’t have some nearly unbelievable tale of how they were treated as a direct result of their mental illness.  There is a constant dismissiveness from society.  We are viewed as violent, stupid, and weak.  Our legitimate experiences are turned into nothing.  

I have been told that my grieving process that happened after my father died wasn’t grieving, it was just a product of my mental illness.  I have been told that my legitimate worry and anxiety from not making enough to pay my bills wasn’t legitimate, that it was just a product of my mental illness.  You name the perfectly natural emotional reaction, ranging the spectrum from happiness to anger and frustration, and at one point or another, it has been blamed on my mental illness.

And so I hide it.  It doesn’t mean I’m not still living with it.  But I hide for survival.  I hide because I don’t want normal reactions blamed on it.  I hide because I still have responsibilities to take care of.  I hide because I have to keep going.  There are others counting on me.

Many years ago, my family and I moved to a new part of town. There was a farm down the road from us. On the farm, they had a zebra. For a couple of years, whenever my family and I would drive by, I would comment on the zebra. My mother would respond, ""There's no zebra. You're just crazy.""

Finally, she was looking that direction as we drove by one day. She said, ""Oh my god! There's a zebra!"" I said, from the back seat with a voice filled with resentment and barely controlled rage, ""REALLY!?! I just thought I was crazy.""

Mental illness is like that. The reality of the zebra doesn't matter if no one's willing to look.

I think that we all have a longing for at least one person to genuinely know and understand our tales.  I think that we all have a longing for our voices to matter enough to be heard.  I think we all want to be known, not necessarily in the sense of fame, but more in the sense of human connection.  We want to know that our experiences in life matter, that we are simply humans worthy and deserving of respect and dignity and humanity.  Whether it’s with a life partner, or a group of friends, or with the world at large, we want to be known.  We want to know when we leave this veil of tears, that at least one person will remember us for a few minutes.

These are my tales.  I am showing you my zebra.  Whether or not you believe in it’s reality is up to you.  I will not argue it.  I just know that these are the tales of my reality.  

Beginnings

I could say that it started when I was an adolescent.  Technically, that was my formal presentation.  It’s when the symptoms started happening.  But the truth of the matter is that it wasn’t where it started.  It started when a sperm met an egg, forming a zygote.  It started at conception.

Genetics and the environment in the womb control the initial neurological development of the child.  This is true for anyone, not just people with mental illnesses.  For people with a wide range of neurological conditions with genetic roots, the development is different.  One section may be bigger.  Another may be smaller.  One may turn hyper reactive.  One may turn sluggish and slow.

I was always an observant child.  Always.  I learned very early on, years before my illness formally presented that my reactions to the same stimulus were different than my peers.  My reactions were much more variable and less predictable.  I was quicker to jump to a fight or flight response.  I was quicker to bigger expressions of emotion.  It would take me decades to learn how to temper and control the expression of my emotions down to socially acceptable levels.  It changes nothing about how I feel them.  It changes how I allow myself to show them.

Like any child, I lacked the emotional language to explain the difference.   However, I felt it every day.  There has never been a time in my life where I haven’t felt like an outsider.  It has always felt as though I were either lacking in something necessary for standard success or cursed with too much of whatever else to make it through.  

I was twelve when I formally presented.  I was twelve when the symptoms became a daily part of my life.  Just a baby.  Like any other girl that age, I was trying to figure out the whole boy/girl thing, in the middle of my first major crush, trying to figure out the struggles of puberty.  I had all the normal things going on that any other twelve-year old’s go through.  It’s not as though having a mental illness means that all those things stop.  It’s just that you have the additional struggles of trying to figure out something that takes years to define.

43,"I have a friend who I only know over Discord, but recently she's been talking about cutting herself and I have no idea what to say to her. I offer support and tell her to see someone face to face, but there's only so much I can do when it's someone over the internet in another country. What can I say to her, what can I do?

44,"Yeah, this will be bad and i know that what i did was wrong.

First of i want to say that im not a pedophile, i have never watched child porn nor intend to watch, and im not and never was attracted to children.

Short story, i have a giantess fetish, i masturbate to comics and animations of cgi giantesses crushing tiny men.Some years ago (i was 17 back then ) i stumbled upon a youtube video of a woman stomping a child, i was dumb and horny and i masturbated over it.... Later i saw a similar picture (it was censored but you could see what was happening) on google but it looked like it was proffesionally produced, again i was dumb and clicked on a link, but it was just a creepypasta site with nothing on it. So yeah, i masturbated to a video of a woman stomping a child and now i feel like a monster, and i feel like i actually am. Of course since then i havent watched it and i never intend to again, but none the less i feel horrible. I know almost every teenager used to wank off to weird shit but i think this went too far. Years later and im still disgusted with myself...

I cant even think of dating someone because it feels like because of what i did i dont deserve to be with somebody.

Is this something that was just a stupid thing teenage me did that i should just forget about or is this something that my potentional partner should know about ?

I dont know what subreddit i should post this to, but i think this is the right one considering i started to self harm and have suicidal thoughts since then. Im feeling incredibly guilty...",05Dec2017,3

47,"Without getting into too much detail, much of this past year was spent diagnosing an illness. It's life-threatening, but very curable and according to my specialist I've made the fastest recovery he's seen. However the whole process of diagnosis took a long time. I went for many tests and it left me feeling very vulnerable. Even though I am recovering, I still exhibit symptoms and it makes me really nervous. I spend at least an hour googling my symptoms a day and subsequently panicking. My thoughts race and I wonder if they made the right diagnosis. I can't seem to enjoy the victory of recovery without wondering if it's premature. I think I'm becoming a hypochondriac. How do I get past this? I keep spiraling into bouts of depression.",05Dec2017,1
48,"I've been apathetic, sad and having frequent thoughts of death or suicide since I was about 13 (I'm now 27). My mood can also change very quickly, crying one minute and laughing at something the next (though only through distraction). Distraction has been my main way of coping, just bombarding myself with stimuli from games, reading, music, keeping busy so I don't have time to think. I'm trans and though this has negatively affected me I'm now on hormones and I think getting better because of it, but these improvements aren't counting for much. I seem to be very  bad at handling rejection as I'm still struggling with my girlfriend leaving me a year ago and lately my ups and downs have been increasing in regularity and serious thoughts of suicide and bouts of crying have returned. I think if I wasn't so empathetic, conscientious and aware of how destructive suicide is I may well have done it. I don't have a desire to self harm or experience pain. I just generally feel worthless and very often empty with little motivation. How messed up am I? Do I have about 10 different disorders? ",05Dec2017,1

51,"So I'm a 21 year old college student. I have Asperger's, OCD, and General Depression and Anxiety. Growing up was mostly fine except for some moments in 5th grade and parts of 8th and 9th grade. Depression for me manifested after HS and it took a while until I was able to start feeling happy again. Finding the right school for me was tough and even the current school I'm at probably isn't the ""right"" one for me but it works so I'm content here.

However, during this journey, I really have to say that therapists have completely let me down save for a couple. So many ones were so unhelpful and the therapists at my current college aren't too great themselves. I just can't imagine the people who have much more severe mental illnesses than I do cope with how fucked the system is here.

Medication and therapy seem to be what people mean by ""getting help"" but for so many people, these things don't work and the system in the USA is too fucked to realize this. Especially with people on the Spectrum who are completely screwed out of jobs and social groups because of their differences. It sucks, it really, really sucks and it makes me angry how we accept this.",05Dec2017,2
52,I recently had a severe mental breakdown caused by some family issues I won't get into. I have been doing so well I felt mentally until that day. I wanted to end it all and I thought that was it for me. Since then I've actually become stronger. I want more for myself. I want to live. I want to do better. I won't let that breakdown be the end all. I'm seeing that now as a shedding of all the bad. It won't be easy but I honestly feel a rebirth. ,05Dec2017,1
53,"One major example is how easily ""bruised"" I get, and how affected my sense of self is by how other people treat me.

I hate being so cripplingly worried about what other people think of me. I've read all the articles, self help books, talked to therapists...so I ""know"" why it's silly and unnecessary to be so obsessed with these kinds of problems...but I really feel deep down that I *just can't change*.

I don't want to think like this.

I can at least recognize this fact. But I've been aware of this quirk in my thinking for eons, and have been fighting like hell to make the changes I can make to feel better about the situation, but still feel like I've basically done nothing and feel attacked and mocked constantly.

For example, I tend to be meek and self effacing to a fault, as in, I am quick to say nasty things about myself, point out my mistakes, accept blame, basically all the things that paint a big target on my forehead for bullies and jerks.

I have known I do this for so long, and hated it, and wanted to change. But when I have a thought like ""I'M GOING TO CHANGE STARTING NOW. THIS ENDS TODAY."" I don't believe myself. I don't even believe that I can make incremental changes.

And this causes intense panic, and impotent rage. These are the kinds of toxic, hopeless experiences that make me want to end it all, because what the hell is the point of going on living if I'm so stupid and weak that I will continue to let ignorant, cruel people continually get the better of me? It is too painful and infuriating. 

I'm baffled, afraid, pissed off (to put it lightly), and so, so tired. So how the hell can I make changes, and feel like the change is having an effect, and start to actually feel more (like MUCH more) serenity and confidence. I know life includes pain and insecurity is part of the human condition, but the levels of this crap that I'm dealing with are intolerable and I know that there are people who don't live like this. I don't want perfect, but I do want better.

EDIT: I know that this kind of insecurity is a self fulfilling prophecy because people generally don't like being around someone who is bumbling and meek, and they will often take advantage of you in some way. I don't even like when people are ""nice"" towards me when they sense my weakness because it's just as hurtful to be treated like a wounded animal instead of a strong, capable adult. Gah.

55,"I have just accepted the fact that in the course of the past year or so I have almost completely lost all of my emotions. Fear, Love, anger, sadness, guilt etc. I will give some examples. 
I felt no fear when zip lining and I’ve always been scared of things like that. An important project for school I spent three hours on got deleted before I saved it and I couldn’t care less. I was in my first relationship and did not feel in love-there were very few brief times when I felt a tiny flutter in my stomach. My dog died and I did not feel sad. Along with this I have a recent lack of motivation for things like brushing my teeth, showering, doing my hair, doing the sport I used to like, and school work. I am in high school if that matters. I used to feel emotions and I honestly would rather feel very sad instead of feeling nothing. I am in high school if that matters. I don’t want to be a sociopath or anything. I am concerned that that’s possible. Does not wanting to be one not make you one? What is wrong with me?",05Dec2017,1
56,"This is hard to explain but here it goes.

I'm 33, no history of mental illness, in good health and fairly successful in my life. I have hobbies, I write, I paint, I read and I also enjoy video games. Video games are the problem. Let me give an example using my Nintendo Switch. If I play a game and something goes wrong, for example I die in the game (this doesn't apply to every game however), I won't play the game or use the Switch again until I completely reset the Switch meaning formatting the device, erasing all content, setting up the device again and re-downloading all of the software. Just deleting the saved game isn't enough. This behavior extends to all of my gaming devices, and if I reset one device, I need to reset all other devices even if I've never used them since the last reset. This means I rarely can enjoy my video game hobby. I spend my time resetting, downloading and setting up my devices, I waste my weekends and free time doing this and I actually hate the behavior but I can't seem to stop it. I'm guessing its some type of OCD. In the last few months its gotten to the point where I need to completely kill the devices battery and fully charge it before I can even start resetting it. It is an actual feeling that creeps up on me too, I've had it happen when there is absolutely no reason to do it, and if something goes wrong with the reset process like accidentally spelling my system ID wrong, then I need to start the whole process over again. I can take me weeks just to reset a device. The best way I can explain it is like during the reset process I'll say ""something doesn't feel right"" and boom, I need to start over again. The only thing I can think of that offers any kind of relief is getting rid of my gaming devices, that thought makes me feel better. 
I apologize if this is hard to understand and jumps around, this was a lot of stream of stream of consciousness writing. I'm not ready to get professional help yet, so is there anything I can do to help myself? Meditation maybe, or Yoga? I already exercise daily. What is causing this? Is it OCD?      
Thank you.",05Dec2017,1
