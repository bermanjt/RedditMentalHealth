0,I have never done anything on my life on my own. Had to have extreme adjustments just so I could pass high school. Can't get kids or animals to listen. Suck and cleaning. Have gotten people sick with my cooking. I'm just no good and I can't take and I don't know what to do anymore. ,28Oct2017,5,

2,"I'm someone that, when guilt hits me, it hits me really hard, and I just feel like a horrible human being. It's almost the same reaction and degree for all things big or small.

Today, it's my nephew's birthday. I don't live in the town with my family, I see them a few times a year, I love them so much, but sometimes these things slip my mind, and the guilt is so overwhelming. I have a group chat with my sister's, and I wrote something unrelated on there, and then learned that it was my nephew's birthday. I feel so guilty for not knowing and calling the second I woke up.

I also feel guilty that I don't have a present for my nephew. I'm unemployed, pretty poor, and my sister definitely knows this and doesn't (I don't think) hold it against me, but I have been saying for weeks that I would send a present for her, her other son whose birthday was a few months ago, and my nephew whose birthday is today. And now the day is here, and I haven't sent any presents, I just feel so horrible.

I can't afford to buy or send presents now, either. But there were times over the past few months where instead of going out for tea with my boyfriend I could have used that money on a present. I didn't think, and now I feel selfish and horrible for that.

I don't want to feel this way anymore, so how can I overcome it?

3,"I have a history of mild to moderate depression, but haven't needed treatment for 5 years now as I only ever get the occasional temporary mild episode and can usually work through it just fine. The last year and a half have included some pretty traumatic and life altering events though, and I feel like my mental health has deteriorated. Mostly I feel a huge lack of self esteem and some insecurity, mainly with relationships, and also irritability and some anger issues. I got a puppy and was amazed at how much of a void in my heart that filled up that I never knew was even there, even though I have a wife and child and wasn't living alone or anything. I still feel like I need some kind of therapy though, but I feel like I need the kind that talks through issues rather than just medicating away my feelings and leaving me numb.

9,"Hey there, I've been having issues showing empathy. Basically I have trouble remembering to check in with my fiancé about things she is going through in life and making sure she is okay.

I know I care about her so I don't know why I don't keep her top of mind. This has caused a serious strain on our relationship and i'm not sure if I am unable to feel motivated enough to be proactive about making her feel better.

I also have a really hard time ever recalling things we have talked about. My memory doesn't serve me all that well which is pretty concerning at 25 years old.

Some people will say ""oh you're just a typical man,"" but I don't think that's the case. I know I care deeply about her but really can't figure out why I haven't been prioritizing her in my life.

My issues always become precedent over hers and she has no problem dropping everything to try and comfort me but I have trouble doing the same. Basically if she does something that upsets me and then something traumatic happens to her I hold onto that anger rather than being more concerned with her feelings.

I don't like this about myself and think it is an issue. I am not sure why I am this way, but I have had a traumatic experience when I was younger.

When I was 17 years old I had accidentally gotten the ""love of my life""/high school sweet heart pregnant. We had been dating for about 5 years and had gone through everything together. We were best friends and the only relationship I had ever been in really. We had the occasional on/off high school type of relationship but mostly dated consistently.

When we found out that she was pregnant we both felt so trapped by the situation and didn't know what to do. We decided to tell our parents at the time and I remember the disappointing look on my father's face vividly. I was absolutely crushed by what had happened. I was so young at the time and scared beyond belief. A lot of what I remember feels more like a blur at this point.

From what I remember, she decided that she wanted to get an abortion. No ifs ands or buts. I remember trying to be supportive in keeping the child or even offering the idea of allowing someone to adopt the child. She had always dreamed about playing volleyball in college and didn't want to have to deal with the embarrassment she felt she would receive from her family/friends/community/catholic religion (you name it).

I felt like I had disappointed my parents and totally fucked over our lives due to our mistake. Basically my parents and hers made sure that nobody would talk about it ever happening and to keep it a secret. Needless to say our long relationship ended up coming to an end a year later. She ended up wanting to go to college out of state to play volleyball and my feelings for her and our relationship changed dramatically over that next year. I never really got to process those feelings at such a young age and never wanted to talk about it to anyone in fear I may disappoint our families or cause more drama/issues if the word got out. I never talked to a professional therapist about what had happened and had to learn to cope with it all by myself.

I think this may have had a lasting effect on my life caused by a ""traumatic"" event. My memory is complete crap, my relationships have suffered, I lack empathy and the ability to help people cope with their hard times, and i'm not sure what to do about it all. I'd like to know if people have ever felt similar to me and what they ended up doing. I used to be a lot happier and relational with people. I was more extroverted and believe that I have changed dramatically from this event.

I don't want my relationships to suffer. I don't want my memory to be an issue in my relationship now. I want to be able to be there and show love to my current fiancé and be able to put my issues aside. Hopefully my summary of my own experience can help start a discussion that is positive.",28Oct2017,3,
10,"I don’t really know where to begin. Everything just feels so fucked all the time. 

I’m 17, F, I’ve been sexually assulted 3 times in my life. 

The first was for about a year when I was 9, by two girls a year older than me. I repressed that memory until I was 15 and I was forced to see one of them in class every day. 

This year I was assaulted again by a male friend when I was drunk. I woke up during and couldn’t move. I eventually got away, and this time there was police involvement.  I since got diagnosed with PTSD and depression. 

I didn’t manage to sleep, I couldn’t be in a bed, I was terrified constantly. I didn’t want to talk to my friends, I was afraid of them, and I hated myself for being afraid at the same time. 

I began to recover. I was in counselling already due to an eating disorder and anxiety. I started talking to my friends again. I became friends with a guy who’s girlfriend had a PTSD diagnosis as well. He seemed to get it. He then also sexually assaulted me. I said no 16 times. 

Soon after I had a suicide attempt. I took about 50 pills and ended up in hospital. I stayed there for 2 days before being released. 

It’s been about a month and I really thought I was doing better. But everything feels so exhausting. I never want to get out of bed. I’m scared to go outside. I feel blank or I’m sobbing. There’s times I’m happy, yeah sure, but it fades really fast. I’m just so tired. 

My parents are scared of who I talk to, where I go, it’s like I’m 10 again. I understand why, I put them through shit, but it doesn’t help. I don’t know what I’m doing or how to get better. I feel so small and tired and like it’s gonna be this way forever. 

Part of me wants to just give up but I can’t have another attempt because it’d destroy my family. My parents said they couldn’t stay married if that happened. That they couldn’t forgive me. They can barely forgive me now. 

I have meds I’m supposed to talk but they make me feel different. They make the blank bigger, and I can’t cry. I don’t know how to function.

I just came here from reading an article about how families of people with BPD often hold back their progress. It reminded me of so much past shit, and it honestly made me incredibly anxious. I get this way a lot, when ever I try to read literature on my disorder. 

It's happened with books about adult children of alcoholics, and toxic parents. It's happened reading about children who had parents with bipolar disorder, which my mother has. I can only read a little bit before I get triggered to all hell.

12,Hey everyone! This is my first time posting on this Subreddit and I'm hoping I can get some advice. I'm an 18 year old male who just graduated high school a few months ago. My mother is a stay at home mom in her early sixties who had a very tough childhood. She was mentally and physically abused throughout her childhood and teenage years and ended up running away from home and living in a shelter. Her father (my grandfather) was an alcoholic who lost his life to the addiction. She tried to escape these things with drugs and by ignoring the problems and through it all developed some serious issues which have got worse over the last half decade because of age. One of which is an unreasonable fear of the world in general and a fear for my safety. Whenever I leave the house I have to keep in communication with her every hour or she begins to panic. Same with telling her exactly where I'm going. One of my passions is running and anytime I go for a run she forces me to carry dog spray and a whistle even if I'm going running somewhere extremely safe (not on a trail). She spends a lot of time watching the news and on Facebook which only add to her paranoia about the world and how dangerous everything is. There are many other examples of small unreasonable things her anxiety forces her to enforce but I just wanted to cover the main ones. She has other issues like freaking out over tiny things and not listening to what others are saying but I'm not sure if those are anxiety related. I have ADHD so it can be tough sometimes working through things when we have a disagreement. My father doesn't help much because he is more of a beta male type who likes to ignore the problem and retreat to his own space without having to say much. My parents aren't willing to participate in any kind of therapy nor can we afford such things. If anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! ,28Oct2017,3,

15,"Super long. Please stick with me here a minute.

I am at a loss and not sure how to help her. She's had a bit of a rough go through life (father suicide, brother ran away, she was homeless for a while, raped, severe anxiety and it seems every few months an old friend dies from suicide or overdose).

She has been taking severe panic attacks at work for about a year and keeps missing time. She recently got put on leave for about 2 months and just returned. 

We haven't spoken much in about 6 months due to a pretty big argument. We started talking a few weeks ago bit by bit. She called me up the other night crying and needed me to come get her from work and bring her home because she said she couldn't cross the bridge - if she went on it she was going to jump. So I brought her home and sat with her for a couple hours until she calmed down and I went home. I was last on her list of people to call.

Two days later she was talking on the phone with a friend she just had a big argument with a few weeks prior just basically both saying they're sorry for the argument and in the middle of it she told him she was going to kill herself. She walked out into a lake behind her house while on the phone (she can't swim - it wasn't a deep lake but she's short) and I guess he drove down to her house, pulled her out and took her to the hospital where she stayed the night.

She keeps going to her doctor and stuff telling them she is going to kill herself and needs help. She's called the suicide hotline a few times and told me they're always just acting annoyed or something. Her doctors don't do anything except give her new med or higher dosage. She has been to I think 4 shrinks now and only 1 meeting with each of them. She has told her doctor 3 times she will kill herself soon if they can't help her.

She suffers from depression and anxiety. Recently she told me she may have paranoid schizophrenia. She mentioned when she told me about trying to drown herself that the doctor told her she couldn't be agoraphobic because of the way she was acting, but never mentioned it before. 

I don't know where to begin to help her. I think she wants to be institutionalized or whatever for a bit but they keep sedating her and sending her home whenever she goes to the hospital. She keeps telling me she is broken and can't be fixed. 

**Is there a way she or I can figure this out? Can we force doctors to take her seriously? What are some worrisome things I should look out for? Any advice at all is appreciated.**

A few destructive things she does. She self harms (cutting upper arms and legs - recently started cutting lower on her arms). She told me she started talking to a very abusive guy online and is now scared of him because she told him where she lives and whenever she's feeling particularly destructive she'll start talking to him all over again, but refuses to block him or make new emails and stuff. She drinks heavily when our son isn't there (on med too so it gets bad). 

&amp;nbsp;

On another note, she is my ex. She tells me the only thing that keeps her going is our son. The thing is I really think I need to try to take him for a while before she does something stupid but she's flat out told me he is the only reason she's trying to live. So now I'm stuck between do I worry for my son's safety (if I seriously thought her a threat I'd take him away already - she does fine with him and I've been visiting when he's there to make sure, but obviously I'm still worrying - more so as of late) and seek temporary sole custody while she gets help or do I keep things as the status quo and just assume she is crying for attention? If it is all that's keeping her going she will probably kill herself if I take him away. If she legit has no control over herself then I'm leaving my son in dangerous hands.",28Oct2017,1,

I just felt like I couldn't cope with it anymore - my family broke me down, my bullies broke me down and I didn't want to live anymore.

However at the beginning of the year, I was able to get a job and a couple of months ago, I had enough money to finally move out of my parents' place. I am now living on my own in a new city (which also has the benefit of being away from my high school bullies), I have a job, I eat well, I sleep well. Of course it's not perfect which is why I am getting a referral to a psychologist next week to really focus on fixing my life but until I can meet my psychologist, what can I do to avoid being low on energy and really recover from my family/bullies? Should I just find hobbies?

I’m here to vent a little and just have a general discussion. I’m 31 and in grad school. School is intense and I’m not working right now to be able to finish. I’m stressed and more broke than I’ve ever been. I’ve been feeling more “down” than usual for months now and can’t shake this feeling. I’ve completely exhausted from doing nothing, done really look forward to anything anymore and feel like I’m just existing, rather than living. I have no motivation and I’m getting far less done every day than I should be. 

I’ve met with my doctor a couple times now and she’s prescribed escitalopram (generic Lexapro). I’ve never been on meds like this before and reluctantly took my first dose last night. 

I’m both worried that this will work and worried that it won’t. I’m hoping that if this works, this is temporary and things will get better when I’m done with school. I don’t want to depend on medicine to “feel normal”. I’m also worried that if this doesn’t work, I’ll keep having to try to meds and then just feel completely hopeless and even more depressed. I feel like I’m losing my mind sometimes worrying about things that aren’t even on the radar yet. 

I should also mention that I’m in the medical field, so knowing how these drugs work and the side effects is also messing with me. I don’t even know if anyone is going to read or respond to this. I guess it just feels good to put it out there.

27,"Hi guys,

I also posted this in SW.

My first post in this section but I really have a hard time dealing with my suicidal GF and I just want to get some insight or advice here.

Me and my GF, I'll call her S here, are 1,5 month together now. I've met her in a crisis institution (this is where suicidal people go, so they can be watched and monitored 24/7.). Yes I've been rock bottom aswel.
We instantly became friends. Then when I got out (after 8-9 days) we got best friends and now we are together. I know her problems better then anyone else does. Even her parents, psychiatrists, the whole lot. (She's a minor, almost 18 and I'm over 18 so I'm an adult).

Those 8-9 days were the only days in my life I've been ""taken in"". I should've stayed for months but it was clear they were not helping me. They were making me ALOT worse. Turning me insane. It was no help at all! Now she has been on the inside for 1,5-2 years alrdy. She's been in 5-6 different psychiatric hospitals already. No improvement at all. There is hardly any real psychotherapy there. They just keep you busy. Or not. It's all just bullshit if you ask me. It's no real help.

Since the day we got together she was improving big time. She asked to be isolated every single night so she couldn't harm herself. She did still slice her arms instead of attempting suicide. She has ALOT of suicide attempts in her closet. I remember a time she did like 10+ a day...

Also she has severe autism, she doesn't just fit in any ""system"". Alot of the places they put her, they make her worse. The number of suicide attempts mostly increase when she's inside.
From the 1,5 month we are together she was home for 1 month. No suicide attempts at all. She did slice her arm up bigtime like once a week as an alternative to the real attempts.
Now last week she told me she's suicidal again, but she keeps fighting for ME. Only for ME. I'm the only thing making her a little happy. The only reason she's still alive.

But now.. She told me she didn't have the strength to continue fighting for her life every single day. She asked for help to be taken in again, in a crisis unit (suicide unit). Yet there is no place for a 17yo. Alot of the institutions were she went won't take her back because they can't help her. She's too young to deal with an adult facility (she's been in 2 alrdy as a minor!). She turns 18 in 4 months or so and she really can't go in an adult facility. She has to get better by then.. But that seems to be impossible to me.

Then yesterday all hell broke loose. After spending almost half a year trying to help her, not sleeping, thinking, talking, comforting, everything you can possibly do.. She ran off when she was with me when I turned my back for a second! How can she do this to me? I know it's not my fault but damn it really feels like that! I feel betrayed, lied to, ignored, hurt, ... I instantly started looking for her but couldn't find her... (I did actually started living for her, instead of living my own life, I know it's bad but damn it's just the kind of guy I am.)

Cops were called, she was signaled. After about 1-2hs they found her bleeding from the head. She attempted to kill herself. I knew this would happen at some point. I'm so mad at myself for not keeping her safe enough. For not being able to make her happy enough. For being this powerless. Also, have the past months of wrecking myself and my brain to help her been for NOTHING at ALL?

She went to the ER because they still had to look for a place for her. She was injected with valium at the place of the attempt because she was fighting everyone. Cops, amulance workers, even me, her only reason to live... Or perhaps not? So at the ER they had fixate her in the isolation room. This sight still haunts me, 8 people fighting her, pushing her down just so she could lie there on the bed like a corpse.
Then she had a choice. To go back inside by herself. Or to be ""collocated"" they call it here. This is done by the cops and the amulance workers. Also justice is going to interfere then.

Obviously the second thing happened. So now I, her parents, no one has a say over her. Only doctors and judges.
I really miss her, I'm constantly worried, overstressed, depressed again (under control though) and I do get suicidal thought myself again, although they leave my mind just as quick as they get in there.
It's so hard! I knew this kind of stuff could happen when I thought about being together with her when I met her. ALOT. But the heart wants what it wants I guess... You don't choose to fall in love. You just do.

She tells me I'm worth fighting for and worth staying alive for.. And now she attempted suicide. How do I even... ?

Well that's about it for now I guess.. This post might be a bit all over the place but I'm exhausted and crying.



Sincerely,


A guys who loves and really needs his GF.

29,"Hi all. I need help. I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and OCD. I, also, have a lot of anxiety. 

The pregnancy has only made these issues worse, as I've had to stop taking my medications until I can see a psychiatrist that specializes in perinatal psychiatry, or at least one who is willing to treat pregnant women. 

My mental health sucks and it is only made worse by the fact that this is my first year teaching and the job is an incredible amount of work both during the work day, after, and on weekends. I'm a special education teacher with a caseload of 22 and no paraprofessional to speak of. I feel I am really failing at my job, because frankly, I'm exhausted all the time (from pregnancy and mental health) and will admit that I'm not really doing my best work. It seems unfair to my students to continue on in this position when I'm obviously unable to give them what they need to make progress at this point. 

There are a few problems: 

When you quit a teaching job midyear in my state, you have the potential of having your license revoked. That would mean I have a useless education degree that I cannot use. 

I have no savings. No money to fall back on. No rich relatives. My husband works part time at Burger King. He's currently in school trying to earn his own degree. 

The disappointment of my family and our friends is too much for me to really think about. Not to mention my district administration and fellow school staff.

The likelihood of finding another job in my condition is low... 

All that being said, I'm really caught between a rock and a hard place and I'm unsure of what to do. I feel continuing in this position is not healthy for me, baby, or for my students who need someone competent enough to do the job. But, I'm, also, in need of a source of income and don't want to ruin my career.

In all honestly, I don't like myself much. I don't hate myself and I'm not suicidal but I do not love myself. It mostly started this school year (my last year), literally 90% of my friends have dropped or have graduated, my best friend dropped out and moved back home (we live near eachother back home but Im still in college out of state) and all that's left is acquaintances or friends that I hang out with a bit out of school and talk to in school - but outside of that we dont really have the same hobbies.

That also brings me to my next point - most of them seem to rather hang out with their SO or their core group, while I'm here just alone with nobody. It's such a horrible feeling and I have no idea what to do. I tried to join clubs but I didnt really meet people that seemed to want to make new friends (also the club meetings for the clubs im interested in take place DURING my classes =( )

It also doesnt help that Ive been trying extremely hard lately to look for a relationship and I keep failing. Recently got rejected hard too. I honestly just hate this school year, and I feel lonely and worthless.

The reason why Im not too sure if this is depression or related to it, is because even though I feel like shit a lot of them time - SOMETIMES I have the motivated to do something, or sometimes my mind is on something else that doesnt make me feel bad - but if im going to be honest here this is usually when im drunk or high on something.",28Oct2017,1,

When I was a kid, 5-8 years old, I had brief episodes of auditory hallucinations. It sounded like everyone was muffled and time slowed down as they spoke in deep, slow voices. Certain touches and sounds triggered it. Never saw or felt anything that wasn't there. It was all just slow-mo.

That's it for my childhood. I shot birds and squirrels with a pellet gun for sport but all us kids did that down here in the southern US.

Fast forward to 20s and this is the time I feel changed me or something about me. My girlfriend and I broke up after almost a decade. It devastated me. I wanted to die. I was never suicidal but I did pray, to whatever God would listen, to let me get into a car accident or have a heart attack or something. Not as revenge but as releif. After a few months, my memories and physical appearance were the same but my thoughts didn't seem to be mine. My emotions were just... Gone. Again, never violent thoughts but always watching my back. It's like my brain built a wall to protect me from that kind of pain all my senses were alert and my emotions were buried far beyond even my own reach.

Fast forward another 10 years and I am happily married with 2 kids. My emotions are a grey mist of what they used to be and I can actually control them. I feel no heartache, fear, or worries if I choose not to. For instance, my dad was diagnosed with cancer and I felt... Nothing. I love the guy but if he dies, he dies. Nothing I can do about that. I go over and help him around the house and on the outside, I am doing all the right things, but on the inside, nothing.

My relationship with my wife is great but if she left tomorrow, I would wake up and go to work like any other day. My kids do mean the most to me but emotionally, the same. God forbid, if something were to happen, I'd miss them but, what can I do?

I don't think I lack empathy but I'm not sure. I know how I should act and I act accordingly. But inside, nothing. I can say ""awe, I'm sorry honey"" and in a sense I feel bad for her but... It's not any strong feeling if any at all.

It's a flaw, and I'm well aware of the stigmata, but I do feel a lot smarter than most the people I come into contact with. Most the time I am right about things. I'm very logical in everyday thinking. Mathematical, statistical even.

I can get along with almost anyone I meet. I work very intimately with the general public and am always well liked and recognized and talked to outside of work when recognized. In nonprofessional encounters, I'm not so outgoing and tend to come across as cold. My wife says I have the male version of resting bitch face. If interaction doesn't serve a purpose I feel it's just wasting my time.

I'm ready to die. I don't want to die but I feel like I'm ready. I don't fear death the slightest. I anticipate it though not anxious for it.

I'm not overly neat but I am well groomed and my house and yard are kept up nicely. Not a big collector of anything. I enjoy woodworking, video games, movies with the kids, and golf.

I sleep normally, from 11ish to 7am. I eat regular meals like everyone else. My only other health issue was childhood asthma. I'm in my early 30s. I don't do drugs and only smoked weed maybe 6 times in college. A glass of red wine a night. 

I think the tldr would be that I am extremely detached from my emotions as a result of a very traumatic love loss?

It's been over 10 years since she broke up with me and I don't harbor any Ill feeling for her nor any feelings of love. But that break-up did something to me and I'm not sure if it's some mental disorder or if I just built some odd type of wall. 

Every now and then I'll see my wife and it's like I'm seeing her for the first time and this overwhelming feeling of warm love washes over me to the point I'm physically shocked and nothing else in the world matters except her. I get goosebumps and nervous and my heart beats fast and it's hard to breath. It's exciting and happy! But those passionate feelings are all but dead except for a few random times year.

Any help would be great. Not sure I need help or if it could be helped. Even a point in the right direction. Thanks!",28Oct2017,2,
37,"OK I'm at the moment in a very problematic and stressful situation. I[31] broke up with my girlfriend[25] of 2+ years. We share a 2 room flat and for both of us this is in a foreign country. Family is about 3h of flight away.


I found out about a month ago that she was cheating on me. I don't want to get into it in detail, it was just very ugly and I had to find out everything by myself with her confessing to nothing, unless I had concrete proof. I then took a vacation of about 2 weeks to get my head clear get distance and to think things over. I came to the realization that because of how all went down I will probably not be able to trust her again. I told her that when I came back.


A little bit of extra backstory here. She is taking psychopharmaca because of a depression. The depression was diagnosed while she was participating in a study about depression and how it changes the structure of a brain. There where always assumptions before but she did not act on it. But the study appealed to her curiosity about the human brain that is at least what she told my why she participated.


While I was talking things over with friends and family my stepdad suggested because of what I told him of her and the relationship that she might have borderline. His son (has|had?) it too so he was familiar with the symptoms. I read a bit about it and also think that there is a possibility. 


Now all of this is a very contracted situation. It is not made easier by the fact that she does not want the relationship to be over  and overall she seems to be taking it hard. For example making the point that without me she has no one she is close to.  She seems kind of jealous how well my social environment is supporting me. While she only managed to talk about it to 2 people in the past 2 weeks.


Even though she betrayed me deeply and I don't want a relationship with her I still care about her well beeing. And I'm worried. I want to talk to here about seeing a doctor, but in the past she always talked in a negative and dismissive way about mental health professionals.


I feel kinda trapped in a situation where I want to support here getting through this but also want the relationship not to continue.",28Oct2017,0,
38,"I cannot help the narrative which I spew here in rant form, morality dissapears at a certain stress level and this is what I feel.

My mother is always calling me 'insane' 'balmy' or 'crazy' because of a few eccentricities in my behaviour. I endevour to organise my mind and body, consume healthy food and try to live my life in an ocd kind of way. I am informed and specific about things like the fabrics I wear and the types of food I eat.

So, whenever she catches me being particularly zealous about something she starts YELLING. I can do nothing but reverse the rhetoric. I say 'which one of us in this room is insane? The one yelling, you or the calm headed one, me?' Then she just dismisses my attempts to calm her and dismisses logic by proxy me by contonuing her mindless rant. Often intensifying until she runs out of emotional lead to pump me full of.

I had a dream which part of me finds sickening but which the root of me desires. I imagine in my anger that I will pour gasoline on this house and throw a lit match over my shoulder as I walk away. In this fantasy they are not inside the house but their entire possessions are destroyed. The look on their faces would be worth more to me than anything my parents ever gave me as monetary or emotional value.

Rant over.

Edit: I know as a health conscious person that it is their problem. They eat only acidic foods and drink only sugar water. Their brains are shrinking like a raison. I'm sure this is happening because of sugar all across the world. Dementia statistics prove it. People are just totally insular and lifelessly track minded. You say drink water and they say I don't like the taste. People in third world would kill for this tap but you wanna drink beer and eat chicken wings? Fuck these entitled westerners the torrent of pain which awaits this society is coming and aint no Jesus gon be there.",28Oct2017,6,
39,"I haven't been in the right mind. I'm never forgetful especially about those things. I'm 20 and live with my parents who are very strict. I go to school and work and that's all I'm allowed to do. I'm allowed to hang out with friends that they hand pick. 
Anyway I lit a candle and put my lighter next to it then left the room, then boom. I just want to go on a vacation I need it. I haven't had a break from college since o started. Including summer and all winter sessions. I just can't leave the house because if I  so much As try to leave my family will have a heart attack(they have pulled this shit before if I do something they don't like, they have high bp so they call 911) 
I'm just tired and now I'm getting shitted on because I accidentally left a candle on ",28Oct2017,3,
40,"I feel it coming closer every single day. As more and more stress piles on and I don't know how to handle it. I feel like I'm just going to explode at any moment. That I'm going to do something dumb that I regret for the rest of my life. I don't even know what that thing's going to be. Maybe I've already done it. I don't know. I'm just in so much ~~pain~~ *mental anguish*. Every day.

I suffer from ADHD and depression. Though my depression is probably because of a combination of my ADHD and my divorce (which itself is probably because of my ADHD). I constantly feel like no matter what I do I can't do anything right. I feel like a second-class citizen. I feel like I don't fit in in this world. 

I just fantasized about doing something ridiculous to get myself arrested. I fantasized about walking into the grocery store and just destroying the place. I fantasized about handing a bank teller a note that said ""I don't have a gun and I'm not going to hurt anybody, but this is a robbery"". Because I don't know how else to do to get my life back on track right now. And I sometimes feel like I just need to let somebody else take control. But I don't really want to do that because then I wouldn't see my kids.

I'm broken. And I don't know how to get better. And I'm crying while typing this.",28Oct2017,5,
41,"My Psychiatrist prescribed it with 5mg Abilify for schizoaffective disorder...
I LOVE the Abilify, but I hate the benztropine. It makes me so so drowsy and just feel awful the next day. I missed the Benztropine one night cause I ran out and I felt so much better the next day. He said I might shake or twitch without it, but 5mg is such a low dose anyway...is it needed? I would ask the psychiatrist about this, but he's on vacation for two months. I am thinking about just taking Benadryl as a sleep aid till I talk to him..since the Benz isn't a psych med not much risk...
Just wondering about the twitching he talked about... Benadryl makes me drowsy too the next day but jor nearly as awful.
Any advice?",28Oct2017,1,
42,"This happened to me before with my ex-gf.  I've read about it and I'm 99% sure I had a mania love style.  It's still with me, not as bad, but there.

I have this really bad habit of thinking (some, yes, some, the vast majority don't do this for me) people are somehow going to help me achieve transcendence.  That they'll somehow give me meaning.  It's not just women, though it happens more with them than men..one of my ""friend's"" is a philosophy PhD and I used to read his site and comment for a while.  Then I got paranoid and left for some stupid reason (long story) not necessarily related to him.  I like him nonetheless.

Anyway, I've been chatting with a girl via email over the past few months. She studied women's studies, feminism, and psychology.  I wanted her educated opinion on a few things (love among them).  I don't have a full knowledge of these subjects from that perspective, though I do find it intriguing.  I knew what I was expecting, but what I got was a bit of a let down.  It was more of a personal anecdote which is fine.  Then I thought maybe I'd share some of my thoughts about various things. I was excited because I thought... wow! this person must be amazing! she must know so much!... maybe I just need to just give her more to work with..alas she said she enjoyed our conversation, though she hadn't said much, she said she wanted to talk again. She comes and goes. I'm growing disillusioned now.

She's not the answer to whatever it is I want... 

just had an idea maybe I should check out some sub-reddits and read stuff myself... that's tough. It's nice to have someone guide you. And aren't social needs below self-actualization anyway? ",28Oct2017,1,
43,"So this is my first real post on reddit but i'm gonna get right to it because this is a problem I've been facing for a while. So throughout my whole life I've faced many problems with anxiety whether it be social or separation anxiety, for reference I am also a 16 year old young man in his junior year of high school, It was a really big problem in my earlier elementary school years but I got over it and my middle school years were pretty much fine. But I have found recently in my high school career, I have seen a comeback with my anxiety and other things. I feel like I don't really feel or think the same I used too. I've been really withdrawn from my friends, I don't game anymore which I used to be really into, and most of all I've found that I have been extremely critical on myself. There will be whole days where I make myself feel like garbage for no reason and For the first time in my life I actually have gotten an awesome girlfriend too but I feel like i'm not good enough for her despite constantly trying all the time. I have looked up my symptoms online and a lot coincide with that of high functioning depression like for example I never feel like i'm spending my time right and whenever I try to spend personal time alone playing video games like I used too, I just get more anxiety because I feel like a piece of shit. Idk maybe its nothing and i'm just being dumb but I've felt like this for almost 2 years now and I just want to get over it. So if there is anyone who can relate or has gone through something like this I would greatly appreciate any help at all. Thank you.",28Oct2017,2,
44,"I'm not really sure where to begin here. I've been battling depression for quite some time now. I was in a car accident almost 7 years ago and have been dealing with chronic pain that has been continuing to get worse since. My mental acuity feels as though it's decreasing by the day. I don't feel capable of thriving, I barely feel capable of existing. I've tried talking to my current GP about it and it was basically brushed off. The daydreams about ending it have been increasing in frequency and its starting to scare me. But I'm just so tired and I don't know how to fix it. ",28Oct2017,1,
45,I just need to get this out there and I don't know how else to do it. I look forward to the weekend every week but when it comes I'm fucking miserable. Ill I've done for the past 4+ weekends is stay in my bed. I fucking hate that I can't do anything. All my energy goes into trying to be productive during the week that I have breakdowns every weekend. I'm so sick of my depression. I want it to leave but I can't make it. It frickin sucks that an seemingly easy task of picking up food to go leaves me crying in my car and trying to fight a panic attack. ,28Oct2017,11,
46,"Hello-- I recently lost a cousin to suicide and since I'd gone through severe clinical depression and thoughts of suicide myself for most of my adult life, I wish I'd known what he was going through so I could have talked to him. I'm one of the lucky ones who found a way out of it. Because of this, I've felt compelled to write down my story and explain what I've learned in order to live in a state of peace. My book will be available for FREE from Oct. 29th-Oct. 31st and I will be happy to share it right now (also for free) with anyone who needs it. Would it be alright if I shared a link? I really want to help others learn to find peace in their lives.
