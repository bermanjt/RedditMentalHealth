3," I was diagnosed with clinical depression, this was in October. Around the same time, when I would smoke it wouldn't feel right anymore, like it was unsettling, I would get more anxious than usual and I would think really bad shit. I've read that this could be due to low serotonin and dopamine though as it was happening right in the brunt of my depression when my symptoms were the highest (couldn't eat and sleep). So my dumbass decides to stop drinking and smoking cold turkey and lo and behold my depression became unbareable as I was a regular substance abuser. The thing that tripped me out though was how strange I felt when this was going on, the intrusive thoughts and androhenia made my anxiety so very bad. Keep in mind that I am usually a coward and easily tripped out though. My therapist and doctor told me that it was just depression, but my usually anxious self made me jump to conclusions now I'm scared that I'm bipolar or going to become schizophrenic. And well the reason I'm worried about that is cause my thought pattern is really tripping me out, I can't quite describe it but whenever I think about someone I know or a situation I imagine the conversation id have with them, there's always a song stuck in my head, my thoughts are very scattered and I'm still the slightest bit antsy. I've come a long way from when this episode started, my sleep is still disturbed but I can actually fucking sleep and I can eat and my body isn't anxious anymore but my mind still isn't really at peace. Basically what I'm asking is if y'all think I should wait a bit before I try to become a pothead again or I should just say fuck it and try to live my life again after all this time I spent fucking worrying.

5,"In a bit of a FML moment last night I began writing bits and pieces of my life story trying to piece together what made me the way I am. I still don't know but I've never shared this kind of stuff with anyone, anywhere. It's compressed pieces of my life's story. Maybe someone can offer a unique perspective... or not.

&amp;nbsp;

I seriously can't cope any longer with my anxiety/stress/depression and my reactions to triggers are becoming predictably unpredictable. Here's my background, not that it really matters but I guess I just want to share my story. Scroll WAAAY down for the TL;DR

&amp;nbsp;

I've suffered from anxiety and panic attacks since about the age of 14-15 and over the last 20 years I've gotten progressively worse. I'm a bi-racial guy and as a child I was raised by a teenage single white mother in impoverished majority black neighborhoods most of my life. My mother's parents kicked her out of their home during her senior year of high school because of her pregnancy. I don't think that my father's ethnicity had anything to do with it, I think it was the more the whole sex/pregnancy before marriage religious, ""you want to act like an adult"" thing. We lived with my grandmother (father's mother) for the first 2 years of my life which I have no recollection of. My father got increasingly abusive, both physically and verbally to my mother and insisted on controlling every single thing she did. After an accumulation of abuse my mother left. We had no where to go even though we had dozens of relatives in the area including both sets of grandparents, 3 of my fathers older siblings and their spouses, 3 of my mom's older siblings and their spouses, and countless other extended family members. Even with so many family members in the area (some of which were well off financially), we ended up in a homeless shelter. I have no clue how long we were in the shelter. My mom worked at a fast food restaurant and survived mostly off of government assistance. My father was a high-school drop out auto mechanic who lived with his parents until his late 20s rent free without any responsibilities. I don't understand how and why no one took me in, at least until my mother was semi-stable, rather than letting an innocent child who is a family member live in a homeless shelter. It's not like they didn't know where we were.

&amp;nbsp;

The women's shelter matched single mothers together to become roommates and after about a year my mother and her first roommate got a roach and rat infested apartment in one of the worst areas of the city (a major east coast metropolitan area during the crack epidemic). After a couple of months my mom's roommate met a man and left us high and dry. The shelter matched my mother with a new roommate, this lasted a bit longer. Maybe a year and a half or so. During this time my mother and I weren't in contact with my father or any of his family. Eventually my father's oldest sister who was stationed in Germany tracked us down from overseas and after months of negotiation convinced my mother that she should allow me to spend time with their family, regardless of her relationship with my father. My mother obliged. During this time I spent time mainly with my grandparents (father's parents). Everyone else I knew by name and face but didn't have a relationship with. I did however have a solid relationship with my mother's family, who were all financially stable and established. They would include me in family functions and looking back they definitely treated me a bit different. More along the lines of special treatment. Pity perhaps?

&amp;nbsp;

Fast-forward - I started slowly being introduced to different family members on my father's side. One particular aunt and uncle took a special interest in me and offered to keep me on weekends and babysit whenever my mother wanted. They had a baby that was born the same year that I was that died around 6-8 months old. They were super religious freaks who had a church of their own. They were also the most abusive people I've ever encountered. I was beaten, badly, numerous occasions and for no good reason. Just one of the many incidents I still remember was being forced to eat my aunt's horrible cooking, it was liver. I couldn't stomach it, so I didn't want to eat it but because there were starving kids in Africa somewhere who would love to eat their shitty food my aunt and uncle felt it necessary to stand over me with a belt and force me to eat it while beating me. My uncle stood over me at the dining room table with a leather belt and beat the hell out of me. The beating would not stop until my plate was clean. Every bite I took I gagged, each time I gagged I was hit with a belt. My aunt joined in and would slap me in addition to my uncle hitting me with a belt. I was crying bloody murder. The food was so horrible and the beating was so brutal that I vomited all over my plate and the table. Next on the menu? My own vomit. I was forced to eat the rest of their shitty food, as well as my vomit. Then I was sent into the room to watch one of those religious TV shows, the Kenneth Copeland variety for hours and hours. Another time my uncle took me out into his back yard to play catch. The bastard couldn’t throw a football to save his live, unfortunately it was my life that needed saving. I didn’t catch any one of the pass that he threw. Frustrated by me not catching his way off the mark passes, he yelled out “if you drop this next pass I’m sicking Lightening on you!” Lightening was his vicious white German Shepard. That dog had just as many mental problems as these two assholes did. I kept telling my uncle that I didn’t want to play catch any more. What I wanted didn’t matter. Needless to say, I didn’t catch the ball and then got mauled by his German Shepard. 

&amp;nbsp;

For some reason I was afraid to tell my mother the extent that I was beaten and abused but it’s hard to hide being mauled by a dog. After that day I was never welcomed back to their home, which was a relief! Years later I found out the reason why was that my father beat the hell out of my uncle... one of the few times he ever did anything for me. The next year they adopted my great-aunt’s children who’s mother was strung out on crack. Those kids were severely abused as well. They all had random broken bones, bruises, cuts, and other injuries. The 8 year old girl was routinely beaten with 2x4s and molested. All of this abuse went on in between the times that my aunt and uncle paraded these poor abused children around their church while their congregation praised Jesus because the pastor and his wife rescued these children from a drug attic and gave them a stable Christian home. The 3 kids were eventually taken away (by the state I think?) but there were never any criminal charges or jail time involved. As an adult, I really wonder if their 6-8 month baby really did die in her sleep. 

&amp;nbsp;

Moving on - I spent less time with that side of the family and more time with my mother’s family. I was coming from a shoebox apartment with roaches, rats, drug dealers and addicts in the hallways at all times and going to suburban single family homes with guest rooms. What a drastic contrast. I remember always thinking WTF is a guest room? I seriously didn’t understand the concept of a guest room. My bedroom was a walk-in closet with a foam chair that folded out into a single mattress. I ate school cafeteria breakfasts and lunches then peanut butter and jelly for dinner. My mother relied heavily on the school to feed me and provide a form of childcare.

&amp;nbsp;

I spent the next few years in before school and after school programs, not because it was beneficial to my education but because it was free child care while my mother worked. In the 2nd grade I was selected to attend a magnet school because according to guidance counselors, teachers, and school administrators I was exceptionally gifted academically and needed to be placed into an advanced curriculum. In this school/classes there were absolutely no kids from my neighborhood in any of them. I easily excelled making the honor roll, principal’s list, and received numerous academic achievements. By now my mother had stable employment and purchased a crappy row house in another rough neighborhood. Unfortunately in this neighborhood, excelling in school was frowned upon. After attending the Young Astronauts, 4H, Chess, or Book clubs after school I would have to walk home. I became a target for what felt like was the entire neighborhood to attack. Afraid to fight even if it were to defend myself, I was beaten up regularly. Looking back, it honestly didn’t hurt much physically but the wounds were psychological. I felt powerless. I was very vulnerable and had no one to protect me and no adult supervision being that I was a latch key kid. My mother was at work from sun up to sun down. This was way before the anti-bullying campaigns of today. She would come home see me crying about how afraid I was to walk home after school. Her answer was just to avoid the kids that were beating me up. Yeah, that really works in a small neighborhood. I spent the next few months trying everything I could to avoid being seen in the neighborhood. It never worked. I didn’t understand why I was being beaten up by neighborhood kids, many of who I played with regularly during the summer before the school year started. I didn’t understand the aggression towards me. My mother enrolled me into Taekwondo thinking that after a few classes I would be Bruce Lee. Now I was the smart kid in the neighborhood that knew karate... and got his ass kicked regularly. It’s kind of funny now that I look back. They would call me “karate kid” while beating my ass. My hope was that by not fighting back they would lose interest in beating me up. How naive of me. 

&amp;nbsp;

By junior high I refused to participate in my advanced classes. I would sit in class dressed like a hoodlum, disinterested in school work. My main concern was to devise ways to not be bullied or picked on. There were numerous meetings with principals, guidance counselors, and my mother. I remember saying that I didn’t wanted to take algebra and biology in 6th grade, I wanted to be in regular math and science classes with the regular kids. Probably one of the biggest mistakes I made as a child but I didn’t know any better. I ended up back in regular classes with the below average students. In the regular classes where I also refused to do any school work and spent most of the year in in-school suspension, detention, and in and out of principal’s offices. No one could figure out how I went from one of the brightest kids in the city to a complete failure. I was then placed in the classes for the kids that rode the short bus. The class was for the “emotionally disturbed.” That couldn’t have been a more accurate description of what I was at the time. The worse I did in school the more popular I became, the more “cool” I was. The neighborhood kids along with the same type of kids from other neighborhoods finally accepted me as one of them.

&amp;nbsp;

Around this time I started smoking cigarettes and skipping school for weeks at a time. All the girls in school were in love with me, all the “street dudes” wanted to be friends with me. I was finally cool! I finally started standing up for myself and fighting back because now I have the reputation of being a bad ass. I also became a bully in a sense. 

&amp;nbsp;

After missing school for a month and a half, hanging out with the drug dealers in the neighborhood until well after midnight at 12-13 years old. I essentially dropped out of school in the 8th grade. I was full of rage at this time. It was an uncontrollable anger that I would only take out on authority figures including my mother. I felt that no one could tell me what to do, I can do what I want and no one can stop me. My mother eventually had enough of her out of control and verbally abusive son and filed a petition with the city. There were also the many times she called me derogatory names in describing to me how I was just like my father when I was acting this way. I was often reminded about how I ruined her life and because of me she never had any meaningful relationships with anyone. I was that much of an embarrassment I suppose. She reminded me how much of a worthless piece of shit I was. These days I think the reason that she never had any meaningful relationships is that she is also mentally ill. To this day, 20 years later, she lives alone and still has no friends. She hasn’t been with a man since my father while they were in high-school and she’s in her mid-50s. She also has never stood up for herself and knowing lets people take advantage of her, especially financially. These days she’s making a 6 figure salary. 

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways this only fueled my anger towards her back then and I continued to lash out taking it further and further each time. One day a police officer showed up to the house and asked me to get dressed then put my hands behind my back. I was arrested and taken to the juvenile detention center because I was considered a child in need of court ordered supervision. I was mortified, until I got there and saw that I knew majority of the juvenile inmates from the neighborhood/school. By this time I was no longer being bullied or beaten up and I was accepted as a “street dude.” I became a follower and rarely had an opinion when it came to hanging out with these “street dudes.” 

&amp;nbsp;

2 years in juvenile detention then in and out of group homes I was so far removed from being the most likely to succeed and closer to the most likely to die due to gang violence. I became an alcoholic at around 15 years old. Still had very little contact with my father and his family at this time. I struggled with alcohol until my early 20s. My first panic attack I had was after smoking weed for the first time at 13 years old. I tried weed a few more times and each time I would have a major panic attack but at the time I didn’t know that it was a panic attack, I thought that’s what being high felt like. Needless to say I wasn’t much of a weed smoker. I dropped out of school again completely in 9th grade and pursued a career in selling street level narcotics. Luckily I was never busted because every last one of my friends at the time were. By now my mother and I had a hate-hate relationship. Looking back it’s sad. She picked up and moved over 1200 miles away because of a job transfer, leaving me homeless which I admit at the time I probably deserved. I had no where to go. Because of my new lifestyle I now had hardcore gang members that wanted to kill me. I had people in my neighborhood who I ran the streets for years with become adversaries. I think that the more popular I became the more the very same people that I was desperate to be accepted by hated me. 

&amp;nbsp;

While being homeless I became well acquainted with my father’s family but not my father. I lived with a few family members for short periods here and there and ultimately moved in with my father’s oldest sister (the one who tracked my mother and I down from Germany) and she recognized the signs of mental illness that I displayed. She gave me my family’s history as far as mental illnesses and told me which drugs that each family member was taking and which drugs they’ve tried that didn’t work. Apparently severe anxiety and depression was genetic. My grandmother took Valium, my father took Prozac and Valium (later the Valium was replaced with 1mg Xanax), my father’s middle sister took Zoloft, Xanax, and Ambien. My aunt that divulged all of this information told me that she took Ambien, and Zoloft while alternating between Xanax and Valium then later Seroquel. I didn’t believe that I had a mental illness and no one could convince me that I did, not even my aunt that was familiar with my entire family’s history. Literally everyone on that side of the family was on a cocktail of anti-depressants and benzos. I refused to acknowledge her observations of my behavior. I wasn’t crazy like them. At least that’s what I told myself. 

&amp;nbsp;

I will always hold a special place in my heart for this aunt. She tried to get me help but I refused. It was living here with my aunt that I met my girlfriend (and current fiancé.) My fiance was very educated, completely sheltered her entire life, she was the exact opposite of who I was. She is a black woman that grew up in an all white neighborhood, and feared most black people. I found it funny that she had no idea who the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air was in the 90s, that show was considered too raunchy in her household. She was completely oblivious to everything that wasn’t school related. She was easy to take advantage of, by everyone because of her innate desire to fit in, much like me. She felt that she wasn’t accepted by anyone. She would go to great lengths to feel accepted by her peers as well, to the point that no one hung out with her because she was awkward. We met through my aunt who asked her to show me around town. She was intrigued by my story and my lifestyle and the same could be said for me. 

&amp;nbsp;

I ended up moving out of my aunt’s house because I still had a problem with authority. My uncle and aunt were a military family, authority and discipline was a major part of their household. By now the only meaningful job I had as a high-school drop-out was at a fast food restaurant as a store manager. I eventually got fired for... you guessed it... problems with authority. 

&amp;nbsp;

After not speaking to my mother for 2 years we finally made our peace. It was a long road to recovery because of how strained our relationship was and because we both are mentally ill, which incidentally runs in her family too anxiety and depression. We’re actually the best of friends now. By now I was still drinking everyday and excessively. The 1 friend that I had along with my family were all concerned about how much I was drinking. I was shit-faced everyday.

&amp;nbsp;

I ended up joining a boxing gym in attempt to get over my fear of people. Much like academics years before, I excelled at boxing. Boxing helped conquer the many years of rage and added the much needed discipline I lacked my entire life. Boxing became my life. My trainers decided it was time to start my amateur career with the hopes of turning pro shortly after. I stopped drinking completely while preparing to become an amateur prize fighter, and haven’t had a drink since, still to this day. Injury after injury derailed what most of us thought would be a promising boxing career. 

&amp;nbsp;

Welcome to opiates. Injuries = vicodin, percocet, morphine etc... Who would’ve thought that these little pills would cure my anxiety and make me feel like a million bucks? Luckily I didn’t fall deep into an uncontrollable addiction but for a few years in my mid to late 20s I would use opiates as a crutch to overcome my anxiety issues. I was super comfortable trying new things and being around new people. They worked great, until they didn’t work. Still being somewhat of an athlete, nothing could ever touch the feeling of lacing up a pair of boxing gloves and getting in the ring, even if it were only to spar at this point. I continued training and even began training other people. I accidentally started and led a free exercise group that met at a public park 3 times per week. I realized that while I was working out (I’m sure something to do with the endorphins) that I could tolerate being around people and I was social for the first time in my life. My fiance and I were living together and this was the most comfortable I’ve ever been in my life. The exercise group kept growing and growing. People told other people who told other people, etc. Even though this was the best I’ve ever felt I was still battling depression and anxiety behind closed doors. The group eventually disbanded as my anxiety started rearing it’s ugly head again. I would cancel workouts, purposely reschedule, and did everything else I could think of to sabotage the only thing that made me happy. 

&amp;nbsp;

Somewhere along the way of this story I became an IT administrator with a handful of meaningless certifications at a job I despise. I’ve been here for 13 years now. I hate it. My anxiety and fear of people won’t let me as much apply for a new job, let alone interview or dare I say accept a new job. I feel like I’m too unreliable even though I haven’t had a vacation in over 2 years and seldom call off of work.

&amp;nbsp;

2 years ago I proposed to fiancé (then girlfriend). Last year we were expecting our first child and she had a miscarriage at 8 weeks. Weirdly it didn’t affect me much. Life went on. I feel kind of bad that I was indifferent. Later in the year we tried again, we made it 5 months until she went into premature labor from an incompetent cervix. She gave birth to our son who died during birth. He wouldn’t have survived at 5 months, but that was one of the hardest things I’ve witnessed. I couldn’t bring myself to cut the umbilical cord or hold him when they brought him over to us. I haven’t cried in decades and this was the first time I broke down, I felt powerless again. Sure I’m a hell of a boxer still to this day, the last time I felt powerless it was because I couldn’t defend myself, I couldn’t stand up for myself. I can more than adequately defend myself now and I swore I’d never feel powerless again. Joke’s on me. So as we’re struggling to get through the loss of our child we decide to buy a house. Why? I don’t know. I guess it was still part of the family planning routine that we devised. We haphazardly rushed into the house buying process while grieving and ended up in a POS. Our inspector missed a few high dollar problems that we can’t afford to fix, and I’m extremely handy.... just not this handy. I want out. I’ve been 1.5 hours late to work every day for the past 8 months. I’m surprised I still have a job. I’d really prefer to work at home since in IT there’s nothing I do at the office, which is modeled after a bullpen, that I can’t do at home and more efficiently. Telecommuting is completely unacceptable at my company. My panic attacks have gone from my normal 1-2 every other month to 4-5 per week. The vicious cycle of anxiety leading to depression and vice versa has worn me down. I can’t take life anymore. I hate my life. I hate my anxiety. I hate everything. I’m beginning to hate my fiancé who has been nothing but supportive and patient with me. I associate everything bad that has happened to me over the last year with her, even though she’s not responsible for most of it. I’ve tried seeing doctors and none of them actually listen to me. I went 30 years without taking any medication for depression/anxiety and finally gave in a few years back. I feel like the doctors I’ve seen don’t bother to diagnose the patient, they attempt to treat the symptoms, and poorly in my case. I don’t have the money to go to CBT of any other type of talk based therapy. My job cut our health care since they’re not required to offer health benefits since we are a company of under 50 technically (though we hire hundreds of contract workers). 

&amp;nbsp;

Last August after losing my son I had a physical and my kidney function is impaired according to my GFR results. My GFR was 68 and then 74 90 days later. I don’t know what that’s about because I’m generally a healthy person. 

&amp;nbsp;

I can’t deal with any more stress, but everything stresses me out which causes me to have frequent panic attacks. I just can’t deal with life any more and my anxiety has strained my relationship with my fiancé. I’m beginning to hate her, for no reason it all especially when all she does is try to help me cope. I currently have no friends to talk to, no one to hangout with, I moved away from my hometown 16 years ago and have yet to make 1 friend.

&amp;nbsp;

On the outside it’s easy for people that know me who don’t know my past to think I have everything a person could possible want and shouldn’t have any worries. Rumination, panic attacks, lack of sleep and intrusive thoughts are my biggest problems these days.

&amp;nbsp;

That’s my compressed life story leading me up to the TL;DR
Over the past few years I’ve been to many doctors and no one has been able to help with my anxiety that has ultimately led to depression, my depression in turn leads to anxiety. I’ve been suffering more frequent panic attacks and my doctors have given me the following and none of which helped:

&amp;nbsp;

Celexa 15mg

Wellbutrin 150/300mb

Zoloft 25/50/100mg

Elavil - I think 20mg

Buspar(sp?) 15mg

Hydroxizine 25mg

Trazadone 50/100mg

Ambien 10mg - actually works but my current insurance doesn’t cover it.

Lunesta 2mg

Klonipin .25mg - .5mg

Seroquel 25mg (for sleep)

Some kind of Beta Blocker to lower my already normal blood pressure which is supposed to help with panic attacks

I’ve bummed Valium and Xanax off of family members and Valium seems to be the most effective but I haven’t met a doc or psychiatrist willing to write me a prescription for it because it’s a “dated drug” and there are better alternatives (none of which help). I don’t sleep, I haven’t been eating lately.

7,"Alright boys and girls strap yourselves in and let's get this ship underway. 

I've only recently paid really close attention to the thoughts that come and go throughout the day and I don't think they're what normal people experience. A lot of my thinking tends to swing back and forth from topic to topic (that'll probably be reflected in this post) and I usually won't dwell on a certain subject for more than a couple minutes before jumping to something else. Im pretty sure that's a sign of adulthood ADD but I'm not psychologist so I can only speculate. 

Anyway, I want to talk about the thoughts themselves. I really don't think they're normal. They range anywhere from harmless to extremely dark and graphic material, the likes of which I don't really understand. For example, I work in customer service and I literally have to censor my own thoughts when interacting with people. There are some people and customers that really get under my skin. Like really really really under my skin. To the point where I don't really think I'm above murder or seriously harming people. (That's probably a terrible thing to post but I have to get this out.) Okay, before you call the police, I'm not going to kill anyone. Literally the only thing stopping me is the fact that I would get caught, tossed in prison, and would have messed up what is otherwise a pretty decent life. 

This is not normal. I don't think many folks can say they've actually wanted to drive a knife into someone else's body and actually see themselves do it. 

This is so difficult to explain because I know you think I'm a murderer waiting to blossom but it's not like that at all. Even though I can visual myself doing it, I WILL NOT. I cannot. I don't have a total lack of empathy, but I feel as though it's incredibly dulled. I'm not going to kill anyone, I know it. Although it's really difficult to rationalize what I think and what I feel. 

I feel like a psychopath that's held in place by his own sense of morality and sense of right and wrong. It's wrong to kill people, that's why I won't do it. It's wrong to steal, that's why I won't do it. It's wrong to break the law, that's why I try not to. (I've jaywalked like one time). 

Geez, how do I even wrap up this column of word vomit. 

I feel like a crazy person. I genuinely feel insane. I feel like I do not belong here or anywhere. I do not know what is wrong with me but I know there's something wrong. There has to be.

8,"For the past 2 years or so I've noticed that I'm always off. It's really difficult to explain but I almost constantly feel on edge. Sometimes my mind is going a million miles at one point, then I can loose all motivation. I can be mildly happy at one moment and then slowly I'll just feel sad and down. More recently I've started snapping at people for the most stupid reasons.

I don't want to say that I have anxiety or depression from fear or trivialising them but I know something is wrong with me. I want to get help but I don't know where. I live in England, if I go to the doctors, can they do anything for me, or should I try something else?",10Mar2017,1

13,"I want bluntness and deep honesty here because I'm not looking for sympathy. For the past year I've been severely depressed and anxious that it caused me and my boyfriend to break up. It was to the extent that I was taking out my anger on him all the time and constantly lashed out. I'd pick arguments with him almost everyday and I was incredibly clingy, getting incredibly anxious and thus pissed off when he didn't call me/reply to me almost straight away. On one occasion I did hit him (I meant it as a joke but then it happened and I've no excuse). I had guilt for so long over how I treated him and even during our relationships I had massive panic attacks of how I was treating him and apologising frantically - but I kept doing it.

It got to the point where I felt so guilty and awful about myself that i attempted suicide three times within less than a month - I didn't want him knowing about it because I didn't want him to feel guilty for breaking up with me.

I feel like it was my mental illness causing me to act this way WHICH IS NO EXCUSE and I know I need to take responsibility for my actions but since getting treated for my mental illnesses I'm back to my old self. I don't have that anger inside me( which was caused from anxiety) anymore and I feel better. After expressing guilt over what I did people have consoled me saying that it wasn't truly me acting like that and it was my mental illness. I've learnt to accept this but I still can't shake off the fact that i did the things i did. I can feel guilty all I want but it doesn't negate anything.


Even though I felt it was a sympton of my depression/anxiety i can't help but think that it's an integral part of my personality and I'm so afraid that it's going to form its ugly head again. What do i do? Am I a narcissist/abusive person? Am I a bad person? i want objectivity from people who don't know me

I'm not even propely diagnosed and yet my psychiatrist tells me that it's not important what mental illness i have. everyone does the same thing, thinking i will be all good if they tell me i have money, family and home i can go to. my therapist tells me the same thing every meeting. i stopped believing that anything could help me.

16,"Hey everyone, first post here. So long story kinda short, I initially hit mental/behavior issues right around when beginning puberty, 11ish. I continued to fall terribly in school; no drive to wake up, nervous about social things, Around 14-15, things began to intensify a little bit. Depression and Anxiety is on the entire tree of my Mom's family.

Somehow I went from the most introverted, smart kid in 6th grade
to this annoying, disruptive, provocateur. In retrospect I wanted people to notice me and like me, but that's fucking weird because of my social anxiety and rejection phobia. Anyway, first went to a Psychiatrist around 16-17, predictably Major Depression and Anxiety.

First med combo I took was Paxil and Wellbutrin (300mg). Results were an improvement so some extent. I felt it raised my 'floor' of depression to maybe a more tolerable level, but it also didn't do much to help with my apathy, lack of drive/motivation, inability to feel emotions, Anhedonia, self-esteem, inferiority complex, insane Impatience (not sure if med. term) and my fucking inability to do menial tasks. I have a lot of symptoms of ADD/ADHD nut mostly without the hyperactive movement. I fidget a lot and am constantly tapping, etc. My main issues are cognitive. My learning rate is impaired for whatever reason; I can read really fast, comprehend and context it, but for the fucking life of me I forget what I just read. This is also when I'm online trying to research - I start off with 4 tabs then end up with 20 and I'm constantly switching between them like a retard. 

Over the years, I was 'treated' on and off, with no good results. They tried SSRI + Wellbutrin, SNRI + Wellbutrin, NaSSA, Tricyclics. I'm fucking frustrated and getting discouraged - this is a criticial time of my life when I need to get my shit together and work, but I'm a lethargic mess with absolutely no motivation. Confidence is also shot ATM, but I can improve that. 

My depression is by far at it's Zenith now. 2016 was an awful year for me, I lost everything I had financially. No doubt environment and circumstance play a role in Depression but I also think my Monoamines are seriously out of whack.

For example, I haven't been able to eat in over a month, I've lost a ton of weight. This has never happened to me before. A few months ago now I finally quit my Opiate addiction for good, and was TOO familiar with how you feel in acute withdrawal, Dopamine is so low you can't move, and the thought of food is repulsive instead of just undesired. It is a monumental effort IF I can even get my ass up to a shitty 4 hour shift at work. It's fucking exhausting and only 4 hours. Both mentally and physically, I am so Amotivated and completely lifeless. I feel currently like I'm in withdrawal from a Dopaminergic agonist or injibitor. I know the symptoms too well now, and even my gross motor control has gone to shit. Not as bad as full opiate withdrawal, but I', noticeably clumsier, less balanced. 

I have no interest in ANYTHING unless I am self-medicating (not dependent on any drugs so it's not withdrawal). I've let this problem go on for 14 of my fucking prime adult years - I'm 28 now and need to get my shit together once and for all. I am committed but also fucking terrified. 

My Serotonin also feels lower than it should be. Of note maybe: I loved Serotonin agonists like MDMA when I did them, but having tried like 9 sifferent SSRIs and SNRIs I never noticed much to any improvement. On a Sero agonist, I feel 'normal' and average socially. No longer a recluse but not loud and obnoxious either. Also, I don't feel emotions or pleasure anymore and it's just fucking devastating to your psyche. I get enjoyment from virtually nothing, I just try to pass time on the internet, mainly. 

So yeah, shit's gotten severe as hell, I can't take it, need good meds and Therapy. Really the only other goto drug (which I know 100% works in my case) would be either Adderall or Ritalin. My Psychiatrist didn't seem too offended/opposed on my initial assessment. I was honest with him, I told him I've experimented a lot, found certain types of drugs that made me feel calmer/focused/enthustiast to work. 

I'm currently on 60MG Cymbalta, 300mg Wellbutrin, 15MG Mirtazapine - two weeks today for all. Feeling little to no effects, normally Wellbutrin is subtle but noticeable. Not this time around.

Sorry for this long, rambling post but needed to get my basic situation out. I'm terrified if I can't get Stims that I am absolutely fucked. I don't sit around and loath myself, I've tried motivation and being positive but remains the withdrawal-like symptoms. My case is a bit of a paradox I think. Most doctors forget Dopamine is a thing and only consider Serotonin, even after fucking countless failed attempts. 

Anyway. let me know if you guys were in a similar boat and any advice would be really appreciated. 

Also, I'm a total newfag so would you recommend any other Subreddits for discussion of effective medsor just a board more focused on the Pharmacology? Thanks again. Hang in there, we're all gonna make it, brah.",10Mar2017,6
20,"I'm trying to understand a behavior I have, or at least develop a vocabulary to do some research on it. I don't really know how to explain what it is in the right context but I'm going to give it a shot. I'm a fairly well educated person and I know a lot about intelligence and certain brain chemistry interactions but I haven't studied much about anything in this vein. I'm in my 30s and this is a non-destructive behavior that is easy to live with but I'm interested in understanding it better.

I'm going to go ahead and call this thing a tic, though I know that it probably isn't. I've had this tic since I was a kid -- my dad does the same thing as well. When excited and in certain headspaces, mostly when alone, I will start to hum and tense most of the muscles in my body while I get really involved with whatever thinking I'm doing that has triggered this. When I was real young I would flap my hands (like a bird). My mom used to call this ""spazzing out."" As a young adult typically I used to gnaw on the index knuckle of my fist, though I don't do that now. I just clench fists and usually pace. I can stop at will and can ignore the urge but if I'm alone it usually ends up happening.

I managed to mostly kill this behavior when I first started meditating a couple years ago. I would just notice I was doing it and stop and eventually I stopped doing it. I would occasionally feel the urge (most often in places like the shower) but was able to ignore it.

It has returned a few months ago, however. I can't quite figure out what triggers it but it's definitely related to having to focus on something excessively -- usually it's driven by reading a lot into complex subjects and then I really push to integrate all I've been reading by mapping it out consciously and that leads to the excitement-feeling that ends with me performing this tic. I think spending a lot of time researching things and doing computer work (I am a photographer and project manager for a large website that's being constructed) is the drive for it coming back in force but at the same time I've always spent a lot of time on computers and certainly did for the brief period I was able to kick the habit, so I don't know why it would be the sole cause.

I'm mostly concerned because it can lead to inefficiency because I will get sucked into the ""too-excited"" headspace and fantasize about possible futures connected to topics I'm researching which can get old. I need to spend more time in the present and have been working on that, solving/understanding this is tied to that.

Anyone have any good vocab for me? I appreciate any help.",10Mar2017,1
22,"I have written the following for my boyfriend, who lives far away and I have been talking to very little, out of cognitive dissonance. Has anybody else experienced something like this? I feel like garbage. Can anybody offer advice or support?

I am aware that I've become more distant lately, partially because I have been wrapped up in psychic pain and attempting to escape or deny a hopeless reality, but there is no way of avoiding it anymore. Because you've been there for me a number of times, and because I've attempted to do the same, it's important for me to explain. In the last few months, I have been realizing parts of myself that don't correlate with the person that I thought I was or wanted to be. Frankly, I feel like I am barely there. 

I just swirl around in a disjointed daydream most of the time, compulsively looking for distraction, direction, or assurance, trying interests and activities that inevitably fizzle out because they have nothing to attach to. I thought I just hadn't found myself yet, maybe I was looking in the wrong places, maybe I needed to try harder, but it shouldn't be so effortful to find enjoyment. It shouldn't be detective work to figure out what interests me or makes me feel good. It's an oxymoron. 

My thoughts are cyclical, unimaginative, and self-centered to the point of obliviousness to the world, and my range of feelings seems more limited and negative than other people's. I knew I felt awkward socially, but I assumed any disconnect was due to anxiety, depression, even Asperger's or something. Now I find myself seriously considering that I am low in empathy. Not sadistically, but stupidly so. I probably just overcompensated because it was my version of normal, thinking that I was sensitive because I was prone to chronic loneliness and shame. Thinking that I could relate because I wanted to. I guess I thought that I could understand others through effort or intent, but it didn't occur to me that this is a natural automatic thing for people, and that ""trying"" to do it is contrived and delusional. 

I'm old enough to realize that this is longstanding enough to be a problem, and I can't just wish myself out of it. I've read about trauma, neglect, personality disorders, and I'm in therapy, on medication, and doing neurofeedback, which is expensive and not even widely accepted. I guess that speaks to my desperation, if anything. Not that it excuses me from responsibility. You are a good person, and I look up to you in a lot of ways, but good people caring about me isn't going to fix a lifetime of relational and personal dysfunction. I don't know why I am like this, why I always do this. I know that this is shitty, and I don't feel good about it.

Nobody wants to believe that their mode of functioning throughout life has been stunted, shallow, and delusional. I thought it was something I'd work my way out of, through reinvention, through willpower and learning. I'm just essentially running out of ways to reinvent, and I'm left with a void. Believing I can ""solve"" distorted, myopic thinking through more thinking is just dumb. Believing I can healthily attach seems like an illusion, when I don't feel I have any substance to attach.

The fact, as far as I can tell, is that you have an entire world that is much deeper and more textured and coherent, grounded opinions and interests, and it's just not fair to put you in a position of relying on someone who is like a puddle or a mirage in comparison, who cannot adequately share experiences or communicate. I did have raw moments, and feel cared for, but I think I underestimated the leap I was making. I wanted to think that maybe this was a temporary dip or a confusion that would clear up eventually, get sorted out, but it's not. I don't know if it ever will. 

It has been difficult for me to figure out what to do, considering the weight of the topic. I am not the best at discerning or decision making, but it's not an excuse for omission. 

TL;DR: I think I am delusional and narcissistic, and I don't want you to feel bound to me when you have more needs than I can probably fulfill. I'm not sure that I can change, but that's no excuse to deny the realization.

24,"Boy, what  a starting title, right? Sure to cause some king of controversy, but hey, this is what's happening. Now, I'm sure that I should go ahead and cover my own ass by stating that my title describes me, and from my perspective as an author, only me. It is not a general statement about people who are cursed with either apathy and/or obesity. Being apathetic or being obesity doesn't mean you're failing as a human being, but it is more of a self-deprecation toward myself, as well as a dark scientific look at my own experiences and feelings, most of which I'm about to put on display for the internet to archive and observe for the rest of time, God help you all.

Now that that's all out of the way, we can get to the point. I'm an apathetic human being in many, many regards, but all of those regards are generally turned inward towards myself. Paradoxically, I am able to care (quite passionately) about certain issues outside of myself, including interpersonal relationships, even though I can't say I have very many friends whom I would consider close. I'd be willing to go far out of my way to help them if they needed it, though, which I suppose I pride myself on, but it wouldn't be a symptom of what one might find inherit in someone considered apathetic. 

As stated above, my apathy is solely directed inward. I simply can't care about myself without serious effort. My friends have brought this up to me in the manner and ease at which I'm able to roast myself, as they put it. In layman's terms, I'm full of self-deprecating humor, in which I make jokes of myself, whether or not they're grounded in reality or not. Examples would include making jokes about my weight, my self esteem, and my situation in terms of my own self-esteem. I'll admit that their observations have merit; I can make jokes about myself that I would in no way consider making about anyone else that I had any sense of respect for whatsoever. Such is but a fraction of evidence toward a self-diagnoses of a severe lack of self-esteem, which I am fully cognizant of, and through the years, I have even come to accept it, sickeningly enough. My own self-worth (or lack thereof) has become commonplace in my mind, and I have far, far more respect for just about anyone else than I do for myself. Not to go into an overly exampled backstory on this topic, but I haven't exactly been a success, especially when compared to my stepbrother, or even my stepsister, who I am proud to say has gone back to school after three children to try to get a medical degree.

Now, my apathy is certainly one primarily focused on inhibiting my activities. For the most part, however, it serves a subconscious role, and it's only recently that I have been able to even identify this particular attitude in my psyche, let alone be aware of its existence. Prior to said identification, I fully acknowledged that I was simply lazy, or something else was wrong with me that might never have been fixed. This condition, whatever its cause or whatever it subsides on, is slowly killing me, and the scariest part is, it feels like I don't even care if it does. Such a topic has even become routine within my gallows (pardon the pun) humor. 'Dead man walking' jokes aren't uncommon in my repertoire. 

You see, either because, or existing alongside my lack of self-esteem, my apathy toward myself also makes it hard for me to regulate my health. If I don't remind myself to do so, I can go days, if not weeks without brushing. Because I live with family, and work late nights, I can't always take showers when I come home for fear of waking someone up, so I tend to put it off until morning, and by that point, I don't even care to take one. As disgusting as it is, I can oftentimes go for days without bathing, without any conscious effort on my part. Comfort eating is a large part of my problem, as is self-imposed sexual stimulation. The comfort eating, however, is naturally the larger of the two issues if paired up directly. I imagine most people are at least able to recognize in the moment that whatever crap they're putting into their mouths is detrimental to them, but at the time that I'm doing the same, nothing really occurs in my head. In fact, it only tends to be long after the fact that I feel any sort of regret and reprimand myself internally. Nevertheless, this has gone on for years, and it's become a major, immediate issue.

I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes when I was 23. Two years later, it's only gotten worse. I know full well that I can die from this disease, and I also know full well that I can stop it from happening. What is most terrifying to me is that this, even something so critical as this, is something that I can't even bring myself to fix. I am literally killing myself slowly, and all it would take for me to stop would be for me to start eating right.

I just can't care enough to do so for any extended period of time. Sure, every few months I decide that I'm tired of being fat, lonely, and useless, and I decide to go on a diet, but sooner or later, I stop caring. Instead, my mind will turn to escapism, as though it were a television-obsessed homeowner, simply sitting on the sofa as his apartment burns down around him. No attempt is made to call the fire department, and certainly none is made to grab the fire extinguisher. 

I'm an intelligent person. My potential, even when I was young, has been squandered horrendously all of my life. On one hand, I can see fully, completely, what is happening to me. On the other hand, I can only watch, hopeless and listless as every single effort I use to try to change my life falls apart. My mind has decided that the joys of life, real, physical life pale to those of virtual worlds and brainless consumption. And this, exactly, is where the third part of my title comes in;

I am failing as a human being. As a creature, I am failing the trials of evolution. If I continue the way that I am going, I will end up as a genetic dead-end, dying lonely and alone without ever having the chance of being a father. I can fully see this. But even now, my mind shows nary a lean toward the direction of self improvement. It is like a grand tome, with all of the pages having been sundered of their knowledge by the incompetent scribblings of a child with crayons, or a television screen that produces nothing but static. I know I can do better than this, I know I'm SUPPOSED to be doing better than this.

I'm not sure what my answer is. I'm not sure how I pull myself out of this self-imposed hole. Or, rather, I know exactly how, but I'm not sure how to make myself do it. I am broken in some way. Compared to other people, I an a defect, an error. I am a man without a goal, a tool without a purpose. 

Perhaps someone can make sense of this, or even relate to it. In any case, this is a very abridged summary of the primary issue that I have in my life. Someone may enjoy reading and dissecting it, I suppose. I'm not even sure why I wrote this, in hindsight, but I figure there's no real use to delete it now. Go on, comment how you like. You won't offend me. Whatever jeers you can come up with probably pale in comparison to those I've already tailor-made for myself.",10Mar2017,2
25,"Hi I'm new to Reddit, this is my first post. I'm a 20 year old male and have been suffering with Depression, Anxiety and Irrational Obsessive thoughts about myself and others since starting high school (early teens). I started counselling last week in hope that the anxiety and depression will go away. I find it so difficult to engage in conversation with others and build meaningful relationships due to my anxiety and I believe this lack of human interaction is what's fueling my depression. I cannot drink alcohol because the negative thoughts get worse which is unfortunate because a lot of people my age drink when they socialize and go out to busy bars, clubs and pubs. I do feel like I'm missing out.

I've always hoped that with age I would grow out of this anxiety disorder and finally feel comfortable in social situations, enjoy life and feel happy but recently I just can't see a future for myself where I'm happy because I've felt like this for so long. I'm worried that I will feel like this forever and that my life will be spent wishing things were different.

I'm not looking for sympathy. I would like to know if anyone else is experiencing or has experienced anything similar to me and whether they've tried counselling? Is counselling effective at improving one's mental health and does anyone have any success stories where counselling has helped them?

Thanks for your time :)",10Mar2017,1
26,"I'm not well, and I'm so 'not well' that I can't get help. 

Today I found that I don't want to die. It's an improvement, because for a while I've felt comfortable and relaxed with the idea of death; everything ending at once, never having a thought or feeling again, not existing. I was at peace with it, which is not good at all. But today I don't want to die.

I know if I wasn't broken though, that I could do so much better than surviving. I don't do anything, I sit in my room at my dads house and watch TV or sleep and wait to talk to my online boyfriend, because he's the only thing in life that matters to me. I've never had ambition or dreams to chase, I've never had a career I wanted, I don't know how far back being 'broken' goes but I really feel like it's always been there even as a kid. I remember as a kid I'd thought it'd be easiest to just be a prostitute and didn't think past that, it didn't matter. 

I'm so tired. I don't remember the last time I could think with a clear head it's been so long. Every day, foggy and sleepy and scared. Every day on the edge of tears without realizing it or knowing why. Every day struggling to hold onto any feeling I can muster so that I don't fall back into feeling numb. I can't keep track of time well, I have no idea if something happened a few days ago or a few weeks ago or a few months ago. I'm unsure if some things actually happened at all, sometimes I don't know if I'm awake.

I made an online friend somewhat recently, and we bonded and related over being terribly depressed, anxious, and living for our SO. It was so nice, to talk to someone and have them just /get/ it. 

I'm only 22, I've been fighting for years, and I can't get help because I am tired and afraid. I can't make phone calls, I can't go out by myself. I don't really have any friends to come with me.

Sorry to post when you can't help me either, I know that. But it seems like I'm running out of people who want to listen to me talk about my problems, so it'd mean alot to me if you could read and reply. I'm so lonely.",10Mar2017,31
