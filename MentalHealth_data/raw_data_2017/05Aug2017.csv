1,"My sister (22) has diagnosed mental conditions including Bipolar disorder. Recently this has been getting worse, as she has not seen a therapist or a psychologist or psychiatrist in years. I'm going to explain today's situation to ask how I should handle future ones. 

She got mad at me for something , which I don't remember what exactly. In this situation she called me ugly, a cunt, annoying, a pendejo, an idiot, a pussy multiple times and told me no one likes me, everyone likes her more, all of my friends like her more and probably more that I can't remember. I did call her some names ( not starting it, I did it back ) but I can't really call her anything because then she freaks out on me. I'm not allowed to say what she says back to me because she told me the way the relationship works is I respect her and she doesn't respect me. She was throwing things in the sink as I was washing dishes and I told her to stop and then I put my hand up when she threw something so it wouldn't go in and she hit me, not hard though bc she's not abusive but it wasn't a tap either. If I hit her back she HAS to get the last hit in. I didn't want to talk to her afterwards and she then said : we were joking I thought we were joking we were laughing ( she was furious before so it wasn't a joke ) and then said you don't want to help your sister? Tell me what I did wrong I don't know.You know I can't control myself. 

I know she can't but I've tried to help so many times before and always tell her where she goes wrong but continues to do it. About 20 min later she tried to talk to me which I initially refuse and then go to the living room , I sounded unhappy and unwanting to hear it to her I guess so she said something like forget it then walked to her room as she said I'm not gonna see a therapist then or get help and I'm just gonna fucking kill myself. Then slammed the door. I know she had issues with self harm in the past so I don't know how to handle this. What do I do guys she won't see someone because she says she's not ready. ",05Aug2017,2
2,"I will start with providing some background information about myself. When I was around 13-15 I became very depressed and regularly self harmed. I thought about suicide often, and had 2 (unsuccessful, obviously) attempts. I completed both outpatient and inpatient therapy programs, was prescribed medication for anxiety and depression, and saw a psychiatrist and therapist regularly. Shortly after I met my current boyfriend, and after a few years of this routine, I slowly weaned off medication and stopped seeing my doctors. Everything was great! I had many friends, graduated early from high school, had a fun job. At 19 I decided to move out and get an apartment with my boyfriend, and this is when all the problems began. I was immediately faced with separation anxiety from my parents. I've never had my parents genuinely tell me how much they missed me, and it tore me to pieces. My mother has had a binge drinking problem for awhile now, and when it's bad, it's very bad. She can be very dangerous to herself (falling down, etc) and it's hard to be around. I found myself feeling ENORMOUS guilt after moving out, especially when my mom's drinking habits worsened. I felt that my decision had direct effects on how my family began to act. I felt that if I wouldn't have moved out, everything would be different. My younger teenage sister wouldnt have started to rebel and stress out my parents. My mom's drinking wouldn't have increased because she wouldn't have missed me or felt sad. And my dad wouldn't have considered divorcing my mom due to her drinking (he quickly dismissed this idea). Also at this time, I began working an extremely stressful job (call center supervisor) where I was screamed at by customers via phone calls for 11 hours a day. I also was attending college full time. My boyfriend then lost his job, and was dealing with his own motivation issues, so he was unemployed for about 6 months. I was a WRECK. I would start bawling uncontrollably at random. I had constant knots in my stomach. Panic attacks would wake me up at night frequently. I missed a lot of work, and I lost about 10-15 lbs while eating more than I ever have. I started to see my psychiatrist again, who just prescribed me useless pills. You get the idea, it was the worst year of my life. Finally, my boyfriend got a job he enjoyed and that paid well. I quit my shitty job. I graduated college. I had a life changing cosmetic surgery for something I was always insecure about. And FINALLY... Things were looking up!!!

Fast forward to this year. I am 21 now. I moved closer to a big city with my boyfriend (5 years of dating now), I found a job I LOVEEE and my boyfriend recently got hired there as well. My mom is actively working on her drinking. I bought my first car... But. I feel dead inside. I no longer have hobbies or anything that brings me pleasure. My life (the past 4 months) has consisted of going to work from 730-4pm, eating dinner, reading social media on my phone (and feeling jealous of all my friends who party and live carefree) and going to bed. Repeat 5x a week. On weekends I feel lost. I legitimately do not want to do anything. I've missed family parties, birthdays, vacations, all because I simply do not want to go. I don't want to see people. I've gained back the weight I lost the previous year, and feel disgusted with myself. I feel like a robot, who when not in the same routine, malfunctions. I pass the time by sleeping, and honestly look forward to days that I have work, so that I don't have to sit around and do nothing at home. I was recently prescribed Vyvanse for binge eating (which I only take on weekdays), and smoke weed daily. I drink maybe once a week.

The advice I'm looking for is.. How do I get out of this funk?? After the worst times of my life are over and everything is moving in a positive direction, I feel so empty and genuinely depressed. I've felt the urge to harm myself. I'm irritable. I can snap and flip out for no reason. I feel like I'm living my life in third person sometimes. Do I just need to find a hobby? And if I do, how does one even start looking for a hobby? Do I just need to exercise regularly? Is this all in my head???

I'm at a loss. Please provide suggestions. I want to enjoy my life.",05Aug2017,3

4,"So let me clarify, I'm not talking about faking happiness here. This is beyond my control.

I have this ""outer mood"", which is sort of just how I act. And it doesn't match my actual mood a lot of the time. I'll be really upset, and I keep acting bubbly and happy, and I can't control it. Sometimes I even want to appear upset so certain people will know how to interact with me appropriately. i also cry when I'm not particularly upset or anything. Like the other day I started joke/fake crying becuase I'm silly like that, and then it made me really cry??? I also cry at things that aren't really that sad, like stuff on TV. Someone's dog was sick in a TV show and I was really tearing up, but it didn't make me upset. The dog wasn't even sick in a life-threatening way.

Does this happen to any of you? I have bipolar with mixed states, and I can't find this as a symptom. Also lately I keep smelling Mexican food when there is no Mexican food. what is going on????",05Aug2017,1
5,"Hi everyone. After much soul searching in the wake of my latest failed relationship, I realize that I am middle aged and have never addressed my low self esteem. My parents were non-loving, unpredictable, and emotionally abusive. Every relationship I've had has failed, generally, at least in part, due to my insecurity and fear of rejection.

I know that intense therapy is probably the answer, but I support a child in NYC and funds are very limited. 

Is there hope for me? I'm reading CBT and books about attachment therapy. What else can I do? I'm desperate and fighting the inner critic that says I'm too old and should probably get used to being alone and drinking too much. Has anyone had experience overcoming this later in life?",05Aug2017,5

I don't normally dream at night, and I havent had a nightmare since I was about 8, but this really scared me. It was so real, when I woke up I almost started crying, what could this dream mean, has anyone else had a similar dream, I am really scared of myself right now, and I dont think I will be able to go to sleep for a while, thanks in advance.",05Aug2017,2

10,"I am female 23 I have major depression, anxiety and am recovering from bulimia. I tend to dissociate when very sad or stressed. I also take a combination of SSRIs and smoke weed recreationally/to self medicate. 

In my personal relationships i.e. Family and boyfriend I tend to think that I am right in situations of disagreement. I also often don't care about others feelings or care very little when they are upset. I act like I do care but I feel that I don't have much feeling for anyone else or myself. Other times, I can be extremely emotional and have a lot of empathy for others (more than most.) I don't understand these two extremes to my personality as I feel they are simply moods but the outcome of my behavior has had negative effects on my loved ones. I don't wish anyone harm but I often wonder if I can actually love someone truly or if my mental issues block too many emotions to feel it...any thoughts, comments, or personal stories would be greatly appreciated xx",05Aug2017,5

12,"I'm not sure how to even start this, but i'm trying to figure out how to get my brother help. i'm willing to do anything, i just want my brother back, even if that feels selfish to say. i hate seeing him like this, and i hate seeing the toll its taking on my parents.

I'm 29M, married and live with my wife about 5mins away from my brother, who is 20M and living with my parents.

i'll start back 3-4 years ago, he broke his leg/ankle in a pretty bad way playing sports...battled back with rehab and came back only to get kicked off his HS team due to a snap chat of weed on 420 his Sr year of HS (him and some friends also got busted for possession in the process). he's always excelled at sports (and school), could play D1 club easy.
i know he didn't take loosing that after rehabbing very well, and once that was done with he sort of drifted into hanging out with friends and partying a little more but also he was working 40-50 hours a week, while figuring out college plans. 
Then i think at some point during the past year he took acid, he started just starring at people at work, saying weird things, walked out multiple times, to the point where i had to 'suspend him'. he was going to community college, but stopped going, and his behavior has only gotten more odd. violent out bursts, irrational decisions/logic, or saying that he can hear peoples thoughts and read there minds. lately hes been saying my parents are drug dealers and aren't really his real parents and that he doesn't need to eat because hes living through someone else's body. there's a lot more to this, but i'm tired...i just wanted to get this up.

i'm lost, i know my parents have tried to get him to go talk to someone, he refuses because he doesn't want to take meds or be locked up. they dont want to 302? him...if thats what its called. i got the number of a therapist my mother in law had my wife go to when she was younger. her father passed away when she was 14. 
I was thinking of calling him, or hell anyone, to see if they know what i should do. i'll do anything for him...i'm just lost.

Fuck it's hard to explain I just sometimes feel like I need serious help and other times it's like I manipulate myself into thinking this way. Sorry if I don't make sense . ,05Aug2017,3

15,"I hold a lot of resentment for my parents. 

I'm an accidental baby and as soon as I was born my dad just went away for 14 years. He came back as soon as he heard my mother could sue him for child support. She left it to me to actually sue him, but I was fooled by his ""poor me"" act, since all he did was complain about how poor and sick he was. I've since learnt he's actually pretty rich. Back then my mother wouldn't buy food for me, just for her and my brother. We had huge and constant fights about food, because I'd sneak away some, she'd see and she'd get angry. She'd say my brother's dad gives her child support while mine doesn't. I wasn't eating food, I was ""wasting"" food. Every time I hear the word ""waste"" now I get a little sick. 

My dad and I haven't spoken since last year, because he said ""don't ever even ask me how I'm doing, it's just wasting my time because I have nothing to learn from you"".  Not that we ever really talked, it was usually just him waiting for me to finish so he could talk. He likes to listen to himself talk, he's really into spirituality so he thinks he has many deep, insightful things to say, but to me he just sounds like he is constantly reading from a Paolo Coelho book.

My mother has a whole host of issues herself. I already told you about the food thing. She also liked to constantly scream at me all the time. When I was 10 to 14 especially, until I learnt to tune her out, she would do it for hours and hours every day. She'd remember things I did years before and bring them up every single day. She'd do it until well past midnight every day. I remember going to my room at night and turning off the lights and hiding under the blanket and she'd come and sit next to my bed in the dark and continue screaming. I used to pray to God every night for him to help me die in my sleep. I used to get sick every time I heard the entrance door open when she got home. She remembers and she says ""very well, I did very good"". You know why? Because whatever happened, it was my fault. 

This fault thing is another thing with my mother. She can't ever take responsibility for anything. If she breaks a glass it's the fault of whoever put the glass there. If she got angry once and threw a box with my things, breaking it, it's my fault for buying the box. If she forces my stepdad to waste time and money on something that turns out to be a disaster it's his fault because the way she remembers it is that it was actually he who forced her into doing something she didn't want to. The way her brain twists things to avoid the words ""I did this thing..."" is really amazing and it would be interesting if I wasn't in the middle of it. I don't know where she learnt this either, I spent some time studying the people around her, and no one does this. 

Edit: I forgot to mention she's also a hoarder. In the grand scheme of things it's one of the lesser issues she has. I also remembered how, when I was in school, she would always take my allowance ($5) from me saying she needs it, despite the fact that she didn't need child support from my dad. 

So I sometimes think about these things and I get angry. Recently I met a  friend of my mother's and she told me I should tell her I forgive her and I love her and then she'll feel better. This friend bought my mom's victim ""everybody around me does things to harm me"" thing hook, line and sinker. She has no idea about the things I just told you, although she knows I struggled with depression for a very long time. 

When she told me these things, and that I shouldn't abandon my mother, I felt all these feelings that I cannot even name. Mostly because I feel too ashamed to talk about my experiences while these people have no issues with asking for sympathy left and right and even lying to get it, going through life with no consequences, having people help them and empathizing with them. 

I finally got help for my depression a few years ago when I was really close to suiciding, and neither cared and neither offered to help. My father just silently went away when my mental anguish became very apparent and he came back when I was better, but still brought nothing good with him. 

Now I want to get over this. I am so over thinking about these people. They do not deserve me spending time to think about them, or me spending my emotional energy on them. So I do want to forgive them I guess. And then be indifferent to them. Maybe have the strength to help my mother someday in the future, since she is definitely struggling with some serious things. 

Some days I even forget they exist. Other days I do feel like I forgave them and am past everything. But other days, like today, I feel very resentful. Especially because I never even got the chance to express all these things to them, and I know that if I did they'd find a way to turn it around on me anyway. 

If you've read all this, thank you.

19,"Sorry for the grammar mistakes, english is not my first language, it'll feel like a mini-rant at this point and I need to gain some perspective on the issue and possibly some advices.

I am 26 years old, I've grown up in a small town and after dropping out of university after 2 years I've worked on and off as a manager and teamleader of a small cultural exchange agency for the eu. Nothing fancy, but it's what I love doing, even if means staying at home for months at a time, sometimes even more, the small town where I'm in doesn't offer any kind of part time jobs or anything like that. I feel kinda stuck.

Now a little personal history:
I've lost my father when I was ten after two long years of battle with cancer, and I've seen my father wear down day by day and I basically grew up without any kind of male figure in my life.
My mother has always been a very controlling figure at home, very manipulative, she always had something to say about how I talk to others, how I move, how I  dress, what I do. I remember she also victimized herself, spending hours on end watching melancholic tv series and telling me she enjoyed them because she ""has no life"".
When I was 11, out of grief I think, we joined a new religion and, after some time, when I realized I don't believe in any kind of spiritual figure, she freaked out about it, in a very theatrical manner, and from that day I shut down myself, I started having stress, extremely low self esteem and being very unconfident overall about lots of things. She also dropped off that church a few years later.

Anything I had to say was childish, when some distant family member came home visiting us she was always dismissive of me, talking over me, turning her back on me.
But.
She always claimed to love me and care about me, she cooks nice things and almost shield me from responsabilities and things about the household, she's extremely protective and this for me is the worse, because it completely removes my perception of the line where I might commit some mistakes, and where her emotional manipulation starts.
It's a nightmare, and I always have to filter myself or think twice about doing, literally, everything because she might have something to say about it. We're talking big and small things, she freaks out and becomes aggressive even if I open a window in a room because she's terrified of heat waves, just as a small example.

She also has periods of time where she shuts herself down and runs crying in her room, out of nothing, and periods where she acts overly submissive and respectful over the people she has around, including me. It's like a switch sometimes, and it has always driven me insane. Just yesterday I was looking for something in the drawer and I casually but gently pushed her aside because she was in my way, she bursts and said out of nowhere ""What are these manners?! You hurt me"". A few years back I would have come home with 2 beers for a big match on streaming in the evening and she hid them from me stating ""No, I don't want to see you drunk"". And then when I freaked out about her behavior she went ""What you're going to do then? You're going to hurt me?"".

If we start to talk about this she starts telling me ""You should have lived with your father and not me"" and victimize herself in a very, i don't know, socially weird manner, almost theatrical, every single time. Something that she shows only to me, she's overly sugary and positive with everybody else.

And now about me, this weights on me quite a lot.
Because I am a good person, I have a good respectful relationship with people, I have few but good friends, hobbies and passions and it was hard as nails for me to forge my personality not having absolutely any role model to follow, no idea of how to act around people as a man and, for some little things, I still struggle to learn these things.

The point is that I tend to shut down and isolate myself quite a lot, I'm not depressed or anything, but I can go on for months and shut myself in my room, meditating, watching netflix, reading, exercising and working from my pc, without going out or talking to anybody.
I almost find comfort in this, and I tend to take distances from the world because I don't feel like I can manage any kind of relationships when I'm here, I feel like I'm 1/4 as worth as when I'm traveling, or working outside of my country. The problem is that those experiences are very few and far in between and it's incredibly hard to find any kind of part time job in here, if not downright impossible. Sometimes I feel like I'm suffocating, but most of the time I just feel asleep and feel nothing at all. And I live in this neutral state, shutting my emotions from my mother and my grandmother (She's very old and she started living with us a few years back).

I can go on but I think I'll end it here, it's a wot, but somewhat helped me gaining some insight about what I'm facing in this period.

I guess I could just go somewhere else, but I have absolutely no idea how to move by myself.
All these options feel a little bit out of my reach and overall too distant. Besides it almost feels like I'm running away from something and carrying all her problems with me. I don't know.

I know I am a lot to deal with and he's had to deal with an awful lot. I know it got really bad. Like his friends would say I was using my mental health to abuse him. And so he started to fixate on the idea that I DO abuse him. But it's not intentional. I lash out when I'm having anxiety attacks. And I'm working on it. We had been doing so damn good and then I had to go out drinking. I still don't know what was said or what I did. I just woke up in the hospital in a safe room and know my stomach was pumped.

22,"Hey team -

TL;DR - childhood neglect and abuse have turned me into a cold, mean, apathetic, angry (but somewhat successful) human, and though you'd not likely know it as an outside observer, it's hurting a lot and getting in the way of my life and family. Want to know what type of therapy options there are so I can search and find accordingly. 

I don't know much about therapy, but was listening to a Tim Ferriss podcast recently where the guest was talking about a type of therapy that was like ""abuse therapy"" or something, and specifically dealt with the neurological/neurotransmitter side of things. 

Her ""symptoms"" resonated with me and it intrigued me enough to look into it, but I'm not really sure what the options are or what the right words are to Google, even. 

Would appreciate any of your experiences and feedback to get me on the right path, thank you. 

Parents divorced due to adultery at age 3, never lived in one house/city or went to the same school for more than 2 years, mother has been mentally ill for as long as I can remember, going through a near fatal battle with anorexia for years. 

Have always felt like the parent to my parents, anger/rage is my most common emotion, I've numbed many other feelings which has made me insensitive and apathetic, even to my wife and children to a large degree. 

I'm an entrepreneur, have insanely high expectations for myself which I then put on others who are close to me, beat myself up about failure quite a lot. 

I meditate daily and have for nearly a year, which has taken me from absolute shit show to being a much more calm and mindful human being. I workout or play sports 6 days per week, eat well, and recently remembered I love playing hockey (such a surprise to actually feel positively about something!). 

Self care wise I am very dialled in, but i know I'm insanely hamstrung by my emotionally abusive/neglected childhood. I see the patterns and the causes of my behaviours, but need help changing them, as it's alienating my family and basically I spend too much time being unproductive focusing on what a loser I am. 

Have inherent distrust that the ""therapy"" route actually works, but this podcast gave me hope that there is a form of help that may be useful.

I have Medicaid, but I'm waiting for a replacement card because I lost my card. I have my Medicaid account number. 

I feel like my best option is to go to the hospital because how much worse can it get? I have shockingly bad anxiety and because of this I've been unable to make any decisions to change or better my life. I don't know how to describe it. I just literally can't make a decision because my anxiety tells me that just leads to 10 more decisions that have to be made. 

I'm at a loss. I don't necessarily want to die, but I can't deal with the pain and nothingness for much longer. I fantasize about just not waking up in the morning. I can't sleep unless I'm incredibly self medicated. 

The saddest part of this is I feel like besides medication and treatment for my substance abuse, there will be people for me to talk to if I go to the hospital. 

Also, will I get treatment for substance abuses? The only thing really keeping me from going at this point is being trapped there in withdrawals with no options. I have no experience with any of this except I know someone who was admitted for manic depressive disorder a while back and their advice was not to go because it was terrible. Although I don't know if that's because he was very resistant to treatment or not. 

So, that's where I'm at. Every minute of my day is painful, and while I know I'm not alone in that, it doesn't make me feel any better.


Edit: A couple of weeks ago I had an episode where I completely blanked out. 3-5 hours of a day are missing from my memory. I had a drink before this, but o was no where near drunk/stoned/anything like that. I have NEVER experienced anything like that unless I was very drunk, and even then I had pieces of memory. This is like my mind was wiped while I was having a severe panic attack/meltdown.",05Aug2017,1

39,"I don't know why I'm writing this post. I don't even know why I care. There's absolutely no point to anything anymore.

Some backstory:
I'm from Canada and I've had Bipolar II my entire life and a year ago was diagnosed with BPD as well. I am also in recovery for bulimia but my relapse-prevention therapy sessions are over now. For as long as I can remember, I've cycled through depression 2-3 times a year. Right now my life is in shambles. Everything is just falling apart and I have no control over it anymore and I'm tired. This is the worst depression I've ever gone through.

I'm tired of being miserable so much. I'm tired of constantly having to fight this. I'm tired of every moment of happiness being fleeting. I'm tired of ruining my life and I'm tired of ruining everyone else's life. Most of all though, I'm tired of my emotions and pain. I'm either numb or hysterical, and it's unpredictable. Getting to work early to open the store and crying for an hour until my shift starts for example. I just want it to be over. I don't want to try anymore.

I've already created a plan. I am going to give my therapy a chance this coming Tuesday but I'm doubtful it will help. I don't even want to tell them what's going on because there's a risk of forcibly being admitted to the psychiatric ward and last time I was there, it was hell. I have already written my note, I've saved enough money to order a helium tank. I want to do it by the end of the month. 

Again, I don't know why I'm writing this. Maybe I do have some hope that things will get better but as usual in every scenario, every time I'm positive, things just get worse. So why look at the world with rose-coloured glasses when I can look at it through real ones?",05Aug2017,1

41,"I recently reminded of the unhappy experiences with my housemate. I shared a house with two girls more than a year ago. It was the 1st time I shared a house with others. And one of them suggested that we share all the foods and pay equally(now I know it was a bad idea). Then there came the conflicts, they sometimes invited many friends to have a meal with us, without asking me. I didn't want to appear stingy so I didn't say. I only stayed there for 4 months. Ｗhen I was leaving I thought I had right to take some shared stuff. But I didn't do that as I worried the dispute. Like they would complain they can't use if I took something. Yes, one of the girls was stingy in my view.

I didn't take it very seriously for that moment. Also, I didn't think of that time for quite a while. But now I suddenly reminded myself of that. I think I suffered losses. I feel I was abused. I was too shy, or maybe too stupid to express my idea. Now I keep thinking about it. I keep rebuilding the situation in m mind and thinking what I should have done. Like I am living in the past, not the present. How should I deal with my situation?

PS: I tried to talk about my concerns with that girl but she just deleted me from her contacts.",05Aug2017,1

I had recently had a hard break-up with my girlfriend of 10 months, but even before the break-up, I'd been doing some hard self-analysis. I'm going to go see a therapist/psychologist/somebody ASAP, but I'm at a loss for what I'm actually needing help for.

For a bit, I thought that I was struggling with psychopathy, due to ""ticking most of the boxes"". However, it seems that a big part of psycopathy is a lack of remorse. I know that I'm a bag of shit, and I hate it, so that part doesn't seem to add up. The other thing to add to the mix is frequent Homicidal Ideation, which also doesn't seem to add up anywhere on the chart. Also, keep in mind that I'm officially diagnosed with major depressive disorder, and am currently on meds for that.

So basically, should I still go to the therapist person under the pretense that I think I might be a psycopath, or is there something else?",05Aug2017,3
