0,"I recently moved to Tennessee from Arkansas. I had medicaid in Arkansas, but just found out Tennessee doesn't give medicaid for low income. You have to have a disability or something to qualify. My disorders prevent me from working too much, so I don't make a lot of money. I've gone through the healthcare marketplace and the cheapest plan was $340. I'm now without medication and can't go to a doctor because they won't accept me without insurance. How do people with low income see doctors and get medication? I'm almost at a point to go to the emergency room for suicidal thoughts just to get some kind of medical attention. I wouldn't be able to pay the bill, but my credit's already screwed anyway. Any suggestions? ",07Dec2017,1
1,"Hey guys,

I feel like you emotionally intelligent people will understand where I'm coming from with this. 

I'm F19 and have recently started college. I have a handful of extremely good friends from my home city who know me inside out. I'm quite introverted and awkward, but fun and into partying with the rare people i vibe with. I think I became so close with my home friends bc we've all known each other for years and shared so many formative experiences. Life doesn't really get in the way when you're 14/15/16 - we all saw each other weekly and started experimenting with alcohol together/just grew up together. Everything feels so right with them, and they make me feel like a sparkling, energetic, compassionate person who is *easy to love*.

Skip to college, where I feel like I'm hard to like/love. Before starting, I told myself ""I cant be looking for people like my old friends .. college will be colder and more adult by nature"". I consider myself pretty aware and predicted that, whilst you CAN start from scratch and be *anyone* in college, this doesn't necessarily correlate with it being easy to find people you can become close friends (being someone who'd rather be alone than be with someone unmatched to me). ALL I hoped for was to find one or two gems, the kind of friends who you connect with like *mad* initially and who then feel like siblings after a year.

I'm 3 months into college, and I have one early-stage-but-decent friendship with a girl i live with. She is lovely, but being with her isn't energising because she isn't a deep thinker or someone i can *truly* click with. Apart from her, i **only** have acquaintances who seem to semi-like me but aren't fussed about getting to know me better. Also, despite me being polite to everyone and so interested in people in general (asking questions etc.), SO MANY people don't seem to warm to me. 

I'm not being paranoid - this doesn't particularly upset me, as i know deep down that *they* only seem to be doing better than me socially because they're less emotionally astute and only really crave friends to go clubbing with and (in the case of other girls) take pics with/compliment each other. I'm craving someone to talk to at 4am about feelings/life/philosophy, and these people aren't like me. Their idea of friendship is fairly shallow. I don't want to seem judgmental as I truly am not - just being honest. The point isn't that I pedestal these uni people and am gutted I can't be their friend, it's that I'm disillusioned by how hard it is for someone like me to find likeminded people.

I do love partying, but not with people i don't particularly know or like. It leaves me feeling so empty and borderline depressed. I still go on nights out and socialise 24/7 really, but I'm not really ""present"". One night with my friends from home feels like a fulfilling, mini documentary where I'm totally myself, yet allllll my uni nights out merge into a mess of drunken, draining boredom, because I don't have (truly have) anyone.

Whilst I could get through these 3 years focusing on work and having acquaintances, I KNOW that i am capable of forming insanely complex, close platonic relationships. 

I know that everything takes time and i may seem silly complaining after 1 semester of uni, but I am good at predicting social outcomes and know that 1. 95% of the people I'm meeting at uni are so different to me that a friendship with them would be the opposite of mentally stimulating, and 2. even though soft, spiritual and curious people like me ARE out there, uni is so mature and distant in many ways that I just *won't* get to know them enough to *discover* that they're like me.

Everyone seems so generic to me, and I blame uni - my classes and modules are constantly switching, I'm in lectures with 600 others and I don't click with my small-class group.

**tl;dr**: coming to terms with the fact that this stage of my life is going to be full of debauchery, sure, but that I'm unlikely to find people who love, and are enthralled by, other people in the way that I do/am. I don't want to take pics and talk about cooking with friends, i want to know them inside out and be in their lives forever.

**Anyone relate?** Is this just the reality of adult life, and the reason why people crave romantic intimacy? Do the crazy, sibling-like friendships only happen as a result of growing up together/sharing crazy times?",07Dec2017,20

I’ve always prioritized my mental health over my physical health, but I’m having heart episodes.  What’s more important happiness with a chance of early death, or a prolonged but miserable life.  This priority has also nuked my kidneys, but I can deal with that with yet more medication.

I’ve tried just about every med, and landed on my current ones by trial and error.  They are all important.  I have schizoaffective disorder and previous eating disorders.",07Dec2017,3
8,"Scenario: (I'm at my parents house)

1. The phone rings, and my mom asks me to get it.

2. I scramble toward the phone, but the answering machine starts before I can get there.

3. My mom's brother starts leaving a message, so I pick it up and say ""hello"". No one responds, so I think ""hmm"" and hand the phone to my mom, whom he's presumably calling to speak with.

4. My mom starts talking to him and I hear, ""yeah, Riverwood grabbed it and handed it to me"".

5. I revere my uncle, and say ""shhhhhh"" to my mom, because I don't want her telling him I handed the phone off.

6. Upon seeing my ""shhhh"" gesture, she immediately, and in a sort of amused way, tells him ""oh, now Riverwood is telling me to shutup"".   

So now I *really* feel like an asshole, as if handing off the phone because of my social anxiety didn't make me feel shitty enough to begin with. 

I am a grown man now, but this exact thing has happened throughout my life. I overhear her saying things on the phone about me, that I don't want them to know-- then I say ""shhhhh"" or simply get mad, which leads her *always* to tell the person on the phone ""ohhh.... now he is reallly mad."" And then I hear her say that, and get even more mad, and she then says ""oh boy now he is realllly, realllllly mad.""


Maybe I'm just an oversensitive asshole... but it's such a helpless feeling. And it's happened probably 20+ times throughout my life--- usually stemming from her telling the person something I don't want them to know. 

What are your thoughts? Would you find that frustrating or do I have anger issues?

10,"I have social anxiety and it's messed up every area of my life. I've never been to a party, never been in a relationship, never had many friends, never went out to a club or a bar, never gotten drunk or high, never had a job more than 3 months. My life is just a long list of things I've never accomplished or experienced because my fear was always stopping me. 

I just feel ashamed of myself for not having done these things like any other functional adult. It makes me feel inferior to people. There's no one in my life who quite understands what I'm going through. When I think about the future, I get a bad feeling in my gut that things are not going to end well. I think my life will probably end by my own hands. ",07Dec2017,8
11,"I've been depressed most my life, 30 years old now. However in the last year ive started feeling extreme pain in my hips/butt all the way down behind my knees.
  
An mri showed I had a bulging disk, so I've done physical therapy, steroid shots, medications, so far nothing's working and 2 surgeons have told me im not a good candidate.
  
So someone suggested, the pain might be psychosomatic. Not that I don't have pain, but that my depression might be amplifying it to this unbearable level.
  
Has anyone experienced anything like this before? I'm going to talk to my therapist about it asap, but... It seems like... I'm in a LOT of pain, ya know? Could it really be my mind? That's why I'm asking if anyone else has felt this before. So maybe I can feel a little less crazy
  
Thanks!",07Dec2017,8
13,"I’ll let it be known I have a bad habit of self diagnosing.  I have an appointment for Friday and my minds been definitely grabbing at straws.  Nothings felt **right**.  Depression fits, but I randomly get happy.  Maybe it’s normal for some people.  Bipolar would take that, and fits my mood swings, but they’re too often or too short, and maybe a bit too many mixed symptoms.

And then I went to r/BPDLovedOnes because I wanted to learn more on my sister with BPD.  BPD was at the back of my mind on me only because of my mood swings and my sister.  I’ve looked at the symptoms and I didn’t see it.  There was a thread from however long ago about he symptoms manifested for their loved ones.  It sounded a lot like me and how I thought and felt.  Looked up the symptoms in DSM with what I read on the subreddit, and I can completely see it.  I have enough for a diagnosis even as long as everything matches up and the only thing it’s missed are things due to the abuse (memories, nightmares) which occasionally come with my depressive episodes and ADHD-like symptoms which my sister has.  She was diagnosed with ADHD and they “removed” that diagnosis when she was diagnosed with BPD.

It makes me feel a little less anxious, but also more.  I’m so anxious about telling my parents, they don’t even know I’ve been struggling because I was more or less taught through punishments not to ever show symptoms.  I got caught with self harm and the way that it was dealt with was by threatening to take me to a psychiatric hospital (which they went in depth how awful it is).

I was always sheltered.  I was with my dad when she told him and he really didn’t say anything.  I got a whole lot of nothing after that.  I don’t know if my sister will go off on me or handle it well if I’m diagnosed with it, and I don’t know how my parents will react.  With depression or bipolar I was expecting a lot of drama, but I wasn’t seriously expecting this.

I’ll tell her we should start a club though.

Best part is there’s no true 100% cure.  Awesome.  Neat.  Hopefully it’s not that.",07Dec2017,2
16,"So im staying with my mom and when she talks shes very negative very psychologically abusive. I cant say anything without her chiming in telling me the 100 reasons why i did it wrong or 1000 things i could have done better. She also tries to manipulate me into being late for stuff, weird i know.

Anyways i would consider myself fairly attractive and girls hit on me more often then not. I try to stay out of my moms house as much as i can for my mental healths sake, but shes been rubbing off on me. 

Example: i tried to take my son to an indoor playground because it was raining. They close at 8 we were leaving at 6. As we're leaving out the door, my mom is ranting and raving about how i HAVE to feed my son before we go and blah blah blah. Then insists on buying us taco bell. Then forcefully insists on going to taco bell together. Then forcefully insisting on eatting inside. Then taking an hour to eat, but she doesnt want to go with us to the playground. Finally take her home shortly before they close. All while erroding my self-esteem abt how my hair is ugly i cant drive well. Im going to the wrong taco bell my music is too loud. Etc etc.etc

So me and my son went to the mall instead. This pretty russian girl was hitting on me, she was persistant too. I was very standoffish and negative thoughts were spewing out of me like  She doesnt like me. Theres no way we could connect, shes russian im not. She proly thinks im weird ugly etc. It's innapropriate to flirt in front of my son (single dad) what is he thinking? Very irrational logic

18,"So, I’ve been trying to get my mother to, take me to a doctor, which they have, but I feel like they’re avoiding my problems on purpose? Every time I bring up, how I’d like to see a professional, they shrug it off. For a while they were going to get me medication, and they say that it’s just hard at this time in life. 

I’m not debating that it is, hard. People are getting into relationships, which I have no interest in, and it’s hard for me to make friends, it always has been, and I got bullied in 4th. I’m gullible, so if a girl says that putting toothpaste on cuts is a good idea, I’d follow that religiously. Thankfully, I have semi-good relationships now. I’m confused (I had a ‘coming to jesus’ moment and told everyone I was a lesbian within a month on impulse oops) about my sexuality, as most are, and have no interest in dating, but I have a few, good friends, which is something I’ve never said before. 

Ever since I was, about eight? I’ve seen doctors about possible ADHD. It is in the family, bipolar, ADHD, anxiety, and heavy substance abuse. But when doctors brought up possibly testing me further, my parents refused, and rather told them they’d take care of it themselves. I didn’t even learn this until they got drunk and spilled it. They get very frustrated and angry, making me make lists, telling me to “be in the now,” and even telling me they’d enlist me, since the army “builds character.”

When I was little, I no doubt had trouble focusing, would bounce off the walls, and made impulsive decisions. This is common for a kid, I think, but it was concerning to the point my teachers got involved and asked my parents to seek a professional. In sixth grade, I was failing almost every class, couldn’t keep my mouth shut, I fidgeted, and the problem persisted. 

In seventh, however, my parents sought out a doctor to test me for depression, since I had been lashing out more, crying, and overall was very tired.  I wouldn’t leave the house without something covering my body, I couldn’t walk past people or stand up after class without my heartbeat quickening, sweating, etc. I lied on the test, saying I didn’t have suicidal thoughts, because I did, somewhat, even if it wasn’t grounded in reality. They did try, not very well, but their intentions were good. Trying to sign me up for exercise classes only made my anxiety much worse, because it was exclusively track stars there, and I’m about 45 pounds overweight (I eat compulsively, which I didn’t realize until my doctor explained it). Even trying meditation, but mindfulness only stood to make me feel weird, and I considered it useless. 

I did see a doctor, my mom had found me crying in my closet (my knee seems to give out and pop out of place every once every 5 months or so, it hurts, and they laugh when I bring it up), and she promised to take me to see a doctor. The biggest thing that annoys me out of this, is that they don’t believe me. They ask constantly if the reason I’m not bothering to put on makeup in the morning or put much effort into my hair is because I’m being bullied, or in a fight with a friend, and are skeptical when I tell them the real problem is that I’m just too exhausted with doing anything but laying in bed for hours in the dark.

I’ve had anxiety attacks. Of course my friends say they’ve had them, but once, one of them called during a (panic?) attack and tried to calm me down, said it’s the worst he’s ever seen. They confuse sobbing with panic. Everything becomes bright, the edge of my vision fades black, and all I can think is, “I’m going to die, I’m going to dieI’mgoingtodie”. I rock back and forth, muttering things repetitively like, “I’m not okay, not normal, not okay,” and try to control my breathing. I haven’t had one in months, excluding the bathroom of my middle school boyfriend’s funeral (a suicide) in October. 

I do have trouble focusing. If someone is talking to me, and I see a brightly colored broom, or someone walking by, I completely cannot hear what the person just said. It’s hard to read books, because too many words together makes my head hurt and they seem to blend together. I’m afraid of being called on, or of speaking and my voice coming out shaky, and about a million different other things. I no longer bounce off the walls, but my brain does connect random bits of information to connect one thought to the other. I’m very tired, throughout the day, and get very irritated and angry and little things that shouldn’t make me feel that way. (I was going to say more but I forgot as soon as I began to type, but ig that’s a good example, right?). 

Very sorry for such a long post, thank you for reading, means a lot.

I have this compulsion to pick and pull at my eyebrows. I can usually control myself in public, but the feeling to do it is still there. And sometimes I catch myself doing it &amp; I try to stop, but I just end up doing it again. 

I'll like pull at the hairs and pull them out. I hate it because if I do it too much I thin out my eyebrows or leave weird spots. This is super embarrassing. But I need answers. Why am I doing this and is anyone else going through the same thing?

21,"So I know I have MDD, since I was diagnosed a few months back. But recently I've strated to realize that there's probably something else wrong with me? Maybe I'm just a stupid person who has the emotional stability/intellegence of a 6 year old, but please hear me out. 

So obviously whenever my energy gets low, the depression kicks in, but whenever my energy gets higher (which automically happens whenerver I'm in a social setting because extraversion) I get in this ""state"". Basically how it is is that if depression is feeling everything at a 1 and ""normal"" is feeling things at a 5, then this state is feeling everything at an 11. Every emotion is just on full throttle. Happiness is euphoria, fear is anxiety, irritation is rage, etc. Even as self-aware as I tend to be (I always can tell exactly when I'm having a depressive episode), when I'm in this state, I'm almost completely unself-aware. It's like socializing gives me energy and I get drunk of that energy or something. I don't know. It kind of fucks me up when I'm at work, since I spend so much time interacting with people. Does that make sense?

I'll try to get an official diagnosis soon, but until I can get some other health bills paid off, all I can do is just talk about and think about these things on my own. What does this sound like to you guys?",07Dec2017,1

29,"Hi,

so it seems like either I push through or believe my mind which flipped over 4 months ago. 
I seriously feel like since this has started that Ive been destined to suicide.

So my mind is so unbelievably destructive and I am severely depressed, no that I dont want to do anything, rather cant imagine doing anything with these thoughts, more like intrusive feelings based on false beliefs.

Basically I recovered from DPDR this year, everything is as it used to be except for my mind. It is so worn out because the 6 months of DP were too much I guess. It is so worn out that I could convince myself that I died when DP hit me in February. There is nothing worse than no symptoms but still irrational thinking. It recently hit me with massive bouts of hopelessness and suicidal thoughts. It feels like I shouldnt be here anymore. 

4 months ago I thought suicide was an absurd thing (for me) and even during DP suicide didnt even cross my mind one single time. But now it feels like my worst imaginations came true and it is just pure mental pain. 

Everything about future is triggering the hell out of me, I cant picture myself in the future anymore without thinking (maybe I might have killed myself by then?!), it is so difficult to even hold the place at university, but Ive already decided that I'd drop out. 

It all changed in July where I had ups and downs but in the beginning of August these intrusive bouts of suicidal thoughts (like I hit a threshold and the only way out would be suicide, because it felt so terribly painful, like I was destined to suicide) hit me out of the blue and I suddenly became paranoid of time and future... It is not that I dont want to live anymore but my mind doesnt. It is strange...:( Most strange thing: IT FEELS LIKE I SHOULD HAVE DIED, SOME DARK FEELING WHICH EATS ME AND THAT I'D BE DESTINED TO SUICIDE! I have a really bad urge to feed in to these feelings even though I know Id made it worse...

Ive always been lazy and kind of stubborn, but I get things done, like school requirements. Ive been suffering from depression since I was 13, and I believe from other illnesses as well. I was not diagnosed by a professional because of the mental health stigma in my country (third world) and my family is close-minded and uneducated about mental illnesses. I tried to open up yrs ago but they shut me down, saying I'm ungrateful and selfish. Despite the lack of professional diagnosis, it's obvious to me that something's wrong.

I only wanna live in my head. I dont wanna go out. I hate everyone and everything around me. But im aware im the problem. This is the point in my life where im laziest.

I know other depressed people can still function. So am i before. Am i making my mental illness as an excuse to procrastinate, and this is not that worse? How do i get into action again?

33,"Hey reddit i am been thinking of going to therapy since 7 years as i have child hood trauma and real emotional baggage which is causing me my relationship,job and other parts of my life. What made me take this decision to start therapy was a recent breakup where i was desperate clingy and other  things which was a recepie for disaster. So i searched a good therapist online and found this therapist who had 17 years of experience in the field and worked for a huge clinic. Fast forward, I sat there telling him all about my childhood in a 20 min session.I already was getting a bad vibe from him. He goes on to tell me ""Whats  happened in the past is the past now,Move on"". Never adressed any of my traumatic moments. Instead his solution was for me to look at all bright things that  happened. It wasnt all dark. I know it wasnt!!!. But the fucking darkness has fucked me up and if i dont address it how am i going to move on.(Sorry for the rage).I have  self esteem issues now due to that. He says find a role model like mahatma gandhi and you will get your confidence back. I wanted to flip the table when i heard that. I am not saying i didnt have moments in my childhood which great. I did. And i am glad. But the rough childhood has screwed me up in a way and i know that. I dont know what to do now. I live with my parents. I am a 22 year old man. I cant even run away from this.  I will move out after a few months to pursue my masters but until them i am stuck here

35,"I cannot rave about this show enough. Not only is it fucking hysterical, but also it addresses the topic of mental health and ""crazy"" in a wonderful way. I find the main character, Rebecca, painfully relatable. She's regarded as quirky and bizarre, but cute and fun, but internally she's a trainwreck. They address her taking medication and being institutionalized very early on in the show as well. The show even addresses the stigma behind mental illness.  
  
I'm on season 3 now, **(don't read this if you don't want spoilers)**.  
  
She attempts suicide by overdosing and she says something incredibly moving and sadly relatable, ""I didn’t even wanna die, I just wanted the pain to stop. It was just like I ran out of stories to tell myself that it would be okay.” I found this so fucking relatable and it touched me to see it on television getting exposure.

36,"So basically I have 4 mental disorders, and one effects what I wear so it makes it hard for me to get a job (which makes me feel worse) 
So I was told about this company near me and they are so desperate for people that they will take anyone, a friend of a friend works for them and says it's awesome, light work but good pay and what not. 

I was given a number to call and I can't bring myself to call. I really need this job but every time I do I hang up or tremble or can't even press the dial button. I don't even know what to say to them and I tried writing down a phone script but I just couldn't.

40,"So, given that yet again professional help's dimmest hope is gone once more for me, I decided that enough is enough, so I'll be self-medicating. 

I first checked the often mentioned Xanax, but when I looked in to the side effects, one simple question was concieved in my mind: ""HOW CAN ANY MOTHERF@@@ER EVEN ALLOW THIS SH@T TO BE IN THE MARKETS OH MY GOD?????!!!! THIS EITHER MAKES YOU ADDICTED OR JUST DRIVES YOU TO SUICIDE WHAT IN THE F@CKING F@CK????!!!!""

Since then, my desperation outgrew my carefulness, though not to a limit of recklessness. I know it can cause addiction (which the user manual tries to silver line by calling it dependency) so I'm extra wary of it still. How much time does it take until the addiciton kicks in? I only need it to kick me through the last week of the semester, after that I'm not taking it again. How common are the side effect? one in ten people? One in a hundred?

If it has physiological side effect, like diarrhea or some stuff, i don't care, at this point if someone told me dried dog shit can make me feel better when smoked, I'd be carving a pipe right now.",07Dec2017,3
41,"These last few weeks, I've felt nothing but my pain. Long story short, I watched my older brother - the person I admired the most in this world - slowly die from brain cancer. 15 months of highs and lows, ultimately until the last two months when he finally took a turn for the worse. He died in January of this year.

I watched him die. I couldn't leave his side, until the end. I literally watched my brother die. Ever since, I haven't been right. I feel like a piece of me died with him that morning. And I will never forget the face my mother made when she heard, or the sounds her and my sister made. 

It's like a never ending loop, forever playing in slow motion in my head. It's caused me to have severe depression and less severe anxiety. It caused me and my girlfriend to split up. A few months ago, I met a new girl, we hit it off well. However, my anxiety and depression ultimately caused me to come off as clingy and annoying, and she ultimately decided she couldn't be with me either. 

I can't live my life because of my illness. Why bother even being alive, then? I don't find enjoyment in things I used to love doing. I don't find comfort in a sunset. I'd rather just be dead. But I don't have the stones to end it. But I just wish I wouldn't wake up, or a semi crashes into me while I'm driving. I think it's because I want to take my brother's place. He had a wife and a daughter, I have nothing to show for anything. He had everything to live for. I got nothing. ",07Dec2017,2
42,"I was gonna write some long winded post explaining everything but i think i'll just cut to the chase. Over the last little while i've been having this growing feeling of not wanting to really do anything. I just feel tired and unmotivated and i have this sort of dull bordness hanging over me.

If i was to guess what's causing it i'd say it might be the weather as its getting colder and darker for longer here in the UK, it might be my insecurities; ive never a relationship, can't pass my driving test, struggling to make new friends at Uni, don't have anyone to move into a flat with. Im envious of my flatmates with lots of close friends and big families which is something ive never had.

On top of this my friends from home have made little to no effort in contacting me, i try to ask how they are doing and keep in touch but i've been here since September and not one of them has got in touch with me first. It's just getting me down.

The part about not having a relationship can get to me quite a bit too. As an 18 year old male, there is a sense of embarassment over admitting that you've never had sex, had a relationship, never had a fist kiss, hell i've barely had a hug. It makes me feel like Im just not worth anyone's time.

**TL; DR** I sometimes gets these thoughts like it's never gonna happen, i'm gonna be stuck alone and friendless for the rest of my days. I feel like an insignificant background character in someone else's life, like i don't have a purpose. When i have these thoughts i don't want to go out and do things, i want to stay in bed alone and pity myself, which isn't helping my situation at all.

I don't want to go seeking help because having lived with people who have genuine mental health issues, i feel like i'm just sitting here feeling sorry for myself and i don't want to take up that could be used to help someone with real 
Problems or discredit actual issues.

It's not hugely debilatating, i still have good days, I just want to try and find a way to get out of this grey funk im in right now.

44,"I used to think that persistent emotional states were prolonged experiences of the common named feelings, like sad or happy. Like, a bad mood would be feeling sad for some length of time.

Actually though, feelings seem to almost always exist in connection with patterns of behaviour. I include the way you focus on the present moment and thoughts as part of behaviour here. This pattern can become self-sustaining and very persistent, but still, if it's somehow interrupted I can end up in a very different state quickly. So, it doesn't really seem persistent on its own.

For a long time I've known of another phenomenon which I called ""energy"". It can be less obvious than the named emotions. Mainly I notice that when I have more energy there are more elements of enjoyment in my perception and I have more motivation. Having more energy allows me to enjoy more objectively neutral things, essentially serving as a positive bias. It causes the difference between tending to just worry about problems and having motivation to do something useful about problems.

Mainly I'm surprised by how I can't put labels on this or directly feel it. Maybe I can use the label ""mood"" for what I used to think of as ""energy"" though.",07Dec2017,3
45,"Hello Reddit,

I don’t really post much on reddit and honestly I need some advice. So a little background info. I started a new position within UPS in their finance department and thought it’d be a good job where I wouldn’t have to talk to many people. But what they didn’t tell me was that the job was pretty much collections. Calling customers and having them. Throughout these months I would have to call customers and ask about their payment status and such, but I would be trembling in fear while doing it. If a customer would start becoming aggressive (which happens frequently) I would be paralyzed in fear and on the verge of crying and just want to hang up. It gets bad and I dread every minute of it. On the way to work my heart pounds a million times a minute and I literally begin to feel ill to the verge of puking. I’ve also been avoiding a ton of customers just due to my fear.

Now end of September I said enough is enough and decided to go to my doctor. Explained to them these symptoms and told them about how I have anxiety and depression (I can elaborate on these if need be), so end up getting prescribed Zoloft and Xanax (if needed). The Zoloft has pretty crazy side effects at first and took a week off of work cause of it. Then my boss suggests that I file for short term disability. So I file for it and end up seeing a therapist and get the short term disability till about thanksgiving.

So I have a session with my therapist a week before I go back to work and she suggests to me I should do an IOP (intensive outpatient program) since I’m super scared to go back to my job. I end up calling one of the places that has IOP and long story short started that program last week. Called Aetna who handles my STD and they extended it to Dec. 11. Now the program I’m doing wants me to extend my STD and I’ve been calling Aetna about it and they said they need to contact my therapist and the program for more information. I’m just getting super paranoid and I have no idea what to do and am freaking out.

The other thing I want to ask is I just feel lost and that I’m worth nothing. People tell me to quit this job and if I do I see no future and hope for myself. I’m only at this job for insurance purposes, but the idea of working with people is so petrifying to me. I don’t know if anyone has any advice about this or if someone has experienced the same thing. If you need more clarification on things I’ll be glad to answer.",07Dec2017,1

50,"On Tuesday I was admitted into ER, with no knowledge of what day it was or how I got there. I later found out I drove myself and claimed I had amnesia. After 6 hours there were no signs of brain damage found, but through emails to my psychiatrist, another psychiatrist was able to determine I was perscibed 4mg of Risperdone instead of 1mg.

I still have not regained my memories of anything between Thanksgiving and December 5th, with some days before that being hazy as well. But here's where shit gets really weird. When I got home from the hospital I found some sort of massive conspiracy chart (index cards, pushpins, strings) on my wall involving a person named Joyce (name changed). I didn't know know anyone named Joyce so I asked a friend of mine about it. He told me we had been close friends for over a year. I looked at a picture of her on Facebook and I don't even recognize her.

Clearly some weird shit happened with this person but what I find strange is that I don't really care. I took pictures of the wall and then removed everything and out it away in a folder in case I need to present it. In the end there were over 50 index cards with titles and writing, and an envelope containing 30 front and back legal pad pages with letters addressed to Joyce. I didn't even feel like reading any of it.

It's strange because this is like some David Fincher type bullshit, but my brain is strongly discouraging me from investigating any of it. I really don't know what's going to happen if I see this Joyce person again either. Maybe it will jog my memory, but most likely I won't even recognize if I see her. I've already forgotten what she looks like again.

I don't know if I want advice or what, but for the love of God do not fuck with Risperdone. I have a lot to catch up on. ",07Dec2017,38
51,"I dated a girl named Kristen for about a year. (There were a few breaks in between.) Shortly after we broke up the final time, Kristen expressed via social media that I abused her. In truth, she was the one who was physically abusive and, consequently, felt defensive for having been. Unaware that I chose to keep my mouth sealed on the matter, Kristen went on Facebook, Tumblr, and Twitter to spout tirades regarding our relationship. She provided vague details but with the clear distinction that she was somehow wronged. Kristen often portrayed herself as a courageous survivor for overcoming the ex-boyfriend villain. She was now someone who could “grab life by the horns.” But I, on the other hand, felt degraded and dragged through the mud of Maury Povich-style drama.

My family can attest that I came home throughout the relationship riddled with scratches, bruises, and bite marks on my neck, torso, arms, and legs. These bite marks were not wanted in a sexual sense, nor were they cutesy love bites, but instead the detriments of Kristen’s uncontrolled rage. During our relationship, she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and undoubtedly continues to struggle with her illness to this day. I implored her to go to therapy and to ask for a regimen of mood stabilizers. She made a half-hearted effort to change her attitude but never refrained from hurting me.

Whenever a petty argument turned to shouting, I always promoted a cooling period. I planned to leave for the evening and return the following day. No blame, no grudge, no conflict. But this is usually when she blocked the door to her attic bedroom. With no other way to leave the house, I tried to shift my body past hers. There was no alternative because I was raised to never lay a hand on a woman. This is when she would latch on and bite me in order to keep me trapped. It came to the point that my family detested Kristen and urged me to leave the relationship. But this trial with Kristen was my first naïve attempt at love. I did not know any better than to expect things would get better.

But, as with most situations that require optimism in the face of sacrifice, things got worse. There is one event that comes specifically to mind. It happened sometime in Act II of our turbulent relationship. Late one night, Kristen thought I was asleep in her bed. The TV was still flashing its bright colors in the dark corner of her bedroom, and she was zoned out, idly watching it. It must have been a couple hours past whatever time we were used to going to sleep. She tried waking me with a gentle push. I distinctly remember that. But I didn’t move because I was exhausted and already dozing off. It was a thing of convenience for me to just pretend that I was asleep.

Then Kristen dragged me on top of her chest. I was in a pair of boxers and a T-shirt, quietly participating to see where this was going. (We were already sexually active in the relationship.) Then, before a moment had its chance to pass, she started putting on a deeply affected whimper, and I immediately opened my eyes. She was so beyond sick in the head to say I forced myself onto her. She tried to pawn it off as some sort of sleepwalking trance state, with me on the verge of raping her. And with the obvious response, “I’ve been awake this whole time,” Kristen immediately disposed of her—what would a person call it? her botched scheme? Never again was it discussed, and so it remained this strange thing that continued to hang over our ill-fated time together.

Another day, late into the relationship, Kristen and I were arguing in my car. We were in her parents’ driveway. I was dropping her off from school. Then out of habit, as a means to control both me and the situation, she clamped down on my forearm and would not let go—like a rabid animal. There is no other way to describe it. With all her strength, she was biting me. I begged her to let go. But she wouldn’t let go of my flesh, and so I begged her again and again. What more could I have done to stop her? She had already broken the skin. I was bleeding. She could taste blood, I was sure of it. And yet she persisted, sinking her teeth into me as hard as she could. I was afraid to pull away and have my flesh ripped any worse.

So, after three attempts in asking her to stop, to do the right thing and stop, I punched her in the arm. Whether it was a fight-or-flight response is not something I can honestly provide in confidence. I really don’t know. But I have my suspicions because it was the one time I ever struck a woman or partner, the one time in my entire life. And when the bruise on her arm started to show, I felt so ashamed of myself. I still feel ashamed, though I have reconciled it as a tense situation that required self-defense.

On another warm and sunny afternoon, Kristen tore my favorite shirt, a plaid flannel in jade green and black. She tore it right off me, button by button, completely ruined. And reflecting on this now in hindsight, it has become my interpretation that she did these things for the sadistic thrill of it because there were plenty of occasions we weren’t even arguing, including this instance with the shirt. In a similar situation, I was just lying on her bed taking a nap, this time a real nap, and she started punching me uncontrollably. The only thing that kept me rationalizing our personal history was the sincerity of her apologies. She balled her eyes out every single time, with the wailing and the hysterics.

When we finally did break up, as I stated before, she began spreading stories to counter the ones that she presumed I was spreading, a show of her neuroticism. She told just about anyone and everyone who would listen. And because of her toxic bullshit, I lost friendships with a number of people, including my favorite high school teacher, someone who I considered a role model and a close friend, and someone who I would still want back in my life to this day. We were suddenly not Facebook friends any longer, and I could take a hint to fuck off. Kristen used to babysit this teacher’s kids. So the only thing I thought in reaction was, “Damn. She got to her,” and, not only that, she got to her with all the time in the world to make up whatever she wanted to.

Without an adjustment period to let her so-called wounds heal, without any time at all, Kristen alternated between one set of negative emotions and another set, which was in stark contradiction of the venting. One moment she would post fan-fiction where she fantasized herself as the girlfriend of whichever boy-band singer or Phelps twin. The next moment she was flaunting her victimhood in preachy, ham-fisted posts. Both sentiments, I have come to interpret, are just two forms of navel-gazing.

Since those dark days, I have been with someone else. We have been together for six years. We started dating the same year as the break-up, and my girlfriend (who is very much loved) would certainly explain to anyone that I have never laid a hand on her. We’ve had arguments like any other couple, but not one of them has resulted in violence. Contrarily, we are both very non-confrontational people. It actually works when you have two halves that share the same moral principles. There came a point, however, that my girlfriend was tired of Kristen’s outbursts. She was tired of the excess and the self-marketing, and so she felt morally obligated to stand up for me.

Kristen expressed on Tumblr that she missed my company, and she even nostalgized our relationship on what would have been our two-year anniversary. My girlfriend, still calm and collected, as is her way of doing things, messaged Kristen anonymously. She asked her how she wasn’t contradicting her earlier posts and the so-called pride of being rid of me… “grabbing life by the horns” and all that. In response, Kristen said it was a difficult thing to explain. And, I mean, the logic checks out. Domestic violence is a complex issue. But the defensiveness that followed does not make any sense.

Kristen demanded to know who was asking the question, listed a series of names of people she thought would call her out, and then promptly closed the account. This occurred around the same time Kristen wished publicly that my girlfriend be put through the ‘same’ experience and be beaten, which is a sign of immaturity and jealously more than any real-life experience with abuse. And as much as the online incident stirred futility and frustration in the both of us, the day my girlfriend confronted Kristen with the objective truth, it seemed to have quieted the gossip. Although, I imagine it has reared its ugly head from time to time, undoubtedly packaged in small doses for those who have already heard the tale because, surely, time does not heal all wounds when there are people out there, like Kristen, who are capable of undying vitriol.

The same year as my breakup with Kristen I dated a girl named Emily, for two months. Emily, like Kristen, wanted to be a published author. She compulsively lied about finishing this novel or that novel. She would announce her page count and quarter-milestones online whenever she had the chance, with Emily craving the perpetual support and adoration of the entire world. She once told me she planned to work at a publishing house. She reasoned she could push her writings onto employers. Take for instance “Nightfall,” one of Emily’s short stories, her star project at the time we were dating. A cleverly named protagonist, Night falls to his death. And that story was the epitome of Emily: a kitschy writer with big dreams.

It was during this time that she used an impromptu title suggestion of mine for “Nightfall,” which she ultimately extended to the length of a novel. She renamed it because, as I offered in careful advice, “Nightfall” hits the nail on the head a little too hard, and it’s not worth giving away a major plot point before the audience has a chance to read your book’s opening line, amirite?

Levity aside though, looking purely at the facts, would Emily have operated so receptively to my suggestion if she had such a bad experience in dating me? This was her baby, her first novel that she self-published with either her or her parents’ money. Would she have taken my advice instead of someone else’s? I mean, she had all the time in the world to come up with something, anything.

She also had quite the cheering squad, as I recall. From one of her many unspoiled friendships, she could have taken their advice. That, or she could have made the brief attempt to come up with a one-word title on her own, because that’s what I did. And yet curious enough, in a campus-based interview, Emily was asked where the title came from and, lo and behold, she lied about its origin. This is because Emily is the last person to admit her shortcomings, let alone as a writer. She is sociopathic, the type of person to select her intentions like an outfit for the day, the type of person to dissociate from facts and revise history. She does it to come across as a more interesting, well-rounded person, embellishing anecdotes and fabricating stories purely to have someone listen. It is a very dangerous thing what I am describing.

At the start of our relationship, back in May of that year, she listed the names of every ex-boyfriend who, in some way or another, abused her. She even assigned run-of-the-mill arguments—arguments which were mutually the blame of her and another guy named Logan—the rank of verbal abuse. This Logan fellow must have really scarred her with his powerful words, which is a tad overreaching in my understanding of petty shouting matches. But rather than saying anything, I readied myself for the next tall tale.

Emily went to a pool party, she began, and one of the other guests was ex-boyfriend, Mark. I knew Mark. I went to school with him. He is best described as a rambunctious teddy bear, and he liked to hug everyone in drama club. He hugged me a couple times too, and I hugged him right back. He even hugged the girl who later became my girlfriend of six years running. To him, it was just a simple greeting. He would do it before class started. He had a lot of love to give, this Mark. He always had a smile on his face, and he laughed a lot.

Getting back to the pool party, Mark apparently tried to drown Emily. In front of a dozen eyewitnesses, he stuck her head underwater and, by God, he was planning to keep her there until she went limp. Having heard this anecdote, having heard it eagerly from Emily’s mouth, I resisted the urge to roll my eyes and said, “He must have been roughhousing.” Well, wouldn’t you know it, Emily insisted otherwise. “No! He tried to kill me.” All the while, the story ended—of course—with Mark letting her go by his own volition. In retrospect, this should have been a red flag. This should have been a reason to walk away.

We were just starting out as a couple, maybe three days in, and already I had the sneaking suspicion that this was a dangerous person. This was a pathological liar, someone like Amy Dunne without the riveting narrative of Gone Girl. But I shrugged off the Murderous Mark story because, after all, Emily was merely a spoiled teenager unaware of the consequences of her own words. Plenty of adults do the same thing. They have to discredit or trivialize their past relationships in order to build the importance of their current ones. This is not rare behavior.

In our progressive culture, there is a retaliatory type of partner who no longer says that such-and-such ex-boyfriend is bad in bed. They say he is a violent bully even when he isn’t. And to be clear, this form of lying is anti-feminist and detrimental to the progress we have made as a society. It is a disservice to the women and men who are victims, who have stories that deserve validation. I mean, there is no gentle way of putting this. It's sort of lost in the shuffle here, but I was later groped by a professor while I was going to college across the country. Do you think I feel ready to talk about it with anyone? Not with the reputation that I have acquired in my hometown. Those aren’t subjects I want to get mixed up in.

The grief is something to live with. It stays with the accused, and it eats away at them regardless of innocence because there isn’t a person out there who wants to be persecuted. The so-called witches of Salem, for instance, were not relieved in knowing that they were blameless of a crime. They burned at the stake. And while I am using the immense severity of their situation to illustrate my point, the message I hope is not lost. It is a difficult situation because the moment you have to start explaining yourself, the moment you have to start appealing to others a certain way to make your case, is the moment you forfeit the battle and lose.

Sometimes, with the haunting accusations that I have been faced with, I wonder to myself: Is there something I did wrong? Legitimately, is there anything at all that I did wrong? But I always arrive at the same conclusion, reviewing Emily’s behavior throughout the relationship. She appeared genuinely enthused. She hung all over me, even in front of her parents as we sat and chatted on their patio. And as one might have guessed in reading that last sentence, it was pretty fucking weird that she did that. But it still speaks to a phony, plastic, and ultimately unrealistic idea of our relationship that she had cultivated for us to use as a point of reference. Emily was constantly referring to herself as a hopeless romantic. She looked up at the stars and commented on the beauty of the stars because that’s what you’re supposed to do when you look at stars. She was so full of cinnamon-spiced shit.

Another evening, and here is a contradiction of Regency convictions, Emily undressed herself in her parents’ sunroom. This was not even two months into the otherwise gingerly paced relationship. She stripped down to a white bra and matching panties then urged me to have sex with her. I turned her down because I did not see us working out as a couple for much longer. I did not think it would be fair to take her virginity, nor did I want that responsibility. She only wanted to rescue us from the glaringly obvious decline in our relationship. Within two days, we were broken up and—easily within a week—Emily was dating a guy named Josh, and they were together for a while. In no way was this guy a rebound. He later became their class valedictorian. I was happy for her. I was happy there wasn’t any doom or gloom. I was happy we stayed Facebook friends, as trivial as it may sound. The break-up was amicable.

However, somewhere in the mix, Kristen contacted Emily, and they were suddenly friends of a superficial variety. What a coincidence. Fast forward to November (the sexual encounter back in June) and I was attending a high school production of one-acts. Many people were under the impression that I had abused Emily during the relationship. I was so deeply embarrassed that I had no way of defending myself. In fact, the buzz of their gossip sounded sleepy, like it had been sitting for a while.

Some acquaintances approached me with meager curiosity, like, ‘Sure, now we’ll hear your side since we’re bored on this particular night.’ They brought it up plainly and off the cuff. They might have been discussing their favorite colors before the topic made its casual entrance. ‘Oh, hey, Emily’s been saying this… Just thought you should know…’ In no way did anyone confront me as if the rumors were scandalous or urgent, and this ultimately felt worse. It felt like I had been robbed of my chance to nip it in the bud and stop this monstrous thing from being spread any further because, ‘Who gives a shit? Obviously not this guy who isn’t defending himself. Why isn’t he flailing his arms and panicking?’ And, honestly, I have to hand it to her. She kept me as a friend on Facebook where, as far as I could see, she made no such allegations. I was expertly walled off from any suspicion.

Worse still, here was a girl who wanted the public controversy, and for what? For feminist bragging rights? She wanted others to believe that a traumatic event shaped her into the woman she is today and provided her with priceless wisdom. How proud she would be if an honest victim came to her for council. I can already see the smug expression on her face. ‘Let me teach you how to meditate. It is essential for stress relief.’

This was the perfect opportunity for Emily to enhance her image, not that she devised the vengeful scheme on her own. The dead giveaway came in the form of little back-and-forths between her and Kristen, the ‘I’ll click the like button on your otherwise irrelevant stuff if you like my stuff’ kind of Facebook bullshit. It was enough proof for me to realize it wasn’t solely her idea to spread gossip because they are polar opposite personalities. One is psychotic and nearly friendless, and the other is more nuanced and socially regarded. They had no reason to interact with each other besides sharing a hateful alliance against me.

Upon my arrival, I remember her ‘fleeing’ from the other side of the auditorium. She kept looking over her shoulder with this exaggerated look on her face, like she was running from Godzilla or King Kong, like I had arrived with a machete. And keep in mind I was 50 feet away when she started for the wings. Also keep in mind that I was there to support her. It was a ridiculous stunt, and without having to shift my field of vision, there was Brenda, Emily’s mother sending me a big wave and a hello. “Look who it is!” she might have said in a sweet, motherly tone.

She must not have heard the news. According to pretty much every teenager in Brenda’s vicinity, her daughter had been abused and was quite broken up about it. Maybe it was intended—exclusively intended for susceptible children to hear. But still, months had gone by since the break-up, and quite a few chances to say something in the sunroom with Mom and Dad must have been pissed away by talking about anything else.

So it just made sense that Emily reserved her venting for unsuspecting millennials who were giddy at the thought of a moral crusade. But if she talked to a grown-up, things might’ve gotten a little too serious. She didn’t want to jinx her vacuum-sealed narrative that neglected to mention the part where she tried to fuck me the last day we saw each other as an item. That would be too messy to include. That would look poorly on her puritanical life with Prince Charming, and so this was the perfect motive for her to lie and hurt me.

The moment I realized Brenda was being totally sincere in manner, I was relieved in knowing that this nice lady did not think ill of me. But I was also nonplussed. I mean, this is her only child with whom she shares a healthy, unrestricted dialogue and a mutually close bond. Their household rivaled the sensibilities of The Brady Bunch, sans five kids and a maid. I spent two months with Emily and there was not a peep of negativity directed at either parent because they were ‘cool’ and double-functioned as peers.

Back to the one-acts, I returned a greeting to the lady. I said, “Hi, Brenda. How are you?” except the conversation was short-lived because I was making my way to the green room. I needed to hear what other people had heard, what friends of mine had heard. Seemingly everyone was aware of my plight and no one believed Emily, who had the reputation of being a sensationalist. But no one stuck up for me either, let alone were they outraged. The sense of betrayal I suffered has since led me to ongoing trust issues, and even my sense of humor has developed a misanthropic inclination.

Two years later, when I moved away, one of these so-called friends wrote on Facebook: “Knowing you're never going to see someone again, and there's nothing you can do about it, is the most awful, desperate feeling I've ever felt,” and these words shed light on how sincere a friendship can be. But like the others in the green room, this individual merely shrugged off what became one of my worst days.

In fact, the only peer who did not shrug (besides my current girlfriend who, at the time, was uninvolved) was Anna, a girl in Emily’s one-act, a girl who hardly knew me. She actually took the time to ask if the rumors were true, weighing the character evidence stacked against Emily and choosing to believe me once I explained my side. To this day, I am indebted to her for this small gesture. She did what no one else would, and it has gone a long way in terms of relief.

Both Anna and my girlfriend (especially my girlfriend) have provided all the validation I have needed through this hardship. Without knowing it, they have swayed me from suicidal tendencies that I once struggled with in my youth, which is something Emily knew about. Her father drove me home from a mental health facility when my own mother (after committing me for self-harm) refused to be my ride. That is ironically what catalyzed the relationship.

She was also there on the other end of a phone call when my brother ripped a lamp out of the wall and repeatedly hit me with it for talking to her. He liked her and thought she was his to claim. So it was plain for Emily to see that my home life was not as fortunate as the one she was gifted with. Shame on her and shame on Kristen for spurring a total loss of faith that I now have in people. Shame on them for plaguing me with this widely disregarded form of emotional abuse.

If only there were a Chris Hansen type of interviewer to help me when these things were still relevant, he could have asked the one: “Were you physically abusive toward anyone in your past?” and ask the other: “How did you react after being sexually rejected?” because these questions have gone unanswered for a very long time. There has been no cathartic release in all this time. And given the cultural climate, I align very much with what Terry Crews has said of his own experience. This is what PTSD feels like. PTSD is exactly what I am going through. I have been losing sleep over this, and drinking a lot of water in place of eating food. My stomach has been so tender.

With total gratitude, I thank you for reading. Reddit is the only place I feel comfortable telling my account without the worry of reopening old wounds, without the worry of these two perpetuating their agenda, which they now have to stick with for the rest of their lives, or else face the fact that they are awful human beings.",07Dec2017,6
52,"Hi. Im not sure if this is the sub for this or if theres other places to go. Im a student (22F) on the west coast of Canada struggling with depression and anxiety.

I was refured for an assessment a year and a bit ago after my family doctor diagnosed me, but due to moving, losing my insurance through a job transfer and other circumstance I was unable to get myself in for it.
I think one of the reasons I'm no longer coping well is Im just weary. I shouldnt be like this, right? Im young, I have a job that pays my rent and I can go to school still, I live with my wonderful boyfriend and another good friend... I just feel so grey some days though. Like a haze has covered me. I dont have many friends but i see them once a week, and as an introvert thats fine. But I just feel lonely and unmotivated and like im sinking and cant stop it.

I have tried medication, which my doctor prescribed. I was on ciprelax i believe its called, and while I felt more motivated it killed my libido and made me irritable in general. After a pharmacy issue where my dosage was inadvertently increased I stopped and have managed to deal with it all till this point. But im noticing its getting harder and I dont know what to do.

I want to be strong for me. And i dont want to put this emotional burden on my Boyfriend because he already does so much. I just dont know where to go from here.
So sorry for the ramble. This is longer than I thought it would be. Thanks for reading.",07Dec2017,1

Right now as a senior in high school,  I find myself depressed mainly because of stress and pressure; I’ve been hindered a lot because of it. Although people keep on telling me that I’m trying my best, I really think that I’m not and it kind of makes me upset that my poor work habits is even considered as trying. It makes me extremely frustrated that I was much more productive before and despite having overcome a similar situation with depression previously, I’m experiencing the same problems as before.    

I really want advice on how I could be productive despite my depression. Every time I try to work I start to get extremely anxious so I’ve been putting it off. ",07Dec2017,3

58,"Hey. There is something really wrong with me. I suffer from depression and anxiety. I have tendencies to be really abusive. It always happens with romantic partners. I've never had a healthy relationship in my life. I get over depended on my significant other. I get manipulative, jealous and sometimes even controlling. It scares me. It's because I love them. Because I'm scared they might leave me. Because I'm not good enough. There's no other way to keep them around. I'm so disgusted by myself. When my ex left me I threatened him and kept texting him and abuse him emotionally, I'd harm myself in order to get his attention, his love. I don't know what is wrong with me. I've heard issues like this usually come with a childhood trauma. But there's nothing traumatising I can remember. My childhood was nearly perfect. I experienced some minor bullying when I was little but that's it. Is there something more to it or am I just a horrible person?",07Dec2017,3

61,"I need some feedback on Abilify if people are willing to help.  I've got Bipolar 2 and major depression.  Currently on Lamotrigine, Escitalopram, Buspirone, and Lorazepam.  Having a hard time functioning...tried to work a real 8 hour day the other day and ended up having panic attacks and irrational fears.  Was immobile for two days, now barely functioning today.  Doctor prescribed Abilify to help with depression.  Lots of what I read online is not positive.  

Lifelong body image issues tie into this...I have seen a lot of people post that they gained weight on Abilify.  I was on Quetiapine for two years after a severe depression and although I explicitly told the doctor I didn't want something that would make me gain weight I gained over 20 pounds anyway.  I know myself well enough to know that I am not going to feel better if I'm heavier.  (I'm a performer...looking at pictures of myself is torture to the point where I don't want to perform anymore because I'm terrified of what costume I'll be put into.) 

Also wondering if I need a new doctor (may have no choice after needing to change to a cheaper ACA plan).  This one can't seem to get the combination right and I am tired of constantly playing phone tag and making adjustments.  Also tired of the side effects: The weight gain, the exhaustion, the brain fog, the apathy.  

Any insight would be helpful...have never posted here so your support is appreciated...can't go to Facebook or a forum like that because I'm a local public figure and have too many connections that follow me there. ",07Dec2017,1
63,"Hello everyone! in 2018 I’ll be getting outside and walking/running/hiking 1000 miles to raise awareness for mental illness and raise money to donate to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. I'll be challenging others to join me in getting outside in 2018 and opening the conversation about mental illness in the outdoors! Getting outdoors and exercising is the best therapy I've found for my own mental illness.

I'm hoping to find some inspiration here for a good Instagram handle for this cause - MilesforMentalIllness would be perfect if it wasn't so long. I want to make a t-shirt with the name on it as well and I'm hoping that this could be something I turn into a non-profit! So I need a good name!

Any ideas are helpful. Thank you!",07Dec2017,29
