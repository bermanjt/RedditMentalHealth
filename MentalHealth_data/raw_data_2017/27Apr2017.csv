0,Almost everyday I'm reminded of something I once said or did that was dumb but I'm still embarrassed about all of those things. They're all minimal and not worth worrying about but I'm not sure why/how it happens. Is this normal?,27Apr2017,56
2,"Hi everyone. A friend of mine has recently graduated from high school, 19. He works most days, second shift. The person who I gather is closest to him is his mom, who I see has hyperparented him his whole life. He has a very timid very slothy nature, and she's always been electrically riding him on things. She's a well meaning but unstable lady..

Anyways, besides me, my friend doesnt have much connection. Now that hes out of school, he has no social institution (Which I think may be a part of his problem Ill mention now).

Today he texted me about a lonliness hes been feeling:

""I just feel a kind of empty sadness. it keeps making its way back to me

""It's kinda like no one is there. Not even yourself. you FEEL the sadness as if it is now all you are. maybe a little anger that you can't send it away and grab the real you that will ocassionally flare back up for short bursts. but then you leave yourself again shortly after. it's like being a bear in hybernation. you dream things for a long time, none positive, just to wake and actually live...till the long sleep comes again""

Do any of yall have any suggestions for him given these details?
Thank you

6,"Hey guys, I got out of my depression two years ago but I still have some ups and downs (wouldn't call it depression) mainly because of negative thoughts.

For some reason, every time I think about past events in my life: High School, First relationship, University, Dating Life and many others, I can only remember the bad side of it. The parts where I screwed up, was mean, or disappointing.

I know that it's not how truly went on and that I was mostly happy when they happened but I can only remember the negative side. As if my brain forgot the good parts. Selective Memory?

Does anyone know if there's a solution to this/if it's a known thing?

Thanks",27Apr2017,1

21,"My appearance is already very nerdy, to the extent people seem to identify me as a nerd by my appearance alone. I notice that when I act dumb, naive and cute, more people want to be my friend or just like me more in comparison to me using my brains. Maybe it's also the anti depressants and sleeping pills I've been on lately, but I find there's less times during the day where I actually THINK and instead I just feel automated and there's this thing that prevents me from seeming smart. According to my IQ I'm supposed to be a genius.

Anyway, I really WANT to like nerds but it just seems dumb and cute (apparently I look 'cute' as well) is better than being nerdy. I especially dumb myself down in front of my parents and even my voice changes to seem dimmer. I have ADHD, and also during the 'dumb' mode I just stop inhibiting it and so I act all hyper and stupid. People love that.",27Apr2017,3

28,"I don't really like self diagnosing or anything but I am absolutely convinced I have bipolar II, I've said it for about a year but my hypomanic episodes do not last very long and neither do my depressive, my norm is just flat line bored empty and unstimulated unsatisfied.  I had my first depressive episode for 8 months and I think 3 weeks into the anti depressants I was having a diagnosed hypomanic episode, so I know what it feels like, I felt great, but also uncomfortable, I needed no sleep and would feel like running everywhere, sometimes have extremely dramatic emotional outbursts crying from normal things overwhelming me, and then we lowered the dose and since then I've been more less ""stable"" in the long run. But I noticed during exams when I didn't sleep, I was experiencing hypomania again which I mentioned to my psychiatrist but it didn't make him worry, I just felt extremely awake 24/7 could go forever without sleeping, I felt urges to do inappropriate things, in Sainsbury's I was very close to just running and knocking all the stuff on the shelves down just for the sake of it. I got prescribed sleep tabs for a bit and getting my sleep cycle back I think stopped the episode. I felt this again at uni when I was stressed about changing subjects/quitting and started to experience extreme irritability with hypomanic. Crying over loosing mascara, raging in streets, constantly gurning with terrible headaches, feeling hyper and good for short times. Also after a breakup I remember engaging with a lot of people sexually, and feeling super overwhelmed by people, and the next day I would talk really fast and wouldn't listen to people, it was as if I was just in my own world, at first I don't recognise it as hypomania, just think I feel ""weird"". Then again today after lack of sleep for a while, I realised I couldn't stop talking and wasn't even finishing my sentences, and thought, I must sound fucking retarded to this person but I can't stop really. Then when I was walking home I was behaving weirdly, like I felt weird like I didn't care what anybody around me thought, and was just getting really anxious about life, and then got home and behaved weirdly just saying things bravely to my dad, messaging people I wouldn't normally, but I'm so aware of these mood changes. This is the only way I can describe it cos I just feel weird but not bad, kind of fun, just like energy in my body and lack of awareness and thought about what I'm doing. Writing this now I've never typed so fucking fast. But yeah. Can you have these episodes without bipolar cos I only really get them from stress and sleep deprivation, so yeah.",27Apr2017,1

30,"Hello Reddit. I take Celexa (20 mg) for anxiety and it generally treats me pretty well, except when I miss a dose, which is unfortunately often given that I also have ADD and have trouble sticking to a pill regimen. I'm working on this.

When I miss a single dose, I'm usually fine. After a few days, though, I get brain zaps like a motherfucker and pretty marked agitation/irritability. I experience a lot of misophonia and sensory overload. Sounds, light, human interaction - everything is annoying.

Besides, you know, taking my pill ASAP (not really in my control at the moment, as I'm having issues with a nonresponsive doctor's office) or curling up into a ball and imploding, do any of you have similar experiences with SSRI withdrawal and/or advice for handling it?",27Apr2017,1
31,"Okay, so I was dealing with some pretty severe body dysmorphia this week, which is slowly subsiding. My problem now is I am on the cusp of crying all the time. If the conversation gets ""real"" at any point I really have to choke back the tears which is not usual for me at all. I just want to start balling. I went out for lunch and almost every subject had me very emotional. I could have started crying full-on at any point. I'm not pmsing or anything like that. Could this be depression? I do have G.A.D. Any coping skills or any helpful information would be greatly appreciated.

33,"*TLDR at the bottom*

I should mention I suffer symptoms of anxiety, depression and hypochondria. I often get these destructive, negative thoughts saying I'm worthless and people don't like me. They are usually triggered by something that happened or something I did or said which I regret afterwards. Talking to my parents today made me realize something about these thoughts and why it's neccessary to deal with them in a different way then how i've been dealing with them. So I wrote this letter to myself, so I can read it whenever another thought pops up.

""florisgrif19, when you read this you are experiencing a difficult thought. Perhaps it's about something you did, or said? Or maybe you remember something bad or embarassing you did in the past that only you know about? Or something that might be wrong with you. This thought is trying really hard to push you into the wrong, 'bad' corner. Making you feel like you are worthless, or a bad person. Right now, you probably feel like you want to 'solve' this thought, remove it from your mind so that everything will be all well and good again. You wanna comfort yourself, convince yourself that everything is gonna be okay. Here's the thing though. You will never be convinced. It's never completely 'okay' Every 'solution' you will come up with, will create ten new problems. When you talk to someone, you'll be afraid that they didn't think anything weird about you before, but because you've talked about it now they do. Or you'll be afraid that whatever they say, they are just saying it to comfort you. When you start searching on the internet hoping to find some answers you will only believe the negative things you read, not the positive.
There is only one solution:Let it go. Let go of this nasty, unhelpful negative thought. Seriously how is this thought in any way helpful?

Try to think about this from a different perspective. You have two parents that love you immensely. You have a sister that cares about you. A big family that loves you and cares about you. A couple of friends who are there for you and appreciate you. You are almost done with college and have been working so hard on school assignments. You have hobbies and passions and are incredibly creative. You love to travel and go on long walks through beautiful landscapes. You are an empathic person who likes helping people. You are sensitive and incredibly intuitive. You have great musical talent. You have lots of knowledge about a broad range of subjects. You are involved with the world and it's problems. You have a good sense of humor. You are intelligent. You are a nice, helpful guy who is there for others when they need him. You have so much love to give.

But here's the thing: **you are not perfect.**
You did something stupid. Said something weird. Had a strange thought. Got mad at someone for no reason.
Here's the thing though: **Nobody is perfect**
Everyone makes mistakes.
But your thoughts are trying to tell you that, because you made that mistake, you can't be part of this world anymore. That when people find out you did/said/thought this, they won't care about what a good person you are and what qualities you have.

Newsflash: that's not how people are and that's not how people think. The reason you think that is that your brain has created a hostile and inaccurate image of other people and the outside world. Because you think only in terms of 'good' and 'bad', and not in the millions of nuances that are possible in that spectrum. It's a bizarre, strange way of thinking that will get you nowhere.

florisgrif19, there is only one way that will help you deal with this thought. One efficient, helpful way to move forward. Let go of this thought. Don't fight it. Don't try to strangle it. Don't run away from it. But don't embrace it either. Just let it be. Like all thoughts, it will dissappear. But not if you keep trying to change it or remove it. Then it will sting and get worse like an ugly infection. But leave it be, and eventually, like all things, it will go away.""

*TLDR; Have destructive thoughts about something I did/said/thought that was 'bad' or something bad that might happen to me, wrote myself a letter about how nobody's perfect and the only way to deal with these thoughts is to let them go.*",27Apr2017,3
34,"I am going to see a new doctor who uses TCM therapy. They want to discourage the use of drugs, as the point of the therapy is to be an alternative to pharmacological medicines. Apparently it uses electromagnets to stimulate areas of the brain.

37,"First post here...and I'm at the end of my rope.

As the title suggests, my 13 year old son has an undiagnosed/unknown (at this point) mental health condition. 

We have been attempting to find help for him for about 7 years now. He is on a Medicaid based state insurance program, which limits our access. Basically, we go to his primary physician, describe the symptoms and behaviors he exhibits and get referrals for basic counseling. Aside from a one hour visit with an Autism specialist (which they did not diagnose him with any autism spectrum disorder), we have not been successful in getting him in to see a specialist. Either we are referred for counseling, or denied a referral altogether.

His symptoms are the following:

- Diagnosis of ADHD (prior to many of these symptoms - at age 5)

- Slurred, disorganized, overlapping and often incomprehensible speech (hard to describe, but talks like an auctioneer but slower)
- Seems unable to express emotions - if he does, it seems awkward and sometimes completely inappropriate for the situation
- Short temper
- Always wants to be in control of situations - many times he will say or do things that are ridiculous (during confrontations or arguments) simply to ""one up"" myself or whomever the other person 
- Very immature, often acts and behaves much younger than he is
- Has reported hearing a voice that calls his name 
- He's very reclusive - prefers to be alone 
- Very awkward social interactions - constantly doing things to annoy others, invading others' ""personal space""
- He's 13 and is basically done with puberty - however he is exhibiting sexual behaviors that seem a little extreme (I.e. Caught him with his cousins panties, using them for masturbation, she is 6 years younger than him)
- Unresponsive to CBT - he doesn't talk - just stares at the person 

It seems like his doctor and other therapists who see him either don't want to dive in and really evaluate him and chalk it up to his ADHD and ""depression"". When I bring up some of the above symptoms - especially the speech - they see him and he does his ""stare"" - it appears as if they may believe that I'm exaggerating or possibly lying - they don't do anything. He doesn't talk, so they don't see it.

I'm done - he needs a full psychological evaluation. Before these behaviors get him in serious trouble (specifically the sexual things)

What should I do at this point? We've exhausted all options in my small-ish city and due to his insurance we have restrictions on out of county referrals. 

Any suggestions on how to press through this ""brick wall"" 
I seem to keep running into?

40,"I'm so so worried. I have BPD+anxiety disorder and generally manage my mental health pretty well these days. I've had a lot of therapy and tried numerous medications. I've been with my husband 4 years, married for 2. He's always seemed awkward and difficult to a certain level and since the beginning, I've known of his aspergers. He has suddenly deteriorated. He's having constant delusions and hallucinations, thoughts and attempts of suicide. He's now been detained at a psych ward in hospital for almost a week as a 'long term' patient.  He hasn't been officially diagnosed yet but they seem certain that he has not only aspergers but also schizophrenia. I'm devastated and feel awful for him, I feel uncertain of our future together and quite frankly, I'm terrified about it all. Upon release from the ward, he'll be coming back home to me. I want to care for him but I'm equally frightened. Is his condition manageable? Can a high functioning borderline cope with an autistic schizophrenic husband? I'm freaking out!",27Apr2017,5
