13,"I have had symptoms of depression and anxiety the last few months and decided to investigate the cause of all of the symptoms.

I got bloods done and it came back as me having low testosterone.

The doctor prescribed some meds to get my T levels back to normal and after a few months of being off the meds my T levels are back in the normal range. I started to feel better than before...

Now the last couple of weeks I have been feeling very irritated, getting angry and upset about the smallest things, especially while driving I have wicked road rage, and I don't know why.

My wife and I constantly argue about small things that I am not willing to do and I don't feel like getting involved in social situations.

I feel like I just want to be left alone, but when I am alone I feel even worse ie low mood and willingness to do anything.

I feel frustrated because I don't know what is going on with me. I feel unsatisfied with everything although I have many things to be thankful for.

Please help me to feel better, as I don't know where to start.",26Oct2017,3
14,"Hello

I know it isn't going to help any of us resolve the situation, but my ex partner turned on me and walked out on our family last year after becoming emotionally abusive, i was convinced at the time he had severe depression, he turned really nasty after a death in the family.

I begged him to see a doctor but he just accused me of wanting everyone to think he's crazy because i wanted him sectioned ( never gave a reason why I'd want that).

I thought things would get better after he left because then he wouldn't be able to blame me for everything anymore, he'd have to take responsibility for himself, i believed and still do that I'm just an enabler as long as I'm around to blame. 

In a way things are better my anxiety is gone and i feel stronger more myself, our child is getting more adventurous and causing less trouble at school.

But my ex is still blaming, he has a new girlfriend but that hasn't stopped him, he blames me for the fact he's stressed out at work, he's getting evicted soon because the landlord is selling the building apparently thats my fault, everything my fault and he claims I'm telling lies about him and turning our childs school against him etc.

I've tried to cut him off, for my own mental well being but that didn't work he just harassed me, ringing my phone over ten times, banging on my door, showing up at the school.

I had to contact again via text which seemed to calm him down, nothing i say goes into his head its like he's in a bubble.  And we just go round and round in circles. At this point I'm only continuing to try and keep him at arms lengh as i just don't know him anymore and have no idea what he's capable of.

The circle goes like this,
 i try to reach out to him\ be nice\express that we love and miss him. 
He responds with demands\ moaning about how stressed he is\blame saying he's never coming back,
 i attempt to push away pointing out i dont want him back and he's creating his own stress with his behaviour\i try to ignore him\ cut him off. 
He turns nice saying sorry, please, promising to give child support money.

Then i either start from point one again or continue trying to ignore\cut him off in which case he will turn more nasty and creepy.

I'm just at a loss as to whats going on with him, i have come to the conclusion that what i keep seeing is paranoia aimed at me, he's redrawn and miserable but also aggitated you can see it, he's easy to trigger to anger and his minds gone, he used to be really good at maths now he needs a calculator, he can't remember stuff or his memory is completely twisted. He also sometimes seems to work himself up into an aggitated state without any contact with me and i just get a strange text or message damning me for something out of the blue, its as if he's continuing an argument we never had.

But at the same time last year i was so sure it was severe depression he had all the symptoms and i mean all but now there seems to be more. As i said i know it wont help anything he refuses to see a doctor and says I'm the one who's crazy (ive never used that word) but i just I don't know i guess I need to have some idea whats going on with him to figure out if there's some better way to deal with this mess.  

He behaves like butter wouldn't melt in his mouth around others, sometimes he slips up and some people cotton on to their being something going on with him but no one else yet gets all the crap i do.",26Oct2017,2
16,"I'm in my second year of college. I keep having periods where I can't bring myself to get up, leave my room, and go to my classes. I don't have the motivation. This happened last semester and I had to drop all of my classes to avoid failing. I did my hardest class over the summer by itself and did very well with no issue, so I thought I'd be able to just go right back in and continue as normal, but I can't. I know that I'd be doing well if I could attend classes normally, but I can't.

As soon as I miss one class, suddenly I'm skipping all of them. I'm not doing any homework, so I'm sure I'm really behind and my grades are poor. There's a place that's supposed to help students keep up, and I'm scheduled for weekly meetings there, but I can't go to those either. Anything that involves school is just, blocked out for me. I should have made this post weeks ago, but I couldn't even do that until now.

I've been diagnosed with depression and I'm taking medication for it, but it's not helping. I don't even feel sad, and I am having fun doing things on my own/with friends, so I don't even know if that diagnosis is right.

I don't know what to do. I do like it here, but I think college might not be something I'm capable of doing, but if I don't, then I have no idea what I'd do with my life.

I was born with all the opportunities in the world but I can't even bring myself to use them.",26Oct2017,2
17,"There was an incident that occurred over the course of four weeks about a week ago. One day in particular, I woke up and everything and everyone felt different, changed. Everything looked the same and my relationships didn't appear to have changed at all but everything suddenly felt off, and the feeling has not gone away now. Everything feels surreal, like a never-ending dream.

It's making me more anxious around people than I already was, and I've been feeling a foreboding regarding attempting to befriend anymore people and about the relationship with my current group of friends.

I've never felt like this before, and my sleep habits have become irregular again. 
I'm not really sure at what point that I should seek help for what I'm feeling or how I could go about seeking help.

21,"Hey r/mentalhealth 

**TLDR: In college, ADHD and Depression kill my life daily, have accommodations for the former but not the latter. Services for Students with Disabilities has stupid rule that makes accommodations not apply retroactively, so anything I've gone through because of disability means jack shit. Professors can be lenient on their own but you have to approach them. Not common that they are that lenient with a student who has been behind/missed class/not been very communicative. Process for getting accommodations is a little lengthy. Feel trapped, late work is cyclical and I don't know how to get out of this even though I want to. **

I'm a sophomore in college and struggle daily if not hourly with my mental health. I've had ADHD all my life and only found out going into Junior year of high school and have been slowly coping with that and take meds for it which help. But mainly I've struggled with deep depression for a long time but only really realized so in the last year or so.

Every day I struggle to get my work done in college and if I do it's usually because I planned extremely far ahead and had a random push of motivation. Right now I'm posting this because currently, I have two assignments way past due, a book and a half behind in reading, and have missed way too much class to the point where I am concerned about one of my classes that has daily quizzes (attendance tests really) that make up a huge portion of my grade. 

One assignment was a film review on a documentary that was due 10/17 and its 5 points off for every day late. I'm only like a page in on it and I can never get myself to complete it.
Second is a take home test that I didn't prepare for and then turned out to be two five page essays that were due on 10/24 but I only started an hour before it was due because I thought it was due later that night at midnight. 

I've talked with CMHC (Counseling and Mental Health Center) on campus and they want to help me get accommodations for depression but as of right now it's a lengthy process. I've had previous psychiatrists and counseling in the past but now am looking for a new private practitioner because the guy I had last year ended up not working out. Additionally, there's gonna be some time until I can get the diagnosis from them probably considering that doesn't happen on a first appointment. I still have to call around from a list I was given to figure out who I want to choose.

Additionally I have accommodations for my ADHD right now but because of some shit law with book publishers I'm not allowed to own PDFs of their books to run through my text to audio program even though I own their books physically. And I'm allowed to go scan them by myself in a library for like three hours page by page but the University has that as an option to give to people but not to me because I don't have a disability like (or similar to etc.) dyslexia. 

Everywhere I look it feels like there's roadblocks stopping me from being happy and being productive. Anytime I'm late on an assignment it makes me feel guilty and I just push it away even when I want to tackle it. This film review I just can't get done even though it's relatively simple. *I'm just so afraid of how this will all hurt me in the end that I think I'm hiding from the eventual product of this by not completing it and seeing the grade I receive. *

Also **no accommodations I get can be applied retroactively** which fucking sucks. So if I got an attendance accommodation that also helps me with due dates, I'm not allowed to apply that to anything I've gone through already even though nothing has changed. I was going through the same things now as I was then but it doesn't matter to the system. They say there at the Services for Students with Disabilities office that I can ask Professors personally about being lenient and helping me and maybe fixing things in the past for me but that's fucking *TERRIFYING* for me. Additionally it kind of is tone-deaf and doesn't help me because they can't vouch on my side when I go up to one of my professors and they just say no because the services place is who decided things don't work retroactively. 

Also the class I have those two assignments late in is a class with a foreign professor (who is great and funny and all but) is not very helpful on accommodations or anything like that. Additionally I have the attendance test based class that has a professor who says we only have to take the final to fill in for **three tests at max** that we missed and there are no other ways you can retake a test even if you were in the hospital. He was nice when I approached him about accommodations regarding ADHD but that wasn't about things in the past.

Also I've totally fucked up my nutrition, sleep cycle, and sense of time. Really doesn't help any thing going forward. Is both a symptom and cause of shit.

This is my last semester that can count on my GPA for my application for an internal transfer into a new major for Game Design. I previously was in architecture which is a whole story by itself of how it fucked my life and head up. It also fucked my GPA and punished me for being in a major that I shouldn't have been. All this stress is making me lose my mind especially when this is the last semester to ***prove*** that I'm worthy of admittance.

I know this is a whole lot Reddit, and not all my answers are going to come from strangers online, or any of my answers (TBH), but what do I do?",26Oct2017,3
23,"I posted on here a few days ago regarding my girlfriend being stuck on a counselling waiting list. She suffers from a mix of depression, anxiety, insomnia, issues with self-worth, perfectionism and alcohol dependency. This has been going on for quite a few years and she's been using alcohol to cope for the majority of it, drinking herself massively drunk several times a week (feel free to look at my history to get a full idea of it). It's been a frustrating time and i'm having difficulties coping with it myself. and I've never been quite sure how to handle it. I've been treating the situation as if she were an alcoholic. Though she is now on a counselling waiting list, I've also suggested to her that she attends an alcoholics support group. She refuses to accept being an alcoholic though and states instead that she uses it to cope, and that this is different.

Today i came across the term of self-medicating with alcohol and i'm beginning to question how i should be viewing this. Aren't all alcoholics essentially self-medicating for something? It's clear she needs to come off the alcohol if she wants her situation to improve but it's gotten to the point where she basically justifies it by stating 'Hello. Mental health issues here.' and basically has another drink. Obviously i'm not denying that she has the mental health issues, but it's painful heading over to her place just to spend several hours watching her being drunk, getting more drunk and watching her be miserable the entire time, hoping that when she falls asleep she'll run out of alcohol so that the next morning she'll be sober enough to stay away from it for a little while longer (which is basically the state i left her in this morning). On the one hand it feels like she's just plain refusing to accept any responsibility for her situation, but on the other, it's a mental health issue, and should i be expecting her to be responsible at all?

I want to help, but I've spent several years now being supportive, being there to talk, comforting her, taking her seriously, arranging activities for her. I've made it clear to her that i won't buy alcohol for her, or bail her out financially because she's been wasting her money on alcohol, nor will i take alcohol off her, because i understand that this has to be something she does for herself, no matter how much i want to just grab every bottle of wine i see and start pouring it down the sink. I've had a ton of help from the al-anon subreddit, but i don't know if i should even be treating this like alcoholism or as self-medicating as part of her mental health issues. Honestly i'm just lost on what my best course of action should be. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

30,"I was, for a time, able to see a psychologist.  Unfortunately, as I live in Toronto, I could not afford to see him for long enough to get anywhere.  For those who don't know, Canada offers two things to the mentally ill in the public system: jack, and shit.  

Before we got cut off, however, he mentioned that I have what he termed a ""self disorder"".  I haven't been able to see him again to speak about it.  While I have found a wikipedia article, I can't find much else on this.  What's more, it isn't in the DSM, nor do any of the various psychiatrists I get any time with have any knowledge about it.  

A lot of what I read in that aforementioned article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-disorder) made sense to me, and I'm wondering if any of you have any experience with it, or any information about self disorder.  ",26Oct2017,2

32,"I havent been to the psihiatric doctor yet, but i think i might have been bipolar. I have manic events literally lasting for around a year or two and than i have depression sessions lasting for almost that long also wich include pain in the back of my head lasting for almost the whole time. Is it possible that i am bipolar or is it some other problem? Or this is not a problem at all?

The issue is this is repeating in an endless manner, so when my depression is over, the other episode kicks in and so on. This is happening since i can remember, even before primmary school, so i never looked into it as ilnees. But it is really making my life hard, since i loose everything during my depression episode. I mostly play video games during that time and go to school, where i am avoiding friends, because every inappropriate word towards me makes depression worse and the pain in my head. I am so happy when the manic episode comes and i try to drag it as long as i can, but i cannot run from what is coming towards me...

33,"So it's well documented that trauma can screw with a person's mental health long after the event is over, but I can't find anything similar to what happened to a friend of mine, and I'm stumped. 

A year ago a friend went from an incredibly empathetic person to... near on empatheticly devoid, after a particularly traumatic week-long event involving family. Other side effects seem to be a decrease in anxiety, and a much more lackadaisical approach to everything. They're aware the change occurred, and to my knowledge they're not suddenly sociopathic or anything. 

Is this a permanent change? An indication of something else going wrong? Has this happened to anyone else before? It's put an enormous strain on our friendship and I don't know what to do, for them or me.",26Oct2017,2

37,"I already have a Reddit account with over 1000 karma, but I don't want to link it to this one. If anyone wants to see proof of that account, message this one.

I am atheist. My father never does anything for me, and explains everything through the Christianity, in a way that is hard to disprove.

He prevents me from doing homework (nobody at school knows about this), and when I have a lot of work to do and am concentrating, he comes in and starts asking me to do something for him (for example do something on his laptop), and when I tell him that I am working, he repeats his request and says that my denial is ""devils coming out"".

Next, he would take my phone, so I have to do my homework using the school computers in the mornings, or after school. I normally make myself seem happy (inside, it's dreadful, particularly then), and uses that to say ""without your phone, you are happy"", gives it back after a couple of (school) days, and the cycle repeats again.

This is even harder to stand bearing in mind my school. I live in the uk, and a year ago I moved from a fairly average private school, to one of the top 5 in the country for academic success (that's for sure). In my old school, I used to be very academic and among one of the top pupils in the year, but my new school has so much more studentd of my type, that I am now slightly above average among them. He still expects me to be #1 in my class.

We moved recently, and he demanded that I organise everything for the move - the removals service, moving broadband, and packing (all) the boxes in the house.

When I listen to my favourite music (Moby), he tells me that it's ""satanic"", and instead puts on lectures about Christianity. I especially hate this, because then I have to tell him the contents of the lecture.

He also makes me read the Bible and tell him sections of it. It's horrible.

With school 6 times a week and an intensive sports session 4 times a week (he made me pick the sport ""to get into good universities""), I have very little spare time. All my spare time is taken up by his tasks for me, so I can't remember the last time when I did something fun for over 30 minutes, with his approval (I normally play games on my phone, when I have it, to relieve the stress).

I'm not smart enough to connect with the really smart people I know.  One of them, I like reading his blog (well, trying to read it.. sometimes it's over my head). He has a PhD in philosophy. I get stuck when he references things I have no clue about.  I have a masters in engineering but I find the arts really interesting.

The problem is I'm weird. I'm not a normal guy. I don't like superficial conversations, and it's not enough to keep my attention.  I also tend to lack the social skills most people take for granted.
