1,"Hello, thanks for reading! I have always been curious about this...when I was a little girl, there was a period of time where every night when I laid down in my bed, if I closed my eyes I would hear what sounded like hundreds or even thousands of adult voices, both male and female, arguing. I could never make out the words, but it sounded somewhat like what you would hear in a crowded airport-but with all the voices arguing in really harsh, angry tones. The cacophony of voices would grow louder and louder, and it felt truly terrifying and sickening to hear. It was like something you would hear in a horror movie, just angry voices building, getting more and more threatening. When I opened my eyes, the voices would stop. I'm not sure how long this went on, but I remember it being 'normal' to me at the time (although still scary), so I guess it went on for at least a few months. If I had to guess, I would say I was 5 years old.

I am 24 now, and I know I have anxiety and depression. I have had 2 other auditory hallucinations in my life, both during broad daylight: once around 9 years old, I hear a male voice say my name loudly (but I was definitely alone). At 12, I heard a pet crying even though it had passed away.

Can anyone help me to understand this? Is it worth bringing up to my therapist? I'm not really worried, just very curious. Thanks for any and all insight!",13May2017,2
2,"26/M, vancouver bc is my home region and I'm overwhelmed by everything. I wanted a red seal in a trade so bad before I turned 30... as a caveat worth noting I have recorded ""anxiety disorder"" and ADHD. been in poverty pretty much whole life.

I took introductory trade classes back in beginning of 2014. on a wait list from summer 2012. decided that working in steel construction would be a good carrier to build from cause the money is good, plus I loved metal art. Went to fab shops to try and find a company to sponsor and a group of people... couldn't stick with it for a multitude of reasons. Sept 2015 working in between work Did a 6 month foundation in that, struggled and passed in feb 2016, work was slow, as much as I like fab shop there never seemed to be enough work. There's a scream for ""skilled laborers"" and those with red seals or on their way there... but hardly anyone hiring first year... that didn't help.

plus the rising house prices r/vancouver will tell such tales made... more anxiety, plus I may lose my home.... so we'll I was in school for fab I kept looking out the window and realizing that I wanted to travel more and a camp/LOA job (flyin/flyout) as a skilled labor or at least to work my way into one and having a fab background wasn't gonna cut it...so knowing this and how long wait lists take at my trade school I finish fab... and signed up for ironworking mid way though the program.

and oh boy what a decision this was.

I finished in feb 2016.... still struggling I worked many different jobs and set up intake so I've been back at school in this new program (same building strangely enough) doing this thing. Apparently my timing has been good to be in school it's been really fucking slow as of recent in industry. Struggling at foundation things I've already done (cause steel is steel, in our jurisdiction a red seal ironworker or welder is considered a level one in fab cause they are similar on a base level)  barely passing the content I don't know and really doing bad with the math despite all the time I put into doing it with several different tutors (every single time)

We'll I'm near the end and I know I have a hard time with heights...something I could probably overcome but its absolute hell trying to do so, we'll keeping up with all the paperwork school requires, the pressures of personal life, plus all the bullshit one would deal with at a mock jobsite such as this, (all with inexperienced students who I'm sure feel similar in many different ways cause they all want to do well, but at least they have the marks and good records to back them up.) The union of our trade will likely take everyone in our class save for me and another guy (who's repeating- this is his second attempt, I'm sure its pretty shitty for him too)

so I gotta find my own way when I'm done even...something I had a hell of a time with. I'm sure you'll suggest, ""eat better, exercise, sleep better"" all things I should be doing but just can't keep consistent with. I see counselors and stretched out my resources to do well. 

(TLDR)feel helpless, been in and out of school and work to find a way to make a skilled trade work and get the certificate, go out on camp and make mad money. While I did everything in my power in the moment to get this far I'm running out of steam and could fail this whole thing. Been trying so hard to get something good going in the last 5 or 6 years with no real ground being made, feels like a waste of time. Even if I graduate, I'll be in the hole 13 thou on student debt, nearly broke and with no real job prospects in a tough market, tough enough that I lack the self confidence to go in and get it being green

3,"In case you didn't know, there was an incident in Kirkersville, OH today where a man shot the chief of police  (36 yrs old, 6 kids, a 7th on the way, 3rd week on the job), then went into a nursing home and shot two nurses (one of them was his ex) before shooting and killing himself. He had a past record of several domestic violence charges dating from 1992-2016, but I had never seen that side of him. The media is only reporting his record, they aren't talking about the fact that he is very bipolar and does not take his medication. He was one of the best friends someone could ask for. If you needed something he was there to help. My mom wanted to visit her dad in Florida but couldn't drive the 14 hours alone with just my brother (also Bipolar) so he went with her. When her grandmother died he drove from Ohio to New Mexico and back with a uhaul just to make sure my mom got to bring everything that was left to her home. He was a great guy when he took his meds, and a great guy most of the time off of them. However, the bipolar made him obsess over his ex, the anger would become uncontrollable and he'd beat her, go to jail, she'd take him back, and it would happen again. When she eventually left him for good, this obsession got worse. And today he decided that he was going to kill her. I feel so bad for all of the victims and their families, it's a terrible thing  that never should have happened. But I'm devastated that he did it and that he is no longer with us. What he did was horrible, but I don't see the horrible person that everyone else is seeing. I see a good man that lost to his mental illness. Am I a bad person for mourning him and feeling bad for his family? Our community seems to think I am. I had always felt bad for the friends and families of the people who did these kinds of things, but I never thought I'd be one of them. And I sure as hell never thought it would feel this bad. 

(Sorry for the long post, I needed to get it off my chest as well as look for some advice)",13May2017,5
4,"I'm not looking for an official diagnosis or anything .. I need a little guidance as to what MAY be my problem. I don't have time to see a psychologist and I think I can solve this on my own but I want to know if there might be a clinical problem that describes my situation (eg pathological lying ... or just plain being an asshole). I had to really sit down and think about this, all this time I refuse to admit I have a problem and it's only possibly going to hurt my relations in the long run. The problem is that I don't REALLY admit there is anything wrong even when verbally I admit it sometimes. 

From a young age I've never ever felt bad for lying and making someone feel bad. I've had family members cry due to my lies and in reflection I get stressed when that happens because I don't like having to deal with the situation and I hate it when I get so much negative attention from people who hear what he/she thinks I did wrong. To be completely honest, I never can accept internally that I did something necessarily wrong, ignoring if I was ACTUALLY correct or not. Lying is double edged ... many times it helps you charm people into liking you and they don't even have any idea but sometimes when I don't have a sense of time or pre-planning to cover my lie someone like my parents will find out and I have to deal with them crying or something. I also have ADHD .... so even though I know I need to get working to cover a lie, for example, about a really high test score that never happened , it doesn't register and I don't feel the fear of consequence of my parents feeling bad. When I get bad grades from time to time (it used to be worse) I usually make a word document and type up a fake exam and then write on it and fake grade it with a red pen by faking different handwriting. It has been highly effective. Also when my parents don't believe me from time to time I fake an email from a teacher by sending a fake email to my address. I was lazy and decided to hold off creating a fake test until the last minute so I made an error which roused their suspicion and then they figured out I was lying. I still do it though.

I was a problem child in elementary school, but in middle school not so much because I took up interest in math and science so I was mostly satisfied so I didn't need to lie about grades. I lied about things to my friends and lost friendships as a result though. I have a clean record. For some things eg cheating on a test the risk of humiliation is higher than the reward. Besides it feels good to study by yourself and earn the grade.",13May2017,1

6,"As you can tell from the title, I'm having to home my mother who is very sick. Yes, physically sick. But most of that comes from the medications she's been taking for years. Medication that was supposed to help with her severe schizophrenia and bipolar. Medication that for awhile, did help. 

Until now. 

Well, not exactly until know. The ""decline"" has been happening for awhile now. It's been dragging on, excruciating to watch, but thankfully slow. Allowing me to find glimmering moments of my healthy mother. The woman that she is, the awesome woman that her sickness so unfortunately has overshadowed. My 42 year old mother can't tell me what day it is, she can't string together more than three sentences with the same topic and she thinks I'm a different one of her three children every four minutes. That's not even the worst of it all... 

She keeps running away. 

Add up not knowing the date, not being entirely coherent and running away. For three weeks I thought my mom was dead because she was just gone one day. Turns out, she had ran away from her apartment, got lost and ended up having a schizophrenic episode. Luckily, she was in the hospital. But living in another state entirely makes these things so much more difficult to actually handle. I'm unable to be there to look for her, or even look after her. 

I haven't started the process yet of putting her in one, because I want to make sure I find the best fit possible. But how do I know that is right? How do I know that she'll be well taken care of? Also, how do I begin to process that putting my mother in the home marks the thing I feared most, coming true. My entirely life I've been ravaged by the fear that one day, I'd look in my mothers eyes and the lights would kind of just be out. The beautiful, shining star that she is, would be trapped inside of her forever. Her brain taking total control over her, torturing her from the inside out. 

I'm just a 20 year old who could just use someone who kind of gets it. Even a little. I feel 100% alone. This isn't something I can casually talk to my friends about. It makes it harder because I know it's something they will never have to understand. Anyone out there hear me?

11,"For about 4 years now I've been in a period of heavy stress: I moved to a new state, got into a car accident, lived with an unstable roommate with lyme, started a new business, and also started drinking coffee.

Throughout all of this, I've been in a state of 'get from point A to point B', and working towards getting out of this rut (which I'm finally getting close to), and my job is in accounting, so I'm spending a lot of time analyzing and looking at things objectively.  I also feel like I'm always living for tomorrow, finding it hard to settle in the now.

As a result, I can feel that my brain has changed drastically.  My nervous system feels like it's always on, even if on a low volume, making it hard to physically relax.  Mentally it's hard to think of life as more than a list of things to do, or a box to check off once complete.  I feel like my emotions are dulled, as well as my physical senses, like how I don't experience cravings, but I still have an appetite.  It's also made it hard to relate to people and have an organic conversation that doesn't have a goal.

I used to be the goof ball of my group, working on creative ideas like screenplays, comics, etc, but now that person feels like a distant memory.  And speaking of memory, I feel like it's not as sharp because instead of reading something fully, I've trained my brain to find the answer as quickly as possible instead of reading to understand through context.

Has anybody experienced anything like this?  I've had an MRI and CAT scan recently and my brain is 'healthy', but I feel like the wiring has changed and I don't know if I can reverse it.

I hope somebody has some experiences with this and can shed some insight.",13May2017,4
13,"EDIT: It's worth mentioning that I am 19 now. 

I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety and major depression when I was 12/13 (Although my doctor suspects that I may have been misdiagnosed with MD instead of BPD so that may be changing). When I was first diagnosed with anxiety I was taken aback, depression wasn't a surprise as it runs in my family. I've noticed, especially in the past year, despite being on medication, that my anxiety has been rapidly increasing. My increase is anxiety has caused health problems, emotional instability (obviously), and the most troubling side affect, paranoia. 

Is it possible to get more anxious with age? Should I mention this to the psychiatrist when being re-evaluated? 

Thanks in advance!

14,"I know this isn't normal. I have odd, or unusual fears. I'm afraid of driving, vehicles, elevators, escalators, gas stations, other people, people online, and more. Every time I'm in a vehicle, I'm afraid of being in a car crash. This could be because when I was a little kid, my mom told me a story about when (before I was born) someone intentionally drove into her car, while both of my older sisters were in the vehicle. Also, my older sister has gotten into about 3 [car accidents](http://i.imgur.com/2HAsbFQ.jpg), one of which she had to be in a wheelchair in a while for. Also, I just don't trust other drivers anyways. I'm afraid of gas stations because, well, it's just an area with gallons upon gallons of extremely flammable liquid and vehicles. I'm afraid of elevators and escalators because you'd never know what could happen. I'd honestly just rather take the stairs. I'm afraid of other people (specifically men.) Don't get me wrong, I honestly have NOTHING against men, I just oddly feel strongly uncomfortable when a guy who I don't know talks to me. Also, I feel like anyone and everyone around me is either a rapist or a murderer. I'm afraid of people online for ""obvious"" reasons. There are creepers.

22,"My results on tests and exams throughout my primary school/high-school life are terrible, so I must be an idiot. Throughout high school (less so in primary school, because general oddness (thinking out loud a lot, intense and regular daydreaming, long periods where my mind would feel fuzzy and I couldn't think, absence epilepsy) made it seem like I was just a moron) my teachers said how bright I was and said how unexpected my results were. I'm not an idiot.

My mother (less so my dad, who's always believed in me and encouraged me to pursue a maths/science career) would regularly indirectly say what she thought about my intelligence (she believed I had a learning disorder) while I was at primary school (in high school she noticed my French results and decided it must have ""gone away""). She treated this with a in-school visits from a therapist of some sort, and tried to send me to [Rossbourne](http://www.rossbourne.vic.edu.au), which noticed I was intellectually normative during a trial period and rejected me (she responded by saying ""he's not that bad but he's not at *their* level either [where ""their"" refers to ordinary school students]. It's a shame their's so little space for kids who are ""in the middle"" like that"" and suggesting I repeat year 6). I know that she didn't really know what she was talking about, but I internalised her opinion nonetheless. I must be an idiot.

I'm currently following up on a passion for video game development by completing a programming degree at the AIE (http://www.aie.edu.au). The degree has entry requirements of a [VCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Certificate_of_Education) score of 20 (I had 23 iirc) in any maths and a 20 (I believe I had either a 21 or a 25) in english. These are very low. I must be an idiot.

During my interview I demonstrated a basic 2D game implemented in HTML5 canvas with a partial physics system; if I'd had the chance I would have demonstrated a home-made PHP blogging system/CMS that utilized my own home-built formatting language. I'm not an idiot.

I consistently get Distinctions (75%+) and High Distinctions (85%+) for ""essays"" (which don't follow essay format at all and are essentially practice papers) on topics such as complex lighting for games and comparisons between different software development methodologies. I'm not an idiot. Most of the class gets good marks and I suspect they're marked softly to balance out the way their academic nature compared to the highly creative work needed for other assignments (e.g. developing a rendering engine). Maybe I am an idiot.

I learnt about complex rotations and some basic calculus from [BetterExplained](https://betterexplained.com)) before my course started. I'm not an idiot. BetterExplained exists for people who don't ""get"" math or have issues learning from the school system. I'm an idiot.

I implemented a stack-based memory manager and a type-agnostic logger out of a textbook + SO over this year's summer holidays (Melbourne, Australia here). I'm not an idiot.

I also built an SSE-friendly maths library with quaternions (partly self taught) and matrix inversion (self taught). For a lot of complicated reasons, many of it's operations are broken and emit garbage or NaN results. I'm an idiot.

I have a knack for remembering the basics of lots of different things, and I can do arbitrary multiplications (up to three digits) in my head. I'm not an idiot.

My mother asks me whether I'm ""keeping up"" with the other students in my class whenever we're studying a maths topic. The last time we had a significant, multi-week maths class (last year; it was linear algebra + trigonometry and pythagoras' theorem) I understood everything and actually surpassed the class by researching the wedge product on my own, yet I failed the subject test (we have per-semester subjects, so it didn't affect the maths subject we do as part of physics simulation this year). I'm an idiot.

I'm currently revising the polygon-based rendering engine we built in our initial assignment this year to sample continuous scene information into a fixed-size voxel grid instead. I'm not an idiot.

My dad has said that I'm a highly divergent thinker and that my sister (excellent marks in everything) is highly convergent. Wikipedia tells me that these are basically swappable thinking modes and that convergent thought is strongly associated with cognition while divergent thought is associated with creativity; the implication is that divergent thinkers are less ""intelligent"" than convergent thinkers but more creative. I'm an idiot. 

I don't know where I am psychologically. I ***KNOW*** I'm not stupid, but my brain doesn't listen to the ""pro"" (""I'm not an idiot"") arguments and keeps falling into pits of anxiety over the ""cons"" (""I'm an idiot"").

I dont know what to do

my life is completely ruined because i cannot cope with the way I
look. If I am conscious then you can bet I am agonizing in my head about how I look. If I am asleep then I am likely dreaming about it or wake up sweating and angry when I remember who I am.


here is the crucial difference

my flaws are 100% legitimite, and they are simply not imagined. Unfortunately for me, it is not all in my head. I truly am  conventionally ugly. When I see myself in the mirror from the side I get an extreme rage, or when I see myself in the camera or pictures it can send me into multiple day long depressions. I was always considered ""ugly"", I want go into any specific details but it is my face. I was always the guy that would be made fun or said ""ewww"" about because of how I looked. Posting online for other comments also assured me that I was one ugly guy.



I know I will never be happy and its all because I got screwed over

I think average looking people ( let alone good looking) have absolutely NO clue how horrible life is for those like me.

I know I want to end it soon. I know I want to use a shotgun to the face to destory what ruined me and so that it never can be seen again. I know I want to be cremated and have no funerul and just be forgotten.

My last hope is spending all my money on plastic surgeries in the hope that they can make me normal. But the days that I await for consultations are long and agonizing.



I wish I did have BDD I truly do, when the flaws are real it makes it so much worst.

Moreover me and my mother have several fights and I cannot stand her in my life anymore because she refuses to stop lying to me. She lied to me my whole life about it and still does to this day. It makes it even worst.

I was assaulted after a night out. A stranger came into my house and verbally tried to get me to have sex with him, he then took off my skirt so I left my own house to get away from him. Whilst i was figuring out what to do on the street i was grabbed by another stranger who lead me down an alley and tried to sexually assault me. I felt his penis on my vagina but there was no actual 'sex'. The police found me and took me home and took my clothes. I was incredibly drunk and didn't remember what had happened until a few weeks afterwards. I self referred to the rape crisis centre and went for a counselling assessment with my ISVA. I was told to contact the police by my ISVA (independent sexual violence advisor) as I had remembered more details about what happened. During the police interview on friday I felt interrogated and uncomfortable, the DC kept referencing that I 'had been wandering the streets in my knickers' and when I explained this was because of unpleasant events in my house she just said that they might be 'false memories' and that 'maybe i'd just wandered off'. I was made to feel it was not a serious sexual assault and that because I was drunk that basically she didn't believe it was a stranger, she told me that 'it might have been someone you met in the club and gave the wrong impression and he's tried it on with you in the street' which i know is wrong.

Also: this is long. I'm sorry.

There seems to be a certain image of suicidal thoughts and plans. Depression, also. Self-harm. For some reason, self-harm and being suicidal are in the same category, for a lot of people. Sometimes, when I talk to people that have been suicidal in the past or even attempted suicide, they say that they only wanted help. Sometimes attention, even. Most of them have also self-harmed. They went to doctors/counselors/psychiatrists and were categorized as ""suicidal"". Or, they attempted and ended up in a hospital. Often, I hear people say ""well, of course I didn't really want to die, I actually wanted a better life"" or ""I really just not wanted the life I was having"".

For me, things seemed to be different. I genuinely wanted to die during the depressions I had. I felt like I was the most rotten piece of scum on earth that needed to be killed off to save the world and the people I loved. I made plans, detailed, good ones. It would not have been ""trying"" for me, if I would have come into action, I would be dead now. I never did any cutting or self-harm, neither did I have the urge to. I felt like I was dead already anyways, killing myself would be cleaning-up.

During a relationship I was in, I slipped into on of these bad depressions. At some point I admitted to my partner that I wanted to die. I'm very ashamed of this, as I should not have burdened that person with it, but I was convinced and desperate. We had (semi?-)rational discussions about it, I was told that it was not up to me to decide. 

Over the years, I have been in treatment at multiple points in time, they gave me a lot of different drugs, different diagnoses, too. There is a big flaw on my side: I do not communicate well with doctors. I have tried very hard, but they can't even seem to get straight on a diagnosis. Also, they just really do not seem interested. They don't dig. I'm not blaming them only, I'm blaming myself, too.

Still, looking back at the past episodes and how things were handled makes me mad. I don't think I was ever really considered suicidal. I slipped through the system in that way, as probably many people do. Still, and this might be a touchy thing to say, I feel like I have been closer to dying than some people that actually attempted suicide. I needed better help. Yes, I am alive, but that is more due to luck than anything else. Also, I lost a lot of time and my brain got fucked up badly.

Even that partner I had back than, the one I told about how I felt - a while after we broke up I asked why he never informed someone about what was going on/got help. Why didn't he take me to a doctor, or at least call my parents. It was not a short-term thing, I had been a huge, on-the-brink-of-psychotic mess for a good while. The explanation was: ""if you would have started going crazy with knives or something, I would have called for help, of course"". He didn't get it.

And that is exactly the problem. The doctors and counselors I've seen are the same way. You do not get taken seriously unless you go into action. To emphasize how suicidal somebody is, I often hear people say ""yeah.. he/she even self-harms!"", or, ""attempted 2 times already!"". Unless you go into action, the thoughts and plans can be categorized as ""idealization"". ""Thoughts of flight"". ""Fantasy"". 

We're slipping through.


**Addition/Edit:** I reread and want to add that I'm absolutely NOT saying that anybody should go into action to get help or that that is the only way to get help.",13May2017,0
44,"So back story, I've dealt with depression on and off for years. I've felt pretty good recently, almost happy. But many nights I still find myself wondering, why bother with life.
I mean, I work in healthcare and make a difference to so many patients every day. but I just don't see the point in continuing this miserable existence. I turned it all around a year ago and lost a lot of weight, started lifting, dated my best friend which subsequently ended. Im dating now but a) I worry incessantly I'm going to fuck it up and normally fuck it up through self induced worry b) get too involved too quick and scare any ladies away.

I also can't make friends, like i have plenty of female friends but no guys to just chill and play xbox with. Theres nothing more lonely than spending a weekend alone, wishing you had a real friend to chill and drink beer with. 

I dont even know why I'm posting, I guess I just need someone to read this. The thought of ending it is always at the back of my mind, like if xyz went wrong theres always that, it sort of gives me enough peace to get to sleep. 

I mean, at mid 20's you'd kind of expect someone to have their shit almost together. If the first 25 years have been like this, the next 25+ look pretty bleak. Why continue? What could I possibly achieve in that time thats actually going to make me happy, without ruining someone else's life along the way",13May2017,2
46,"I genuinely ask this question to myself from time to time.

**How twisted my mind is?**

I swear, my thoughts are what I think my worst enemy. I'm scared of many things, from death, having an accident to losing my girlfriend etc. Let me clear this up: I'm young, 21, and I know I barely got any experience but I need to get this out of my chest.
Everyday, I feel like once I'll be dead there won't be anything more for me, I'll lose what I gathered in my life until now, my parents, the people that I mostly care about, all the little things I achieved etc. This doesn't happen very often, but there are times when these crappy thoughts come to life and they won't give me an easy hour;
also, this happens mostly during night when I'm alone and my mind is free to think whatever it wants! 

For example, today I was talking with my girlfriend, she's 20 and she says that in her future she'd love to have kids, there isn't anything wrong in this but the thing is that she said ""Someone might give me beautiful kids in the future"" which brought me to thinking ""so you're believing in this relationship until the end or is this something temporary for you?"" and her answer (logically) was ""well I don't know, I can't be sure but you sure are sweet""

Of course no one knows what the future expect for them but am I the only one hoping to get far in his early relationship? I don't wanna dig anymore this topic since this is /r/mentalhealth but you get my point, I'm scared of losing her, scared to the point I'm afraid to not enjoy what i'm living right now.

Everyday when I'm driving I feel like I might get an impulse to derail myself from the road or something like that, but of course this is something that **ONLY RESIDES IN MY MIND** and doesn't ever get out. I feel like I cannot talk of this to anyone, like anyone would ever understand my point.

I'm sorry for this long post and I hope somebody can understand me.",13May2017,2
