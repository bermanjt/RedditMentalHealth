1,"My girlfriend is in a fucking ward from hell it's almost as bad as movie depictions. They have her in a FUCKING ISO ROOM. She isn't even supposed to be in iso they're too fucking lazy to fix it. I'm going to be real she's borderline and I'm biopolar, she's my whole world and we help each other and understand each other. She freaked out and cut herself, IT HAPPENS. She was barely suicidal if even man. She was just looping and confused. Her mom is a bitch and got her committed. Anyway they have her so drugged up it's horrifying. I was talking to her today and she was like ""what I'm sorry I can't focus right now for some reason"" and just smiled at me real slow. She told me she has only seen someone to talk to once and that was right before court. This place has 1.5 stars on Google guys. And she was like the nurses keep snapping at me and I get confused and sad and she started crying. She's smart guys this is surreal this is downright villainous. I need to do something but I don't know where to start please guys I'm begging you give me advice please. She told me they aren't helping her at all and she feels like she's in prison. And I believe it all my experiences with staff have been worse than horrible. What do I guys please???",06Jun2017,1,
2,"In 2014, I started taking several meds to manage bipolar depression and ADHD. I was started on 20mg adderall two times a day, latuda 40 mg once a day and cymbalta 30 mg (I think). I felt a huge difference in my attitude within about two weeks of starting all the meds, but my insomnia seemed to get worse. The doctor added 200mg of seroquel once at night about an hour before bed. It worked great at first, but every few months we had to up the dose until I was taking 800mg every night. In this time, I gained nearly 30 lbs. I'm not small to begin with, but that's a pretty big amount of weight. I just recently got back on my adderall, but am not taking the latuda and cymbalta as I want to see how I do without it. He did put me back on the seroquel for now though, until I see the primary care doctor he recommended so I can start Ambien, which I have taken in the past. He said the primary care doctor might try to keep me on the seroquel. I'm just wondering if the weight gain from the seroquel is worth it. I lost the weight over the last six months I've been off my meds (due to insurance issues). I just really don't want to get any bigger than I already am, but when I don't take it I can stay up literally for three or four days at a time before I crash. Any suggestions on something else I can try if the doctor doesn't want to do Ambien?",06Jun2017,1,

6,"I finally finished my graduate education and moved back to living with my family for a few weeks before starting my job. After living for about 2-3 weeks at home, I realize that I no longer feel like I'm hostage to poor eating habits - grazing 'round the clock, eating smaller meals/snacks after I've already finished my main meal, eating when I'm not actually hungry. Meal times are now focused on conversations about how I and my family members are doing, current events, stuff like that. It's not just me and a box of cereal and my phone/reddit in a dank one-bedroom apartment. I eat without dietary restrictions, normal portions, and it has just been... entirely different. I eat when I'm hungry (including snacking) and don't have a restrictive mindset. I'm slowly getting back to my baseline weight (not much, but I'm short so even a few pounds does make a difference). I realize that I don't feel lonely when I'm living at home, and it is reflected a great deal in my eating habits. 

I will move out again to another city to start work, and I'm anxious that I'll have to eat alone again. Do you have any suggestions for me? Thoughts? ",06Jun2017,2,

11,"The long and the short of it:

My younger brother (25) has a long history of maladaptive behavior including threats of self harm, threats of physical violence, actual physical violence, explosive rage, severe OCD, and has been diagnosed as on the autistic spectrum (in the realm of what was formally called aspergers). Over the past few years he has deteriorated severely - more frequent threats of physical violence, and more and more antisocial behavior. He can't hold a job and has recently graduated to stalking behavior (he harassed a girl via text, kept showing up at her work, and tried to get her fired when she rejected him). He's convicted relationship was ""going somewhere"" and blames my sister for ""turning [this girl] against him."" The reality is the girl was my sister's friend and she was terrified that he wouldn't listening to her  requests to back off, so my sister tossed him to leave her alone. 

I've had this unsettling feeling for a while. My parents (my brother lives with them) live in fear of my brother, but won't throw him out. My brother refuses psychological help. My sisters and I are afraid of him, and he's threatened physical violence/made very dark, ambiguous threats in the past. His behavior is definitely escalating, but the local magistrate says we can't have him involuntary committed. 

What are the warning signs someone is going to freak out and murder their family? I'm terrified I'm going to wake up to the news that my brother murdered my parents, my sister, and then himself.

12,"Hello and good evening reddit this is a throwaway account since I don't want to chance the trust my friend has put in me over the past year by telling me whats wrong. 


I'll be referring to her as Alice through the post so bear with me.


Now Alice is currently is still underage, without health insurance, and with a horrible family background.


From what I could gather she has depression, some possible personality issues, has self harm history, and really bad trauma from molestation/rape when she was younger. Not to mention her mother is very very good at making her feel worthless, and truly only shows signs of caring for her when it seems convenient for her.


So honestly mental shes a ticking time bomb, and I'm at my wits end since I know me talking to her is only going to so much I dont have a PHD in this.


I'm looking for any and all resources to her help in Colorado US. and possibly keep her till she can begin making a life of her own away from her direct family. If the latter isn't possible just some way she can get treatment whether it be through medicine or therapy. All I know is she needs help and won't make it much longer without direct help.

14,"Background: 15f with **gad**, **panic disorder**, possible (aka definite) social anxiety, possible ocd, **depression**, PTSD from 2 major traumatic events in my life, overall just really fucked up. (If in **bold** I'm on medication for it)

I'm not gonna go into too much detail here unless people have questions but basically the past 3 years have been very difficult. I was bullied throughout all of middle school and then I also saw my friend being raped in front of me. My therapists and psychiatrist are all amazing women who have helped me through a lot but I think I need more, I'm just afraid to ask for it.

I started my meds in March of this year for the above issues, and for a while they were working great. I also left school and started homeschooling around the same time because my friend's rapist goes to my school and I would end up having full blown panic attacks any time I thought I saw him (didn't help that he had bright blue hair lol). So everything was fine and dandy until about two weeks ago. Again I'm not going to go into much detail, but the rapist's parents don't believe he did anything and have been trying to scare me and my friend out of saying anything to a judge without them knowing first (so that they can say we're lying about it, it's odd I know). So, they had a friend (who happened to be an investigative attorney) of their's knock on my door while I was home alone and say that I had to go to his law offices and have an interview which him, which is a) false and b) completely inappropriate considering I am a minor who has been through emotional trauma and because of which, has left school (which his family is obviously aware of).

Since then it's like my meds don't work anymore. I'm in bed most of the day and barely move or speak to anyone really. On top of that I'm really lonely because people are in school all day and I'm home completely by myself. I was very close with my mom but I just can't seem to connect with her like I used to. My mind is always racing and yet I do nothing all day but sleep, eat, and comment on people's posts on reddit. I don't know what happened (it just seems like that man who knocked on my door flipped a switch and now I'm slowly deteriorating back to how I used to be) and I don't know what to do (my next therapy appointments aren't until august and I'm going to be out of time for half of June and all of July)

I've been depressed for a significant amount of my life, so I understand that how I'm behaving is typical for me, but inside I feel like I've reached this new level and I don't know why or how. 

Anyways, if anyone has any advice or words of motivation that'd be great.

20,"First of all I'm 15 so I'm not the wisest and I'm not depressed either, although I have been in the past I just randomly snapped out of it so I guess I wasn't really depressed but it was since I was eight until fourteenish. Anyways, since I was very young I was uncomfortable with my appearance a great deal, and I know this sound really shallow but I was constantly bullied by other girls until maybe sixth grade (they made a list of 20 things I should change about myself if I wanted to be loved). Once it all went away I was stuck with other things I hated about myself, I was also made fun of about my intelligence by almost everyone I've met who happened to be in my age range. Teachers always made sure to tell me I was intelligent but my peers and friends always told me all this shit and I believe it to this day, and I have good reason to. When I was thirteen my school made me take an iq test to make sure there wasn't anything wrong since in elementary school I didn't do anything. It came back average (110) and I can't stop worrying about how average it is, I eat lots of stuff high in omega 3, read, try doing math in my head, and do mind puzzles online. It's become my new obsession, I used to have an obsession with my physical appearance and now it's my intelligence because I just can't accept myself and I feel it's due to others not being able to accept me and having to constantly shit on me for whatever reason. I never do anything to provoke it too. I always act really happy all the time because I'm lonely and yearn for any sort of social interaction. This girl who claims to be my friend used to always call me stupid for no reason in front of our group of friends normally I would ignore it but that day I said ""you say you're stupid all the time, why are you looking at me"" she responded with ""at least I know I am. . ."" And trailed off. It hurt so bad, I hate people my age. I could stand so few, that same girl constantly posts on Snapchat about how she's getting better from her depression and anxiety, if you have problems like that and it hurts you why would you want to inflict the same pain onto someone else and someone you consider your friend? I think about my intelligence everyday I always found everyone to be superior to me mentally and that I'll never be capable of doing anything with myself because I lack the smarts. 
Other stuff bothers me, I find romantic relationships or friendships not to be pointless but just weird. You'll never truly know a person, they're constantly Changing. You don't know you well enough to answer the most simple question right after it's asked ""what do you like better, NY or Boston"" assuming you've been to both. The whole point of a relationship is to make us happy but those people are going to leave one day and the only thing you'll have are the memories and pictures. And that's going to end up making you feel worse despite what that famous quote says ""better to have loved than never have loved at all"" I don't think I'll ever have or had a friendship where I wasn't fearing they'll leave me or replace me. And once they're gone, I don't think I'll be ""ah, I was happy that happened"" I think it would be more on the lines of ""they're gone now, you'll never meet another person like that."" And I'll just cry whenever I think of them. 

I have a problem involving my mom, she passed away when I was 13 and when she fist passed I started having social anxieties, I was shy as a child but when she passed I now have problems being in front of people and other things like that, I feel like I was using her as protection and now I'm just expected to be independent because I no longer have a motherly figure to take care of me. I got used to it though so that's good, self improvement can't hurt. I always have this growing fear that she's somewhere watching me and she hates me now. My mom had schizophrenia and didn't get help for it, she had extreme anger over things. She thought ppl wanted to kill her in various ways that were ridiculous and extreme. She was a bit judgmental and could be very mean sometimes, don't get me wrong she only cares for her kids. But she had a lack of empathy so she'd say really harsh things and not care. She wasn't a monster though, not at all but sometimes I think it was due to her mental condition. 
This whole thing is just a rant, I don't think I explained my views well enough though, it's just confusing and I worry a lot to top it off, ever since i was little even in the summer I'd be worried about absolutely nothing, I'd find things to worry about and worry about how I'm not worried and how it might mean something went wrong in my brain of some sort. I have a fear of getting infected with a super bug or any disease. But yeah, that's me! Oh well. I think I'm normal, and being normal is really all that matters in our society.

I can tell I've been high and I'm about to go low.  In the past couple weeks I've been feeling that cold hand coaxing me to lay on the floor and the weights on my brow.  No apparent reason.... But I seem to swing back and forth.  

Last time, years ago, was the worst.  I almost killed myself, and life was unfathomably dull and had a kind of melancholy agony to it.  I knew I'd be back there eventually, and now I know it's coming.  Some dark thoughts have been popping up again lately, and I've been mildly 'down' for more days than not in the past month.

36,"Hi there, 

I'm a 24 year old Canadian woman, I work in a pet salon and I love my job. 
I've always struggled with depression, but recently (last 5 months or so) I've started to get this on again/off again pull between wanting to kill myself without anything seeming to trigger my depression or a meltdown, and being stupidly happy. 

My first thought is bipolar. 
I almost never get angry - it just seems to be only happy or miserable/suicidal. Never anywhere in between and it's havoc to my daily life. I call in sick more than I should, I can't function.

I was on a high dose of Wellbutrin XL for a little while, to help with the depression while I was transitioning through a rough patch in life. 

I just want an outside opinion while I await my doctors appointment next week.

My apologies for the formatting and it being all over the place... I'm not entirely sure how to talk about this properly. 

Thanks. ",06Jun2017,9,
37,"Let's see... Here's some quick background:

Me: 34, male, ""in a relationship"", 4 kids ( 2 bio, 2 previous marriage ) and ADHD ( at least that's been the popular diagnosis ). On Vyvanse, Viibryd, smoke marijuana frequently. Work 60 hour weeks, oncall 24x7. 

Problem: Past year, year and a half, I've been really battling with depression ( sort of ongoing since I had my kids ) and since the beginning of the year, it's gotten much much worse than I can ever remember. Sometime last year, I began to notice that my ""internal monologue"", ya know, the sound of your thoughts in your voice in your head, started to change. 

When I'm depressed I usually spend quite a bit of time hating on myself internally. Basically I bully myself in my head. Call myself names, ignore good things I've done, hyper-focus on anything that remotely resembles rejection or failure. Seemingly typical stuff for a depressed person. So that has gradually gotten worse, more vicious, becoming a constant ""presence"" in my mind. 

At the beginning of the year I was placed on a non-voluntary psychiatric hold for 72 hours because I completely snapped from stress, lack of sleep, my autistic toddlers, relationship problems, etc. Around that time is when I really noticed how my internal monologue had sort of switched gears. It no longer sounded like my voice or thoughts, but like an unknown 3rd party. 

The past few months, the stream of thoughts started to turn into a voice or more accurately a group of voices that I can only describe as ""Legion-esque"". It's young, old, men, women talking at once, as a single voice. I don't hear it in my ears, but I hear it in my head. 

Some other things that seems to occur during these periods where this negative voice is in full swing are stuff like complete and udder shutdown of socializing, bathing, caring and my memory. I know I'm a pothead but I just lost like 3 weeks of time that I have no idea where it went. I don't remember anything that happened at all, like an alcoholic blackout. I just stayed in our bedroom and ignored everyone else around me. 

I have no clue what the hell is going on anymore. I'm having a hard time trusting myself and believing what I'm seeing, experiencing and how I'm interpreting it is all correct or real. Not to the degree of mistaking children for ducks or talking to a disconnected phone, but I can't seem to find a good grasp on reality anymore. It's extremely hard to tell if I'm read context and social clues correctly or if I'm just being a lazy bastard or if it's all a batshit nightmare. My bigger concern is the drastic increase of symptoms I've never experienced or only recently started to.

I'm just really here to see if this is something that anyone else can relate to at all. I don't really have too many people to talk to about this stuff because I've managed to burn every bridge with family and friends with my anti-social behaviors. I'm not looking for a diagnosis or reaffirmation that I'm experiencing something like Major Depressive Disorder with Psychosis ( or even schizophrenia, but it sorta sounds like one of those ). I do have a doctor's appointment in two weeks, so I'm not just spinning my wheels either. 

I find all this absolutely terrifying and it's so hard to discuss with my partner, as she just can't conceptualize this stuff and she gets really upset when I ""let the voice speak"" and go on a tirade. She did note when I'm ranting and raving, it seems like I'm stuck in some sort of logic loop, bitching about stuff in circles.

40,"I was seeing a psychologist for therapy(originally for social anxiety but we discussed other issues related to my self image as well) through my school where the fee is heavily subsidized. I just had my last therapy session with her today. She was great. Warm, empathetic, intelligent, perceptive, everything I would want in a therapist are all ways I could characterize her. I'm pretty sure I was experiencing transference(I might say that my strong feelings were a reflection of her character and personality but then so would a lot of people that experience transference). Im also pretty sure she picked up on it even though I never had the courage to bring it up, as she had the ability to read me like a book. Anyway her time at the university ended and she is moving to an outside practice, where it wouldnt be subsidized. Today was our last session. In previous sessions she basically said I had the option of being put on the waiting list for a new therapist or she hinted at me following her to her new location. However I got the sense that she thought the first option would be better as the second one would be much more expensive. So I told her to put me on the waiting list. Now I am having second thoughts for various reasons and I am not sure what to do. Some good reasons, some not so good reasons.

We said our goodbyes today. She gave a very touching reflection of our time together and how she was glad to meet me and that I opened up to her, and like an idiot I basically just said something thoughtless like ""I feel the same way"". It also seemed like she may have been getting emotional, and I downplayed the emotion I was feeling. Thats a pretty big regret. It all just happened so fast, I didnt know what to do. I just hope she realizes how much her therapy meant to me and how great I think she is. I kinda want to at least ask her how much more it would cost if i followed her, if only so she would know that I still want to continue with her. She is also a great therapist and who knows how the next therapist I get paired up with will be. There is also the issue of starting over with a new person. Opening up is not easy for me.

On the other hand, I'd be lying if I said that my fondness for her isnt playing a role in this dilemma. And from a therapeutic stand point maybe it is best if I see a new therapist, one that I am not attached to.

Sorry for the somewhat incoherent stream of consciousness. At least venting in this way was therapeutic in itself even if I dont get any replies.

The vibe I get from people around me is that mental health problems don't exist besides psychopaths who want to murder everyone they see, and if your problem isn't that, then you should just deal with it yourself. This makes it hard to tell if I do have a mental health problem or I'm just a bit pathetic and weak. I have however take nseveral online mental haelth assessments, and usually I get low scores for all the conditions. besides depression, anxiety and autism. I usually get VERY high scores on those ones. This has led to me believing that I have anxiety at least, because some of the symptoms of depression and autism are similar, and anxiety always scores highest. The tests always say ""you should seek medical attention for this as soon as possible, but do not take this as a diagnosis."" when I score highly for a condition.

57,"Hi all. I have some sort of psychological paralysis. I have zero motivation to do anything. I am wondering where a good place to start would be? I go to my family doctor for ADHD, should I try that for depression too? I have tried so hard to see a psychologist, but none are  ever taking new patients. I can't get out of bed. What's a good first step? ",06Jun2017,1,
