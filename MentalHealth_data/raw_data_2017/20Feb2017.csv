4,"I really don't know what to do about this. Can anyone offer any advice please? It's becoming incredibly hard to to deal with. I mean I already have depression and have medication for it, and often get suicidal thoughts, but it always happens specifically then. I haven't had the feelings in a week or so, and then the very second it happens I feel like just giving up on life and killing myself. fuck biology.",20Feb2017,0
9,"I'm officially going through a psychiatric screening starting in march. Until then I'm taking a break from school as per recommendation after I talked to my student-counselor about feeling depressed lately. I have tremendous social anxiety. The shortest way I can describe why that is, is that something has always felt... *weird*, or off-putting, when I stand directly in front of other people and talk to them. I think it's called derealization but it always happens and I never quite feel like being there ever felt natural. It makes me say things that make people raise their eyebrows or make shifty looks at me when they think I'm not paying attention. It has meant i was bullied a lot in primary school because people thought I was annoying for being myself (I was thrown around and humiliated because I wouldn't react or engage them). I tried really hard in high school and for around a year or two I felt good about myself. I have fond memories of a handful of parties I attended where I felt like I was being myself and some people found me interesting enough that we'd talk and hang out in a pub. It seems like magic now. I don't know who was inside me then when I think about who's inside me now. It's like two different people, and I can't for the life of me act socially responsible or appropriate for my current age of 23 years. 

I think it's the realization that I probably fit the autism label that has caused me to... regress. I have signs. I can't deny it. Despite having a good year or two every relationship eventually fell into shambles again. Many of those wonderful people that I'm still friends with on FB and Instagram go around maturing and living their own lives and have probably well forgotten me by now, because I wasn't socially capable to make them friends for longer than half a year before the signs of my true self creeped in and weirded them out. The most recent memory I have of this was an event with my school where we had to stay with strangers from other campuses for 3 days in a hut, I was with two foreign girls my age and I tried my best to seem outgoing but eventually it hit a wall when I tried to make a joke but something really weird came out that made the whole thing feel awkward and the rest of the time we couldn't speak to each other anymore becuase they could feel there was something in the air about me and gave weird looks.

I think the signs of autism, mild autism, that I have, and especially being aware of it, has decreased my self-esteem more than it ever could've to be blissfully unaware. I stink in my degrees. I stay home all my free time being ""locked"" in place in front of a computer, going back between the same 5 pages. Play a video game for 2 hours and feel displeasure at how much I'm going through the motions because I can't just move myself out of my apartment. I must be super depressed and it's because I'm aware of my symptoms that have halted me from maturing since that wonderful time now 6 years ago when I actually felt like life was moving forward.

I just hit every possible roadblock, and I had it coming all that time, I just had a really good year when I felt I was overcoming my problems but then when things went bad again, I realized my pervasive issues are due to signs of autism and it... fucking, depresses me so much I want time to stop so I can overcome being frozen and return to life as it was 6 years ago and continue instead of developing mental health issues like anxiety.",20Feb2017,6
10,"Thanks for reading. 

I just moved to Chicago 2 weeks ago. I quit my job in South Carolina to come here and seek out better opportunities for comedy and screenwriting. 

I'm not handling it well. 

I decided to come here instead of LA because I knew a couple of people here and none there. Since being here, my main friend hasn't hung out with me very much and another one hasn't at all. I'm single and I don't have a very understanding family. 

I have no one to talk to and I'm really lonely. I had hoped to go out to comedy clubs and start meeting people, but I'm so afraid of social interaction. I'm from a small town and the bigness of the city intimidates me as well. I'm always so worried that I'm doing something incorrectly or I'm bothering someone or in their way. 

I want to ask my friend to hang out with me more but he's married and I always feel like I'm bothering if I ask. 

I tried to prepare myself before I moved. Tried to keep myself from thinking that as soon as I got out of a small town, everything would be better. That preparation has helped some, but not enough. 

Any advice is appreciated. ",20Feb2017,1
11,"My friend,  20 years old, has eating disorder habits like Binge eating and also has a ton of pics of really disgustingly skinny girls on her phone, and she also has extreme mood swings and anxiety all the time. She always blames and hates herself for things that aren't her fault, and it's affecting her and the people around her including myself. Whenever she expressed these things to her parents, they just tell her she's being weak and just to be stronger. They are so ignorant and her mom doesn't even believe in vaccines. They have my friends insurance card and are withholding it so my friend cannot see the university mental health center. What are her options? We are in US btw. ",20Feb2017,3
12,Does anyone else with experience in psych wards think that this movie is trying to create an asylum-like setting for a horror movie? Does anyone else with bad experience as a patient in a psych ward (especially an involuntary admit) get bad memories from the trailer?,20Feb2017,1
16,"This shit bothers me so much. I cant even consider meds for my issue due to massive fears over acquiring something like PSSD. I understand its rare but to me the risk is totally not worth it. And there really dont seem to be a good set of medications for anxiety and depression that don't have this stuff.

My doctor is also not able to find a good medicine for me. I am not willing to take anything that has a risk of sexual sides/PSSD. I know theres Wellbutrin but I also have the tinnitus condition and I've heard of tinnitus sufferers also having that aggravated or even triggered by it so thats also a no go unfortunately. 

Then theres Mirtazapine, which I actually tried recently but it knocked me out and made me totally nonfunctional the next day from a powerful sedative antihistamine effect. It was the lowest dose of 15 mg too and I tried for 3 days and those were 3 days where I literally had trouble getting out of bed (which is not one of my usual symptoms). 


Therapy seriously isn't working and I am getting desperate enough to have to consider medication but no way will I swallow a pill that can cause permanent sexual dysfunction, no matter how rare it is. Even if its my anxiety making me blow that up I don't want to take any risks with my body particularly in a domain that is so integral to a healthy life. My problem was drug induced and I am incredibly sensitive to medicines as well also which makes any of the SSRI interventions in particular a far greater risk.

Whats the hold up for the pharma industry in creating meds for mental health which don't come with such nasty side effects?? The SSRIs are old as hell--why hasn't anybody come up with anything and brought it into the market since? It almost seems like SSRIs are the stone age of psychiatry and we are still in it despite all the research? Based on wikipedia it seems most were made in the 90s which is a really really long time ago. 

Does no company understand that a healthy sex life is important to depression/anxiety sufferers? Of all people why give depression/anxiety patients one more thing to be depressed or anxious about aka their sex life",20Feb2017,30

19,"Hey guys,

thanks for helping me. I've started to write a lot on this subreddit and all your answers are helpful and I truly appreciate it.

I've been in a relationship for 2 years before my ex (19F) broke up with me recently because I was making her feel like shit.

Our relationship was really healthy before we started to argue with some stuff. When she was telling me that I did something wrong, I automatically took it like a personal attack from her and started to tell some stuff that I never ever thought about her. NEVER. I was saying what I did for her but unconsciously was making her feel guilty. I never made something for having a ''grip'' on her, but more because I wanted to make her smile and make her happy because I love her.

She left me because someone else was making her feel great and she could talk to him without any problem, giving her what I couldn't. But she still strongly care about me and she still have this feel of ''nostalgia and memories'' when she sleeps with my t-shirt (she still have it and still sleep with it).

I think this feeling of ''I don't have any problems'' is in fact due to my childhood. My dad is someone who never apologize because ''he never did something wrong''. He has a lot of money problem and he always made me feel guilty if I didn't gave him anything. My mom was always telling me that my dad was always saying the truth and that way, it was making me guilt tripping. What I did to her was exactly what my dad was doing to me, making me feel ''guilty about something I didn't do''.

I also think that it does have some links with my childhood at school. I was always someone who got hurt by others for no reasons and I've been in depression for that. I always thought that I did something wrong and I've been in depression for that. I never thought that I was a great person since then.

I've recently cut ties with my dad, decided that enough was enough and in order to be fully aware of what I was doing, I needed to set things straight with him. I already felt better about myself and I have a lot more of self confidence.

I had a lot of great flashback with my ex. We went to London together for our 7th month. We met each other on a MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) by an extremely small chance. It immediately ''clicked'' between me and her. I feel so bad about what I've done to her, because she does feel bad for nothing she did but also because I know what I did was wrong. I know it could be too late but I want her to give me a chance and I want to work on myself for not hurting anyone else that I love and care so much.

Me and her will see each other this week, she wants to give me a chance to show her who I'm truly am and the works I've done on myself. Last time we saw each other, we both cried and she told me that she loves me. She doesn't want me away and wants to keep my t-shirt because she wants something of me and she wants me to keep her pyj because I don't want her away from me.

**tl;dr:** My girlfriend broke up because I wasn't making her feel great sometimes because I was making her ''guilt triping'' about something she didn't do. My dad I've always been like that and I cut ties with him. She still strongly care about me and so do I. I want to make her feel great about herself and now that I know everything I've done is wrong, I need some advice. We plans to see each other this week. Do you have any advices?

20,"Hey so basically I was suspecting that I had ADHD for quite a long time now and finally had my psychiatrist appointment today, we chatted and she ended up prescribing me 3 medications, she didn't even tell me if I had ADHD or not (should have asked, fuck).
She prescribed me vortioxetine, Aripiprazole and Bromazepam.
I was reading about this medication and apperantly its for depression(which i do have and we did talk about it with the psychiatrist) She told me she was gonna put me off most of the medication after a few months. But my question is is someone taking anything similar? Is this gonna help me with my concentration problems?

* We're interviewing men to get a better understanding of what you think depression is and what it's like to talk to a doctor about it. Understanding your perspective will be extremely valuable for filling a gap in research on men's experiences of depression.

* As compensation for your time and effort in participating in two short interviews, you'll be given $20. The study is recruiting men aged 18 or older who would be willing to spend 30-40 minutes talking with a researcher about these topics. 
* We ask that you contact us as soon as possible--no longer than three weeks after you were first told by a doctor or other professional that you might be depressed. 

* The interview will be conducted by phone or in-person for residents of Central Massachusetts or the Greater Boston Area. We will also call you six months after we interview you to check in and do another brief 10-20 minute interview. 

* You'll be asked a series of questions, and you may decline any question that you do not want to answer. If you wish to stop participating in the study at any time, you are free to do so. Your answers will be kept fully confidential.

25,"I posted this to a few subreds a few days ago and just hoping for more opinions.

""Hello, I'm Eddie. I am currently going through depression and schizophrenia. I do need some advice on how to cope with things.

I have tried opening up to my family and friends about what I am going through. Even to my doctors. But it hasn't gone well for me at all. I was tricked and locked up in the mental hospital and another incident when I was suicidal and had to be taken in by the police. So my sense of trust have been pretty much destroyed and I am looking for anyone who could give me advice.

Daily life is becoming a chore. I can't stop the noises in my head and have lost total control on multiple times. I need things to keep me occupied and to keep my mind off everything and yet I can't stay focused. Just like at this moment, when I have an exam paper in a few hours. I can't concentrate and I feel my mind crumbling inside.

Does anyone have any advice on what I should do? I can't turn back to my doctors/family/friends as I do not want to be locked up again. I'm scared of the mental hospital and the holding cells.""",20Feb2017,1

30,"I've researched enmeshment, narcissistic mothers, and the jocasta complex and a lot of the resources detail mothers burdening their *young* sons with personal problems.

I'm looking for articles, books, etc. that detail/address mothers enmeshing *adult* sons and sharing their relationship problems with their sons (For example, asking her adult son whether she should leave her long-time partner, discussing money issues, etc). 

This problem has led to the adult son feeling guilty if he doesn't provide advice and isn't ""there"" for this mother emotionally. He is inclined to accept all of her frequent requests to spend time together, primarily because she is unhappy in her relationship. The adult son is guilted into thinking he is responsible for his mother's happiness.

31,"So I keep having dreams in which I am schizophrenic/have severe mental illness and it's pretty concerning! It's happened probably 4/5 times in the last 2 weeks (that I can remember). The dreams are always different, but what remains the same is that I display severe delusions/psychosis and the dreams are VERY vivid.

One dream I remember most clearly I think I am a Jedi, I walk through this apartment block (really poor/impoverished area) killing all the sith with swords (all the smiths have lightsabers). I literally, in this dream, chop the 'Siths' up, its brutal! Then towards the end of the dream I begin to feel odd, I look down and all the people I've killed are unarmed, 'normal' looking people. One of my friends appears and tells me I've just killed 5 people. I suddenly realise what I've done (killed 5 innocent people) at which point I woke up quickly. 

Additionally, I sometimes find when I'm drifting off I start to dream when I'm half asleep (?) and can't tell if I'm drifting off to sleep or if the dream is real! 

For reference, I have been concerned about my mental health recently, my mood is very up and down, as are my motivation levels. When they're high they are very high, then they drop quite a bit. I use cannabis once/twice a week, and MDMA once every few months (although I went overboard with mdma at a festival last summer and had a psychotic symptoms for 5/6 hours).

I'm just concerned the dreams could mean something/don't know what to do/who to talk to. Any advice would be very gratefully received! X",20Feb2017,2
