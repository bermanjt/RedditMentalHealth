0,I have had a strange confusing life. I've never felt 100% upstairs I doesn't help I was constantly called weird in school. The last two years I have felt up and down and began to believe that I had BPD. I now realise that I only hate myself and I'm perfectly in control of my emotions and that I just liked feeling sorry for myself. I'm doing therapy now and I feel embarrassed to have taken it so far. ,15Nov2017,12,

Like I went to McDonalds and I was feeling so fucking anxious trying to decide what to order?? I've told my doctor  and they said ""Its just highschool stress"" and idk he kinda made me feel like everything I said is invalid??? Help please I guess?",15Nov2017,1,

3,I've recently been prescribed these two meds. Abilify daily and klonopin as needed for anxiety and panic attacks. It's been making me ridiculously tired. What can I do to combat this? ,15Nov2017,2,
4,"Doing the meds management for a while, and making progress, but not there yet and looking for things to fill my day, and to distract me from anxiety and depression, at least for a while. I love to organize things, but that's left me with...a completely organized apartment. So that's out. 

I've been watching movies and TV, playing online games, going for walks with my dog, reading lots of books. The more creative stuff is hard, but for a couple days now I've watched nature documentaries while making a lanyard bracelet.

What's your go-to distraction?",15Nov2017,6,
5,"I am a 20 year old homosexual male and I have recurring thoughts and feelings if you will.

I've never been in a relationship before, and I've been really wanting to have one. Badly. I've got a problem with this, because when I see a man I find attractive, I always get a mix of unpleasant feelings, including wishing I could get to know him and eventually be with him, jealousy and feeling self conscious about myself. It makes me feel really bad about myself, like I'm worthless and not good enough, and the really bad part is that it makes me have feelings of self harm, though I've never actually self harmed any more than occasionally neglecting my needs or intentionally bruising myself. I think that stems from my complete lack of self confidence and low self-esteem. 

It's made even worse by the idea that they're probably straight (or worse - are married) and makes me feel animosity towards them, like I want to be with them but I know I never could. It's also the main reason I don't like couples.

I have anxiety and occasional depression and while I'm on medication for that, it doesn't stop these really unpleasant feelings. Can anyone shed some light on this situation? ",15Nov2017,1,
6,"For a while now I've experienced someone else in my head. Most everyone hears themselves talk or debates with themselves inside their head. But a while back, maybe a year ago if not longer something changed.

Something happened and I started hearing someone else. I consider him to be someone else, but he seems to be more of a part of me. Another version of me rather. When it first happened It freaked me out and I was arguing with him in my head. Afterward I presumed  it was all just me over reacting (at some point I had watched some videos on a girl with Dissisociative Personality Dissorder). But he always seems to turn up time to time.

Why am I asking for an explaination now? I've grown used to him I guess. In fact I just finished an episode of a show and felt strangely. I didn't know how I felt, and then he walked back in and started speaking. He suggested I named him Xavier ( a name of mine I like). I mentioned to him how I felt kinda brain dead (an exaggeration of course) and I told him to leave and he walked out.

The talks are often times strange, as if he is using what I say to bounce off of and respond, sometimes repeating what I say. With my voice.

Am I concerned? Not really, I'm just kind of curious and haven't seen anyone else online like me so I thought I might as well share for the public.

Enjoy :p",15Nov2017,2,

8,"Lately I've noticed that I've been getting irritated at things that most people would just brush off. For example, if someone cuts me off during traffic, I would get really angry and would chase the car down the road to scare them off. Or if I simply don't like a person because of what they did to me or how they act towards me, I would want them in pain or killed. I would say things like ""I hope they die. I hope they would get hit by a bus."" But I would only express this anger towards my parents and a friend of mine who knows about my mental health. I would want to hurt people but I know I won't do it so I imagine them getting hurt. 
I also started verbally abusing my parents. Especially my mom. I love her and I can't live without her but there are times where I snap and I would call her names and I would throw things at her. Few hours later I would feel normal again and pretend like it never happened.
It all started when I got diagnosed with a disease that stopped me from exercising (Exercise used to be my therapy and it made me happy but ever since I stopped, my mental health plummeted.)
Anyway, I want to see my therapist again.  I'm scared I might hurt my parents more or even myself. I'm 22 years old and I'm a female. I want this to stop but I don't know how. ",15Nov2017,3,

10,"Recently, I have experienced major mood swings from emotions like overwhelming sadness and laziness to frustration and wanting to get work done and every emotion in between. In addition to this, I have experienced minor sleep deprivation. Throughout my entire life, I have been able to sleep like a rock, wherever and whenever I wanted, easily. As of late, I have trouble staying asleep for more than 6 hours at a time, as opposed to my normal 7 1/2-8 hours of sleep. 7 hours is my minimum amount of sleep required to be 100% up to speed. The 6 hours I am currently experiencing is effecting my exercise recovery and my focus. I set aside enough time to sleep, but I just can't. I don't know what advice I am really looking for, but I figure I could use some. I have a pretty good Idea why this started happening to me, but lets just say for now that the problem is ""Unsolvable"" at the moment and may persist for months. I am worried my mood swings will leave me feeling emotionally ""callused"" if that makes sense? Like, I am afraid of not truly having powerful emotions anymore. I am not sure if that is a thing, but I see myself headed down that path. This in accordance with insufficient sleep could really hurt me. The problem I have is in danger of not providing any closure, that is why it is such a problem. I have dealt with emotional tragedies in my young life, and I have handled them, but this one is eating me and I don't know why? Any advice, even if it might seem irrelevant, is MUCH appreciated.",15Nov2017,2,

It gets worse every year, and it's so difficult to just function like a normal person on a daily basis already. Thoughts of complete despair keep flooding my brain, my eating disorders are manifesting, and suicide and self-harm are on the VIP list. I have a ""happy lamp"" and I'm watching my diet complete with exercise, but it's not doing much this year. I'm losing more motivation and discipline to keep up with being healthy. 

I'm doing great for my late twenties and I recently started seeing a wonderful guy, although he's moving away in a couple months. I know, logically, I should be completely content and happy. 

I just feel so lost and completely, and utterly hopeless. I really don't know what to do any more. I used to love winters here, but now I fear them and they've become nothing but a struggle for survival.

20,So when I started highschool I wore neon colored accessories silly bands and ring on my index finger I guess since this world is still stupid people just saw that and assumed I was gay so yeah I was bullied for 4 years in highschool gossiped about and had a mental breakdown around my senior year couldn’t take it anymore developed bipolar disorder and schizophrenia it runs in my family my birth mother had schizo I’m adopted. Well ever since my breakdown I haven’t been the same. Going to the mental hospital really took something out of me pyschologically. Sometimes when I go out I get certain feelings that make me want to curl up in my bed like it’s bad it happens frequently and I start to get suicidal from these feelings I don’t know if this is some undiagnosed disorder but yeah. I just need the strength I feel like something was ripped from me when I went to the mental hospital. I just need the strength to get out of my house and get a job so I can get an apartment. I need the strength to lose weight.,15Nov2017,5,

24,"Where to begin..
Well I guess about me. Hey I'm probably the most frustrating human you ever read about today (that is not a president or accused of inappropriate sexual acts) as I'm here to explain/vent on why I'm deserve everything I need and why I shouldn't have it. Well I guess I start about some facts I'm living in the UK male and 24 years old ""studying"" law when my mood is the equivalent of a blob fish I have never had a real relationship and had my first kiss this year but that's for later. Guess the beginning is where I should begin in high school when I was down and angry never really be the most social  I would plan escape routes when we I finally take my anger out on my bullies although this was noting more then the impotent rage of a 13 year old. Although I did do something that I can't remember the reason is that if I didn't have a girlfriend by 21st birthday then I would play hangman alone and with no stool to stand on. We have spilt on this one half says it was noting more then a attempt to self motivate and threat as fear is the only real motivator for me, no gold or peer pressure can persuade me. The other it was a primitive way to express how utterly alone I was.. I am. But this is where the story turns where the story get pitiful as I make my warping success and shattering failure next. Let's start with the success at the time I was clawing for a connection and found a sexual one to be the easiest to get this is where I meet some who I made perhaps I made my deep friendship+ to date..as we talked explored among other things online. But during this I was still longing to have that but in real life and I tried by every deity ever made fictional or otherwise I tried so fucking hard...I was a creep.. I tried still even though she didn't want it.. and when I did go on a date kind of I remember talking with her in the park and the memory is foggy now but I remember this she gave me cleaning supplies, body wash that kind of thing. It still stings and yet I tried still hoping my stubbornness was a declaration of how much I wanted it and willed into reality because of it. It ended poorly very poorly it was a simple goodbye yet afterward I had the most liberating moment of my life there was no reason just the utter sensation of failure I screamed and it felt it like my mind fractured. That it had to, to keep something of me left. I guess that is why I don't really try much any more for when I truely truely tried I was crushed that if I had a friend they could tell. For the next few years it's a whirlwind of creating another persona, personifying aspect of my emotions jealous anger cruelty and kindness. I bet you are wondering about the last one well it's because no amount of stab wounds or rages would make me feel any less shitty so I became kind knowing that maybe if I was kind and helpful maybe someone would or some God would look and think ""he's earn this"" because that's the crux of what I am I'm so unfathomably lonely that I would starve myself.. you remember that girl who I talked online ? Two moments I remember almost sweetly is that just being there I have saved her life and I promised not to hurt myself.. I promised I kept to this day. So at this point I've saved a life and possibly 2 others (as I gave blood twice, the best use for it, give it to someone who needs it). I'm not even 21 yet and still after that I still haven't caught a break as my grandma died who which I was close. I remember watching tashki castle with her and laughing. Sorry I got off topic where was we? So college ended it was 2008 the financial crash and tutorian feeds went up so I went to another college and this time no grand tales of creepy ill learnt boys just a boy trying to fix himself before he became a man. The friends I had in that college were not the best but they are good people and was a important tool to help rebuild myself I learn then just how..logical I am that I couldn't drink after one I would feel sick and the loud beats of club offered no solace to me as I don't..can't let go enough to dance. After college it was 2 years of job hunting this is where my work was undone simply because of one selfless question "" I'm ok, I have a roof and food but others they do not, them getting a job could mean the difference between poverty and homelessness or worse the losses of something irreplaceable who am I to get in the way or that?"" And so I didn't pursue a job as viciously as I should have. And now we have onto the final but not the closing chapter as I went to university to practice law (and yes burr is working next door). My first year was a change I was free from the arguably fair but oppressive rule of my parents mum more so then dad. I haven't talked much about them, my parents I mean but I say this give a million pounds to my dad and he will explore the world with it, my mum she would hoard it and never spend it. But back to university the freedom was a blessing I had room to grow and maybe.. just maybe I will try not to be lonely I grew fond of my classmates talkative and inclusive but noting came of it but I did pick up a hobby dnd the expression was liberating able to use it as a tool to build me back up is amazing. However last year was tough so much happened I meet new people some I keep in touch that halt the flow of constant negativity. However this is where it gets and stays bleak my second year was hard. Firstly I moved into different dorms with new strangers I tried sparking however it didn't work only bumping into one of them into the corridor but yet this rose to a silly fear that if I used the kitchen then if someone walked in as I cooked it is akin so a stranger coming into your house and watching you cook and that alone meant I didn't cook any meals for the whole academic year and only use the microwave later on and dart into the fridge in the early morning as to mimize the chance of people. This was on top of the fact I was on the ground floor with a window that over looked my desk and on a main street so I always heard snippets of conversation and the huge counts who had their shitty music as they waited of the lights to change oh did I also mention the construction work for a new building that was also going on and could hear it in bed And they started early. But there was a few months that was a beacon, a potential for life could be like. I got talking to someone who played dnd with me I don't know how but we talked and I walked her home once or twice she was with someone at the time and said something to the effect of if I meet you earlier I would have said yes if you asked me out"" finally a break something going my way.. we both know things don't go my way without lose. As a few weeks later my nan (grandma) long health issuses caught up to her it was extremely sad but I understood she was old woman and had a busy life.I guess that is a reason why I'm doing this because with each passing day the likelihood of being a old desolate old shell of a man with noting but many empty bottles and scared wrist and a unloved heart whille the people around him, his school mates my own brother surpass me and I become the lonely uncle wishing may be I could have that, people that love you not because of blood but by choice.forgive the tangent but it was needed so my nan just died and on the same week I received my first kiss from the same girl I mention before then cracks appeared. I was scared of what happened last time I wasn't direct enough and yet again I was called a creep. It lead me to counciling where I found I may have aspergers but haven't been tested yet. So a few resits later as this has been havoc on my uni. Work I'm here my 3rd year alone, feeling unloved,unwanted.
The truly sad thing this is right not as I type this I don't want attention or pity what I want.. I always wanted is confirmation because I can't understand it I've always tried to do good, put people before myself and in the belief that somehow I will be rewarded for it. But I haven't all I got from it is noting but misfortune and pain. I've literally saved a person's life quoted from there very mouth and yet I'm the one that is alone... this life is not worth the air it breath but I would hate to bloody the carpet beside they just put it in.

I recently told my mom this after I shoved my older sister when we got in a argument that she had no reason being in, she got up and tried slapping me so I pushed her. Pretty much my mom thinks I'm doing the pitty act, but deep down inside I know she knows the truth, but she can't believe her favorite daughters would do such a thing. Pretty much I'm out to destroy her little dream bubble she puts on around herself, I know it will make matters worse but I kept this to myself for 20 years. It makes me want to jump off a bridge but metaphorical talk, how would I prove to her I was raped? I think that traumatic experience kinda shaped me into a careless and emotionless person? Any advice on what I can do? Would it be smart to get a polygraph test? My  oldest sister might not deny it but younger sister will and her shitty neighbor friend. Anything I can do to prove this?

34,"I am 21 and have been diagnosed as a schizophrenic a year ago. I am currently in the middle of a very bad psychotic break and nothing seems to help. My doctor increased my prescription of antipsychotics, but I am not doing any better. Basically I think that people can always hear my thoughts. I don't think it's through telepathy or anything supernatural, I think that I am literally saying my thoughts out loud. I am a student living in a large shared house and I can hear the people neighbouring my room always answering to my thoughts, which puts me in a never ending conversation with them. I should also mention that I have very intrusive thoughts, so I'm always in a constant state of fear of coming off as a monster to the people who I believe can hear my thoughts. I'm thinking either nasty things about the person who I think can hear me or often fake embarrassing things about myself. I will basically have an intrusive thought and then spend the next few minutes explaining to the people who I think can hear me that it's not really who I am, only to have another intrusive thought after that and so on. I spend all my time in this state and it's killing me.

It seems like medication doesn't work for me. I think that the only thing which can stop this is me convincing myself that it's all in my head, but I don't believe I can do that. I'm coming here as a last resort. If anyone has any advice on what to do next, I'm all ears.",15Nov2017,2,

37,"I'm not entirely sure what happened myself, but if my friends are any indication, something weird happened and I'm kind of scares I'm gonna hurt someone.

The last few weeks have been weird all around, and I guess that leads up to our story. I had been getting the urge to get up, leave everything behind and take an extended road trip, school responsibility or work requirements be damned. I've been forgetting to do things that I wouldn't normally forget. I've apparently been erratic. I've been missing classes (I'm in college so there's less regulation there) being really whiny at nothing and almost crying for no reason. 

However, yesterday is where it all culminated into the mess that I'm describing. 

I remember feeling weird all day yesterday. The only way I can describe it is as being there but not fully being there. I was spacing out in my favorite classes, being more distant and forgetful than usual and being a lot more self conscious and, of course, spacy than normal. 

Well after class, everyone met as usual to hang out and that's where things just hit the fan, so to speak. My friend and I have been playing fighting all day, throwing each others stuff and just generally jibing each other. I had a bottle of soda and we were shaking it up and throwing it. Well I got to playfully open it towards his general direction and he aims it at my jacket sleeve. Normal fair. 

However, I stand up, ready to playfully yell at him and something snaps. I began to LAUGH in a way that sounded like heaving to my friends. And I couldn't stop. I couldn't feel a thing. According to my friends I spent fifteen minutes manically breathing and laughing. I kept clenching my fists and unclenching them. I wasn't even mad at him it was a joke and I know it but for some reason I wanted to let out anger at him and do that dumb thing girls do where they hit someone's chest without hurting them. 

I remember my friend handing me my inhaler, thinking I'm going through an asthma attack and my response was to throw it back at her. I remember standing there, stiff as a board. I remember wanting to cry like three times as this happened but I couldn't for some reason.

It sounds like I'm just a naturally violent person who wanted to fight people, im generally not. I have a tendency to avoid confrontation and I've never actually fought anyone. my intentions were not to swing and hit this guy and knock him out, my intentions were more or less you use him as a catalyst to my emotions which isn't healthy or helpful but whatever. I don't think I could fight this dude if I tried anyway, he's like a foot taller than me. 

What scares me is I don't know what happened to me. Even the next day, the day I posted this, I feel quite like I did yesterday. my thoughts are quite muddled now and I'm forgetting things at work. my drawer at work was more off than usual cause I was distracted. Im embarrassed to go see these friends again but more importantly I'm confused and a bit scared. Does anyone know what happened or what I do to help?",15Nov2017,2,

40,"Hello, hope everyone is well.

So I've dealt with depression and anxiety in varying degrees since I was in school. Haven't been all that successful in how I've dealt with it, but I'm mainly here for advice about some borderline (or not?) obsessive thoughts I've been having.

Since I learned about it when I was maybe 15 I've always had the idea of determinism in the back of my head. I'm closer to 30 than 20 now, but it didn't really become an issue until a few years ago. I had been using opiates to help with my loneliness and misery, and as they always do with drugs, things reached a tipping point. I fell into a pretty bad depression about new years 2015, with free will and responsibility becoming subjects I thought about almost non stop for a good few weeks. I'm lucky enough to live in a country with access to support, so I got help for the drug problem, but the obsession hasn't really left.

Today has been bad. I had planned to write a long sprawling post about the arguments for and against and my thoughts about society and how we deal with the issue etc, but really I doubt there's anything I could say that you couldn't find in some book on the subject.

What worries me is the fact that I just can't seem to stop thinking about it. It's been nearly 2 years now and it remains the thing I spend the most effort thinking about. There's never any conclusion. I never get any answers or insight, or motivation, or even peace. It's not like I'm thinking ""Well determinism means I'm not at fault for anything, problem solved"", then sit back and relax. It's more like arguing with myself constantly about how it doesn't make sense one way or the other. 

Frankly I'm tired. I spent a good few weeks exercising and eating well, cutting out sugar etc, trying to be mindful, but it didn't really help. I've just started on some medication for the first time in years because I'm at a loss of how to deal with it really, and the suicidal thoughts were getting too bad. More worryingly I've been feeling increasingly like a victim, and angry at society. It's not that I've never been frustrated at the society we live in before, everyone feels that way sometimes. But recently I've felt really isolated and alone. I don't see my friends anymore and I barely go out, mostly because I feel like I can't engage with people when I don't believe in the same fundamental truths that they do. It's getting to the point where I feel like there isn't a ""me"" anymore. It's not that I don't know what to think but rather I don't know how to choose what to think, or how to value one way of thinking over another. Even the idea of rationality has become strange to me, it seems that as rationally as you try to think you can never act rationally, I mean, what would such an act even be, something that increases happiness, something that increases our future options? It's not that I think rationality doesn't have its place, we need to use it, but the idea that we're purely rational creatures that choose how we behave using only reason and logic seems crazy to me.

I suppose I'm hoping that someone here has experienced this before, and has some advice. Or any books that may enlighten me. Thanks for reading.",15Nov2017,1,
41,"Here's a interesting topic that I'm currently dealing with. (Do excuse my sloppy typing, at the moment, I'm just waking up)

Why is America leading high with depression and anxiety?

I'm a in-between being asocial man (not too much of a people person) to social person (the only time where I'm forced to be social is at employments)

I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder in 2016 and was forced to be hospitalized by my psychiatrist at the time.

I realized when growing up, I couldn't never fit in, feel right at home when interactions with others as I got stuttering, weight issues, heavy bullied in school and lack social deeds, I was in special education classes, which admitting that it's hard for me to meet people and lack the motivation.

I realized I'm coming down with depression over time from events in my life. But I do paid off all of my bills and I need to be social more but I don't know how.

Anyways, back on topic from my personal sentiments, I think what leads Americans to have have anxiety problems and depression, is lack of face to face conversation, not enough social events for young people, everybody seems be on social media (lol even myself) and people too busy with stress and worrying with bills and money.

I was recently talking to foreigners from around the world and it's quite interesting that they don't have mental health facilities where they're from and I wonder from my viewpoint that America isn't a country for trying to be social.

That's all for now. Thank you for reading this.",15Nov2017,2,
42,"So, 4th time is the charm, eh? Or so i hope... I have been to 3 psychologists in the last few years. All gave me the same ""Just try to think about it differently"" level bullshit, that helped nothing. My depression and anxiety are now seriously ednagering my ability to finish university, not just On Time, but AT ALL.

How can I politely and respectfully tell a psychologist that ""Look, either we get to psychotherapy and/or medication within a month or thanks and goodbye""? 

I know making a diagnosis takes time. I'm okay with that. What I'm NOT okay with is spending months and hundreds of dollars sothat I can go to a strangers place for an hour to tell them about my week, and then listen to them advise ""Did you try just ignoring it?"" ",15Nov2017,3,
43,"I hope this is the right place to ask, if so buckle up because I am about to let it all out. Does anyone else live in a constant state of panic that their potential significant other will wise up and leave you? I recently met someone and we seem to be hitting it off pretty good, we are currently in the ""get to know each other"" phase. Before meeting I had not dated anyone for about four years and was not doing too bad, mental wise. I was always thinking how nice it would be to be with someone and share experiences with, and that I would be extremely happy if I did meet someone. Unfortunately happiness is not what I am feeling, more like a constant state of fear. It's not like the significant other is bad, they are actually really nice, but I am constantly in fear that they will run off and find someone else (as did my previous long term significant other did). I feel like an abandoned dog if I do not receive a text back within a couple of hours. And when I do get a reply I always think I will somehow mess things up and scare them away with my next text. To quickly sum up my life I had divorced parents growing up and my current job takes me away from my family and friends (every couple of years I have to move because of the job). I also find it difficult to connect with people because I always know that one day I am going to have to leave again and probably never see them again.",15Nov2017,2,
44,"I'm 21 years old and have had consistent anxiety and spells of depression since I was about 14. I've been prescribed citalopram in the past, however I haven't seen a doctor or been on any medication for years now. I find socialising to be very difficult, and observing the way people are with each other in social situations makes me feel totally alienated. I struggle with small talk, and even when discussing subjects I am interested in or knowledgeable on I feel like my brain shuts down, and I become an empty shell of a person with nothing to say (unless I'm talking to someone I'm extremely comfortable with). When my depressive episodes are over I often feel energetic and productive, I'll begin working on creative projects like songwriting/poetry/script writing etc, but I never finish any of them and get easily distracted with frantic thoughts and new ideas or plans. I am extremely paranoid and jump to irrational conclusions about myself or my friends. Deep down I know I have great family and friends but these thoughts tell me otherwise, I convince myself people don't like me or that they're against me in some way when I have no logical basis for this. I know I should see a doctor but I tend to sleep most of the day and stay up all night, so never get around to booking appointments. I desperately want to change the way I am but I don't know how or where to start. Does anyone recognise these symptoms or been through anything similar and can offer advice?

47,"The past few months have been completely shit and I can't help but dread the future. I just need to vent, let all this heavy shit out. 

I am currently an art student trying to balance school, work, social life and family. All of which are kind of on fire. 

Let's start off with my social life. I basically have none, besides the few friends at school that I don't get to hang out with very often. I recently got out of a long term realtionship, and it's extremely hard for me to be genuinely happy around people. I feel like a drag, and I feel guilty for not feeling happy during social events. So instead I excuse myself from that inorder to not be a ""party pooper."" But that makes me feel so alone at the same time. I mean there is nothing wrong with being alone, I understand that it's healthy. But I find myself in times of need such as now, and I don't have anyone to talk to. Sometimes I get so desperate that I call my ex, which is does not help. It reminds me that I'm just weak and makes me feel so much worse. Not becuase he's horrible, he's super sweet, but because it reminds me of how much of a close friend I lost. 

Onward to school. I am an art student. You may think all we do is paint and draw... yeah we do and OTHER THINGS. I have a combination of 5 hour studio classes and 3 hour academic classes. This semester I am part time, due to my financial situation and mental health. But I still have 15- 18 hours of class for 4 days. So yeah half the time I feel sleep depreived or stressed as shit trying to meet deadlines. And it's really starting to get to me. I'm burning out. I used to be so passionate, but now I just feel like I'm doing mindless/ souless work that just DOES NOT inspire me. I want to take my spring semester off, but it will total ruin my class schedule. It will also ruin my chances of moving closer to school (I have a deal with my mom's close friend, who is currenlty looking for a house over there and is willing to accomadate me), I currently commute an hour to two hours every time I go to school. Which makes going to school even more of a drag. 

Work... I currently TA for an amazing professor for a 5 hour studio class. On top of that I part-time model and make some money from that, helping with photographer's portfolio, modeling for small brands, etc. I am starting a teaching job which involves teaching coding to children, but I have not started because I need to make my own ciriculumn... BUT I HONESTLY HAVE NOT FOUND THE TIME AND DAY TO MAKE IT. so yeah... I also work freelane as an artist for a nonprofit organization, working on their fundraising and gala events and whatever else they may need. I believe this job is extremely important for my future if I want a firm grasp in the political/ nonprofit world. I work a lot so I can support my own financial needs and save up money for rent.

Now on to the thing I dread the most. My fucking chaotic family. My parents are going through a divorce. That said. I still live at home in this chaotic enviroment. I feel like I am walking through a minefield everytime I come home. I never know who's going to start yelling, who's going to start crying, and whatever. My relationship with my parents are seperate and I would say is pretty good. But due to the divorce, my relationship with my father has begun to take a toll. Last week he kicked me out, and long story short I am back in the house becuase I am dependent on his financial help for school (which remind you, school is my number one priority, regardless of how draining it is for me) It was just a mess, I constantly fight about curfew, money, my ""irrational descisions"" and going to church(my parents are EXTREMELY religious, I go to church every week, I don't enjoy it as much as I was a kid, but I still go). He tracks me, withholds my checks, reads my text messages and everything else. I want to scream. It is so irritable. I want to move out with my dog, who is my baby, and just leave. I want a good relationship with my dad, but he does not understand I am growing up and I need space to grow. I feel trapped and I am starting to feel like I am drowning.

Last week I think I had the most extreme mental break down. I fought with my dad and I realized how little I had and how I really had nothing more to lose. I cried all day, wrote some notes for friends and family, and was ready to let everything go. I sat in my bed holding whatever. But instead I fell asleep. I was woken up by my sister and was told to eat. But that thought of death and finding my peace hasn't really left me.  

There's so much going through my head from going to class, to how I am going to support myself and my dog, and what the future holds. It's a mess and I feel like my head is going to split open from my constant migraines. 

I just need some guidance. Maybe spiritual guidance, maybe something else. I'm barely 20 and I know I shouldn't have everything figured out, but I would like to have some undertsanding of what the fuck is going on.

On the plus side, I have my first therapy session Friday to help. I also have an amazing professor that I have been talking to, and I don't know. ",15Nov2017,3,
48,"Can anyone else relate? I work as a cashier at a grocery store and that job is the bane of my existence. I have depression and bipolar but I wasn't aware of the latter until I already was working retail. I will give the devil its due, it has almost completely removed my anxiety with talking to strangers. That was a huge problem with me now it's pretty manageable. But since taking that job I have taken such a much lower opinion on people in general and have dissociated a lot. Don't talk to nearly the same amount of people I used too. I have helped that recently because I have been forcing myself too, but I used to just want to have more interaction just normally. While most customers are nice enough to just let you do your job and get them out of there, the asshole ones are enough drive you insane. So much stress dealing with them. I know this is kinda weird but can anyone else relate? I swear having a shift of lots of asshole customers is a one way trip to depression.",15Nov2017,7,
49,"Every day I see people who seem to be on top of it all. People who know where they are and where they’re heading. People with balance and variety in their lives. And when I observe these people, I realize that I am not like them. My actions will never allow me to reach to their level, in fact it’s my very lack of action in almost all circumstances that is pushing me further and further away from the life I want. Nothing scares me more than the life I deserve, and the life I will end up with if I continue down this path. Complacency, mediocrity, and a truly underwhelming life are all I can expect based on how I live now. How could I ever hope to change if I haven’t changed yet? I experience anguish and anxiety on a daily basis, sometimes making me wish I was dead. But even this is not enough to spur me into action. I have never kept a promise I made to myself, nor have I ever committed to something that I believe is worthwhile. Mostly, I just waste day after day doing nothing in particular, yet still somehow hoping everything will work out. Worse still, I long for emotional attachment but in my heart I feel like I don’t deserve it. What do I even have to offer a potential partner? I may be kindhearted and loving, but my boring lifestyle and obvious lack of willpower is probably going to keep me from finding my soulmate. I know that one day I will die, and every second I’m alive is a precious opportunity, yet I throw them all away. I wrote this because I didn’t know what else to do. I’m so scared.",15Nov2017,2,

51,"There's this girl that I really like. And she has rejected me multiple times already. And even then, I *still* can't stop thinking that if I ask one more time, she'll say yes. I'm not talking specifically about asking her to date me, but anything really. Going to the movies, taking a walk, just letting her know of something I saw that I found amusing.

If for some reason I'm gonna have extra free time this week, I immediately think of asking her out to do something.

The problem is, that like I said in the beginning, she has already rejected me multiple times. She made it **very** clear she does not want to spend time with me and that I mean nothing to her. And still, I can't think of her not saying yes. Like, I imagine asking her to the cinema, and the only thing that goes through my head is that she says yes. The possibility of her rejecting whatever I'll say just doesn't cross my mind. At all.

I also can't remember any of the times she rejected me. That is, I do remember the conversation. I remember listening to her saying it, and I remember what she said. But that moment when she says ""I don't wanna be with you"" just disappears from my head every time.

It's like no matter how many times she says no, I still believe she'll say yes.

Even though I'm fully aware her answer will be no, to whatever I say, I still can't stop only picturing her saying yes, and end up asking her out anyway. So I had to end up deleting her contact information so that I would stop talking to her. 

Me seeing her everyday during classes also doesn't help.

This isn't normal right? It's not just straight positive thinking or believing in happy endings? It's like my brain refuses to accept the fact that she simply doesn't want anything to do with me.

I'm 21 btw.",15Nov2017,2,

53,"I have been diagnosed with ADD, ADHD, Depression, and Anxiety. I am medicated for depression and anxiety, though it's not as effective as it used to be. But sometimes when my friends and family ask why I can't do something or why I won't do something, like going to the gym (which I actually do love to do!!) it's hard. I struggle so hard with motivation to do things, its like my ADD won't let me focus. My ADHD won't let me stay in one place. And my anxiety makes me feel guilty for not doing things but then makes me paranoid about being judged constantly. The last thing I want to do is use my mental health as an excuse for me not succeeding the way I know I can. I am exhausted from constantly battling my own mind. I don't know how to explain this to anyone. My fiancee tries to be as understanding as possible, and he's incredibly supportive, but I feel that even he thinks I'm just being lazy. Is anyone else just plain exhausted from fighting a war with yourself? That no one else can see?

54,"Hello all,
I am having issues with Lamictal causing crying and rage at 200mg. It never really did work well at 150. It kept me from getting really depressed but I felt very ""blah"" like I was seeing everything in brown and gray. I had great success with Prozac in the past but had such bad side effects I had to stop. Since then tried Effexor, which was ineffective and now Lamictal causing these strange side effects. It definitely isn't just a sign of my depression as usual...the rage and crying feels extremely distinct and random. I tested it out by skipping a few doses and did not experience these feelings. When I went back on it started up again! 

My psych is very hesitant to put me on SSRIs as he thinks this will make me manic and that I am bipolar 2 (depression in waves, some days with more energy) but I'm starting to think his diagnosis was incorrect to start with and probably and more general depression. He is very insistent I am bipolar just because at SOME point in my life I've had elevated moods (don't most people?). 

I would really like to try Wellbutrin despite the risk of mania. I really feel like I need something to ELEVATE my mood like Prozac rather than a mood stabilizer. My depression usually manifests as hopelessness, a zombie feeling where I feel like I'm just sleepwalking through life: eating, sleeping, working, repeat and just deep, deep sadness. I don't really have manic episodes.  

Anyone have any lucky with Wellbutrin?",15Nov2017,1,
55,"Q: How does one smuggle a distressed Ass past the farmhouse?
A: Get a mute Ass.

When people are **SCREAMING** for **HELP** because they don't know how to keep on fighting, they still hide. They hide because they fear what would happen if they came out, if they became visible.
But they scream nonetheless, through visible scars and deafening silence, through their glaring lack of presence, sometimes even with hints in the form of spoken words.
But the screaming mutes remain unheard, because the visible either don't know or don't wish to know sign language.
