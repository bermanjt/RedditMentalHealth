7,"So, I've been toying with the idea of Blogging about my struggles, nothing too in depth. Just a running commentary that I can look back on, and something that may help others in the same situation. 

I have struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. It has been getting worse as we come into the Christmas period as I lost my Grandmother last year. 

Any tips?

8,"I'll give a bit of background, I have struggled with depression for most of my life, we think I  got depressed at 5 years old, but I didn't get diagnosed until I was 15. I'm 21 now. In that time I've also struggled with anorexia. I did inpatient and day hospital over a year and a half ago. Treatment and the first year went well. Still very depressed and I tried a few different treatment options and none worked. The next 6 months, I started to lose weight. I'm now underweight. I don't think I have a problem. I'm eating most of my meals, I'm still functional, I go to school and I'm doing well too. This week my ED therapist suggested I do some day hospital over the winter break but I don't have time. And now my psychiatrist also said I have a problem. 

I don't have a problem, but everyone keeps saying I do. The more they keep saying it, it makes me want to go back to the ED just to spite them and show that what a real problem looks like. 

I've lost hope that I'll ever get better. I've been told that I will likely never be happy and that I just need to learn how to live with being depressed. But that isn't a life I want to live. If I were to relapse I think I'd go all the way and end it once I got thin enough. I just don't know what to do anymore.",25Nov2017,3,
9,"I feel trapped between these two states. 

I've always been fine with being quite and introverted in the past, in fact, I preferred it. I enjoyed being alone and having independence, but lately any time i'm alone I start feeling lonely and depressed.

These feelings seem to go when i'm around other people, but at a cost. I feel like I can only socialize and be around others for so long before I start feeling drained and anxious to the point where I become very self-conscious of my behaviour.

It was weird writing this. I've felt this creeping up subconsciously for a while now but never verbalized or even thought about it - I think I was trying to avoid it, hoping it would just go away. Hopefully this resonates with someone whose had a similar experience.

10,"Sibling has BPD, and I started having depressive symptoms when I was 12, which got *really* bad at 14, and has never went away (I’m in college for reference), but some things have gotten better, new things developed.  Fun.

My sibling was misdiagnosed, but she was taken to therapists and psychiatrists.  Me?  I got threats to be taken to psych hospitals and told how “awful” they are.  I got strip searched, questioned constantly, and everyone was told what I had done to myself and that I was (undiagnosed) depressed.  And then we just pretended nothing was wrong and I just “got better.”

No doctors.  No help.  Just throwing my issues under the rug.

And now I have to try to recover from past abuse because I already knew at 12-14 (and earlier) I’d be blamed.  I already knew all that would come of it is me being in trouble.  I have to deal with symptoms from a disorder that isn’t even diagnosed yet because mental health problems run in the family, and I had every environmental reason to develop one.

It’s so frustrating.  Maybe I could have been ok now.  Maybe I could be confident in myself and what I’m doing and that my mental health won’t cause an issue in career choices.

11,"The following is a story that 100% truthfully happened to me about two years ago. I couldn't explain it then and I can't explain it now. It has haunted me for years.

I originally posted my story to nosleep, but was advised to post non-fiction stories elsewhere.

I live in Oregon City, Oregon, but mentally I'd compare it to Derry Town from Stephen King's IT. It's a short drive south of Portland. I live on the outskirts of where it sits somewhere between suburban and rural housing. I have neighbors, but they're not exactly ""next door"". I was 19 at the time of this story. I used to have a problem with sleep. I don't know what it was, but I'd get mentally crippling anxiety and I'd go for a walk to calm my mind. I live on a single lane road that follows a stream through the woods so, needless to say, the scenery mixed with the quiet trickle was always quite calming. It was summertime and I remember it to be a particularly rough night for me.

I remember telling my dad that I was going for a walk as I hurriedly slipped on my shoes and hustled out. I still remember the look on his face as I tried to escape in the midst of my own mental panic. He looked worried about me. My late night walks had gained frequency at the time and I knew it was starting to concern him. Nevertheless, I shut the door behind me and proceeded into the dark. I remember it being clear skies but I don't remember stars. The moon must have been full as well because I could see the road without light but I don't remember seeing the moon itself that night either.
I remember I just started walking. Talking to myself about everything that had my anxiety spiked. I'm sure I looked insane, rambling to myself, but sometimes it helped me process the issues by just talking it out. From my home to the main road is about a mile. I was about 2/3 of the way to the main road when I heard something rustle in the bushes to my right. 

This wasn't uncommon. I'd jumped deer, raccoons, a bobcat, and even a few coyotes on my walks, but I still liked to know what was around.
I pulled out my phone and flicked on the light. For context, there's a hill to my right that goes up. This is where I heard the noise. To my left is a 10 foot drop into the creek. I shined my light into the bushes to see what I was dealing with. Usually these things either freeze or scamper off in my experience which helps me know what it is. Nothing. There was nothing there. I don't know what set me off but my hair started to stick up. I felt scared. I tensed and I realized that the creek should be audible as the water ran over the rocks but I couldn't hear it like I normally could.

Something clearly was wrong. I heard a branch snap in the bushes again. I moved my light back and just saw lights looking back. Two small red lights, like eyes. I moved my light to see if it was a reflection off something. It wasn't. Instead it started to get closer. I ran. I fucking RAN. I ran in near silence. I don't know if I screamed. I know it didn't matter. I couldn't hear my own shoes hitting the road. I couldn't hear my own breathing or my heartbeat pounding in my ears as I ran faster than I ever had. All I heard was what sounded like an animal with human bare feet chasing me.
I looked back and saw that it had a head bearing resemblance to a dog but it wasn't like a normal dog since it was running on two feet. I don't know what primal survival instinct kicked in but something told me I needed to find light. Not the light on my phone that could be squashed but something bigger. The first place I went for was home. There's a large barn light out front of my family's house. It's bright and covers the whole driveway. I ran like hell was on my heels because for all I knew, it was. I just remember hearing it getting closer as I ran. It was running me down but I feel like it was toying with me. 

It's footstep pattern didn't sound like an all out sprint. More like a light gallop. It wasn't until I rounded the last corner and the light became visible that it all of a sudden picked up pace and started to close the distance. I ran full sprint to the light pole as it gained. I heard it's furious steps come to an abrupt stop, but I didn't turn back.
I tackled the tar covered wooden light post as best as any 19 year old kid can. I stayed there clutching that disgusting, sticky post, waiting for the end. Waiting for this thing to tear me apart. It never did. I sat there for an hour in the silence until my phone rang. I had three messages and two prior calls. All from my dad asking where I was. I lied and said I fell asleep in a field up the road. I realized I could hear the world again and assumed that meant it had left. I ran inside the house and locked the doors. To this day, I don't walk alone on my road. Day or night. I know what you're probably thinking, ""it was probably just your mind playing tricks"" or ""it was probably just an animal"". 

I've seen animals. I know what animals are near my home. This was nothing that has ever lived here. This story made me think back to some of the other things I'd seen and experienced out here. Things I couldn't explain.
A fully grown deer, burned from the inside out for instance. The only way you'd have known is from the single area in the ribs that had burnt through the perfectly preserved flesh and bone. Moments where I'd find myself seeming to slip through time. My alarm would go off at 6AM and I'd wait outside for my ride for three hours just to come back in and see it was only just turned to 5AM. Shadow Figures by the side of the road. A couple unexplained deaths. The list goes on. I'm telling you, something strange and terrifying is out here. Some nights I wonder, do my doors and windows really keep whatever it is out, or is it still just toying with me?

Edit: if anyone has any ideas what the fuck I'm dealing with, please let me know.",25Nov2017,0,

19,"So, I haven't really messed with reddit too much before now, so I apologize if I'm doing anything wrong or something. Ever since a few years ago, I have had fantasies about bad things happening to me. Things like pets dying, my parents or little brother being hurt, being abused, however the one that pops up most with me is rape. I have read about rape fantasies, but I don't think it's as innocent as that; I honestly, truly want it to happen to me. It's funny that I want these things to happen to me because real people truly suffer from them and would love to have a privileged life such as mine. I also find it funny that I fantasize being abused by a family member or spouse since not too long ago, I lived with my biological father, who was a very narcissistic, emotionally abusive man. 

Of course, I know that if any of these things actually happened to me, I would not be happy. That would be the logical (as logical as a young teen girl can get, that is) side of my brain talking. And I also have a strange relationship with self harm and suicide, often contemplating the results of said actions/behaviors, but I would never go through with these thoughts because that would be a horribly selfish and inconsiderate thing to do to my loved ones. So basically, I don't believe I or my family is palaced in any innate danger from these fantasies. 

I think it most likely stems from extreme attention seeking behavior, which is probably the most destructive thing about it because if there is anything that I hate about myself, it's that I desperately need attention, recognition, and validation. I'm not sure whether it's just normal teenager-level attention seeking or off-the-charts-you-need-to-go-see-a-therapist-right-now-madame levels of attention seeking. I'm not even sure if it is attention seeking and I'm just throwing in a solution so that I can hate myself more about it. 

But I want to know whether I should be worried. Whether I should, you know, ignore it or start screaming and call a suicide hotline immediately. Also sorry for the long post and for not knowing how to reddit properly lol. But if anyone has any idea about this I'd love to hear it. Thanks!",25Nov2017,5,
20,"Hi,
Ever since I was about 12-13 (about 4 years ago) I've been ""obsessed"" with mental disorders. What I mean by this, is that I go through phases where I start to show a couple of symptoms of a mental disorder, and then take a bunch of quizzes on the internet to try and get it to show up that I have said disorder. Or sometimes it's the other way round, and I first take a mental illness quiz and it comes up as 'very high' or whatever for a disorder, then I obsessively search up symptoms for said disorder and convince myself I have it.
For example, some of the disorders I've obsessively searched about are: major depression disorder, dysthymia, cyclothymia, bipolar disorder, anxiety, seasonal affective disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and borderline personality disorder. 
Also, don't know if this makes a difference, but i go through a ""phase"" of doing this for like a week every like 1-2 months.

I currently go to a therapist, but I haven't really gotten around to talking about this. She thinks that I have social anxiety disorder, but I think there's more to the problem than that. And I don't know if its a real concern, or if I'm just so obssesed with mental disorders that I want to have a more ""exciting"" one. 

My questions for you guys are, do you think this is worth discussing with my therapist? And, would any of you know if this would classify as a certain symptom, or if it's just like an obsession? 

 And, also I know that this is kind of against the rules, and probably enabling my problem, but if there's any mental disorder that you'd associate this with, could you let me know? The other two questions are more important than this, though.

Here's my experience I'm a third year in college and I have a few friends but spend a lot of time alone not by choice usually. Anyways I don't know if anyone else feels like this but I always feel like I'm missing out on college after I see all these snapchats, instagram posts, and tweets of people hanging with friends they've met in college/ going to college parties and having the time of their lives. I mean I'm aware people are only posting the good things and leaving out the bad but I can't help when any sort of vacation time  comes along and I'm outside of the school setting feeling like I truly have no friends. I mean I'm aware I can invite people out to do things but I always have self doubt. ""Theyre not going to want to/have the time for it"" ""If they really wanted to spend time with you they should talk to you first/invite you out"" So then I end up depressed thinking that something is wrong with me and that outside a school environment no one wants to hang out with me. And the only thing I can do is watch everyone hang out with their friends on Instagram/Snapchat/etc.  Sorry for going off topic a bit but these are just some thoughts I wanted to get off my chest.

22,"I grew up with an insecure father who literally wanted to compete against my mother on who was the better parent. (Background story) my moms side is very wealthy so they provided a savings and bought a 600k house to start our family. My stubborn Dad created so many unsuccessful companies that acquired enough debt to sell the house. My mom is a very caring and understanding person who gives A LOT of chances and she also doesn't want to divorce to damage her kids mental health. At the age of 12 I started to realize my Dad only cared about the stuff on the outside. Paying for dinners, newest iphones, shoes, and clothes from month to month. Always emphasizing the holidays and birthdays all the time. Sounds nice right? It was up until I realized this trend a couple years later, that my mother is the one doing all the dirty work paying all the bills + my tuition. My mom is the one cleaning the house and washing dishes and providing me love everyday. My Dad is earning $11 dollars an hour in a hotel and laying at the couch at home. He likes selling fake antiques in an auction show hoping to strike gold, not to mention not giving any money to my mom. But somehow he tries so hard to put up this fake persona that he's better because he provides all the extra flashy materialistic items. He never really bonded with me or knows what I like or what my favorite color is. When I was 17 my parents finally divorced and I didn't even know who that man was... just some fraud trying to impress me for all these years.

23,"Hey everybody. Figured I'd come here and maybe seek some help.

So.. Im depressed, been for years, also have really bad anxiety. Some times of the year its horrible and some times its just eh, dealing with it. But overall, im beginning to just feel tired of it. Now, im always tired of it but in tired of dealing with it. Im tired of feeling the way i do all the fuckinggg time. I want it to change. My schedule doesnt help it either.

 Right after highschool, I moved an hour away. I have no friends where I live, mainly because im not old enough to jus go to one of the bars or something and meet people(plus idk how the places are around here w/ fake ID's), and I'm not quite sure how else to meet people. I have a full time job, i drive forklift and do some other things at a pretty big warehouse. I work 5:30pm to 5:30am. Takes about 30-40 mins to get there aswell. I have friends at work, but being 40mins possibly more away from chilling w them and meeting new people seems pointless when i could go to my old city and chill with the people i know, go to the bar there and feel comfortable. But even with this, i maybe get out once, maybe twice a month( not counting work)

I'm at the point where i've always been. Lost. I feel like I have nothing going for me and that I'm simply lost. Put here by accident. If it wasn't for my mom and knowing how much pain it would put here through, I woulda ended these awful feelings already.

But, since thats not an option as of right now, i just want it to change. Im tired of the feelings I have. Those of you that have gone through depression and beat it, what did you do? How did you go about maybe seeing someone to talk to or a doctor or something. I have too much anxiety to EVEN go to the doctor or a pyschiatrist about this shit. I hate it. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.

25,"Posting this with my alt. This is a serious question. 

This is something which I've honestly been considering for a long time. So much so I used to write notebooks talking about my mother (and sometimes father) and how they react and behave, hoping one day someone would read it and diagnose them with something.

Now it sounds like I'm in an abusive family. Well I am not. My parents are genuinely loving and we live in a nice neighborhood and life is good in general. 

The thing is, when stressed out or when in certain situations, my parents show a completely different side and they act like totally different people. I have already came to the conclusion that my father may have autism/aspergers.  I'm not even saying that in a snarky way, he genuinely shows these signs and just doesn't act normal in so many occasions. It got to the point where I - and even my family - feel sorry for him, and just live with it. Weirdly enough he's actually a Professor in his field of study. But I'll save that for another time. 

What I'm worried about is my mother. She has always shown these signs and I am very concerned for her. These are some of the moments in my life where I figured something was wrong with her:

- One day her and my sister were fighting and she gave my sister a bruise on her leg
- She misinterprets a lot of things and twists it to victimise herself
- She always talks to me to rant about her life/her latest argument with my sister or father, as if I was a stress doll
- She cries that no one in the house loves her even if we talk to her often and ask to go out somewhere, but each time we propose she says no
- EVERY birthday, regardless of what we get her she complains and acts like her life is awful
- For the past 3 Christmas' she ends up crying and leaving the house before lunch, for reasons none of us understand
- She has good intentions, but is genuinely slow and confused, and if you ever question/point out her flaws she takes it as if you're attacking HER and her intentions
- Once she was driving with my sister and I (and was over-reacting to something I can't even remember) and threatened to crash the car
- She constantly victimises herself and talks about how depressing her life is. This may sound bad, but she is genuinely over dramatizing it.
- Gets into arguments with everyone

There are more, but it's really hard to explain. All you have to do is observe her interactions and you can tell she has some issue.

Whenever we have an argument I stay reasoned and calm, and listen to what she has to say. But she shouts, interrupts and hates being corrected. Whenever I tell her the truth she takes the higher horse and says things like ""you never stop talking"" or ""please listen to me"", despite the fact that I am quiet most of the time.

Once every 3 months we have a big argument over nothing, bcause she overreacts, and we don't speak for a couple of weeks. She acts like she doesn't care or love us, but breaks down after a few weeks and tries to communicate with us like a child. 

In fact she shows childish qualities a lot. Mocking (repeating what you said in a stupid tone, sarcasm), insults (""I wish you weren't my child"" (another over reaction), ""are you disabled?"") etc. What scares me is how normal she acts afterwards. Sometimes I genuinely think she could be suicidal. I can no longer tell if she is over-reacting or not. 

After a lot of arguments between her and anyone else in the house she tends to cry. And a lot of the time I cry as a result. But it has been going too long now. I don't want her tears to emotionally manipulate me. So what can I do? Because she clearly has something wrong with her but I don't know what to do.

26,"Just wanna say this out front, I don’t want anybody to feel any emotions towards this I just wanna know what I’m feeling. So I’ll give a brief story here. My parents were getting divorced a few months ago after my dad cheated on my mom a few years ago. This was back in the summer now, when they were getting divorced. They split up but it was never official. They then fixed things (for a while) I was fine during this time, but I was feeling pretty down. I went to smoking during the first “divorce”, thought I’d give it a try see why people do it, yknow. I found it kinda made me feel almost happy I guess. Don’t know how to explain it. It kinda made it easier to go through the troubles. I was addicted to nicotine and it was hard to go a day without it. Then when my parents got back together I was feeling a lil bit better and didn’t need the smokes. I quit instantly, even though I was addicted. I just didn’t need it anymore. And now they are going through with the divorce. It makes it harder now cause I thought everything would be fine and then it all comes crashing down. I feel sad a lot of the time and every little thing that probably shouldn’t make me sad and probably isn’t really a big deal and I know this, but it still makes me sad. I just don’t know why. This is gonna sound probably hilarious cause it makes me sad idk why but even when it makes me sad I’m kind of embarrassed to admit it. My girlfriend was going to get her belly button pierced in two weeks and I was going to go with her when she got it done, we had it all planned. Then she changed dates to today and got it done today. I worked today and she still really wanted me to go. I couldn’t miss work though, and she kept telling me to miss work to go with her. I wanted to so fucking bad I don’t know why it meant something to me cause it’s just a piercing. She got it done anyway, I told her if she wanted me to go with her she’d have to go when we originally planned it. But she went and got it done. After that I don’t know what I felt but I was sad and it’s like almost funny sounding to me that i was sad and still am about it. I feel like there’s something wrong with me cause little things like this make me sad. Shit I feel like I’m repeating myself over and over. I hope somebody can just lemme know if they’re going through the same thing and what I can do to stop myself from feeling this way over little things like this. It hurts and it’s getting worse the more it happens and I don’t know what to do. Thanks if anybody can help. I’d appreciate it.

27,"I don't enjoy anything, and compared to others I would say my emotions are typically 10-20% intensity. I just don't feel anything. I can pretend extremely well, but I can drop a smile instantly, even while laughing. I'm pretty apathetic. I don't feel like anything has value, even stuff that I like. I'm falling behind in school, have no social life, waste all sorts of time. 

I'm also incessantly tired. It looks like I wear eyeshadow because of the discoloration and I can see parts of my skull through my skin. At school, I worry that I'm always walking around with my mouth open because of the amount I yawn.

I've had a depression diagnosis for years now but I don't even know that I should anymore. The thing is: I don't feel sad. I'm mostly incapable of crying, even when I try to. I feel like I've just accepted everything. Sure, I still feel 'hopeless', and I think about killing myself every so often, but it's mostly a background thought now.

I'm on meds, but not meds that would make me feel this way. It's a really tame antidepressant, at a fairly low dose. I'm not looking into changing it at the moment because I've been through easily 15 or 20 different meds, and most have just made me miserable. I take pills to sleep at night, because otherwise I can't.

Everything is so boring and worthless, and I don't really have any idea what to do about it. I feel like I'm on autopilot, kind of. A little like living in third person. I wish things could be better, less monotonous, because time feels like it's going by so quickly. I'm not going to be a teenager for much longer, and I feel like I've missed out on a lot already.

I'd love advice, tips, suggestions, stories, or stuff like that, if you have any. I'm in the US. ",25Nov2017,1,

29,"5 people in my family including my grandmother and mother have been diagnosed with schizophrenia. I am 17 and after a talk with a couple of people I agrre that I should see a professional because I may be having symptoms. I don't believe in self diagnosis but I would feel better if someone qualified told me I'm okay or need treatment. But my parents do not trust doctors for the most part, and they think anyone like a psychiatrist or psychologist is just trying to scam people or crazy (no doubt one of my mother's symptoms but my dad is just really southern and uneducated). My mother also doesn't think she has a problem which is also due to her disorder. I have talked to them and they told me they would never send their children to any kind of mental health professional because they just try to take your money. I don't think there is a way to convince them so I'm hoping that when I turn 18 I can go myself. The things that I think to be symptoms are hearing things like music that is not there(I would ask people about music playing and they would tell me they hear nothing), feeling like people are staring at me, feeling like people are looking through me not at me when I talk to them, and what scares me worst is that I have heard 4 gunshots while in public places so I get scared, I drop to the ground looking to see what is happening but no one else is reacting to it, just staring at me. If my brothers are showing symptoms they won't say. ",25Nov2017,10,

36,"So, one day I finally did decide to call the National Suicide Prevention hotline partially because I wanted to see what it was actually like and partially because I was helpless and wanted to die. When you call, it's much different than what I at least expected, a person (the person that answered for me was a male) and he said his business and name and blah, then he told me ""so..."" And it was so awkward. I thought it would help, but I just ended the call because I didn't feel comfortable. Now that I know calling the suicide Prevention hotline isn't what I imagined...

38,"I recently had a heated argument with a rather unpleasant individual here on Reddit about some somewhat trivial matters, something that I'm sure happens all the time.

Problem is, the way he was speaking to me seemed like a personal attack, and he was calling me out as being wrong about this topic even though I can't see any way that I was wrong. I became very angry at him and I didn't show it much online, but in person I was absolutely fuming.

I even decided that I'd mess around with him just to piss him off but I decided against it, because I just didn't feel like bothering; however, I cannot get over how badly he aggravated me, and it's been making me think unkind thoughts (that I would NEVER act on) towards this individual.

I even tried some self harm to relieve the anger I had built up, and while it helped for a while, it didn't stay away. 

Does anyone have any advice for me?",25Nov2017,1,

More about the dream. I was on a holiday resort and was challenged to a boxing match. The person I was to fight pulled out and was replaced by a far more experienced fighter. Before the match I was nervous. I went to the mirror and noticed a bald patch I called my mum and looked back in the mirror to find that even more was gone. ",25Nov2017,1,

This is all moving so much faster than I expected and I don't feel prepared at all. I feel like my gp has over reacted a bit and that this isn't actually necessary. I don't want to waste anybody's time.

My main reason for posting is to see if anyone knows what I should expect from the appointment? Any information at all would be gratefully recieved! ",25Nov2017,3,

42,My mind is a lonely place because of the basic reasons anyone would feel like that. Unfortunately I actually do have a lot of physical loneliness. I have freinds. My best friend is at university and I see him every couple of weeks. My other friends work long and flexible hours. I work relatively normal hours with a full weekend off. So I barely get to hang around with my friends I have to drink alone and see who I see. And of course I could stay in but then I get extremely miserable. I have a a lot of acquaintances and I am forced to awkwardly hang around with them in order to not feel lonely. Of course I connect with some of these people but I wouldn't call them real good friends. ,25Nov2017,1,

44,"Hello, r/mentalhealth. This is my first time posting here, so I'm sorry in advance if I break any rules. This is an unusual situation, and I hope this is right place to put this. I just feel kind of lost.

I am a 17 year-old kid. I am a senior in high school. My entire life I've lived with my mom and her parents my entire life. My mom's dad is a very successful man, he's traveled the world, been the CEO of multiple companies in Canada, and (not to sound prude) is pretty rich. My mom and dad divorced right after I was born. My mom moved in with her parents in a verg wealthy neighborhood, and I've lived here my entire life. My mom and grandparents are very kind people, but have sheltered me my entire life. They've done everything for me, and I mean literally everything. They cook meals everyday for me, they clean for me, do my laundry, etc. I am very spoiled, but very lucky.

The reason I gave this lengthy backstory is because I believe I rely on my family, my mother especially, for way too much. I'm going to college soon and I'm scared that it's going to be a (for lack of a better term) culture shock. I'm afraid I won't know how to do anything, I'll be completely lost and expect everything to be done for when it isn't. I know I'm stuck-up. I know that I'm entitled. And I hate it, I absolutely hate it. I hate relying on people to things for me, but I don't know how else to act. I hope someone on this subreddit can help me out. 

Thank you,

45,"Last night, my girlfriend and I broke up because I am ""unable to express emotions properly."" When we split, she sobbed loudly yet I couldn't feel a thing. I really couldn't.

I've thought about my emotional responses to things lately and I have found that I usually *act out* my emotions instead of *expressing* them. This could be something I learned from my dad who represses his emotions constantly, and/or from my mom whose father was schizophrenic. 

I also remember when my grandma died and I didn't feel a thing either, even though she was a big part of my life.

Is this restricted affect? I'm not sure. I still have trouble feeling anything towards last night.",25Nov2017,1,

49,"* background: i live in canada, still in high school. no diagnoses yet. i've been prescribed lorazepam as a ""stopgap"" for panic attacks, but otherwise am not on any medication. not sure of my family's history of mental illness.

i've always had ""normal"" thoughts from anxiety and depression - however, those thoughts have intensified lately.

connections are starting to become visible between certain people in my school. i know that they want me to die, because i deserve it. whenever i overhear them talk, i know they're communicating in code, no matter how innocuous the topic. i get ""sent"" compulsions to hurt myself when one of them makes eye contact with me. that kind of thing.

i know this is irrational to feel and think, especially since they haven't actually done anything to me in the past (or vice versa), but that doesn't help. i've been referred to a psychiatrist. but i'm getting increasingly dysfunctional in between now and the appointment. i'm afraid that they might give me the command to die or hurt myself severely and i won't be able to stop myself.

how can i deal with it in the meantime? should i hospitalize myself or try to hold out until the appointment? ",25Nov2017,1,
