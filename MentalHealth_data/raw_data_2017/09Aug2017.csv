1,"I’m participating in the RBC Race for the Kids Toronto (Ontario, Canada) to support youth mental health. 

As many as two million young people in Canada are struggling with mental health issues such as an anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, depression or addiction; yet only one in five will get specialized treatment. This is largely because families don’t know where to turn to find the services their children need.  

By sponsoring my run, you are helping youth find the right mental health support they need, when they need it most.

7,"This is rambley, lacks a lot of grammar and is long but hopefully explains a lot (I'm in the UK if that's important) I'm getting this down partly cause I know I won't remember it later which is a major problem for me right now is the clearest my memories have been in a long time.  I'm pretty sure I have a mental illness of some sort but I haven't been able to talk to a doctor yet because every time i try it just causes me to doubt whether it's real maybe I'm just an ass maybe it's not as bad as I'm making it out maybe I'm overreacting. I have problems communicating properly when I say things I something's realise I didn't say it right or I missed anything out but I don't want to change what i said in case it seems I made it all up or I'm just lying. My default thought on what is wrong is bipolar disorder as my mum had it and according to my brother so does both he but he's been pathological liar since he knew how to talk so grains of salt are needed for that. And to lying I also have a problem with this sometimes I'll lie and won't know why( before you ask to the best of my knowledge everything I've said and will say is accurate but I understand if grains of salt are needed)  or I'll lie just so I don't have to all for help but won't help myself. Back to bipolar disorder  I'm certain about depression once you have suicidal thoughts that's pretty easy to pin but the mania is hard is what I'm feeling just me not depressed or something more  reading it seems to suggests I should lack the self hatred but I'm pretty sure I still hate myself, less than when I feel depressed but it's still there. I can't pin down a period and say I'm certain they'd be mania. I have what I would call an attachment problem. I went through a period of heavy drinking which seemed fine at the time until someone pointed out that they'd never seen me not drinking ( this guy was a drug addict so ready more salt) but after that I decided to stop drinking I've occasionally since then had a drink but never excessive. The worst incident was when I decided to stay up all night drinking and playing quiplash with people on twitch. I am way too attached to my phone if I don't have music playing I feel worse and I feel paranoid the paranoid feeling I have anyway but the music seems to help it a little. I'm feeling more coherent as I write this. I went through a period a while ago where I decided if i stayed in people's lives I'd end up hurting them so I said goodbye to a friend who I talked a lot and ended all communication with everyone who couldn't force contact. I destroyed one close friend with someone I still care a great deal about with this they helped pull me out a little but it wasn't enough and explaining everything at that time felt impossible so too soon after when they cause me to see a conflict I was avoiding so I withdrew from them again I don't see how I can fix that I am still myself I'll probably do all this again and at the end of the day in still an ass. I also have dyspraxia diagnosed so could that be a factor to what's  happening maybe who really knows when it comes to the human brain.  I  think this could do with editing but I don't want to lose the meaning so I'm gonna keep it the same for now at least. I'm defiantly gonna share this around so people can maybe understand what's happening with me.",09Aug2017,2
8,"My mother has lived with severe depression for as long as I remember. i recently got married, and mother went off of her meds about two weeks before. During that time, made me feel completely unloved by her with negative comments and withdrawal from me. 

These feelings took me back to feelings of periods of my childhood and adolescence when I felt unloved and rejected by my mother. Upon thinking about it and talking with my sister, I realized that these periods were times when my mother was off of meds. Otherwise, she was a wonderful and loving mother. 

I realize now, at the age of 30, that is was my morher's depression that caused her negative treatment of me at points during my childhood and adolescence. I've made a conscious effort, as long as I can remember, to tread carefully around my mother, as not to upset her. When she's that dead kind of cold towards me, it hurts me to my core like no one else has ever made me feel. It turns me into my 6 year old self. 

I live with depression, as well. I've dealt with eating issues and self-harm in the past, as well as hopelessness, lack of energy, etc. still at times. I wonder if this is a result of genetics, upbringing, or a combination. 

My husband and I want to have a family. I'm hesitant to procreate because I don't want to pass this on to anyone else. I don't want any other human to have to feel they ways that I've felt and watched my mother feel at times in my life. However, I also am fortunate enough to know that life is sometimes immensely beautiful, and that is a feeling that needs to be passed on. 

Is depression genetic, excentuated by upbringing, some combination? Is there anything to do to help ensure that future offspring won't have to live with it?",09Aug2017,3

10,"I apologize for rambling but I'm writing this minutes after experiencing the worst panic attack of my life. Any encouraging words would sincerely be appreciated because I feel like crap after this... So I'm cleaning my apartment. I've been cleaning for around 20 minutes when I notice my nose getting stuffy to the point that I must breath out of my mouth. I feel a sense of doom beginning to wash over me. I remind myself that the congestion is only allergies, take an antihistimine, and continue cleaning. My symptoms aren't improving and within five minutes my mind has gone from allergies to death. I truly believed that I was dying and that this was neither allergies or a panic attack. I slouch in bed, obsessively using nose spray trying to get the stuffy feeling out of my nose and throat. Even though that decongests me some, I still feel as though I can't breath. I feel hot all over and can literally feel sweat dripping from my under arms. I'm desperately trying to get air by hacking but there doesn't seem to be any congestion in my airway yet it feels as if there is. My limbs begin to tingle and grow cold, my heart is racing, my pupil dilate and all I can think is this is it. I'm going to die and I'm so afraid. Will it hurt? Will I struggle for long? Is this my fault? Could I have prevented this? Am I going to hell? Will I ever see my friends and family again? I feel its important to add here that I am very unsure about what religion I identify with. I was raised in a Christian household, but really wrestle with questions regarding that faith and all other faiths honestly. I do believe there is a God. So at this point, with all these thoughts swarming around in my head, I decided I either need to go to the ER or call my mother. I am a college student that lives alone. It's around midnight and I feel terrible because I know my mother is asleep but my fingers automatically hit her name and the phone rings. Thank God she answers. I tell her whats going on with me, I talk to her almost normally as though nothing is wrong and apologize over and over. I tell her I think I'm having a panic attack but I'm not sure. We talked for 20 minutes and honestly that was the longest 20 minutes of my life. Usually when I call someone I calm down, but the feeling of not being able to breath continues. My legs are convulsing and shaking. I ask her if I could have asthma? She says no. It's also important to add that I'm very much a hypochondriac. Finally, we say goodnight although the panic has not completely subsided but I know she's tired. So here I am now typing this novel and I'm finally feeling some peace but am also afraid of it returning. Maybe not tonight, but another day... another day when I'm around friends... what would they think of me? I'm so afraid of losing my friends due to this. Will people think I'm crazy? I also worry that I'll never be able to have a relationship due to this. Like I'm just too messed up for anyone to love me and for the first time in my life I don't want a relationship and I feel like its my anxiety making me feel this way. My previous relationship was both physically and mentally abusive. Any tips, advice, or kind words would mean the world. Thank you friends.",09Aug2017,4

16,"Hey guys and girls. So, I will not be going into this too deep, but I'm 16 years old and whenever I talk to my mom, she is trying to prove some kind of argument or point, and literally at the end of every social encounter with my mother I feel so much anger and rage, that I don't show at all when I'm around her, that when I walk away I punch a wall as hard as I can. If the conversation was particularly aggravating, I punch multiple times until my knuckles are red/bleeding. Sometimes it helps me to grab objects and pummel them into the wood in the wall, but then I feel awful after because I'm usually still slightly angry and I slightly ruined the wall... anyways I just want to know what your guys opinions are on all of this.

18,"I have a pretty specific confusion related to receiving treatment in the form of therapy and psychiatric medication.
Ideally, I would like to see someone who does both the prescription of medication and therapy (CBT) but it seems like that would be unlikely. To put this into a question, is it common that psychiatrist will perform therapy or do I need to see a therapist and have them recommend a psychiatrist? Is it common for a therapist to work with a psychiatrist? If medication, as I feel, is desperately needed is it best to go to a psychiatrist and follow their recommendation or follow the therapy route first?
I am just not sure who to see first/what would be the best route.

20,"I'm not sure which sub this belongs in but just needed to get it off my chest. I'm on holiday with my extended family and feeling incredibly crappy. It started off well enough, but things that my family have done all my life are now too much to bear. Idk why but I thought things would be different once I was an adult. 

During meals they comment constantly on my body and how little I'm eating. This makes me more anxious and further reduces my appetite. 

Additionally, one side of the family bickers incessantly, any conversation is minutes away from an argument.

One family member in particular doesn't like the way I live - v. different to the cultural norms and interrupted a conversation I was having with my mother by slamming their  hands on the dinner table and yelling that I don't understand anything about our culture.

When I first met my other half, I knew very quickly that he was ""the one"". We get on incredibly well, he's amazing and supportive and we always have fun together. When I look at him, I see my future.. pets, house, our family, the whole lot.

I moved into his house after we had been dating for a year and I've been living here for a couple of months now (and basically lived here anyway before he officially asked me to move in). Recently, things seemed a little off. We weren't our usual selves but he always insisted he was fine.. until last night.

He finally broke down and told me he couldn't bare to live with me, he NEEDS time alone and me being in a different room doesn't feel like enough space. Not that he feels like he needs to be apart form from me but that being in the same house with me full-time is actually stressing him out massively and making him angry / want to lash out. He said it's nothing to do with my stuff or me but more a person being there all the time.

Apart from his family, I am the first person he has lived with and since leaving his family home, he's been by himself for a couple of years. He's suffered from depression in the past and I'm not sure if this may be part of it, as we're going through some money troubles at the moment (since leaving university in May, I have been unable to permanent, full-time find work to help pay the bills).

He has asked me to move out and I'm unsure what will happen to us. He tells me he still completely loves me and is so scared of losing me but I'm unsure if there's a future for us if he cannot bare to live with me full time. I love him, with all my heart, and the thought of losing him and our amazing relationship is killing me.

Too many activities tire me to the point I want to sleep all day. I don't have any motivation to follow my goals throughout the day and I'm having a hard time concentrating and being interested in a subject that I would otherwise like. As soon as it gets hard or a little boring, I feel worned down and tired and I feel like sleeping.

31," Hello! Thanks for clicking on here. So, guess you are wondering about the slightly unusual name and title? Yup. Thought so. 

 It all started when I became a teen. From age 13, I struggled with severe clinical depression. This developed in to anxiety later on and I was finally diagnosed under CAMHs when I was 18. Since then it has been suggested that I may also have borderline personality disorder. Between the ages of 13 and 21, I've seen more professionals than I've had hot dinners and popped a few pills alongside. 

 Blah blah I know, you don't want to hear my first world sob story...you want to know why I'm called Dobby. Basically, I became seriously physically ill whilst volunteering in Malawi aged 19. I was meant to be there 10 months and only lasted about 2/3 weeks (pathetic, I know lol). When I came back, I was the lowest of the low. I would grovel to my parents, worry about money, feel like a massive burden, say I didn't deserve anything and act like they were my masters; asking for instructions and chores to do. One day, my mum said 'God, you're like Dobby the House elf! We need to give you a sock!' and it caught on from there. They would then also ask where my sock was if they felt I was a bit low. I can occasionally get 'high' (as in excitable and fidgety) so they would ask then as well. I would reply either 'pulled up to the knee' or 'falling off my toe' or somewhere in between. It was a good, coded way to ask how I was without it being too obvious. They could ask me in public or in front of friends who didn't know and would know what to do to help. I'm really lucky to have such a supportive family. 

 I'm also aware this isn't an entirely unique situation as it seems mental health problems have become an epidemic, but I wanted to reach out to those who are still struggling. I still struggle myself from time to time, but as cringey as it sounds... there is a light at the end of the tunnel. You cannot be a warrior without a war. 
 
 I got the idea of starting this as I have recently had a few friends and acquaintances who have asked me for some advice. Due to my extensive experience in therapy and counselling, I have a fair few strategies up my house elf sleeve. A few people who reached out to me said my suggestions have been really helpful. if I could reach out to one more person who finds this helpful, then job done. I'm not an expert, these suggestions are just drawn from my own experiences and close friends/family experiences. Sometimes I might use my GCSE and A Level in Psychology but please do not think I'm Dumbledore. I'm am just a lowly house elf and you will not be cured over night. Don't worry, it won't all be doom and gloom. There are a fair few funny stories along the way as well. 

Thanks for reading my first entry! I hope you carry on reading and join me on the journey of writing my first blog. (I won't be offended if you point out any grammatical errors etc.... there are probably quite a few.)

35,"Hello! Dobby again. I'm ready with my sock tightly fisted in my hand ready to tackle the dreaded panic attacks. 

If you have ever had one, you know how bad and unpredictable they can be. I remember my first one... I was with my family aged around 14/15 in the Shepherds Bush Westfields. It wasn't too intense but I felt like I was in a bubble, separated from the rest of the public and unable to breathe. A very weird sensation and makes you feel like you aren't real. I now know this to be called disassociation or derealisation (phew, long words that are hard to spell). I had this quite regularly afterwards, along with sometimes seeing faces and monsters when I shut my eyes and very occasionally I would have delusions. My most intense would make me feel like I was dying. I would feel this sense on impending doom and time would go elastic with thoughts rushing through my mind. I would feel pain in my chest and go numb all over with a dry mouth and feeling completely detached and in real. 

Anyway. Enough about me. I'm pretty sure if you have had one, you can identify with that... and if you haven't... you don't want one. Trust me. :) 

Dobby knows panic attacks is a tough one. Different things work for different people. I'll list down some suggestions that helped me. Bear with me, I know some you have heard all the time and are very hard to do. 

1) BREATHE! - Yup. You guessed it. I'm not straying from the obvious or cliché, but stay with me on this one. Almost every panic attack makes you feel like you can't breathe. But you can. There is nothing physically stopping you. Panic attacks are all in the mind folks and it is a natural reaction. (Apologies for cliché again.) So what is a very powerful weapon that we have that we can use to trick us in to stop panicking? Yup, the mind again! Put all of your energy and focus you have left in to breathing. Try and do 7 seconds in and 11 seconds out, If you can't do that just make sure you are breathing out for longer than you are breathing in. DO NOT do short sharp breaths. It has something to do with science and carbon dioxide being acidic which causes acidosis which causes hyperventilation which causes panicking *breathes* (see? everyone forgets to breathe). The more you hyperventilate, the more carbon dioxide enters your lungs and the more epinephrine (adrenaline) and cortisol your body creates, causing the panic attack to last longer. I'm not saying it is as easy as 1 2 3, but it will help you a great deal if you focus on your breathing as much as you can. 

2) YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DIE. Still not straying away from the cliché I'm afraid, but there is a reason. Drawing on what I've mentioned before, panic attacks have looong been in our natural reactions to stressful stimuli. It is a natural, evolutionary reaction that was helpful to the cave men and women for the 'fight or flight' reaction. It still helps us to this day (ever heard of people being able to lift up cars after an car accident?) but not all the time. It's a blessing and curse. Although it can feel like a lifetime, panic attacks also usually only last 10 minutes and rarely go beyond 20/30 minutes. They are caused by a surge in the delightful hormones cortisol and epinephrine (adrenaline) but HAVE NO ADVERSE SIDE AFFECTS ON YOUR HEALTH. Remember this people. Panic attacks come and go. 

3) BE KIND TO YOURSELF. You may think panic attacks are embarrassing, but a lot of people identify with how you are feeling. In the UK, two thirds of people have experienced MH issues and a quarter have experienced panic attacks. A QUARTER. Imagine you are someone you care about and what you would do to help them or imagine that person is there and what they would say. Do whatever it takes to calm you down. Could be hanging upside down whilst singing ghost busters... it really doesn't matter. Don't give any notice to anyone else, you are what is important. To help others around you and stop them worrying, you have to put yourself first. 

4) F&*@ WHAT PEOPLE THINK. Again, drawing on before. A lot of people's anxiety is caused by worrying what others think of them so this is a difficult one. People may be dismissive of you, not care or ask insensitive questions... but the majority of people will be concerned and want to help. Those are the people who matter. People aren't worth the mind space if they are d*cks. Most of the time, the d*cks haven't experienced panic attacks and don't want to try to understand. It isn't whether they understand or not, the important thing is whether they try to. Like I said previously, you are number one. Before you can do anything else, you need to calm down and to do that you make yourself priority. Every human is equal, but we are individual. Instead of anxiety, those d*cks might have anger issues or an obsession with cuddly bears that they need help with. We need to with an equal level of respect and care. INCLUDING OURSELVES. 

5) TAKE NOTE OF THE TRIGGERS. This is an important one. Try to remember what is the main trigger of the panic attack so you can avoid the trigger next time or deal with it differently. You may think it could be a multitude of things or just thoughts but the likelihood is that there was a particular thought or occurrence that started it. This is another difficult one because panic attacks are unpredictable and sometimes come out of the blue or are delayed. If you really can't think of one, don't worry yourself in to another panic attack. It could be a random one. Just try to make yourself aware so you can help your recovery. 

6) DO SOMETHING MUTLEY. (I hope you get that reference...) When you have regulated your breathing, find something to do that you can focus on to stop going in to another panic session. This can be anything from drinking cold water and feeling it go down your throat to colouring to fighting the dark lord (I, as Dobby, sincerely encourage this one). This helps to block out any thoughts and feelings that might be left over from the panic attack. I also keep a hair band/bracelet on my wrist that I ping when I experience derealisation or dissociation. This helps me to know that I am real and there. It can also help you focus on something else. Don't do it too hard though!!

7) YOU NEED TO GET SOME HELP. That isn't meant in a mean way. My turning point in my anxiety was when I started going to an anxiety support group. It opened my eyes to the different people of all ages and backgrounds who suffered with it and helped to make me not feel as alone. They gave tips and support on panic attacks and everyone felt comfortable (but not pressured) to share their experiences and suggestions with the rest of the group. We had a pact not to share the experiences or names outside of the group and if we saw someone in town to just wave and not stop and chat. The healing was kept in the room to separate it from our personal lives. There was one man who used to run a very successful restaurant and knew a lot of celebrities but had to quit due to his anxieties, a security guard, a couple of nurses, a man recently diagnosed with Parkinson's, a student, an unemployed man and a social worker. They really were from different backgrounds! But we were all open and accepted as ourselves. We were all on an equal level and it helped me a lot. 

Sorry this has been sooo long. I hope it helps a bit.

I'm (23f) talking about family therapy. I went to seek help because I cut myself seriously (for my standards) and were afraid. I have some issues, and some of them comes from my family. I live with my mother and grandmother, have older brother and older sister. But I don't like my family. At home we never hug or touch and we barely talk. I spend most of my times reading/on my computer, in my room. 

To sum it, I have a bad/no-existing relation with my closest family. The psychologist I saw said I should start family therapy. But that's a last thing I would like to do in life. I dream one day I will have enough money to get my own place, so I'll spend less and less time with my family. 


But I still have my issues and maybe I should get some professional help - yet I'm ""scared"" they all will advice family therapy and that's a ""deal breaker"" for me.

52,"Despite taking loads of different pills and seeking professional help i still feel like a useless piece of shit that needs to suffer for not being good at anything and so i keep hitting myself on my head and legs whenever im alone so no one can stop me, at the same time i keep worrying if im doing this just to get attention while i push everyone away and ignore everyone that tries to talk to me except my SO, is that feeling normal? What can i do to stop myself and control myself i dont know what to do anymore i just want to hurt myself more and more.",09Aug2017,2
53,"so crying, im just so confused. I am a 14 year old girl. I have had suicidal thoughts and all of that before, and I've been through a lot. My last suicide attempt was 4 months ago. I thought everything was going to be better.

Today I was just playing on my phone, and my little 3 year old brother came and sat next to me. I noticed his hands had become purple, and i immediately knew it was nailpolish. I went upstairs and it turned out he went to me and my sisters' room and broke a bunch of things, and spilled nailpolish all over my sisters' bed. 

I got mad because I had told him before not to go into our rooms, but he did it anyway. But what can you expect from a 3 year old? 

I went downstairs, told my mom what happened and she just laughed it off and said: ""what am i supposed to do, throw him away?"".

Later on wanted to play some games on my playstation, when i noticed my brother was trying to break my headphones. Without thinking i just put down the controller and pushed his face down into my parents' bed (thats where the ps is). He started screaming but I wasnt thinking and kept pushing his face into the bed. 

Then i heard my mom screaming and asking what the hell i was doing. It was like i was in some sort of trance... I just let my brother go and said nothing. 

After that i just felt stupid. My mom thought that it was just one of the dangerous games i like to play with him (i sometimes turn him upside down but not to intentionally hurt him). 

I love my brother too, and i cant imagine what it would be like with him gone, but i just dont understand why i did it... Now im starting to think that if i wasnt born, this wouldnt have happened. All of that therapy for nothing. 4 attempts in total. I dont understand myself anymore.

Im writing this in my room right now, im surprised they didnt punish me yet. What should i do. I hate myself. I dont have any friends left...

I might as well just be gone.",09Aug2017,4
54,"Hi there, hope all is well!

Little bit about myself: I am a 19 year old male, sophomore in college. Currently living with my family in my hometown, but I head back to college in a few weeks.

I had visited a therapist (courtesy of my healthcare provider) just once about a year and a half ago, but other than that I had never been seen by a professional until today. I was seen for about an hour and the therapist told me that I most likely have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, but that I would need to be seen more to really lock that in. She had recommended that I continue with therapy at the location where my college is, instead of having to commute back home for each session. Even though this was a very short meeting and the first in a while, I feel that the rough diagnosis I received does not cover all of the issues I have been experiencing. Has anyone ever felt this way? And if so, how did you go about it? ",09Aug2017,1
55,"When I am upset, I want to talk about the upset intermittently through the day, weeks, months, until it is over.  It is at the forefront of my thoughts and it is bothering me and then I want to repeat my story.  I don't think it is obsessive, but some of the people in my immediate family don't want to hear about it over and over.  How do I know how much I can expect from my SO?  I am repeatedly disappointed and hurt because I am in pain and I can tell he doesn't want to hear it again.",09Aug2017,2
56,"I used to be part of one on Twitter. We were big but tight-knit, so most people didn't pay us any mind. It was nice that that support structure was there. Does anyone know if stuff like that still exists? I'm given to understand that the one on Twitter got kinda big and less intimate and now it's not really a thing people go to for support...",09Aug2017,5
57,"So, I'm an unmedicated bipolar (type 2 I believe, I've been off meds/any treatment for 3 years & diagnosed for 4. I have had very bad experiences with the psychiatrist i went to and I went to a therapist one time who totally made me too uncomfortable to want to see another psychiatrist. It may have been because he was a juvenile therapist, and wouldn't even listen to me. I can't really remember. I have MANY ups and downs. It puts stress on my relationship, which just adds to the stress of my job. I'm a waitress. Today I had a table of 2 women and 6 small children. They were very rude, talked down to me, acted as if I wasn't even a person, kept putting their dirty dishes on the only other open table in my section, and then they complained for a fake bullshit reason (manager even agreed) and got half of their food free. Then they left me a HUGE mess and not a cent of a tip. I usually can handle this type of thing but they were firing me up from the second they got into their seats. I know how to do my job and I am very nice, I receive a LOT of compliments. (as long as I'm in a good mood) I have worked this job for over a year, and I just got put on day shift (which means you proved yourself) and you can make so much more money. After I saw there was no tip, I saw them out the window smoking at their cars. The whole place is windows, so you can totally see everything. But I tried to stand behind a car as I stood there and DEATH STARRED them while smoking a cigarette ON THE CLOCK OUT FRONT OF THE BUILDING.  Then as they drove away I stood there and literally sassy waved at them while they drove away. I also flicked them off when they were smoking but I don't think they saw me. My manager closed the blinds & even called the GM to tell him what was happening. Point of the story is, they know I'm bipolar and they usually work with me the best they can (like I said, I'm a pain in the ass.. I have a lot of problems, I constantly embarrass myself, I lose grip and cry  like a baby atleast once a week ...) & I literally work through the tears the best I can. I greet and wait on tables with tears in my eyes until I can finally force them away. People always think I'm nuts. My boyfriend thinks I'm nuts too. 


The point of this is, that I have never done anything like this to a customer. My head was spinning and I feel like I didn't even know what I was doing. Now I'm depressed & I hate myself. I'm gonna catch a bunch of shit from my GM tomorrow and if those ladies complain to corporate, i will literally get fired. I have a very strong feeling that that already have/are going to. I can't lose my job. All of the psychiatrists that accept my insurance have wait lists. 

 I don't know that to do. I need help. I. Can't. Do. This. ",09Aug2017,1
58,"I found out my work has a program where they give free therapy sessions with a licensed counselor (via some other provider- my work is a grocery store so it's not in-house lol). You either get three face-to-face or six over the phone sessions, then they re-evaluate and if you still need more help, you can get another set of free sessions and so on. 

I opted for the phone calls, and I just finished my third session a few minutes ago and despite the fact that I spent half of the hour sobbing over my mom and my grief, I feel so fucking good. 

I spent the last three years of my life just wishing I could have a therapist. I wanted a therapist so bad that I would talk to the walls and then pick apart my own words, because that's all I could afford. In reality, I've needed a therapist since I was 13 (I'm 23), but i only realized it after my first real suicide scare in 2014.

Today, after I spent 30 minutes crying and talking about my mom's alcoholism and her death, after I calmed down, she said, ""Kimberly, you did such a good job. You did so well at expressing your thoughts, and then stepping back and analyzing yourself and your emotions. You said you journal, so maybe it's all the years of doing that that's helped you be so good at self-reflection, but you're doing what it takes some people many, many sessions to be able to do.""

And then I told her it's because I was so desperate for a therapist that I would literally talk to myself and ramble until I suddenly said something new, something I never realized about my own situation until I said it. For instance, it was one of those ""sessions"" that made me realized I've been suffering from depression since I was 13. 

Anyway, I just wanted to share that I'm so pleased to finally have someone to talk to and also share:

1.) if you're too poor to afford mental health counseling, please look through your workplace. I don't mean google, because I googled to see if mine offered something like this before and found zilch. I actually had to go through my managers. I know that's scary but if you can do it, I recommend it.

2.) Talking to the walls can help??? I didn't know I was so advanced in my own mental health progress until she pointed it out. One thing that helped me: if an issue you have stems from a specific person, imagine going back in time to a specific point, confronting them, and then just fuckin do it. Out loud. Say the words. Don't think too hard about it. Just let it out. In my case I imagined multiple scenarios: confronting my mom in 2002, the year before she started drinking and then telling her exactly how it's going to fuck up my life. I imagined going to 2009 when she tried to kill herself, to 2012, the year she died. Telling her she's going to die, telling her I love her the way I forgot to tell her. 

It can feel fucking silly and I definitely recommend doing it when you're alone in your house or apartment or maybe in the car (though preferably not driving!!). But if that person or event or whatever really affected you, you're probably going to end up ranting and crying like I did, and potentially learning something new about yourself and your situation. Related, another good tip is to write that shit down once you figure it out. 

I wish you all the best. 🔆💜🔆",09Aug2017,5
