0,"I'm 15 I have social anxiety and depression from bullying for 3 years mainly about the way I look, I really enjoy social experiences and tell I would be an extrovert if I didn't have social anxiety but I daydream when I'm alone so much and so hard and during long breaks away from people I talk to in school I almost make up conversations in my head (crazy I know) cause I'm so lonely and I feel insane and crazy sometimes. Some family members tell me I have something wrong with me or that I'm a freak or nutcase, everyone in school (teachers) jokes and implies I'm an idiot alot. I'm terrified all this isolation will turn me out of my mind and into a killer or something though I have absolutely no want or desire to hurt someone, I just wanted friends but I'm so lonely and shy and I'm so stupid I can't do anything I want to kill myself cause I know my life will stay like this ",26Jul2017,2
1,"Some background -- I'm 32f and have been seeing my therapist, ""Susan,"" once a week for a little more than a year. I have anxiety and PTSD from some long-term bad situations in my past and when I first came to see her, I was doing really badly -- long-term unemployed, feeling intense anxiety every day, afraid to take any steps to improve my situation, and low-key suicidal. With her help, I've made a lot of improvement since then. I still have anxiety attacks sometimes and get triggered by certain situations, but I have made very real improvements in my situation and my confidence and enjoyment of life have increased a lot. People around me have commented on the difference and how much happier I seem.

Susan is an older woman, probably 70-ish, and very kind and understanding. She practices CBT and EMDR and always tells me that I'm the one doing the real work of healing myself. Even though she's my mom's age and is kind of motherly, I have felt comfortable talking to her about personal things in my life, including sex and sexual abuse, that I've never been able to talk about easily. She has been clear about boundaries and politely evades or shuts down any questions I ask about her that might veer into too personal -- for instance, when I asked during the winter holidays what she celebrates, she smiled and said ""life.""

For the next couple of weeks, Susan has to be out of town for a (happy) family event. We have missed weeks before, but usually because I was traveling or had something going on, and never two weeks in a row. During our session today, she told me that I could call her if there was an emergency while she was out of town, and if I had a crisis I could make an appointment with her colleague at the same practice. I said jokingly that I wasn't planning on having a crisis, but I appreciate it. I have a friend who needed an emergency therapy appointment recently after losing a beloved pet, so I understand that things can happen.

Then about an hour after I left the appointment, I was spending some time with my mom and I got a call on my cell phone from Susan. She wanted to make sure I had her number and reassure me that I could call or text at any time and that she wouldn't have an away message recorded or anything. I thanked her and told her that I think I can manage not interrupting her trip, but I appreciate it. When I hung up the phone and told my mom what it was about, she said ""aww, she loves you,"" which made me feel a little awkward because obviously she doesn't ""love"" me, that's not what therapists do, but I am worried that she seems so preoccupied about me. 

While I had some bad anxiety over the past couple of weeks due to a triggering incident, I think I'm pretty okay. It's been a long time since I've felt suicidal or like I was in a serious emotional crisis. I don't want Susan to feel like I'm this fragile creature who might fall apart if she doesn't worry about me for two weeks while she's with her family -- that doesn't seem like a healthy boundary to me.

My partner says I'm overthinking this and her concern is totally normal. IDK. What do you think?",26Jul2017,2
5,"I am 19 and have been diagnosed with ADHD, Antisocial personality disorder, and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Most of my life I don't have much if any distress. In fact I think I experience significantly less negative emotionality (except for rageful explosions from time to time) than most people do. However, whenever I start to have a relationship with a female, I get very emotional (in a bad way) and paranoid, and I walk around pretty much constantly angry flying off the handle at every small infraction I have to deal with.

Had a really bad day today (some stressful stuff) and I got so frustrated I just downed the rest of the pills I have.

I'll be perfectly fine for one moment, but then something will upset me and I'll be super sad. VERY SAD. Like I'll cry and think about self harming myself (I havent in a while, but I'll think about it) even if it was something minor. This will last for a few minutes, about up to half an hour at the longest, and then I'll be back to regular. OR something will bother me and I'll get really pissed.

One is of the past saying, ""Hey, lets think of everything that went wrong or caused anxiety in the past."" 

Then another is like, ""Hey, let's think of every little thing that causes fear, anxiety and hopelessness right now.""

The last is probably the worst. It tells me, ""You are worthless and won't amount to anything. The future for you is so hopeless so why even try. Why even try to slog through the days, they are all the same. Hey, I know what would bring relief, relief from the torment of all of us. Look there is the source of your relief, why don't you just do it. Why don't you just die.""

17,"Heya
To start off, I'm a 19 turning 20 soon (Already gonna get responses saying ""move out!"", or ""respect your parents rules"") Well to put it this way, I don't respect ""half"" of my parent's rules. I think they're too strict or just dumb under my liking, and like most new adults, I want to move out and start out my own rules and live independently and peacefully, and I don't have a healthy budget to take care of myself in an apartment. But that's not the main problem here.
Ever since last year when I got my job, I've became more aware of my parents actions and how they portray themselves towards me and my brother. First off, let's start with my mother. She's been known to be giggly and happy and caring like a good mother should be, but dear god, press her nerves and she goes absolutely nuts. Her main attacks are always gonna be shaming and trying her best to put you down miserably, and for me, I absolutely despise that way of parenting, you shouldn't ever shame your kids. She'll even shame or thrash if I just wanted to bugger off away from her just to find my friends, and she'll text or swear at me how I ""don't want to be part of the family"" or sarcastically I'm ""being supportive for the family for not being with them"", when I simply do not mean to do, and quite simply don't give a s*** as well. Other moments before I've got into my job (The military reserves) when I actually didn't want to enroll myself in, she would relate me to my drug-addict uncle whom is not doing so well, which is a weak and stupid comparison when I know doing drugs from the street are wrong and unhealthy on my standards. Now I'm in the military part time, and my god I won't forgive her. (Don't get me wrong, I love the job, just can't move on with her shaming antics). There will be moments where we both go on a hostile rant, and she'll try to be the victim where ""I'm not behaving like an adult"", when that makes me laugh, cause I can't see how swearing in public towards me, shaming and ranting is adult like? At the end of the argument, I'll admit my wrong doings and my behavior, but I will not apologize (which I've said to her and she compared me to a sociopath which is an unbelievable dumb comparison), because I've acted out for a reason and it isn't my fault I acted out like that. I do remember briefly that one day my mother and I drove off up to a small town which was an hour away from where we lived, and we both listened to a radio station called ""the secret"", narrated by a spokeswoman mentioning how shaming doesn't progress a child out well in the future, in fact, scars them from being out and open of possibilities out there, and both of us we're on board with it along the trip. Now.... Looking at my mother, nothing has changed. I'm pretty sure there's more to this from my past memories involving my mother, but from my confirmations, all I get was ""your just making this up hun"", and sarcastically ""Oh we know, you have a troubled struggling childhood, we all know"".
Now my dad. Okay sometimes he can be manageable to deal with. But there are days where he needs to chill out. He does have a short temper so you can easily p*** him off. But what really bothers me about him is the fact that he thinks he owns everything, including my room when It's actually my own private space. Look, I get it he bought that house, but I'm not taking that excuse so that he can walk into my room whenever he feels like it. I do things that I don't want to be caught doing, we can all be honest on that one. I take privacy and personal space very seriously, even for others. He is at least the authoritative figure of the family, but I don't need that in my life, I just want some support, that's really all I need. I mean back then he was pretty supportive when I was self harming myself when I was 15 (my mother flipped out lol). But nowadays, he (including my mother) seems to oppose most of the things I stand by which makes me reluctant to trust him for bringing up conversations or support that I need. Another thing that I do not fairly like is his lack of understanding. I mean, he was raised in a different area with little income in his family, so I can see why he wouldn't understand the current ""spoiled"" life I'm having right now, but I would love it if he just tries. Cause that lack of understanding can go so far where his past life no longer relates to what his life is right now. Now mostly before work, I bring my breakfast in when really I have 30 minutes to spare staying at home. However, he would tell me I have enough time to eat my breakfast when I don't want to yet, I want to eat it at work cause I think that's most efficient rather than eat at home, wash the dishes afterwards and rush out and drive off to work, like I don't need that anxiety in my life no more, plus I got the glorious time to eat and do whatever before hours. Further on, he'll presume to call me a ""princess"", just cause I don't want to eat in front of everyone like the family which is a completely dumb comparison. But in all honesty, I just want to get away from my parents. 
Now I do know I'm growing and increasingly itching for independence and personal space. I kinda wish I've joined the military early on in 16, I would've absolutely moved out and spread my wings earlier. However, that choice is slim since I've joined when I was 18. So really, all I wanted from my parents is actually personal space and respect for who I am, and I'm not getting either of those. Both of them do drive me insane, even most times they drive me to depression and anxiety. It's getting a bit more frantic now where I absolutely want to stick a knife into my throat and escape the misery, and possibly resort back to self harm. I've been clean from that for a few years now and I know it's unhealthy mentally, but I can't think of any way of coping this mentality of destruction and losing my sanity. I would love a 2 month vacation away from them. I do understand there’s a generation gap between me and them, but I’m not taking that as an excuse for anything. Call me heartless, but I know when enough is enough!

18,"USA, Florida. I've had a migraine for 6 days now. It has been two days, a four hour break, then three days in a row.

19,"Hi there. I'm a 26 year old male who up til now has had no mental health issues besides some irrational fears, a kind of 'walking' depression and some very minor OCD, as well as being admittedly over-empathetic. I now have dealt with extreme Pure OCD (Harm and Relationship) increased depression, crushing anxiety and existential worry. This was all brought on 1.7 months ago by a single event. The nature of it is confusing and worrying me, and I'd like to get some insight.




For a few weeks my general frustration/anger had been building. I found myself, as silly as it sounds, acting more cruel in video games, which felt cathartic (which in turn worried me). One day I was watching a music video with a female singer. I was enjoying the music, but I felt uneasy. I suddenly had an extremely sexually violent intrusive thought about her, which on some level also felt cathartic. I was *revolted* by both this and my reaction to it. It went against everything I am naturally and believe in. This flung me into the attack. I was flush with heat, and what I perceived as anger. My heartbeat went insane, my chest tightened and I felt 'out of body', like I was two people; one in the body/mind, one in spirit. I walked around, looked myself in the mirror telling myself to calm the hell down, asking what was going on. I decided to ignore it and began playing a game - I could feel myself trying to break the controller subconsciously. I was in the house alone with my dog, and specifically distanced myself from her and worried that I was going crazy and I'd snap, harming her or taking it out on her. It calmed down after about 15 minutes, but in it's wake it's left me with all these problems. The OCD has been exceptionally bad, because of this weird anger, it makes it feel more real. Now whenever I look at my wife or dog, I feel anxious and frustrated. I'm terrified I'm 'changed' as a person, or something.




Can anyone explain to me what's gone on here? I'm feeling very alone about this specific event and haven't really spoken about it, just saying I had an attack of some kind. It's causing me a great deal of distress.",26Jul2017,1
20,"Hi everyone,

I hope you're ok with me posting this here. I've also posted on the depression subreddit, so sorry to those of you who might see this twice.

I have recently finished my PhD at Royal Holloway University of London, and I'm looking for some people with anxiety and/or depression to answer some questions about their emotions and how they deal with them.

The survey takes around 20 minutes to complete and is completely anonymous and confidential.

We hope that by understanding how people with depression/anxiety process their emotions, we can improve treatment.

If you have any questions, my email address can be found at the link.

You can take part here:

22,"Whenever some random memories (mostly embarrassing) from secodary school and high school appear in my head, I get some kind of wierd twitches. Most common ones:

* short, intense hand shaking

* grims on my face, teeth clenching, closing eyes very hard

* smashing my hand on the table or my leg

* my whole body shakes

* making quiet moans, groans

* pulling my head far back

I can't control those, even as I am writting it right now and think about those memories, the twitches happen, unless I focus heavily on fighting them. They usually last like a second, then I realise what I'm doing and stop it.

Sometimes those memories appear randomly, for no real reason, sometimes I think about stuff and my mind just happens to wonder that way.

It started around a year ago, after finishing high school. Then I asked on 4chan (I know, not the best place) about it and many people said that similar things happen to them. That got me kind of relieved, I went to college and got into weed there. I don't know if that was the ""cure"" but those twitches stopped. Around a month ago my first year ended and I came back home. I have no access to weed here and those twitches came back, much stronger. There are days that they disappear for a whole day, but sometimes they happen a dozen or so times a day.

Should I be worried? What can it be? Should I meet with a specialist?

32,"When I was younger I stayed up way past my bedtime and a documentary about a serial killer came on. I was just really curious and somehow made it to the end. The man raped and killed over a dozen women. In the end, he was arrested. But it didn't end there, after a certain amount of time he was taken to this corridor by two cops, to a weird looking room that had a large sturdy wooden chair in the middle. 

The man was whimpering and sobbing as they strapped him into it. I thought the two men were just going to get a confession out of him. Then he was getting shocked and blood came pouring out of his head through the mask they put on. I was shocked myself. Then the man was dead and there was smoke like he was burned from the inside out. I cried and didn't sleep until many hours later.

I just accepted this as being a movie and not really a documentary but a movie that looks like a documentary. Until recently I found out that this apparently actually happens (I spoke to a friend about the movie, and how weird and messed up the ending was, they even made him shave his head. My friend said the movie was based on a true story.) , they take people and put them in this chair of death. And the cops and superintendent just watch coldly as the person dies right in front of them. I couldn't believe it. So I looked into it further.

There was a video where this superintendent was rehearsing to the cops about strapping a man into the chair so he could electrocute him. He didn't even seem remotely ashamed and made jokes about it towards the end. This stuff makes me feel legitimately physically sick and over the past few nights I've had nightmares about being strapped to a weird chair or bed and then he activates the machine and I'm shocked to death. I believe these people are somehow paid to do this and don't even get a slap on the wrist for murdering another human being in this death machine.

So I'm suffering pretty badly from depression and anxiety/social anxiety. Not on meds but seeking therapy which is due to start soon.

However, come around 8pm, it almost completely lifts. I want to say without fail, but I'm not sure it's always. However, the majority of the time, I get this switch and wonder what all the fuss was about. I get this sudden shift - I feel ***normal***.

56,"I've been reading people's stories on here and I though I'd throw mine into the mix.  It was (sort of) therapeutic to write.

Here are my good and bad parts...

The good!

- I'm kind of skinny and out of shape, but still healthy physically.  I try to eat right and take vitamins.
- I have a job that pays decent and have a good nest egg with no debt.
- I have a supportive (yet clueless) family and some close friends.  I have one really close friend who I feel comfortable talking openly.
- I'm still young: early 30s male.

The bad!

- I've had depression/anxiety issues for about the last ten years.  They started off small, almost unnoticeable, and just snowballed out of control.
- I think the crux of it is this:  I've never been in a serious relationship.  Just typing that out makes my skin crawl.
- I've been head-over-heals in love a few times but the women I was interested in weren't interested in me.  They've gotten married now and seem to have happy lives.  This makes me feel worse.
- The loneliness is unbearable.  It zapps all motivation to do anything.  It's even hard to smile sometimes.
- Not only that but people always think I'm angry or upset with them.  They don't know how exhausting it is to keep up appearances.  Feels like I've turned into a really unlikable person that now one wants to be around.  This also makes me feel worse. 
- I'm very introverted and totally fall apart in social situations.  Oddly, if it's work related (like a meeting or something) I do a lot better.  However, once things become more informal, forget it.  I can barely function.
- I still live with my family.  I help them out with bills and stuff since they live in a high COL area (but have a lower middle class income).  I keep telling myself I'm helping them out but I suspect I'm using that as an excuse.  
- It's hard to meet new people when you live at home.  I've tried explaining how I feel to them a few times but it hasn't gotten anywhere.  They say I should ""cheer up"".
- The only thing that helps me escape is my motorcycle.  When I feel down I go for a ride and, for a brief moment, I feel alive.  Sometimes it feels so good I sing in my helmet.  Of course, once I get back all that goes away.  I wish I could bottle up that feeling and carry it around with me wherever I go.

My plan!

- I haven't exercised in years even though everyone says it makes you feel better.  I will try to start running soon.  It won't be easy.
- I might see a therapist.  Have never sought out therapy and don't know where to start.  
- If I get my head in a better spot I'll be able to make better decisions and hopefully turn it around.

I'm also moody, lost most of my jobs by being an absolute wanker to customers and staff. But its ups and downs, I almost want to push people away to feel like whatever the issue its my fault. I want to feel like I fail. 

Why am I doing this? 

I've just lived in an amazing house and made some amazing friends, now im pushing them so much some probably wont talk to me again. We're moving out of this house.

I've seen some BBC documentary the featured some family adopting some kid who ended up just like me, pushing away, hated being given any kind of positiveness . He went to prison and killed himself. I've probably been close to both.

I know im in that destroy mood, but really cant get out unless I destroy something. Recently being my housemates and great friend Harry and my relationship. I pushed a Buddhist minded enough guy to punch doors I was being such a dick. Heavy recreational week. 

I'm hitting 30, and have no idea what to do about this. I've done CBT, paid tons on counselling. I cant keep destroying jobs and relations.

What is this making me do this. What can I do to stop fucking everything up!?!?",26Jul2017,1
59,I feel like each day a tiny piece of me is being lost and my mind is losing grip with reality. I had to go on a walk today to gain control. I'm getting older so maybe that's the issue? Nothing seems worth it anymore. I think about not existing all the time and the idea that I have a minimum 30 years left of this shit. I keep seeing my life as if I'm looking through a TV and what I'm seeing on tv is my life. Anyone out there have anything simliar and want to talk or anyone just want to talk? Doesn't have to be about my health. Anything interesting really. ,26Jul2017,2
61,"My life in Crisis- a total mess

At 18, I can say with confidence my life is a total mess. Why? Because I have pretty much every problem in the world 

Bear with me. This may be long. I have no one else to talk to so even if just one person responds, I'm grateful.

Do you know that feeling where something isn't quite right ? Have you ever had that feeling when things were going well in life but for whatever reason you just feel numb, distant, unhappy, not fully there? Well I have that feeling- but that difference is that is combined with the fact that things ARENT going well in life. 

Category #1: Problems in my Head 

-C-PTSD ( not just one traumatic event, therefore complex PTSD. Childhood emotional abuse and psychological damage. Trauma from peers at school and bullying in the past. Constantly feel on guard, replaying moments of past, embarrassment, anxiety, shame and panic attacks as well, hopelessness, stress)

-Attachment Trauma ( emotionally attached to people from my past who aren't in my life anymore. Even peoples faces who I would just see in the hall at school but never talked to, still cross my mind to this date. Ex lovers, friends, and people, places and things in general. Kind of goes hand in hand with the PTSD thing. Never felt bonded to mom, dad was barely in life do to having bipolar and schizophrenia as well as narcissist mom manipulating the situation and keeping him away from me and my brother, saying he didn't want to see us and it's his loss, despite him actually wanting to see us. Have random fantasies about impressing others or being ""better than them"" or being a model ( that almost DID happen so I guess it's not that delusional but the connotation tied to it is) 

-Codependency ( care more what others think about me (also do to moms brainwashing)  I am an empath so I get over stimulated by others feelings and energy, problems with boundaries, needed guy or male attention to fulfill me for awhile, didn't understand you need to be your full self to attract what you want. Easily affected by my moms mood and always thinking about her feelings and beliefs before mine. My mind and life have mostly revolved around her. I had drinking issues in the past as well. Constantly feel under display, like the world is watching and judging me. Simultaneously seeking the worlds validation, instead of the other way around. Caring more about my moms problems that were usually brought on by herself, ironically) 

-Anxiety and Depression- (over think things, have trouble staying focused and motivated, feel guilty when things are going well, or like it won't last long, unhappy, thought it was just being a teen but I think it runs deeper)

-Disassociation ( hardly ever feel fully present, in the moment. Have trouble feeling feelings whether good or bad. Takes me a few extra seconds to process information than others or gather thoughts or what I want to say. Trouble articulating sometimes. Feel awkward. Constant distant look in my eyes ( others have pointed this out.) Felt like I'm just going through the motions of life, don't feel emotionally like an 18 year old (more like 15) never really felt like I had a childhood or full teen experience, or those milestones and rites of passage if it makes sense. Barely any sense of self or confidence. Trouble with feeling romantic connections, don't feel that ""spark during sex"" could also be because I haven't met the right person 

Category #2: Real life problems 

-My mom ( total narcissist and begins of alcoholism. Found 6 empty wine bottles in a backpack that were hers. Always been her therapist, scapegoat, object to manipulate for her amusement and projections. Had mental breakdown first year at university and she twisted the situation to guilt, manipulate and minimize my feelings that I didn't realize it was a mental breakdown for a few months until after it happened. Mom tries to control and manipulate everything I do and uses me for narcissistic supply, goes through my things and tries to gather intel to use against me to abide to her demands. Freaks out over littlest things like me using things in the kitchen. Triggers PTSD like reactions when she bursts into room to yell and dehumanize me for smallest things. Treats to me and talks to me in a negative, patronizing, or fake nice tone) 

-Debt ( student loans of around 10k. unpaid credit card debt of about 10 months around 2k. Owe mom 6k. Back in with mom because if this) 

-School ( flunked out and got 3 credits this year because my issues got the better of me and I never went to class, wasted all my tuition money because I had a break from reality and melt down, couldn't focus, etc.. on probation but can re apply in a year. I'm about two years behind everyone else and feel awful and guilty about myself)

-Legal. MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE. ( saw a 26 year old man I met on an app at 17 and for some reason thought this was a good idea. He is horribly abusive, manipulative etc.. we had sex. One day posted him on the dirty out of rage detailing all he did to me. Been almost two years and we both have tried and can't get post down. He wants to sue me in court. They send papers to your house, so if does go through with the process my mom would get them first. She has no idea of this and would rage) 

Friends ( have none. Have problems with closeness, feeling relatable to others, overly awkward and self conscious. Can't stay at any friends place if I have 0. Stuck with N mom. Feel like I'm missing out on life)

Dating and romance ( no bfs or current dates. ONLY seem to attract narcissists or creeps. Used to use sex as a way to get guys to like me ""secure them down"" Been told I'm really attractive so this combined with my codependency is a recipe for men to use me)

Career ( not sure what I want to do in life. Plan to go to university in Paris in a year or so after I sort my issues just for a fresh start. Mom manipulated me into believing I was bad at math so I never pursued anything in math or business and did poli science first year as my mom convinced me, she did it also. Got good grades in it until I stopped going to school. Not sure if I want to continue it) 

Overall, I feel like I've missed out on most of what my life could have been. I've never had a bf, just men who have used me. Was never popular and never really had friends, went to prom alone, never got asked to dances by guys despite being attractive I guess they sense my issues etc etc.. )

I just feel worn out at 18. Been feeling this way since about 15.",26Jul2017,3
62,"Hey, I'm doing great today.  But I just want to reach out to people who are feeling bummed or depressed.  I hope you are doing fine but if you are not let's all just bond and talk about mental health.

I hope the moderators allow this thread people really do need a safe space to discuss how they are feeling. ",26Jul2017,11
63,"Hi, long story short I have been creating one line drawings as a little side hobby. Not only does it help me drown out the struggles of my current 5 year battle of anorexia but I absolutely love it, and have decided to take on a bit of a project, but I need some help!

I want to create an art piece based on other people's view of mental illness. It can be to do with anything surrounding mental illness such as your own experience, having to watch others go through it, how it feels like to loose someone from a mental illness etc. It only needs to be a sentence or two, of even just an image or an object.

I've opened it up on other social media in which friends and acquaintances can see, but I want input from anyone and everyone as without submissions from others, it won't work!

Thank you! :-)",26Jul2017,6

I feel conflicted

First want to just say: I'm not completely ignorant, I used to have depression and anxiety for years but for unknown reasons this resolved about 5 years ago.

Story 1 : I have a friend lets call him ""Cameron"", my friend Cameron has had an interest in a girl, she's become a good friend to him and they've also been casually sleeping together for a few months every now and then. She has anxiety. Quite frequently they make plans together - to meet a certain day to do certain plans, and she just doesn't show up, she doesn't let him know she isn't going to show up, she doesn't say anything, even for days after she stands him up she doesn't reply to his messages, he actually suffers depression himself and when she does this it totally bums him out and he gets into a bad place, she also doesn't speak to him randomly for days. When he told me she was doing this I was like ""dude wtf, thats so inconsiderate, if someone can no longer meet for plans for any reason they should at least let you know so you can make other plans and not be expecting them, thats just rude"", and he's then explained to me that she does really care about him she just gets anxious and doesn't want to talk to anyone for days. So I feel conflicted because instinctively I'm thinking that he deserves to be treated better than that, but I'm also like, is it acceptable because she's anxious? He seems to think so but I also see him really upset. He's also told me at times she's posting pics of her on social media, out and about, meanwhile ignoring him for days because she's too anxious to chat.

Story 2 : I recently started talking to a girl on a dating app, (yes I'm also a girl), she was refreshingly confident and chatty, sent me lots of snap chat videos, was talking to me a lot, was forward and interested, we planned to go on a date and she said she was broke so I just said it's fine I'll pay, and she said she'd pay for the next date, she's planning a second date before the first. We met and it went well, went on a walk, we chatted for ages, she confided in me things that I would be hesitant to even tell my closest friends about myself if those things were about me, and I didn't ask. She genuinely seems sweet and considerate. She messaged me after saying sweet things about me and asking about a second date, she mentioned that she ""loves honesty"". Over the next week she's not so chatty but I know she's back to work, and she says she's working so isn't on her phone, a few days later when I'm asking about meeting again she just stops talking to me. So I messaged since saying ""you said you love honesty so whats changed? Be honest with me"" **ignored** So yesterday I just messaged her saying I didn't think she'd ghost me and I am a human being and I do have feelings, and that if someone isn't interested, thats absolutely fine, you can change your mind, but to just completely ignore someone without any explanation after showing an interest?? She replied finally she said she got scared of getting close to someone, and that she's unwell at the moment and had a panic attack that morning (unrelated I think). So on the one hand I wanna be the person who's like ""don't do this to people because it's hurtful"" but on the other hand, she anxious? like does that make it ok?? Thing is I don't get involved so easily, and I waited but she just plain ignored me so I'm dating someone else, I'm not totally butt hurt over her not being interested, I do think it's wrong to ghost someone though and I do think had I been someone who was easily emotionally involved that could be quite harmful.

I've been anxious, I used to have constant panic attacks, and I was probably inconsiderate too sometimes, but I can't imagine I'd ever not message someone a line to let them know I'm gonna cancel or that I'm not able to talk right now.

Morally, should one make exceptions to rudeness / inconsideration because of anxiety?

------------

OK Story 3 if you can be bothered : Same friend Cameron used to have a (different) girlfriend, she was extremely jealous, she knew I was his best friend but occasionally would throw jealous remarks at him about me despite having met me many times and been v friendly with me, the worst of it was she would be physically abusive towards him (or like, try to be, have the intent to be, is the point), she was v controlling about who he spoke to and didn't like him on his phone or his computer. Because of her abusive behaviour eventually he refused to go out drinking with her because she got them kicked out of several of his favourite clubs over random jealousy, aggression and drama. All of the above was always excused because she has anxiety. I tried helping her a few times but she really didn't want to help herself other than smoking weed(?).

I'm not trying to attack anxiety, I've had it, I get it, I prob put one of my ex boyfriends through absolute hell myself, I'm sure (like ..not abuse/jealousy though). I'm trying to educate myself how much trauma is acceptable, when do you hold someone accountable for their actions. ",26Jul2017,1
70,"I am 31 years old and  I've been a lurker/internet junkie my whole life.  I believe this is my first created thread though.  I am a married father of 4 (1 step daughter, 1 adopted son of my wife's, 2 in vitro babies) and I feel like I'm at the end.  I've had severe mental illness (anxiety, depression, ADD, schizoid personality disorder, agoraphobia...all diagnosed by Indianapolis psychiatrists) since I was 17.  I feel like this is the end for me.  Anyone diagnosed with S.P.D. or anyone in general really able to shine some light somewhere in this? I'm just scared. 

I am also an alcoholic which is how I've dealt the last 10 or so years.  Though I'm relatively sober due to antabuse the last 9 months.

Sorry, I keep editing this.  I feel like I have no hope left. I am an accountant with a typical accounting job and I just have lost (or maybe have never had) any hope.",26Jul2017,1
71,"Hi all, been living with what I think is a mental illness now for a few years. I feel like I panic over very stupid things as I could be laid in bed panicking I'm going to have a heart attack. Very silly I know.

I'm 23 years old and getting rather sick of living this way. Most of it can be work related panic, for example wondering if I have done enough during my shift or whatever. Sometimes I can worry about this and feel my chest tightening and then within 10 mins laugh about it. Very strange behaviour.

What could be happening too me?",26Jul2017,1
