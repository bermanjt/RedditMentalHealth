0," I'm in a 4 person family, and my sister is the oldest. She's 20,  has Aspbergers, and acts like a child sometimes. She always finds a way to argue with my family, or interrupt someone when speaking. She makes random loud noises, like if we go over a speedbump, or if she gets bumped by a person. She always chews with her mouth open,  and tries to push people into doing something she wants. She recently started loving homestuck, and goes on and on about it, and my parents fake interest in it. Within the past 6 months, everything she does makes me irritated. Every time she mentions homestuck, every time she makes a loud noise,  every time she chews with her mouth open. I know she can't help it, and I used to always tolerate everything she does,  but whenever my family and I go out,  I'm always trying to ignore her. Everything she does makes me angry.  I hate it,  I feel like I hate her,  and I just can't stand seeing what stupid shit she does next. I feel terrible ranting about her, but I needed to talk about it. Should I get a therapist to talk to about this?  Is there something I can do to make her behaviors more bearable?  Thanks. 
tldr: Older sister has autistic behaviors that drive me insane.  I think I need a therapist to talk to about this. 
EDIT: thanks for the advice.  I spent tonight trying to realize I was overreacting, and that she isn't trying to annoy me. It was a lot nicer, and we had fun talking about super smash bros.  Planning on playing together soon! ",23Dec2017,2
2,There is a fascist element among the members who believe that no views but prolife views should be posted.  The  members will bully you and lie to management until you are suspended!   Management will send you a suspended notice without a single syllable of information about what you said that got you suspended.  The management won't even ask to hear how you respond to the unknown accusations before suspending you.  This is hypocracy and bullying at its worst.  We all have heard this happens in chat rooms.  I'm just telling you one of the places it happens.  I was made considerably more ill by the bullying and the subsequent aggrivation.  ,23Dec2017,16
3,"Yeah, probably.  My brother in law and sister came home.  I got a ride with them both from the airport, it was just me and them in one of the cars.  My sister kept saying the job I left was a ""dumb job"". She worked this into the conversation a few times.  For some reason I felt bad, even though it wasn't a great job. It had it's upside, but I didn't feel comfortable with the 2 year contract.  I'm being oversensitive aren't I? I mean, why do I care? I left that job.  Either way, I still found myself trying to defend it.",23Dec2017,3
6,"TW: self harm, disordered eating, suicidal thoughts

I am a 26 year old female from the united states.  Recently, I began working as a temp for a very well respected hospital in a neighboring city.  This temp job comes with the possibility of gaining full time employment with one of the best universities in the country, which provides amazing benefits, and would essentially guarantee me full time work until retirement if I get hired.  I got this job after 9 months of unemployment, during which time I lost my insurance, was forced to go off my meds cold turkey, and experienced my first inpatient psychiatric stay.  

When I got my job i was thrilled, it seemed like many of my problems would be solved. I would no longer isolate myself, I would have income to feed myself, and the possibility of gaining full time work with benifits seemed within reach.  After about 3 months in my department I have realized I was very wrong about all of this. 

My job requires me to deliver medicare forms to people at the hospital.  Every day I have to tell sick people and their families that their medical stays will not be covered by medicare.  When I am not delivering bad news, I am delivering the same redundent speech about medicare upwards of 60 times a day to people who don't care.  Patients, nurses, and doctors make it known that they cannot stand when myself or a member of my team comes to visit.  I dislike my coworkers, and there is little to no room for growth within my department.  I am, of course, forced to smile through all of this and act like I enjoy my job.  After work I am so mentally exhausted that I just lay on the couch and watch tv, or get drunk (I can't smoke weed anymore because I am looking for other work).  Rarely do I find the energy to see my friends.

I have begun crying in the bathrooms at work when I get the chance to slip away for a moment.  Recently, the stress from delivering uncomfortable news to people all day has lead me to begin self harming again.  I have also begun to restrict my food intake and purge after eating, something I havent done in almost 6 years.  I strongly suspect all of these behaviors are cropping up again because I feel so powerless, stuck in this job that I hate, with little opportunity for work elsewhere, or return back to school.  Leaving work does not feel like an option, and I am on Medicaid right now, so I don't have much faith that I could find good mental health care that accepts my insurance. 

I went to university with the intention of doing some kind of social justice work when I left.  For over 2 years i have been looking for work in the nonprofit sector, in fields where I would have the ability to really make a difference in the lives of others.  Never did I imagine I would be stuck working with a team of narow minded people, who love nothing more than to make fun of others for being transgender, gay, fat, or ""crazy"".  The other day they were even all talking about how it's your own fault if you get sexually assaulted and don't report the crime, and that it's okay for old men to ""cop a feel"" simply because they are older.  This, coming from people in one of the most ""liberal"", well educated cities in the country *eye roll*. 

In the past, I have been on mood stabilizers, antidepressents, and antianxiety meds.  I have tried DBT, and 1 on 1 therapy with about 6-7 different providers, and nothing much has helped.  I am currently diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and BPD, have experience psychosis, and have had trouble with substance abuse, self harm, binging, purging, restricting food intake, and suicidal thoughts.  

No one knows that I have been resorting to destructive coping mechanisms to get through the day.  I don't know what to do for myself.  I am scared to tell anyone what is going on with me mentally because I feel like there is very little that can be done, and I dont want to scare anyone.  I feel like I am such a burden on the people around me already, because I have so many issues I am always trying to keep at bay.  I just need some advice on how I can get through this, I feel like my life is just one rough patch after another and I really dont know what to do anymore.  Any advice is welcome.  Thank you for taking the time to read my story. ",23Dec2017,2
7,"I see animals and people as just interactive toys. There's no evidence they feel pain or are even alive. There's evidence that other people are just video game/virtual reality characters who seem real but aren't, and there's no evidence of the reverse...

Characters in video games for example, some are programmed better than others so it can be interesting to see how they're built and how they react to different things. I'm not deceived easily. Video game characters can convince you of a lot of things; that they can feel sad, feel happy, are alive, but they aren't.

When I was younger I always cried at movies because my empathy was really high and I hadn't come across the evidence just yet. As I've grown up I've became more aware of the true nature of the world I live in and I can now shut my empathy off since why should I waste my emotional time on something that there is no evidence is even real or alive? For all I know when I look away from friends or family they just cease to exist since that's how video games are coded. My friends and family are just a bunch of lines of coding. They're there, but at the same time they aren't and I'm alone. I code from time to time so I know the bits and bobs of programming and how video games function and are made to deceive.

It may sound fucked up but from all the evidence I have gathered over years, I'm concluding it as the truth. Truth sad as it may be, is still truth.

You can probably try to *imagine* (if your programming/coding is capable of it, which I'm sure it is) how lonely I feel despite having quite a few close friends. I'm the only real person here (my mind/conscious is real/I am conscious, but my real-world body may look completely different from the 'avatar' body I have here). Everyone else is just a video game character programmed to deceive me into thinking they're real but as I've collected a lot of evidence over the past decade to prove otherwise, but not the reverse.

I have a theory that I actually died at some point, in a real world, perhaps in a kind of horrific accident. I was hooked up to some kind of Virtual Reality program so I can live a life while I am in an incurable coma. Even though my body looking in a mirror is in their mid twenties, I could be fourty, fifty or maybe sixty years old, but I have no memory of my previous life living in the real world, either due to my memory being wiped or because of the accident.

**Here's just some examples of the evidence;**

1. The fact there’s no evidence to prove that other people are alive.

9,"I've always been realisitc with myself because lying to yourself is only detrimental. I have a small penis, baby face, and women all see me as a kid. I am a virgin, and have no experience whatsoever with females. I avoid eye contact with attractive females, and display beta male behavior such as because I was raised as an only child with a feminist single mother who instilled her feminism into me, thus turning me into a beta male pussy. Accepting it will never be easy, and makes me so fucking depressed knowing that in today's society I will never be able to change this. People give you the generic ""size doesnt matter"" bullshit, but in the end, my 5 inch erect, no girth, child-like looking dick is a constant reminder to me, that even if I somehow manage to lose my virginity, and have sex, and find a girlfriend, maybe even a wife, her sex life will be handicapped. She will forever have to stay loyal to me and my 5 inch dick that is inferior to the other dicks she's had in past. She will know that my dick is small, factually. And I will know it. We'll know that we both know it too, because she'll try and come up with ways to make me feel better, and lie to herself and try to come up with some proactive reasons, etc. so I don't feel emasculated. I could have all the money in the world to compensate for the pathetic bullshit I have for a dick, I could be a multi millionaire, and have materialistic bullshit and nice cars, etc. But even then, chances are that even if I manage to find a woman, she'll likely end up cheating on me with someone who can actually satisfy her sexual needs as a woman, that I will never really be able to fulfill. 

3 days ago I met this girl, and we clicked instantly. She was perfect, fine as hell, literally my type, and to me perfect. We had so much in common, she was receptive to me, and she was talking to me about so much stuff we had in common and I really fucking liked this girl, she's 20, i'm 18 as of 5 days ago. I couldnt stop thinking about her, and I have tried too hard to lie to myself all these years because I had put up these thick emotional walls to hide behind. Well, I'm broken. I spent today with her and our mutual friend, today and we where alone for a long time after texting a whole day prior back and forth, I asked her to tell me honestly if she was attracted to me so I wouldnt emotionally invest more and get rejected when the bond has been fortified because there was sexual tension, and we both felt it, and I didnt want to let myself get attached so I asked her to tell me honestly. She said she sees me as a kid, that she wasnt going to lie, but im mature, sweet, really nice, etc, but she isnt attracted to me but that she loves my personality and all this repetitive shit i've heard a million times before, and I told her I was done with any and all attempts of trying to become intimate where no longer going to happen and that I was absolutely fine and she was trying to make me feel better afterwards saying that she's toxic, and that im all innocent and pure and that she would only corrupt me etc because shes got a bunch of issues, and would turn my world upside down, and only be detrimental to me, etc. But the worst part is that I'm so desperate for a connection that I already knew all this since the beginning and had already accepted her and her issues because I had this intense attraction for her. Saddest part is that she's thick as hell and has a hell of a body. So If i ever tried to have sex, my dick probably wouldnt make it past her cheeks, inside. It's cruel how life fucked me genetically, and that our society is the way it is. And the truth is so damn hurtful to me psychologically, that the only way to cope is to put of walls and walls and walls and not letting yourself become vulnerable again. But I'm simply going to accept these facts, and simply acknowledge the existence of the validity behind them. I dont think I could trust anyone enough to marry them, have kids, and then find out my wife has been cheating on me all this time and reaping the benefits I offer. I think I would legitimately snap and become cold hearted for life.

Fuck my life

14,"I have always been independent because my mother neglected me, but I went to therapy for a year when I went NC. I went through the stages of grief and was very vocal and close to my dad regarding my emotions. That was my senior year of high school and I am now a college sophomore going into my second 

 I have always been able to be by myself through my life and be fine, but lately I've noticed at my school (I live in an apartment) and when I came home all I wanted to do is lay all day on my phone. For the past few weeks if I didn't have work or class I was laying around talking to no one from when I wake til bed. I won't talk to people for days on end, not even family that I am close to. I used to not have very many friends to hang out with, but I always had my dad to watch tv with.

 I haven't talked to my home friends in months because they haven't texted me, and I don't hang out with college peers because I am at an art school which my homework is studio work, which requires me to actually go there and be around peers as I work. Even if I didn't have that there's no one to hang out with. It's tiring and it's hard to ask around. Idk what to even do. It's uncomfortable when someone comes over. I didn't get to have kids come over wen I was young, it feels too abnormal. 

I didn't work for a good week this Christmas break and I laid in bed the whole time, exhausted. This semester was horribly stressful for me, but I am switching majors so I thought I'd be fine. I am not able to remember the last time I talked to a friend like normal. No one even tries to see how my life is going. That's okay though.

18,"Hey guys, 
So I'll cut right to the chase. I've been experiencing auditory hallucinations. Just how I woke up because I thought I heard a baby crying. I even turned off my heat and still heard it. I know there's no baby crying, my baby brother is fast asleep and there aren't any cars on the road, nor any neighbours close enough for me to hear that from their houses. It sounded like it was right behind my door. I had a small panic attack but reasoned myself out of it, for the time being. 
I've also been experiencing this feeling of a man screaming in my head. It's random, I can't place a trigger or anything like that. Whether I'm alone or with people, it happens. It causes severe anxiety and I have to stop whatever I'm doing and devote my full attention to getting the feeling out. It's like it's right at the core of my brain, taking over all my processes. Sometimes I find myself to have stopped breathing because I'm so focused on getting rid of it.

My entire demeanor changes, I’ll start silently speaking when I talk with them in my head, I’ll smile, laugh, sometimes cry. But I’ve never thought much of it because I was a pretty lonely child growing up, I didn’t have much friends and I was mostly by myself. So I made up conversations and places and scenarios to keep me from feeling that lonely. It’s gotten bad recently to the point where I’m doing it involuntarily. It’s so hard for me to explain, but I basically will run a scenario in my head, talk and cry or rant, acknowledge that it’s not real but I can’t stop talking to myself no matter what. I have such a hard time living in the moment, even for the smallest of things. Like having lunch, or seeing a cool post and talking about it, or talking with a therapist, it’s all in my head.

I recently found out from a friend that his drug use has become worse than usual and he has got a girlfriend 6 years younger than him. I was pretty much abused by older men when I was younger which has made him always extremely funny about friends/girlfriends with bigger age gaps. The breakup has been extremely hard for me due to the fact I have severe mental health problems and at times he was basically my carer. 

I also tried to get over the fact by meeting someone on tinder, he seemed overly interested in me, probably preyed on the fact I was vulnerable, used me for sex then barely spoke to me again. I blocked his details as well. 

This made me relapse from a 35 day clean streak without alcohol and I've there for been drunk for the good part of 4 days.

24,"I guess I should describe myself first? I have been struggling with mental illness since I was like 13/14 years old. It started with my body image. I absolutely hated my nose, thought I look like a mean retard on pictures and just looked too big. Due to that I had huge problems with eating and started to count how many days i could go without eating or only ate the glucose drops for a period of time.

Thinking about it, I guess I was never normal. Even when I was very young I had fantasies of people serving me and me being on top of the world (I won't go into detail).

In high school I was always very ambitious and studying was basically my whole life. When I first started high school, I did have a few friends, however, the amount of friends that I had gradually decreased with time until I only had a few acquaintances in my last years of school. I'd talk to about 3 people in school, but never met them after school or hung out with anyone else. All that time was dedicated to studying. Also, when I say that I'd talk to 3 people, I mean 3 people exclusively. I only spoke to others when it was really necessary.

Surprisingly, I met my boyfriend during this time. I guess the reason why it worked out was because we met online and I could warm up to him ""from a distance"".

I'm 19 years old now and graduated from high school in a European country with the best score possible. I'm now taking off a gap year which I wanted to use to get my mental health back on track (to no avail as it seems right now) and to earn money. I'm currently interning at a software company (it's a longer internship) and also going to therapy, but I feel like therapy doesn't do much.

Anyway, that's my ""story"", if that's what you want to call it, onto my current situation. I have been a wreck since graduating. People keep telling me that I'm special and smart but I don't feel the same way and feel that people don't understand that for high school, you don't need to be intelligent. Even for maths all you need to learn are the different patterns and then just use them on the different questions. It's just a matter of how much effort you are willing to put into it. I applied for different universities in the UK to study computer science. I like what I do at my internship right now (I basically have my own project that I get to develop and that they actually want to implement into their own software (yes I know I'm getting exploited, I earn basically nothing)), but I'm so afraid I will fail the course, especially the maths part. I'm already 19, 20 once I start university. If I fail the first year I will be 22 by the time I could start any other course. No university will take me after spending a gap year working at a software company and other places after this internship, then doing a year of computer science and suddenly quitting. Of course they will know I quit because I was too stupid.

University is different than high school, in mathematical departments at least, you actually have to be smart.

In addition to that, I'm very anxious about a lot of things, like when I pull out of a parking spot I'm paranoid about having hit a car or I'm afraid of getting a speeding ticket all the time. When I leave work, I have to check my computer like 10 times to make sure it's turned off and even though I do not have access to anything like that, I'm always afraid I'd leak some private company information nobody is supposed to know. Or when I resell my old clothing online I have to check the addresses a million times and even after that I'm afraid I sent it to the wrong address. It was really bad during my finals in high school. After my math exam, I couldn't eat for days and during the exam I actually tried to memorize the question so I could check them at home.

My looks aren't as much of a problem now, even though I still hate them but I just do not have the strength to deal with that now.

I'm so afraid of ending up poor. I already save up all of the money I have but I just don't know where my life is supposed to go because I can not live like this. I cry on a daily basis and I feel like a burden to my boyfriend.",23Dec2017,0
25,"This post has its basis in 'childhood stuff' so just a heads up.

Tonight I was going for a walk and I witnessed a car crash and, for whatever reason, it has absolutely thrown me. I have been in therapy since last year dealing with childhood trauma and, since then/disclosing the abuse, have experienced brain fod and dissociation like I can never recall experiencing before.

I don't fully understand as to why after disclosing the abuse this has started but I 'get it' a little bit. What I don't get is why the car crash has made me feel so sick. I used to do volunter work for a first aid group I belonged to. I have literally trained to deal with this stuff (and did so when little). It was after I heard the bang that I dissociated (just felt 'dizzy' remembering it then too) and I cannot recall whether I actually saw the crash or just heard the noise. I have a vague memory of seeing it but I'm not sure (which ties in with a lot of the issues I have surrouding do I actually remember abuse or not (and I just went 'dizzy' then too)).

Walking home I was just out of it, get inside and my mum asks ""Why are your eyes rolling back in your head?"". It has been hours since (and I've lost all of those hours, I've been in a daze, just out of it) and the massive headache which started afterwards is still there. I wasn't in any danger, haven't been in or near a car crash myself but it has triggered something and I honestly don't understand what.

I used to think that, because of always being hyper vigilante, that I would 'come alive' during an emergency but the opposite happened here. Maybe I fooled myself previously and this is actually how I'd react but I saw another car crash, in the same place, a few weeks back and was fine. Actually did want to rush in and help.

This time I went to black out. Anyone have any idea why? As I wrote this I've zoned out a number of times. I don't get it.",23Dec2017,3
26,"Every single time I try and talk about my feelings and whats going on inside my head, even if I just think about it or type it out, I become so so tense and stressed out that I shut down and I hate it. I'm scared that once I start therapy sometime in the future there will be no progress whatsoever because my brain forces itself to go quiet. So when I do, I have to be vague about it or keep it short and sweet so I don't shut down. Sometimes it gets so bad that it even makes so I don't even talk at all. I've tried fixing it myself, like... Taking it slow, not delving directly into the tough stuff immediately or to anything that really makes me feel like shit, but it doesn't matter. I wish I knew why I was like this. ",23Dec2017,37
29,"I get so, so, SO unbelievably lost in my thoughts and feelings. 

I get triggered in to so much anger and fucked up hopeless stuff and don't know how to express it, and can't stand the things people say to me about ""it"" because I've been attacking ""it"", or rather ""them"" for so long and have tried, or been doing, everything a person could suggest for so long, but to no avail.

The one thing that is kinda helping is 12 step work. The people I know through that program offer me some of the best examples of how it's possible to go from a broken person who wants to die, to a person who has learned to thrive in spite of their brokenness.

Just lost the desire to post....thinking ahead to how embarrassed I will be to read any responses.

Spent the last couple days obsessing about a particular coworker who likes to belittle me in small ways, who's ham fisted ""jokes"" and general narrow minded view of the world tends to cast me in a negative light, and who seems to think they are ""better"" than I am. This person is actually a good person overall, and definitely not ""the worst"" when it comes to bullying, but they've triggered ""my crap"", which isn't hard to do, and so now they are taking their turn on the obsessive merry go round in my mind.

It's so annoying how my mind works. It just laser focuses in on person, or fact of life, or something that hurts no matter what it is, and just repeats it ad nauseum for days and days, and guts me, doesn't let me go, no matter what I share, or type, or do (CBT, DBT, PRAYER). It then intersperses nearly every gap in thought with obsessions over other regrets, other pain.

I'm so unbelievably angry, fed up, ready to just flip the fuck out and disappear in to a void. But I can't, because I'm trying to get somewhere, so I have to put up with the indignities, and blah blah blah soldier on, inspiring bullshit, blah blah blah, everything is so annoying, jsut barely hanging on, fuck this world, poor me.",23Dec2017,1
31,"Throw away account. 
My husband tells me often that living is miserable and that the only reason he hasn't killed himself os because he doesn't want to leave me all alone. 
I've tried to get him help, but he doesn't trust doctors and doesn't seem able/willing(?) To try to make changes to improve his mental health and seems resigned to just ""being this way"" or blames external circumstances for his pain. 
I love him very much, he is my best friend and this is so painful to watch. I feel so helpless and it wears on me and I find myself feeling depressed on days when he confides in me. 

Has anyone been through a situation like this? Is there any light at the end of the tunnel? What can I do to support my husband? ",23Dec2017,3

33,"Nothing seems pleasurable anymore. The dopamine rush I would get from studying no longer exists and I have zero motivation to do anything. I can't get to sleep till 6am and wake up in the afternoon. I can't relate to the motivated and confident person I was before. 

I had an adverse drug experience just over a month ago and I believe it is possible that I am still recovering. My whole life I considered myself to be unattractive and had low self-esteem regarding this aspect of life , however I became a strong and confident individual and did well in studies. Recently I have had a lot of attention from women , and have had lots of opportunities to sleep with them. As soon as this attention started I have been suffering from erectile dysfunction , even when I wake up in the morning and this has led to me losing confidence and trying to avoid sexual encounters . I feel like I've been kicked in the teeth, and robbed of my masculinity and opportunity to come to terms with my biggest insecurity.

I feel like running away to another country. I've completely lost motivation in college and rarely attend. I want to go back to who I used to be but don't know how.

36,"I feel like I cannot focus when I am trying to concentrate on something. When Im watching a YouTube video or something like that, my mind always drifts off and I am always thinking about what's going on in my life, sometimes it's about all of the bad things that's going on in my life. I feel like I can't focus and when I drift off I catch myself after a bit and then the cycle kind of repeats itself. I don't know if it's anxiety or what but I just feel like my brain isn't able to rest and that it's not really breathing kind of, if that makes sense. I thought about meditating, which I haven't done yet, but I have tried and even then I have troubles focusing on my breathing. Maybe I just need to meditate more, I don't know.

Is there any reason why my focus is this bad now? I've been exercising recently and eating healthy for the most part but my focus seems like it has gotten worse. Any help at all would be greatly appreciated ",23Dec2017,2
38,"I’m back to the point where I’m overly fixated on my teeth (which, for the record, I always am). My guess is that I now spend at least 15-20 minutes on brushing my teeth after every meal (which is about once per day - and a small one). I brush the same teeth over and over again numerous times because I’m afraid I might have missed a spot and, as a result, will get cavities. Which, again, will result in discolored teeth. I stopped eating and drinking anything that’s bad for my teeth in 2016. Even then, I barely ate and/or drank anything that could damage my teeth. 
I stopped that year because I felt terrible each and every time I consumed anything that could damage my teeth. For example, I could get pictures of my teeth rotting while attempting to eat a chocolate, or constantly thinking about future cavities and fillings while attempting to drink an energy drink through a straw (to avoid getting anything on my teeth). 

I haven’t tried eating or drinking anything like that since, so I don’t know how I’d feel now. If how I feel now is any indication, I’d still feel pretty terrible to this day. It’s tiresome... I do enjoy food, but the whole regiment I have to go through afterwards just isn’t worth it. It’s not uncommon that I only eat about four sandwiches per day. Basically, I usually eat breakfast, and nothing else. I do sometimes wait until later on during the day so I won’t have to walk around feeling too hungry for too long. ",23Dec2017,1
39,"A neo nice guy who screens people for that ultimate goal of marriage.  I'm not going to get into the details of this, but I was really hoping ""they"" were at least feminist psychologists.  I want to have honest relationships with women, without the burden of thinking of marriage or if they're fit for dating, whatever that is. I don't think that's possible now, because in the back of my mind I'm always calculating for a ridiculous end and for ridiculous reasons.

It would've been nice, if I could've just been a little less sensitive to rejection (hard time with that in the past). That I could've just been a little bit more free to feel the pain and move on, but now I don't know who I am.",23Dec2017,2
40,I'm a college student from the U.S. and am looking to start seeing a therapist or clinical psychologist next semester. I have one of those Aetna student health plans that some universities provide.

41,"not sure if this is the right place.

I'm young, almost 16, male. And I've been having very specific thoughts of killing random people or even people I love. Its not even a thought of hate or passion so to say, but just to *apologies for the morbidity* stab someone repeatedly, for no reason. I'm not a stressed or depressed person, I'm a pretty happy and well for the most part emotionally stable person (ironic). 

I really really hate to say stuff like this, but just the thought of stabbing someone repeatedly with blood splattering everywhere is something that almost pleasures me (not sexually). sometimes when no ones home I'll fill water bottles with red paint entirely and grab a kitchen knife and just start stabbing them. (god this is cringey)

Obviously I should be worried, right? I've heard stories of stuff like this blowing up into much more

I would never want to hurt someone.

Please help, I have a long term girlfriend. a family who loves me, but is even sometimes scared of me. I've never ever hurt anyone in my family, I've never laid a finger on them. But I dont want anything bad to happen.

Sorry for this mess of a post.

44,"So I'm 99% sure my older sister has NPD.. and a very agressive form of it,throughout my life it has really damaged me but I don't think I will ever get closure for that anyway my question is about pathological liars..

As an example she will literally come out with the most crazy lies..every single topic that comes up she will have a friend &amp; a bazar story for the topic. She will make up conversations she's had with people I no this because I've over heard her telling people something she talked about with me and it never happened at all.

I could go into more detailed lies if nessary  but my question is how to deal with this.. all my life I've bowed down to her and she plays off it and to be quiet honest I don't even have the energy to confront her because there really is no point 

She's spread lies about me too which really hurts and I don't no how to deal with it because I just pretend I'm quiet and that we get on and I don't no all these things about her..it's a really frustrating situation 

Also It would  be very interested to no DOES SHE KNOW SHES LYING! Does she believe that the things she says really happened does she have a warped since of reality and actually think it's all true! 

For example a friend of hers told me that my sister told her she was raped (my sister has never told me that herself) but her opinion on rape is that it's a girls fault for being drunk etc just victim blaming in general.. is that a coping mechanism for her or did she lie about that too!! It really is such a frustrating and toxic situation ",23Dec2017,2
