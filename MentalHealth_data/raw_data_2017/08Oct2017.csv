0,"I am 16 years old and I have been diagnosed with depression and OPD with OCD on the table. I am on 10 mg. prozac and 300 mg. Wellbutrin. Last week, I didn’t take my meds for five days. Today, my dad and sister went out for a walk and didn’t come back for an hour. I got worried and called 7 Times and each time I got sent to voicemail and each time the voicemail sounded completely different. When they came back, everything felt different like I was dreaming. About half an hour later I went outside to put the recycling out and I heard a female voice say “Hello” but staticky and muffled. Could this be because of the meds? What’s going on?",08Oct2017,2,

However, when I go to my therapist and he asks how I've been, I can't tell him all the bad things I'd thought over saying and wind up just bringing up smaller problems. Maybe I do it so that it seems like I'm handling things well, but it sure as hell doesn't feel like it. How do I get myself to open up in order to get the help I need??",08Oct2017,1,

4,"I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder for almost 3 years now and I am now doubting the diagnosis. While I do meet a lot of the criteria (dissociation, multiple suicide attempts, reckless impulsiveness, self harm, unstable relationships as well as an unstable sense of self), I do not seem to meet the quick rapid mood swings. Instead, I feel I meet more of the criteria for bipolar when it comes to my mood. My deep depression lasts months and when I am feeling extremely elated and engage in risky behaviour, due to feeling so high, it lasts about 2-4 weeks. I have been reading that such mood changes more meet the diagnosis of a mood disorder as bpd moods are so quick to change and never last as long. My psychiatrist has mentioned previously the possibility of a mood disorder but I don't know whether to bring it up  again when I have my next appointment later on this month. Perhaps I meet a diagnosis of both disorders?",08Oct2017,1,
5,"Take a look at this: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960076017301024

Essentially that medication finasteride depletes a TON of neurosteroids causing major depressive symptoms and sexual symptoms also due to pudendal neuropathy. 

Obviously, those symptoms are not coming from 'thoughts' causing 'feelings' and are coming from neurosteroids causing hell symptoms causing negative mood causing negative thoughts. 

Is therapy still effective there when studies are showing that the problem is almost entirely physiological but complex? ",08Oct2017,3,
6," i don't feel mentally free i have these thoughts and ideas that i could be a character from tv shows and movies as if my life would be just like the characters but in reality i know somewhere deep down i won't be going anywhere in life with this mental disorder. I need to be guided to do anything in my life i can never do something alone. I feel confused and lost as if i have no drive to do anything like join the military or even learn and advance. I plan on starting to work out but i'm not sure how long that will hold up. I'm not sure if i have ASPD or another disorder it's really confusing. I can't connect with people naturally like other humans even my family. I seem to come off as  attractive and 
 have mentally noted that women take notice of me, Sit next to me on the bus, But i feel as if i attempted to connect with them it would just end up as me coming across as weird or not alpha enough. I feel suicide would be the best option for me but i don't have the balls to do it. So i guess i am stuck on this tragic earth. Everday i feel as my parents and everyone else can already tell i am failure and a loser that isn't gonna do anything with my life. I really don't know what to do anymore i'm trapped in a place that i can't get out of. I feel the first step is to work out and read books anything for general knowledge. After plan for something in my life to do. I thought of living carefree like tyler Durden but how with no money no i would play the lottery in hopes that i could really win but the chances are very very slim.  Then what live care free with no job and little to none knowledge. I'm basically screwed at this point. Maybe i could be like Neal Caffrey and read a lot of books and become a Social Engineer No i can't do that because first off my anxiety and doubts would prevent me of committing this illegal acts that would make me money Also i'm not sure if have the guts of a sociopath to commit these acts like Neal Caffrey.

7,"This week my new therapist (saw her three times) fired me in a ""my way or the highway"" fashion after she reneged on her proposed treatment plan and insisted that I consent to taking medication that hadn't worked previously. I think she has some narcissistic traits, like a gigantic ego and refusal to admit fault, but she's also pretty young for a MD so inexperience was probably also at play. I would think this kind of scenario would have been addressed in med school, though.

I really need to screen better in future initial interviews but I'm not sure what questions to ask. I don't want to come off as paranoid or jaded. I'm not anti-psychiatry/anti-medication at all, I just have had multiple bad experiences and I've been on every med in the book to no/worse effect. I'm going ahead with her previous treatment plan on my own but I'd really like to find a psychiatrist ASAP who is A) comfortable treating officially medication-resistant patients like myself B) has experience with autism C) has experience dealing with trauma victims (I was abused as a child/teen/young adult and still live with my abusers for financial reasons and until very recently, physical health reasons) and D) has a strong moral compass. 

What kind of questions should I ask?",08Oct2017,1,
8,"I was (forcibly) taking Abilify injections for a few months and really hated it. The whole experience was really triggering and I felt extremely uncomfortable with all of it, especially considering the psychiatrist refused to speak to me about anything without my mother present (this was just over a year ago.... I'm 25), I have been taken advantage of bodily by creepy men before, and there was virtually no therapy involved. He did not personally give me the injections (400mg monthly... I weighed about 112lbs), however, he directly told me that I didn't have a choice. The Abilify itself was debilitating and I felt like a dead person walking.... and I still feel fucked up after a few months of not taking it. Does anyone have any suggestions, or know anything about this drug, or have any experiences with it, or similar experiences? I just really feel like talking about this is crucial and everyone else I've spoken with about t doesn't really seem to take it seriously.... but I feel like he was attempting to rob me of my bodily autonomy. He was rude and loud and when I faked feeling ok just to get away from him, he said that I was like a ""normal person now,"" and when I told someone about this, they just said ""well, doctors have horrible bedside manners...."" and they had never met the person. I feel like this is a serious issue and I've been trying to rationalize it since but I can't see a reason as to why anyone felt force was necessary.... my reasons for being administered the drugs to begin with was because I was depressed and not doing anything or going anywhere for a couple of years, on top of all of the pent up anger I have coming out in bursts at no particular person, but just because it was festering in my mind due to trauma. These bursts, mind you, were hurting no one (except maybe myself as I did not employ a different outlet). No one attempted to talk to me about my problems and instead the psychiatrist would only listen to when my mother spoke and she was the person who attacked me in a bathroom when I refused to come out when she kept demanding me to. I am aware that my behavior was abnormal however I was aware of my thought processes and am certain that proper therapy would have been a beneficiary, especially considering my actions were a side effect of hurting. Any input on this topic would be much appreciated.

Edit: I honestly feel like I am being way too tolerant of others' treatment of me and the unsureness of my context is actually really frightening. Tolerance is how I wound up in said position of depression. ",08Oct2017,1,

I was originally supposed to graduate with a degree in accounting but because my GPA was to low I had to switch majors. The reason for my low GPA was not because I found it too challenging, but because I couldn't motivate myself to do the work necessary to pass. One example was I had a low C in one of my classes and I knew I need to pass my final to pass the class. I forced myself to open the book to study, but no matter how hard I tried I couldn't do it. I used every excuse to get up and not do it . I don't know why I can't motivate myself. I really want to succeed, but when the time comes to put in the work to do so something stops me.

Just wanted to share my story, so for years I was abused, I denied it for years which ripped through my mind.

Ive had alot of nasty things done to me, alot of you could agree if you knew me, but it doesent bother me, I just wish to leave this message for all who suffer in silence, just honestly defeat your pride, go get help, google ""Mental Heath [area]"".

I am involved with a team called EIP, they really have helped me, so fucking much, yes I didnt agree with the tablets I was given but still they did kinda help.

But again, people who suffer in silence, who are not vocal about it need to just grow a pair and accept that their mind has destroyed everything about itself.

Finally, I have a multiple personality disorder, at least im being honest, ive spent years saying stupid things and well honestly I regret alot of them, but honestly if you knew me and what my friends have done to me then you would understand.

19,"Sorry this is a really rambling post, I'm not looking for a diagnosis or anything but I honestly feel like I'm going crazy, one of my friends has started to notice and I basically can't work out what my problem is and how bad/urgent it is. For maybe the past couple of years, I've been getting really severe mood swings, which have really gotten worse over the last 12 months. Sometimes it comes on really fast if someone's upset me or I think I've annoyed someone, and sometimes I just kind of sink into it for no apparent reason. But every time, I end up in a horrible depression - suicidal ideation, crying all the time, oversleeping etc etc. Can last anything from a couple of hours, a couple of days, longest maybe ~2months

Problem is it comes and goes so I never know when or if I need to see a doctor, and I always feel like I should only go if I'm right in the middle of feeling horrible because otherwise what can they do? Over summer I felt reasonably ok. Have just gone back to uni and I feel terrible again. I was actually going to see my doctor last monday but I felt ok the night before so I cancelled it. Lo and behold, my mood flipped again on friday. I've finally realised also I probably self-medicate a degree of social anxiety by binge drinking at the weekends which makes my moods 100x worse so I've decided to stop that. Now I'm wondering, are all of my mood swing brought on by alcohol? Am I being a timewaster for going to the doctors about this if all I really need to do is stop drinking?

I guess I'm just looking for some outside perspectives on whether I'm overreacting/what I should do. My mind has been running on and off for the better part of this year with what's wrong with me and I feel like I've considered everything from add to aspergers, bipolar bpd etc, but nothing seems to fit 100% of the time. I'm just sick of my life atm, I feel lazy, unproductive and like I'm wasting my brain, I don't seem to have the social skills to make and keep close friends and I'm so lonely all the time. I know something needs to change but because it's so on/off I can't tell whether I've actually got a problem or if it's self-inflicted and I just need to sort myself out",08Oct2017,1,

26,"In the past... well, I'm pretty sure I was a (bit) of a nice guy(tm). I was insecure. I thought me being nice made me better than the other guys. It was deep in my subconscious mind but I see that now. It's almost a form of narcissism. I missed out on a lot of things due to my obsessions. I'm not a pushover though. I know what I believe. I know what I like. I have my own taste in different things and I don't care if people make fun of me for that.  In that sense, I'm not a nice guy(tm). But I definitely had some of that in me.  I had a generally positive view of women.. BUT I didn't fall flat for all of them. I have rejected girls in the past because I didn't like something about them, though I'm generally pretty open. In that sense I'm not a nice guy(tm).  But maybe I was too nice. I don't know. My ex-girlfriend was actually pretty good to me.  I didn't consciously treat women ""nice"" to get sex or a romantic relationship either. I've had women as friends. In that sense I am also not a nice guy(tm).  Also, I don't give a damn what people (MRAs, radfems) say about romantic love and the eros love style. I like eros.

I took it easy, didn't freak out about it and act like an idiot. I just continued with my life, and left the ""find a girlfriend"" directive in the background since I was busy.

27,"So my partner has bad mental health issues, I knew this from the get-go. It hasnt bothered me because I know it isnt her fault and she is trying. Ive been very accomodating to her flaws like her sever angry lashing out, trying to stop her suicidal ideations, and taking the brunt of housework and feeding.

Lately she's declined even worse...like I said I always tried to be accommodating. Before she had a job, she got things done that needed to be done. Lately though she's been jobless for a year, recently got a new job which she lost within two weeks (She intentionally didnt go to work one day and missed that she was scheduled to work in the morning). I think her poor responsibility standards and lack of coping mechanisms have been doing her in. Ive urged her to see therapy in the past though shes lazy and wont bother keeping up. I wouldnt mind her being jobless, but she stays at home sleeping and playing videogames most days, and then gets made at ME when I dont tidy up and I work 8 hours 5x a week.Our intimacy has been poor because of her mental health, we dont have sex, which I could handle normally but in the past I havent even been able to cuddle either she just wont let me, she shuts me out.

I've been giving her chances, and I cant hold her hand and walk her through everything. I feel like for my sake I should leave, though at this time I cant do that and she's my dependant. She has nowhere to go and no job or money to support herself, her mother cant take her back because her home situation is tense and she's better off living away just so they dont fight (Her family is nice when they keep their distance, theyre not bad people and they love her they just dont see eye to eye politically and are catholic, which she hates)

I dont have any choice but to keep taking care of her while I finish school, and hope maybe that by that time she'll pick up and make some contributions in our relationship, regardless of what or how. I hate to abandon her because she took me in when I needed it, and I'd be an asshole to abandon her after all that. She did say several times its okay for me to move on, especially when she tried to kill herself several times. If things dont change within the next year or so, if Im financially stable by then, I might move out giving her part of the money to be paying rent...but then she's on her own, and after a few months if she doesnt figure it out how to make money she needs to move out. I've just been enabling her and she isnt being an adult.

Does anyone else have any other suggestions on what to do?

I was devastated but this and in the months that followed I attempted suicide several times. I also got in trouble and now have a caution because I tried to message her. I just wanted to get back together. I don't remember much about that time in my life as I was very mentally ill and not completely functioning; I barely rememver 3 months or my life. Other than feeling in constant panic . What's even worse is that she was abusive to me. For all those years she physically and mentally abused me. But I loved her. I loved her more than anything. But I can never talk to her again and I know things between us are over forever.

I've been trying for so long to get better with my mental health. I have been havibg professional help as well as medication for the entire last year. I have even been in a new relationship that I'm still in. I know im a disgusting person because I'm not over my last partner. But I know this person I'm with is special. I just can't get over my last partner. No matter what I do. Everyday is a struggle. And my ex is on my mind so much. I don't know what to do. I want to hate my ex partner for abusing me. And I want to move on and not care for her anymore. But I just can't. Please help me. I've been struggling more and more the last few months. Today I almost ended my life. But I can't tell anyone about it. The only person in my life who I can talk too about this kind of thing is my current partner. But it would be so disgusting to tell her that the main reason im suicidal is because I can't get over my last partner. Because I feel alone all the time.

I have the sudden urge to kill myself. It scares me. A lot. I mean, sex is supposed to feel good right? Idk if it has something to do with an ex who (I think) sexually harassed me. When me and my ex were still together, he will force me to have sex with him then gets mad if I refuse. He will then touch me everywhere which makes me feel very uncomfortable.

For the past 2 weeks I've been experiencing something quite odd and frustrating when it comes to my mental health. Im 19 and have taken LSD approximately 5 times in the past 2 months, including mushrooms and dmt within that time period as well. I believe it's important to mention I have been diagnosed with depression and OCD since I was 16, and tried these drugs with the intention of trying to introspect and find some meaning.
Basically, I'm having trouble prounouncing words in my head. It's really odd sounding I know, but my inner dialogue isn't smooth and sounds like a record with a skip in it. The words in my head get slurred and stuttered, and I get super worked up over this because it drives me mad. It's really debilitating, especially since I like to talk to think a lot in my head and go over various things. If I were to try to say ""That is a blue pen"" in my head, it would sound like ""tha-is--a-BLU penh"". The more complex the word, the more difficult it is to voice it in my mind. However, I'm capable of speaking out loud without much of a problem, so I'm really confused and frightened as to what this even is.

I realize that I need to cut out these drugs pretty much forever. I simply can't handle them anymore. I've also been experiencing odd headaches, and difficulty reading at a fast pace. I'm also really worried about my intelligence. It's extremely important to me now that my brain is working at its peak and that I can grasp difficult concepts and challenging things.

I did little bit better at uni but not so much.

I recently understood that at school my brain learned to trick itself into perceiving my own thoughts and feeling as thoughts and feeling of some other person. So it's like I 'know' what somebody feels or think while in fact that's my own thoughts and feeling. Like right know I'm writing this text and my brain generates reaction from 'you', the reader, and I get emotional 'feedback' so my desire to express myself is already satisfied by my own brain. I can erase all that text (do that a lot with comments) that I wrote cause my needs to share are already met by myself.  Maybe it was a way to 'belong' with the class group cause the reality was emotionally unbearable.

One time he was so close to being hit by a car going 50mph, and he just says ""sometimes in life you have to take risks"" in a joking way.  Other odd behaviours include binge eating, he eats and eats and doesn't care about his health.


I don't think he showers often (maybe once a week or so). I don't think he ever brushes his teeth either. He doesn't have a job, doesn't really care either, because he thinks if he has money he'll get feel happier and get better.


I've asked him why he doesn't try in anything, and he'll respond by saying things like ""why bother trying if we are all going to die"" or ""if I were to kill myself I won't have to worry about anything, and that seems a lot better than worrying about things"". It scares me with the things he says.


He has self harmed before, but it's really minor anyway.


He tells me he's transgender (he wants to be a girl). I know he takes hormones he has gotten some how (unsure how, we're from england and I think the pills are from spain). But then again he seems really transphobic. 




His parents seem like really nice people, but he says his parents are only like that when I'm around. He says to me that they ignore him. He's been really sad since 2012 and his parents have never noticed.


He's really poor as well. He is, not his parents. His parents never seem to give him money either. The only way of getting money is that his nan gives him £10 each time he goes there which is about once a month and from relatives at christmas and his birthday. He has so little money to the point where he counts every 1p or 2p he has. His entire savings is about £25. My parents give that to me in a month. He seems to have about 3 t-shirts, and always wears the same trousers. They are really cheap primark brands as well. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but he looks dreadful and doesn't care.






I don't know what to do any more. He's just spiralling out of control. He won't get help, we will refuse any if he were to get help, and the things he says about committing suicide worries me. What he says about his parents I'm not sure if it's true. 


I can't tell anyone, as he says if his parents were to find out about him (weather it's about being suicidal, transgender etc.) he would kill himself. I'm unable to tell anyone, but he's getting so much worse and I can't do anything about it, and I'm really worried. If he were to kill himself, what will happen afterwards? I'll be so sad and beat myself up for it. I will look guilty for not telling anyone, but if I tell someone and he kills himself I'll look guilty as I did something against him, meaning he will do it.

I'm studying in a shitty military college.

I have anxiety problems so I can't sleep, I can't eat, I can't do anything properly.

I'm 20 and I've gotten nowhere in life.

I want to move out but I can't.

I want to drop out of college but I invested too much time in it for it to be worth it.

I don't want to enlist but I've no choice.

I don't have a job.

I just want to start all over from scratch.

No one in real life or online wants to help me.

I've attempted suicide once.

Maybe I should attempt again.",08Oct2017,1,

I won't intentionally off myself but if a car was to speed down the road that I'm crossing, I wouldn't be in any sort of hurry to move out of the way. I'm bored and living is shit.

43,"I know there's quite a few subs for this but they limit the amount of info I can give so this is my next best option.

From the age of 5, I've been put on very strict diets. I struggled with child obesity for most of my younger years due to emotionally binge eating when nobody was home. I'm only about 168 cm tall (5""6) and last year, I weighed around about 81 kgs (178,5 lbs). After I came to the conclusion that I was going in a steady downward spiral, my dieting became serious. But I got obsessed with my weight and calories (lord Jesus I can calculate calories as easily as I can breathe) which resulted in me becoming a bit overbearing towards myself. At first I was decently healthy, I ate good food and drank lots of water and made sure to stick to exercise. But then I reached a plateau and gave up, as per usual. Then something changed. I became vegetarian and got into things again. That's when shit went down.

I reduced my calorie intake to 1000 a day, stayed away from carbs and calorie excessive foods. Slowly, I started getting worse. I skipped meals, left unfinished plates of food behind and sometimes purged when I needed to. For a couple months, I was surviving on 100-300 calories a day. I was at about 75-76 kgs (165-167 lbs).

Then exams came around and due to stress, the binge eating commenced.  I started climbing weight again, got scared and overworked myself through school, sport and exercise. 

Today, I weigh 69 kgs (152 lbs) and I only eat one meal a day. Maybe two if I feel like it. My appetite has vanished and I probably never eat over 700 calories. I always feel guilty about eating and there's always a voice in the back of my mind that scolds me whenever I even think about food. I still have roughly 10 kgs (22 lbs) to lose before I get to my goal weight. My eating habits seem normal to me now but I'm pretty sure they aren't to anybody else. 

I don't even know what I'm looking for here. I guess I just wanted to share. ",08Oct2017,1,
44,"I’ve never made my own reddit post before so i dont know where to begin. Sorry if I posted this in the wrong place. 

Basically I graduated uni in 2012, moved back home. I live in a small town where I’ve always felt trapped. I grew up with overbearing, overprotective parents. Any time I discussed moving away I’d be guilted  into staying. Things like “why don’t you love us anymore” or “how could you abandon us? What if we died?” And because my parents have financially supported me during uni, I get guilted about that too like “how can you be so ungrateful?” And when I try to discuss leaving with my brother who I thought might understand, he just turns around and tells me “don’t bother you won’t make it. You’re never gonna find a job out there. It’s unrealistic. Your life has been so easy you don’t know what it’s like to struggle. You won’t make it” 

So I had that pretty much consistently for 5 years give or take. And my depression and anxiety has gone up and down so drastically as well during this time. But it really came at a head when a few months ago my brother caused me to lose my chance of actually leaving for real. I don’t want to get into details but basically I needed a form done and I asked him to look into it because I was swamped at work for that month. I thought I could trust him but he told me the wrong information (on purpose? I dont know) and I lost the chance. I never felt so low in my life, even writing it right now is making my heart race. But by low I mean I wanted to die. I dont know if I would’ve ever gone through with it but I was convinced that this was it. I’d always be stuck here and be unhappy and I just wanted to stop existing. I wanted the pain to go away. Thankfully my best friend though a million miles away pulled me through it somehow. But of course to this day my family doesn’t know the extent of what happened and they laugh about my brothers ‘mistake’ like it didn’t nearly make me want to kill myself. 

Anyway I’m finally financially stable enough to leave and my family seems to be more supportive than usual. Except for 5 years I’ve been told all of that and now I’m terrified. I can’t bring myself to apply for any jobs outside of this place. I’m so paralysed by the fear that maybe they were right all along and that I’ll just fail no matter what so what’s the point in even trying?? 

I know I’m being foolish because I haven’t been genuinely happy since I left university. I haven’t felt free or alive for 5 years. I’ve been merely existing and if I stay here any longer I’m scared I’ll want to stop existing altogether. But god, why is it so hard to just push through this fear? 

I dont know why I’m posting here tbh. Maybe to vent. Or maybe for advise. Anyway thank you for reading all the same.",08Oct2017,4,
45,"I have had major depression for nearly ten years, I am an eagle scout, Army Veteran, and college educated guy who used to love volunteering. I'm doing well enough to leave my home and function well enough to start volunteering again. Since my depression began, I have closed myself off to the world, cut myself off from humanity in general. I even did my grocery shopping at night to avoid people. 

But as I sit here thinking of ways to give and contribute, the very idea gives me a sense of fulfilling joy as well as intense repulsion. 

Where is this sense of repulsion coming from? What does it mean and how do I overcome it?",08Oct2017,17,
46,"It's not really concerning for me, because it hasn't affected my life in any way, but is it normal to see small objects/marks move or shift?  

For example, I thought there was a slug inching across my floor for a second, but I looked closer and it was just a mark on my floor. There's no reason a slug would be in my room; this has never happened before.

I've also thought someone was shouting to me from a different room when they weren't. But at the time when that happens, I'm not 100% sure it's real.",08Oct2017,1,
47,"For years now, I've been going through several extreme highs and extreme lows within the span of a week. My highs are so intense that I feel like the king of the world and get giddy, funny, and social/talkative. During this state, I don't give two shits what people think of me.

Then, the slightest thing will set me off - someone ignoring my text, hearing someone trash me when they think I'm not listening - minor things that shouldn't affect me too much send me CRASHING. Suddenly I want to cry. I get socially awkward, low-energy, insecure, and just feel like shit. That's what I feel like right now.

The cycle just restarts when I do something as simple as eating Chipotle or listening to a good song/watching a good movie, which usually makes me ""normal"" (between the two states). Social outings make me ""high"", while scrolling through Snapchat stories of outings I wasn't invited to make me ""low"".

I'm not pregnant, nor am I PMSing. I've been like this for as long as I can remember. The lows are driving me insane, because they occur more frequently than usual nowadays - it's rough being tired, insecure, and socially awkward all the time. I've come to accept that this is probably Bipolar Disorder, but the ""mental illness doesn't exist"" mindset has been ingrained in my parents (despite the fact that my mom has it too).

They'd never buy me actual meds or get me help. That being said, are there natural ways to stop being bipolar? Any magical remedies I don't know about? I'm willing to do anything to just be consistently happy again.

48,"If I'm calm, I don't really care.
If I'm upset, I'm overreacting.
If I'm crying, I'm more upset than actively trying to help.
No matter what I do, I'm labeled as irrational and manipulative.
If I want help, it's a cry for attention, because no matter what I do it's about attention.
Is it too much for them to just listen?
I was just honest to the point where I cried. They laughed.
I'm afraid of putting this somewhere because it could be linked to me somehow(I made a new account just for this), and I don't want people thinking I'm hurting for attention. Attention isn't the issue. I'm just stuck. I can't figure out what I'm supposed to do anymore.
