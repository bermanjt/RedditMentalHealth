0,"Just needed to rant for a second I guess... my father is a good man who was very involved in our church for the past 20 years, preaching, singing &amp; bending over backwards for anyone who needed help. I've literally seen him give his shirt off his back to homeless people &amp; things such as that. 

My father has depression, OCD, &amp; PTSD from years of childhood abuse. He is on a lot of medications &amp; like most people with mental illness, he has his good days &amp; his bad days. 

Lately, the bad days have outweighed the good. His illnesses have impacted his work &amp; put his job in jeopardy which obviously pushes him deeper into his depression. On his days off of work he usually chooses to hangout at home with our family or catch up on sleep &amp; gets tired of social situations very easily when we're in public which is totally understandable. I hate seeing my once loud vibrant father fade away in front of me without being able to help. 

The worst part about all of this? The way his church is treating him. They act like he can just pray his illnesses away &amp; that the reason he is so depressed is because of missing church so often. I am so hurt &amp; angry by the way they are treating him. Here he is, a man who has helped the people in his congregation for years, receiving no support from those who supposedly care about him.  My father tries going to church &amp; instead of getting love/encouragement, he gets lectured &amp; preached at that his lack of faith is what causes his illness. 

Luckily I escaped that congregation a year ago &amp; I now attend a church that is loving &amp; open minded. But I feel awful for my dad &amp; I don't know what to do. It just makes a bad situation worse &amp; I feel helpless. 

Sorry for the rant. ",22Jun2017,2

4,"Hey, I'm not looking for a diagnosis, of course, but my relationship with food has been awful for the past 2 years and I have been wondering for almost half a year now, if my relationship with food is a result of an eating disorder I may or may not have. So I am looking for opinions, preferably from those who have had experience with an eating disorder (preferably Anarexia as that is what I'm suspecting...) though everyone is welcome. 

I will appreciate every single comment and opinion despite who it is from, and will also do my best to reply to any questions (if there are any) ASAP. I also want to apologise for any spelling or grammar mistakes I will likely make as I'm good at making those. And lastly, I want to apologise in advance as my story may be a bit all over the place due to my poor memory. 

- About me:

Female
 
Suspected it had began around age 14. I was 5ft 3 possibly and weighed 8st and 6 pounds. 

Currently I am 17 years old, and I am 5ft 4, weighing at 7st 10.

- How my bad relationship with food began (sorry if it's too long. It may not be necessary to read but I thought I would give a background brief for those who are wondering/if anyone is wondering how 'it' began):

So i suspect it began when I first got braces when I was for the age 14 and I was told of the restrictions I must follow such as no fizzy drinks, sticky sweets etc. I care a lot about my teeth (obsessed, so I've been called) so I ensured I refrained from consuming the mensioned foods and drinks. Though this wasn't the only reason as to why I refrained. I had previously had 3 fillings placed in my back molars due to cavities, despite the fact that I do brush twice everyday and floss every so often, though I recall I use to eat roughly 2 chocolate bars a day and alot of sugary food in general, so I assumed that was what caused 3 cavities. I remember feeling so ashamed and disgusted in myself, and my self esteem was low.

 All in all, as a result of the negative emotions I was experiencing and the adjustment I had to make as a result of getting braces fitted, I was able to completely cut out all sweets and chocolate from my diet as well as fizzy drinks (in which was a big part of my diet must I mention, though I was super determined as I was afraid of damaging my teeth anymore). 
And with that I lost 6 pounds. I went from 8st 6, to 8st after a month of no sweets and chocolate. (I'm sorry, I do not use pounds nor know how to translate stones into pounds as I live in England where stones are recognised/used more as a way of measuring weight).

Before cutting out sweets and chocolate and fizzy drink, my daily diet would be breakfast on some days (not all), lunch as long as if it was a school day, otherwise I would just eat a chocolate bar, biscuits and other unhealthy snacks, and I would have a regular meal (a take away usually on the weekend) during the evening and probably a snack afterwards. 

I would also like to mention thst before the teeth and braces ordeal, I remember feeling as though I was gaining weight and I wasn't very happy with the way it was going, especially my arms as they were incredibly chubby and my problem area. Again, this was at the age of 14, not too long before the teeth and braces ordeal, and it was the age I began considering my physical appearance, in which I suddenly found repulsive by my own standards (triggering a super low self esteem, no confidence etc), and I began wearing make up as a result, if that matters at all. 
Though I had no motivation to lose weight at this time , as much as I tried anyway; it wouldn't be long before I was back to my old ways. So I guess I can say that I had wanted to lose weight before the teeth and braces thing came along, though I had no motivation up until the teeth and braces ordeal, in which then I felt as though I had no choice but to stay away from sugary snacks and I successfully did. 

- Where the problem truly began (again, I'm sorry if it is too lengthy. I'm not too good at explaining thoughts, feelings etc., due to not being naturally expressive though mostly due to the fact I simply don't like discussing them. But, here we go):

As of this point, now that I had cut out chocolate and sweets for the safety of my teeth, I had also began cutting out biscuits and all other snacks I use to enjoy as I thought to myself, 'if I'm going to continue eating biscuits and ice cream (etc) what is the point in restricting yourself from chocolate and sweets?'. I'm not sure if that's logical or understandable from another person's point of view, but it made sense to me. So I did so, again, immediately and successfully. 

I also began receiving compliments as people, mostly my family, began noticing my weight loss. Before the weight loss I had never (or atleast I don't recall) recieved compliments from anyone before. This made me feel good, of course, and I guess encouraged me to continue with the restrictions I had put up for myself.

By this point, my daily diet consisted of breakfast, lunch on school days, if not, nothing unless there was fruit in the house, and then a meal during the evening. I imagine my daily calorie intake by this point was roughly 1500, which I didn't nor do currently, believe thst is bad at all. I have never truly been a physically active person as I tend to lay in bed all day though even more so when I was 14 to 16 (not very social, nor wanted to be; I tend to like being alone and left alone though that is not necessarily the case as it will be discovered further on I guess), so I never felt the need to eat the recommended calorie intake for a girl of my age. I stand by this still. 

Anyway, I noticed that my chubby arms were less chubby after I lost the weight in which I was more than pleased about, though I still didnt feel entirely satisfied either. It was at this point my restrictions thst were originally put in place to protect my teeth while I had braces, became the result of me trying to lose weight. 

There came a point where I came to a halt and I stopped losing weight despite successfully avoiding sugary snacks. This was frustrating as I was enjoying seeing the number drop every week each time I weighed myself. It made me feel successful for once and somewhat satisfied (though not enough i guess). So I began skipping lunch on school days. By this point, you can probably see where this is going... 

I never saw a problem in skipping lunch for many reasons. I was doing just fine without it (up until a certain point) and because I wanted to lose weight and as I had learned after restricting myself of sugary snacks: restricting = weight loss. 

I feel as though I have already said enough for anyone who is reading this to understand where exactly this is going so I'm going to cut it as short as possible from this point onwards. I don't mean to ramble at all.

- short description of how it progressed and where I am now:

I eventually also cut out breakfast completely too, so thst I was only having 1 meal a day. I also found thst I had an extreme phobia of foods that are considered junk foods, and foods that are generally high in sugar, saturated fat and salt. It got to the point where I was only eating tuna and rice for the single meal I had everyday, and an estimate of 2 glasses of milk. Whenever I felt hungry, I would sleep as it helped though this resulted in me sleeping a lot for not only that reason, but because I was always tired no matter how much I slept. I had no energy but at the time, I never nailed it down to the fact that it was due to how little I was eating (roughly 400 calories a day). I would also like to quickly mention thst I began counting calories, and If i counted thst I had eaten over 1000 calories in one day, I would feel hugely guilty and fat. 
I guess how I was feeling is an important factor to mention. Whenever I would successfully fight the hunger, I felt successful. My family by this point noticed my lack of eating and whenever they did see me eat, they would cheer almost sarcastically and praise me, though this only made me feel guilty and like a failure. I would feel tempted to make myself sick, but I knew the effect it could have on my teeth. The thought of damaging my teeth was enough to put me off the idea.  
 
Eventually at my worst I weighed 6st 10 pounds And I was by this time 5'4 in height. I physically saw myself as thin by this stage ( though not an unhealthy type of thin) yet I felt fat anyway, especially when I would bloat after eating one meal (I thought it was a sign I was gaining weight). though now thst I think back, I was literally skin and bones. My family use to tell me so, but I never took too much notice. occasionally I would cry because no one was accepting of the fact that I was where I wanted to be; only my friends who told me they were jealous of how thin I had become (which was encouraging. Though I never understood why they were 'jealous' as I truly felt/feel hideous and did even more so back then, and because my friends are beautiful. I couldn't nor do I now understand why they ever wanted my body type/shape. Basically I'm not happy with myself and my self esteem was and is still incredibly low).

 Though even so, I had no idea how to stop so I continued restricting and starving myself as I thought that that was the only way I could possibly maintain the weight I was at.
And then came the day I collapsed. I was walking into the kitchen as I felt incredibly weak and couldn't walk in a straight line nor see clearly and was desperately in need of something to eat. I had to sit on the floor for the time I was waiting for the rice to cook in the microwave and then I had to pull myself back up using the counter top, as I would have tumbled over if I hadn't used anything for support. And as I walked through the living room with my food where my mum was, I tried to remain normal so she wouldn't worry, but ended up tripping up the stairs as I climbed the 3rd step, due to blurry vision and unable to walk properly. I hit my hip bone and my head but I don't remember feeling the pain as I was blacking out. The best I can describe it is thst my eyes were open, yet all I could see was darkness. 

This is when I realised or atleast suspected that I had a problem.. Since then I have been trying to help myself and have been ensuring that I eat at least 2 meals a day, sometimes 3. Thoigh I'm still weary of junk food and have not touched a chocolate bar and biscuits (and other specific foods that I never really cared fro to begin with anyway) for 2 years now, and counting. 

My long distant boyfriend who I have been with for 6 months now has helped a lot, despite him being unaware of it (I have talked to him about it in fact, but he doesn't seem to understand in which is okay. Intellectually I know thst what I did and currently do is not exactly normal except I do it anyway for emotional, mental and physical reasons I suppose). recently he encouraged me to eat sweets with him for the first time in 2 years. I now eat sweets and takeaways but only during the time I am with him, which is around once every month (due to it being a long distant relationship). Otherwise, I am still banned from eating junk food and snacks. Though that's not entirely correct, as if I feel as though I have been 'good' and if I have not eaten a lot in the past few days, I will make an acception and allow myself to have the odd takeaway, though not without feeling guilty and fat afterwards... My self esteem is still as low as it was except I no longer care enough to put make up on everyday as I use to do (even when I knew I was only going to be home all day). I also no longer have braces so I no longer have a reason to restrict certain foods from my diet but I do still. I also still have an issue with my arms. Though they are still much slimmer than they were when I was 14 they are not as thin as they were when I was 6st 10 in which bothers me. 


But anyway, I'm sure I have spoken way too much and have given more than enough information for someone to work off, even though i'm sure I could go on to say a lot more... Though if not, I am willing to answer questions asap. :) 

Thank you to anyone who has bothered to read this and to anyone in advance, if they decide to comment. I just feel as though I need answers and an explanation as to why I feel this way. It seems no matter how wrong and abnormal I know my behaviour towards food is, I can't help but listen to myself and refrain from eating certain foods. And the fact that I know I'm slim and yet I go through phases of feeling fat and gross despite the scales telling me I weigh exactly the same (7st 10); it's draining and frustrated. 

Again, thank you and I hope to hear from someone &lt;3


Edit: thank you very much for the responses so far. I wrote this at 2am and have read it back this morning to feel as though I have missed a few small, yet what I think are important points in which I will touch up on later. I am currently busy though later on, I will be back with a small update on the things I missed out, that I believe to be somewhat important in the whole ordeal. 

Thank you &lt;3",22Jun2017,2
6,"Ok so i am wondering if this is normal? I was really surprised by a friend's FB post. Basically, a day or so after giving birth to her first kid there was a post about ready and wanting some alcohol. I don't have an issue with the occasional drink. But I am just wondering if she might have a problem if she is cravings alcohol after being sober for 9 months. I don't know of anyone else that felt that way after giving birth to their first kid.

8,"hey,

feeling sad, like I couldn't understand my problems.  so they started because of my removal from a sports team.

It bit my pride.  I shrugged it off.  I did another sport, fearing I'd get taken off.  That was stress.

I still did a sport I grew up with, but, still stressful.

I worried about not competing.  That I'd hang on the sidelines, because I wasn't good enough.

That tortured me.

I got taken off the 4 by 200m relay team, replaced by a girl my sister said wasn't fast.  So I grew jealous.

I was angry.

I focused on long jump and 4 by 100m relay.

I grew tired.  The scene they made about kicking me off for deaf deaf didn't faze me.

I just wanted something.

To sustain me.

To love me.

I was hungry and thirsty for that, the pride and the ability to know and then to succeed.

To show I can.

And then, as I grew sick, I humbled myself and smiled, knowing that it was time to rest, and then, when I'm ready, I'll know-

it'd be with the right mindset.",22Jun2017,2

10,"God, I don't even know where to start. I have a strong history of metal illness and addiction in my family. Mother's side has bipolar disorder, father's side has schizophrenia. My first diagnosis was when I was about 15. Court mandated therapist said I had dysthypia, but it was probably situational. I had my first panic attack when I was 17, though I had no idea what it was or why I was sobbing uncontrollably in a restaurant bathroom for seemingly no reason. The next public panic attack was when I was 19. I guess I was always depressed, anxious, and isolating, but I thought that was just being a teenager. 

I was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder later in my 19th year. I started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist once or twice a month at my university. I was attending a prestigious college on a full-ride scholarshipthat also included really good health insurance. We found medications that helped some. 

Then when I was 20 my anxiety got really bad. I did really well in classes, when I could make myself get up and go. I had horrible anxiety attacks about most assignments and my coping method is avoidance. Spring semester I just couldn't handle it, stopped going to one class, then didn't write my final essays in 2 others, so I flunked out. Lost health insurance, was too poor for ACA, but made too much for Medicaid. Struggled for a couple years, got back into school and finished my last semester, then lost health insurance again. Was diagnosed with ADD at this time. 

As soon as I graduated, my husband and I moved back to our homestate. He had taken some community college courses but had put his education on hold so I could finish my degree. I chose a big city for us to move to based on it having a good college for him to attend and full of confidence that I would land a good job in no time. Didn't happen, I made big plans and we crashed and burned. So now a year later we're in a lot of debt, broke, and scrounging our way in our small home town. 

I had a consulting session with the free mental health place here and the counselor said he could see signs of hypomania in me. Mom says for sure I have manic episodes, and I know I do too. So I guess I have Type II Bipolar Disorder? I was turned away from the free healthcare clinic, so I've been a year without seeing a psychiatrist. I've been managing to get pills regularly to take, but no one has really looked at or evacuated them in a couple years. [Lexapro, Wellbutrin, Trazedone, Temazapam, and Melatonin]

*   *   *

I've just hit rock bottom in life. I've failed everyone. All of my decisions have been wrong. I think a lot of that had to do with hypomania overconfidence, like no thought of failure ever crossed my mind. I still haven't landed a decent job. I'm unemployed again and helping Mom clean houses for a bit of cash. I'm secretly depressed and just want to drink all the time, but my husband won't let me because I drink until I can't feel my legs. Straight from the whisky bottle. We can't afford that anyways. I feel like even applying for jobs is pointless. I've been rejected so many times. I have a good resume, and I'm great in interviews, but it's like no one even looks at my applications. I'm completely useless. I cook maybe once every couple weeks because I have anxiety attacks. Or I buy groceries and can't make myself get up and use them, so they go in the trash and I feel like crap. I just pace around the house, losing attention in one thing after another, feeling nauseous and gritting my teeth because I'm so mad at myself for not doing anything I'm supposed to do. 

My husband doesn't understand metal illness at all. He tries to be supportive, but he thinks if I get fit it'll fix all my problems, and that pills aren't supposed to be taken everyday long term. I explain to him I can't help how I am, I'm miserable all the time and I'm doing my best but I don't know how to get better. I don't know how to make myself stop stressing about things and just DO them. I haven't been happy in so long. I used to be so strong and confident, and my mom and husband say they miss the old me. I do too. 


TLDR: Life is shit, how do I not be shit?

13,"I was fired from my last job because my attention wandered too regularly. My boss didn't think my heart was in the work (he wasn't entirely wrong). I was excited to have my job though, because it paid well and I had medical. I never got a chance to use it though. I was on Adderall in college, but now that college is over I lost my insurance and cold turkeyed. 

In my opinion, the medical system in America is so screwed up. I have to hold a job steadily to get insurance to get the treatment I need to treat my symptoms so I can hold a job without weirding my bosses out or frustrating them to the point of dismissing me. 

My ADHD symptoms combine with my anxiety to create a lot of difficulty conversating with people, keeping eye contact, focusing on my work, and keeping my mood stable.

I don't even feel sexually aroused watching porn. it all stems from fantasizing about an intimate relationship. even getting a text from a girl is enough to set me off, and if a girl asks me to hang out...oh man, total euphoria

 is this like a defense mechanism due to depriving myself of intimacy?",22Jun2017,1
18,"When I was a little kid, maybe around 8 years old, I developed a fear of death, which bordered on paranoia. I remember going to bed terrified that I wouldn't wake up. Some people may say I was just a weird kid, but I think this is where my mental health issues really began. 

When I was 13, I lost that fear of death, but unfortunately it was replaced by an obsession with death. For the whole of my teenage years, I obsessed over where I would go if I chose to end my life, and constantly dwelled on what the point of life was. 

Now, at 22 years old, I no longer have a fear of death, nor an obsession with it. I don't know what changed, or when, all I know is I've gotten my will to live back. That's not to say I don't still get depressed, my depression is going to be a lifelong battle, this is a fact that I feel I am now mature enough to accept. 

Now I battle what I call a fear of living. I go Day by day, simply surviving, because I'm afraid to make a big decision that might change my life, out of fear that I will screw up. I'll have days where I say to myself ""yeah! I will do the thing and it will be awesome!"" But I go to sleep and think ""what if I do the thing and fuck everything up? I better not do the thing.""
This is a daily struggle. I want to live, but I don't know how. I'm sure people without mental health issues have this doubt, but for me I feel it's crippling my life. But I won't quit. I'm done surviving. I'm ready to live. I want to wake up and say ""today I will do the thing!"" And goddamnit I am going to do the thing, and not worry about the results. 

Overthinking, to me, is an illness in and of itself. And just like my OCD, my depression, my schizoaffective disorder, and my autism, I have to fight it like I would a physical ailment. I'm ready to throw away my fear and start living. I'm ready to do the thing.",22Jun2017,4

Even here I feel like I'm just giving anyone who reads this a sob story and it makes me hate myself even more. I feel like a burden to people, and I irritate myself so much. I think I want help but I'm rubbish at accepting it and I don't think I deserve it either at this point. ",22Jun2017,2

30,"I had no clue where my life was going and was freaking out but at the same time i didn’t care either. I had myself fooled into believing that drinking my days and nights away was the
only thing I had in life.

I started drinking around 15, once in a blue moon, just a few cans. 16,a few times a month, a few cans more. 17, 1/2 times a week, a few cans more. 18 3/4 times a week, a few cans more.
I moved abroad at 20 years of age. I brought $2,200 with me in my pocket that i drank in less than 2 weeks in the first pub I found.  I got a job bartending but served no body more than myself. The pub was brand new and they didn’t have much staff so i worked a lot. Id open at 11am and close at 1am. At the start I’d wait until the evening to have a drink while i was working but eventually id be having an orange juice with vodka in the morning. On days i only worked the day shift, as soon as my shift was done at 6:30 id move to the other side of the counter and drink myself stupid till 1 an then find out where the lock in was that night and carry in till sometimes 5 or 6 in the morning. I was making sometimes over $1,000 a weelk, big step up from collecting 180 odd euro a week on the dole in Ireland.

 

On my first move to America i stayed for a year and a half, out of all of them nights i was sober 3 nights and that was only because i was in hospital for falling drunk and hitting my head. As soon as i checked myself out I went straight to the pub. The hangovers in the morning started to get worse and worse. Whats the best thing for a hangover? The cure. So id get to work and id have a drink to steady myself. Soon it’d take 4 or 5 pint glasses of rum and coke just to stop the shakes in my hand.

I’d found a group of Irish lads to drink with who were all older than me and a good few of them were basically living in pubs but i told myself that would never be me. It already was. On my days off a friend of mine and I would go out at 10:30 in the morning to the place he managed, drink while the bartender set up, then we’d hit 3 or 4 pubs before 1pm. Then head to a local watering hole where you had to basically be a member to get in. You could smoke, beers were $2.50, you served yourself and left the caps in front of you so you could pay at the end. When you asked for shots they’d leave the bottle in front of you and ask you at the end how many you had and you were trusted to be honest. It was heaven. I’d sit there till about 8 or 9, when the place closed, drink all day and smoke between 60-80 cigarettes.

 

Then id head to the bar i worked at, already absolutely out of it, most of the time id make myself throw cause in my head it meant i could drink more and then id carry on drinking  till well after closing.
I had some taxi drivers friends of mine knew who’d bring all of us home dirt cheap. One in particular, an Egyptian lad used to carry me up the stairs and put me into bed half the time cause id be passed out in the back of his car the whole way home. On nights he could wake me I’d often wake up the next morning on the kitchen floor or the bathroom floor or even outside our front door.
The group of people i had made friends with all began telling me they were worried about me and that i needed to dry out. I told em to stop talking nonsense. Before i got anywhere near as bad as I got a good friend of mine came to visit me for a bit and saw what i was up to and told me something that still makes me feel ashamed “Do you want to go home to your Mother in a body bag” but sure I was only a young lad having fun. Then why didn’t it feel like fun?

 

I missed my family, my head was fucked from being drunk all the time, i rarely ate cause id just throw it up, i rarely showered, i was completely miserable. I went to a doctor looking for some kind of pills and that’s just what i got. He prescribed me some Xanax which id take and then throw vodka down on top of. I stopped showing up to work, so I ran out of money. I couldn’t pay rent, i couldn’t afford food, but i always found ways to get drink. One night, after already drinking the contents of my cop roomates alcohol press I went to the kitchen and drank the cooking wine. I’ll never forget the taste of that as long as I live. I had no desire to find another job, i felt worse and worse every day, and had no desire to even go on at that point and ended up back in the hospital. They suggested I go to some AA meetings but not long after that hospital visit i packed my bags and got on a flight home my parents paid for.

 

I arrived home, went back to the $180 dole and drank it away. I didn’t drink every night as I was living at home and didn’t have the money for it. I’d go out on the weekends and maybe 2 nights during the week id go visit friends, sleep on their couch and drink some cans. On the weekend I’d go out, get drunk then go looking for fights. I usually ended up in one. One night i got arrested for the 3rd time and was thrown in a cell for a few hours, when they let me out they handed me a piece of paper with a summons to appear in court. My court date came and the judge, who referred to me as a thug, fined me 300 euro and told me if he saw me again id face jail time.
That was a wake up call.
Around the same time my I had been to my Doctor as i had not been feeling well at all. He did tests and found out my liver is showing signs of damage and that he i may have something more as my body was a disaster inside and out. He spoke about Hepatitis A and that i should be prepared to deal with it as he felt the next round of blood tests would show I had it. I was in shock. 22 and my liver is showing signs of damage and I could have a serious disease. I went back for further tests over the next few months and had slowed my drinking down a lot and he said my body was showing signs of recovery. Luckily i didn’t have any disease, let alone Hepatitis. My body was just suffering from being so abused.
Another wake up call.

 

I moved to Galway, and in with the friend of mine who had visited me in The States. I was still drinking and there’s a video from the night of my 23rd birthday that is haunting. It’s me at home after the pub, i was carried into the house from the taxi and hit the floor once we got inside. I got up, barely able to walk and took a swing at one of the lads who lived in the house.  My friend started opening my eyes to living healthy and healthy eating. I stopped drinking and began eating healthy and taking care of myself. My body felt great, the clouds began to leave my mind and I started to see clearly.  After awhile, he moved out and i was left with the drinker of the house, of course, being easily led astray i was soon back on the booze. Just the two of us in the house we drank like fish. One weekend, he left 2 slabs of Bulmers and a bottle of Captain Morgan he took from his parents pub in the house on the Friday and went home. Told me he’d be back on Sunday night and we’d have a few cans.
Just me, in the house all weekend, with 48 cans of cider (which i didn’t like) and a bottle of rum. He came back on Sunday night an all he found were empty cans and an empty bottle of Rum.

 

That weekend was the worst and best weekend of my life. The thoughts that went through my head scared me. I felt that this was gonna be my life forever. I had distanced myself from all of my friends, I felt there was no hope for me to lead a normal life let alone succeed in anything, At the start being drunk helped the anxiety but now it was something that had complete control over me and the only way it was going to end was I’d end up in jail, with a serious disease or dead. I was as low and as lonely as I’d ever felt that Saturday night when for some reason I reached out to a friend for help. That person is long overdue a thank ypu for the support and advice they offered that night. It helped me greatly.
I woke up that Sunday morning and something just clicked in my head. That was it, Id had enough, enough of feeling depressed, enough of drinking my life away and enough of feeling hopeless and  miserable. I thought that these feeling and this situation has complete control over me, no, no it doesn’t. I’m going to take control of it.
I moved back home with my parents, started eating healthy and chasing the natural clean living buzz my friend had introduced me to. I started going to the gym and taking care of myself. My mood got better, my skin looked better, the clouds that had re-entered my mind had gone again. I saved up some money, moved back here to the States, got myself a job, met a wonderful, smart, beautiful woman who has helped me focus on what I really want in life. Her and her daughter are now my family and we are now expecting our first child together. I am incredibly happy to be here for this experience and I am so excited for the future. Too often I waste my time complaining about what I don’t have and need to remind myself of all I do have. I am now off the drink and cigarettes over 3 years and it’s the best thing I’ve ever done for myself. I have gone from above 17 stone to 12 stone and am working on improving my physical and metal health every day.
I have plans to start my own business and some other projects I am working on.

 

I have learned many things from this experience.
I used to think there was no hope. There’s always hope.
I used to think I’d never succeed, I’m going to succeed.
I used to think there is nothing worth sticking around for, I have so much that I am thankful for.
The buzz I get off of eating a plate of chicken, brown rice and broccoli after smashing a workout in the gym is a million times better than a bottle of vodka and a pack of rollies.
Sore muscles are way better than a pounding headache after 15 pints.
Not being able to walk or sit after leg day is way more enjoyable than getting hit with the fear the day after a heavy drinking session.

The point of me telling my story is to let you know no matter what you go through or however bad life may seem there is always light at the end of the tunnel. There should be no shame in speaking out when you feel sad or down or depressed or however you want to classify it. A family memember, a friend, whoever it may be will be glad to listen and help you. People do care about you and you are not alone however much it may seem like it. You may think you’re a complete outsider and weird because no one else feels the way you do. But trust me, too many people feel the same way. A lot of people have just gotten really good at hiding it and putting on a happy mask for the world to see.

However bad things may seem and however out of control of your life you may feel right now, I promise you there’s a better tomorrow if you want it.",22Jun2017,7
31,"So I've had really really bad back pain for many years, a few months ago I decided to move out of my house from my family because the enivornment was very depressing for me(diagnosed with major depression). My back pain disappeared but I didn't give it much thought till I came over to visit recently and after months of no pain suddenly it's back and hurts like hell now..which I find weird because I haven't had any pain the past months after leaving.

So I was wondering if and how is this connected since the timing seems too good for it to be just a coincidence. ",22Jun2017,16
32,"Hi,
I mostly enjoy any one's luck. I love to protect the ones whom I love the most. But I caused three children to get injured badly (because they literally ruined my life) and caused my teacher to take suicide. The worst thing is, I was 8 à 10 years old. Now I'm fourteen and my old habits might come back. I almost wanted to beat the shit out of the bff of my crush, bcz I didn't know they played. I basically thought he hurt her, but they were playing. Am I a bad person?",22Jun2017,2
35,"My PTSD and the depressive side of my bipolar have been kicking my butt lately. Anyone have any favorites for a self-care day they recommend? 

It's always most frustrating when I can't point to anything in my life that's triggering these, things are going well, my brain is just deciding not to cooperate in the good vibes. ",22Jun2017,1
36,"I still remember your goofy grin, that quirky smile that caught my eye.

I still remember your hand in mine, your strong arms holding me tight.

I remember I teased you about wearing your socks to bed and hogging all of the blankets.

I remember your smell, though it’s been years since we’ve embraced.

I remember the sound of your voice and the taste of your kiss.

I remember how we were so close, but always so far away.

I remember drifting apart.

I remember the rush each time when talking to you out of the blue and the sadness I felt when we our communications once again fell silent.

I remember the joy of being your friend.

I remember how I pushed you away when you needed me the most…

I remember…

I’m sorry

37,"Just started Lexapro on Tuesday. Today I called my dr because what started out as razor burn is now definitely hives and spreading. I've been given a new prescription for Celexa which I am to start tomorrow....but it has the same potential side effects. 

I don't want to be on SSRIs anymore at all but my doctor definitely doesn't want me on just a benzo. I'm getting annoyed with myself. I should have just stayed with the Zoloft but I was relying too much on the Klonopin so this is what we're moving away from. 

Every time we start something new it's so frustrating wondering if the week or two of start up effects are going to be worth it. ",22Jun2017,5
38,"Recently I have been pretty sick for like the past 2 weeks, and randomly I would get this weird thing happening in my mind, and it seems to want me to do things I don't want to do. If I don't want to do them, I pretty much do the craziest things, it's hard to remember cause it's like something has like overcome me. It's happened three times within the past 2 weeks. It's only happened when I'm sick, never happened before. It's really scaring me. ",22Jun2017,2
41,"Basically every medication I am on has excessive sweating as a side effect. And, boy, do I sweat excessively. I'm not sure how many of you deal with this, but if anyone is remotely like me: listen up.
In winter, I am a puddle. In summer, I am an ocean. Face, chest, back, armpits, anywhere I have skin, I sweat. My knees sweat. *My fucking knees*. 
I've searched far and wide for a solution. I've tried every antiperspirant, spray, gel, solid, homeopathic remedies, moisture wicking clothing, etc. I even tried a medication specifically to reduce sweating. No luck. 
**But I finally found my savior**. I found something on amazon called Odaban. There were other similar products that I will likely try at some point so I can see what's best, but Odaban is the one I decided to order. It's a spray that you put on before bed once or twice a week and it makes you less/not sweaty. I'm not sure I'm allowed to post a link, so you can just look it up on amazon. This isn't a promotional thing, it just happens to have been a life saver for me. It's not in available in America so it had to be shipped from the UK for me. If you're in America or another country that doesn't have it, expect it to take several weeks to come in. But it was worth it.
Hopefully this saves some other sweaty people from having to change their shirt 3x a day.",22Jun2017,4
43,"I been having a lot of crap... I have manic depression  AAHD and Aspergers,  ever since I have been diagnosed with it my family has treated me bad, or rather they treat me like as I was normal and expected me to BE normal, they put a lot of pressure on me, and lashed on me when my behaviour was not normal or I asked something 'stupid' or acted what is not considered 'normal' my likes of Japanese animation and the like, I kept my grades up but then I got a real bad heartbreak due to a girl whom I asked out and later called me after 2 hrs of me waiting on a themepark with her friends laughing at me saying that she couldn't belive that I thought that I had an actual chance with her. This happened to me a year later when I made homemade chocolates for a girl I had a crushard,  but she threw them to the trash in front of the whole class.
Later after I managed to graduate high school,  I decided to follow my dream to become a video game designer, however after my second year I was forced to quit college due to a problem with an English teacher who constantly failed me on purpose due to her being a Muslim,  man hater and because she could due to her having tenure, I complained but it was much easier to kick me out than to deal with her... my family just says that is was due to me being lazy, even tough I woke up at 4 am to take 3 busses to reach my college on time... I am reminded of that failure everyday... rubbed into my face. Not only that but they treat me like Crap,  insulting me, denigrating me... making me feel like I am nothing... once I was told this ""why don't you just kill yourself and get it over with""... this is what I get from my mother, whom I saved from being killed from my father who wanted to burn her alive and use me as an accomplice... yet I am always called a monster and a beast because I stopped caring about things and people and even shut a lot of my emotions to deal with the daily pain and sadness",22Jun2017,2
44,"I've been dating a girl for nearly 2 months now. It's going well, we are on the same wavelength, we kissed, we made love, however, there were also hiccups. She says she is not sure, unstable (she doesn't strike me as unstable at all; I guess she meant not sure) and that she thinks she may not be happy in the future. When she is with me she says she feels good and happy.
I'm trying to figure out what's making her say she may not be happy. She worries a lot. I don't. I told her I want her to go for it or we stop. She started crying.
She had a long relationship (10 years) that she ended because she wasn't sure she was going to be happy. Come on! Does that take you 10 years to figure out? I don't want this to happen to me.
She has no kids, wants 1 or 2 kids, me too.
She has had no traumatic events in her childhood, parents still married, nothing out of the ordinary.
Maybe fear of commitment?",22Jun2017,2
51,"I'm a 16-year-old boy and I’m very obsessive, I have a brother who is 1 year younger than me
1.	I have always been ugly, but my brother was born lucky and very handsome. As a result, I have been the weird and obsessive kid, and he has always been the socially-open kid that everybody loved more, even my family (When they asked my grandmother about her grandchildren, she said that I was not her or she left me and introduced my brother. In addition to this, my cousins pay me much less attention than my brother

2.	At age 11, I began to notice that I was ugly, and I wanted to change my physique to look better. At the cost of cutting calories I became anorexic at age 12 I'M NOT EXAGGERATING (I REMOVED GREAT PART OF SUGARS AND FATS FROM MY DIET)

3.	When I was 12 (2014) I fell in love for the first time because she (my crush) was the first girl to put aside my physical appearance and worry about me (While the other girls treated me poorly or they ignored me, she defended me and paid me attention). As I was pretty “In love”, I tried to impress her, but it didn’t work, because she ended up ""hating"" me. Now a day, her personality is very different (adolescence I guess) and she has a crush on my brother

4.	At age 13-14 (2015), when I was about to participate in the championship of Spain triathlon, I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that basically destroys your joints, and because of that, I had to stop running and cycling. Therefore, I lost 15 kg, and I became extremely anorexic. (To this day, the disease prevents me from even swimming, since it has spread all the joints on the left side of my body). 

5.	I have lost everything, I thought. Due to my obsessive personality, I decided to Focus my attention on getting good marks when I was 14 (2016), and on being intelligent (By that time I slept 4-5 hours a day), and I managed to be among the best students of my course. But not everything was rosy. Because of sleep lack, I slowed down my growth 

6.	Due to my anorexia, I ended up on 9% bodyfat, and I lost interest of everything. (2016)

7.	During 2016 and 2017, girls started feeling interested on my brother (asking his number, if he was single), while I they left me alone. Apart from that, he has managed to get the minimum times that allow him to go to the Spain swimming championship

8.	After bulking up a bit, I decided that it would be a great idea to inject steroids (because they also work to attract girls, since they are a derivate form masculine hormones). Finally, at the age of 15 (2017), I ended up injecting testosterone. After developing my body during the cycle, I realized that the cycle could have affected my final growth (And I was right, because I haven’t grown in 6 months). Now a day, I’m 180cm and my brother is 182cm
All of this has made me feel depressed, my self-esteem is very low, and I feel sad all-day long. Due to this, I make my family feel bad (because I’m not motivated to do anything), and the other day my mother told me this: DO YOU KNOW WHICH IS YOUR PROBLEM? You're a shit and you're not a man

I love my brother, but I don’t know what the hell I can do
