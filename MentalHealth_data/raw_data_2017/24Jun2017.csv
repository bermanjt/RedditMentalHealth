0,"Two nights ago I had a pretty bad argument with my parents. I was trying to tell them how shitty I felt and why... explaining that I do have suicidal ideations. I said something along the lines of ""maybe I should just kill myself"", and my father told me I have his permission to do so, if that's what I really want. I was also told I'm soulless for not believing in the same religion they do. How do I get over this? Unfortunately I still live at home and I am trying to do everything I can to find a job that will pay enough for me to move out. ",24Jun2017,3
1,"Hey there! Never posted here but I'm hoping I may be able to get some advice. 

I (F23) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (F22) for five years. Recently, my girlfriends depression has become far worse and she dipped into suicidality (which she was hospitalized for). She got out a week and a half ago and was put into a day program for her eating disorder. Before she got into the day program a couple days ago I was spending 24/7 with her to make sure she's okay 

 here's the problem: neither of us speak to our families and therefore we are the only support system either of us have. I have ADHD that is still untreated and it makes it really hard for me to even take care of myself, let alone another person. She keeps getting upset because she doesn't feel supported through this really tough time, which I understand. I feel really helpless because I'm trying really, really hard to be there for her but It's not enough. I guess these are my questions:

What are some things I can do to make her feel more supported? 

How can I keep myself from becoming more depressed when I'm around her? I love her and we've been together five years. She has had major depressive disorder the entire time. Sometimes I can't help but to avoid being around her, especially when I'm having a really good day. 

How do you build a support system when you don't have a family? I feel as though being the only person in her support system isn't enough. I'm giving all I can and it isn't enough to help her.

Should I talk to her about these feelings or should I keep them to myself? I don't want to upset her more than she already is. 

Thanks in advance guys",24Jun2017,3
2,"So basically I'm fucked and I think I should kill myself. But I can't. Partly because I'm a coward but mostly because of my family. I keep imagining the effect it would have on them and how miserable it would make them. But the irony is that having me around is making them miserable as well. I know they would be far more miserable if I killed myself but at least I wouldn't be suffering as well and maybe, after a long time they'd move on. I don't know.

Anyway, the reason I'm thinking of killing myself is actually fairly complicated. Basically I've fucked up my life irredeemably. Things have never been great for me but I think the downward spiral really began in 2015, when I began having intrusive thoughts, specifically incestuous ones about my own family. Since then everything's pretty much turned to shit. I was prescribed SSRI's just so I could function on a daily basis. They were helpful for a time but before too long they turned me into an emotionless, uncaring zombie who treated people like shit.

However it wasn't only the SSRI's that made me treat the people around me like shit. That just made it easier since it was easier to not fear the consequences. But what really made me do it was the fact that I was so tired of worrying what people thought of me and trying to impress them that I just said fuck it. I began to insult people while masquerading it as edgy jokes whereas really I just thrived of the attention I got. 

I've never really been able to connect with people. Not really. I've never had a best friend. Only minor acquaintances and people I third wheel with. So I feel like I've never really developed a personality. I don't know. I probably need a therapist. Like a really good one. 

I don't think I'm a good person to be honest. I'm not sure I deserve to be happy. I think I'm a fake, cowardly weasel with no integrity. I'm a fucking worthless maggot. I really hate who I am. 

It really seems impossible to write down all my problems in a single reddit post. Every time I write something down I think of something else that's terrible about me to add. 

I'm still trying kind of but I feel I may be too far gone.",24Jun2017,1
3,"A few years ago I was depressed and had a very hard time on the day to day, always overanalyzing and in pain and just Bad. This stopped about two or three years ago, and since then I returned to being the bubbly happy person I was, and have found lots of success in most areas of my life. This past year especially has been amazing for me: everything has basically begun falling into place exactly as I hoped.

Usually I keep myself pretty occupied but the past two days there was nothing to do besides read (and I can only do that for so long before I need time to ingest what I read), and have become tired and anxious and sad a few hours into the day. Is this a bad sign regarding some sort of return to what I was? Or just what happens when you lounge around with nothing to do for too long?",24Jun2017,1
4,"So, I often catch myself talking to people in my head. They are not imaginary friends, but my real friends, with their real personalities and habits, to the point that I can almost(or sometimes literally) hear their voices. The conversations I'm having could pretty much happen in real life, but they always(when I catch myself having those conversations) evolve to me telling people about sometimes talking to them in my head, which I probably would never say if it was in real life.
So my question is: Is it normal, or am I going crazy?",24Jun2017,7
5,"I'm tired so, long short... Yes it's genetic...

30 years of depression, increasing suicidal thoughts to rock bottom led to the decision to seek medication.

Antidepressants revealed BiPolar 2.

Lamictal 200mg lifted depression and stabilized mood. Titrated over 1yr.

Adderall defeated the fog, mostly.

Have OCD, Dermatillomania,

Avoidant personality. Dissociation...

Occasionaly Hear inaudible voices/sounds, smell things that aren't there, see shapes in the dark, feel paranoia.


Always been ""weird"" and made coworkers uncomfortable or afraid for whatever reason... not sure. I'm just quiet most of the time. Lost jobs for it. I'm not violent but, aware of being a poor verbal communicator.

Started retail job last year, witnessed theft ring on a large scale operation. It is real... News stories confirm. Most employees pretended it wasn't happening or advised me to ignore it. When I didn't, I began receiving vague threats from customers, advice to leave, referred to as ""squeaky"" by an employee and customer. Was followed home at least once...

That led me into deep paranoid psychosis... supposedly. I didn't go to work. I wanted to run away. Thought I was going to be hurt or killed. I contacted Police, FBI, Corporate and Lawyers when. Thought people were following me. Recorded everything. Pissed myself... 

I'm not sure how much of this I am extrapolating in my mind. I am aware of the fear this year, how irrational it was. I ended up getting EAP, taking leave and diagnosing myself as Bipolar 1 instead of the former Bipolar 2. Now, I talk myself down from running into full blown psychosis but, between the hard verbal confirmations, denials and actions of staff, I'm not sure what is real or not.

It's been exactly a year and, I've been in 3 stores. The 2nd store had Lighter shoplifting than 1st and 3rd.

I don't do the same job so, It's easier to ignore but, everyone started talking about it due to the hard hit this week. Yesterday, another employee pointed out a shoplifter, was told to ignore it. ""Don't ask questions you don't want to know the answer to."" She insisted. I saw 5 Male employees come together to get the man and escort him out of the store. Thought it was funny because there were 20+ shoplifters in this day... as often happens in a massive, traveling theft ring.

Have been discussing with other employees who are finding a lot of stashed items and empty packaging.  I asked  TWO of the employees who escorted the man out and they acted like it didn't happen. I never saw the employee who reported the shoplifter again but, she could have gotten off shift...

I realized it is probably psychosis when I noticed the furniture breathing, which told me I am hallucinating a bit but, I find it hard to believe that I've gone full blown ""beautiful mind"" and am imagining actual people in full detail...

I hate having to doubt my reality. Of course I don't want to believe I'm making this up. Before last year, I don't think I've ever experienced something this bad. I've had minor paranoia and hallucination for many years but, never anything so impactful. Yes, it may be progressing.

Of course it bothers me that it's happening again. It's possible some things are being denied to avoid hysteria in the store. I know how ""rangering"" works. Withold information to keep everything ""happy.""

What get's me is the simultaneous confirm and deny from different people. I'm not sure if I'm hearing and seeing things this intense...

This job has destroyed any sense of sanity I had. I have no idea who I am. I feel like I don't remember anything right. 

I guess I don't need to say how it feels. I'm sure some of you know...



edit: I do get along with a lot of people but, they do a lot of shit talking. Have confirmed with other employees.

It's been easier in retail world, due to havign 200ish employees in a store with sparse contact. I'm not always quiet. I do get somewhat manic but, it's rare.

7,"Hi, first post here, ill get right to it. I am looking for some help in finding good sources for a psychologist when you don't have insurance or a whole lot of cash to spend out of pocket. Also, if psychotherapy would be a good idea as a course of action for my specific issues.

I was hospitalized for a few months or so when I was 17/18 due to mental health issues. While I was in the mental hospital they diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder and schizoid personality disorder. I am 30 now. With only one other very short 48 hour hold when I was 25. When I got out of the hospital on my 2nd stint, they put me on Depakote and Risperdal. The medication didn't sit well with me. They took me down deeper into depression. So I stopped taking the medication and moved on. I self mutilated a little until about 22 and then stopped. Anyways, I lived with my aunt and uncle shortly after getting out of the hospital, they considered my a fairly bright guy. They would consistently talk about how I had nothing wrong with me mentally and that I was just messing with the doctors to get a reaction. To a degree at that age, I probably did a little bit. My father followed with their train of though and would say the same thing, never really taking the idea that I may have some mental issues seriously. I eventually fell into the same line to a degree and considered myself just a little eccentric.

Fast forward through my twenties and I have a very hard time holding down a job (and early relationships). My desires and aspirations change on a bi weekly basis. I will go full swing into studying or working in a certain field and then just lose all interest and move on to something completely different. I have certain things circulate around such as computers, construction, art, taxidermy. A large portion of my perspective changes as I switch gravitation back and forth between these different things and when I am doing something that I have lost interest in its like my world bleeds out. I get super depressed quick, irritable, hateful, and just generally misanthropic. When I swing back towards something new I come alive again. But I daydream about the end result right off the bat and become too excited and not realistic. I burn all my own ideas to the ground. It makes it impossible to do something and be happy. So instead I sink my time into nothing as I get older. I just give up on the notion of it all for the most part and just end up simply existing - while still having these burst of drive that get further and further apart. 

I can see the anxiety/depression when it comes and understand it is irrational, yet I can't stop the giant ball of shitty energy that just circulated and builds in me. I don't enjoy it. It doesn't help that all my interests in terms of music, art, authors, ect are also all very dark for the most part. I can't enjoy much else because it all seems like bullshit. I have a lot of suicidal daydreams, however they are mostly seen from my angle as a choice that becomes more prominent as I age and don't have anything to show for it. At times it just seems like that it is the only logical way for things to progress. Not a cry for help, or a fuck you to anyone, just a natural progression for the road I cant seem to get off. I can't keep a decision for longer than 3 weeks to a month so this comes and goes also, just like everything else.

I am not out on the street. I am okay, I have people that love me and I have time...yet all that doesn't seem to help me fix the issue. If anything having people in my life makes me feel worse. At times I feel like them helping me out is viewed as me being manipulative by friends or other family members. Mainly my girlfriend supports us and loves me despite the income I bring in. And she is the one thing that I love in life. Which makes our relationship hard because I feel like its unfair to be with here when she could be with somebody that makes more money and can help her achieve everything she wants in life. Money matters and with me, I feel like weight because I can't get it steadily. I work 2-3 days doing construction with family every other week or so. So if anything I bring in like 600-1000 bucks a month. It crushes me that I cant keep myself in a position to provide the things she does in life. Others view me as a leech and friends crack jokes when I do decide to force myself to go out every now and then. It drives me down. Then I get paranoid and assume everyone has these super negative views of me and that i'm just lazy. And that is how I viewed myself. Just too lazy to buckle down and handle my business flat out. And everything else is just a scapegoat.

Well, I was talking to my girlfriend a few days ago and going over some of my diagnosis from that time when I was 18. She has noticed me kinda getting in a dark head space again, but she also noticed she can see me getting super anxious trying to actively stop myself from going there. It makes sense that a well educated doctor in the field can read how you're responding to them. So, maybe my diagnosis were never off the mark, maybe the doctors got it right and my family didn't want to accept it...so eventually neither did I. I moved past it never really helping myself get better and now it might be a good idea to get a psychologist and some help. Maybe I am facing real hurdles that I need help or the proper tools to get over. I don't know. But I do know I don't want to make bad decision and constantly struggle in a fight of loving and hating myself and everyone else if I don't need to.

I just need a little bit of help in finding out a good option.

15,"When my father was sick. He asked me to go underneath the house in the rain and make sure the duct system had not come undone in the living room. I refused to go as I could tell it was working right. But he was stubborn and went himself. Caught Pneumonia and died a few weeks later. 

My best friend who I thought of as a brother passed away while hiking with his family. I was supposed to wake up that morning and go do some work on the shed with him. Instead I stayed up late and overslept. So instead of working with me he went on the hike and fell.

I currently lift weights, do high intensity running (hill sprints) and slow long distance runs atm and I think that the slower, longer runs (say 3 miles to 7 miles dependant on ability) seem to have been the most beneficial.

21,"Someone close to me admitted they have a problem and opened up to me about it. Unfortunately I have absolutely no idea how to handle it. Please can someone help me? Let me summarise.

(1) To begin with this person has a pretty great life and nothing that could cause specific unhappiness, except for a sister with behavioural disorder who regularly argues or tears her room apart. Note the person is moving out of where her sister lives soon

(2) The problems seem to be due to thoughts that can't be stopped that she says ""consume"" her

(3) she feels embarassed and doesn't feel anyone will understand these issues

(4) feels that friends and family do not like her or love her and sees no good in herself. Note this person is well-loved by absolutely everyone, more so than anyone I know.

(5) feels anxious about being able to make new friends and fit in when moving house in new area/job

(6) actively tried to make people like her by making excessive effort with people. now says she stopped as no one ever did the same back. since I have known her she always makes more effort (i.e. making sure someone is ok, making friends, being there for them) with people than anyone I know. The obvious result is that she will never get the same back as it's not within most people's capacity.

(7) felt that she was owed help by friends/family for her wedding, felt let down when none was given. This is despite everyone offers to help her but she never accepts. In reality it is wrong to expect help and be disappointed when no help is received. Instead help should be viewed as a bonus if given

(8) Feels anxious and uncomfortable when going out with people, i.e. social situations. Has now started going out much less and ignored calls/pretended to be busy in order to avoid these situations. A definite drinking problem where she would drink before a social situation to ease the issue - the severity of this is not clear as she has not admitted this to any great extent. I noticed that majority of the time I saw her she was notably drunk but denied drinking. She has said that she will not drink at all now and that if I think she has I should report it to her family. Also she does not like to drink but only does it to ease anxiety in social situation

(9) feels like a failure despite having two degrees and being successful in her profession

(10) think shes ugly despite being genuine 10/10

(11) spends the night worrying about issues like will anyone miss her when she moves or do her friends care about her - many sleepless nights spent worrying

This person is genuinely crumbling to pieces over issues that don't even exist. It's like if I had $100 million in the bank and spent sleepless nights worrying about how I would afford to eat the next day (obviously I have never said anything like this to her). How do I help this person?

25,"So to start of I have depression anxiety ptsd and asd and my ex partner had depression
So its a long story. My partner and I were together for roughly seven months. Both him and I are mentally ill. During our relationship near the start he had a breakdown. Because of this I got him counselling set up safe words (he wasn't good at expressing himself so we set up an easy number system) created a safe environment for him, and other things that would go to in depth to his situation to bring up. 
In the last month my mental health has been on the decline rather rapidly. All though he did give me some emotional support I felt like he didn't do that much. One thing about me is that I was also in an abusive relationship so , not only are relationships hard but so is everyday life with mental illnesses.  Expresing mself and being rational sometimes was hard and I understand that is ifficultto be with. 
(trigger warning suicide You can carry onto the next paragraph if youd like)Yesterday I took a lot of medication to have an overdose. I dont really know what the solid reason is it was partially to kill myself and partially because I just needed a release and thats all i could think I could do. 
So I was in  a bad state and ended up in hospital. The closest one to me is a while away So I went in the ambulance while my family was at home making sure my younger siblings where okay. My at the time boyfriend came to visit so I wasnt alone until my family came.  we were in a rough patch but the last time I saw him thins ended well.  He made the situation very much about himself. He went back and forth between telling me that he did or didnt love me and he told me I was selfish and how I didnt think of him. He did look after me He got me water and sick bowls called the doctor or nurse when I needed them and he held my hand. I understood at the very begining I need to give myself some time to heal so A couple weeks break might be good. Thts even what he has told my mother. 
However since then he has kept changing his mind or saying hes uncertain if we should be together and if I want him back Ill have to prove it. I told him I would drop his clothes into college. Bu he said he is coming around my house to say goodbye to my sibblings. And then goes to quiz me on if I want to get bck with him. He tells me I need to work on myself but when I prioritise myself he says I need to think about our relationship. I'm a bit stuck.

When I stopped taking it I felt mostly normal, I've had this building feeling of being dumb and worthless since the beginning of June so I figured that was unrelated to the meds, but it manifested into somewhat of an episode last night.

We are nearing the end, yet many people are still spiritually sleeping, unaware of Bible prophecy unfolding before our very eyes. 
Consumed by the false reality of everything being okay and the world heading in a positive direction. This is all setup by the devil. 
Chaos abounds and the world is becoming more corrupt day by day. What will it take for you to realize the times, that we are living
 in the end times spoken of in Bible prophecy. I ask you today to turn from your sins, to repent of them, and to turn to Jesus Christ
 and follow Him, to learn His teachings and do them. God does not want to lose any souls, but if you love this world, this life, the
 wickedness of this world, God will let you have it. If you don't care for the truth, that you might be saved, then you wont be. 
Don't you want to know where you are going to end up after this life? I know I did and I researched and studied until God showed me
 the truth. And the truth is Jesus Christ. He died for your sins and wants you to come to Him and learn what He wants from you so
 you can be reconciled back to God from your sins. You don't need to go to Church, because they are full of false teachers in these
 end times. What you need to do is buy a King James Version Bible and read it for yourself and realize that every word in it is %100
 truth and the inspired words of God. I hope and pray you turn to God while there is still time as many end time wars are looming 
and things are going to change drastically in the coming years. According to prophecies we have 10-20 years before Jesus returns.
 Will you be ready?

43,"So I'm a 16 year old guy from England and I have this disease which gives me really thin hair, 9 teeth, red skin around the eyes etc etc. Basically I look like the definition of ugly. Ever since I can remember, people have been calling me names, but there is one name that has always pissed me so ch I can't stop myself from trying to hurt whoever said it - I think this is what people call a ""trigger"" word. I can barely type it because it pains me to think about, but they call me Gollum. And I can see Why, whenever I look in the mirror that's what I see. (Bear in mind I've never been in a fight or anything other than these occasions)

Anyways, since I always feel god awful and have absolutely no chance with any girls ever (I have no societal issues so I am able to ask them out but just get rejected) I was wondering if I should seek medication for depression or something. At the moment im complementing moving to Amsterdam for euthanasia as soon as I can afford it but I don't want to upset my parents. Would medication help me feel better? Would it stop me from trying to hurt people when they say the word? Thanks for your time

Edit: i really didn't expect so many replies, thank you all so much for your support, it genuinely made me feel much better! I'll take all your advice on board, just because i didn't reply doesn't mean i didn't read and appreciate it. Thank you all so very much again.",24Jun2017,16
44,"Long story short, I have Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and I've struggled with eating disorders in the past which is now starting to resurface. I've not been doing well since I came home from university last month, my home life isn't great and I've felt awful ever since I came back. There are environmental factors that I know contribute to my mental health getting bad again but I can't do anything about that until I go back to university in a couple of months. I think I'm mostly wondering if anyone here has any advice on coping with mental illness when they're trying to make the best of a bad situation? There isn't really a point in me going to a doctor because whatever they try to do for me will have me on a waiting list (I'm from the UK and unfortunately the NHS is like that) long after I've gone back to university.

I'm really struggling right now.",24Jun2017,2
