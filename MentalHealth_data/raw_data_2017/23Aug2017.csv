2,"**TL;DR: Self perspective killing my ability to be happy with myself and others. Always alone and have been trying to be normal for years. What can I do?**

I'll try to keep this as short as I can. I'm 21, male in Western Canada. I have a degree and a pretty great full time job (In terms of pay but low in personal satisfaction and future potential), I take care of myself, completely independant (Solo renting/own a vehicle) and have no family or friends (Besides distant facebook friends) here at all. I have moved from one small town to the next about every two years. 

I am generally caring and I have a lot of interests (Especially outdoors/geography). However I can hardly meet people due to time/availability and means to do so. As well, if I do meet people, I can never form a connection because A. I am very weird. B. I am overloaded with shame and self hatred and no self confidence or respect.

I have been battling my inner treatment of myself for nearly a decade now and I'm SO much better than before (I used to have no job or school and was a self harming suicidal borderline alcoholic) but I'm still very unsatisfied with myself every day. I think I am the worst in almost every way possible and often have periods of time that last hours but feel like days where I am paralyzed by self hatred and the world feels like it's ending.

I have jumped through 3-4 therapists over the years trying to find a solution. They were helpful but too expensive and too infrequent and I could never fully get rid of my disease of my inner dialogue and world view.

Today I went to the doctor for the first time in years. I really liked him but he pretty much told me that I'm a fine healthy guy and I just need to get out and socialize. And it's not like he didn't listen to me, he was a good investigative doctor but that was his conclusion.

But I can't socialize when I feel the way I do about myself and I'm so fucking weird. I think I may be destined to be a lonely hermit my whole life. I don't know if I'll ever know a loving connection with others or myself.

I don't know what to do, any advice would be appreciated. Already I want to pack up and move somewhere else far away where no one knows me at all and I don't need to be worried all the time.

The ideal friend to me is someone who loves to go outside like camping/fishing etc and is curious about world geography/history etc. I live in nowhere and I've tried meetups, online dating, local volunteering and more to meet people.

Any advice is greatly appreciated thanks!",23Aug2017,2

Every thing went really well and I had a brilliant case. There is even a good chance I am going to win this thing. 

My problem is however that I cannot seem to get the whole thing out of my mind. It's 3:00am where I am right now and I still haven't slept and I feel an enormous amount of anxiety and a knot in my stomach...I am really struggling to get over what happened in court and what has been happening in my life for the past few months

6,"Here is the whole deal. I left public school because of mental and physical health problems and my parents spent a lot of money enrolling me in an online school that I was really excited to start. A month in my school work stopped. I just, stopped. I haven't had any motivation to do it since May. I sit down with it in front of me and get nothing done. My depression which I've had for a couple years periodically gets worse to the point I won't leave bed. I won't eat, shower, all that. The last time I was like this, my mother came in and told me that I was an 8 year, talked about how I don't do anything and about how I'm going to live at home wasting her money. (she doesn't have a job, mind you) I guess that really hit me hard and after that I was in a state where I was the most suicidal I had ever been. I made a plan, thought about how I would do. A few days later, I had my wisdom teeth removed and for about 2 weeks after that my mood had greatly improved, perhaps it was the insane amount of drugs I was on, or because my mom was really supportive. However, thats over now. My depression is back and my mom is also extremely depressed. She is depressed because of me, because I'm slowly ruining her life. She still talks about college because she always imagined me having an education and a good job, but I'm in a state where I want to commit suicide to make it easier for her. Because i'm the problem.
I never have energy or motivation, I get in short spurts where i'm really entertained by a game, maybe a few days sometimes a week, and I'm bored of it again. I don't eat actual food, I don't exercise, I don't leave my room. Im sure everyone will say you just listed your problems, do those things and everything will fix itself. I can't do those things without motivation. I can't do anything. I feel like i'm losing it being expected to now take care of my mom while she's in this state but I can't take care of myself. 
I notice now, as I'm writing this, that I never say that I will commit suicide. I say want, but not will. But whenever I talked about it, I realize that will is there. Since the 5th grade I told myself I wasn't going to live past 18. I always said none of it was worth it. Part of me still believes that. The other part of me just wants to find a working husband and be a housewife, because I am more than happy with being a housewife because hell, its something.

8,"I'll try and make this one quick. I just needed to put this somewhere. I'm a male, 30ish, with genetic links to clinical depression and possible borderline personality disorder - both of which I believe I have mild to moderate versions of.

This last weekend I decided on the spur of the moment to smoke some weed. It's something I've only done a couple of times before, and I know from those previous times that it has negatively impacted my mental heath a couple of days later. It tends to lead to a feeling of the world not quite being real, or being unable to process it properly. It leaves me feeling a bit like if this is what it's like to go insane. Generally it takes several days to happen, and only lasts for a day or so. So I wasn't too worried. I felt relaxed and in a good place and just like it wouldn't be an issue.

It was ok for the first day afterwards. But since then (4 days later), I've been having those same feelings non-stop and amped up. It's difficult to think straight. If I focus on something it's ok, but without a focus point the world feels unreal. I feel like I'm not fully in control of my thoughts, and worse, my actions - even though I haven't done anything out of the ordinary yet, I'm afraid I might. When I'm home, the silence in my apartment is disturbing me, despite having lived with that for years (and indeed, appreciating the excellent soundproofing). I feel constantly on edge - not afraid of anything in particular, just like I need to be ready for anything.

I should add I'm currently suffering from a worsening flu, and not sure how much that is contributing to my sense of derealisation. But that just makes it more likely I'll have to go home from work, sick, and I'm concerned about being in that silent place and what I might do on impulse. I'm hopeful that if I can hold this off for a bit (and get better), it'll go away just like it has previously. But I'm also concerned I may have broken my mind permanently, one of those marijuana-triggered psychoses the media loves to report on. Anyone have any reassuring words or advice I could use to help get through this?",23Aug2017,1
9,"Hi there. For the past five years, I've struggled with several mental illnesses (including OCD, anxiety, depression, an eating disorder, yada yada). During that time, I've done three IOPs, a PHP, been hospitalized four times, and been in a residential program for a month. And I've been in therapy/on meds for the entire time. I feel like I've tried just about everything. Things get better, but then they get worse again. And things are really bad right now. It's affecting (effecting?) my day to day life so intensely, and I'm starting to become hopeless. My question is - what other treatment is out there?

I dont know what it is. I'm 21 and have noticed this all my life. My mom has to always either be the center off attention by my achievements or have a pity party. I cant talk to her about anything, never have been, cause she'll turn the conversation into something about herself.",23Aug2017,11

14,"So i have had lifelong depression and anxiety. History of childhood abuse and bullying etc.

im 33 now and in a way better place mentally than ever before. But i just cant seem to ever feel proud of anything i accomplish orfeel good when i get compliments.

I dont feel depressed , a little anxious lately but thats all. 

I got the best evaluation at my job i have ever got. And my boss actually appologised for being a butthole to me which was equivalent to like finding a unicorn that poops gold coins. And they are happy with my work....

How did i feel after the eval? Nothing ...but a tiny bit relieved that i dont have to worry about getting fired...atleast right now.

My friend at work told me how proud she was of me. Making goals and achieving them. She told me i should be proud of myself. But no matter what i achieve i never feel proud of what i do.

I also feel nothing when i recieve compliments. From family or my friend. This i think goes back to the childhood abuse. Where the abusers would for example..buy me something . Could be anything from medicine to a cheap toy. After i accepted the item they would then lord it over me for a week. Anytime they saw me use the item they would walk up and say ""your welcome! Dont forget im the one that bought that for you!"" 

So that in itself ruined all giftgiving occasions for me since i dont feel anything then either but awkward because im expected to have a positive emotional response but im just plain faced like ""thankyou "", im sure it makes me seem ungrateful. But thats not the case. I just dont know how to recieve a gift and feel anything . 

my mind instantly upon recieving the gift thinks that the only reason i got it was , A:because they want something in return. , or B: they only gave it to me because its whats socially expected during whatever occasion it may bea and they dont want to look bad . Or C:they want something to hold over me. 
 
Now i know that this isnt the case. But knowing that stuff isnt true doesnt change how i feel about it.

When i recieve a compliment it just rolls off me like water off a ducks back. Like it never happened. I nod or thank them or give a smile to make them happy and not seem like a jerk. But in the back of my head is like....whats your angle? What do you really want?

Iam so tired of feeling that way. I want to feel whatever its like to feel proud of myself. Or to feel good when someone compliments me...but i cant ever remember that feeling if ive ever felt it i cant say. 

Ive come so far with my depression and anxiety to have my happiness muted or taken away sucks.

 How do i feel positive things when people are nice to me? I really dont know .",23Aug2017,2
15,"I have recently come to understand that I think I have Social anxiety. I've spent the last 6 months trying to bring myself to call my GP and make an appointment to talk to someone but I find this very difficult to do. I have previously been for other issues and every time that I have been they have been very dismissive of any issues that I have had and I've always left wanting to cry and feeling like I've wasted their time. Now this has become a huge barrier to me feeling able to talk to anyone about this. I haven't been able to talk to anyone about how I feel. My parents are not the kindest of people and I know that they won't think that anything is wrong. But today for example, I had to leave a shop because the sales assistant said hello and asked if I needed anything and I just couldn't cope with it. I've always been unable to talk to strangers, it just feels like I can't function when a stranger tries to talk to me. I know that that can't be a normal thing, but I just don't think that anyone would understand. I just wanted to know if anyone living in the UK knows of a way that I can get help without talking to my GP.

She just told me ""plenty of people live with hallucinations of all kinds, and still lead a normal life."" Well congrats to them, but that's not how my brain works. I'm scared. I know the voices can't hurt me, but they can make me hurt myself. The images that show up in my head aren't pleasing. Feeling like someone is constantly watching me makes me nervous. 
Just because I can still tell the difference between what is real, and what are hallucinations, does that mean it doesn't matter what happens to me? Does that mean I don't need help?

I've been having problems with social interaction lately, because i am always insecure and self-conscious. I have a close friend which i spend time everyday together, but i cannot feel that close because of my paranoia is blocking me to show my true feelings. And apparently according to then i am very paranoid. 

To be honest i know i am, but i am paranoid / scared / anxious of losing my friend(s), which is pretty close, that they wont be happy if i am not that bubbly or cheerful in daily, so i try my best to act happy. But sometimes i just lose it and snap at them. And at times like this i often say sorry afterwards of guilty, and scared they wont friend me anymore. I often ask if they have anything against me or are not happy about something, and they noticed it and said to be less paranoid (which i cannot possibly just STOP being it), they are not happy that im being paranoid. But i really enjoy this particular friend circle. 

Some would say i am paranoid of losing friends because last time during school, i dont really have friends (close one), and now i try to friend everyone. 

I dont know what should i do cause now i am also paranoid of being paranoid since it means i can lose my friend that are not happy of me being paranoid. I try to lie to myself not to give it a F, but in the end i know i would be lying if i dont.

Hi there, 

My name is Bella Vasoya and I am a fourth-year student in the Psy.D. program at Pacific University in Hillsboro Oregon. I am currently looking for Asian Indian individuals over the age of 18 who have been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes to participate in a dissertation study exploring the effects of health messaging on the delivery of culturally appropriate food suggestions for patients with Type 2 Diabetes.

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the frequency and type of nutritional recommendations and information patients with type 2 diabetes receive from healthcare professionals. A secondary but important question is whether this information is based on the standard American diet or conveys cultural sensitivity and competence. A third goal for this project is to identify what type of health messaging would be effective as a general strategy for increasing cultural awareness and competency, and whether culturally tailored messages will increase patients’ willingness to make changes in diet and nutrition.

Participation will take place via an online survey (link provided below) and will take no longer than one hour to complete. Your participation will involve exposure to a health message and responding to questionnaires. All data related to your participation will be kept anonymous. 

This study is under the direction of Dr. Jennifer Antick and has been approved by the Pacific University IRB. 

Click to participate: https://pacificu.co1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_9TwFSKrTWUqV3r7

Please feel free to pass the information and link onto others who meet criteria for participation. Thank you!

40,"Here's a heap of symptoms:

* Difficulty focusing
* Tired, even with 7-9 hours of sleep (and daily wind down, blackout shades, sleep mask)
* Alternation between high self esteem and low self esteem, in the same week or day
* Alternation between feeling fully happy and feeling so bad about myself that I think about death, in the same week or day
* I cry a lot

I have a history of anxiety and panic attacks. I'm taking CBD, which helps a *lot*, but I'm not sure if there's still some anxiety leftover.

These symptoms have been going on, with varying intensity, for years, I think.

One psych dismissed me as not having ADHD when I asked if that could be causing my focus issues. And he said my issues were just due to my ""temperament"", not delving into the majority of my symptoms.

Another psych prescribed me Seroquel for sleep, but its Wikipedia page repeats that it should not be used for sleep. So I'm not sure I trust it enough to try it. After this, she wanted to consider a mood stabilizer.

42,"So I'm a 30 year-old female living in the U.S, and I'm basically a loner. I can't decide if I'm happy with that or not. I was in a relationship for 11 1/2 years, engaged for 2 and it ended early 2016. I prefer being alone most of the time, but I do occasionally feel lonely and isolated. I'm pretty much always tired, depressed, and anxious. I was on Lexapro for about a year and a half and recently switched to Trintellix. I actually felt like a normal person for a period of time last year. I felt positive, and I was pretty social. My interactions with people were much ""smoother"" than they had been previously, but eventually things started to deteriorate and I have retired back into my dark little hole.

 I have one friend who invites me out now and then and it's usually to bars which I don't like at all, but I usually give in out of desperation. Though, the last few times she's invited me out I have declined. I've also turned down a guy I really like. In regards to this guy, I feel like I'm not good enough and it drives me crazy. He's nice, normal, attractive, and I just feel like a total weirdo in comparison.

I wish I could stop being so down on myself and just go with the flow, but I feel so stuck in my head and underdeveloped as a person. 

I could probably go into greater detail about the events that happened in my life and the relationship I was in, but I guess those things don't matter as much the way I've let them affect me.

46,"Hello all... this is a throwaway I made up specifically for this issue.  I've been a Redditor for years and unfortunately there's likely too much on my own account to identify me.

Current mental illnesses:  Depression, anxiety, intrusive thoughts, selective mute, concentration problems, Trichotillomania, low self esteem, racing thoughts, death phobia, and others.

I live in the US, currently working for a non-profit organization.  A lot of things about my job are good, and enjoyable, but there are things that have weighed me down in the past few years.  I started seeing a therapist in February of 2016.  Started Cymbalta in June of 2016.

They have both helped to varying degrees, however many of my issues stem from a history of issues and are not just work related. Also, as many of you may know, it can still be a constant level to keep yourself 'afloat'.

I think my mental illness has affected me at this current job basically since I got here, but only over the last 3-4 months has it been visible to others.  Not that they see the mental illness, due to me using all y strength to keep it in check, but they see the eff-ups I do, and the questionable decisions I've made.

What makes the pressure on me so difficult, is that I'm in a rather high standing position in the company, in Human Resources, and roughly 4th-5th from the 'top'. 

Well, the 'top' has seem my mistakes, as well as others, and I've been having increasingly more and more difficult conversations with my boss.  For the first time, about 2 weeks ago, I was told my performance could ""potentially lead to jeopardizing my employment"".  Obviously, this only made my mental state worse.

Two days ago, I was in late due to a bad reaction to a medication I'm taking for another illness.  The medication is Humira and can have some difficult side effects, such as extreme exhaustion, and for me, a 'brain fog', as I call it.  I told my boss I wasn't feeling well as I came in and we sat down for a meeting and he called the meeting off immediately stating that if I'm not 100% then we shouldn't be meeting.  Sternly told me to apply for FMLA. And then an hour later scolded me for replying to an all office email from another coworker regarding the eclipse stating 'if you don't have time to meet then you shouldn't have time for that'... or something to that effect.

Most of my time working here, my boss has been great.  In fact, the greatest boss I've had.  Yet these last few interactions have left me feeling like I'm alone here, and can't open up about anything.

I'm just curious as to what others have done to protect themselves and their jobs while battling their mental illness, and how you would go about telling, or not telling your immediate supervisor about your mental and physical issues that you are dealing with.  Right now, I'm retreating into my own head and so afraid of saying anything.

It felt like hell, but at the same time it didn't feel real. I didn't feel real and I wondered if I would ever feel normal again. I was nauseous and my heart was racing so I was able to identify it as a panic attack but honestly this is the worst kind of panic because it literally came out of nowhere. One minute I was eating some lemon pie and watching Rick and Morty and the next minute I felt as if I was slipping from reality. This feeling passed in less than 10 min and ended with me trying to distract myself by watching a Youtube video of people experiencing the solar eclipse and I started crying? Lol yeah so I was definitely overly emotional. I see a therapist once a week and am on Celexa and Remeron which help but gah it was such a scary feeling.

I havent really been feeling well for the past year or two. I dont know how to put this, but I have a lot of things I want/have to do right now. School just started and over the summer Ive tried to exercise as much as possible, partly for myself but mostly for an assignment in school. Our teacher wanted us to make a training plan and then follow it for eight weeks. This was before the summer break and I still havent done it because of me cutting myself and my teacher telling me that I could do it later if I wanted to. Since then Ive run three times. I have barely played any piano either despite me promising myself before the summer that I would try to play as much as possible because I really want to learn the song Im working on right now. Ive played around five times. I always say to myself that I will change myself and that tomorrow will be the day when I do all these things I need to do and the things Ive dreamed about doing, but I just cant get myself to do it, and I hate myself for it. 

I have nobody that I feel like I can talk to. I dont like the idea of talking to my parents because they would get really worried about me, and Im not keen on going back to the school nurse either after what has happened. I have some friends but Id rather keep them out of this, I really have no idea how they would react about me cutting myself so when someone in school says anything about why Im not talking much or why I dont want to do something Ill just say that Im tired.

Sorry for the wall of text but typing all this made me feel a bit better.",23Aug2017,2
49,I did therapy for two months till my insurance ran out and my last session i said I had no idea coming in I had social anxiety but it makes sense. Then she said she's not a doctor she can't diognose me but she's the one who said I had anixiety. I want to go to therapy again and get a mental health assessment but who do I go to? ,23Aug2017,1
51,"So i am currently in the psych ward (for the 10000th time it feels like) for day 3. 
I was first in a ward called 90. Which i usually am and where i feel safe. They transported me to another ward in a different town called 60. 
I really dont like it here and all i do is lay in bed feeling miserable. My ex girlfriend is here too. But she ignores me eventho she was so happy that i came to the ward she was in.  I barely talk to my roommate because shes too depressed. 
I dont make any progress. I dont want to go back ""home"" which is a psychiatric rehab place. But i dont want to stay here either. Idk if i want to die but i dont feel like i want to exist. Ive told the psych that i am going to stop taking medication and idk if she agreed or not. 
This post didnt rlly make much purpose but i was wondering if anyone has kik or something that i can talk to? That might be or has been in the same situation? I know there is a kikpals reddit but all i get there are pervs. 
Thanks for reading. ",23Aug2017,1
54,"I'm not sure how many of you are familiar with the term ""raid"" when online. Generally a group of trolls will organize behind a cause of some kind, usually to bully or dox someone. Which is shitty. 

But I was wondering if a group could organize for a positive cause of blasting a bunch of positive and uplifting messages to someone who needs it. 
Inspirational or inspiring messages to people suffering eating disorders, anxiety or depressive disorders, bipolar, borderline personality, antisocial personality, chronic pain patients, suicidal people, teens who are afraid to speak up about their illnesses... wondering if this was a thing. 

Maybe it could be a private subreddit of some kind to organize targeting an in-need account. 

I've seen stuff like this when it came to a man dancing alone or a kid who didn't have anyone RSVP to his party have like 800 people show up because of the interwebs magic. 

I just wanted to maybe make someone's day better or give them a push to recovery. 

Sorry if this is the wrong place for this! ",23Aug2017,1

Couple of years ago I was very unhappy, sometimes suicidal and would take it out on my parents, i'd be aggressive and try to make them feel bad. Recently, I have been feeling lost in my mind. I can't figure out if i'm happy or not, I feel very empty and alone. At the same time i'm pretty sure i am not overly unhappy. Last year I dropped out of college and I still don't know why, just one day I stopped going. It was a great course and i'd be doing good now if I had stayed. Last week I stopped turning up at work, it was a decent job as well and now I have no chance of returning back as I've left all my bosses calls unanswered. I can't seem to feel emotions recently, its been about a month now, although before I was pretty unhappy i had peaks in my mood feeling intense happiness. I would spend most the day feeling down but exited waiting for those peaks. Now i'm not sure what i'll do. I've tried being positive for years now, I managed to stop 4 years of self harm last year but since then i've just felt worse. I did it using psychedelics if that means anything. Sorry this is so negative, i feel like an idiot posting this online so i'm using a new acc. I don't know if I should go to the doctors about this, or should I just man up and deal with it? I wouldn't want my family to know. I am sorry if this is just me whining about my average life. i'll probably look to see if there are any comments (if any) sorry if I don't reply though

Sorry if this seems stupid, hopefully it makes sense to post here i can't tell my mind is such a mess ",23Aug2017,2
56,"Hi all, 

I was prescribed Sertraline at the age of 14 and I am now 20. Although, I've never been consistent with them and always end up dropping them. I was wondering how effective it is for treating OCD, specifically obsessive and intrusive thoughts, as well as the anxiety it brings about. I also have strong social anxiety too, so I would like to know how this has helped any of you who are suffering from the same issues. As I mentioned, I've tried SSRIs before but I abruptly stopped, causing me to become extremely agitated and snappy at people for no reason. My OCD is fairly hard to live with as I have to inspect each and every one of my belongings for scratches, internal damage, and imperfections. This ruins my whole day as I am very obsessive about my belongings being in perfect condition. I also obsess over hygiene and germs too which makes it very awkward in social situations (when I have to shake somebody's hand for example).

If any of you have seen a decrease in intrusive thoughts and obssesive habits, I'd love to read about it. I figured now is the best time for me to consistently take my meds, as my anxiety makes it extremely difficult for me to focus (to the point where I lost my job, unfortunately.) And I'd really like to be able to relax again.

Thanks a lot :)",23Aug2017,1
57,"Hi everyone. So I've dealt with anxiety for a long time, and I've seen counselors before off and on, but I'm thinking about going back. But I'm not sure what type of specialist to see. 

I know psychiatrists can prescribe meds, but I've tried anti-anxiety meds before through my general practitioner, and it really didn't work. Does this suggest I should go to someone who is more focused on the therapy side? I guess I'd still be open to meds along with therapy, but I don't want someone to just give me zoloft or something and call it good. 

Any advice is appreciated.",23Aug2017,1

61,"  I hate my self-criticism.  It seems I can never stop:which makes me more angry.  All of my dreams and hopes I had when I was a teenager are now out of my reach, and I boil with hatred and fury inside.  I can't ever let it out because it feels like no one ever will listen or even try to understand . (this includes my family)  I have no close friend or any one to even speak to about, so I try to bury it, but I feel it eating away at me' such that I can't think about anything else; and all I want is peace and quiet from the noise of everything.  I can't think and it makes me even more upset. 
  I just want it too freakin end! I can't get rid of it; I always feel it lingering deep down , lashing out whenever I least want it.  Even when I try to control it, I always forget and can't seem to even think clearly.  I'm not someone who like being angry . I hate that state of my mind; it frustrates me and feeds it even more.  I feel utterly helpless in front of it.  I just want to forget it and never feel this way again! I remember when I used to be happier, but it just makes me feel worse, when I remember.  I feel as though there is liquid fire inside my brain, and I try to remain calm, but I only get more angry and frustrated as always fail. 
    I just want it gone and out of my mind ! I can't stand the anger at myself I'm feeling all the time; I just want some peace .",23Aug2017,1
62,"Hi! I am working through some personal stuff, trying to do some self improvement, learning about myself and how I think, why I do what I do etc. I want to make a lot of positive changes in my life like figuring out motivation, communication, confidence, and also I want to get healthy in pretty much any way you can think of - physically through fitness and diet, emotionally, mentally (have struggled with depression and anxiety). I'm interested in learning yoga and meditation, I would like to start journaling, cooking healthier meals (with more fruits &amp; veggies) and I want to be in nature - I want to start hiking, camping, etc.

So something I've been thinking about a lot is something like a wellness retreat! I first saw the idea from an IG I follow, where they have retreats in different places in the US/South America. Those look wonderful to me, but aren't dates that work for me and are a bit too expensive right now. I've tried looking myself but haven't had much luck! 

I'm in Ohio, and have reliable transportation so could go maybe one or two states over (in any direction). I could maybe swing something farther if it is wonderful :) I would actually LOVE to do one of these in South America if I had the time off/money for it. but anyway, I'm just wondering if there are more options that I am not aware of/haven't been able to find! Or if there are any you've been to personally &amp; had a good experience!! 

Short list/TL;DR: looking for wellness retreat options in/near Ohio with varying price points for a woman interested in nature, health, relaxation, meditation/self-improvement. 

Thank yall very much :)",23Aug2017,1
65,"Honestly ive never opened up about my issues to anyone and I'm feel like vomiting with all the things going on in my head. 

I just need to tell someone anyone cause I don't have any friends and I'm too scared to tell my parents as im not good at opening up about my problems. I just got news from my work that I might be fired. I have a loan I've taken out which still needs to be paid off and I'm scared that once I lose this job I'll be causing a lot of issues for my parents.

The only thing that's keeping me from commiting suicide is this beautiful girl I'm talking to right now (online) we haven't met yet but have made plans to meet soon. I don't know what to do I feel uneasy and honestly feel pathetic that I wanna cry.

I don't know what to do.",23Aug2017,3
