0,"Let me just start by saying that I feel like I need treatment, and would very much like to receive it, but due to certain circumstances I am not currently able to seek help from a professional at this time. I am also not looking for a diagnosis, I'm not really sure what I'm here for, comfort, advice maybe?

Anyways a little backstory: my mother has suffered with severe alcohol addiction my whole life. She would go on binges for weeks sometimes where she would only drink vodka. No eating anything, or drinking anything, just vodka. She would hide in her room away from all of us. Lots of inexcusable things happened during that time, but we eventually moved away from her when I was 14.

I suffered from depression and anxiety in my early teens. I self harmed and became suicidal. My dad put me in therapy, but the woman was a wench, and only made things worse. I don't believe she gave me a correct diagnosis, because our sessions were not private. She invited my father in with us, which kept me from telling her a lot of things.

On top of the depression, I often experienced extreme fits of rage. I could not control my anger, and I was triggered by the slightest inconveniences. I would scream and yell at people, throw things, break things, etc. It was a daily occurrence.  

Currently, I still suffer from the anxiety, depression, and fits of rage. However, the rage has become significantly worse. I am 21 and have a fiance and 2 year old daughter. I have the shortest fuse, and when something sets me off, the whole day is ruined. Sometimes nothing sets me off,  I just wake up angry and agitated with everyone and everything. Those days are the worst. My fiance tries to be supportive, but when he asks me what's wrong, I fly off the handle. It quickly escalates to screaming and yelling at him, calling him names, etc. I feel so bad when it's all said and done, but it literally feels like there is just a rage fueled fire burning inside of me 80% of the time, and I cannot control it. 

Then there will be weeks where I feel great!  I have a ""new"" outlook on life, I become very optimistic, very positive, and I feel good about life in general, even when nothing has changed. It's just a feeling I wake up with. I become super productive and do things that I feel will improve the quality of life. For example, during one of these times, I spent 3 days designing and putting together a financial plan/binder for my family, only to have it sit in our kitchen completely untouched. I've actually done that exact scenario multiple times, I have like 50 different budget plans from the past year, all of which have never once been used. Sometimes this lasts forbade few days, sometimes it lasts for a week or more. 

Then one day, it's like my brain tells me to cut the shit, my life sucks I shouldn't be so happy and positive! Then I go back to my shitty moods again. And it's not just shitty moods, they're all over the damned place! Like, I will reject affection from my fiance for some time, then the next day I can't keep my hands off of him and want to spend all day just explaining to him how much I love him. I can't imagine the toll it must take on him, but I know he's growing tired of it. We are both aware that our relationship is hanging on by a thread, but it's not because of lack of love or faithfulness, it's me..  He's not always so understanding though, he has called me crazy, psycho, etc. I can't blame him, but it makes me feel worse about the situation, as well as myself. 

My mind is always racing with thoughts, and I often feel like Im trapped in prison inside my own head. I can't slow them down or straighten them out, it's driving me insane! 

I'm a fairly normal person, you wouldn't suspect this coming from me unless you were to witness it. I don't experience delusions or hallucinations or anything like that, just more of a constant battle between me and my brain. 

He's getting tired of it, I'm getting tired of it, and I just want to feel better already. I feel Im at the end of my rope, although I have a daughter, suicide is constantly on my mind, but nothing I would ever act on at this point. She needs me here, and I need to be here, it's just so hard when you want to be anywhere BUT here. 

I've always thought my depression/anxiety problems were separate issues, but I've done some research and wonder if it's not the side affects of being bipolar. As soon as I am able to, I will seek professional help. Until then, please, any comfort, wisdom, advice, or similar feelings would be lovely..

But I've always been in a state of okay-then I'm not okay. I'm not sure if I'm bipolar cause I won't really be in a manic then depressive stage seperately- I'm just equally me (kinda hyper) and reserved at the same time or sometimes there's a seperation between the two - but the switch will just be within a couple of days or a lot shorter.

I've messed up a bunch of jobs because I'd go to go for my first day and have a panic attack and not go in. I'm constantly freaking out about what people might think of me or I might do something stupid and people will judge me. it's prevented me from doing so much. I've only been having this anxiety about life and death fairly recently, in the passed month. every night I'm laying in bed almost coming to tears cause I'm so afraid on dieing or someone close to me like my mother or father. I'm so afraid of wasting my life and I feel like if I spend my life working my life will be wasted but you can't survive without making money. but I also feel like what's the point in doing anything because everyone is just going to inevitably die and just not exist anymore so why even bother doing anything",05Jan2017,3,

15,"Hey guys, so, my best friend is a 21 year old male (as am I) and as long as I've known him (since I was very small), I've known he was a little bit off. Not in terms of comprehension or smarts or anything like that but just in the way of his mental health and expressions. 

But lately he came to me because he can't afford therapy and really wants to know what's going on in his mind, and myself being someone who is studying psychology (first year though, I don't have too much indepth knowledge, I couldn't navigate a DSM-5 if you handed me one), figured I could help, but I haven't had much luck with how it has been described

I'll just give a couple of excerpts from the messages from our conversation.

When asking him if he dissociates - ""I am pretty regularly creating and destroying worlds in my head. It goes way beyond day dreaming and I hold in me both a very good mindset and a very angry mindset. Like many times in my life I have literally thought myself into oblivion to escape reality""

My response: When you say worlds, do you mean scenarios, or realities?

Him: ""Yeah worlds but also different realities as well. Ones where I'm usually either the hero or the villain.""

Oftentimes he will get up and walk around, pacing, and when I ask him if he's anxious or panicking he tells me ""No, I'm just having a moment"", and I'm not sure what he means by that, at all

I'm not trying to diagnose anybody, and wouldn't let him see my reddit account if he paid me, but I really just want to know what's going on here, because he is physically disabled and unemployed, he can't get any sort of mental health help through his state appointed healthcare.

This sounds like it could just be a coping method for past trauma but I also worry that it could be signs of DID as well.",05Jan2017,1,

17,"I'm 18 years old and I talk to myself (out loud) almost constantly. I'm an only child and was a latchkey kid, which means I spent (and still spend) a whole lot of time alone. When I was little I had imaginary friends that I would talk to all the time. I've grown out of that now, but I still talk to myself just as much, if not more, than I did when I was little. I have anxiety and ADHD and sometimes it feels like my mind never stops. So I think it's helpful to verbalize my thoughts. It's either talking or writing, and honestly, I prefer the talking. But in addition to just thinking out loud, I'll often come up with these scenarios (like.. meeting my favorite celebrity or some other fantasy/daydream type of thing) and sort of act them out. I mean like full conversations and replying and everything. It's just fun to do when I'm bored or want to pass time. As I'm getting older though, I'm realizing that this is pretty strange haha.

I just worry there's something wrong with me or something.. I mean I don't hear voices or anything. I only do this when I'm alone and/or bored.

19,"I have recently been wondering if I have problems, serious problems. I have never been in a relationship, and have always had issues with women, mainly being petrified of seeming attracted to them, or being sexual in any way. I force myself not to look at women on the street, almost as a reflex at this point. My friends, my sibling, and my father constantly talk about ""hot"" women they see, and I play along, but I feel extremely uncomfortable and disgusted by the end of the conversation. I also do my best not to show any amount of sexual attraction to women when I am talking to them, and feel ashamed/upset if I look at their bodies at all. I don't feel like it's their faults either, they're just people and have the right to their own bodies, I feel like it's my fault, or that I've made a moral error in expressing even a hint of sexual desire. I usually feel anger towards happy couples, or even my own parents embracing or cuddling. I feel dangerously aggressive thoughts when I see people being happy in this way. I've never taken physical action or lashed out( I honestly never would, because I can't conceive of doing that in reality), but I am beginning to wonder if I have some sort of serious problem.

27,"Hi all!
I'm having trouble identifying exactly what's wrong with me. I was diagnosed with major depression in 2012 and been dealing with it on and off for the past 5 years. I'm currently on antidepressants.
Lately, it seems I've had this ""splitting"" going on. For example:
Sometimes I feel super motivated to get stuff done, and then other times, I have no motivation to do the simplest of things.
Some days, I can't sleep (even though I'm tired all day), but then sleep non-stop on the weekends.
Sometimes I get excited about the future and everything it holds, other times I get super overwhelmed and suicide crosses my mind every now and again.
I can plan ahead for a fun weekend with my friends/SO, but when it rolls around, I don't want to leave my apartment.
I feel as though I idolize and love my SO, and then other times, I second guess myself for no apparent reason.
Given my track record, I know I'm normally an ambitious individual... in the past 5 years, I have:
Worked 40 hours a week and took 15 hours of undergrad coursework (every semester)
Graduated with a bachelor's degree
Got promoted
Got a 2nd job and picked up bartending with no experience
Learned a whole new instrument by myself and got good enough to be in a top-12 DCI World Class drum corps hornline
In addition to working full time and going to school full time, I was a volunteer member of the local university's marching band
Earned a new job in a new city, post graduation (earning 14K more than my last position)
Lost 30lbs by having a routine, eating healthier and working out 6 days a week
Moved to a new city by myself
I'm a 23 year old female. Just did the move and got the new job 5 months ago. I realize I was at my best when I was in a routine, but I can't seem to get my shit together since I moved. Everything seems to take a lot of effort and my chores are piling up. Part of me doesn't care and the other half is having extreme anxiety about it.
Anyone have any ideas about this? I'm at a loss here... =/",05Jan2017,2,

My Dad's been recently showing bouts of high energy, increased self worth, confidence and creativity.

He set up a business in this period and spends recklessly on it. 

He also believes that he can heal other people, and many people are taking advantage of that by flaterring him so that he gives them money. 

He tries to help others with their family issues etc etc.

He believes he has a connection to God and that he is a chosen one and that all he says is right.

My mother is working abroad, so it's pretty difficult living like this, 

As you know, India is a pretty shitty place for mental health, there's a lot of stigma.

My mother says he displayed the overreligoisty a decade or so ago, but then reverted to normal..

I think he could have hypomania from his thyroid problems with alternate between hypo- and hyper.

31,"First off, this isn't really stress per say. I think I'm just overhyping myself, and this is gonna sound retarded. 

But I feel like a failure for not being able to write. Im a good writer, and this started last summer when I was like ""hey i think i could write good fan fiction- fuck it"" and started writing for fun. I freestyled the whole thing and got 12k views and a lot of fans and people loved it. It made me feel worth something. I uploaded nearly every day, feeling guilty when I didn't and continued until last christmas break when i would be without a phone. 

I never got back in the groove and barely updated, and when I did and was ready to get back in the game. not the same amount of love i got was back and I just kinda stopped. 

Since then, the past year I continuously published books then would take them down shortly after when not many people read it. Im a freshman and feel stupid when i realize how devoted i am to fucking fan fiction, but it helped me escape 8th grade and i don't think I would be here if it wasn't for the fanfic and the my fans. 

I wanna get back in the writing community and get love again, the characters were awesome and it made me feel original. But now I just spend most my free time writing drafts of multiple fanfics and over analyzing characters and hating myself when I realizing I'm cookie cutting everything.

40,"I'm a 21 yo student, F. I've had some trouble with my emotions and stuff since forever (parents stuck in a miserable marriage, father a really hard person etc.), but especially for the past two years. And I keep telling myself that I'm just being lazy, going through a faze or using pms as an excuse. I'm scared in a way that maybe I'm just making a big deal out of something normal so I'm scared to talk to people because everyone gets sad sometimes and maybe I'm a lazy peace of shit and I'm ashamed. But I think it's having too much of an impact in my life so I just want to ask.

- I have lots of moodswings and I think they get worse when I'm under pressure and I really thought they were pms related (and maybe they are) but they're happening more often. let's say I feel ""normal"" for a week and then I get 2, 3 day of feeling low

- during these low periods I feel constant paranoia like everything is wrong but can't figure out what is, anxiety, too emotional, lots of crying over everything

- (didn't think much of this but then i saw it somewhere so not sure if it's a thing) trouble with sleep, can't fall asleep, terrible nightmares (later can seem like fun stories to tell but not at all while you're having them, sometimes I even wake up crying, but that can just be because of my imagination),wake up tired no matter how much I sleep

- self esteem issues not related to looks but I'm having trouble with dealing with the feeling of being mediocre and not good enough for what I wanted to be and even worse not sure what I want to be and I'm not happy with my university so that might also have some impact and I'm thinking about changing it because I think it's affecting badly on my mental health and I get pannic attacks at the thought of my future

- I thought of leaving this out because I don't know. It happened maybe like twice and I'm sure that I wouldn't do it but I thought it maybe would be easier to kill myself but then I concluded that I don't have it in me. But that is not that uncommon.

I'm scared. I don't want these feelings.  I have this terrible feeling of being lost and not being able to deal with life. I should be happy. I have the most wonderful boyfriend and amazing best friends whom I love very much and who love me. I shouldn't feel this way. It's hard.
Please can someone tell me am I making things up?",05Jan2017,2,

Fair warning, this wasn't supposed to be presentable.. My handwriting is SO fucked up. I've never been able draw a straight line. It looks like the scrawls of a mentally unstable man, because they are lol. I don't feel comfortable answering questions about my ramblings and I'd really never post something this personal but it has helped me enough that I'd be a real asshole to not share it and potentially help other people. 

Its really simple. You mark the day and the time if you wish and then write down how you are feeling or anything out of the ordinary. Any time you think you're going down, grab your stupid book and write a few things. If nothing bad happens, write a summary at some point before the next day. I've tried electronic journaling and it just doesn't have the same effect. I'm less likely to actually write anything, or read it during a crisis.

Why is this useful? I've found many reasons in such a short time.

It helps you keep track of the effects of your medication. If you are experimenting with dosages or different medications, you cannot keep that well organized in your head. No way. I was on 2.5 antidepressants, Welbutrin, straterra(.5), and viibryd. I dealt with sleep paralysis and hallucinations for 2 months. I'd also wake up for no reason after a very short sleep no matter how tired I was. This lead to massive exhaustion and constant yawning all day every day. Wake up for 3-4 hours, too tired to do more, go back to sleep. Which was a constant PITA because sleep paralysis is very obstructive. And the hallucinations are weird. But I didn't want to fuck up the happy that I managed to get. And I am stupid and won't go back to the doctor to get help with the symptoms. And, its really difficult to track the symptoms if you don't write them down which I hadn't even considered. Because I'm stupid. I'm telling you the day I only took half a viibryd I slept so good with no weird hallucinations. Thats when it clicked that dosages make a big fucking deal. So I thought if half a viibryd is good, no viibryd would be even better! I was right but generally thats a stupid move and it bites me later. I've read such good things about viibryd for some people but for me it was a nightmare. I tried to stop my straterra and welbutrin as well, without any tapering because I got it in my head that they were causing my weird persistent cold. The few days after were pretty bad and because I wrote it down I saw direct cause and effect. Stop medication, feel suicidal. Sounds pretty obvious yeah? But in these very low states, I might have found other reasons to explain it or not bothered explaining it at all.

It helps you look at your freakouts more rationally at a later time. In only 3 days I wrote down 'thoughts gone negative. Ruminating on negative things just to make myself feel bad. Why?' I googled rumination after I wrote that because I wasn't sure why I chose that word and I wasn't entirely positive I knew what it meant. But, I did and it turns out its actually a psychological term that describes exactly what I do to myself. It also comes along with NATS(Negative Automatic Thoughts). Its when something simple happens like.. you're trying to talk to someone and they won't even look up from their phone. Then out of no where you think 'Im a loser' 'I'm gonna die alone'. Rumination is where your brain takes these thoughts, puts them on repeat and walks the fuck off. Just seeings these concepts clearly defined really helped me. The next day, another loop started and I managed to fend it off by remembering that its some stupid automatic process and it can fuck right off. I made a page specifically for my NATs. Its important to right down the specific thoughts that you have over and over. That will trigger you to remember what you've read about them instead of ruminating. I also learned about neuroticism as it was mentioned in the rumination article.

TL;DR Write down your state of wellbeing and anything that stands out each day and you will start to catch the bad stuff as it happens and potentially stop it or learn about it. You'll have a direct record of your state of mind and just writing a paragraph or less will help you remember specific days more easily.",05Jan2017,33,

43,"Question in the title. 

What do people generally do when the cause for the mental health symptoms cannot be found? I've asked doctors this and they say see a therapist to find the cause. If you have done so, and no cause can be found AND you were normal at one point, then what do you end up doing? 

What kinds of things do you even discuss with a therapist when there isn't much to say other than ""I feel depressed and don't know why?""  

What do you do with the thought patterns worksheets when the emotion/feeling of depression is itself the problem and you keep wondering how long it will take for it to go away and return to your normal self? Basically a scenario where you are stressed because of how you feel internally. 

Is that a point where meds will help more than therapy? ",05Jan2017,1,
