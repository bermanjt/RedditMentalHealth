3,"I have some mental issues that I want to talk about, but I don't know who to talk to. The seven counselors and two psychiatrists at my school are notorious for their mistakes (such as outing queer students without their consent and telling others that life is purposeless). The teachers at my school are legally required to tell counselors about any major problems a student has, or else they risk losing their job. I love my parents, but they're honestly a bit clueless about handling mental health issues well, and I'm afraid that they would go off at me. I also don't have any friends who respond to me outside of specific events like scout meetings, and the one friend that actually had a conversation with me outside of school or a meeting in the past six months has a weird obsession with a girl she crushed on and spent thirty minutes asking to look at my personal documents when she came to my house. I've tried several online resources, but they've all been pretty useless. I also can't get out of the house without telling my parents where I'm going two or three days in advance, so driving myself to a mental health center isn't an option.

TL;DR: I want to deal with my problems but all of my resources for help are exhausted, nonexistent, or more harmful than beneficial. If you have any advice, it would be appreciated.",17May2017,1
4,"Using a throwaway because people know my real account and I don't want to worry them.

I've been feeling a sort of apathy for many aspects of my life lately. I don't know how to explain it fully, but basically I feel like nothing I do will affect anyone. Anything I do isn't real.

For example: I'm bisexual and frequently speak out on LGBTQ issues. But I feel like my sexuality isn't real so I can't speak about those issues.
Any friends I currently have? They're just friends by proximity. They don't really care about me. They're not really friends.
Any problems I have with family? Not real. Everyone else has real problems. Not me.
Grades. GPA. My status as a ~straight A~ student. Doesn't matter.

The thing is, I don't think it's anything like disassociation. I still know I'm a real person in the real world. It's just that nothing I do will affect anyone. Nothing about me is real, but I am a real person. Does anyone know what to do to combat this feeling?",17May2017,7
8,"Hello, I have a question and I wasn't sure what sub to post this in however I feel people here would be able to give me some insight. 

I have a very particular mental experience that has come and gone in my life and I would like some answers on it as I had a bad experience with it yesterday.

The experience is this:

I hear multiple voices in my head arguing with each other. They will say vague, general terms such as, ""think about it"" or ""you must do it"", ""you can't do this"", ""stop"", ""listen"". These are random examples and they don't seem to have much meaning. The only connection between the terms and phrases are they all seem to be commands, like I'm being told off or something. The voices are generally shouting and I cannot voluntarily stop or start the experience.

The experience is consistent in the following ways:

Always the same voices. One particular voice stands out of an old fashioned woman.

Always multiple people arguing.

This is the only kind of experience like this that I have had. I have never heard voices other than this experience or had hallucinations of any kind.

The experience is not common. It started when I was younger (12)and was more common then. Once I turned 16 I never had the experience again until this year (I'm 20 now).

I knew it was the exact same experience as it was so familiar and it surprises me so I know it is the same. It has happened about 3 times thus year, the most recent being yesterday.

I was working through the night on revision and suddenly it started for 3 minutes and I tried to ignore it but it was too powerful a feeling. The voices were loud and I was trying to get it to stop.

I am a regular weed smoker however the experiences started long before I started smoking and did not occur at all in the first few years of me smoking. They are also not triggered by smoking I just thought it may be relevant information. I am also on Concerta medication for Adhd.

If anyone could help me understand this experience it would be very helpful to me and I would be happy to explain anything else.

Anyone I describe it to immediately says schizophrenia however I have not had any other symptoms of any sort that relate to that. I am quite an anxious person but nothing over board.

Side issue:

Another issue that I thought I'd throw in is this:

Since this year I have consistently been having the same dream, that my teeth are falling out. It feels like my biggest fear when I am sleeping but when I am awake it is not a fear at all. Sometimes when i am awake I feel for my teeth thinking they aren't there and then realizing it was a dream. This is how I remember I had the dream.

Thanks for the help :)

Edit: if anyone could recommend a subreddit that this post would be better suited that would also help. ",17May2017,6

I just let a puppy fall down the stairs at my in-laws' when I was tasked with watching them.
He'll be okay, but my wife is scared, now, that I am going to let something like this happen to our future child.
And I'm scared, too. Just sitting here I realize how surreal all of existence feels. Nothing seems real or palpable. My emotions are going from guilt and shame for being so inattentive to flat-lined and numb.

13,"I often feel besieged by frantic, racing, fragmented, distressing thoughts. After trying to make some sense of my mental health ""stuff"" for over a decade through journal writing, talking with endless therapists/counselors/healers/friends/anyone who I trust and who will listen, researching 'it' ad nauseum, there is still a quality to my inner experience that I find totally distressing and totally powerless to describe. 

The reason I'd like to describe it is because I view that as an essential first step to solving it. Can't fix a mess until you know what you're looking at.

I even feel trapped trying to describe this experience of being unable to describe it and being trapped because I usually get suggestions that ultimately amount to someone suggesting I 'try a little harder'. It's well intended, but suggesting writing, sharing, counselling, meditating, etc obviously doesn't help significantly enough to make it more bearable.

So I basically just come across like a quitter, self indulgent, and whiner who wants to stay stuck, because I reject the well meaning but ultimately alienating and irritating advice because I've tried it and it doesn't work. The moment when someone gets exasperated because I don't believe their suggested solution will actually get to the heart of the problem hurts immensely because it's when I imagine they are judging me and realizing they need to get away from me. It's a very lonely, painful feeling.

I also get very irritated, even the thought of going through this conversation irritates the hell out of me (I get irritated easily and ruminate about getting irritated and all the things that irritated me, it's irritating).

One of the things I came up with to describe this experience which  I feel unable to describe in detail is, you wouldn't ask someone to give a detailed description of the structure of a ship while it's being crashed around by a storm on the ocean because it's impossible. You can barely stand up, can't really see, and all you can't hear clearly, you're just trying to hold on.",17May2017,2

I'm still fuzzy on when a therapist is allowed to break confidentiality but to my knowledge it mostly just seems when physical violence is highly possible.

19,"I'll just start by saying that I've never had a history of mental health issues, and I've never really been on this reddit page before.

Over the last 2 months or so, I have had this constant feeling of disconnectedness from my body. Like my mind is completely separate from my physical self as it interacts with other people, makes decisions, etc. I feel like I'm looking at myself from above as I do things.

Recently, it's been more of a constant lack of focus. It takes so much for me to concentrate on the conversation, or a game, or work, or pretty much anything. 

More than anything, it's personal conversation that makes me the most nervous. I'll lose focus, zone out, and say something stupid or ignore what's been said. I'll start to feel separate from my body and act awkward while talking to someone.

And I know it's all in my head. I looked up the symptoms a while ago on Google and kind of self diagnosed myself with dissociative personality disorder... and it's gotten in my head even more. 

The best moments are when I forget about it, but recently it's been very hard to. What do I do?

I take Oxcarbazepine and Sertraline. I am for once seeking out help on what to do awhile before the last minute. The Sertraline has no more refills. I don't expect my doctor to approve any more refills. Mid-July was the soonest date available from a psychiatrist I could actually get.

24,"I rarely experience happy moments. I almost never laugh anymore. I have little interest in anything. I'm a college student and I'm involved in some extracurricular activities + I go to the gym regularly, but I'm not really enjoying myself. I'm decent at keeping up with schoolwork. I feel like my personality or ""soul"" is deteriorating into nothing with every passing day. A few months ago, my social anxiety lessened, but I was starting to lose the ability to have fun and engaging conversations with others. Now recently, even my conversations with close friends is starting to turn to shit. Nothing is significant to me anymore. Talking to people feels like talking to a wall, in that it is boring, but I wish it would be fun.

Because of my incredibly boring personality, I can barely have interactions with others. It's not an anxiety issue. Because of this, I've been feeling very lonely lately and I feel very disconnected to the world. I feel like I will never have a sense of belonging.

I want to die, and I plan on killing myself in a few years after I can pay off my student loans and pay my mom back. I feel like my life won't improve, but I want to try to change before I give up. I don't think my desire to die is a part of my mental illness. I just see it as the logical thing to do when you have no reason to live. I want to experience happiness, excitement, and connection with others if its possible. How can I do this? Will antidepressants help in my situation? I don't feel sad at all, just slightly uncomfortable, and very empty and lonely. I've also tried psychedelics, but those didn't seem to change me in the way that I wanted. I may consider going to a counselor, but I don't believe they can help. I think my problem isn't my beliefs or anything like that, but my brain's inability to find life enjoyable. I also tried meditation for a while, but I don't think that will help me either.

27,"Wow so this is 99% a vent but maybe someone has some knowledge I don't know.

Recently I've been having a lot of anxiety about getting into/going to bed, so much that I have stopped sleeping in any kind of bedroom and I now sleep on the couch.  This kind of sucks because I do like sleeping in a bed but the dread of attempting to fall asleep in a bedroom is killing me.  Theres 3 main sources of anxiety, maybe someone could tell me if they are possibly related?  

1: I think I might have OCD.  There is an extensive list of rituals that I perform before I go to bed, every bedroom I've slept in for an extended period of time has different rituals.  They usually involve things such as checking the closet, checking and leaving on the bathroom light, getting into bed a certain way etc.  
There are other ""compulsions"" I have noticed however right now I'm just talking about the ones related to sleep.  
2: I've been increasingly paranoid lately when I get in bed.  When it comes close to bedtime I always get the feeling that there is something watching me, never really anything specific, but just.... something.  It sounds childish, but I have always been a little afraid of the dark.  Usually I think of something walking around the corner into my room, or from my closet, or from the bathroom.  I always sleep with the bathroom light on, I always check my closet door before I get into bed (sometimes multiple times).  

I recently watched a scene from the movie the Babadook and the one bedroom scene was an incarnation of my exact paranoia.  I feel like at any second my door is going to creak open, I'm always looking around the room trying to maintain a feeling of security.  


Regardless, I'm sensible to know that this is all in my head!  However I can't really seem to stop it from happening every night, and it's starting to stress me out.  These feelings have been getting worse since my parents sold my childhood home a year ago (I'm a home body and felt very safe in my old room.)

30,"I am 25 asian male, skinny fit type. I can't seem to relax underwater for somereason. 

When i was 10 I got threw into a deep pool and drown by the teacher during a Bootcamp. But before that i was never fond of water anyway, after that when i was around 14 my parents forced me to learn how to swim and I joined a swimming school. I kinda do what the program taught me supposed to do and learnt how to freestyle swim for 50 meters. But during my swim i am always tense and fear. If i am not in water that is shallower than my height i will tense up so much i always mess up my breathing or i will run out of strength super quick.

After few many years I thought i have overcome a bit, i started to like swimming, going out with friends. I think of facing the fear is part of being a better self, but i would still fail in deeper water nevertheless. 

Recently, i went to a water park and my friends threw me into a pool just as deep as my height, i kinda know and agreed to it too i thought it was funny, but i drowned again.

And now i think the fear has gotten so bad when i think of water i'll get a goose bump, I want to conquer the fear but i have no idea what i should do.

This question is for anyone who's been on venlafaxine
I was on Venlafaxine for about 3 months for anxiety and depression but it made me more suicidal and alot more self-harming so I had to go to my psychiatrist who has just gave me Trazodone 100mg for depression and to help me sleep I have just started Trazodone and she stopped the venlafaxine 75mg completely cold turkey its been about 5 days and i feel like hell! 
I've been vomiting, having shakes, real bad nausea everyday, headaches and brain zaps, i keep feeling dizzy and like i'm going to faint, I can't eat anything and only drink water i've lost 7lbs so far but i was wondering how long is this going to last?! i feel like crying all the time it feels horrible. She told me if the Trazodone also don't work that she was going to switch me to a mood stabiliser. 

But how long will these withdrawal symptoms last? 
Is there anyway at all to ease them even a little? i feel like HELL.

36,"Firstly, I don't know if this is the correct sub to ask this sort of question, but I honestly would like to know the answer to this 'problem' (call it what you will) I've been facing:

I've always thought of myself as an advocate for the facts, obviously that's not true, but that's what I've always striven to be. However, I've started to notice that whenever someone, be it on the Internet or IRL, states an opinion, I'd be quick to disagree with it and cite reasons on why they're wrong and poke holes in their argument. And it's not even because I disagree with their opinion, as when speaking to people I know IRL, I agree with these peoples opinion, since majority of the people I know have similar philosophies and opinions on matters to mine. But when I hear them articulate it, the first thing I think of is a counter argument, and a reason as to why their opinion is wrong. 

While on the Internet, I used to always dispute others opinions, but when doing so I research articles that are opinion pieces without taking a critical look into those opinion pieces I used for my counter argument- which I would also automatically disagree with if I happened by those articles randomly.

Of course, now that I've realised this, I try to present myself as more of a devils advocate. Instead of agreeing or disagreeing with others opinions, I simply state the other side of the argument without actually supporting it. But nevertheless, whenever I read or hear an opinion, my brain automatically reroutes all my thoughts to poke holes into the argument, point out the fallacies, and disagree with it. On the Internet it's easy to collect my thoughts before saying something so I'm able to constrain myself, but while speaking extemporaneously IRL, I would sometimes revert back to the bad habit of disagreeing with the person and putting down their opinion completely as a falsehood. So I'd honestly like to know the reason why, cause this is a detriment to my social skills by sounding like an asshole.

Sorry if this is a bit incoherent, I'm pretty sleepy at the moment of the making of this post.

I have one to three episodes a year where I am majorly depressed. I also have moments of rage and crazy moods. I experience extreme anger and I will scream, cry and throw my body around like a toddler. The more I have these episodes the worse they get. At first it was just this random anger, then I started watching myself so violent things like break things that are important to me, say unthinkably rude things to loved one, and even hit them. I am unable to control my actions and this lasts for a few minutes then I start apologizes and regretting everything, then I go right back to uncontrollable violence. Now Im blacking out during these moments. I have been fired from every job for over sleeping my alarm by 4+ hours, then not contacting anyone from embarrassment. I also think my managers are singling me out to ruin my life. I lose the person I'm dating everytime I have these episodes. Now I am obsessed with topics that include gangs, murder and drug abuse. Im curious but don't see myself actually doing these things. I am becoming a very manipulative person, especially when someone is upset with me. I'll say anything to make them change their mind. I also have always had problems having emotions, especially sympathy for others.

I'm a 29 year old female, engaged to a 31 year old male since Christmas, and as the title says, my anxiety and paranoia is at risk of destroying our relationship.  


When I was 17 I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and OCD. After a few years of cognitive behavioral therapy and working with a psychiatrist and psychologist, I went from being unable to leave my bedroom to living an independent life 400 miles from home. It's now 12 years since that original diagnosis, and while I'm still on my medication, I am settled in my career in a city far from home, and preparing to buy a house with my wonderful fiance.  


My fiance is like my emotional opposite or something. He's confident, optimistic, outgoing, and seems happy the majority of the time. He knows about my issues and has been very supportive, even though he doesn't fully understand how I feel. It can't be easy for him putting up with me - I'm very emotional and cry easily, and I'm very paranoid. I keep getting into strange moods and accusing him of not really wanting to marry me, of only marrying because he's 'settling', etc. It's unfair on him, and he does everything he can to reassure me, but deep in my heart I feel like this wedding just won't happen because he will realise that I'm not good enough for him. What's more likely to happen, is that he will just get tired of my constant paranoid questions and accusations.  


I went on holidays with my mother last week for four days. He spent the whole time messaging me, telling me how much he loved and missed me, and couldn't wait for me to come back. And yet on the plane home, I had a panic attack because in my head, he was enjoying his time without me, had realised he was happier alone, and was preparing to break up with me as soon as I got home. Needless to say, this didn't happen, and he was thrilled to see me. And luckily I had the common sense to not bring it up. But I genuinely believed my horrible thoughts. 


I don't know what to do. I'm at my wits end worrying about him getting to the end of his tether with me, and yet I just can't stop. If I talk about it I'm in danger of losing him. If I don't talk about it, I bottle it all up inside and it bursts out in a horrible tantrum of accusations and hysteria. Should I go to a doctor? Should I confront him and tell him what's going on inside my head, and risk hurting his feelings? Is there a way of making these thoughts fade away?

49,"I've been having a hard time going back and forth with myself about seeking help, if it would be helpful or if I don't actually need it and I'm just whining ect. 
The fact is I'm scared. I'm afraid that this is what life is and that this is who I am now. I'm young and my feelings can probably all be attributed to bad diet and hormones, and I don't want to be that person but how I've been feeling is getting in the way of my life. My grades are falling, I'm failing to pass in the majority of work that I'm given, and I'm not doing much of anything including things I enjoy doing. The smallest thing happens like getting a talking to from a teacher about my missing work and I go home that day preparing to kill myself (Which I wouldn't no matter how much I may feel compelled to because its a disproportional solution to such a trivial problem and shouldn't be an answer). I miss a lot of school because of my self image and I'm ashamed to admit that. I'm ashamed that I turn my back on the front door because I don't want to be seen by other people in the fear that they will hate me as much as I do. This is all stemmed from bullying about my body when I was much younger that I internalized, and I can no longer set foot inside a school gym without feeling afraid. I haven't liked my body or who I was as a person since I was eight. 
During a year stay in the states (I'm Canadian) My mom allowed me to be homeschooled. I ended up starving myself religiously for that year and lost some weight. Habits die hard and I have only gained five pounds back since. Coming back to Canada, and to school last year I realize the only thing I'm behind in is my own work ethic which is practically non existent unfortunately. 
I can't focus on what people say and my brain just floats no matter how hard I try to listen to friends, family, teachers, or peers. Its frustrating that I lose concentration so fast. Even now I'm having a difficult time trying to stay engaged with the words I'm typing. Though this has always been a problem It never kept me from getting the work done like it does now, even if it was done last minute. 
Two years ago I scratched my hand in a single spot on my pointer finger until I broke the skin when I got into a fight with my mom. Two years later it has become a habit whenever I get stressed. The most recent scratch was made 4 days ago on my pinky finger. They resemble lipstick marks in a way. 
This year in particular has been really stressful. My mother had a mini stroke, my sister became too depressed to stay at school and gets into a lot of fights with my mom on a near daily basis, my addict brother had come for a while earlier in the year and devastated the family with his verbal harassment, and I have been the person my mother, sister, and friends come to for support and wisdom. When so many people rely on me I'm too scared to talk to any of them about how I've been feeling. They all have so much to deal with and I don't know where I'd begin if I ever did try to tell them. Any advice on how to help myself or where to go from here would be graciously appreciated. I know I said that I'd never commit suicide but if this goes on any longer I may hurt myself in the heat of a moment. I want to improve. I'm sorry if I sound ridiculous.",17May2017,1
50,"Me and my gf have been together for almost 4 years. Everything has been great.

She lives in a broken home, her moms a drunk. Her Dad sits on the couch and has no relationship with her daughter. All he does is smoke weed, and shoot the shit with her. There's no ""father daughter connection"" as you guys may say...she has daddy issues lol. She's got no attention from him, he loves her, protects her but actions speak louder then words right. He doesn't show attention to her when she goes to her dance competitions, not much emotional love on his end. Anyways...she lacks attention from her father all her life to say the least.

I got her a job, this 50 year old guy worked there and she is 17. I is the known Loser of City. The guys a drug dealer he's a pervert he's got 2 kids and a wife. Anyways, she worked around him and this guy is a pig to say the least. He would always stare at her compliment her, and we all know girls they love attention, who really doesn't? He almost knew she was missing a father figure and he filled the void almost by being so nice and saying things like she's a strong beautiful girl, she's smart etc that her dad never told her.

And so she looked up to him like a friend, like a father, a nice guy. Then he started getting weird hugging her, saying weird things that she blew off because she was almost use to it? This 50 year old guy worked with this kid her age outside the store she worked in. So the 3 of them were constantly there. The 50 year old would drive the guy he worked with home all the time...so with the kid in the truck with my gf and the 50 year old they'd drive her after work..no problem didn't really care because I knew the kid that worked with the 50 year old.

Always, the 50 year old started getting dirty and dirtier saying weird stuff. He would have a Hard on at work and hug her, and she was creeped out but didn't blow him off or anything because it was ""almost normal"" because he was like that. I think it's fucked stupid she never told him to stop but it's like Stockholm syndrome, he manipulated her and took advantage of her, also her having depression etc. And he started doing these things. He would say fucked up stuff saying what he's do to her and she would only laugh and reply ""Oh yeah? Relax there"" not flirting but not putting in end to it.

He drove her home once and he kept bugging her to take her shirt off in the back of his truck. She was scared and froze like any girl would that was just fucked over by someone who she looked up to as a father figure, as a good person. So she did,and she wasn't happy about it her face was blank while it happened, she wasn't teasing him she almost did it just to make him stop because she was so in shock. So he pulled his dick out and started jerking off and he told her to finger herself, so she did as she stared out the window almost crying because what was happening. They never touched each other he kept bugging her to do those things and she ended up doing it. I know you guys will say she's a slut but no she has to take Antidepressants because if it and she is in the process of being diagnosed with possibly Stockholm syndrome where you have a relationship with your abused.

She has cried every night since it happened..how disgusting she felt, how he had mental control over her, how she was just scared of him if she would have said no.

I love her more than anything and she loves me. We still have amazing day but it randomly hits her at night and it's all she thinks about, she hates him, I hate him, I want to kill him. But that won't solve anything.

He got a broken girl to believe the things he told her, said the things he said because he knew he controlled her, and he tried to get more and more out of her when finally, she put and end to it. Quit her job, and her life's been so fucked up and different since.

It's just crazy to hear my gf did those things, but I know for a fact she didn't enjoy any of what happened in the truck. Any girl likes attention like I said but there's a line you don't cross, which he did as he had her wrapped around his fingers. 
He complimented her, became friendly with her, then slowly made his way further and further, playing it perfectly really but I still I can't even believe how she feels and how crazy this is, a guy can never understand what a girl goes through then a man 3 times older then her is trying to take charge and makes a girl, lost without a real father figure in her life, feel so special and important and then does that. That's why she is so upset and crazy about it because he was like a dad to her and her ""dad"" just did that.

Anyways she is being in the process of diagnosis of possible PTSD and/or Stockholm syndrome and possibly more. She is getting Fluoxitine next week and will start therapy the following week or so.

51,"My life recently has become the shitstorm of wrongdoings.
I have always felt a sense of paranoia around anything when it comes to social interaction and various other events in my life.  I often have a feeling, and this feeling felt like everything was collapsing around me, I would distract myself from everyday life, embedding myself in things I enjoy doing rather than things I have to do. However, this in turn has a dramatic effect on the things I should be doing, such as work, finances and basic housework. I end up forgetting a lot of things from being distracted. I would be told information about a job and I would instantly forget it when questioned about it. 
Finance is something I have always struggled with. Without money, I end up in a really depressive state - not because I am unable to buy myself nice things but to pay bills on time. I don't enjoy my job at all, it is the only thing keeping me afloat financially. I don't feel like I am getting anywhere in this job but I am waiting to pick the right moment to go completely freelance and not screw myself over financially. My credit score has been low for a number of years, no idea why, I've never had anything against me financially, however this has caused me issues when finding car insurance, finance options for a car/computer, etc. These are things that send me over the edge.
Today I received a letter stating that I had been caught speeding, the previously mentioned 'feeling' hit me hard. All day I have had a hard time keeping focused, worrying about future, worrying that my job relies on me driving, worrying that I wont be able to ever redeem myself from this. 

Has anyone else ever felt this? Has anyone ever felt like theres no point in being here anymore. I am really struggling with this and would love some advice.

53,"I'm here to see if anyone can help point me in the right direction with regards to my sister, or even just some support.  * Heads up, long read! 

I, myself have suffered with mental illness for half my life. But I am just starting to realize that my sister might have something serious going on. She has also been on anti depressives for depression and anxiety but just in a general way. My whole family has been on them but just from GP's. 
I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, with generalized anxiety and mood swings, although I feel this is wrong. But this is not about me. My sister is 35 I am 28. Just a bit of family history.. 

She has a couple of different sides to her. 

1. She is super caring, friendly, loving and nice! She has been like a second mom to me. She will listen to advice and is able to communicate. She is helpful, supportive and  isn't selfish and is an amazing person/sister/mom. 

2. This is the part that is the worst. She becomes this angry, hostile person. Who is beyond rude and so condescending. Nothing anyone says is right, she knows everyone. If anyone says anything to her she becomes so defensive and starts arguing. 
She is selfish and so rude and a bully. My mother will bend over backwards to help her ( us) and my sister is just beyond rude and un thankful. Also treats my mom like she is stupid sometimes. 
She controls her partner with an iron fist. He can't even make decisions for himself with their family. Then she gets mad at him because he constantly asking her things, Like; When to feed the baby, how to feed the baby. How to put him to sleep etc etc. But if he didn't do her way, all hell would break loose. So he can't win. 
Her whole house and their whole living is micro managed by her. But then she gets so mad at him cause he's annoying her, and acts like a child. But she treats him like a child. She is emotionally abusive, to everyone in her life. 
I tried to explain this to her in a loving way but she gets so defensive. 
It's almost like she can't understand why things are happening the way they are even though it's because of her reaction to everything.
If anyone in our family tried in a loving, caring way, Or in a brutally honest way to tell her about how she is reacting and how she is being very rude, bullying and condescending, it's starts a huge war. We have even tried to just focus on our feelings and how we are feelings about the way she is acting. But that's almost worse. 
Now everyone in my family just tip toes around her. Everything ends up being about her, because no will stick up to her. Because we have tried every way possible. She just never can see where someone else is coming from. Even when multiple people are saying how what she does makes them feel. 
We have been dealing with this for 10+ years. She always thinks we're being mean, or crazy and she isn't acting the way we are saying. 
Sometimes when we talk or argue, it's like she is not seeing reality. I sometimes am mind blown by her reactions to someone saying something nice or caring etc.. It's excessive and worries me. Seems she is out of touch with other people's feeling, emotions and even reality sometimes etc

3. Other times she is depressed, stressed and not happy in life. She spends way too much money on material things, then is stressed over having money for bills! She wants to move out of province to afford things better but wouldn't even be able to afford the move and the cost of living is about the same but she won't see those points or look into the other sides of things. She would be away from her immediate family and we have a very close relationship. 
When she is in one of these moods , she will take advice and support in a loving caring way from the rest of the family. We can actually talk to her about life and changes and things that might help. 
When she drinks alcohol she cannot control herself and makes bad decisions. ( She has history of drug addiction)



Her moods have ruined a lot of family outings and dinners. 
We all have history of addiction, and for the longest time we thought she was still using drugs, or using again. But I know she isn't using drugs ( I'm pretty sure) and am now starting to think there is something else going on. 

Her whole life and everything she does becomes extremely stressful, she also makes everything out be extremely stressful. Getting her older child ready for school in the mornings becomes the biggest job ever. She doesn't work right now. Is home with her new baby. Her house is always rushed and stressful. The children are extremely over stimulated. Partially because she does this to them and the constant stress in the house. Which isn't making anything easier. But again she won't listen to any advice or suggestions! 
Her children are suffering from some of this and we can see the problems of them living in an overstimulated, stressful environment. She has had some serious issues already with her Older child and his behaviours. 

She literally changes between these 3 moods on a daily basis. When she calls I never know which one I will be talking with. Sometimes she just completely takes something completely the wrong way.. Like excessively. Not simply, like we all do sometimes. It's crazy. 

Thank you to anyone who managed to read through this. I'm fairly new on Reddit but this is an amazing place to be able to talk with people, or get help and opinions!

Because I can't do this alone, people hang up on me and don't help me and are impatient and I can't do this stuff without guidance, no matter how hard I try.

56,"What I'm looking for here is if I should look into therapy, if it might help, if its something I should pay for. I live in a very small town and we have one lady for mental health and I don't want to be too awful about her, but she hasn't worked for me. Maybe I just want to run down the stuff thats made me concerned.

I don't remember the start, but I remember being told I couldn't have a bottle anymore because it would damage my adult teeth. I remember my mother trying to take it from me and I screamed until I threw up everytime she tried. I remember trying to shower with my clothes on and being told I couldn't, so I used to bathe with my socks on until we had a pool holiday and I could make an argument for bathing with swimsuits. It was fun. I could pretend I was swimming. I remember I used to cry if my Mother or Grandmother tried to leave me. I remember being so angry I thew my bottle against the door and it smashed, I cried until I was sick because I knew my Mother wouldn't give me a new one. I have to restate, I was old enough that the dentist was worried about it ruining my adult teeth.

I remember that same room, I don't know how long later, getting caught punching myself in the stomach. I knew in a subversive way it was wrong, which is why I always tried to do it with the door closed. But this day my Mother caught me. She freaked out, I guess, asked me about it, I don't know. All I remember of that is being fucking ashamed I let her see me do it. She took me to the only Therapist in town, hereby referred to as Therapist.

At some stage I checked out with school, I don't remember ever being active in it really, I tried once or twice but it wasn't worth it. I don't know, apparently I was into it when I was a kid. I know it sounds stupid but unless someone tells me about something that happened when I was a kid, a lot of it is vague. I can remember a lot of family stuff, but the rest besides the standard humiliation is gone. You know, that and `oh we can't watch the movie in here, we have to watch it in the bedroom.` It was a shark movie. I didn't/couldn't sleep unless someone like my Mother, Grandmother,  cousin or cousins' parents were in the same room.

I don't know what Therapist thought of me, spoilt brat was probably it, and Therapist would have probably nailed it. My Grandmother died, and I self harmed for while, told people I was you know, thinking about killing myself. Never my Mother or my family though, in fairness to them. Self harmed, a lot. Told a teacher because I guess I had to tell someone. She said she would have to tell my mother but she would give me the day to tell her myself. So I went and told my Mother.

Got some time with a Doctor lady who was amazing. She would see me once a week and just listen, and when I was being a shit she'd say stuff like `oh well do you think that's fair?` or the like and it helped, an awful lot. Was okay.

Then 19, new years day, this guy who has always been around but never liked hanging out with him over much- he's a nice dude but boring and awkward. Was walking home from a family new years party and he says `I never told you what to do I just showed you` and its like, there I am all of a sudden back in his shitty black car, there is the flash of a belt buckle, there he is saying `oh the DVD player doesn't work in here, we have to watch the shark movie in the bedroom.`

That's all. That's it. I got nothing besides that. I don't know if its an actual issue or if its just imagined. He's a good guy. He was in love with my Mother. So, you know, it wouldn't even have been me he wanted. I'm 27 this year and I've never had sex. There are six people I will let touch me and three people I'm okay with touching me - my Mother and my youngest cousins, one is a few years younger than me and we grew up together, I'd trust everything to him, and the other is his younger sister who is 8. I can't tolerate things in my mouth- I brush my teeth in the shower because for whatever reason its' less awful there. If I think about it too much when I'm eating I have to stop. I'm probably bi or something, I don't know, I've tried boys and girls but I'm dead from like the lips down. If I kiss someone I spend the next week brushing my teeth until I bleed. Which is hilarious right? But some dickhead thought it would be funny to say `when you kiss someone their saliva is in your mouth for six months` and I don't know if its true, it doesn't matter, if it was I'd cut my face off. 

But, yeah, I went to see Therapist not long after the guy said the thing that freaked me out. I said `hey, I think I was sexually abused.` She said `do you know who by?` and I said yeah, I thought so but I didn't know, I didn't know I don't know I don't know, right I don't know. She asked for his name. I wouldn't give it. I won't. What if it is all in my head. I don't know, but Therapist  isn't an option. There seem to be online options but they are expensive. Obviously I don't want to fork out a shitload of money if it might just be that I'm neurotic or something. Or if it won't help, I guess. Some advice, I guess, and sorry. I guess I wanted a rant. 

Uh, TLDR; local therapy isn't an option should I look into paying for online therapy?",17May2017,1

61,"I self reported my bipolar diagnosis to my PCP at the health system in my community. I also reported the serious reactions I've had to various psych meds. I did that in the spirit of keeping all of my providers in the loop. Bad choice.

Now, if I need to go to the ER for something or see a specialist in the same network, I am immediately confronted with providers who make assumptions about me entirely based on my psychiatric diagnosis. I sit in triage in the ER with conditions like extreme migraines that have lasted longer than 3-4 days or, in one case, a failing gallbladder that required surgery, behind nearly everyone in the waiting room with literally a skinned knee because the triage nurse decides that I am ""just a psych patient complaining."" I have actually overheard those words from the triage nurse. 

The other assumption I face is that I am just a ""drug seeker."" This is in spite of the fact that I have a stated major reaction to opiates. They can read my chart long enough to see ""bipolar"" because it's the first thing listed on my chart, but they don't bother to look further down. 

So, clearly this has to go. It has no real medical significance on my chart there since my psychiatrist is not a part of that health system and the medications I am on are explained by a chronic migraine diagnosis. I am fully capable of telling providers this information on a case-by-case basis if it is necessary, but it needs to be off of my chart.

I am in Michigan if that makes a different. 

The patient relations office of this system has argued with me that although I am the one who reported this, I cannot have it removed. 

It is a HUGE problem. ",17May2017,3
62,"I'm in the USA, if that helps. I've been to two therapy sessions in the last three weeks, and I'm going to my third one tomorrow. I started going to fix depression that has been going on for close to a decade, as well as some more recent anxiety issues and some mild gender dysphoria issues.

During my first meeting with him, my therapist suggested I think about antidepressants if I'm not better within a couple of weeks. He also seemed more interested in the gender dysphoria than I thought was warranted, but since then I've started to believe that he is right and it may be causing part of my depression.

I feel quite comfortable talking with him, but I'm wondering if his method is a good one for me. All we do is chat, and I'm not making any changes to my life. Part of me feels like I should be making changes on my own, without his encouragement (which is true), but it makes me wonder if he is helping or not.

My anxiety has been through the roof since I started seeing him because I'm overthinking all the problems he has helped to bring up that I managed to ignore in the past. It is good to acknowledge these problems, in a way, but I feel like acknowledging my problems is not helping if I'm not going to do anything about them.

I have heard that therapy is very self-driven, but I was expecting more structure from therapy instead of just chatting. Is that just what therapy is? An unbiased friend? I already have trouble getting anything done in my life, and I don’t really know how to create my own structure for this.

Should I stick with him for awhile, since I feel comfortable talking to him? Or are there better approaches to therapy? I have been considering the antidepressants, but I’m a bit nervous about them and don’t want to jump into it before I’m certain.
