0,"I've just been diagnosed bp and I'm struggling with the emotions of something like that. I mean I knew something was wrong, but when he(the doctor)said it I felt both relieved and disappointed/sad. It's weird. So today I picked up my meds and I'm worried. I have never had to take anything like that and I guess I'm overthinking. I don't want to become a zombie mom and wife. I'm supposed to be starting college again soon and I don't want to fail because I can't think. What if it makes me worse?.....it's just a lot to process.",19Apr2017,2
3,"I live in the US

A few months ago my brother (20 years old) had a total breakdown after failing his classes and going on academic probation. 

He was committed to a mental health ward after running away, but after he made a threat to other patients, they had to put him in a seperate ward with others who were at risk of running or being a danger to others. It was pretty much like prison (well, not really, but we could tell it was bad). After two long weeks he was discharged and given mood stabilizers and meds to help him sleep. He was progressively getting better.

Then today, 3 months after being discharged, he tried to OD on his medication, saying no one cares about him.

I admit, I'm not able to spend a lot of time with him anymore, having a full time job and a family of my own. But it seems a bit unfair that he expects me to always be there. I can't just quit my job and neglect my wife to hang out every hour of every day.

He's developed an unhealthy obsession with League of Legends and Cabal again. And as someone who has been really into gaming at his age, I can say with absolute certainty that it is an obsession. Nothing else matters. Sleep doesn't matter. School doesn't matter. Friends don't matter. I can see that it's a depressing life, and I've been there. But he makes 0 effort to make new friends and hang out with people.

He doesn't sleep. All he wants to do is vape and play games.

Maybe I'm just giving him the classic older sibling ""you're throwing your life away. You can do better"" speech too much. Maybe I do need to sacrifice more.  Truth is that although he doesn't feel loved,  before I went to college, he was my closest friend. My parents weren't able to spend as much time with him as they did with me, but they still tried, but he still thinks they don't care (which I feel is natural for that age). He literally has everything: a computer, a ps4, an xbox, a phone,  a car, and loving parents who workes hard to give him all the things they could never give me.

Anyways, I feel like I'm rambling. He's in the ICU but is stable. I don't know how to help. Maybe I just needed to vent. Any help is appreciated.

4,"I am a strong believer in mental health advocacy and reducing the stigma around mental illness.

Coming from a traumatic childhood I have had issues with depression, dissociation, anxiety and PTSD. I freely talk and share my experiences of the past as well as how my mental afflictions impact me to this day.

However, there are two sides of the coin. People with mental health afflictions will have different needs and issues that they are dealing with. They may be less social or anxious in certain situations, things may be triggering to them. 

However, this does not excuse how we should treat other people, or how people should respond to us if we are treating them badly.

We need to make sure that despite the issues that we have, that we still treat others with the same kindness that we would want in return. 

Unexplained rudeness, abruptness, absence, anger or other outbursts can be quite distressing and off putting to the uninitiated/uneducated - it may cause distress to others.

I talk about this more here http://www.zachary-phillips.com/blog/noexcuse

But the point is that whilst we will have requirements that need to be understood, we have to also understand that other people dont know our issues and also may get offended by things that we are unintentionally doing.

I think that the best way to address this is by talking about mental health and sharing resources that best help to explain it.

10,"So, to give a bit of background (tw, for possible abuse? idk if it's abuse?), I'm 18 and I live with my parents. My life, I would say, has never been dandy with them. I was kicked out of the house 5 times before I hit 14 and forced to sleep outside for one of those nights in the middle of fall. 
I was threatened to be kicked out many more times than that and when I was 16, or somewhere around there, my mom yelled at me about slamming the door, the argument escalated, and she decided she wanted me gone, but she got physical. She started pushing me and I dropped to the ground so I could hang on to the railings so I wouldn't move, but then she proceeded to kick me to move me, and I started sobbing and hyperventilating and the hyperventilating just got worse and worse to the point where i couldn't breathe for 5-10 seconds straight at sporadic intervals, but all she did was to tell me to shut up and stop crying; my sister had to rescue me and she was the one to calm me down.

And at 15, I made a public post online where I called my dad out on his bs for threatening to throw me out based on differing opinions (and it was an opinion about who looked better than who) and said, and I quote, because I remember this quote as clear as day, ""...I don't like it when he gets like this.""
He stormed into my room, picked me up out of my chair, and then proceeded to pick up by the front of my body, collar of the shirt,  and slam me against my floor, screaming at me. My brother and sister tried to rescue me, but were scared of my father. I actually pissed myself from both the forces of the slams and out of pure fright; i don't think i've ever been so scared for my own life.
He then turns himself into the victim by saying, ""you told all your friend that you hate me! That hurts!""

And, of course, there have been more incidences, but these are the ones that I remember every detail of.

Since that encounter with my dad, I've developed depression, I know that much, but now I'm realizing other aspects of myself that I think I might have gotten from these kinds of experiences, but I'm not really sure? Would this even be considered abuse or am I being soft?

Anyways, the recent developments that I've been noticing is that anytime my parents want me to change something about myself, I feel the absolutely overwhelming need to do the exact opposite. Ex. They tell me to lose weight, that I'll look better, but whenever they tell me to, I feel an anger and then the need to gorge myself and make myself look absolutely disgusting, though I don't want to do that, though I legitimately want to lose weight.
I also get really upset when somebody directs me specifically to do something ie. if they say, ""Do this, right now,"" I don't like it.
And I also get extremely, extremely angry when people raise their voice at me; I go into an absolute fury over it and cannot stand when people raise their voices at me. Well, I either get furious over it and/or I just dissolve into a puddle of tears.

I don't know... does this mean anything or am I just being ""too sensitive""? Should I see someone about this if I can?",19Apr2017,2

12,"Located in the US.

My father is in his early 60s, it seems that over the past 10-15 years that he has become increasingly a more negative and hateful person. I am nearly 30 and yes, I do still live at home with both him and my mother who are married, and my mother has also noted a change like this in him. I don't know why he has become this way, but it's to the point where we both prefer when he's not around because of how he acts. He is not violent, but he refuses to accept blame or responsibility for any disagreement or issues.

As an example, we prepared dinner while he was working. He works late each weekday, so we save him a plate of food or get him something from wherever we end up eating or having. The portions were a little smaller this time as we were a bit low on ingredients so we had to make do. We had plenty for my mother and myself to eat, but we ate less so he could have a plate of food. When mentioned that this was the case, he immediately wasn't even willing to see if the food we saved was enough for him to eat. He just proceeded to disregard us asking him to just see if it was enough, faked like he was leaving to further irritate us since we ate less to save him some, and then comes back in pretending he was never going to leave in the first place (He thinks it's funny to make others mad and just laughs when it happens, and is so persistent the only way to stop him is to just go somewhere else). After seeing how much was there, he points it out and starts complaining even more about how it wasn't enough and so on.

It eventually devolved into how he thinks my mother doesn't love him anymore, and how both my mother and I are against him and don't want to be around him. He has suggested to me that he thinks my mother doesn't want to be married anymore, but with how he behaves I strongly think it is he who doesn't. And I don't know to what benefit, he's such a negative person that while he can get along with coworkers (barely) he doesn't have any friends and even regularly pisses off his own family and says he doesn't care. He assumes the worst in any given situation. He had a decent job years ago but said the work stressed him out and he was terminated for saying something rude to a coworker. He has a much lower paying job now at a warehouse, but complains of aches and pains all the time.

It's impossible to judge if he is genuinely having them or not, as he largely makes a huge deal about any ache or pain to where like the boy crying wolf it's hard not to be indifferent. I think he expects to be babied and coddled any time he mentions an issue, but he's negative so often that it's hard to be very sympathetic. We don't treat him poorly at all, but he expects royal treatment which none of us ever expect or get. He regularly argues about anything and everything, and always blames whoever the other person is of constantly arguing with him rather than accepting that whatever his stance is on a given subject is the correct one.

We've been extremely tolerant of his negativity but it's stressing both my mother and me out and I'm afraid he might get his way and end up alone. I don't want that for him, but he doesn't feel the need to seek help or that there's anything wrong with him mentally. I can see a future of him living alone and mostly cut off from almost all of his family that he's insulted or offended over something stupid and petty and getting depressed enough with being alone and his pains/aches to become suicidal. He is not 24/7 negative, but at times he becomes very blaming and accusatory.

Is there anything else we can do to try and reverse this in him? I feel like the real answer would be professional help, but there's no convincing him. I have been to a psychiatrist for anxiety issues in the past, but even then he joked that I was ""crazy"". I just want my father to be a typical father who's there for me, loving, and caring, and not always blaming people for things that go wrong or being spiteful. I feel like he still is, but he tries to go as far as possible when the hate flares up in him to incite anger in others at him. He will say the nastiest things he can think of and we usually just try not to react but it's very hard sometimes not to. And he absolutely does not stop. The relentlessness of his hate flare ups is astronomical. He becomes completely irrational when those happen and nothing stops him short of him finally slamming a door and going into another room - when he's done. He does not drink, smoke, or take any drugs besides prescription medication and isn't really addicted to anything. In fact, he doesn't have much of any interests and belittles my mother and I for having things we enjoy doing.

I know this is a long post, so long shot that anyone will care to read this all but any help would be really appreciated. I'm at my wits end, I don't know what to do. I nearly have enough to buy a home which was my intent all along, and he's making me really want to move out to get away from him. But I feel that's not solving the problem and just leaving my mother to deal with it all.",19Apr2017,3

14,"Living with Borderline Personality Disorder....my story. 

I was first diagnosed with BPD about 3 years ago. I have had no treatment since but have been re-assessed multiple times by different psychologists/psychiatrists with the same results as well as most also labeling me ADHD. 

This is what a day in my life looks/feels like:

Getting out bed is a struggle. Not just your typical 'Fck Mornings' struggle. I'm talking about waking up to an emptiness that fills you and crushes you. That makes the idea of making it through another day seem nearly impossible. I look over at the mirror and regret it immediately. I look awful. I drag myself to the shower where I sit while the water pours over me. There are no thoughts in my head...just a constant whirlwind of meaningless images and words racing through my mind. 

By the time I finish my shower and step out onto the soft rug and grab my big comfy towel the sun is shining. I look out and smile at the birds in the trees. I dance over to my mirror, brush my teeth, then quickly throw on some makeup and skip to the bedroom. I get dressed for work and walk back over to the mirror where I admire myself. I look awfully cute today! 

I rush down the stairs to my car. Oh no, I'm late. I back out onto the street and become overwhelmed when I see the traffick has already begun to build up.  My hands tense up and tightly grasp the steering wheel. A car mergers in front of me and I contemplate crashing into his rear end. Fcker. I make my way through the traffick, honking my horn at everyone who even looks in my direction. Why is everybody such shitty drivers? 

I make it to work just in time. My boss tells me I can start right away and I smile as I run back to grab my apron and prance out into the dining area and greet my first customer of the day with a huge grin just as I will every customer after. 

Finally my shift is over and Im sent home. I made 100$, awesome! I drive home and not only is there no traffick but I hit every green light... Or so it feels. What an amazing day! The best day ever. My life is great! 

I get home and the apartment is a mess. My boyfriend is lying in bed with the cats. I storm in and ask him why the apartment is such a disaster. He tells me to calm down. I don't. Rage fills me and I begin to yell. At first it is about the apartment. It kind of makes sense. Then I begin to yell about how lazy he is. And then all of the sudden things take a big twist and Im standing there yelling about nothing. Things slowly stop making sense and I quickly lose energy. I break out into tears and go sit on the couch. Why do I feel like this? 

My boyfriend comes over and I fall into his arms and apologize for yelling. He tells me its okay and reminds me that he loves me and how great our lives are. He gives me a kiss and offers to clean up and make dinner. I help him and before we know it the apartment is bright and shiney. We chat about our day as we eat out Kraft Dinner. Everything is fine and dandy. 

I crawl into bed, my boyfriend passed out beside me. I stare at the wall across from my bed and the emptiness returns. I am alone. I am all alone.

Who i am: Im a 15 y/o studying at Tafe (Australian College for trades) i dropped outta school mainly due to anxiety and stress.

What the issue is: So for some reason every year i go through a mental health cycle, 

Jan - April; Happyness, joy and making new friends

April to August; deppression / anxiety / no motivation 

August to Jan; ""Normal"" nothing special

**Notable Issues:**
-For what ever reason i feel most anxiety during the AUG - JAN period.
-I feel most like my self during the APRIL - AUG phase.

**Depersonalization** ?? 

I dont exactly understand what Depersonalization is but anything apart from APRIL - AUG i just dont, feel like me the only way i can describe it is as if im just looking through the eyes of somebody living their life and i dont get angry and annoyed (im typically VERY cynical and make comments about anything anybody says) 

I honestly cant explain it with words but its almost as if my personality disappears and instead im just, Happy but i never feel right and if i look in the mirror it just straight trips me out ([feels like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTRhjpJ4dJM)) like i find it incredibly uncomfortable (im not concerned with my looks)

36,"I know for a fact that I'm unable to experience normal human emotions due to genetics AND biology, but for some reason I experience incredibly real feeling ""emotions"", even if I know that they're not real

Like since I'm evil and thus can't experience real emotions, you'd think I'd have some control over them right?? Basically I know for a fact that everything I do is acting, but it all feels so so so real, like when I can't stop crying or get very scared

Other evil people use their lack of emotions to an advantage - they fake things like empathy, happiness, etc to put themselves at an ADVANTAGE and MANIPULATE OTHERS, and they're charming and don't fuck things up by suddenly screaming or bursting into tears (because they don't even have the emotions that causes those things - they just fake whatever emotion is advantageous to them at the time)

But why can't I do this????? How can I stop my subconscious mind from taking over my fake emotions and using them in ways that aren't helpful to me?

I know that I don't have any mental health issues and actually have very good mental health simply because of the fact that, as an evil being, i cannot experience true emotion

Truly biologically evil people are immune to mental health problems due to the lack of normal human emotion

so that must mean that there is some advantage to me having ""emotional breakdowns"" since there is essentially no reason I shouldn't be able to control the fake emotions since they're not even fucking real to begin with!!! Jesus fucking Christ, so clearly it's somehow advantageous to me to scream randomly and cry for hours and become scared, but I don't understand WHY this is advantageous. All I can think of is that my subconscious mind is doing the acting, and trying to arouse sympathy in others? Or maybe it's to try to convince myself that I'm not actually evil?? Maybe my subconscious mind is saying ""hey, if we act these emotions well enough to where they feel real, i must not be evil!!!!!!!!!!""

But this isn't fucking making me happy, you'd think that someone with perfect acting abilities like me and perfect mental health should be able to control their destiny and happiness because they don't have to fycking deal with petty emotions, but why isn't this the case for me?????

I have no friends, when I do make friends they're scared of me and stop talking to me because I overwhelm them by the way I talk and do things, so what I'm asking is, if I'm biologically evil and thus CANT EVEN EXPERIENCE REAL HUMAN EMOTIONS, why are these ""fake"" emotions running my life?????? I'm not happy, I don't understand the reasoning that my subconscious mind is using, because clearly it thinks that my behavior is somehow advantageous to me but I DONT FUCKING GET IT!!!!!! WHY CANT I STOP ACTING THIS WAY IF NONE OF IT IS EVEN FUCKING REAL?

I am beyond emotions, I am pure evil, and yet my subconscious for whatever reason insists on acting and pretending to have emotions THAT ARE NOT HELPING ME

How is it helpful at all for me to lay on the floor for three hours crying and scared that people are going to hurt me????

Like WHY am I faking crying for hours, especially when it serves no advantage to me and just hurts me?? Like I'm just alone in my room crying and won't tell anyone about this, so it's not even like I'm doing it for sympathy I don't think? God I wish I could just ask my subconscious brain its reasoning for doing this to me, because it really seems to think I'm somehow benefitting from this (if I wasn't benefitting from it somehow, it wouldn't be HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE I APPARENTLY CANNOT EXPERIENCE EMOTION)",19Apr2017,2

I was doing alright for a few years, considering my environment and different situations that presented themselves, but for the past few weeks my anxiety has gotten to the point where it's unbearable and I don't know where to turn.

She's been seeing a therapist for a while and is considering medication but is quite wary of the option and has some questions she'd like to ask the Reddit community. If you, or someone close to you, has had experience with mental health medication your input and knowledge would give her more confidence to make a decision. 

1. How long did the medications take to have some positive effects?

2. What are the side effects to SSRIs? I'm thinking Lexapro, Prozac, Zoloft, etc...those are SSIs that can help with anxiety, OCD and depression. Initially, the doctor was going to start me on Lexapro.

3. If you wanted to get off medication, how long did it take and what medication(s) did your doctor use to get you off and onto another?

4. Which medication have the least side effects? The best?",19Apr2017,3

62,"This whole week I have been so unmotivated and all I want to do is sleeeeeep! I don't know where this came from because my life has pretty great lately. I'll have periods of time I could be using to get a jump start on assignments and be time efficient but instead chose to just do something stupid like watch YouTube videos or tv. And I've been eating a lot more than usual. Also I love working out but just don't feel like it or don't want to do it. I want to want to work out but I just feel so out of it and lethargic.

I'm still able to get things done that need to get done it's just hard to find the motivation lately. Even when I'm at my part time job, cleaning up, I'm thinking ""why am I doing this? This is stupid and not worth the pay."" When my job isn't THAT bad considering the benefits.

Anyway, how do I get out of this slump? I don't feel like I have energy or motivation, and just want to stay in bed. What the heck is going on? How do I fix it???",19Apr2017,1
66,"The internet makes it easy to avoid responsibility for your actions. Whether its Reddit, facebook, twitter, tumblr or Instagram, all of these platforms are in no shortage of people to give you biased, one sided advice.

Do something shitty? No problem, its not your fault. Upset about something you did? Its okay, you should never be sad.

People in this day and age run away from sadness and disappointment in fear of being triggered, but without that sadness and disappointment, nothing will change

Maybe you need to be sad. A little triggering is good for you

Just because you're mentally ill doesn't mean you're exempt from the consequences of your actions. You are obligated to fix your shit. No one else is obligated to change their lives to cater to your sensitivities.

People are responsible for their own behaviors.

Example: if you get triggered its your responsibility to remove yourself from the situation instead of policing the actions of others.",19Apr2017,1
71,"I know myself I'm not 100% okay. I feel strange and off, have felt this way for some months now. I'm a bit of a mess, but I hide it well (I'm very adamant about keeping my feelings etc private) and  no one around me (friends etc) seem to think anythings wrong (They'll tell me I'm just overthinking etc etc). I also feel as though my therapist doesn't take me as seriously and trivialises a lot of things I say. Does this mean it's all in my head and it's not as bad as I think? ",19Apr2017,2
72,"How to I tell the difference between voices inside my head and outside my head?
I have my inner monologue voice but I also have this loud angry voice that is uncontrollable and demands I do what it says or it will cause my psychical pain, like my head is in a vice and each time I try and go against it, or reason with it, the vice gets tighter and tighter. it's destroying my life.",19Apr2017,1
