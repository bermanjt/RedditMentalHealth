1,"i'm a 20 year old woman in canada who has suffered extremely severe depression and anxiety my whole life. i first ""self harmed"" around age 9 when i would aggressively punch myself in the head or leg as form of self punishment. around 14/15 i thought of suicide and began cutting. i've semi run away from home once and regularly quit jobs and have declined school. in high school my doctor and therapist suggested i drop out as my mental health was that bad. i have an alcoholic father and a manipulative mother. i have no friends and recently went through an extremely painful breakup. my suicidal thoughts have come back at full force and much more constantly. i am either lazy and depressed, or full on hysterically wailing and screaming for hours as my brain tells me everything that's wrong with me and my loneliness and lack of future and the sheer need to not exist. i am hoping to see my doctor next week and potentially look at inpatient options. just looking for some experience on what inpatient life is like and how anyone has found it.

2,"Hello, how are you? Well, considering that this is a one sided conversation, I'll introduce myself.

Hi, I'm {Someone you don't know}. Currently, I am 13. Suprising? 

I really wish to know what you are thinking about at this moment, it must be so weird and confusing, and mostly amazing to be another person, another being with a functional brain and the ability to feel, and to love.

Here's the thing. I have noticed that other people are so very intresting. They can express themselves fully, with feelings. 

I feel as if my mind is... everything. It is blank, it is full of splitting emotions that make me cry out, it is full of voices that make me giggle, and want to write a book with myself.

I would name it, ""How to (not) exist.""

But enough about that, I have noticed many other things.
Humans... don't like to be analyzed.

For instance, I might say that the reason you would come and look at this site was because you might enjoy feeling special in the terms of ""No one else is like me, because I am psychotic and have many different ways of thinking. I am ever so unique.""

Maybe not.

Who really knows? After all, I'm not you.

I wonder if anyone will read this post.

That would be funny... to see the first and only time I express myself to others would be the time no one hears. 

Honestly? I may be just like you. (or) I may be an insufferable, damned little cheeky kid, who's only 13, and ""can't ever understand what I'm feeling,"" and that ""They are just a kid, just a stupid little kid.""

Who knows.

I look at others, and I see fire, fire everywhere, and blood rolling down. It makes me want to laugh, to smile an ear-splitting grin.
I also want their ears to split.

It would be great, and my hand twitches ever so slightly around my pencil, sharpened to the merest point, as if it was like a knife. 

Coincidentally, I have a knife in my-

But I also tend to look at things with a binoculars that is in reverse, so to speak. I also count how many ways I can kill someone, and how many ways my life would end, revolved around that little light, flickered out.

It would only take a breath.

Unless... it was a raging wildfire. Then it would consume everything, roaring and grinning and I would smile at it, before I was consumed by it as well.

Who knows what others are thinking.

Maybe we are all the same, dreaming and thinking of raging rivers of bones, of psychos, and the screams of a mother as she cradles her first-born child, his-

After all, I hear the statement, ""We are all psychos,"" far too many times.

I wonder what the comments will be like.

I might actually kill someone if they reply,""Same.""

Don't get me wrong, that was a joke. Feel free to laugh at it.

But you must understand as well, right?

Or I might be cazy.",25Aug2017,3
3,"Hi everyone, I'm a 23 yo male and I've been wondering lately about my mental health. Just as a recent background, I had a period during college  (which I graduated recently from) where I was suffering from rather severe depression. I was treated and came out of that ordeal in fairly optimistic fashion. However, I never felt like I reached a stable place even if I wanted to believe that I had. I happened to hear the symptoms of bpd, and it struck me that I might have this condition. 

There were a few male figures in my life which I've felt a certain kind of attachment to. Currently, it is my best friend at the moment (FYI we are also sexual partners, I don't know if that's pertinent). Like the other figures, I think of him in quite high terms at times, and I feel like being around him all day. I often try to adopt his attitude towards many situations. Even though I think it is silly, I get anxious at the notion that he might hang out with other people and not with me. It's definitely a separation anxiety. With this particular person, if I get the perceived impression that he slighted me or doesn't care about me, my mood is likely to switch quite quickly into a negative space. I'm likely to get emotional, but I try very hard to sound neutral as if the situation didn't affect me. I can be very bitter, resentful, and contemptuous towards this person, thinking that they have malevolent intentions towards me. My self-righteousness shoots up, and I harbor these emotions for a while until I start to begin to think a couple of things: the situation wasn't a big deal, it wasn't his fault, and that I want to hang out with him again.

I fear this will ruin the friendship. I do not easily make friends, even though I easily get along with people. I find myself quite insecure, though I do not have any way of comparing the degree of my insecurity to those of other people. I still get depressed; I feel empty, without energy, without motivation. However, I will have many points of happiness, though they do not occur as often. I have a tendency to rely on alcohol or marijuana, at times can cross into what feels like abuse. 

What do you all think? I don't know if I am exaggerating or if I should see a doctor. I have a comfortable job, comfortable living. But things don't seem to be right. I do genuinely feel like I cannot control my emotions. Thanks for reading and hope to get some feedback. Ask any questions and I will try my give the most honest answer.",25Aug2017,1
4,"So I have a younger brother with depression, he's not doing so good at the moment. I buy him a book every couple months (just an old tradition to keep him reading) and in light of him feeling particularly low, I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for a book to send to him? Something feel good, uplifting, positive about society. I'm not looking for self help books or anything like that. It's just everywhere you turn at the moment there's negatives and I'd like to give him something easy to read and light hearted to give him a bit of escape time before he goes to sleep. ",25Aug2017,1
5,"How do you trust therapists???

I've tried to go see 4 or 5 different therapists (only counting the ones that I've seen regularly) and still feel incredibly physically uncomfortable in the room with them-- the moment I walk in it's difficult to make eye contact, I feel like I physically can't say the words I want to say, and expressing any kind of emotion (even happiness or excitement) other than general sadness or defeat or whatever seems overwhelmingly difficult. My brain shuts down in a sense, and it feels hard to think or comprehend anything while I'm in that room.

I think it maybe this stems from my dad being incredibly passive-aggressively controlling, with random outbursts of anger about things that had been okay or didn't seem ""bad"" for months or even years. I constantly feel like my therapist is going to judge me, disapprove of me, think that I'm horrible, or worse, think I'm not actually doing that badly, and I'm just whiny-- and that they are just not telling me yet, and will bring it up at some random future point when I do trust them, and are therefore more vulnerable and less guarded. 

Today, even telling my therapist ""I found a new apartment that I'm really excited about, after months of searching, and I'm elated!"" felt sooo difficult! I just felt like, ""How would she use this against me"" and clammed right up, and felt like I couldn't even tell her this good news.

I'm fairly sure I have primarily social anxiety(/depression) which fuels an OCD-umbrella disorder (excoriation) and a few (very specific) OCD compulsions, although I have not received official diagnoses from any therapist; I have also never seen one therapist for more than a year at most, with most of them not more than three or four months-- I always waited until I was in crisis mode to try therapy again, instead of starting when I wasn't already feeling oversensitive about how poorly I was coping. The constant stopping/starting over probably isn't helping, but being a student with a poorly-staffed, high turnover mental health office makes continuity kind of difficult. I recently graduated so now I have to look for a new therapist again and I'm dreading it, but want to know what I can do in the meantime to not waste so much of my/their time.

Tl;dr, I know in my head that my therapist isn't judging me and that they've seen worse, etc., but how do I learn to trust and express myself genuinely to a therapist? When even when I want to, I find I just physically.. can't for some reason?

7,"Hi guys! I've never visited this subreddit before but I thought I would use it to ask a question. This is a diagnosis question, but not for myself or anyone I'm acquainted with anymore, I'm more just wondering about what you all think this could be mostly out of curiosity. 

So ten years ago, when I was 15, I went to summer camp as a junior counselor. There was a girl in our cabin who was very short and her eyes always looked sort of glazed over, and it was clear very quickly that there was something going on in her head that was beyond what the camp was prepared to handle. Sometimes she would be fine, but the second a situation got overwhelming she would lose it. Here are some of the things that happened while she was there:

-During music class (it was a musical theatre camp) she started saying ""I can't find where we are in the song!"" When I pointed it out to her on the page, she screamed ""I KNOW, SHUT UP!"" very loudly.

-Whenever we made a mistake during a dance number and we had to interrupt the song, she would crumple to the ground holding her head, and sometimes start screaming

-She had a friend at the camp that she mostly got along with, but when I was alone with her once she suddenly whispered to me, ""I hate her so much. I don't care about her at all. I wish I could stop pretending to care about her. I hate her"" and say wicked things like that. She also whispered ""stop it"" or ""shut up"" often to herself, and would clench her fists and grit her teeth

-If anyone got too close to her or touched her she would practically rip their head off. I distinctly remember not being able to leave on the bus once because someone sat next to her and she proceeded to scream at them until they were in tears, then we had to restrain her from punching them

-This happened twice and this was the worst, she attempted to throw herself out of a window of a building where the drop might not have killed her but it would've injured her badly. I'm so surprised they didn't send her home after this, people had to grab her and drag her back in

I've always wondered what she was possibly diagnosed with, because it was a complete shock to the camp that she had any mental disorder at all. I don't know if they talked to her parents at all after or during. But she sure made me super anxious, everyone was always on edge around her. I felt bad because it really seemed like she should not have been at that camp and should have been getting more help. But I always wondered what was going through her brain that made things so hard for her and always made her so angry, or at least come off that way?",25Aug2017,1

It bothered me so much I left the game this person was in, despite the 30min penalty I would receive. It bothered me so much I was thinking of responses in my head I could have said, it gave me a headache.

18,"Hi Everyone

I'm new to this whole online self help stuff and have now resorted to this as I'm feeling I'm at a point where I need a little advice/help.

Here we go - when I was a kid, I was physically abused by my father all the way through my senior year of college. Everything from being drowned, to severely hit, to broken bones. I have scars to this day which serve as a constant reminder. My father killed himself about 6 years ago and that seemed to have relieved me of a constant thought of what if this were to ever happen again to me.

Today, I'm a 40 year old male. Happily married with two kids. A professional in the biotech space. From the outside, I appear to be a pretty well put together guy. I'm friendly, an avid runner, talk to anyone and love to help people. I call myself a ""fixer."" On the inside, however, I'm a tortured soul I feel. My mind is freight train going 100 miles an hour for what feels to be 24 hours a day (let's say 4am in the morning knows most of my secrets and troubles :) ).

One of my largest challenges is being accepted. It's starting to consume me. A couple of years ago, I met a guy that I started running with and over time, he's become my closest friend and confident (outside of my wife). We run every weekend together and text everyday. I have never experienced such a close friendship before and I've developed a severe need for constant reassurance that everything is ok, we're still friends, he's not going anywhere, blah blah blah. I feel the same way with my wife -- essentially anyone I get close with. I hate the thought of anyone being upset or mad with me and it eats me up inside until I hear the words ""we're ok"" coming from the person's mouth.

I hate blaming these ""problems"" on my past childhood. I hate opening those doors again and can't stand the thought that I'm still being affected to this day by what happened to me. My ultimate fear is that I will drive people away with my constant worry and need for acceptance.

So my question simply is, how does one manage through these challenges?",25Aug2017,3
19,"I work night shifts in Sydney and although I have managed to joke about it until now, I have had some serious problems recently with dread and my anxiety before I start work. 

I start work at midnight and at around 9:30PM I start to get tired and remember that I have to stay awake. At 10:00PM, I want to rid myself of all ideas of work and make a lifelong commitment to sleep all day. It is by 10:30PM that I start thinking about plans to change my hours, or retire, and by 11:00PM, I am swearing in my head. 

However, and this is the interesting part, when I start work and get on the floor, I enjoy it. It is just when I am approaching work, when I realise that if I did not work, I would be asleep. 

I have not always been able to sleep after work either. I have a baby nephew I have to look after three days a week, two of which collide with work. He wakes up at 6:00AM, I finish at 4:00AM. I go bat shit crazy, but only for the couple of hours leading up to work, and if I am awake and looking after my nephew. 

I have thought of changing my hours, but there is no work to be moved, outside of late hours, and I cannot resign for at least six months, when I return to Uni.

I'd go home after work an 6pm on friday and just not go out or see or speak to a single other human being until Sunday--Monday if i didn't need to go into the lab or get groceries.

24,"Hello! This post was originally on r/relationships but I was asked to move it here. 

I knew my friend only casually for about a year before he moved
to a different town. Recently, we reconnected through social media. Our conversations were always fun and I never had any kind of problem with him until a few days ago.


Late at night, he messaged me saying that he was having thoughts of taking his own life. He's mentioned his depression before, but this time things felt really different. I tried my best to talk him out of it but he rejected every piece of advice I gave him. He talked about shooting himself in the head multiple times and I got really worried. After a few minutes, he said ""Goodbye."" and I assumed that meant he was going to kill himself. (He later claimed that he said that because he was done talking with me, not because he was going to shoot himself) I got really scared and told him that I am willing to call the police and tell them his address if he is actually going to try and hurt himself. Immediately after I said this, he got angry and told me that I betrayed his trust. He said that this proves that I'm a ""fake friend"" because I wanted to try and ruin his life. I tried to explain that I only said that because I care about him and I don't want him to die but he told me I was a liar. He then went into the groupchat that we were both in and announced to everyone that I was a liar and a fake person.
At this point I was really upset and confused because this is not what I intended to happen at all. When I tried to explain my intentions, he blocked me from all forms of social media. About 15 minutes later, he unblocked me and said ""Even though you are unblocked, I'm still EXTREMELY angry."" Even though I apologized multiple times, he still claimed I was a liar and that he hated me. It's been a few days and we haven't talked at all, which is strange because we used to talk every day.


My other friends say to move on because this guy is mentally unstable but I can't help thinking that this is all my fault. I really didn't mean to end the friendship. Did I react to his suicidal thoughts in the wrong way or is this his problem? I can't stop feeling guilty about what happened. Thanks for taking the time to read this!

25,"Recently, some guy from my hometown, maybe a few years behind me in school, committed suicide. We didn’t know each other, but the last name sounded familiar to me.

Suicide rates among men (especially white men, usually in middle age) are high. These rates are rising. According to the Center for Disease Control, [121 Americans](https://www.theovernight.org/?fuseaction=cms.page&amp;id=1034) take their life each day. [93 of those people are men](http://www.suicidology.org/Portals/14/docs/Resources/FactSheets/2015/2015datapgsv1.pdf?ver=2017-01-02-220151-870). Seven out of ten suicides are white men: sons, fathers, brothers, husbands, people. People just [like you and me.](https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/)
Why? Well, because men tend to (not always, but they tend to) use more lethal suicide methods like shooting themselves or hanging themselves. They tend not to seek help and, honestly, our society and culture does not urge men to seek help enough. In fact, our society and culture probably discourages men from seeking help.

We can blame the disappearing middle class, increased rates of stress, the high cost of education, reliance upon drugs, and any other aspect of our daily life. It’s all related and it’s all culpable.

I’m not going to tell you that asking for help is easy. It isn’t. And I’m not going to tell you that mental health stigma doesn’t exist. It does, and probably more so for men than for other people. I will tell you that there are resources. I will tell you that no matter your financial situation or how full your to-do list is, it’s always OK to take time for yourself. I will tell you that it’s understandable to not want to open up because you don’t want to be a burden on your friends and family. However, being physically and mentally healthy is one of the best gifts you can give yourself and your loved ones.

31,"hey guys! this is a bit long so please bear with me

this is the biggest problem of my life.
i live a fairly decent life and i am satisfied. my parents arent physically or verbally abusive, my bed is very comfortable and i have a cat. but what troubles me the most every day is this.

this has been a problem for me for 2-3 years now. i think i should mention ahead that i am a minor and also have arthritis, and have been on meds for it since i was diagnosed with it in 2015.

somewhere in 2014 or 2015, my mother had touched my tablet, and i hated the greasy feeling it left on the tablet. it's uncomfortable to my touch and i felt uneasy using it. and in december last year, i noticed how my mother didn't wash her hands after using the toilet, and it disgusted me, and since then it's been going downhill. Nowadays, i always wear a long-sleeved top garment outside my room and i use its sleeves to touch stuff my mother has touched because i dont want that greasy feeling on my hands. And I mean absolutely anything, including kitchenware, doorlinks and lightswitches, bedsheets even after theyve been washed by her, etc.

i think i could go on a day without ever washing my hands after touching stuff my moms touched. that includes doorlinks and i wont have to wear a long-sleeved shirt and open doors with my elbows and close with my wrists. the problem is the grease-feeling. i cant stop that. it makes me feel uncomfortable, whatever im doing, and it feels like it needs a good scrubbin to get off.
i think i should also mention that this sweat-feeling applies to other people as well, but it's not as bad as it is with my mother. for example, i got it from my grandpas headphones and my cousins' colouring pencils and toys, objects which my mother had not touched (i think). a long time ago i also got it from one of my classmatess sweaty hands in dance class, but i think other people would have been bothered by it as well. and it didnt make me freak out, just mildly annoyed.

it is irrational but it did not come out of nowhere, right? I've told a few therapists so far. one thought i had an autoimmune disease and set me on medication for it for 3 days and it didnt easen the ''symptoms'' like it was supposed to.  it didnt do anything. i wasted a week of my life in a (childrens) hospital because i wasnt taken seriously (by a childrens psychologist).
the most recent one thought i had aspergers or/and ocd and set me on meds as well. i dont think its gonna do shit. i really dont think this thing could be treated with meds. or at least, not by the meds for these illnesses that i doubt i have.
but one of the facts is that my mother's room is untidy, and it's unhygienic to not wash hands after using the toilet or taking out the trash and etc. if my therapists knew what i know about my mothers hygiene, theyd definitely agree that something isnt right. it doesnt immediately mean that my case is rational, but it most certainly would help them understand why i am like this.

it is a big dream of mine for my mother to significantly improve her hygiene, and for there to be a big cleaning in my house (removing that grease-feeling from objects she touched before she became more hygienic). it sounds ridiculous, and its a bit embarrassing for me to talk about this grease-feeling, but its such a comforting thought for me. i really want this to stop.
I told that to my recent therapist and he said i can't change a persons lifestyle, and i thought about it, and he's right. i feel bad for wanting to control my mother like that but im not doing it out of spite, or because i'm a narcissist, or hate her because teenagers hate their mothers, i'm doing it because if i dont, i will get very badly stressed out. i wish she knew that.

i had an argument with my mother about it today and she told me, that if i tell anyone about why i wash my hands so often (because shes unhygienic), shell tell them that i have autism. she says that shes ''defending herself''
i felt frustrated. not because i dont want to be known as autistic because i think people with autism dont deserve respect, but because my mother wants people to think that shes completely innocent in this. she knows that people wont like her once they find out how she lives. she cares more about her feelings than my health.

and i dont even think i have autism. i dont show any of the symptoms. i dont stim and arent sensitive to noise/touch/smell, i dont have the need for routine, i dont really have anything that im very passionate about for a long time and could go on hours talking about, etc. and ive never shown the symptoms before in my life either.
i think my therapist may have jumped to the conclusion because its genetic, and my mom really digs gardening, but thats about it when it comes to her symptoms. i dont understand why my therapist thinks im an aspie. i can imagine an aspie doing these things i do, and i dont mind the possibility of me being an aspie. i just dont think i have it because i dont show any of the symptoms. or, at least, its a rather mild case of it, or something like that. i guess, me being sensitive to that grease-feeling could be a symptom. its very specific though, and im not really sensitive to loud noises/smells/touch in general. my mothers coughing does bother me too though, but im too tired to write about that right now. 
but its possible, and i dont mind that. yet, this thing got actually bad less than a year ago, and a few years ago i wasnt like this. and if this sensitivity of mine to my mothers hands is permanent now, im not going to let myself live with it. im suffering. its taking a toll on my mental health.
in the second half of my last schoolyear, things were getting bad. i realised that my textbooks and workbooks had been touched by her when she put covers on them in september, and so, i would avoid touching the covers and the last page where she signed my name, and if i accidentally did, i immediately went to wash my hands with lots of soap and hot water, 3 times or more.
and today happened something that destroyed me a lot. i was supposed to get my new textbooks from my schools library today but i couldnt because i had rehab, so my mom delivered them home herself. i now have to go through that same experience until i get new 'books. when i think about it, i get just so frustrated, and angry, and sad, and i feel like tearing up again.
it's awful. ive thrown away 2 sponges and a keyboard immediately after i discovered that my mom had touched them. i also ruined the tablet i mentioned earlier by trying to clean it. and my laptops keyboard too. they dont work anymore.

i feel delusional. this isnt healthy. i dont think my mom and therapists realise how bad this is. i guess my therapists will start understanding me better over time, and that kinda comforting to know",25Aug2017,1

""Credit crunch"" hit and I lost my job, went a bit downhill myself and eventually my girlfriend left me for one of my ""mates"". Things were still going as well as they could considering but then she stopped me seeing my child for no reason to play happy families with her new man. This sent me a bit over the edge and that is where I started behaving out of character. It took 7 months to get to see my daughter again due to ex not turning up to court and messing around as much as she could in general. During this time i tried to take my own life twice and self-harmed on a few occasions, both things I'd never done before. Once I could see my daughter again for the next few years I kept getting on track for a while then something would happen (usually my own fault) and I'd be back to acting crazy. 

Fast forward a few years and I'm at another low point and was doing things I wouldn't normally do like having one-night stands etc. I ended up getting another girl pregnant and initially done everything i could. I was with a different girl and had moved 80 miles when i found out but immediately broke things off to move back to where the girl who was pregnant with my child lived and we tried to make a go of things but again i lost the plot and started acting completely crazy. She wouldn't talk to me and i couldn't face court again so never tried as hard as i could of (although it's something i regret). 

Between then and now I've been to the DR over different periods and it seems most likely that I have Bipolar disorder. I keep thinking I am managing it well then i end up doing something silly and setting myself back mentally. I am so close yet it always feels so far to getting myself back on track. I've given up smoking weed and taking other drugs though last week it was my 29th birthday and i ended up having a few drinks which ended in a week of partying and taking various other drugs which i am ashamed off after doing so well recently. I moved 2 months ago to a new country (still go back and visit my first daughter and keep in contact online). Before i had slipped up i had joined a gym, started volunteering, had been helping a mate suffering with his own mental health problems and felt like i was doing well. now i just feel like i'm destined to keep going round in circles, teasing myself into thinking i've got it back together then letting something happen that sends me back months. I thought i'd gotten over all this but i just feel caught in a continuous loop. I want to get somewhere in my life i can be proud of and face what i need to face. My oldest daughter is 10, we get on amazingly, it's only a matter of time before she sees through how well we get along and realises i'm no good. What do i do when it feels like no matter how hard i try i keep knocking myself back? ",25Aug2017,3
