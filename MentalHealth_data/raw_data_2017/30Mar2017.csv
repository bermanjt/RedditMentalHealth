0,"This is like third time in one week. I dreamed that my grandmother had an accident and I saw her cut in half (in the waist) and she was covered with blood and she was shouting at the men to kill her. Then I realized I was dreaming again and I started jumping in front of trains to wake up, started hitting things and that lasted for around 30 minutes. Then I started screaming (I don't know if I screamed in the reality too) but it didn't help and then I woke up (but then realized I wasn't woken up in my reality still - this becomes a habit lol), and then I started bending my body in half and I woke up. By the way at the end of the dream I realized I had someone who loves me (the girl I met yesterday) and that I have to get back to her...

Then when I finally woke up I went straight to the toilet, opened the door, and my grandmother was there sitting on the toiler chair - that scared me to death.",30Mar2017,1
1,"Backstory: USA. We had been dating for 7 months prior to us breaking up in January. The reasons were she was distraught over her prior ex which bled into our relationship and then she took a job in another state. I continued to keep in touch as a friend. We had an argument on Monday of some pictures I posted on facebook of her, and her alone, that I thought she wanted.  
So today I got a set of text messages from my ex which in conjunction to our previous talks led me to believe that she was going to kill herself. I ended up calling her landlord who didn't call me back and then ended up calling the police for help. 30 minutes after I got off the phone with police she called me completely hysterical and after 15 minutes was able to calm her down enough to understand what she was saying. Another 30 minutes went by and the police showed up.  
Based off of what she had texted me, what she told the landlord, and what she told the police themselves they made the decision to take her to the hospital. The last thing I heard on the phone before she hung up was the officer saying ""You can voluntarily check in or I can involuntarily check you in"" and then she hung up.  
At this point I am at a complete loss as to what to do. I know that right now she is at a hospital in her state. I hope she is at a minimum being cooperative. I am not sure if it is appropriate for me to figure out where she is and what I can ask about since I am not her legal family (Which all live in the UK as well) and if I should even attempt to talk to her.",30Mar2017,4
2,"First time poster in this thread! 

Soo I [21f] am a southern-hemispherian and I've noticed for the last 4-5 years that whenever the days get shorter and colder I ALWAYS become significantly more anxious and down. I have anxiety and have recently been put on escitalopram which have been an absolute life saver, but even now as the days start cooling down I can feel myself getting more anxious and hiding in my bed for safety because I just feel scared of the world. I'm also a self harmer and have recently celebrated 6months no self harming and I sooo do not want to ruin all my hard work, but I can just feel the itch coming back!! I also am so happy with this perfect relationship right now and I'm worried that if the old anxious, flat, scared, self-harming me comes back I might damage it. 

Does anyone else experience this? If so do you have any ideas of how to get rid of these feelings or better manage them ? I'm getting scared. Thanks in advance and everyone take care",30Mar2017,1
3,I have no motivation in life. I never manage to do anything to improve myself and when I try I just get complacent and give up very quickly. I am jealous of everybody and everything and I'm too lazy to actually make myself worthy of the respect of others. I seek attention and validation from others and I'm not even sure if I really believe that everything I just said is true or if I am just trying to get attention from you guys. I dont even know what I am asking from you guys but I needed to just say this. ,30Mar2017,2
5,I have lots of things that run through my mind all the time . But the problem is say I have an evening free and then I have to choice what I wish to do. And then I get really uncontrollably anxious trying to choice what to do and when I do decide what to do then I continue being anxious feeling as if I chosen the wrong thing. It makes my head spin in circles all the time. I'm trying to relax and I'm afraid I won't be able to relax choosing what I choice to relax with. Make sense? Any helpful advice?   ,30Mar2017,6
13,"Every since elementary school I've had terrible social anxiety, and in 5th grade (and most of middle school)  it sent me into a terrible depression which instilled the worst procrastination in me. I also had zero friends for most of 5th grade, was lethargic, and constantly fighting off tears. Somehow every single adult in my life chose to ignore this. 
 
Middle school was also pretty shitty for me, but the first two years of high school actually went pretty well. Now I might actually be at the lowest point in my life (it's tied with 5th grade), but my parents (mom specially) pretend like I don't have and have never had any problems with anxiety and like to lecture me on how I have nothing to be stressed about and how much worse adults have it (my mom also likes to talk about how she has the lowest stress job ever, so that doesn't even make sense). My mom also sometimes deliberately gives me anxiety attacks (which can last hours) when shes mad at me, and then she yells at me for having the attack. 

Lately it's been getting unbearable, and there's been times where I've had anxiety attacks at school (5 times in the past 2 months), so I've been looking into buying myself some medication to help me cope, like things for anxiety attacks and things to help me go out and be social and gave fun in situations where I want to have fun instead of hiding in the bathroom to cry the entire time. 

No matter how much research I do my friends hate the idea and honestly seem pretty condescending telling me to get ""real"" help, knowing that my parents would never allow it. Honestly, I'm not sure what else to do? My grades keep getting worse and worse, every year it gets harder and harder for me to focus and I can't even bring myself to care enough to do any assignments. I've had enough shitty grades that, even if I magically manage to improve them to straight As my last year, I still won't be able to get any scholarships and it feels like my entire future has been thrown away by my laziness and apathy. 

And the more I look back on how I was, the more pissed off I get that nobody tried to help me when it was so obvious. I hate who I am now as a person and I'd trade it for literally anything else, and if my parents didn't have the idea of mental illness so much I might actually have some self confidence and a future ahead of me.

15,"If there are some trainee student psychologists or psychiatrists that are willing to discuss my life with me and maybe help me with managing my stress, I would be thankful.

You can practice with me or use me as your experience in studies or whatever research you might be doing, in exchange for trying to help me get better. I am under a lot of stress lately, and many small problems that I encounter, I tend to think of worst possible scenarios, I overthink and get into panic.

I am a male in mid 20's, I have tried to look for online therapists but they are all paid. It is challenging finding someone who may actually understand my issues and how to fix them.

16,"Honestly, I never thought I would be the guy asking for advice online, especially about this...I'm 30 years old, living in the USA, and have recently had what I think are a series of panic/anxiety attacks.  The first one put me in the ER, thinking I was having a heart attack, but all the tests showed I was fine.

After speaking to a few people, including a nurse acquaintance , the general concusses was that I might be having anxiety issues.

The thing is, I have always felt stronger than that. I've weathered a shit ton of issues the past few years, with a smile and a joke. But lately I have had to drink myself numb just to be able to sleep without freaking out.

I know it is probably an easily fixed issue, but I find myself having a lot of trouble taking any steps to address it. I can't even bring myself to talk about what is happening to my family (and I am almost always 100% honest with them).

Not sure what I'm looking for here, but if anyone has felt the same, I would really appreciate hearing from you.",30Mar2017,2
20,"I have noticed a lot of people on here complaining that people in their lives don’t take their mental issues seriously.

Throughout my life, I have had similar issues with those closest to me struggling to understand or even believe the extent of my suffering. 

It was almost like my word (that I have a mental illness/issues from my past) was not believed on face value. Perhaps it was because I did my best to hide my symptoms and function as ‘normally’ as possible. In the past, I didn’t want any attention to be drawn to my condition.

This is a serious issue, as a lack of belief that someone is at risk could be potentially life threatening if some poignant signs are not noticed and addressed.

I was contemplating why people don’t believe that others have a mental illness, and came up with this post. I hope to help those with a mental illness see why others potentially don’t believe you, as well as help to reduce some of the stigma around mental illness as well.

Please let me know what you think.

24,"Pre-authorizations and utilization reviews are a core piece of the revenue cycle management processes in behavioral health billing. In this post we want to discuss items that will help obtain adequate authorization for patients within your behavioral health facility.

One of the key aspects of pre-authorizations and utilization reviews is having well rounded masters level clinicians trained specifically in these processes. Clinicians are not trained in their masters program to manage insurance in any shape way or form. Unfortunately, this puts the majority of clinicians at a disadvantage for obtaining adequate authorizations for patients. 

In order to assist with ensuring competency in your clinician you must have a specialized training program in place that will educate them on how to affectively obtain authorizations as well as continued stay reviews.

Have one of your clinicians dedicate time to reviewing and understanding patient placement criteria among the different insurance payers is a must. Keep in mind not all insurance carriers utilize ASAM placement criteria. You must familiarize yourself with the criteria and make sure you know the requirements prior to attempting to obtain authorization. 

The most overlooked requirement in the authorization and utilization review process in behavioral health is the documentation. Many authorizations are done over the phone with the clinician treating the patient making the call to the insurance carrier and describing medical necessity to the care manager. You must document your patients case in great detail in order to provide a comprehensive picture that defines medical necessity for the specific patient. Without having adequate documentation you may be placed in a position in which you do not receive compensation for services or potentially receive more authorization denials lacking information. 

This includes documenting detailed clinical and medical notes in the patients record. Insurance company care managers have a job to do with ensuring the patient in fact needs the level of care that is being proposed. If you do not have adequate information to build a case showing medical necessity you will experience and increase in authorization denials as well as claim denials after authorization is obtained. 

Education and documentation are among the most problematic pieces to authorizing patients. Create proper policies and procedures within your behavioral health billing organization surrounding education and effective documentation.

28,"Hi I'm a 22 year old guy. I don't know if I have a problem, because I don't like talking to people or being looked at, I feel very very nervous when this happens. And there are times that I feel down / depressed like it just hits you. And there's also a feeling of wanting to be alone. I'm afraid of crossing the street it makes me feel like when I turn my head on the other side a car would hit me from where I'm not looking. there are many times that I want to talk about this to my friends but I don't think that they'll be able to help I feel like they'll just going to make fun of me. 

Edit: when I was young I got bullied at school. I'm afraid of losing friends and when my friends didn't talk to me for a day or two I feel like I did something wrong. I don't like people not trusting me. Am I just being paranoid? is it bad?

29,"A few months ago, I took a new job, but it has turned out to be extremely boring. The tedium has shot my productivity because, instead of focusing on the work, the challenge has been pushing myself over that boredom hump, where the mind has slowed and thickened like molasses. I've stopped caring at an emotional level about whether I'm jeopardizing my job by distracting myself with just about anything else, and the distraction has won out over time spent on work. I feel agitated and hostile when I'm trying to focus on work, that it's an unwanted imposition on me. What's at stake is a high salary and my professional reputation.

I'm actively seeking a new job that's a better fit, but financially I'd rather not have an income gap until then. I figure I might just have to take a small hit to my professional reputation but write it off as a mismatch of expectations.

In the mean time, to try to cope with the boredom, I listen to music at work, which isn't enough to get me to focus, and work out and socialize after work. I could also spend some of the work day learning things that would have higher career value and are more interesting although this is technically time fraud. I do feel, however, they lied to me about what my responsibilities would be and how much time would be spent on bureaucratic stuff, so maybe fair is fair.

37,"Hey guys! Excuse me if this isn't the place to ask about this. I'm in the process of getting into making a short film about eating disorders and body dysmorphia. It's being adapted based on the thesis I wrote last semester about the steroid user community, and in my research I ended up focusing a lot on the mental health aspect of using those compounds.  Namely body dysmorphia and how it effects these guys and how they perceive themselves. It really resonated with me because I was able to tie in my own problems with anorexia which I developed at a young teen and my struggles with binging now.  I felt like I needed to write this screenplay to properly show that mental anguish. 

I'm meeting with a small and new production company within the next few days and they're interested in reading my script and going over it. I'm hoping to have it storyboarded by then. If all goes well, I truly think they would buy into my vision because I feel like I have a strong grasp on how I want this thing made. I know if it's made with the resources needed that it's gonna be accepted in festivals and even win them.  Now, I'm not sure how budgeting is going to go. I may get some lump of money for them to produce it, but I may also need more on my end. I'm currently raising money through selling things I make to help with that and I'm going to try to allocate what money I make into it too.  However, I do feel like something like a gofundme type dealio could really ease any doubts me or the company I'm working with may have on it. Would there be interest in this whatsoever? Not from this community here on Reddit specifically, but in any circles where people may suffer from some mental or eating disorders.  I may be able to pitch that to the producers as well for them to be even more on board with helping me. ai appreciate any advice y'all have!",30Mar2017,6
39,"So recently I(18m)have been talking to a friend of mine again, we were friends as children/teenagers. Now we're 18m 19f respectively and things have a different tone which is great. We're supposed to be meeting soon. 

Except, tonight she wasn't back from work at her usual time, so I start to get paranoid and I sent her only like 3 PMs, now see I thought yep fucking her ex. I mean when we were younger she used to have boyfriend after boyfriend, and she let me down a lot, with her unstable mood, unpredictability... I don't mean this callously, we both have our problems... For the most part we work great together, we're healthily codependent. She has improved so much though more than me, everything now proves to me that I should trust her, except I revert back, reversion is something she is strong enough not to do.

Turns out she was stuck in traffic for 1hr and a half. We know each other very well, she knew why I felt paranoid, I could feel the fury in the tone. So currently I have left her alone, appologised with equal intensity to her anger. I'll see if we can discuss it rationally a couple of hours later, we are good at that.

I got so stressed I feel like my entire personality has changed I need to stop this, for her. It always shifts between extreme sincerity to the opposite, as a coping mechanism, I have to keep being me. I keep hearing the distant sound of a child crying in the back of my head, is that me? My emotions are a mess, I'm a mess still, I keep trying to convince myself I have changed but I haven't really, I'm never going to feel happy.

I also can't shake the feeling that I'm misleading her about who I am, I'm sadistic, she knows, she knows how intense it is, she knows about my past, she knows how dark my personality can be, yet she trusts me, she enables me to an extent. She's pretty wonderful haha, she shares a similar sentiment about me too, I try my best to look out for her and we're a couple of ridiculously empathetic people who pick up on far too much for our good. Sometimes it clouds our judgements makes things blurry.

I think we are far too intense we burn ourselves out before anything can happen usually.

Just what do I do? how do I stop my mental health problems from letting her down, I promised her I can deal with the paranoid/controlling urges, she trusted me so why can't I trust her? I want things to work between us whatever happens. It's early days but I noticed I am trying to consume alcohol whenever I can without arousing suspicion, constantly  wondering why should I care about her?! Just want to run away and disappear or do stupid stuff. Fuck I love her and I feel so uncertain.

EDIT: We talked (talking) I have my warm fuzzy feeling back, I think I can keep myself going. Plus she's cool, she has an organic brain problem migraines other related issues, so I mean she got lost panicked her brain scrambled itself, so did mine in a different way, shes back, feeling better. I feel a mood swing coming on.",30Mar2017,1
41,"So my personality changes quite a bit. if I was describe a mode I am in right now, it is extrovert mode, it's hard to explain. But this isn't my usual personality, I am actually very introverted, quiet ( actually I am a manic depressive and can hit pretty severe lows usually), usually I would not have the mindset to post anything like this. My personality changes so much and even though I am visibly very different (Such as today people have quite literally asked what is wrong with me) unlike MPD I am always aware of these personality changes. I have always indenitifed it as masks. I want to see a psychiatrist for long standing problems with these issues and some other personal issues with have (I should have done multiple times in the past, but I have had a pretty shitty past for when iit comes to getting help). I am only really hitting the surface of what I usually go through usually with these issues, there's alot more but I am really not in the mind set to go into the darker details of it. I cannot control these personality changes when I go through them and I have quite a few which I indetify with. Like I said I am not sure if this is MPD because people with MPD usually go through amneisa with their identity swaps. I don't know, I want to know if anybody can give me any idea of what this actually is?  Like I said I am going through quite a big swap right now, like this is the most apparent one of my personality changes have been in a while. Maybe you'll notice later if I go back to normal that I come across as a little different. As I said I am aware of these personality swaps, I just can't control them, if that makes sense at all?   

So yeah if people can give me any clue of what is going on, much would be apreciated. If not for me, then maybe for others going through similar issues. there's very little online on this matter and I think having a reddit to explore and explain this sort of stuff more would be very valuable to those who need help on the matter.
