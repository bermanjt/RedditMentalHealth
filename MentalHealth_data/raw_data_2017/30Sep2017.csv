0,"My brain will suddenly ""NOPE!"" out on me when I read something or try figure out a problem, as though I'm trying to visualise the entirety of infinity. I swear, I will read something new and my brain just stops, almost like a computer lagging when scrolling.
All I can think of after it happens is, ""Why was it so hard to think of that?""",30Sep2017,1
2,"Hi. So I'm sick with sinusitis  (can't believe that's a real term). I vomited twice this morning, and whenever I get sick like this the panic attack lasts constantly. If I try to sleep, I'll be almost there and suddenly jolted awake by random dread only to feel even sicker. I was taking sertraline, 150 mg, but I don't currently have a primary care doctor so I've been taking half pills  (50 mg) once every couple of days. I have type 1 diabetes also, I take novolog and am supposed to be taking a long acting insulin too but my lazy ass has neglected it for the time being... all Ive eaten today is a can of mandarins.

Anyway, when I get like this I tend to feel even sicker around what I love. For example- my fiance. I haven't been like this since october 2015 when I first started birth control (which I no longer have, been off since july) I know I don't have a problem at all with him, but when I'm like this being around him only makes the panic worse (this morning when I finally puked, after feeling sick for awhile, was after I talked to him). Or things I'm into- currently it's Voltron- make me feel worse to think about for no damn reason. Voltron is always on my mind to the point where it's kinda my ""default"" thought, but right now whenever my thoughts fall back on it I panic more. I haven't been able to sleep, I've gotten maybe 2 hours total since 11 last night.

Sorry for rambling. I really am at my wit's end here.",30Sep2017,1
3,I am bipolar and I love lamictal. I feel great on this drug. My psychiatrist upped my dose and around the same time I am noticing my breasts are very swollen and tender. I also have pain in my nipples. My breasts have also gotten larger since Iâ€™ve been on this drug. Any one else notice breast changes on lamictal?,30Sep2017,2

7,"A couple of friends of mine were watching videos of people being tortured the other day while we were hanging out. I watched parts of them although I know I shouldn't have. 

The videos were of people being captured and tortured to death. They were extremely graphic, showing their limbs and heads getting cut off, throats being slit time and time again, and even getting the skin ripped off their face. Like I said, they were extremely graphic. They also had the volume up, and you could hear the people struggling for one more breath. 

Ever since I seen these videos, I've been really messed up. I try not to think about them but they keep popping up in my head. I have a history of depression but I've gotten a lot better in the past two years. It's really hard for me to cope over this. I can't believe stuff like that has actually happened. 

Whenever these videos pop back into my mind, I feel really empty and lost. I also have physical symptoms. I feel very nauseous and my chest starts burning on the inside and it feels a little harder to breathe. 

How can I get over this? I know it doesn't compare to actually being there and seeing this kind of stuff happen in person, but I feel scarred after seeing these videos. Any advice?? ",30Sep2017,14
8,"*I would like to preface, I have never hit a person or yelled or screamed. It's only expressed internally or as passive aggression.*

Background info: I work 2 jobs and go to college full time as a high school student, I am also in voc rehab for my (severe) ADHD, and am also diagnosed with major depressive disorder (although that went into remission a year or so ago) and social anxiety disorder (although I've basically beat that too). My mother is diagnosed bipolar and is very much a helicopter mom with a strong tendency to grandiosity and (maybe) narcissism. I am also extremely introverted to the point of (attempted )reclusion.

With that out of the way, everything in my life bothers me. How clingy my girlfriend is bothers me. She is a very unadjusted person due to how abusive her family is and clings on to me like a sloth. That being said she is a wonderful person and doesn't deserve someone like me who feels primarily annoyance at her love. 

I have a very active and close circle of friends (including my girlfriend) and they constantly force me to alter my plans to accommodate for them, but as an introvert socializing drains me, and whenever they want me to spend time with them, I just feel exhausted and annoyed afterwards. I feel awful though knowing how much they care and accommodate for my eccentricities and they are some of the most loyal and good-hearted people I know.

My ADHD is a critical factor in influencing everything I do on my own. I totally and utterly lack internal motivation and am barely able to do my schoolwork much less all the other things I want to do. Doing anything involves a session of mental gymnastics where the part of me that knows what my responsibilities are has to battle with the part of me only concerned with instant gratification and distraction. 99/100 times, the latter part of me is the part that wins. I am extremely intelligent (no r/iamverysmart please, I promise I'm not trying to brag) and this knowledge has been drilled into me since I was 7 as well as ""my potential"" (according to what my parents and teachers throughout the years) but both of these haunt me every day when I look into the mirror and see what I have accomplished, or more accurately, haven't accomplished. I have extremely high ambitions for myself, such as learning the guitar and becoming a musician, becoming an artist, a writer, getting into shape, getting into the best schools, etc. and all simultaneously (I want to do everything I can, like Leonardo da Vinci) but my crippling ADHD prevents me from putting in effort into anything I want to do. It feels like a sick joke. These are things I want desperately to do but my body just doesn't obey. Therefore I am disappointed and angry in myself and feel like a failure, which just decreases my motivation, which makes me even more angry and disappointed, ad nauseum.

Reading what I write makes me realize how stupid I am, and I feel like it to. I need to treat my girlfriend better. I need to stop pushing away my friends. I need to get off my lazy ass and stop disappointing myself. Simple and intuitive solutions, but I can't seem to stop digging myself into a deeper hole of self-destructive actions and emotions. Anyone with severe ADHD knows the feeling of knowing exactly what your problems are, but feeling totally paralyzed when it comes to taking action to fix them.

Sometimes I will get a surge of inspiration and I will start to do something productive. I invariably leave it unfinished and feel terrible because not doing something to completion is worse than never starting it into the first place. Sometimes I will think to myself, tomorrow is the day this all changes. I will have a solid idea of exactly what I want to do and will do. Invariably, my mom, my friends, my girlfriend, or my own incompetence will throw off the plan. I become extremely upset with myself if everything doesn't go the way I want it to or I don't do everything I wanted to. I realize that this is misguided perfectionism but I cannot help that I feel this way. Perfectionism has been drilled into me since I was a kid.

Whenever I get angry, it just feels like a droning in my brain. Not particularly intense, but ever-present. It drives me crazy. I close in on myself and hyper-focus on whatever it is that's bothering me and think about exploding or destroying something physically, but outwardly I just become essentially unresponsive, passive aggressive only if someone notices and tries to force a reaction out of me.

When the anger passes it just leaves a void of nothingness. I realize what an unreasonable and ungrateful idiot I have been and just sink into a numbness where I will stare at a wall or ceiling for hours at a time doing nothing else. I will often feel like crying and just ruminate on how dissatisfied I am with myself and everything.

I realize I probably sound like a shitty person with anger issues but any feedback would be extremely appreciated.",30Sep2017,3
9,"I work in an open office. The guy next to me talks in an increasingly loud voice the longer he's on the phone. Sometimes it's just cacophonous in general here. It's starting to really set me off.

I see a connection between my reaction to this, and my reaction to my mother in law when I was living at her place: when she was nearby, I just KNEW that she was going to come demand my attention in some stupid way, and when she did I'd get an adrenaline surge. 

Of course I get away from all of this as much as possible. I set up an office in my room in the house and eventually moved out, and when I can I use a quiet meeting room at work.

I want to get at the base cause of this though. What can I do to reverse it?",30Sep2017,2
10,"I'm going be short and to the point. I have had very bad hypochondria for a long time. I've been obsessing over my health for 10 years at least. It's gotten so bad that when I think about certain mental disorders such as OCD or Tourettes, I will temporarily experience some of the symptoms like involuntary tics etc. but they subside when I am no longer thinking of them. The only remaining OCD symptom I seem to have most of the time is the fear that I might lose control of my body and harm someone or something (like a pet). It's definitely effecting my life to the point where I avoid social situations where another person might be in a vulnerable situation. Ironically, social situations seem to reduce my symptoms as they give my brain something to do other than worry but I still feel the need to cut them out. I need help, I'm not sure what to do, please give advice. I cannot speak to a medical professional because I am a minor and my parents do not believe I have anything but hypochondria but almost jokingly as it's very common on my dad's side (not officially diagnosed).",30Sep2017,1
11,"I feel that they think I am weird, or I am stupid, or I am ugly. I feel like they hate me. Maybe the people I know don't, but I can feel the eyes on me when I am in public. They think I am crazy. They think they are better than me. I take risperidone and prozac regularly as my therapist told me to. I don't feel the effect. When I think to myself that is not what they think, I feel like I am lying to myself in order to be happy. I sometimes just get agressive. Never physically, but verbally. I tried getting help, but I don't see the effect.

12,"I'm just gonna get straight to this before I change my mind. I'm bipolar and I cant talk to people about it when I have a problem. I don't want to burden those close to me or drive them off and I am worried my doctors will send me back to the ward(I have a huge phobia of hospitals). I haven't really opened up to anyone in years. I'm honest about my illness but I cant talk about the symptoms and I have other issues that I cant express. I have built up such a mental block about talking to people that my throat seizes up and I completely withdraw into myself when I try to talk about it. That's why I'm writing this. I have to get it out because its gotten to be too much. I hate myself. I hate everything about myself. I feel weak and broken and that I have failed at everything in my life. I've tried so hard to make my life work but I keep ending up back in the same situation. I cant say I'm alone, I have friends and family but I always feel like if I let out the things that are eating me they will all disappear. So that's what I've done just held it all in. I want to let it out but it's so overwhelming now and I still cant around people. I'm starting to have urges to hurt myself again. I just don't know what to do. I'm so tired of fighting it.

18,"I would really like to talk more in depth about this with a person but I don't have any options right now. If any of you know what a healthy family looks like and would like to talk then PM me. 

But, basically, this is what my family was like (I know it's not *good*, but how abnormal/severe was all of this stuff?)

* House was always filthy, would go months without any cleaning, many areas years (think thick buildup of dust and pet debris)

* Single mom (dad has never been in picture ever at any point)

* 99% of our relationship has been some form of ""hello/goodbye"". We occasionally have small talk about politics, but it's very brief and we kind of just say ""did you hear..."" ""yeah..."". So, like, how bad is it for a parent to never ask a child questions or punish them or ask how they're doing or how their day was or what they like or.... anything really. She doesn't know me at all and has never shown any interest.

* She has a lot of issues from being molested as a small child by a relative, being a former alcoholic, and also having a neglectful childhood.

* She has either been at work or on the internet the entire time I've ever known her. That's just about literally it. Very rarely she ""does something"". She's probably ""done"" less than 50 things in the 25 years I've known her. Like, going to a book club or something. 

* She never punished me no matter what I did. Just never really paid attention to me. 

* It's like I grew up without a parent almost. Like until I was about 11 we would eat together as a family like macaroni and cheese or something cheap. We were very poor, I don't hold that against her, but then she basically just stocked the kitchen with pop tarts and frozen dinners and thats it for the rest of my life. Cooked a few times for holidays but that's it.

I just want to know how messed up I should be, because I'm pretty messed up. But nobody seems to get it because my mom acts so normal out of the house. 

Edit: I don't know how I made this an announcement...",30Sep2017,1
19,"A little bit of background: I'm in my thirties. My boyfriend, who I still love a lot, broke up with me not quite 2 months ago. I'm having problems to cope and accept. One of our main problems was a woman, let's call her X. They used to be FWB, but she thought it was a relationship. 
Anyway, we got together, they were over, but she kept influencing our lives, which he didn't want to see or didn't mind but I always had problems with this and he never wanted to understand those problems.

Anyway, fast forward to now, broken up. I was out with friends, everything alright. I'm still pretty quiet and sad due to the breakup. I came home, checked my social media and it hit me! X was in the same area my ex wanted to go for the weekend. ""X is feeling fantastic.... yes, a little bit romantic"" and stuff like that. 

I imagined, without knowing, them going there together, having FWB/relationship weekend. I wound myself up pretty badly, I couldn't sleep, cried, got up again, went restless through the apartment, just to lay down again, tossing and crying and feeling helpless and hurt. This went the whole night. I felt my heart beating pretty heavy, a headache started probably due to the crying. All was just wrong! I thought how to kill myself, who to leave a note, when to do it so nobody finds me too early, what to write to him and X, how to make sure, that nobody I love finds me. And now, after the night in bed, no sleep, I'm still crying and feel like shit and cannot control the crying!! 

Is this a panic attack? Anxiety attack? Just sadness? How can I make it stop??? I don't want to feel that anymore!! ",30Sep2017,2
20,"I've done it. I've hit my wall. I'm now laying with my head at the foot of the bed bawling my eyes out because I'm so beyond tired, and stressed I don't want to even lay next to my spouse. I have officially been up for 25.5 hours and counting. I woke up at around 1:30-1:40 yesterday morning and midnight the night before, and midnight the day before that. It's been an amazing pattern that has just engrossed me at this point. I have been so consumed by the stress of job hunting, moving, and trying to do normal day to day things it's literally sent me into a mental break down. I feel like I'm a toddler just weeping wanting to be compressed and hugged, but the thought of physical contact only makes me panic more and makes my skin crawl. So I sit here. Whimpering as quietly as I can cause I don't want to wake my spouse up again because I can't seem to get a grasp on my emotions because I am so damn tired, and we were arguing about his job and his want to look and how it stresses me out because I am NO bread winner by any means I feel like I've failed so hard that I can't even begin to support him financially the way he has me, on top of moving him away from his whole family, and friends, to a state we both don't know. Meanwhile all the while attempting to have a baby, taking pills that make me even more of a mess than I normally am, feeling like I'm sabotaging myself because I keep forgetting my pcos medications, and just cannot wrap myself around this again and again feeling like a broken person and human that I can't even do the one thing that all women are supposed to do correctly, and that just kills me further and further. I feel like such incredible failure, I'm literally mad at this point because my husband can actually sleep. What I'm up. My brain won't shut off, I can't even smoke, or take antianxiety meds because they're not good to take while attempting to have a baby. I literally think about it every day. Just getting in the car and driving away. Not telling anyone where I'm going, driving till my gas runs out hopping on a bus after bus and hoping that I just disappear. I haven't felt like this in a long time. I think since I went to college last year did I feel like this. Just a pathetic whiny waste of space. I'm a terrible person I know. I'm selfish and immature, greedy, irritating, obnoxious. I rely so much on my husband, my parents, and friends for emotional, and financial support. I'm the actual worst human ever. I'm done. I just wish I could sleepâ€¦ but I probably won't because I just cried and now I'm just numb to the idea.

21,"In my life I've come across many characters that made me feel depressed (I am having therapy under a psychologist for major depression disorder) 


I believe fictional characters are real they don't usually exist in our world BUT people's encounters suggest that things like mythical beasts (dragons, sea dragons, unicorns, elves) and fictional characters can temporarily cross over and interact with our world which is evidence they are real and can think for themselves as individual people as well. 


It really pains me when the creators give them (the characters) awful lives. For example this character from an old show's mom died and his dad abused him throughout his childhood, and as an adult he shows PTSD symptoms which is an awful thing to go through and the other characters are oblivious to it. The character also tries to kill himself at least once in the show. Since the show stopped I'm wondering if that character probably did end up killing himself and is now dead because the creator just forgot about him. 


I wonder if he feels hateful towards his creator for giving him and awful backstory like that. It was clear he hadn't gotten over it and a lot of the time people like that commit suicide. I just feel awful about it and that includes other characters who have to go through this. 


I'd really like to know how I could perhaps (try) and contact them, to let them know someone cares and they have someone sympathetic to talk to them so they don't feel all depressed and alone. ",30Sep2017,2
23,"My friend and I are developing a podcast right now. 

We both live with mental illness and we want to lend our own voices and stories to give it a voice. We would also love to hear from you. We are looking for anyone who would want to share their own life stories and experiences. It would be a frank conversation, and if you'd like to prefer anonymous that would be okay too. 

Sure, there are many outlets out there trying to spread awareness. We just want to do our part in adding to this, the more voices and stories heard, the closer we get to breaking stigmas and increasing understanding to those who may not have a clue what our lives are like. 

It would be interesting to also see what parallels and similarities there are in our community of sorts. As many conversations I've had with others like us, there have been multiples times that we both laugh or sigh in recognition. 

If you would like to be in an episode and open up to us, and to other listeners, it would be very welcome and appreciated. 

I know it may sound scary to some, and that's understandable, but for those of you who are sick of holding it all in and dealing with others who just don't get it, and want to have an outlet. Please hit me up. 

Each person would get their own episode. 

This would neither be exploitative or mocking the subject. While I tend to have a dark sense of humor when it comes to my own issues, it would still be a supportive and respectful environment.

We are still in development right now, but I'd make a list of everyone who sends me a pm and would keep you posted.

24,"I'm confused as to what might be my problem. I suspect it might be depression, but I'm not always upset, tired, or isolated from others. Sometimes I could be a little hyper or bored, but mostly bored. The boredom/empty feeling is what mostly concerns me though. When I get like this, I get extremely bored to the point where I might look for things to get high/drunk off of in the house, cut or burn myself,  and sometimes I get the urge to steal and  vandalize things. I get the urge to steal/vandalize, but I haven't done anything like that yet (thank god).  

A lot of the time, I'll have thoughts like ""nobody likes me"", "" I'm irritating to everyone including my family"", ""If I killed myself, everyone would be happier"", and ""everything is my fault"". My mom and friends of mine have told me that that isn't true and that I don't bother them at all, but for some reason I don't want to believe them or I think they're lying even though they're telling me I don't. 

I also feel like everything wrong in my life and my family's lives is my fault and it hurts me. I think I'm the source of their suffering. I blame myself for my dad dying (he committed suicide), my brother being sick, and my mother's drinking problem. These things seem like they're caused by things that are far beyond my control, but I still find ways to blame myself. 

I think about suicide daily. I doubt that I'll do it thought. I can always visualize my death in different ways in my head. The thoughts are always there. Even when I'm ok and hyper. 

I have no hobbies or interests. I used to draw, but I thought I wasn't good enough and lost interest. I either have no interest in anything or I'll find interest in things for only a short period of time then lose it. It's pretty hard for me to find interest in anything. 

I'm pretty lazy. I don't want to do work at school as much. My grades are going down due to this. I sometimes don't brush my hair, shave my legs, or do laundry for a while. I will do it eventually. 


Sometimes I get very lonely, but at the same time I isolate myself from other people. People I know get bothered by this, but I can't really help it. 

I apologize for the poor writing and long explanation, but I feel that if I don't explain everything, it will be hard for some to come up with an explanation for why I am the way I am. 

Thank you.

28,"Ill give the most recent example of talking to myself. I just spent like 20-30 minutes just pacing and mumbling the same three conversations about a show I like. I feel like this could be because Im constantly alone? Anyway, I keep imagining myself dying in weird ways. Like, really weird ways. And they're weirdly detailed but there's almost never any blood. For example, one of them was that I cut off one of my breasts with scissors and then fell onto my kitchen floor and died. There was also one where I laid my head onto a table and stuck out my tongue. The entire room was white, the table was white, everything was except for me and a person in a labcoat beside me. This all happened before the person (I couldnt see their face.) chopped off my tongue with a meat cleaver. I also have nightmares, the most recent one being about maggots. Somehow they crawled into my eyes and nose and started making new ones. Before I woke up, in my dream I went to a mirror. I dont know how I could see, but I did. There were hundreds of thousands of maggots pouring out of my eyesockets, moving quickly. I couldnt feel them at all I could only see them before I woke up and cried for about thirty minutes.

There is also times when Im alone where I get so scared that I feel like Im going to cry. I feel like Im being watched. Im scared of the darkness and I hate having to be alone. I dont feel safe in my own home anymore, Im constantly looking over my shoulder and I cant figure out why.

32,"This has me really worried. I produce art for a company and over the years my style has become addicted to vibrant colors. For example, the color yellow isn't just yellow, it has shades of purple and red in its shading, blue has indigo and grape purple shading, and so on. All the colors are almost or are 100% color saturated, which means it's the highest electromagnetic radiation being given out. The whole painting at the end ends up being very 'vivid' and 'colorful' and it has become a hallmark of my style. Pretty much every color is used and 'blended' into one another, and people tell me it's like they're looking into a rainbow when they see my paintings.

However I know that color is a form of electromagnetic **radiation** and by producing highly vivid, saturated images, my computer screen is projecting more intense radiation towards me. I am also very pale, so I feel this puts me at higher risk of radiation damage since I also get burned by the sun very easily and it takes a long time for my skin to recover afterwards.


I have a family history of cancer and I want to prevent cancer as best as I can, but at the same time my job keeps requesting I produce these extremely colorful images, which is subjecting me to different frequencies of radiation at very high strengths. Canceresearch site says electromagnetic radiation much less powerful than this are carcinogenic so I'm wondering if I should give up my job as an artist for my health and safety. The same time I've been working for this graphics job, I notice I feel more irritated and upset so I'm wondering if being exposed to EM radiation is doing harm to my mind. 

Here's a graph which shows that colors are part of the Electromagnetic Radiation Spectrum https://cdn.miniphysics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/electromagneticspectrum.jpg

34,"This might be a long post but I need to put it all out there to see if I can get any advice.. so here's the run down. 

I'm 17 years old. Healthy physically for the most part aside from being diabetic, struggling with weight loss (more on that later, but I recently was down to 95 pounds) and just random aches and pains. I struggle mostly with more mental issues. At least that's what I would call them, I've never really had anyone to educate me or help me through these mental problems. I recently hit a tipping point of something and went off the deep end. Ever since I was kid I was always pretty awkward socially and kind of had a random way my brain works. My behavior was always a little off, but I also had another side that was very open and happy so no one really caught on to my issues. My freshman/sophomore years of HS I went through a lot of depression and mostly kept to myself. At the same time I started showing a lot of anger at random times. Most people just wrote it off cause I would go back to happy within time or just ignored it. I've never really been able to communicate how my ""brain works"" but it is hard. A lot of times I feel like my own mind is both a prison and the biggest open field full of freedom. Total opposites. Throughout HS the anger got worse, but it came on randomly and I can't control it. It feels like I'm the Hulk or something. I go one minute being my social, happy, hippie self to the angriest person you've seen. It physically hurts me so much I usually have to hit something or do something physically. I've hurt myself and objects around me multiple times. It scares me. It started as big physical bursts of this anger, but for the past year my mind has seemed to go down the rabbit hole.. I went to a therapist for some time but I can't really communicate well so I couldn't really get it all through and ended up not going back. My concentration and memory has also been going to trash the past year. This makes me so scared... as someone who taught themselves to code at a younger age and now can't even think through a simple program.. it feels like my mind has slipped me. I go through weeks of pure happiness, like in August. I got set on starting up my own business and start making money. I felt unstoppable. Then a small thing happened in my life and I went downhill. Then that downhill ended up having my long term girlfriend break up with me. She was my biggest support. So now I feel like I have no one. My mother tries to help, and she does with getting me food (again on the food, I go through periods where I'll basically starve myself.) and trying to get my into doctors but emotionally she can't support me at all. So the breakup from my GF set me into a weird spiral of depression but also this ego filled period as well. It kept fighting back and forth and I hit the tipping point a few days ago. I've had the worst headache I've ever felt for the past three days. Nothing is making me feel any sense of emotion. I can't read or hardly focus. And my mind just feels blank. There is a lot I'm missing out on in terms of some of the stuff my mind does, but as you can see I'm pretty sure I have a long term issue and this short term problem. I need to get past this depression state first and then I need to fix whatever the long term issues is. I just don't know what to do and I'm scared honestly... does anyone have any ideas? Or can give me resources to maybe get some support? I'm a 17 male, graduated from HS. I'm falling behind in college because of this recent event. Sorry for long post, it could have been longer but I just needed to get some of this info across. Thank you...

Edit: thinking about this post I'm really not getting everything across that i want to talk about.. I never really can. It's like my mind won't let it out. I might be able to talk easier if asked specific stuff, I'm not sure. Just kind of lost :( ",30Sep2017,1
35,"[Danish from xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1027/) explains it better than I can:

""You look like you're going to spend your life having one epiphany after another, always thinking you've finally figured out what's holding you back, and how you can finally be productive and creative and turn your life around. But nothing will ever change. That cycle of mediocrity isn't due to some obstacle. It's who you are. The thing standing in the way of your dreams is; that the person having them is you.""

Now, I don't think I'm at all like the creepy guy in the comic, but I sure relate to what she says about him. I do this constantly. I am extremely guilty of caught up in some idea, thinking ""yes, if I do this, this is what will change my life,"" then after either a few days or sometimes a few minutes I get bored of it. And it's a problem. I quit antidepressants because of some epiphany thought of ""no, I must have ADHD instead"" all because of one internet post that said people with ADHD develop anxiety and depression. I keep quitting therapists because I get caught up in sudden ""epiphanies"" when I'm feeling ok that get me thinking things like ""when I wasn't feeling ok, I was just being over-dramatic, I don't need to waste money on a therapist."" I've alternated between wanting to be a christian family man and wanting to sex it up while I'm young at least 3 or 4 times in the past month, every time fully convinced that it is what will make me finally happy. During the former I tell myself that living to make my future better will make me happy, during the latter I tell myself nobody actually does that, and many people live it up while they're young and still end up fine.

It seems to be a double-edged sword, since I've been living off these ""epiphanies"" for quite a while now, and when I tell myself not to listen and to finally stick to a path, I just end up real depressed thinking I can't do anything. The fake bursts of motivation at least kinda kept me going. How can I tell which thoughts are actually ones that will make me happy and which ones are just fleeting and wrong?",30Sep2017,5

39,"So I'd like to begin with that I'm set to speak to a professional on Monday, but I'm at a low and I need to write it out of me.
I am a man in his late 20s. I have been very conscious about my looks since I was 19, and my obsessive thoughts about my unattractiveness resulted in several hellish streaks in my life when I was unable to do anything except hate myself and the world. Sometimes it even resulted in me breaking mirrors or simply destroying things in my sheer frustration.

The thing is, I know I am not ""ugly"", as in, I am not deformed, obese, extremely disproportionate. In fact since I started grooming myself and wearing stylish clothing, no one ever gave me any negative feedback about my looks. But I feel this is not enough.

I'm 5'9 (176 cm), and I feel I am too short, any time I am out in the city I feel dwarfed by all the tall people around me. My face is not ugly, but it lacks manliness - I don't have a good jawline, I have a recessed chin (and I can grow no beard), and my eyes have dark circles so that I am regularly asked if I was up all night.

I know I am not repulsive, but I am unable to figure out where do I fall, and - which is the core of my problem - what kind of girls I could realistically pursue. There are lots of girls I find attractive, but I always feel that I am not enough for them, that if I find them attractive, other, more attractive guys will do too. And when I see these girls with their boyfriends, I always feel that they are far superior to me. So then I conclude that my ""level"" are the girls I do not find attractive, and when I feel this, I also feel like just outing myself because why live if I will never experience true love with someone I am attracted to?

And whenever I hear someone say ""you have to first love yourself to find love"", ""you have to be happy alone to attract someone in your life"", etc., I just want to puke. People who are happy alone are happy because they know that they are good enough for people they would want to be with. And I had a few short flings with attractive women (way older than me - I had an attractive partner who was younger than me only one time), and those were the best days of my life, when my self-hatred vanished and I felt such a fool for thinking like that, but as soon as they were gone, I was back to my old self-loathing mindset.

I thought about having plastic surgery (I have one main flaw that I always hated), but I never got around to it, even now that I have the money, because for some reason I feel that it wouldn't change anything, and I would just feel fake and narcissistic after.

That's another thing: I am so ashamed of this all. There are terrible stuff happening to people, sometimes even around me. And I don't care. The only thing I care about is how I look and how attractive I am to girls, and I feel like it is unacceptable for an adult man to be this vain and self-centered. Yet I can't help it.

I would like to add that no one around me except my parents knows about these things - to the outside world I am a confident, good-humoured guy. I am an entrepreneur, I am respected in what I do and I earn multiple times the national average. But I'd give all that away just to be in a body in which I feel comfortable, not like being in a prison.",30Sep2017,1
41,I'm feeling really depressed everyone. I don't really wanna go too in depth right now I just don't feel good and just need someone to tell.,30Sep2017,5
43,"Ever since I was little, I've experienced fits of uncontrollable rage. I get mad, throw things and abuse people near me. I'm normally a calm and empathetic person, but as soon as something starts to go wrong, I just fly off the handle. I need to deal with my emotions *some*how, so would crying be better than getting angry?",30Sep2017,1
44,"I have OCD. If I walked a certain path I had to walk back the same path, stepping on the same exact spot I stepped on when I got there. If I stepped on the wrong spot (or even felt I stepped on the wrong spot) I had to walk back and forth a specific number of times. I also spend hours debating which path to take. I was in therapy for one year. Basically the therapist tells me if I have a compulsion to remind myself if I avoid my compulsions nothing is going to happen. We talk about strategies for avoiding my compulsions. The therapy has not helped so I am looking for a different therapeutic technique or maybe natural vitamins and nutrients that could help. I cannot work currently due to the OCD ",30Sep2017,1
45,"I have been mostly doing very well at staying positive, the other day I had a really bad ptsd day and the shitty landscapers they hire were here making all kinds of noise and I was on edge all day, took so much energy to keep it together, but I did. I posted a vent/rant on the ptsd forum and the only reply was an attack from a random troll calling me nasty names so I just deleted it. :(

Now today I just feel totally depressed and about to cry and I don't really know why. 

I'm trying to not be hard on myself, just accept that once in a while I'm going to have a day like this, that I can't hold it together and stay positive every single minute of every single day dealing with MS/chronic pain, ptsd, etc.  

I'm home alone at the moment and it is already really dark outside and it was chilly today and it just feels really depressing right now.

I just needed to vent. Thanks for listening. :)

46,"I don't know if this is a universal thing, but it is certainly happening with people I have talked to who have mental health issues and I do it myself. What it is, is that people with mental health issue give the best advice to the people around them who are struggling, but then find it so hard to follow their own advice themselves. This has happened so many times to me. I will be on a app, getting to know new people and stuff, and they will have so many problems and stuff that I have answers and I can help them with their problems, but then when it comes to helping me and getting me out of the dark places I am in I struggle so much. I think like, something about having depression makes me want to stop anyone else getting it, or help others who have it get out of it. Like I always say that I wouldn't even wish depression, or anxiety or any mental illness on my worst enemy because of how harmful it is. But I am always amazed at how kind and caring people with depression and other mental illnesses are. Like honestly I admire people who are going through depression because it is such a hard thing to get through,  and I realise first hand how hard it is just to function daily with any sort of mental illness, and I just want to say chin up, the world is a better place with every single one of you in it, because you go through pain that is unimaginable to others and still manage to act like you are okay. Honestly have so much respect for anyone going through a mental illness right now, especially with how under funded the whole system is. ",30Sep2017,8
