0,"I've been going through my memories tonight and it occurs to me that one of my biggest issues, and I have a lot right now, is that all the way back to when I was a kid I've had a kind of mental distantness from everything to the point where I lack self-control because the world can seem kinda wishy washy to me sometimes. I simply get lost in whatever I'm indulging in to the point where I lose sense of myself and it becomes cringeworthy to look at.

As a kid it wasn't that bad, but as an adult it's caused all sorts of issues with anxiety and loneliness. I was rejected a lot in general as a kid by my peers. Something between the lines was off about me. I could tell sometimes that i felt different but I also thought I was somewhat decent socially despite of a few oddities but there was always something weird between the lines that people never pointed out but started abandoning me for. Sometimes it would be a look in their eye as I was talking as if they didn't understand me or they had some kind of realization and it made them turn away and I'd be left not knowing what just happened.

The earliest memories I have of whatever this root-cause is is when I was going to the mall with mom or dad and I'd get bored and when I get bored I get super tired, like so tired that I can almost go to sleep -- just complete lethargy. It happened in school a lot too. I would doze off and my teacher would think I was rude and intentionally trying to look disinterested. One time a classmate said ""you seem stoned sometimes"".

As I got older and got through terrible high-school years where my problems suddenly got really bad for me socially, I got my first job and I'd be working with people much older than me. Even so, they'd openly joke sometimes, one coming over to me clapping his hands in front of me; ""WAKE. UP!"" he'd say in a joking tone. I'd just laugh at it and shake my head. At this point I knew this was something with me that just doesn't change and it was the first time I realized it was really a thing.

And it interferes with my studying A LOT; I can't even feign interest if I'm slightly unfocused on something and i just can't get through the lessons. I might even be failing an exam soon because I just can't get into it properly. Socially I'm not just a dork, I'm hopeless. I couldn't engage in music with my best friend because I can't keep my focus long enough to play songs tight enough, my sense of rhythym is good but my inner tempo is up and down all the time. Good luck with finding a girlfriend I'll tell myself becuase one second of dozing off on a first date and I'd be done for.

I do have friends... kinda. I have my close family that cares and I see them from time to time; just got home from NYE at a big party in fact but I was terribly awkward at it, and I have my friends from school and childhood who I basically never see but we just chat or play online games sometimes. Also, anytihng competetive, chess, sports etc. I just can't do it because it's 20 minutes and I'm done -- don't wanna do it no more but the other guys be like ""Let's go again"". The consequence of compromising is that I start to sink into myself and sometimes feel downright derpessed, especially if it's soccer. I just get too self-conscious and my thoughts start racing becuase i can't concentrate on what's going on in front of me.",03Jan2017,8
1,"So after almost a year of getting help (seeing a therapist, working with a psychiatrist and case manager) I'm finally on the upswing. I got my meds worked out and I even got a new job after almost 9 months of being out of work.

The downside is that with a new job comes new benefits that don't kick in until 90 days. That means for three months I won't have my meds because they are too expensive. I've decided to stop taking them now so hopefully I will be adjusted by the time I start my new job so I don't have to deal with both at the same time. Also, this way in case of emergency if I get bad again I have a little bit of a stock to start back up before my new benefits kick in.

I know I'm not supposed to go off my meds without consulting a doctor first but that's not really one of my options right now. So I think that I've made the best decision for myself given the cards I've been delt. And I do plan on resuming my meds as soon as my insurance kicks back in, so it's not a permanent hiatus.",03Jan2017,1
2,"I'm 29. I have a lot of mental issues. I'm diagnosed with panic disorder, ptsd, depression, and OCD. I've been playing musical chairs with medication for a decade, unsuccessfully dredging through therapy, trying to find what works with no success. I take prozac, lamictal, clonodine, and klonopin.

I was abused as a child by my mother in extreme ways. I was sexually abused, physically abused, and was forced to kill animals for her amusement. The order was: kill a puppy, or she would kill my father, who was unaware of the abuse because I was too terrified to tell him. She was an insurmountable prison until she died from chronic meth use as I turned 18.

It's difficult to describe some of my symptoms. I despise myself. My self esteem couldn't be lower. I cannot function in society and receive disability. My saint of a Dad that saved me from my monster of a mother and takes care of me. I can't get out of bed in the morning. I have flashback nightmares whenever I close my eyes. I feel nothing but guilt. I hide all of this behind a smile, and when I am social, people can't tell that anything is wrong with me. My father, my doctor, my therapist, and my closest friends were the only ones who knew about my issues.

I would have never submitted this pity party of a post, and remained behind the smile mask. Without this incident, I would have never posted this.

I toyed around with Tinder in the past just to talk to people, but I never swiped right on anyone because I felt unworthy of female companionship. I turn 30 this year and haven't had my first kiss yet.

I caught a bad cold mid December. This lead to my first ever sinus infection. My head felt like it would explode, with pressure pushing on the back of my eyes. After searching online, I discovered that an over the counter called ""Sudafed"" helped with sinus pressure, so I bought some after showing my ID. I took it as directed by the box. It helped my symptoms, and after two days, I started recovering. Something extraordinary happened. The vast majority of my non ptsd symptoms vanished. The self hatred, doubt, paranoia vanished in an instant. All of those feelings became petty as I began to feel worthy of happiness. I felt near invincible and my focus became crystal clear. I opened Tinder, and started swiping right on anyone that seemed interesting while thinking ""why not? The worst thing that will happen is that I won't get liked back, or at worst, rejected."" Even thinking those words before the Sudafed would have caused a panic attack, but now I could just shrug them off. I would now be able to make something of myself and stop being a leech on society. I was cured.

When I woke up the next morning, everything was as before. All the benefits vanished overnight, and the miasma returned. I figured I had just had some sort of mental breakdown and that I imagined everything. I got up, took one last dose of the sudifed to relieve the sinus pressure, and I became invincible again. Without a doubt, the variable was the Sudafed. Because my sinus infection was gone, I stopped taking the medication because I didn't want to abuse it for reasons not intended by the pharmacy.  I had to be sure.

Coincidentally, I have an appointment in two days to see my psychiatrist. I'm a wreck again, and I will not take the Sudafed again unless directed to. What the fuck happened? Why did an over the counter medication for sinus infections fix my problems? Does anyone have any idea how this is an actual thing?

**TL;DR:** I'm an emotional wreck. I got sick and took Sudafed. Most of my mental symptoms vanished. I see my doctor in two days. Any idea why this happened?

3,"So basically I'm 17 and I started going to a therapist recently to help me through my problems , such as addiction , anxiety and depression . He's letting me understand why I resort to drugs to feel better and it's making sense . As a child my parents divorced when I was 3 and I moved with my mom , and she had a Boyfriend who loved to drink , they both loved to drink . They were both alcoholics yet in denial of it .  And they would fight every single night and say very mean things a mother should never say to their children (I have a sister) 


My therapist thinks that the way my childhood went affected me without realizing it , which I tend to agree . 
He was reading in a book about a personality trait , which I had all the traits of , Escapism , Can't trust because I was afraid of getting hurt , procrastination , self pity , addictive personality, highly sensitive , social anxiety , anxiety . 
I just forgot what it was called . 

But anyways , my mother talks to me on the phone every night and it's really been affecting me , she's in denial of hurting me when I was younger , mentally . And blames her ex husband (not my biological father) , and she doesn't understand me at all , she just thinks she does . She gets on me about using drugs , as she is most likely sipping on beer/wine . She thinks alcohol isn't a drug because it's legal, which is pretty close minded . She just complains about what I'm not doing , she doesn't understand from my perspective . 

All my life I've been treated pretty terrible , with minor parts of it being ""okay"" it's just what I got used to . She's making it seem like it's so easy to get Better and change the way you think completely, while dealing with depression , anxiety , and drug abuse problems . What do you think the best thing would be to do ? She really aggravates me a lot which causes even more stress . Don't get me wrong, she cares a ton about me , it's just not the way I'd like to get advice, I don't feel she's helping at all , just making it worse , she's extremely stubborn , so getting her to understand my ways is near to impossible .

5,"I would really like to talk to someone about these delusions and strange thinking patterns that I seem to have. I want to get evalued, but I don't want to alarm my parents. 
Only an hour ago I was with a friend and said something stupid and immediately threw up an image up of myself from her point of view in my mind, looking stupid from her eyes. This caused me to look to this image and act like this image, not really feeling my own emotions but just mimicking what I saw. 

Is this strange? I have a past post that also talks about an issue I recently realized I had.

7,"Hello,

I'm a 26 year old female in the U.S. who suffers from GAD, depression, and OCD. 

I recently aged out of my dad's health insurance and from now until early February (when I move to a new state), I will not have insurance.

I've been on 20 mg of Prozac for about 10 years now. I'll be covered with my meds for a few more months.

Recently I've developed a fear of flying that has interfered with my ability to do my job and attend to my personal life.

Several family members and friends have suggested Xanax to me, as a medical aid to get back to flying. However, I'm concerned with how my Prozac may interact with the Xanax.

Basically, I would love to NOT have the physical anxiety symptoms and I want to lose the racing thoughts. I don't want to be completely ""drugged out"" in case I need to make a connecting flight or in case of emergency.

Does anyone have any input/insight into how a Prozac user may react to small, sporadic doses of Xanax?

Thank you very much!

8,"So I won't get into the details of my entire backstory, but I've finally decided to see a doctor for what I believe is most likely depression/anxiety, or at least something related. I've debated doing this for nearly 4 years but finally decided that it has gotten bad enough and gone on long enough that I have to do something.

I need information or advice/stories on how you found the right psychiatrist/therapist/etc. I was going to call my GP tomorrow to try to get a referral. My insurance is a PPO I believe. Is this the best way or should I try to contact a psychiatrist directly? Any advice or info is appreciated! &lt;3",03Jan2017,6

14,"Background: I suffer from anxiety, depression, (recently discovered) inattentive ADD, and a possible binge eating disorder

So I started working at a grocery store bakery a few months ago on a whim and I loved it. Then, finals came and I was incredibly anxious, depressed, and unfocused on both work and school (school is not going well either, I'm in my third year and still have no idea what I want to major in). Now that school is over, I thought working would go back to being enjoyable but I feel like it's gotten worse. Constantly packaging things, facing, stocking, and helping customers used to help me forget about my issues for a while, but now I don't want to do any of the work while I'm there and am more prone to slacking off. I've never been like this before, I'm usually a very hard worker who takes her job seriously (more seriously than others, I'm told). I don't know if this is because I've never worked a job longer than 2-3 months (summer jobs) or because it's retail or because my issues are getting worse, but I need to figure it out because I hate myself every time I purposely don't do something that needs to get done just because I don't feel like it. I also feel like I never have free time because I work 5 days/week and spend my free time thinking about the next time I have to go to work. I work between 20-29.5 hours every week because that's the position that was available when I was hired. It doesn't sound like much, but it takes it's toll on me and I always feel like I'm wasting my off days sleeping in or doing nothing at home.
I want to quit so badly, but I know they need me and I want to prove to myself that I can last in a job for more than a few months. I'm completely miserable, though, and I don't want to be anymore. Any advice or personal experience would be appreciated.

tl;dr: My job in retail makes me miserable and lazy (which I'm normally not) despite the fact that it's not that bad of a job, and I don't know how to enjoy it again or if I should even try anymore.",03Jan2017,3

19,"I have General Anxiety Disorder, and often call myself an over thinker. About a month and a half ago, I broke up with a girl that I'd been seeing for three months. We spent a lot of time together in those three months, so getting through this has been arduous and painful. I regret how unguarded I left myself during this relationship - Ending things cut very deep, and the fact that she's still in my life as a friend has made moving on pretty hard. 

People assume that I'm okay now, and while the depression I've experienced has diminished over the past couple weeks I'm sitting up writing this because it's keeping me awake. I'm not sure at this point whether I'm still doing the healthy thing of mentally processing everything, or whether my overthinking is fully in the driver's seat at this point. 

The past few weeks have been difficult not just because of the heartache, but also because it unraveled some deeper personal questions about my self esteem.

I was sexually assaulted five years ago and since then, I have all the fun symptoms of PTSD like depression, very bad social anxiety, anxiety in general, panic attacks, etc. Basically I feel like I can't do anything and I don't want to tell my parents bc they already think I'm faking my anxiety and told me that I ""keep them hostage"".

I can't think straight.  My thoughts are disorganized, as is my speech.  I can't even communicate with my wife.  I warble and slur and use strange words and phrases that I guess I just sort of made up.  I have issues controlling my volume, always too loud or too quiet.  I feel very emotional all the time, but these emotions are so confusing and complex they I can't express them to anyone, so I just stand still.  Things that normally wouldn't so much as irk me are causing me to be furious to the point at which I have to drop everything and focus on not breaking things.  I'm going from incredibly sad and depressed to where I want to cry for either no reason or for very small reasons to all happy and joyous, delirious, even.

The walls are moving behind me, but only when I'm not looking.  Whenever something's going wrong a work, I just know that someone (Not a person, but some far-off entity) is trying to torment me.

I forget what I'm saying in the middle of when I'm talking, and my thoughts jerk from whatever it was I was trying to say to incredible fears and anxiety.

My language is very violent and disturbing to my wife and coworkers.  I don't even know what I'm saying half the time.

I've been drawing occult symbols and mathematical questions in my journals I have no comprehension of.  

I'm subconsciously trying to speak in different languages I don't even know in everyday conversation.

I don't know what's happening, and I can't go see a professional because I'll be damned if I can afford that.

I'm very scared.  I don't know what to do.  I feel like even posting here will get me on some sort of list.  I am very angry, but not at any one particular thing.

I keep going out and buying cigarettes even though that money's for rent.  I finish the packs in an hour or two.

Please.  Help me shed some light on this.  I'm frenzied, but I can focus to some degree.  Something's wrong with my head, and I'll save up for medical care, but that might be a bit.  In the meantime, I'd like to understand so I can get some things under control.

26,"So I'm not really sure where to start or if this is the best place to post. I have a female friend with a variety of problems and I'm not sure the best way to help her, get her help or react to her. First of all, medically she would be considered obese. She has a lot of body issues because of her weight gain that have increased respectively over the past 5 years. Second, she has arthritis that she's been struggling with since a young age. It's very manageable when she takes her cocktail of medications but prevents her from doing any kind of serious exercise since certain workouts can be bad for her joints. She swims but in my opinion not enough to contribute to any significant weight loss.Additionally I would guess she has a combination of depression, anxiety, and some form of ADD. Depression because she's unmotivated, had wild mood swings, is generally pessimistic/negative, spends large amounts of time watching tv, and has mentioned that she probably is. Anxiety because she has the hardest time making the simplest decisions. It will take her an hour to pick out a hand cream at the store or anything off a menu. 9/10 times 20 minutes before an event she'll start crying saying she doesn't want to go. I think this is a result of her anxiety and insecurity stemming from not feeling confident in her appearance. ADD/ADHD because she has a hard time focusing on conversations or completing tasks. Apart of the issue is that she's extremely unorganized so that doesn't help. She leaves everything last minutes because of this so everything piles up and she ends up overwhelmed and ends up shutting down. 

Soooo, it's hard to know where to go from here. She's depressed because of her body issues that she isn't able to resolve through exercise because of her arthritis. She has a hard time eating healthy because she's too unorganized to create a meal plan. She is unwilling to take any kind of medications to help her ADD/depression/anxiety because she feels she's already on enough medication for her arthritis. She's also in bad relationship. Her and her fiance are both in a very loving relationship but they're not able to communicate so they end of fighting without resolving any core issues. I'm sure a lot of the issues in her relationship stem from her personal issues mentioned previously. She currently lives with her parents and has no bills other than her car as her family supports her financially. She has a job that pays extremely well but she's unfulfilled there and doesn't take on additional hours to advance her position. She is in college which she's finding stressful but rewarding (one positive!).

Basically I think a lot of people in her life are starting to get impatient with her negativity. She's not excited about anything in her life, not even her engagement which you'd think would brighten her spirits. Anytime there's a planned outing its a guarantee that she'll have an episode. She's late for everything and you cant complain because then she'll be in a bad mood and that's worse. She's gone to a therapist and was given a variety of coping methods which helped but now doesn't want to go back and wouldn't tell anyone why.

Do you think we are all being selfish by being frustrated or should we be firm in telling her what she needs to do to get better? Everyone's been so supportive and nurturing but that doesn't seem to be doing anything and she doesn't seem to be capable to help herself. ",03Jan2017,2

34,"So. Some basic info. I'm 17, male, a junior in high school. Got people I gave a label called ""friends."" Not sure how a friend is supposed to work, so I gave them that label. Hate my family - mother is narcissistic and abusive, step-father is a Catholic sheep who can't think worth shit, earns a lot of money.

I have no clue who I am in terms of what can be labeled for my processes in my brain. In other words I have no clue what is wrong with me, only that something is not right. Like I am a defective piece of machinery.

I feel little to no empathy. I only say ""little"" to show a superficial display of pain or some other body movement denoting a particular emotion (such as watching a wrestler on TV drop-kick another wrestler) - but upon further analysis, I found that I imitated (to a smaller degree) my step-father's actions a la monkey see, monkey do. When someone is injured, I feel nothing for them. Yet I put on my superficial look of what people call ""worry"" and try to look like I'm really helping that person. I'm apathetic. I consider empathy making people weak and it screws with their judgment. I could watch someone get brutally raped and murdered right outside my window and I would not feel a thing.

I wouldn't call myself smart. Sure, I might be able to notice something faster than someone else, but that's about it. As for observations, I notice what other people do. A nervous tick, excessive blinking, personality. Their tone. Their features. Like any other person would.

I would say my superficial charm does not apply to my peers. My teachers are a different story. I see that almost all of them like me.

I have sadistic tendencies that have been kept in check by the mere existence of rules (don't hit, don't run in the hallways, etc), although I'm not above telling one of my female friends how I will use her joint lactose-gluten intolerance against her while keeping her suspended with chain cuffs in a cage. For caution, I add in something that implies a hypothetical situation. I manage to get away with that remark because nobody takes me seriously.

I have no urge to torture animals. I like knowing that whoever I torture will know that I'm doing it for myself and they can't do anything about it. Animals just have fear, a primordial urge to escape, they don't think about who is pleased to watch other suffering. That's why I would prefer a human for my personal torture, because they know I am pleased by it.

I find the concept of ""rape"" (as perhaps quite possibly implied by my mention of torturing humans and associated pleasure from said torture) to be useless to me. Too much trouble, there are rules to keep me in check, it is simply not advantageous for me to rape someone whenever I feel like it. No. Considering how it will impact the rest of my life, I'm not willing to take any risks. 

I have a lax attitude when it comes to everything, much to the detriment of my grades (around A- to C+ range). I am very self-serving.

I can feel emotions, but I am also confused by who I am. I can feel love... but that's for the female friend. I guess that is called a ""crush."" But I feel hate more, just for the fact that everyone around me is a waste of oxygen and I hate living in general. I didn't ask to be born. I want to die.

At this point in life, I'm just busy dying. 

If society suddenly breaks down, and rules (not laws as we know them as laws cannot be broken while rules can be violated), then I will have no problems doing whatever the hell I feel like doing. When faced with moral dilemmas, I found myself choosing a more stigmatizing choice.

Everyone who I meet is useful. I do not hang out with anyone useless to me. Smart students to help me with school? Yep. In order to win their favor, I bribe them with minor things. My relationship with the school faculty has managed to keep me in school when I should have been suspended for allowing someone to plagiarize my assignment. Said relationship has also granted me nice passes for late homework assignments. My female friend (who saw right through me) doesn't seem to care, and so I use her to talk to her. It then somehow evolves into a conversation about why we have morals and how I am barely kept away from prison by a social construct.

I am a person who has a clean room - that is, a room with no obstructions of any kind, except for my closet, bed, and nightstand?

What is up with me? Now that I listed all I know about myself, can anyone tell me? I looked up everything, and I am starting to doubt psychology and psychiatry altogether, since anyone can self diagnose themselves to be sociopaths or have cancer.",03Jan2017,2
35,"Hi all, long time lurker here. Im a 19 yo guy and I though I would come look for some advice here. For a while now I have been struggling with what I think might be Depression and Anxiety amongst a bunch of other feelings that confuse and scare me.

I'm not in a bad situation or anything. I don't have any qualifications and I am working a job I have no future prospects in but aside from that I am pretty well off in a middle class family with a nice house.

Most of the time I am able to distract myself with anime, games or reading but when I have a moment to myself I can't help but feel sad and empty. Whenever I make a mistake I get super mad at myself then fall in a depression for a while.
I just can't bring myself to do anything, I used to love going out with friends or reading but now whenever I feel want for something I just can't be bothered doing it, even if I makes me happy.
 
I'm scared of going to see a psychiatrist or doctor. I just imagine being told that there's nothing wrong or being told I can't be fixed or being completely misunderstood. I don't feel comfortable talking to family or friends either since I don't want to worry or be any more of a burden to them than I already am. I feel like a failure

I just don't know what to think or say alot of the time now, I feel like my head is just a jumble of contradicting emotions, thoughts and opinions where anything I do with confidence or calmness might be replaced by regret or anger at any moment.
