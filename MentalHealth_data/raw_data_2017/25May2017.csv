1,"I'm having a curious relationship with my depression meds. I take sertraline (Zoloft) and bupropion (Wellbutrin), and have reached a happy balance where the dosage seems to work well.

However, I went through a brief period where I decided to wean myself off the sertraline, and the withdrawal was I-N-T-E-N-S-E. So I went back on it at the dosage I was at before.

But this left me really concerned and upset. What if my body is ""addicted"" to the sertraline? What if I can't live a ""normal"" life without it? 

Oddly, I have zero quandaries with the bupropion, but that's it's own curiosity. 

I'm trying to think of a comparison that will help me change my view. An analogy that has been helpful: If your body is vitamin-deficient, you can take a vitamin to replenish it. Therefore, if your brain doesn't make enough whatever-neurotransmitter, you take x-medication to replenish it. But then I think ""Okay, yeah, but your body would need those vitamins externally (from food) anyway,"" so the analogy doesn't translate. What about insulin and diabetes? Well, I've never personally experienced that, so I can't relate to that analogy either. I'm getting too circular in this thought pattern, but I'm trying to find something that sheds some light here...

I don't know. If anyone has insight, I'd love to hear it.",25May2017,1,

4,"Hi guys,

I've been on and off benzos for years, had a 6 mo break and now on them to help me sleep. I have a solid tolerance where I need anywhere from 10-25 x 5mg Nitrazepams to put me solid to sleep. This is clearly not sustainable so I'm looking at other means including CBT and such

One thing I did notice, is that the following morning after taking 10-25 x 5mg (about once a week maybe twice tops)- I always woke up much more alert, more pushy/motivated to go gym (interestingly; my strength suffers), I'm more likely to talk to others, little or no depression, huge appetite increase, and in general increased motivation to get things done. As the day wanes on this fades pretty quick and is replaced with standard benzo hangover, decreased mood (lasts few days), strong desire to nap throughout the day, splitting headache, affected memory, decreased or no motivation to do said set out things.

The closest I've gotten to replicating this 'motivation' spike without benzos, (usually between collecting a prescriptions), is constantly going to the gym, regardless of how I feel- (but there are days when I wake up with ZERO energy so rolling out of bed to gym feels or seems almost impossible). Sometimes/often even If I push through this I'll arrive to university feeling almost completely flat, tired, poor appetite (improved if I go gym) lacking strong motivation-- Perhaps this is connected to withdrawals?

Currently I take melatonin, the 1-2 a week use of benzos, nexium for reflux, and 40mg of lexapro

What do you guys think could be cause of this odd massive behavioural/motivational change? Didnt think benzos can feed motivation to you",25May2017,1,

7,"Firstly, all diagnoses are done by Dr. Google and myself, so terms may be off.

**TL;DR**: To much going on to give TL;DR. I'd rather let the whole thing out and not summarize.

So, here's a little preface about myself: 

I live by myself, with no family, nor do I have friends. I've been on my own for over 10 years. This has fed into causing myself to be really bad at the whole socializing thing. I also have really bad anxiety when talking about this, so please be gentle if you decide to reply. I am really fucking poor and can not afford any kind of medical treatments or prescriptions. Also I'm really nervous about even going to the hospital, even if I could afford it. I've drove there once for something unrelated to this, and sat in the parking lot and never went in.

I don't really have a true explanation of what it feels or looks like, I'm just trying to give metaphors or a lay-mans interpenetration because I have no idea what this is and cant find any info on the web. This does not look like the real seizure because there is not any extreme tensing of muscles, like I've seen from YouTube. It kinda looks like Parkinsons I guess? Just not all the time like they have, it's come and go.

So I think I'm suffering from some random types of a seizure/Parkinsons. This has only happened 5 or 6 times since, I think, 4 months ago. So I'ts not very common. Also I'm going to use ""event"" because I have no idea what this is.

My minutes til event is very speculative, this all could be happening within 5 minutes, but times given is what it feels like.


It all starts with my vision becomes super out of focus and blurry, making it nearly impossible to read, unless the font is super-sized, this is what signals myself that this ""event"" is going to happen in about 45 minutes. 

Next, my short term memory gets absolutely destroyed, to the point I will stand up and not know why I did. If I'm on a computer when this happens, I will think of a word to type, and immediately forget what word i wanted to type. This normally happens 30 minutes before the ""event"", so I know to go lay down. (it's really hard to do so because of the memory loss) This does not effect my long term memory, and I can recall what happened the night before.

Then when I go reach for a remote, or a drink, or try to move, at all, I begin to have tremors, this is when I know I need to not move and get to the floor, because the ""event"" is about 2 minutes away. The first time this happened it was very unexpected and I was sitting on a chair and softly injured myself when I fell to the floor. (the injury was superficial and it was not bad at all, the possibility of greater harm is what scared me.)

 

If I lay perfectly still, I don't get any shakes or involuntary movements. If I try to move, at all, I start shaking as if it was a seizure or extreme Parkinsons. If I'm laying down and go to stand up, I'll begin shaking pretty roughly, and it throws me back to the ground and I get a full body shakes feeling seizure-esq. They slowly go away, but comeback if I try to move. (mainly going from prone to crawl, on all fours is as far as ""standing up"" gets) This last somewhere around an hour. (again, no clue how long it actually is)

Retrospectively it feels like my body and mind have crossed wires and any action gets them into a type of fight for control. Brain says ""okay body: move."" Then the body responds by moving and the brain quickly interjects with ""hey, I didn't tell you to move, go back to where you were!"" This promptly begins the involuntary tremor/seizure. If I don't move, there are no complaints from the brain so nothing happens.

This ""event"" last for an hour or so, and then I promptly go to sleep. Correlation isn't causation, but I did notice it happens at dusk or at night.

Now that my background is out of the way, I can ask the question that brought me here:

Can this type of thing be fatal? Because of my financial situation, I only want to go to the doctor if this could be fatal *WHILE* this is happening. If fatal, I'll know to call emergency services. If it's not fatal, I got to chalk it up as a bad hand I was dealt.

I miraculously took a video of this happening with my cell phone.  I have no clue how to go from cell phone to here, but also will not openly post it anyway. I'd prefer to private message it if it's found to be needed. If you read all this so far, thanks for hearing me out. It's greatly appreciated.",25May2017,2,

12,"I need some support guys, I saw a woman get raped on a TV show (it was a crime awareness one) and I was like, ""Like, WTF, why would anyone do that"". I really shouldn't have watched the show, it's affected me mentally. I try to get the scene out of my mind but I just can't, and whenever I think of it my eyes go wide open. I want to forget it, but I guess the things you want to forget the most are the hardest to forget. I mean come on, if anyone wants to have sex, just get the approval or consent of the other person, and it'll be all alright. It's only fun if both people are having pleasure. It is not fun or healthy if it's forced. I really need some pointers so as to get that shit outta my mind. It's polluted my mind, and even though it was meant as an awareness thing, it was disgusting. No offence to people who like rough sex, but it's only okay if there's consent. ",25May2017,0,
13,"Hello everybody, I apologize if this is out of format. I have researched and haven't been able to find anybody who would be able to help me out in my specific situation, so I figured I'd consult reddit.

A quick tl;dr: I'm a touring musician who hasn't been to therapy in a few years and unfortunately I only realized at the beginning of this current tour (in Europe until the end of July, but changing cities almost every day for the next month) that I might benefit from speaking with somebody and getting professional help with things that I'm dealing with (pure-o, CSA trauma, other SA trauma, etc.).

However, I don't have a phone in Europe and on top of paying a therapist it would be too expensive to use Skype to phone somebody internationally. So, I'm looking for a therapist experienced in the aforementioned topics who would be able to do Skype sessions (audio or video is fine with me). Ideally able to take my insurance as well or affordable, but I'm more desperate at this point and am open to any suggestions.

Because this seems to be a niche category, I haven't been able to find anything--any suggestions would be much appreciated!",25May2017,1,

17,"Hello. I'm 20 years old and last year I had, what I believe to have been a schitzophrenic episode. I'm almost positive that's what it was, but what I was diagnosed with officially was actually bipolar disorder. Anyway I want to share my experience in hopes that there are other people out there who have had similar experiences. 

For about three months I lived in a totally different world. I believed that I was communicating with other beings and traveling different dimensions. It all started when I went to Beach Goth 2015. I was on acid. During a performance, I felt a weird connection with the music and specifically the lead singer. Something told me the singer and I were connected. Of course, I was on acid, so later when the acid wore off I didn't think about it. Flash forward to 2016. One day I'm drunk and admit to a friend that I think this same singer and I are soulmates, I'm still perfectly sane at this point, but something inside me just makes me say it. February comes and I go out to see the same band. This time the show is much much smaller, and I notice the singer look directly at me before they start. He smiled real wide and I got so shy because he was hot. Then 2 weeks later I go see the same band yet again, at a different venue. Before they start he spots me again and smiles and motions at me to get closer. During the show I see a blue string like wave coming from his throat, and I swear, swear swear SWEAR, that I can move the crowd with my hands. I sway my hands to the left, and the crowd sways to the left, I sway them to the right and the crowd moves to the right. Also when I sing the entire crowd starts to sing too. I experienced the same things at Beach Goth, except this time I wasn't on acid. I barely smoked some resin because I had run out of weed. That night might've been my last night of blissful sanity. 

The next day I go the park and cry, for some reason. I don't know why. I wonder if I'm Telekinetic. And I wonder if this guy is my soulmate. I only started thinking he was my soulmate after googling the symptoms that I felt. (Why google, why!) 

After this I got really into meditation and astral projection. One night I could've sworn I was visited by an astral being while I was awake. Something told me it was him. At this point I still wasn't as crazy as I would later become, I was still very sane and productive but as the days went by I lost it. Slowly I went more and more insane and about a month later I'm convinced that I'm talking to this guy every day through my mind, that he visits me through some sort of astral presence or whatever. I meditate and I see images in my head. Crazy stuff man. I can't remember the details but I would see very vivid images. I thought I was traveling through space through my mind. I would meditate for an hour and hear ""God"". At one point I thought Satan was inside me. I would have these delusions of cyborgs. I would talk to fictional movie/Tv characters. I almost ran in front of a moving car because I thought I would become an angel and enter a different world. I would hallucinate. I thought I was god. I stopped eating, I would spend all my time in my room. I stopped talking to people. Every hour of the day I was inside my head going through some crazy made up adventure. This lasted months. I was completely delusional. 

There is so much that happened in my mind and I kept it in a journal but due to the same inasinity I lost the journal. 

Eventually I started taking pills, resperedol and lithium, and eventually it all went away. Now I'm back to normal and I know that the ""soulmate"" thing is complete bullshit. It took some time to recover, a couple weeks ago I still cried about it. I'm not sure why I cry. Something about it makes my heart ache. Is it the fact that this stranger will never actually love me? Maybe. 

Now I'm normal and I've come to terms that all of this was fake. It was terrible and I wish it never happened but at the same time I enjoyed myself over all. 

Anyway I'm glad I shared this. Has anyone else fallen ""in love"" via schizophrenic/psychotic episode? Or ""traveled dimensions""?
I appreciate ANY kind of experience you can share. 

Also, I want to stop taking my pills. I have stopped for about a month now. Do you think it could happen again? 
Thank you.",25May2017,3,

19,"I don't really know where to start so here it goes. 

I think I have depression. I'm not sure, my fiancé says I do but she says that I don't want to admit to it and I'm denying it. So here it goes. 

We were together for some time, she was my everything and I loved her dearly. One day she left me for someone else and it was a downward spiral from then on. I became heavy into cocaine doing it almost 7 days a week not caring if I died or not. On top of that my kids mom was keeping my daughter from me (still is btw). 

Fast forward to now and almost 8 months of heavy drinking and cocaine usage to cope with the pain of what was going I felt dead inside. I often have thoughts of ending it; weather I'm on the highway and I close my eyes for 10 seconds going at high speeds to see if I can end it, or shaving I have thoughts of just slicing my throat and bleeding out, or leaving my car on the train tracks and waiting for a train. I'm convinced these aren't normal thoughts to have and I have them all the time. I don't know where to begin but I know this is a start. 

Also: am clean of cocaine and no long drinking heavy, but the sudden depression make me want to go back again.",25May2017,1,
20,"Hi all,

(Using a gender neutral noun for anonymity)

My sibling puts a lot of pressure on themself. they started crying once in a while a few years ago, everytime we try to talk to them they will say that we won't understand.

A few months ago, they started talking to themself while practising. It started off with simple, neutral verbal corrections, like what a teacher would say. 

It slower progressed harsher and harsher, and they would scold fu** very harshly and angrily. Their volume of ""teaching"" increased, words became harsher (stupid, idiot, retarded). Sometimes they would shout or growl out of frustration. 

Today was the worst I have seen/heard. They was literally shouting/screaming at themself. For reference, just imagine two people getting into a brawl/fight, and shouting at each other with anger. That was what my sibling was doing.

I tried googling ""shouting at oneself"" ""screaming at oneself"" ""taking too hard mental health"" but did not get any good results.

Can you advise on what we can do, as their family members? Every time we tried to talk to them, they will say ""no i didn't"" (not sure if lying, or really unaware) or just say that we won't understand, or that it (their anger at themself) usually passes.",25May2017,1,

23,"I have been fasting on and off for about a year now: intermittent fasting and extended fasting.  (I still have about 20 lbs. to go.)  I have been eating ketogenically for a little longer.  Basically I am been reducing my intake of inflammatory foods and increasing my intake of anti-inflammatory foods and doing away with inflammation in any and every way that I am able.  This has made me so much easier to get along with.  And it has made me so much easier to get along with **myself**.  My irritability has gotten so much better.  And my relationships with my wife and my son has gotten so good.    
              
That's the good news.  The bad news is that somehow I thought that now I can eat whatever I want because I am so much stronger now.  (I've made that mistake before.)  To a certain small extent that is true.  But we had family come and visit two days ago, and I thought that I could eat celebratory food just like anyone else.  My son brings home some ice cream.  My wife piles on the rice (carbs).  And I believe that curry is also inflammatory, but I just don't want to admit it, 'cause it's my favorite food, but I had a lot of curry also.  So by this morning I was so fucking irritable and uncomfortable, unhappy and unable to sleep.  My wife does something that irritates me and I explode at her.  It is exactly like all that inflammation just had to come out, and it almost always happens socially.  I have known of only two other people who have this kind of problem.  God! did I hate myself at that moment.  And my hatred turned inward and became guilt.  Finally I realized that ""hey, dumb-ass, you had how many carbs for dinner, how much curry, and oh so many Klondike ice cream squares?""  (Six I think.  I lost count.)  I can't say that my gloom and anger lifted immediately.  But it was so good to know that this anger and gloom and discomfort and guilt would not last forever.             

I apologized to my long suffering wife, but she did remind me that we have gone through this before.  I just have to plan on **NEVER, EVER** eating inflammatory foods again, **EVER**.  And to keep up the health building, including fasting.  Fasting triggers autophagy, apoptosis, and stem cell regeneration.  To intermittently fast even when one has no excess body fat is a very smart health building move.     

What do you'all think?  Have you ever heard of anything like this?  If it is extremely rare, that doesn't make it not real.  I have to live with the reality of it.  I don't mind, but please don't insult my intelligence and tell me that it is not real.",25May2017,1,

The sense of being perpetually bored may seem -- trivial from the outside. I have certainly been met with ridicule when trying to express this idea. It's not an insignificant part of what makes a depressed life not worth living.

Anyway, I wrote a thing, then I typed the thing, then I recorded the thing. Maybe somebody will find it useful when trying to relate to an afflicted person. Maybe somebody won't feel so alone. Maybe it will be me just talking into the darkness.

Somebody requested a transcript:

Today I don't want to talk about depression. I was all geared up to work on my latest project I will probably abandon in a few days. However, I can't concentrate on that because other thoughts keep intruding. Not suicidal thoughts, well no more than usual. Instead I have been thinking about anhedonia and the metaphor of depression. Specifically: why they are wrong. Or, at least, woefully inaccurate in describing my personal flavor of depression.

It seems from the way depression is talked about that it is a positive stimulus. Positive in the Pavlovian sense, where stimulation is added to a subject (like pleasure or pain). Anhedonia as a symptom is a clue to the mechanism of depression at work. It is THE mechanism of chronic, long term depression and the key thing for those who are unafflicted to understand loved ones afflicted by depression. The absence of pleasure. Pleasure is a function of the brain and is key to the survival of the organism. Our brains are wired to experience pleasure when taking a beneficial action. Biting into an apple is such an example. Sugar is an indicator of food that is safe to eat. It's present in just about all food – even ones typically thought to be savory. Notable exceptions are coffee and cocoa (in their raw state). These foods do contain caffeine which creates its own pleasure response. 

Anhedonia. The absence of pleasure. Or, as I will describe it, the failure of the brain to produce a pleasure response. I am walking into murky territory here since I have experienced this for so long my assumptions of the unafflicted experience may be off base. Please correct me if you take issue with my assumptions. Videogames, and their critique, is what clued me into my revelation. Somebody was describing the subtle stimuli of well-designed NES era games. This person described the effect of sound, color and accomplishment: pleasure. Satisfaction. 

I have been a fan of videogames as a member of generation NES. However, my fascination doesn't seem to come from the same place. I prefer thoughtful games of strategy and jRPG varieties (although I do enjoy other genre as well). The common thread of these games is the level of attention required to play them. When I play Star Ruler 2 (incidentally which is a fantastic and brilliant real-time, 4X game you should check out if you are a fan of the strategy genre) I eventually notice that my butt hurts and it is five hours after deciding to “just start” a new game with the intent of interstellar genocide. Many people would find the game tedious; I find it absorbing. However, I wouldn't describe those five hours as being “fun” or pleasurable. Rather, the time has passed with the pleasant lack of the inner monologue played on loop where I go over all the reasons why I am a piece of human garbage. These games are negative stimulus (or reinforcement) as they remove stimulus.

Which brings me back to anhedonia: the absence of pleasure. Depression is often described as this thing that makes life worse. Rather, I describe depression as a kind of signal interference. A static or fog that prevents the pleasure response from getthing through. 
At the time of writing it is graduation season. Some relative of mine will be taking part in a “I will no longer be babysat” ceremony which means I will have to endure two hours of interminable boredom while plastering on an expression of pride on my face. Then the family party afterward where I pretend to enjoy myself. Not for my sake (well, partially for my sake – being obnoxiously negative is bad for the organism) but for the sake of my girlfriend who will enjoy herself and shouldn't be punished for my bleak outlook on life. As an addendum, at the time of typing out what I had previously written, my girlfriend remembers how much I dislike family gatherings and came up with an excuse for me to leave early. Ah yes, we are a good fit for each other. I forget sometimes, but that is a different topic.

I engaged in a project a few weeks ago. Programming music in a tracking program. I taught myself to read music in a rudimentary fashion and how to translate that into the tracker. When all was said and done I realized the sheet music I was working from was fundamentally flawed. Still the task was complete and I learned some new things. That should elicit some pleasure to my understanding. Instead, I was treated to more static. Same static I get for cleaning out my car, doing dishes, or attending a maudlin milestone ceremony. Same static I get for buying a new phone, making my girlfriend her favorite food or receiving a compliment. Same static I get for practicing phrases in a new language on native speakers, eating my favorite food and playing video games I know that I like. 

Though I don't want to make it sound like my life is completely without pleasure. The inner monologue tends to drown out other things when I am uninterested in what I am doing, which is a decent chunk of my time. Typing up this podcast has been – pleasant. The task has quieted the inner monologue. There is no room for it during the production you are currently listening to, gentle listener. It takes quite a bit more for the signal to reach through. I am sure I don't – experience it quite as much as an unafflicted person; if I did, I wouldn't exhibit the behaviors I exhibit.

I have been going to therapy for a few months now. I have had about 10 sessions now I think. 
Now the thing is, these sessions are going absolutely nowhere, because I refuse to open up. I just cant do it.

As soon as I feel the slightest hint of sadness or crying i start noping out of there and just lock all of my feelings up and act like everything's fine. Of course thats not helping me. I try to avoid all touchy subjects because I will feel hurt, and I hate feeling weak and open like that. 
During therapy it also feels like my mind is all clogged up, I cant reach all of my sad thoughts and feelings. It feels like they are not there and I am overexaggerting.

44,"I recently got back to the states after a year in New Zealand. While I was there I was dating a really great guy. We were together for about six months before I left to do some more traveling and head home. We stayed friends, though we had limited success in keeping a friend-level distance. Once I got home I suggested we create a little more space so we can both work on moving on.

Nearly a month later, and four months after initially breaking up, he suggested we continue dating, and that he move to the states to be with me. I panicked and was unable to think about it clearly for two straight days, and told him I just needed to feel normal - that it wasn't such a good idea.

But now I'm second guessing it. I am considering asking if we could be together, but with lower stakes - see how it goes, see how my timeline works out for moving out of my mom's house (yay travel, boo resulting lack of $$), and decide as we go if it makes sense to move one of us across the world. 

Whether or not to flip-flop on him is a concern, but I realize that all you can do is ask. My big hangup in this is that one of my best friends here in my depressing hometown is another ex-boyfriend - from before my trip. I also really like him and I know he likes me too. I told him I just want to be friends, which has gone really well for the past year and a half since I left. However, I still can't shake the feeling that no matter what I do, I'll be losing one of these wonderful people. 

I'm heartbroken at calling it off with the boy in NZ, and willing to put in the effort to have a relationship. But I keep worrying that the boy here will move on and date a different girl.

Am I just trying to bargain an easy fix to my current sadness? Or does it mean something that I'm still all about him, four months later? Am I worried about the guy here because I'm in love with him? Or am I afraid that our friendship will change if he finds a girlfriend?

It all feels like way too much. But if anybody made it to the end of this... I could really use some input. Thanks.",25May2017,2,

But Ive always had an uneasiness since a young age, and for no particular reason too. I've never really been bullied, great family, lots of friends, I do a lot of exercise, get good grades, but I always get this sinking feeling, no matter the situation. I don't really have that much stress if I'm honest, but most days I come home and just cry. I know it sounds lame, but I just can't help it. And it's always for something trivial too. Like today it was because of one thing that someone who I've known to be a good friend said as a joke, yet it affected me so much for no damn reason. It's always little things, but they always add up. I'm one of the few weird people who dread the holidays, as most of my time is spent on my own with nothing to do but just drown in my own well of self pity and depression. Actually, I don't really know why I posted this. But hey it makes me feel better already. But if anyone does have any advice, I would appreciate it. Thanks guys.",25May2017,3,
46,"Around the time when my grandma fainted and started to have her health issues. I've heard a voice in my head that said, ""Go to sleep and you will visit a dream world"". Note, I have high functioning autism and have been diagnosed at the age of 3. But autism doesn't necessarily link to mental illnesses, just means you have a different way of thinking. I've obviously never had that dream where I visited the Dreamworld. But anyways, The voice got worse and worse over time. Whenever I would listen to music The voice would randomly interrupt my song, thus me kinda having a difficult time to think properly. But I was able to shake it off for the most part. But one day, I was laying in my sister's bed. And I heard the voice clearly say ""I Hate You"" inside of my head. It was one of the worst things I've ever heard. Over time the voice got more and more misanthropic and nihilistic. At some point The voice started to sound like an old man. And when I would see the voice, in my mind. It looked like an old caucasian, white haired, man in a dress suit. Like I said before, the voice is very misanthropic and nihilistic. Due to me always having a hard time making friends throughout my life, and being somewhat bullied in my middle school years. I started to hate everyone. I grew out of it, but the voice quickly picked up on this. No matter what I would tell the voice, it would deny everything. The Voice started telling me things like ""your shit"" or ""you're stupid"" or ""you are worthless"" and ""nobody gives a shit"". I've started to see misanthropes/nihilists for the hateful,evil people that they are. I absolutely hate misanthropes/nihilists because they're all over the internet. Due to me not being able to make friends in Middle School/Elementary or even High School. And me not being able to go outside that often. I turned to the next best thing, the internet on our familiy's computer. I would spend hours and hours playing computer games like Club Penguin, Poptropica, etc. And thus due to my family getting on my nerves and me not any having friends, I'd spend most of my time playing computer games and swimming in our backyard pool. I lived a lonely life, at the time i'm urrently typing this I'm 16 years old. I've always hated myself, because whenever I thought things were getting better. I'd fuck up and get back to the bottom of the pit that is depression. Do to me feeling bored with life, and finding life extremely boring. I feel that life is boring because, I'd look at these cartoon characters I'd watch on the TV and I'd see how their lives had much more action and purpose than there was in my life. Even if these characters died at the end, at least it was better than sitting around doing the same thing everyday. Honestly I feel like being a human/living life in general sucks. The two main sources of my depression are school and my family. I hate my family because they happen to be very ignorant and arrogant religious pieces of shit, and always putting me down. Ever since I was eight, when I would have a fun time while exploring my imagination, my mom mostly would always put me down and make me feel like shit. My family always made me feel like shit. Even the friends I had at middle school with made me feel like shit. Just because I wanted to be myself. I felt like society has always made me feel like shit in one way or another. Whether it be for my autism, or simply because I'm a girl, or because I was weaboo. I've always found a reason to hate myself. Do to me wanting to post my art online, but not getting very many views or likes when I did so. I felt cynical and started to hate my art. Thus the voice started to tell me that my artwork was shit. No matter what I did or what style I tried, I never got any likes or veiws. Sometime this year, The voice has gotten more aggressive than it ever has been before. The voices been telling me that I should be a Christian and I should stop drawing porn and watching cartoons/anime. But those things make me happy and are an outlet for my boring hellish life. My mom took note of this instead if my younger nephew isn't allowed to see it then why should I. Well, because I'm older and I know better. But she just came with an up with another bullshit argument. And she said she knows about anime, now I'm afraid that that painted the now I'm afraid that she now has a negative image of anime in her mind. My mom didn't approve of me being being goth, nor do my sisters. And when I told my mom that goth actually was a subculture that started around music, she came up with another bullshit excuse and said that's something fabricated to make parents feel better about her kids looking looking ""vampires"". Well, what if their kids want to look like vampires, they're not hurting anyone. I just cannot stand how judgemental society is. One day when I mentioned that I was goth to my sister, she said that she hoped I would grow out of my ""phase"". I found this very insulting and hurtful. Out of all the family members I have, I hate my mom and older sisters the most. Because they're the most judgemental and cynical bitches I've ever met. My mom thinks that all of goths worship Satan. Of course they would be so judgemental and homophobic, since they're christians. And the youngest one of my older sister should know better since she uses Tumblr. So this leading me to really, really, despise them. I can't believe that it's 2017 and there are people in the world who still think like this. And the voice took note of this. And that's when the whole christianity thing started with the voice in my head. Everyone I have ever met has been cynical, judgemental, or stuck up in one way or another. Especially on the internet, I've seen judgemental cynical people everyday. And thus with the general knowledge that people express their true colors on the internet. That caused me to even further my depression knowing how many evil, hateful, cynical, judgemental, and hypocritical people there are in the world. Even all the people around me, I honestly feel like I can't trust anyone. I've tried to make real life friends again, but I just feel like everyone ignores me. All my life I've either gone to one of the stuck-up schools, or the ghetto schools. I feel like no matter what I do, people will ignore me. So thus me feeling worthless. I know suicide isn't the answer, but I HONESTLY feel like I would be happier if I got away from everything.
