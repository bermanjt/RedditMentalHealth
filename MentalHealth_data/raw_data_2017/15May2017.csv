1,"I would like to know what everyone's perspective could be for this question
1. Why is there a stigma when it comes to mental health?
2. What can we do to get rid of the stigma?",15May2017,2,
2,"I wish I wasnt like this, and im trying to change. But being ""mentally ill"" is so lonely. It feels so damn lonely.

Like in movies and tv shows like mr robot they show mental illness as a challenge and people who go through it badasses. But its not like that. I wish it was.

Like when you feel depressed or anxious or whatever, it doesnt give you the same thing you think it would give you from movies and tv shows. Like this empowering, exciting feeling. It feels really, really lonely. It feels like you're the only person on earth sometimes. And it can be really, really scary too.",15May2017,39,
3,"I've been realizing something. Being alone is so much better.

When you're alone, you think more. You dont feel the need to be like everybody else. I used to be mad that I couldnt really make friends in school but now im completely fine with it because I realized that its better being alone.

When you're alone, things are way more peaceful too. When you actually try to be around everybody talking to everybody its not as peaceful cause something someone said can ruin your whole day. When you keep to yourself, its not like that. Its so much more peaceful.

Its better to be alone too because alot of times when im around people I feel drained. Im not as anxious and scared, but I just feel drained afterwards. Like I just wanna go to bed and sleep all day.

Do you like being alone or not really? ",15May2017,12,

6,"For about two years, I could feel my mental health slowly declining. It started when I was twelve, I had a little cousin that was like my brother die in an accident. I stopped hanging out with friends, I didn't play any of the sports I loved, and I isolated myself from all of my family. It was kind of clear that I needed help, but my family seemed not to notice a thing. I was incapable of asking for help, so I turned to the blade. I started cutting myself at night in my room when it got really bad. I have twelve scars on my left forearm that have faded. About a week after the first cut I began having suicidal thoughts. I took a bunch of strange pills but they just put me out for awhile. After that I didn't care about anyone's feelings, I just kept hoping I would die somehow. I resumed cutting and became a bit more suicidal at thirteen. I would see knives and pills and cars and just fantasize about killing myself with them but I never had courage. I'm fourteen now and I'm scared that I'll hurt myself or someone if I don't have help. Someone can do the littlest thing that annoys me and I immediately start thinking about hurting them, even if it's an accident. When I get angry I get so mad that I feel like I'm not myself anymore. That everthing I've bottled up starts coming out and I can't control unless someone is there to tell me to calm down but that doesn't always work. I started smoking marijuana and vape pens just to try and relieve some of the stress and whatever I'm feeling. Sometimes I don't know what it is that I'm feeling. I got suspended for ten days after the principal found about a gram in a cigarello that I had been saving for after school. My mom told almost everyone close to me about it and they started cracking jokes about it and telling me I shouldn't have done that. I couldn't say anything at all without it being turned on me. So I lashed out. I back talked and pushed people away. I commented rudely anytime they were brought up. I was offered an evaluation at an addiciton clinic but my mom refused to let me go to it because she had just gotten a job there and she didn't want our last names to be put together. I lashed out at her for that. I feel like I'm damaged. Like there's something wrong with me and I hate myself for it. I hate myself for not being better. ",15May2017,1,

11,"I [17m] have recently confirmed that my girlfriend [16F] of a bit over a year is a victim of sexual assault. I don't know when it happened but that it occurred before our relationship together. I have had inclinations about it for a while, and she has always been very difficult to communicate with. I do everything that I know how, to be supportive but she says she is conflicted about sharing things out of fear that I will say, ""it's her fault"" or what she calls 'typical guy responses' like ""oh, I'm so sorry."" 

She means a lot to me. Her emotional instability has taken a huge toll on me and my own mental health (I just started making amazing progress after a 2 year period of intense depression). 

I want to help her and I want to help myself. I don't believe her parents have done much to help her, nor do I know how much of her situation they are even aware of because of how little she shares with me. I've had numerous conversations with her where in which I've asked how I can be supportive and help her, only to be shut down and told I won't understand. Then when I take exactly what she says at face value (""I'm okay"" or ""just leave me alone"") she tells me later that I'm not being supportive. 

For a while, I had started feeling like I wasn't in a place myself to be in this relationship. I am a few weeks away from graduating high school and leaving for college in a few months. 

I just want her to get the help she needs. It's seriously tearing me apart.",15May2017,0,
12,I'm feeling quite confused after a long and very traumatic relationship with someone that I'm concerned may have a marked personality disorder.

13,"I have a roommate and I am trying to figure out if there's something wrong with him besides just being an asshole.

He has hoarder tendencies. He once bought a stores entire stock of winter gloves when they went on sale in the spring, because ""it's so cheap you can't afford not to buy it."" Our back yard has four broken grills he picked up on the side of the road.

He won't spend any money, but if someone else is paying, it's no problem, without so much as a thank you.

He's constantly saying mean or hurtful shit to people without giving it a second thought. He doesn't do it with me because I'd kick his ass.

He got divorced a few years ago because he basically gave zero fucks about his wife. I had to twist his arm just to get him to buy her flowers once on her birthday.

He believes in every conspiracy theory under the sun and believes we have no free will, that we are all controlled from the shadows.

He invites people over, people I never met and then, on a whim, decides to go bike riding with someone else and leaves them there. I told him I was going to start kicking people out.

But what really started making me wonder if he has more issues than just being a cunt involved a mutual friend that's part of our close nit group.

He swore up and down to everyone he never touched this chick, that she's just crazy and at some point tried to get us all to bail on her.

And to be fair, she is kind of fruit loops.

I was talking with her today and she told me how she found a nice guy and the date they went on.

But then told me about how depressed she had gotten about my roommate. How she was pleasuring him and how he wasn't returning the same kind of sentiments and at her lowest point she was just going to give up, just keep doing what he wanted and just be happy she was included in the group.

After all the shit he talked about her, trying to alienate her from the rest of the group and all this other nonsense, it just really pissed me off and made me wonder.

The woman in question is nice, none of us have any problems with her. And at no point were we ever given the idea she was loose or anything.

When confronted about his shitty behavior, he just kind of shakes it off and says, ""Yeah, well I'm retarded."" The thing is, someone called him retarded once, so now he uses it as a fall back any time anyone asks him why he's being a dick hole.",15May2017,1,

15,"I'll start off by stating that I am a 25 year old man who has never been in a relationship.  I have been actively trying to change my relationship status for the last few years.  I've gone on several dates, started using internet dating sites, even gave speed dating a try and meet someone but nothing ever comes of it.  My friends have always told me not to worry, that I'm a great guy and that Ill find someone eventually ect.  I am starting to feel hopeless about this whole situation.  

With that in mind, recently I have taken this feeling of hopelessness to a new level.  I have decided to give my self a date to change this or die.  If by the time I turn 30, I have still never been in a relationship lasting more than a couple months, I am going to liquidate all assets I have,  have a couple months of partying, traveling and just overall having fun.  Once the funds run out, I am going to kill myself.

Of course, that is the worst case scenario.   Up until that point, I am going to do anything I can to avert that fate.  I will continue with the speed dating, internet dating ect.  Keep going out and just living life as I do now.  Who knows maybe my friends are right and I'll find love where I least expect it.  This expiration date is put into place just in case and I believe that it is fair.  But being alone forever is just not something I am willing to live with.

16,"I live in the US.

for the past year or so, my mind has felt completely empty. I've been suffering from Lyme, which causes extreme fatigue and brain fog. However, even though physical symptoms have gotten better with treatment, the brain fog is still there. I'm prescribed stimulants to help with focus and energy, but with the stims my thoughts are even more absent. It's just.. nothing. 

I thought that maybe getting out more and socializing, reading again, or getting back into using my brain would help, but last week for the first time in years, my thoughts returned all at once. and I realized that no, it wasn't just all in my head, it wasn't just anxiety or lack of stimulation, it was something that just disappeared, and came back.  for the first time in years i felt like myself. Then 2 days later, they were gone again.

I used to be funny, i used to teach improv, I never ran out of ideas or things to say and learning was fun and exciting. Now i struggle to hold a basic conversation. It came back, and now it's gone. and I have no idea why or how to get it back. It's even more painful now, because I know it's not something I can work towards or improve. It's just a switch in my brain that's off, and I can't turn it on. I was smart, and funny, I loved to write and draw. I could remember everything I heard and was talented at everything I tried. I have nothing now. I just lie around all day and do nothing. I haven't even watched tv for months. Reading is tiring. I don't have thoughts, they're just gone. I'm not depressed, I've recovered from that. I just can't think. Ive become dumb, and blank. I'm just blank.

Just wondering if anyone has any alternative, original suggestions on how they have dealt with severe anxiety or at least got it under  control. 

I seriously can't take it anymore i'm losing my mind. It keeps me up all night but at the same time exhausts me. I freak out about everything and sometimes I get so anxious I feel like I can't breathe, my chest is on fire and the world is just fucking vibrating around me. Everything is moving so fast and my brain is constantly in overdrive, calculating a million different things at once. Sometimes I just tunnel vision on something and lose control entirely and just start going off. 

I don't want to be this angry all the time, and this afraid all the time, and this guilty and shameful all the fucking time. It has been like this since I was like in grade 6. Sometimes I have these periods where it isn't really there, but lately it has just been peaking and I just get absolutely terrified, or upset over nothing really. and the guilt of everything is eating me alive. Sometimes it makes my emotions soar, I go from 0 to 100 in no time, and sometimes I just get these strong impulsive urges out of nowhere.


I have tried therapy but it didn't really do anything for me. I have tried 3 different types of medication, they just make it worse, make me feel like im wired and strung out on hard drugs. literally. 

I just can't fucking take it anymore. The constant thoughts and constant sudden surprise surges of fear or adrenaline or anger or sadness. It is just always there, lurking in the shadows of my brain and lately thats all there is, I feel like i've wandered too far into the darkness and now its consumed me. Anyone who has tried something different and it has helped, please let me know.

22,"I know what Munchausen by proxy is, I've read a lot about it. However, I've been thinking about my specific case and what my parents did to me. 

They both show text book signs of being narcissists, I also remember a point where my father may have been told this by a professional (or it was implied) and it made him super angry. My mother just refused anything was wrong with her and when she did seek therapy she only ever talked about me. Which brings me to my point.

I was definitely abused in this fashion but it was never physical. It was always mental. However, they did force me on pills I never needed to take. Really heavy antipsychotics for a young teenager (mostly to keep me sedated) so they could tell people I was dangerous and prone to psychosis (never true). They didn't care if the pills made me sick because they genuinely loved telling their friends that I was such a DIFFICULT CHILD but they loved me SOOOO much and they were doing EVERYTHING they could. If I was sick I wasn't a ""problem"" for them (even if it was side effects due to medications I shouldn't have been on).

I do think that it could go either way. They either desperately wanted me to be mentally ill so they could brag about the mentally ill and difficult child they had to take care of (and be seen as saints because life was so hard for them) or they were both so narcissistic that they ""knew more than the doctors"" and labeled me with diagnoses that I didn't have because only they could see the symptoms. 

I always knew something was wrong, that I wasn't exhibiting half the symptoms they claimed I was. I was tested repeatedly for various mood disorders (Bipolar, borderline, ADHD, schizophrenia) and every last damn time the newest doctor would say that nothing was wrong with me (other than severe anxiety). That's it. By the time I was 18 I broke away from my parents to seek an independent opinion from a doctor they had no control over. I was told I didn't exhibit any signs of what I had been diagnosed with and the psychiatrist was pretty much floored that I was on such high level antipsychotics and other heavy meds when I had never in my history exhibited any signs of the behaviors that these medications treated. 

Starting when I was 9 they got on some weird kick about how I definitely had ADHD and got me on meds. When the doctor told them that I absolutely didn't have it and he wasn't going to prescribe meds any more we moved to another doctor. The next doctor said the same thing. Then the next. Then the next. You get the point. They would repeatedly take me to doctors to keep shoving pills down my throat. They also trained me to believe I was dangerous/violent/what have you and since they started when I was very young (9) I really had no other choice but to believe them other than some vague idea something was probably wrong with me. 

Now, as I look back on it and I learn more about parents with narcissism, gastlighting, and munchausen, I question if this was a particular weird form of munchausen. I know gaslighting typically isn't but my parents most definitely used this fake mental illness they induced in me to make me sick/sedated with pills and also to brag about how they were saints for raising such a difficult child. They were already well off/wealthy so they never gained anything monetarily from it but believe me did they ever get all the praise in the world for raising such a horribly dangerous daughter. 

**TL;DR: My parents used gaslighting on me from a young age to convince me I was mentally ill, shove pills down my throat to keep me sedated, and used all of this to brag to their friends about how great of people they were for taking care of a psychotic daughter so they could be praised. Is this a form of Munchausen?**",15May2017,3,

26,"Step mom and dad divorced last week ago actually , I felt very close to her during there marriage. Before the official divorce they just had a breakup that lasted 3 months, where she moved in with her daughter. She moved in with us RIGHT as soon as her and my dad started dating, this month last year.

Basically, she texted me yesterday saying "" hey sorry I was being weird the other day, it's just this was the 4th of this month last year that me and your father went on our first date and the first time I met you, I was getting sentimental. I replied saying "" no I understand, it's ok, are you sure you don't want no contact from me so you can recollect yourself? And don't worry about hurting my feelings I'd just rather know ""

She replied "" No babe your fine, maybe we can just touch basis once a week, or unless you have need someone to talk to about anything or something. "" In my mind I thought that was her distancing herself, yeah it was sad, because we usually texted more often like every 3 4 or 2 days or a few days in a row depending. So I texted her sure that sounds good, can we talk on the phone if you don't mind? "" I only asked that because I just wanted a clear understanding were to draw my boundaries.



I never got a response from, her, so after 2 hours I texted "" Hey I understand it's ok, you don't have to respond if you don't want to, I think maybe we should completely cut contact so you can heal completely, you don't need me causing a burden on you, it was a blessing knowing you, you have been very kind to me, staying in touch with me and checking on me and been a great mom figure to me. I just wanted to say bye, I hope you and your daughter stay safe, and I wish you happiness in life.



She texted me saying thank you, and I replied "" kick ass in life "" and she texted "" haha I should start with your fathers "" and I texted "" haha going to miss you. ""

I'm really torn up, it killed me inside to send that goodbye text, but I only said that because I thought she was trying to distance herself without wanting to hurt my feelings, I thought I was doing what she really wanted to do. I just never had a strong bond with anyone before. She taught me how to cook, and I remember me, her and my dad decorated the trees outside for Christmas, helped with my college process, cooked for me, me and her even got into any argument last year, because I was going through a lazy phase not working, or going to college and she cared enough to yell and fuss at me about it, and when I got into a physically fight and her and my father had to pick me up from jail, she got teary eyed and rubbed my face for a bit and gave me a hug. It really hurts remembering all these things knowing it'll never happen again. 




Today I texted her this "" hey I know yesterday I mentioned us completely cutting contact, but I just wanted to say that if you ever need or want to text or talk or anything, I'm here. If not thats cool to, its totally up to you. Take care. "" She responsded saying "" Thank you "" I replied "" No problem "", then she texts "" Me and your father have both moved on, but I will always be there for you "" I replied Thank you, and I want to be there for you as well. "" 







I remember right after the official divorce she texted me thanks for being there for me, I see you as one of my own, you're a great son to me, and I texted her no problem, you're a great mom to me to, thanks for still accepting me as a part of your life, and she texted "" always I promise "" We texted this right after the divorce, but I don't know if she still means that or not...



Two days after that I get a text from her out of the blue. She sends me a picture of  her new puppy that I haven't met yet, but ever since she bought him she'd always refer to him as my little brother and still does everytime she mentions him. Anyway she sends me a picture of the puppy sleeping and says he's been running around all day. I text back "" hahaha he's knocked out, I didn't think I was going to hear from you again, I'm glad to hear from you. She texted back "" That's still your little brother "" ( So I guess she's saying she still sees me as a son figure? )



 I texted back "" Well I'm glad to still have him as a brother and you as a mom figure, so how are you? "" She replied "" I'm good and you better be good to, I still expect you to keep up your chores every week, and continue to keep me posted on your therapy sessions and your college stuff. I texted back saying "" I definitely will and I'm going to still thump your head 43 times whenever I see you. She texted back "" I'm going to hold you to that.







Three days after that I text her telling her that I had a therapy session today, since she said to keep her up to date, and even before the divorce she'd always ask how it goes. Anyway she texted "" How was it""? I replied it was pretty good me and the Dr just talked about insecurities and a how to better handle a situation if I ever get frustrated "" She replied "" well I feel whenever you feel frustrated you should CLEAN YOUR ROOM AND BATHROOM "", then she sent another text with a bunch of laughing face emojis,  and then another one  saying cleaning is a good stress reliver, and I texted "" yeah I know, my bathroom and bed room look terrible now but I'll get to ut before the weekend. Then she texted "" Ok good you should just do it tomorrow. I texted saying I'd probably forget, then she said don't worry I got you, I'll remind you tomorrow. I made a joke saying I'd been having memory loss and that she'd have to remind me 20 times, and she texted saying "" Like I said I got you"" and put a laughing emoji.  I texted "" haha I miss you by the way and I hope your doing well, and she replied "" I'm great, going out to eat in an hour"" I texted back saying oh ok cool. 



Then I texted "" how my little bro doing and she replied saying "" he's spoiled as hell "", and I texted saying good, "" just what I like to hear "", and she texted saying that he ran off with her shoe and wouldn't come back inside the house "" then she sent another one saying "" he bit her finger because she wouldn't share food him, and I jokingly texted "" give him a treat I'm proud, and she replied "" He's a handful but hes got all my love "" and I replied saying "" He's lucky to have you as his mom "" and she replied  "" thanks hun, that means alot "" I then texted her a picture of how my sink looked as I hadn't had a chance to clean it due to an overload of college work. She replied "" Did someone break in your house and tear up your bathroom? 









That next day I get a text from her, jokingly spamming my inbox 6 times saying "" I'm reminding you now to clean up your room "" Then sends a bunch of funny emojis. When I texted her "" maybe later "" ( I was joking ) she replied "" Why wait? You're not working, get it done!! "" Then she told me to send her pictures of my room clean and everything.  




Day after that, I texted her after my college exam, and she asked "" How did we do? "" I made a joke about dropping out because the test was difficult  ( just playing ) and sell meth and she texted back "" I'll be your supplier  "" and laughed. Later that day she texts me a picture of her the dog sleeping on her daughters shoulder, and then sends me a recorded video of them playing. We texted a bit and she told me she was taking him to a restaurant so she could sit outside with him, and I texted "" Oh ok cool cool, I don't think I've eaten there before and she replied "" One day I'll take you, or maybe you and your father can go "" Then it went on from there, etc.


Three days after that ( today ) I wished her happy mothers day, and she texted back "" thanks babe, good morning. I reply "" No problem good morning "" Then a few minutes later  she says "" Enjoy your mom today ""  and I text back "" I will, same to you ""








This is the coflicting part, see I've had several people (  not including my mom, but including my dad ) in my life saying "" she cares about you, but she's probably going to want to move on eventually dude "" When I hear that it's discouraging, I'm thinking "" Then wtf doesn't she just do it now? Why did she reach out to me two days after I sent her that goodbye text, and tell me to keep her posted on my therapy and college? Why didn't she just cut contact when I said goodbye to her? Is she just texting me just to be polite? "" If she wants to go then she should just do that now, not drag me only to cut me off in the long run.  My dad told me "" women don't know what they want, you'll realize that in life "" See apart of me wants to just send her a text and tell her lets just stop talking and block her number, or apart of me wants to think of all the slightly annoying things she's done and find a reason to dislike her and ignore her. It's frustrating because I'm hearing that stuff from several people, yet she's still initiating text conversations. I just can't enjoy my relationship with her. I kinda think to myself "" I wish she just left so I can know that she's gone, rather than her still being in mylife and wondering if and when she's going to walk away, if that makes sense. 


I still kinda don't want to initiate any small talk with her, because I don't know if she still wants us to talk only once a week or not. Thanks guys.

28,"I know the daily dose of family love today, especially to all our mothers, but I can't seem to get a grasp on how I can live with my family and how they treat and flip sided it can be. There's no trust in me to do the right thing, it's always ""my fault"" for whatever argument or thing that happens. Plus a year back I got shipped out to a military school when my dad left. 

Alright so pre-military school it was actually kinda normal a bit, bipolar father, mother who was never home because of work, and a sister who was given everything and allowed to do whatever. (Although she didn't live.with us they paid for her housing and life which included tons of drugs) I was always on her shadow. Sounds kinda fucked but manageable. Anyways dad leaves because my mother kicks him out. She couldn't deal with the bipolar mess he is anymore. So it's just me and her around the last part of my freshman year in high school. We lived pretty well together, We got along well and didn't even fight then. Anyways summer comes and she says that I should go to military school, I go along with it to make her happy. I end up in a shaggy little hole called Marine Military Academy. I got straight A's always did what I had to do at the expense of my mental health. The kids there are horrible, I was bullied to the point of hiding in my room, and targeted by staff. Yet I stilled kissed ass and did what I had to do. I end up having a mental breakdown nearing the end of the year because of the constant bullying and harassment I got from everyone in my company. And all this bullying felt undeserved because I always try to be the nicest guy in the world to people. I needed out of it. 

Now everyone in my family told me that if I couldn't handle it I could leave. Well my mom, her new boyfriend told her that I was a spoiled little brat along with my sister and that the only way I would learn is if I'm forced to stay at that school. Every call I made home it was always me begging to not get sent back there next year or me begging to go home for a bit for a break, the backlash I'd get from her would always be ""how come you can't just listen to me and stay there, Devons kids listen to everything I tell them."" Anything among those lines. They pierced my skin. Oh I got that line and anything else her boyfriend had drilled inter her head every time I tried calling them begging to leave. Let me tell you this feeling of replacement burned so much, I hated and still hate being compared to drone like 9 year olds who will listen to anything because they can't think for themselves yet. 

The only way I was able to leave that place was when I had enough of all the bullying and harassment towards me and locked myself in my room for the day crying for the whole day. I had my phone because I had a 4.2 gpa and it was 3.0 liberty. And I just went off and called everyone I could, begging to leave. Grandma, Aunt, Mom, and Sister. I was begging saying these exact words ""I can't take it here I need to leave and not come back, everyone is a shit to me and the bullying just continues. I can't even feel safe in my own room here (I could hear the whole floors yelling at me through me door making fun of me) please for the love of god let me go home"" The only thing that got me to go home was my whole family grilling my mom about how much that place is scarring me. 

Anyways post-military school and I live with my mother again. Everything has changed. She still doesn't come home till really late but now, whenever she comes home it's just to yell at me for not respecting Or for never listening to her just constant straight to yelling out of nowhere. This would piss me off so I would yell back or just even give up and just not respond. She would constantly compare me to the boyfriends kids and say how good they are compared to me. I didn't understand it, I felt hurt and confused because all I ever did was stay home and clean the house for her all I did outside of that was go to my friends house or have him over. Even with my friend there the yelling happened. The only plus was still a minus because she'd just end off by saying ""Fuck you Devon was right about you, I'm going to Devon's"" Devon is the name of the boyfriend btw. The only plus is the yelling would stop, but I'd be alone. For days on end, she wouldn't even come back from work and yell, just straight to Devon's. I didn't know what to do. Everyday was the same. Even during the new year.

The lonely days of summer was over and the school year came. It always starts off the same with a lot of motivation and then it just dies out by the end. Although I have an x-factor when it comes to school. I can good grades like it's nothing if I just try a little bit. My hopeful self thought maybe if I got all A's for grades, my mom would treat me better. Man oh man... I have never been
so wrong in my life. I took whatever honor course and AP course I could take as a junior. Ended the half of the semester with all A's in every class. It didn't matter to her I was still not as good as Devon's kids I was still not good enough for her approval. She gave these little shits everything I didn't have as a child, her fucking attention. She was always gone when I was younger still. It was my dad who really raised me because then my mother didn't take weekends off and came home at 11 pm. Both my parents were working but my dad still found time for me, mother however, none. So when I see this 9 or 10 year olds, hell idk I don't care much for them, get all her attention get all her loving and she takes them out to Disneyland and six flags. All stuff I never got with her but wait my sister got to do all that with her. Of course I got jealous, but I never did anything to spite of it, the jealousy only just made me feel worthless. Like I wasn't enough. Now I love my sister, but couldn't care for those little shits. 

As far as I was concerned after that point nothing I could do could get approval so I told my self fuck it, I won't try anymore. I started hanging out with the wrong people, doing drugs, anything really to make me feel better. These guys took care of me, they became some of my best friends. They were bad people in their actions, gone to juvie, do tons of drugs. But they helped me. The first time you see a line of coke or any coke, you feel concerned kinda freaked out. I just was like ""yea I'll only smoke"" well smoking went to drinking and so on. Now it's not like that for everyone, but because of how I was, it's how it was for me. Now the first time I did coke was the first time I felt alive and happy in the months since I've been home I loved Coke. I'd do a gram or two every night getting the money from working odd jobs off cregslist or helping my friend steal something. It led me down this road. It was bad but it felt like the only way I could feel happy, it felt like I belonged with these people. After Coke I was willing to try whatever comes my way except heroin and meth. I went on a trap binge. Staying up for weeks at a time using Coke to stay awake. Then party all night off 4 bars of xanax and pass out for days at a time after. Molly and xanax on road trips to San Francisco. I was hanging a feeling that I'd only get from playing video games before. I was having so much fun I didn't want it to end. 

Now this way of life is really costly. To keep it up we went low. Very low. We would try anyway to steal stuff from stores like Nordstrom and Macy's to sell the clothes and then lick pounds of weed off some knocks that thought we actually had a couple grand. I did some bad shit. With that bad shit runs the risk of getting caught. And I got caught by my mom with $1200 dollars worth of True Religion jeans from a store with friends. I got away with it in a way, I got to keep the clothes. Cops never found out and I kept 3 pairs for myself to wear and sold off the rest. But now my moms aggressions and words towards me actually had truth to it and reason. And she jumped at the chance to kick me out and tell all our relatives why and just how much she was right. I lost so much credibility.

I ended up moving in with my sister in Santa Barbara. She helped me. I got straight got my grades back up got a job. Started playing video games again. I was going back to old normal me. I know I did this and the last part to myself and I only have me to blame for that. But at first it was good with my sister. But she's a partied with bad drug habits and tendencies. And when she was drunk it was bad, when she was high it was annoying and when she was high off something else it was good. These up and downs wore on me. But this was manageable. What wasn't was my grandparents going on my mothers side now saying how much I'm a brat and that I'm a bad person even ""horrible"" I litterally kissed there ass every time I saw them. They got all that from my mother and Devon because now Devon was talking to them about how much I stress and don't respect my mother. It hurts when your grandparents tell you that you are a bad person and you won't change and then they also say ""I don't like you"" that stinged the most. I was just getting my life on track, no drugs, getting good grades. What I needed was support. Only my sister was willing. She wasn't perfect but she helped. She helped until she couldn't any longer. To where it was taking a toll on her to have me around. I noticed. I noticed how much she got high more, went out more, how much I was alone more often. So I dove deeper into my video games and surfing. It just didn't help anymore. I turned 17 in February. Only person to say anything was her. Grandparents sent a card this month for my birthday 3 months ago. Better than nothing. I know I sound so entitled but everything just started to go so much more into shit. I was in my room now 16 hours a day, stopped surfing and only left or go to school. And then video games stopped working so I'd be just laying there on my bed 16 hours a day. Well that's no way to stay mentally healthy and I ended up attempting suicide by taking all my meds at one time. My sister called 911 when she saw me when she got home and I survived. I spent the last 2 weeks at the hospital and got out 2 days ago. I felt better for the 2 days and my mom even dame down for the month but now she's back to her old ways and threatening to go back early to Devon. Saying how she cancelled a trip to the Bahamas with him to come here. Now I'm feeling back to how I was before, yet I feel at fault and also don't.

I am a fellow male, 27, and I've run into a few posts on here about death instead of dating because of the fear. I think us men are better than that. We should be strong, confident and independent. We need to work on ourselves before we work on finding others. [I wrote an article about love](http://trevorcarss.com/love/) and I think we should all read it to get our lives on track.

38,"..but I was able to get out of bed and get into work for the first time in nearly a week and a half. 

I have been in a spiral of sleeping for 16hrs straight and then not sleeping for sometimes a day or longer during this time, I made some excuses for work about a random stomach bug because I'm not brave enough to tell them the truth. 

But even after laying awake for hours during the night, this morning I got up, had a shower and got to work. Deflecting the 'hope you're feeling better' comments, today is a struggle. How do you find ways to make down days better?

39,"When I was sixteen I was an exchange student overseas. I was at a beach party. Alcohol was involved and some stuff happened. One night we were all midnight swimming and we came back to my cabin. The friends I was rooming with were all in there and all asleep. My friend was locked out of his room and I had just taken a shower and let him in. (I was dressed.) Well, we went to lay down and he got on top of me and started thrusting, he took off his pants and stuff and tried moving me shorts and underwear out of the way. Eventually he did remove my shorts. I kept saying stop, I don't want to do this. He put his arms on top of mine, so I couldn't move. He kept thrusting and I tried moving my face to the side (he was kissing me forcefully) and he told me to just enjoy it. He wouldn't get off me and I started crying. Then he finally moved after a little while and I was shaking and had my back turned to him. He said sorry, but I was still scared of him.

I know I wasn't raped, this happened almost five years ago. After it happened I told a friend of mine. She said I shouldn't have put myself in the situation and that I was fine. So, I never talked about it again.  We were overseas so I felt alone. I had friends, but no real family and didn't know what to do, so I started restricting my food, it turned into an eating disorder I received treatment for years later and I've battled depression ever since. I'm just struggling with having a healthy sex life with my fiancé and I feel like it all comes back to this. I know I was sexually assaulted by an ex boyfriend, but I feel like I let him do it because I got tired of saying no. This incident haunts me the most though. I can't tell if I was assaulted or not. Was I? ",15May2017,1,

42,"My child will be turning 18 in about 8 weeks and has already made it clear they will continue to be therapy adverse and not take their prescribed meds.
This has been a battle that has been raging since they were a toddler ...we have been through so many diagnosis/miss diagnosis ,therapists, medicines,psychologists, psychiatrists,in patient facilities etc.
This has come to a head with my child wanting to move out before turning 18 and attempting to manipulate the situation at home to allow that to happen.
They 'self baker acted' and again made false allegations that were immediately recanted but still necessitated a DCF visit to our home(where younger siblings reside).
Child has done this in the past ,DCF is aware so that side of things is fine .
We ,however, can not allow child back into the home .
Thankfully a family member has child at their home until a bed opens up at a transitional facility child can stay at u til they turn 18 ...after that?
That's what I'm terrified of. 
My child is not healthy enough nor mature enough to be the adult they think they are and I'm very scared. 
Child was anti social up until this past year and fell in with a group of other troubled kids (more than a few who self medicate ).
I am so scared but have no idea what I can do .
They will be an adult and unless there's harm to self/others or criminal behavior my hands are tied .
Child has also threatened to ""disappear "" at 18 which is also heartbreaking .
Myself and my family are in therapy to cope with the affects this has had but therapy isn't enough to help unbreak my heart or stop my worrying. 
Has anybody else delt with this ?
I feel very alone .

46,"So, I'm mentally ill and it's been developing for about 4 years now, it started after I moved abroad. I faced some extreme discrimination here, and after years of this my head just, like, stepped halfway into a limbo, I guess this is the best way to put it. I have to dedicate a significant amount of my thoughts to intrusive thoughts, all of the time, it never stops, and it gets worse when I'm around big groups of people (I guess agoraphobia is independent, but it makes this worse), especially people of this nationality, it's like a PTSD. 

I've visited a psychologist here but they offered no real help, I went to a psychiatrist too, with the same outcome. Over the summer holiday I saw a psychiatrist in my country and it worked well, but we didn't have time to really discuss everything about my illness.

On 27th of June I'm flying back to my country, for good, but I have three math exams before then, and as much as I'm revising like crazy and can do most of the stuff without even thinking, on bad days when I'm around too many people I can just stop, for minutes at times, unable to think about anything, and I won't be able to even read an exam question in less than a couple of minutes if that happens.

Is there anything I can do about this on my own?",15May2017,10,

62,"(Disclaimer: I'm aware of how stopping meds without the help of a doctor can be dangerous and all the other problems it might cause. I'm not looking for more warnings on how this is a bad idea. I take full responsibility for my actions. I'm obviously not a doctor and I don't recommend anyone try this.)

I'm also not your typical case, I have fibromyalgia [which I had to figure out I had on my own] which I think is the main problem which has never really been addressed, despite seeing 4 different doctors. Although meds and doctors have been helpful in the past I think they are no longer helping me but ultimately hurting me.)

I recently lost a job. (not my fault, corporate reconstruction) I no longer have health insurance and without it, my meds will be $500-1000 a month. I've been using meds for so long and they have become a burden and ultimately something that is hindering my growth and freedom. I'm not able to leave the state or country, travel, see friends, etc and I'm sick of it. Meds have become a ball and chain that have kept me down for too long. Not only is it that I'm dependant on them, but I have no say in how I go about treating my issues or going through the health care process as a whole. I have to pay insurance, set up appts with a psychiatrist, see the psychiatrist, ask for meds; Then I have to go ask for a prescription to be filled, wait for them and pay for them to be filled. This has to be done three different times a month, once for each med. Not to mention it's thousands of dollars for the whole process and it has to be done every month, ad infinitum. 

I've become so disillusioned with the entire process and I'm refusing to go through with it anymore as a form of protest as well as out of pure spite. After just seeing my psych and then having Walgreens say 'we will have to contact your doctor to fill this prescription, and also it's going to be $175.' was the last straw.

I'm going to continue to take Wellbutrin as I do think it may be necessary at this point in time, however, I refuse to go through the aforementioned process for one little stupid med. I'm going to be ordering it online from Canada/India through one of the many sites where you can order prescription meds. This is not only much cheaper but also much easier as I just have to put in a credit card number and I can get 3 months worth at my door in a few weeks. Bam. 

I'm in the process of weaning off my other meds and at this point in time, I feel fine. I've been taking supplements that seem to address and help fix a lot of my issues. I have more energy, can think more clearly and my mood is better. It seemingly does a better job at addressing my issues than the meds I was prescribed as I feel they just cover up the problem and don't address it. 

Hopefully, this will be a way to get out from under the grossly dysfunctional health care system and allow me to better live the way I want to. ",15May2017,4,

67,"I have been aware of my mental health problem for quite a few years now. Last year, I hit rock bottom. In the span of 3 or 4 months, I was put into inpatient psych facilities 5 times, none of which I felt were helpful. I have been in some type of counseling almost all of the time since I was 18. I haven't gotten a solid diagnosis, or even discussion of diagnosis, from any of my providers. Not my therapist or my psychiatrist. Currently, I am on disability, because I mentally cannot handle working. I am on my states free health plan (masshealth, all i pay is a small copay for prescriptions), and that makes it very restricted in where I can go for counseling. Right now, I am at a community counseling center, but I'm not feeling very connected with my assigned counselor. All we do is talk about the time between this visit and the last. When she does give advice, either I try it multiple times and I dont find that it helps (in public), or I forget what it was. In terms of medications, i have been on and off so many medications that I can't name them all. Either I get no effect, or I have horrible side effects. My psychiatrist says that hes running out of ideas. I can hardly go into stores anymore, I have been constantly irritated and extremely short with everyone, I feel like everyone hates me. I have no drive to get anything done around the house. Please, advice would be great. ",15May2017,3,
