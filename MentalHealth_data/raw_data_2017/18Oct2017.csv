0,"Nice to meet you all, I’m Jack, I’m 19 years old and for a long time now feel as if I have been living with anxiety. I don’t feel in control of my life anymore and I don’t know what to do. I feel lost and pathetic. I’d just like to share my story with those of you who are interested. This could and probably will drag on a fair bit but I’m gonna just say how I feel and see where it goes. 


Through school, I’ve always been fairly popular. Both with the girls and the guys. My new life kicked off when I moved at the age of 12 to my new school, coming from where I came from I walked into the school with an arrogance, almost as if people should fear me and not disrespect me in any way. In many ways it helped me settle in, but I look back on that person now and cringe. I’m so much different to what I was back then. Back then I didn’t give a shit about much at all, looking at person in the wrong way, confrontation, having fights with people etc etc. I’d just brush it off like it never even happened. Now, I’m the complete opposite. I find myself obsessing over things I should/shouldn’t have done, thinking I may have looked at someone the wrong way or said the wrong thing to someone. I constantly seek reassurance, just to hear that I’m not fucking things up too bad. 
I can’t remember exactly when this started, but it was almost as if suddenly I became a whole different person. I feel small, as if everybody is better than me at everything. I feel like everybody is judging me or laughing at me for whatever reason. I constantly feel stupid, get flustered when doing the simplest of tasks and overthink every single thing I do in my life. 
Over the last year or so I’ve found myself revisiting old memories, mainly to do with moments of confrontation with people/fights with people. I then get myself in to a state of mind where despite these events taking place years and years ago in some instances, I start to get anxious, feeling as if these people are out to get me and will forever hold things against me. A good 90% of the time these thoughts have been so intrusive that I’ve had to message these people just to make sure we’re cool. I’ll panic when somebody unfollows me/doesn’t follow me back on social media, thinking why have they unfollowed me? Do they hate me? Are they out to get me? It’s just so stupid when I stand back and look at it, but I genuinely cannot get myself out of this mindset. 

May be important to add that last year I lost my Nan, of whom I was very close to. It all happened very fast and I feel as if I’ve not even began grieving yet. She was always my go to, she’d have answers to everything in life and was such a key person to have in my life. I rarely think about her, I feel so stuck in my own head and my own emotions that I’m not able to think about anything else. I feel myself unintentionally pushing family members away, I find it hard to talk to people without my brain going into overdrive about stupid shit. Life just seems so much harder than it used to be. 

I find myself getting sweaty and anxious even just going out to a shop or something, when talking to people I stutter and get nervous for no reason sometimes. I just seem to have lost myself completely. I have no real drive or determination to do anything. When doing simple things it’s like my brain is telling me I’m going to fuck up and do something stupid &amp; then I do. A lot of the times my hands shake, I feel weak and pathetic. 

I’ve also left home and am living with a couple of my friends now. I fell out with my mum’s partner and have moved to the city, away from all my family and friends. I still talk with most of them though. That being said, I feel as if I’ve become dependant on cocaine just to escape my intrusive thoughts and feelings. It started off me just doing it once and now it’s almost every weekend. If we try to get some but fail then it will piss me off to the point where I’ll sometimes go to bed or I’ll just be completely off all night. It’s like I need it just to be happy. 

Some days are better than others but I don’t want to sugar-coat it in any way. I know what I’m going through is not normal but I’d just like to know if there’s anybody whose going through or has been through the same. I feel like I’m wasting my life each and every day and I’m sick of it. 

I’m sorry if this has dragged on which I’m sure it has. It’s just once you start pouring your heart out a little bit it all seems to follow. I look forward to hearing from some of you guys. 

Take care, J x",18Oct2017,1
2,"Hi people,

I’m a 28 yo male and I have a fair bit of a drama in my life already. I am a young professional and in addition to everything else going on in my life which I won’t explain here I got another doozy.

I am from a small city and I recently had to goto a big city for some training. I saw a girl there and I guess I really fell for her. It is just a stupid crush. The problem is I am feeling very anxious and depressed she seems like a nice person and is married as I found out the same day (just came off mat leave)

I feel really bizarre I am going back to my city tomorrow and hopefully I’ll forget about this. I feel really restless weird alone and just been having panic attacks since I’ve been here. I am not sure how to deal with myself we are in the same company and different offices so I won’t be seeing her anytime soon or maybe at all. And that is causing a lot of anxiety as well.

Please help",18Oct2017,1
3,"The thing is, since medication has worked so well for them, and I have the same illness they have, would medication give me the same effect? I think my doctor did say something like that at one point, but I need clarification. I figure since the illness is hereditary, the response to treatment must be as well. Medication has worked well for my grandmother, and a lot of my Aunts and Uncles on that side of my family (all on my mothers’ side) who also so anxiety/OCD. I’ve been doing neurofeedback for about a month now and it hasn’t done much, so I’m looking at other options. I just want this stupid fucking illness gone. ",18Oct2017,1

5,"(Edit: added TL;DR at end)

Long time reader first time poster. I'm not really sure if this is even gonna see the light of the public but the rest of my friends are kinda clueless and Google isn't giving me what I want. 

For context of who I am in my mental health, I've been professional diagnosised with clinical depression for just under a year (been feeling it for about 6 years before diagnosis) and am on a daily dose of 20mg of Cipralex. 

Basically I've always had a really shit sense at holding onto reality. It's not a common occurrence but it happens regularly enough for me to remember. Basically I'll wake up sometimes and touch things around me, whether that be my physical self or my bed or something, and it doesn't feel real I guess. Like I touch it and I know that it's there and it's in physical existence but it doesn't feel the same as if would when I'm not having this feeling. It can also happen when I'm walking around but in terms of the mental feeling of being on the ground and waking I find that I'll go in chunks of time where I don't remember what I just did or I'll have to clarify to myself that I am walking to this destination for this reason and it is this time of day. 

I'm not sure if I've explained it to my full capacity because I'm not really sure what to make of it myself. I've explained it to my girlfriend and a few friends in my life just to see if they know anything about it and they haven't really been able to give me an answer about what it is either. It first happened about 5 years ago and it's what lead to me believing I was suffering from borderline personality disorder before my official diagnosis. 

In the past couple days I've been feeling it more often. I've been writing it off as a side effect of a bad weed trip I had a couple days ago when I took an edible and was the highest I've ever been in my life and I felt like I was having a seizure and was dying. My trip brought me back to a lot of childhood shit that I don't really want to get into but it's really fucked with my head over the past few days because of just how dark of a place my own mind brought me to. 

Is this a feeling that one of you has felt before? Do you any of you know what it's called or what it means about me mentally? And if you have felt it before, what do you do to ground yourself back into reality (without having to resort to what I have which is self harm)?

TL;DR: I have a sense of reality that tends to be shaky. Has been happening before but lately I've explained it to myself as side effect of bad weed trip. Anyone else experience this/have advice about dealing with it?",18Oct2017,1
6,"So I became emotionally involved with someone at work.They ended up cutting it off.However 3 weeks later , I still see said person everyday at work. I keep getting  thoughts(I miss her so much..etc) It's like,I can't do anything because it fucks with me mentally. I know,I shouldn't have done it,and I learned my lesson.

I've been trying to pursue my goals,but its hard to do anything when you're distracted mentally.I was thinking about just smashing an escort and maybe the thoughts would go away.I hate how weak,I let myself get.I'm working on getting my schedule changed. I haven't resorted to drugs...yet.

8,"My best friend has been on and off suicidal for a while. Im not sure as to the severity of these attempts, but every once and a while she'll ghost out, one of her other closer friends will get really concerned, and then a couple of days later shell show up to school completly normal. The only reason I know these are possibly suicide attempts was because after one of these episodes she made alot of sucide jokes, and, as we were in the middle of editing each others college admissions essays she kinda casually showed me the section of her suicide note dedicated to me.  
I think she might be getting alot more depressed agian, shes pissed at everyone in my friend group, including myself. Shes blocked everyone, refuses to talk to me in class, and has locked me out of our locker. (we share it because of shitty high school) I asked her why and we somehow got into an arguemnt about the fact that we fake divorced on facebook (we were ""married"" before, it was kinda stupid) I had no fucking clue if she was serious or not, shes a terrible liar.  
im terrible with emotions, and besides shes ignoring me so theres no point in talking it out. Our guidance counslier is very useless, and I dont want to do anything that would land her in a psych ward, that shit only fucks people up further. What the hell am I supposed to do",18Oct2017,0
10,"just gonna jump into it

USA

I've been seeing therapists and psychiatrists on-off for more than a decade. Depression/anxiety. Never really made any progress. I'm almost 30 and my life, just me in general, feels irreparable. 

Never went back to college, kept flunking out of community. Never got a skilled job. Never found meaning, no hobbies, no friends. I go to work and sleep. Days I don't work, I just feel confused. I'll go for a walk, and get nothing out of it. I'll take up drawing or music, like I used to enjoy as a kid, get nothing out of it. I have never completed a personal project my entire life.

Now I'm hearing voices. Usually at night. I like hearing them because it breaks up the monotony. I'll isolate myself and not leave my house for days so I can enter the fucked up mental state that usually brings them on.

I could go on forever, so a constructive question: who do I need to talk to for help. Therapists I've seen seem almost bewildered when I just kind of let loose with these thoughts. They get the unfiltered improvised version so it sounds even crazier than what I've typed here. And I get stuff like ""You should buy a sketchbook since you like drawing! Join a club. Here are some breathing exercises"". Been there tried that. 

I barely feel human anymore and people don't look like people to me.

Long story short, I think I've already lost my mind and I think I'm beyond therapy. Where can I go.",18Oct2017,2
11,"I have had a history of depression/anxiety, and one thing I have noticed is that I just can't break cycles of negative thoughts, especially at work.

16,"Help. Over the past 5 years I've had mild depression, on and off. Over about 3 months I've said maybe 4 sentences to 2 people who used to be my closest friends, one of whom is my crush for 2 1/2 years. I fucked up everything I've had between us. They've been some of my closest friends for about 3 years. And I hated it that she barely talked to me individually, only on group skype chats and in groups when we were out places. I hated how they would have conversations without me. I hate that I took relationship advice from my other friend who said don't go out with any of your friends. Cause I know she used to like me and now I know she doesn't. And a few weeks ago I spoke to her and told her how I feel about her, how I lie awake almost every night thinking about her, how I hate not being able to talk to her, how much I miss having them as friends.

After I talked to them about pretty much ignoring me half the time they denied it but kept doing it. So flipped out cause it was all too much. I told them to fuck off and that I didn't want to speak to them anymore. So they didn't. But after around 3 months I apologised and said what I said above. 

Since then, neither of them want to talk to me. We have 2 classes together and during the one we had today she sat on the other side of the table as far away as possible because it was the only table left. The other person clearly didn't want to even associate himself with me. He looked at her and tried to get her to move so that he wouldn't have to sit next to me. Both of them barely acknowledge that I exist. I hate it and nothing I've done has helped. Only made it worse. I think about ending it almost every single day now because of it. My social life has greatly declined over the past 6 months and I've just left school for the whole day at one point to try take my mind off it. But it didn't work.

And now this is where I've got to. Posting on the internet for help. And yeah I should see a counsellor but they won't help, they never have helped me. I have spoken to other friends about it and they are being extremely supportive but it still hasn't helped. Help.

17,"Lately as my depression has been making a comeback I've been having some really dark and disturbing fantasies. I feel like I have a psychotic episode coming and as fucked up as it sounds this time I'm kinda hoping for it. I suffer from Schizotypal Personality Disorder and dark thoughts and fantasies aren't anything new to me. I'm just tired of trying to fit into society. I want to suffer a psychotic breakdown and really hurt someone. I want to commit something terrible and just see if I can get away with it and for how long. I just don't care anymore. That said I'm not sadistic. I don't want to kill or hurt someone for the sake of their pain, but I'm starting to feel indifferent towards it. I just want to cut contact with everyone, and do whatever my twisted mind can come up with.

31,"I am 25 years old and diagnosed as schizoaffective/bipolar. I am on a mission to ditch cigarettes for good... a lot easier said than done. 

I first started smoking (on a regular basis) at the age of 19 (the legal smoking age here in Canada). It began as a social thing but soon became my go-to coping mechanism. I smoked to deal with stress, anxiety &amp; depression. Later at the age of 23 I would experience my first psychotic episode. In my psychotic state I very truly and literally believed that without a cigarette every hour I was going to drop dead. It was terrifying and I smoked more and more in the time that followed. Then at the age of 24 I felt the best I had in my life in terms of my mental health but feared that if I quit smoking I would digress back into the stress, anxiety, depression &amp; abnormal thoughts that I turned to cigarettes to negate. Now I am 25 and have come to realize -by way of observing my aunt who is suffering with end-stage COPD- that these cigarettes I have turned to to “help” me all these years are in fact slowly but surely killing me. 

I first started my journey to quit 2 years ago when I purchased my first e-cigarette. After over a year of trying with no progress I managed to cut myself down to just 3 cigarettes a day (for one full week) by switching to vaping. I soon realized that I was simply swapping one addiction for another and this time (my 5th attempt) I am on a mission to live addiction free. 

Two weeks ago I was smoking 30+ cigarettes a day. Today I am down to ~8. This seems like a lot for those who don’t smoke but for me it is a huge deal. I have to find something to do with my day besides smoke and am finding new coping mechanisms and pass-times. And guess what! I am OKAY. My thoughts are still my own. I am not overwhelmed by stress or anxiety, I am even becoming a much more productive person.

I am using nicotine replacement therapy (patches and gum), provided for free by a government funded program(the S.T.O.P. Study available to residents of Ontario, Canada through various organizations including public health units and community health centres), to prevent withdrawal symptoms and am aiming to be cigarette free by November 1st. 

Quitting smoking is a huge milestone for me and is a great indicator of how far I have come in terms of my mental health.

Klonopin is the latest. I was taking 2mg 2x daily for about a year. Since April of this year I began to cut back on the Klonopin because it's no longer effective for me and I don't like how dependant my body has become on taking it just to get by.  Withdrawal has mostly been kept at Bay by cutting it slowly. I began tapering in April and dropped about .5mg a month. I am down to .5mg a day and unable to stop the last bit. I can go about 2 days without a dose but then withdrawal hits hards. I vomit all morning, shake/tremble, can't sleep, and my skin just feels like it is infested with bugs.

It was hard watching him try and save jews in our hallway by making it over the border from germany.  When i went to see why he was yelling he thought i was a nazi until he snapped out of it.

EDIT: will clarify that my dad seems otherwise ok when he is sober,  He has said things like "" He hangs out with kid rock and stuff""  and has explained it like this.  ""he knows these things aren't real, but they happened"".. gives me the impression that when he is sober he is in enough control of his mind to tell what is real and fake but the memories still remain.  Hence why he can hold down such a good job.  


Well, I have been having some strange things happen to me as well.  Lately i can't shake the thought from my mind that when I think i'm talking to myself in my head that i'm actually saying it out loud and my brain stops me from being able to recognize this.  Example.  Today i was working and a lady bent over and i thought ""damn she got a big ass, like REALLY big"".  Then out of nowhere i heard another guy say .  ""If i said that I would get smacked across the face..HARD"".   Now it was a loud room and i was to busy to actually confront the guy to see what he was talking about. either 3 things here.  

1. He didn't even say anything remotely like that and my brain just ""filled"" in what I thought.  

2. He did say those things but the timing was perfect and he was talking about something else.

3.I was really saying it out loud and i have some sort of ""disorder"" that no one wants to confront me about.

I think the fact that i'm open to other possibilities makes it such that I am not delusional yet.

However, this is just one instance.  I have so many more that I can back it up with and think ""huh that was fucking weird"" and ""WTF just happened, oh well better not think on it too much"" ...  But today  just made me go..OK what is happening. 

Am i going crazy?  Am i actually disabled and no one has the heart to tell me?  Am I jumping in between dimensions where i actually said what i was thinking?  Am i getting a little delusional like my father?    Or am i looking for things that aren't there?  lmao .. idk .. you tell me guys?

One thing that stood out to me was that almost all the people that had anger as symptoms of depression were men. It was one of the theories as to why depression might be harder to diagnose in men than in women because anger isn't the first thing one thinks of when you think of depression.

Why is this so?

Do men use anger as a cover up emotion in order to avoid feeling unworthy or do they process depression differently on a biological level?

The mod banished people with BPD to make it a safe space for he/she to trash talk their mentally ill parents and attack and ban anyone who is even slightly critical of their thought process. The mod absolutley displays every symptom of the condition they criticize so much in the attempt to create a echo chamber of people who think reliving their disturbing past to get off on the thrill of being offended will somehow clear their consciousness of negativity. As someone who cares about the sanctity of life and honestly to some extent, fuck that hellhole-in-a-wall. ",18Oct2017,33
48,"I'll keep this short since I could go on and on but who cares right

Why don't i want anything? Like, anything at all?

i dont want a job or a career  
i dont want to get fit and healthy or strong  
i dont want to have a girlfriend, family, kids  
i dont want to have sex  
i dont want to have friends  
i dont want to travel the world and see new place  
i dont want to make anything or build anything  
i dont want anything and thus i just exist  
i dont want to live but i dont want to kill myself so i just continue on, the days go by and my life gets steadily worse and worse and suddenly im 24 years old having spent the last 8 years thinking i'd kill myself next year

This doesn't seem right",18Oct2017,1
49,"Basically, how can I turn from being an ENFP into an emotionless 'machine', so to speak. 

My father abused me because I was bad. I don't remember my childhood. My mother blames me for why she divorced my father and why the family never speaks to us. 

I'm 24 and I still feel the urge to make art, get involved in 'fun' activities, create things, and play Mario. I also have that childlike hyperness and optimism that I honestly, cannot even control and my mother thinks I am stupid because of that. I want to get a job in law enforcement (namely, punishing criminals) since art is just pointless and pathetic and is not a proper job. 

I feel this inner child thing is making me weak. For example when my best friend was murdered in 2013, I cried for two days straight. That is not acceptable. I want to actually be tough, than cave into poppycock emotions like a manchild. Sometimes I try to lowkey bully people into hiding their stupid emotions and then I feel good when they get upset, but that idiotic inner child soon kicks in and starts apologizing to them and acting all calm and nice. 

Also I find that tricyclic antidepressants (ESPECIALLY amitryptiline) tend to exaggerate it. ",18Oct2017,0
