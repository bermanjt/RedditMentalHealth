1,"I've never sought any sort of mental help; the thoughts and issues I have are very minor relative to the tough hands a lot of people are dealt. I am aware of this, and because I don't want to feel bad for myself, I don't really ever address thoughts that I've had for years on end. Perhaps most of you feel this way, but no one talks about it.

I'm not sure how many of you maintain standard professions without losing your minds. I've been ""successful"" (as far as how society typically defines it) in a couple different areas - I'm a software engineer for a top 5 tech company, I trade on the side (and beat the S&amp;P). I work out and keep myself in shape. Most people from the outside would say I have a lot of friends, but the truth is I don't consider many ""close"" - and many of those ""close"" are childhood/university friends. I've had difficulty developing close friendships in the 15 years since then. Most people you ask about me would consider me an optimist, but that becomes more difficult by the year. I honestly feel a bit isolated and like I don't fit in; I've tried to get involved in different activity groups, it just hasn't been successful. I would like to think I give off a laid back, mostly optimistic vibe, but I just don't connect to people. 

Instead of addressing the core issues that I perceive, I've found myself turning more and more toward behaviors that aren't typical of me (drugs, sex with randoms) as a bandaid. But even those are cool for a couple times, then it's boring. Because of my profession, I'm analytical in nature - but I'm really struggling with analyzing myself.

Any advice? Do a lot of you feel this way? Is there something that I'm missing? I did have a buddy die on me while we were out 2 years ago, and my Father, who I'm close with, is in bad health. But these thoughts have been consistent since long before both events, so I believe they are unrelated. Please, before you tell me to suck it up, realize I've been doing this for 10 years. Nothing has changed. Thanks in advance for any thoughts/advice.",29Nov2017,3
2,"After work, I already feel so mentally exhausted that it’s hard for me to feel motivated enough to read or write, even though those are two of my favorite activities. I usually end up aimlessly browsing social media or watching Netflix for hours, then I just feel bad about myself.

3,"Hi there,

One of my many difficult, repetitive experiences in this life is that I am constantly stressed by all of the things on my ""to-do"" list, i.e- all of the ""shoulds"" and really struggle to be able to give myself a break, even if I'm doing the best that *I* can
Probably because I *could* do a lot more with my time. I spend a lot of time depressed, and frittering away precious time in escapism, BUT I also do a lot with my time.

I'm working two jobs, going to AA meetings, working the steps (could do better on that front I suppose), NOT DRINKING, working out regularly and intensely (for the most part), cooking often, always striving to clean more and take care of all those little to-do list items (take out the recycling, tidy room, laundry) instead of letting them linger...but...it's....never...good...enough

For example, sure, I workout and have for 15 years! That's better than most people, right? I *should* feel good about myself!

But, the perfectionism won't let me get away that easy.

Even though I'm depressed, alcoholic, anxious, traumatized, etc etc etc and just having the time and energy and opportunity to work out is awesome. Here is a snapshot of the mental craziness around one aspect of my life in which perfectionism, depression, and shame rear their ugly head every day, THE GYM! (also sometimes the outdoor calisthenics park):

1) Am not focusing enough on results/outcomes/quality of my workouts/consistent progress

2) My nutrition is always wavering back and forth, healthy unhealthy, PLUS with everything I ""know"" about nutrition, I've figured out a way to feel bad about almost anything I put in my mouth, even the time at which I do it. So much stress over the mere act of eating! Am I bulking? Cutting? Why does it matter? Can't I just eat? Well am I eating enough? Not enough? What are my ""goals"" anyway? I can't stick to ""goals"" with stuff like this long term anyway, what's the point. I *should* just gut it out, ""DO IT"", all that, because that's the only way I'll improve....but...I...just...can't...even though I have in spurts, overall, it's as if this beast of ""I CAN'T"" just wants to drag me back down to hell, every damn time

3) WHAT IF ONE DAY I GET INJURED OR LOSE ACCESS TO A GYM AND CANT WORKOUT THEN IT WILL ALL BE FOR NAUGHT WHATS THE POINT (I know that I don't need a gym to workout out and that it's the journey and how I feel NOW and not the destination that matters, I didn't say this shit was rational)

4) I'm always so damned lethargic and depressed that just getting through the workout has been a nightmare for almost all of those 15 years. I've switched it up so it's more fun, found workout partners for motivation, everything, and even though I can still work some voodoo on myself to get to the gym and get going, without fail, it's as I've got a 1,000 LB weight vest on while I'm doing those burpees, and a crowd of critics judging EVERY SINGLE REP.

5) I'm not warming up well enough, not stretching enough, not doing enough core and leg work...just do it at home! Just carve out a few minutes each day to do it! Just do this! Just do that! Why do I suck so bad that I can't ""Just"" do better on all the fronts on which I feel so bad about?

I know, it's about continual improvement...but I feel like I'm continually stagnant no matter what...

The shame and ""can't do it"" seem to just grow stronger, even when I'm actually ""Just doing it""..

And this is just what it's like for me to go to the gym...

This kind of convoluted, confusing, heavy nonsense pollutes every corner of my life. 

As I said, I do a lot. I am challenging myself on many fronts as often as possible. But it's never good enough for me, and rarely good enough for the world. What I mean by that is; I'm forgetful, tired, easily stressed, and often sad, but sometimes manicly happy...how do you think the world responds to this attractive array of characteristics?
I'll give you a hint: They mock and dislike me for it, even though I'm giving 100% of what I have...or am I? It sure as shit feels like I am giving 100%...but I'm sure i could do better...but how can I manage that knowledge that i can and should do better, with the reality that too much ""shoulding"" on myself pushes me to the edge of severe depression and exasperation QUICKLY.


People say things like: give yourself a break, be nice to yourself, don't listen to other people....which are nice and all, but make me kinda angry because obviously I *should* just do those things, but how? How? How?!

Any insight?",29Nov2017,20
4,"Something bad, really bad happened. I moved. I ran really far away to another state, using another name, trying to lay low so nobody found me. I don't want to go back to my old life. I'm afraid that they will find me. I haven't met any friends here because I'm scared to leave the house. Should I have even left? At least I had friends there.

6,"Lately I've been in a mental and emotional rut. It feels like it has been going on for about 2 months now. Its just been a constant roller coaster from having either too many or too severe emotions to the opposite end of the spectrum, and having none what so ever. It comes in episodes that can last days or even just hours. Everything from depression, anxiety, confusion to anger and even good things like happiness. But it ends up making sense to me. I've also felt incredibly lonely, but also not wanting to be near people at the same time. It makes do logical sense to me. I have a loving fianceé who has been with me through bouts of my depression and anxiety. I feel awful for making her deal with this. So what things can I do to try and get out of this?",29Nov2017,1
7,"I never used to be afraid of death. I grew up just not even thinking it, and by the time I hit university, I'd fallen into depression, and eventually a suicide attempt. I got better for sure, and went on several different anti-depressants and kept steady work. I also picked up a very unhealthy drinking habit, eventually getting drunk twice a day when I could, yet still staying sober just long enough to work a short shift. 

I spent my twenties this way. I'm twenty-nine now, and still struggling with my alcoholism. It's taken numerous tolls on my body, and especially my mind. My memory is largely gone, and yet I still struggled to care about anything. My life was what it was. 

A few days ago, I was sitting on my bed and watching some stupid thing on tv, I can't even remember what was on. But I was suddenly stricken with an incredible fear of death. I felt it in my chest, and I could feel myself almost panicking. It was so bizarre because I sort of felt like two people. I had one side of me, which felt the same as always, and the second me, which was on the verge of losing it.

Its been a while now, a couple days, and I'm still incredibly nervous and find myself thinking of death and being incredibly scared. Its not as severe as the first sudden burst, but still makes me panicky and anxious. 

Does anyone have any idea what happened to me? Or how to undo it? I feel really weird venting all this, but I figured it's my best bet at anonymously getting input from a wide range of people. 

Hope you're having a nice day, thanks for your time. ",29Nov2017,4

9,"I think I have some sort of OCD and anxiety disorder, but don't know why it is flaring up all of a sudden? I have this weird thing that happens whenever I go to bed, I make sure the faucet is off in the bathroom 5-10 times before I am able to fall asleep. Then I get upset at myself that is now 12-1am, and I have to be up in 6 hours for school, and cry/get stressed, and don't fall asleep till whenever (2-3am). I sometimes think about harming people, specifically parents and my pets, and start crying/freaking out because I don't actually want to do this, and I am very scared of these thoughts. I don't want to act out on these thoughts and I want them to go away. I would never act out on these thoughts in a sane state of mind.

For the past 6-7 months, also, I have felt a state of constant nostalgia, for better times in my life. I have a really good memory, so these times in my life are extra vivid. I would go back to these times if I could. (October 2014-May 2015). I wouldn't say I am a super depressed person. Generally pretty happy I guess. Nothing really wrong with my life. I have great parents that are supportive, my own car, a job, volunteer gig and some clubs at school. My future really stresses me out though, since I kinda fucked my GPA last year, and I am nervous for what is going to come out of my highschool/college career.

I need help, mainly with the OCD/Aggressive compulsive thoughts. Can't really describe what is happening and haven't told anyone that I know. Need your input, and possibly options for treatment/therapy.

12,"I'm not usually the kind of person to do this, and I by no means should be in the situation to do this - I'm in high school.  But however, I can't help it.  Something must be different.  Just now, I listened to a song I saved to my playlist in 9th grade. I'm just a junior.  Two years is nothing in an adult's life, but as I'm younger, and I feel time is relative to your age, this seems like an incredibly long time ago.  I don't know why.  It was the same high school, I still know/talk to a lot of the people I did then, and to be honest, 2015 was one of my worst years, I had terrible financial and family issues with the anxiety of going to a new school.  However, I can't help but reminisce about how much I miss those times.  It was terrible, but to be honest, it was probably better than what I'm going through now.  I don't like pity partying, but I realistically think that life is just going to get worse and worse, and that I regret disliking past experiences, as I should treasure them.  This leads to a never-ending cycle of doubt and frustration.  This post is being written in the middle of this cycle.  That one song made me think about memories just two years ago, yet that makes me lose comprehension of how fast time seems to be going, and how I want to re-live that time period, even if i was bad, just to get away from my life today.  I constantly lie to myself on the topic of time.  I under-exaggerate times.  Hell, I find myself referring to 2017 as 2015.  There is no real way for me to comprehend the past, however short it may be.  Days are ruined with this, this happens about once every other day.  I cannot stop thinking about it and stay up at nights thinking about what I should've, could've and would've.  I literally can't think about anything that was in the past, even as short as 3 months ago to 8 years without me constantly telling myself to relive it doing something else.  Every time I think of this, I get into a huge slump and lose focus, motivation, happiness, and overall just zone out in a fit of self-hate and frustration.  I don't know if this is normal, or I'm just not handling adversity the way one should, or if something is actually wrong.  Sorry if this is so long and unorganized, I just don't know how to put it into words.

14,"""L'appel du vide"" is that sensation when you are at the edge of a cliff and you wonder what it would be like to jump.

I am depressed. I have been in a pretty constant state of depression for 5-7 years. I didn't handle my grandmother's death well, it cost me my job and eventually my marriage/the only relationship I have ever been in (high school sweethearts). I am not handling my seperation well (she has her own issues and ended up going missing/homeless/jail/mental hospital in another state). We tried working i out but we couldn't. Would be easier if we hated eachother or if there was anger, but there is nothing but love and wanting the best for the other and knowing that we dont work together.

I actually have reached a point where I accept that and so that pain of loss has lessened but being single doesn't fit me. I ended up losing all of my friends over the past few years and the few I have made are homebody loners like me so its not like we really do anything together.

I don't sleep. I live at home again to help take some of the financial burden off my parents at take care of my grandpa. He doesn't have long. I stay up at night to listen for him if he falls or needs something. I will go to bed about an hour before the rest of t he household gets up and then be up a few hours later to run errands, pick up my nephew from school, whatever my mom can't do because of whatever she needs to do for my grandpa.

I have tried only a couple times to date since me and my wife first separated. Once was during her breakdown and she called me from the hospital while I was on the date (she didn't know, still doesn't) because she thought that the janitor was trying to kill her. When I saw it was her calling I couldn't just let it go to voicemail. He family 
 and friends abandoned her because they didn't understand that she didn't abandon them, that she snapped and thought the only solution was to run away. The girl I was on the date with understood my situation, was ok with it, until she realized that she wasn't (she was amazingly honest about it, that she was surprised that she couldn't be more understanding). We left things on good terms and she said that she hoped we met again when things were different. I was hesitant to start dating because I still felt an obligation to this person who was my best friend and  I had married. Its baggage I didn't want to burden anyone with but now she is in a stable place, we gave our relationship another try, and we are both on the same page that it doesn't work between us (no matter how much we care about each other or how good the sex is). So I'm ready...but I don't have the energy, mentally or physically.

And then there is l'appel du vide. Right now I do not feel it. I am not suicidal (as far as I am aware) but when I'm driving or near a ledge that thought/sensation is often. I only ever felt it on rare occasions in the past. Once now and then, but now it is every time I drive, sometimes multiple times. On my way too and from work there is an incline in the road where it goes over a large ditch/railroad tracks. there is a guardrail at its peak but plenty of room before that to drive off road and fall into the ditch. Or the thought of turning sharply into the divider on the highway. Or jumping when I am on the ledge.

I am afraid that it is suicidal in nature even though I do not feel this way when the triggering stimuli isn't around. Because I don't feel like ending my life, more the ""what if"" of the dangerous situation, I really don't think its suicide related.

I also suffer from a lot of anxiety and I wonder if it is some sort of crossing in the fight or flight reactions.",29Nov2017,2
15,"each day is consumed with my thoughts, not a moment goes by i dont think of just ending it. every convo feels fake. i put on a fake persona for my family, my friends, my job, school, hook ups. All areas have a different facade. Nobody really knows me. then again i dont even know myself.



mental health has gotten so bad I cant even talk to most ppl. never had more then one word convos with my roommates, co workers or classmates.




most ppl spent college partying/hooking up/finding themselves. I spent it drowning myself in work to avoid facing reality. I spent it socially isolating myself.




Should be happy having a well off family, nice car, money in my bank, great (but little) friends, good job, great vacations. Instead I am numb to the point I cant cry. I just go through the motions day to day. I should of sought help years ago but instead I let issues take my late teen years and early twenties away from me. At 22 I feel life is pointless. Spend my days getting drunk and smoking.

Lately (past half year or so) I've also been noticing an increased tendency and ability to recall things from the distant past, lots of mundane stuff, but I'm pretty sure I could tell you who sat where at the table at family dinners, what the weather was, and what we ate. It's gotten to the point that I feel like I could probably reconstruct my entire life if I wanted to. I guess in some ways this is awesome, but definitely feels kind of weird.",29Nov2017,1
17,"I have been dealing with depression and anxiety depression for a long time but never really acknowledged i had this problem till recently. i think i may have a personalty disorder but not sure if this is just me over thinking this. sorry for the spelling and grammar errors i am terrible at writing. 

- when around people i dont know in a social setting i feel like people are judging my every move 

- this makes me overthink everything i say always thinking about how i am coming across to the other person

- when im with my friends it not as much of a problem and i can talk without thinking about what im gonna say first

- i do have a good amount of friend i would consider close but all of them are either friend form early childhood or people who became friends with my friend and over time i become more conformable around them.

- every other friend i have made is either someone who lives close to me in my dorm or people who where in the same reasorce room classes as me throught hs

- i am not able to talk about my feeling or anything intimate with anyone and freeze up when i do.

- i cant let other people know that there criticism bothered me even if i agree with it i will continue to ignore it so they dont think i care about there opinion

- i cant say i love u to anyone including parents and feel very unconformable when people show feeling for me like hug.

- i am very unorganized and cant plan for future like what major i want to do. i cant even begin to think about a realistic future for my self and dont understand how people know what they want to do for the rest of there lives

- i am not sure i care about anyone else. when my grandfather was hospitalized my parent txted me and my brothers and they immediately responded with sadness and question and all i was thinking about was how to respond without seeming weird. i dont think i even cared

- same thing when my dog was hit by care my whole family was either crying or very angry but i was just annoyed that i was missing a prior plan i had.   

- went fair away to college and do not miss anyone and get annoyed when friend and family message or call me. when i went home for thanksgiving though i felt the same way about my new friend here

- i very often think about either having some type of special power or just having power in general. this is the only time i actually can think about the future. 

- i feel like everyone else is naive and biased and i have very unique political/societal views. i feel like people just dont care about facts

- it annoys me how people worry so much about everything i feel like things will always work there way out.

- i make dections in the moment knowing that it will make thing harder latter i just dont care. (i do have adhd which i know probaly reason for this)

- while somtimes i will get really imitated and snap on someone real quick. with that said its not to often and that the only time i really get mad.

- i smoke weed and drive alot. i was caught by the cops and told my self i would never drive with weed in car again. a couple day latter i was driving with weed in car.

- i did take the blaim for the arrest sparing my friend. with that said when i did take blaim the only thing going through my head was how he was going to owe me big time.

- i really did not care about the arrest i just did not want to talk about it with parent because i hate when people act like i did something wrong. i always have hated authority since i was kid.

- while i feel like a show a lot of signs of aspd i also feel like i dont act like people with the disorder. 

- people for the most part will tell you im very polite and kind person. i never try to personally hurt anyone  physically or emotionally and while im not sure if my attentions are ""moral"" i do think i am a kinder person then most.

- i just dont like being told what to do or judged so i dont judge or tell other people what to do unless they are doing so to me. i think if you are good to other people they will be good to you.

- not sure if this is important at all but on iq test i scored in 99 percentile in similarities and 91 in matrix reasoning but 34 in written expression   

- also i tell small lies alot that normally cant be verified not so to impress people but to avoid admitting things that embaress me

- i also talk about how much smarter a am then everyone else in a very sarcastic and joking around way but i do believe it. i also claim to be god or the messiah which i dont bealive i just say in a sarcastic way and have for years.

- and i argue alot with people not out of anger allthough it does annoy people sometime. i just enjoy debating things with people and if someone comes up with good evidence of why i am wrong i will eventually admit i am wrong.( dont feel like im wrong often though)

18,"Pretty much the whole story is in the title. I have had PTSD for many years, and it has been under control with minimal nightmares, flashbacks, anxiety attacks, agoraphobia for a good while now. Every so often something will happen or I will be too near someone who trips It Off. For instance, I have an ex who is a registered sex offender. While he did at one time offend to me? With me? Whatever. I am not the reason that he is a registered sex offender. The fact that he is though, and the fact that he did assault me, and possibly because there is, to this day, and indent in his living room wall where my head got shoved into it, anytime I see or hear from him I am bound to have an anxiety attack. Things like that makes sense. But I started immediately having flashbacks and anxiety attacks the second I heard that my best friend had been assaulted by a completely random stranger in a completely random place before I knew a single detail about it. And I don't know what to do about it. I want to be there for, and I want to do everything that I can to take care of her, but just being around her while she's panicking is making me so much worse.

I know the psychiatrist is focusing on my past, specifically how my mom's (who has bipolar disorder that went untreated for most of my life) affected me and how that shaped how I act and react to things today. I really appreciate this since the last psychiatrist I went to focused on my symptoms and immediately prescribed me mood stabilizers and antipsychotics (this might be why it's bugging me so much about not knowing if I have a disorder or not). Is it okay for me to just ask? Or would he tell me if he felt like I had a disorder?

21,"There is perfectionism and maladaptive perfectionism 

Maladaptive perfectionism is a mentality I don't know , is it a personality ?, 

It could be illustrated for example where  you set yourself unattainable goals  putting your physical and mental health In danger .all the while harshly criticising yourself throughout .

For sure I have this issue , I know why ADHD and a chaotic dysfunctional family upbringing . Ie emotional abuse from mentally unstable family member from around the age of 4 to 20

My sibling has had the same impact from our upbringing expect , doesn't show it the same way i do.

I never stop with this mentality , when I exercise I don't just go for a run, I go for 120 miles over the course of a  week and can keep this up week after week until i get adrenal fatigue or when I go hiking I walk until it's pitch black when others would want to head home long ago . At first I never really acknowledged this behaviour 

 this leaks out all over  my life, with work , my job satisfaction is never sustainable because I feel the need to produce more than is needed and I burn out, i focus on too much instead of pacing myself and enjoying myself as others do.

When it comes to exercise  I enjoy it but have since taken it down a notch as that level of physicalality is not sustainable.

But I realise now that that  behaviour and is probably driven as result of this mentality and that nothing is good enough

Anyone deal with this shit ,I myt have a pretty bad case of it.

 at least I realise I have a problem ,  I need to know how I can approach things differently?

24,"Hiya, I seem to be in need of some guidance. I have a friend I believe I’m codependent on, but as of it today, I learned what ‘codependency’ is. I was looking at the various questions and questions and thought this may finally be what has been going on with my life. In previous years, I made my first best friend, but it ended rather quickly. Into a year into our friend everything was great. We were always on good terms, always talked throughout the day, and played video games together if time was available. But the second half of the friendship is where it went down hill. I went into an extremely dark place that resulted in the end of the friendship. I became dependent on this friend for my happiness and looking back it was beyond terrible for me and my friend. Neither me or my friend deserved any of it and it’s quite the burden that I carry everyday thinking about it. But currently I believe I’m in a much better place I got the help I needed and I’m here today. But, I fear I may be going through the same thing again and I do not want that to happen again. I currently have a friend (known them for about 2 years) that I met online through a video game. We became really good friends and everything has been great up until now. Now I feel like I’m stuck because I feel as if I can’t enjoy playing this video game without my friend grouped up with me. It’s almost like I can play but it burns me out after a hour or two. So I feel like most of the day I sit around waiting and that’s obviously not healthy. It’s just so weird because I have no idea why I feel like I “need” my friend. Basically, I need advice as how to avoid recreating my previous friendship and keep this one healthy.

In the dream, a guy in a hoodie was over my bed, and I asked why he was there. He said, ""To shoot you."" I woke up and realized I was fine at that point. It was scary because it was so vivid. (I do not ever experience suicidal thoughts.)

I'm struggling to see the positives in my life. I have rapidly improved a high schooler's academics because I started tutoring her, which gives me some sense of accomplishment. I almost had a panic attack at our session today, though, which hurt my confidence in my own abilities. I have been seeking treatment because I saw a slow spiral into negativity and self-loathing in my life. Even the possible symptoms of antidepressants cause me anxiety.

I don't know what question I'm trying to ask. My posting itself could be related to starting an SSRI because it makes me wired. I would just like to share my experience and ask for advice.",29Nov2017,1
28,"I've always had some issues with motivation. I'm in college now, and currently my roommates are very into self-thought and just, generally thinking about psychology and stuff. I've talked with them occasionally about my own general 'shittiness' when it comes to doing things, and I've been thinking a lot more about my own mental state and for this reason, I think I'm much more aware of my mental state. Unfortunately, I think this has been a bad progression so far.

I think my naivety was somewhat of a blessing before, as if I did poorly in a class I would get upset, truly believe I could've done better, or sometimes blame an outside source, and then do better in the next course or whatever. Now I think I just don't care.

I feel I've squandered any opportunity to do something great with my life, only doing enough to pass by, without taking initiative or sparking passion in an interest other than video games (and recently, not even video games). I had an amazing internship this summer with a lot of freedom and opportunities to both learn and succeed, but as I usually do, I did the bare minimum to not have any get upset with me, but no more, and wasted an amazing opportunity. 

Since the start of this school year, I've failed classes (which I usually don't do), I've gained weight, and I've felt terrible (mentally). I just don't care about my major, my future, or even my body it seems, and I'm scared. I want to care, about all of these things, but wanting to care isn't enough. I'm currently awake at 4am after not having done any preparation for 2 tests I have tomorrow, or any of my homework due as well.

30,"Hello reddit!

First of all I am 19 years old male with no history of mental illnesses, no abuse, and a normal happy life, with happy family. I don't do drugs, but I smoke and drink, or used to drink a lot of coffee, before this happened.

My Mental HELL began 2 months ago. I feel like something in my mind broke... And do you know the reason? I heard of someone who died by suicide. Since then, my life changed completely.

I don't know why.

I don't know how.

I don't know what to do next.

I suddenly asked myself: ""Why he did it, he had 6 kids, he had everything? What kind of force drive him to suicide? What stops me from doing it too?"" and then I experienced something strange, something confusing.


I have really hard time describing what is happening in my brain(nearly impossible), but i will try. Life feels meaningless without any apparent reason. I am constantly anxious, have less energy. I don't go outside as I used to. I am constantly in my home, searching google articles about mental issues and so on. I am constantly in my head.

My interest in people dissapeared. There are other weird feelings in my head:(As I said, I can't trully describe them.)

weird feeling: It feels like i imagine waking up everyday but it feels like i am waking every minute.

weird feeling: Feels like I won't be here soon.

weird feeling: When I try to do something I can't do for long time. Eventually there is a weird feeling associated with a throughts like the above that doesn't allow me to do it. It is strange, feels like anxiety a bit, but not exactly.

weird feeling: When I am relatively okay, there is a feeling like I am anxious, idk strange feeling in the stomach(not exactly anxiety.) Can't fully describe it.

weird feeling: Like i am dissociated with life(not like the derealization stuff) - again I am not sure what it is it feels strange.

weird feeling: Feeling like I don't want to get better.(This is the scariest one.)

weird feeling: Feeling like years have passed between my old life and now.

weird feeling: Feeling like there is no emotional content in my memories.

weird feeling: Confusion if I am suicidal or not.

weird feeling: Feeling like a wave between now and the future happens in my head and makes me feel tired and anxious.(This happens especially in the morning, when I stand up and stop being sleepy it dissapears.)

weird feeling: When I do something it randomly appears it is like a feeling of /suicidality/hopelessness/flying feeling/ (not sure can't describe it.) and when this happens there is a strike in my stomach.

weird feeling: There are pictures stuck in my head(2 or 3) mostly regarding to future. for example: me in the garden of my university walking - like i am looking at myself from a flying drone. they seem dark or super bright in my head.

weird feeling: Feeling that there is something wrong with my thinking pattern and my rational thinking.

weird feeling: Sudden feeling of being trapped(In life?). (It happens randomly.)

weird feeling: That I will suicide if I work, and since then I am not working.

weird feeling: Going out seems weird/scary/overwhelming/I don't know.

weird feeling: Something that happened a long time ago seems close, something that happened a short time ago feels far.

weird feeling: This is about babies. Somewhere I have read ""I don't want kids on this terrible world."" And now there is a weird feeling when I see a baby.

weird feeling: Everything seems darker.

*AND THE MOST IMPORTANT* :**WEIRD FEELING THAT IF I WORK/GO TO UNIVERSITY OR FEEL OVERWHELMED I WILL S....... FEELING THAT I AM ALREADY OVERWHELMED AND WILL S......**

Yesterday I read somewhere that you are suicidal if you have desire to die. When I read this I had Anxiety attack and the thoughts felt so real, it lasted about an hour then I felt normal, and the thoughts seemed less real.

And many intrusive suicidal thoughts about 16 to be exact, I picked a lot of them while researching and now they are stuck in my head. But I will not list them because they may trigger someone.

I visited 5 psychiatrists, yet, no clear diagnosis. One of them suggested Adjustment Disorder, but I don't think that this is the case, exept I moved to new city(1 year ago.)(because I study there.), and had a lot of stress during exams, nothing more.

Do I sound suicidal?

i was diagnosed anxiety, and i am taking atarax to control it, but i can better control it in school, as compared to at my workplace. and i am super depressed at work, more than i ever been in school. i couldn't control myself at work. and would constantly feel like trying.

i quit a couple of job, and found this one, expecting and hoping for it to be better, but it always feel the same, sad, depressed cannot wait to get home. i don't want to tell my parents, because my parents think that i am a millennial and all i know how to do is live off them, but i am trying my best to adapt to the new condition, but can't seem to do so. i want to job to stick, because it is a decent job with decent pay, but i just keep crying before coming to work and at work. i just broke down in front of my colleague just now, because i just couldn't take it anymore, and i ate a couple of atarax, more than my supposedly dosage, and still couldn't calm myself down. 

and i am just hoping for the best and for myself to adapt to the job as soon as possible. i am working retail, any suggestions or idea as to how to cope with constant want to cry?

34,"I don't know whether to choose my health or career...Either one will ruin me at the rate I'm going.

I'm a 22 year old male and just months into my new job, it's fantastic money and a great opportunity for someone of my age. The work is creative and challenging, but not overwhelming. 

However... for the last two years I've developed depression and I'm worried my thoughts will soon turn into actions. I like working but I know I need a break from everything very soon. 

For the past 6 years I've suffered from several eating disorders which come and go, obviously when I'm sad or depressed they come back with a bite. I still live at home and my parents are fully aware of my eating disorder when I was diagnosed in 2014. However after a few therapy sessions they figured I'm all fixed. Wrong. To match my depression and eating I've developed severe anxiety and OCD which makes social situations so very hard. It's also recently affecting my physical ability and I've suffered multiple fainting spells in the past month due to being so anxious.

I don't know who to talk to, I feel completely overwhelmed with life and I really don't care about anything anymore. How do I move on from here? Should I quit? But I don't want to lose my job as I've worked so hard building up to this role, however my mood affects my job and I know I'm not working at 100%.

46,"First time telling this to other people... (Sorry for the long post)

Let me tell a few things about me in general and my life before I get into this condition and its effects.

I'm a 21 year old guy in the last year of University. I'll be graduating in few months. I'm pretty smart if you ask me(lol). but, seriously, I'm always among the top performers in anything that I take part in. I'm very inclined towards studying Philosophy, Politics, Religion, History, Psychology etc.. The reason I'm mentioning all these things is that, I'm smarter than the general population and among my peers too.. 

I have no problem with cognitive memory, i.e., anything to do with Facts, Statistics, Abstract/Conceptual thinking etc.. I remember the capitals of almost 150 countries even though it's been years since I've learnt them. I could quote sentences, dialogues, passages from books, TV shows and movies. So, basically my cognitive memory is pretty intact and I've never had a problem remembering anything that I studied or saw somewhere... Ok that would establish my Sanity(lol)/

But here's the problem.. I have something called SDAM(Severely Deficient Autobiographic memory) which is a memory disorder where people with this condition don't have or rather don't remember most of their PAST... Here's an article that would give you a general understanding of this condition https://www.wired.com/2016/04/susie-mckinnon-autobiographical-memory-sdam/
A simple google search would further explain this condition..

So here's what it means, I don't have a single first person experience from my past. That is I don't remember a single day of my school as myself. That is, you can ask me what school I studied in, and I would tell you the answer. it's because that is a memory linked to fact i.e., my school name, area etc. Like this you could ask me if I ever smoked a cigarette as a teenager. I could tell you, NO i didn't because, factually I know I haven't smoked in the past.. But this is pretty much where it ends. 

I don't remember what it felt like to win a competition( I know I won a few), I don't remember what it felt like all those years I spent with my friends ( I know I spent a lot of years with my school buddies).. This is the entire disorder... I don't have any first person experience of anything from my past.. This is like basically removing the ""human"" aspect of a memory and being left with just a storage drive that tells you what happened in the past.

Ok, here's where I currently face problems with this condition. I'm 21 now. For the first time, I moved out of my city, state for my university. I thought it would be hard, but as it turns out.. Within the first two weeks, I almost forgot everything that I did in my hometown.. My friends, classmates, city everything just faded in my memory as if they never existed.. I can't recollect a single memory of my life there.. I can't relive a single moment I spent with my friends.. So naturally, I stopped chatting, talking with my old buds because it felt I didn't know them at all.. I've had this condition as far as I can remember, but only a year ago I understood what it actually is.. Another example is, I was 13 years old and my sister got married. After she moved out, it was like she never existed in my life, I couldn't recollect a memory of her in our house. Until some time ago, I thought this was how memories worked for people and it was how life is..

Now here's where the problem lies. This condition has made me feel no emotions towards people, places, events in life - whatsoever.. Since childhood my parents used to ask me to come out to movies, parties, relatives houses etc. But I was never interested.. I always thought I was an introvert and didn't like meeting people all the time.. But only recently have I discovered that I used to forget about the people I met in the past and how I acted among them. This became a big issue, because last year I broke up with my gf. She was my first gf. So naturally, within a week or two, I couldn't even remember how we used to talk to each other or how we acted just as two people in a relationship.. Even some months into my relationship, I couldn't remember how we met, or how we flirted before, or how the proposal occured.. NOTHING.... This too had an effect on my relationship and was one of the reasons for the break-up, as I started getting more detached and ""Unknown""..

And Finally one more important point.. I am also a ""Sociopath"". Which means, I would want great control in a relationship for it to even smoothly function.. Due to Sociopathy+SDAM I'm literally unable to maintain any relationships whatsoever. I constantly keep changing my friends.. i don't have a single childhood or teenage friends. I have changed my place in my classroom 5 times in the last 3 years, cuz after each vacation I would have no idea who these people are like. So I move on to other side of the class. Right now my circle is my classmates. And I know in 6 months after graduation I won't be talking to anyone of these people for the rest of my life..

Right now, I'm considering not to ever enter into any relationship, romantic or even just friendship.. because i know how these are going to end.. In a few months my inner sociopath kicks in and I don't have any memory of the past to have any control over the relationship or any true meaning either.. I also lost interest in TRAVEL completely because I never remember what it felt like visiting a historical monument or a beautiful waterfalls. While everyone else narrates their pleasant memories.. It's completely pointless acc to me.

So.. yeah.. That's my situation right now,, And I know there is no ""cure"" for this.. This is just how I'm wired.. Maybe you can share your thoughts.... Again sorry for the v.v. long post... (Writing as I'm thinking.. May have been incoherent or repetitive)",29Nov2017,3

Every few weeks, with the gap between lately growing shorter, I have a full on break down. The lead up usually includes mounting anxiety, a kind of paranoid energy overdrive, and then - a crash. During the crash I'm an overwhelmed nervous wreck; I basically curl into a ball for an hour or more, scratching my own skin off at my wrists (I have several scars from this), occasionally hitting and punching myself if it gets to bad, and absolutely sobbing.

I cut when I was younger, but it had a ritual element to it that as I got older became too exhausted to continue. I've also been on and off antidepressants for years, but I can never seem to stay on them which drives my family up the wall even though they admittedly help even if they don't ""fix"" everything.

For a time I had a therapist, and she was lovely, but a lot of her approaches were with changing my thinking or behaviours and I don't think I was at a point where I was well enough for that to work.

66,"This is just a thought I've been turning over for awhile now. I've been treated on and off for major depression for ten years now, and like many, I have ups and downs. I've been going into a ""down"" for the past couple months, and I've noticed a particular trend with my friends and loved ones.


At the beginning of this episode, a dear friend and I had a bit of a clash (via text, of course) about plans to hang out on that particular day. What it boiled down to was this: She is very high-strung with an anxiety that really manifests when it comes to making plans. I, on the total opposite hand, knew that I *needed* to stay cool and flexible, and ""go with the flow,"" for my *own* sanity. I forget now what words were actually said -- something along the lines of ""I need you to tell me what time you want to be at X place!"" ""I don't know right now, whenever!"" etc etc. What felt like a small quarrel, unfortunately, has led to this dear friend totally giving me the cold shoulder and very suddenly cutting me out of her life completely.


My mom also has a lot of anxiety, and we butted heads over Thanksgiving. She had a Game Plan for cooking and cleaning, and she needed to follow it to the T. I, on the other hand, got a slow start to the day due to depression, arrived at our house late, sat down on the couch where she was mid-cleaning-whirlwind, and she lost her mind. Of course I know the holidays can be stressful like this for EVERYONE, so I'm not too fixated on this incident.


But then just today, another friend who grapples with anxiety (and OCD, which is a new diagnosis for her, and she's still coming to terms with it) got frustrated while texting each other. The details aren't really important, but once again, I realized that it was centered around making plans, and her having a specific idea of how the day would go, and me needing to be flexible and work around my depressive bouts (e.g. literally not being able to get out of bed).


Sorry for the wall of text there. I'm just wondering if anyone has any similar anecdotes to share, or if people who have anxiety feel the same way about us depressed schmucks. More importantly, I'd love some advice... How can I be a good friend and communicator with my anxious friends, while at the same time, respecting myself and my need for gentleness and flexibility? I don't want to keep butting heads with friends over things like plans! Thanks for your time. ",29Nov2017,1

Are there any aspects and practices of mental health care that exacerbate or perpetuate mental illness from your experience? No healthcare is perfect, but in mental health a ""cure"" is often times a far-reaching, subjective goal. Has anyone here encountered a practitioner, policy, or situation in mental health care that seemed to spread harm?",29Nov2017,2
69,I’m so tired of trying and thinking that things will get better. Every time things start to look like they’re getting better it all goes to shit. And I’ve been feeling that slightly today but then something really stupid occurred and I won’t be able to get what I need until way later and knowing the person that has to bring it to me won’t even care enough to get the right supplies. It’s so stupid that I’m so upset about this but it just sent me over the edge. I am so tired of putting my faith in people only for it to be thrown back in my fucking face. I’m just so done. There’s nothing left to do but to get high and not think about this anymore. I’m just so fucking done. ,29Nov2017,1

71,"I think that I have some kind of mental disease, but I can't name it. I'll try to provide you some signs.

Okay, so the problem is, that I can't look at anything without doing something (what keeps my brain like ""active"" or so.) Example: I want to watch episode of The Simpsons. I like that show. I'll turn on the video and I'm watching for +-3 minutes and then I'm starting to be borded to death, angry, nervous.. I have to move or do something. I can't stand just ""looking at the"" screen. No matter which TV show/film/whatever, I just can't watch it. I'm starting to be very nervous with every second watching it. My nightmare is going to cinema, sit down and watch a film for an hour, no matter which film. Video games are exception, since they are completely different and I don't feel passive while playing them.

I know that it may sound ridiculous, but in fact, it complicates my life in some ways. Could you please explain whats wrong with me, if anything?

Thank you",29Nov2017,1
72,"I finally had the courage to honestly answer those questions in my latest new patient intake forms. I've always been so scared of being honest about it. I've always been afraid of people overreacting and shipping me off to a facility.

But I'm so tired and so exhausted I wasn't afraid any more. So I honestly answered yes and yes.

Nothing happened. No one even mentioned it.

I guess there was nothing to worry about.

So I'm back to being suicidal. I haven't been seriously suicidal since 2013, and had a major breakthrough in 2015 that made me really honestly appreciate life for the first time ever.

But all that progress is gone now. I made a terrible mistake of convincing my husband that we should move in with his father last July to help him grieve and transition to a life without his wife, my husband's mother. He was against it, but I couldn't see it. His father seemed so nice to me and we seemed to get along so well. 

But everything changed the moment we moved in. Suddenly his father had these expectations from me that I physically was incapable of meeting. He knows I have a debilitating chronic illness, but he seemed to think that since he was older than me that I should be able to magically put aside the illness that has destroyed my career and life and become his replacement wife. The animosity against me has continued to fester while I continue to suffer struggling to battle my own demons caused by living with someone who is always mad at me.

So I wanted to die. I'm the one who has written up anti-suicide blog posts, but the messages aren't working right now. I'm too sick. I'm in too much physical pain. It's so hard to sleep through the pain. It's so hard to think through the brain fog. It's so hard to get up and feed myself. It's so hard to shower and so hard to jump through hoops to prevent a shower from dehydrating me and making my pain worse. 

And it's so hard to get through moment to moment knowing the person outside my door hates everything about me. It's so hard to ask for help knowing the person I love the most is stressed out to the max trying to help me and live up to the black hole of expectations from his father.

So I wanted to die. Came up with a plan of how to painlessly do it, and then seriously asked myself why I shouldn't. What *is* keeping me from walking out the door and hiding in some woods to enact my suicide? The last time I was too depressed to move. I can move now, so why don't I?

The only thing is the thought that maybe I shouldn't. Maybe things will change. I should just wait and see. See how things unfold. Because what if something happens to fix things and I can get back to my peaceful life alone with my husband again.

But I know, absolutely know, I can't survive the rest of the month with the way things are. I couldn't even survive this morning without my opioids, muscle relaxers, and antianxiety medication to rescue me from the torture I was experiencing. But I can't use them everyday. Even if tolerance wasn't an issue, no doctor would prescribe it to me. They already hem and haw over the 30 pills I ask for a year.

I can't live in this house where my existence is a constant imposition. I have to sneak around to avoid making noise because my FIL wants no noise in the house. I have to stave off my bordem by locking myself in my room and watch the TV on low volume. I can't read much due to my chronic daily migraines, so I can't sit on the couch without bordem, and instead lay in bed which aggravates my pain conditions. I can't have the temperature that doesn't make me dizzy, nauseous and faint because I apparently don't produce sweat, because my FIL is bitching up a storm at how upset he is that he can't have the temperature in the house the way he wants it. Whenever I do anything that can remotely cool off my room, he complains that I'm fooling the thermostat and fucking up the temperature for the rest of the house. He wants every single room the same temperature, even mine.

So I just can't live with my FIL anymore. I have to move out. Now.

My husband is shipping me off to another state to have my cousin take care of me. Because I'm so sick I can't even take care of myself.

So why won't I just die? I don't know. I'll just wait and see. Things were so nice and happy and peaceful when I was living alone with my husband. I was doing chores, some volunteer work, and even looked into starting a business. But then we realized I was doing so well that we thought, hey! Why don't we have a baby!

And then his mother died and the shit hit the fan.

So I hold out for some hope that we can get back to that life again. We had it. We can have it again. As long as his father will let him go. I have my doubts he will let my husband go without a fight. But I do have confidence that at some point my husband will put his foot down and fight to get away and win.

I had dearly hoped my husband would move out with me, but I can understand how he thinks that spending one last Christmas with his father will be helpful. I know it won't help his father because Christmas is not his problem: not having a personal slave is his problem. But I understand my husband's need to at least try.

But hopefully I'll survive through Christmas with my cousin.

I'm so tried and in so much pain and my brain is so cramped I have no idea how I'm going to pack. He wants to put me on the plane tomorrow.

But at least it isn't suicide.",29Nov2017,1
73,"I knew this for quite some time now but the other day... I was so tired after not sleeping for 24 hours and for some reason I started staring at the floor to my carpet and seeing patterns pop out - which is very unusual for be because my head feels like it's ""locked"". I'm not deprived of rational thinking - I'm deprived of some sort of seeing things with my head and relate to them. Like in my dreams - they are so shitty and dark I can't draw anything from them - only discomfort and feeling stuck in situations ALL THE FUCKING TIME.

At this point the thought occured to me and I admitted I was ""raped"". The word hit me I guess there's no other way for that. Then I went to bed and feeling my ""frontal lobe"" (forward region of the brain) being locked driving me nuts - so I set it aside as usual. I wonder if this part of the brain is related to memories (haven't done much research on that sorry).

I'm sick of feeling stuck and tired all the time. My life sucks as far as healthy human relations are concerned - I'm not seeing anyone and sleep my ass all day and wake up feeling like a piece of shit lol. Still I'm very enthusiasting about life in general not gonna lie about that - because I know it's not ""all about me"" - I've been though my teenage and early adult life I'm 32.

Not even gonna talk about being diagnosed with schyzophrenia and finding myself at times speaking with people, assaulting me with questions like I ""work for them"". Who can believe that? Think remote viewing / mind technologies etc... I'm pretty sure it is real, I could even picture the guy talking to me and his ""office"" etc... They squirted information and work out of us and we didn't get a fucking penny for that yet they left us with nothing and let us handle it on ourselves. If you live in the US you should know at this point the CIA has been using remote viewing consistently - not saying these guys were CIA but definitely saying it happened in the US.

Hang tight to your bitcoin - it was a covert ops by the ""Alliance"" to destroy the Rothschild/Soros/etc... wealth back to the hands of the PEOPLE - using mind technologies to gather intel right and left. How do they ""pick"" people? As soon as a mind rises they'll harass the fuck out of them and figure out what they ""know"". Then piece the pieces of the puzzle together and create disruptive shit. GG on bitcoin. Satoshi doesn't exist. They exploited all of us - not saying it's not going to do what it's supposed to, it's already doing it and I guess it's a good thing. Fuck the Rothshild, fuck the pedos - thank god for Trump for destroying these pieces of shit. Maybe I'll get paid 5 bucks for having had my heart and mind drained... great.

Praise God it's the only thing that really matters. -J",29Nov2017,1
74,"I'm male, 23, from the UK, and I can't believe what I'm writing. I've always had spouts of depression, but this last month has resurged it all stronger, more intense, with suicidal thoughts, and little to no way out. I completed my degree last year, had dreams of being a lawyer. Was excited to start my life and impress my family, friends, girlfriend etc. 

Since I left, I've been in a job I hate. It's not related to my degree or future aspirations, but it pays. However, recently, I've been told they are making cutbacks and to prepare for the worst (along with a few others) and it seems fairly certain at this point. Since I found this out (last Friday) I have spiralled into a mental state I never wanted to go. I'm fairly confident I wont have this job for much longer. I've been applying to my dream jobs for around a year now, graduate jobs are hard to get shortlisted in. But while I was getting paid, I could deal with it and be persistent. But now, what the fuck am I going to do? I can't even begin to imagine what job I would do if I lose it and still manage to pay my way. What am I going to do about next month's rent and bills? What am I going to do about Christmas? My girlfriend's birthday? Sure, I could just explain to them I can't afford it. But that makes me a failure. 

Utter failure of a man. I wanted to be the guy who was happy, outgoing, could impress his girlfriend's family. I wanted to be on track with my life and be excited for the future. Here I am at 23, little to no money, about to lose his job, living in a city where I know nobody, I have absolutely no way out. I have nothing to show for my life. I lived with my mother as an only child (dad died) all my life, she is poor, and I wanted to get to a point where I can treat her and make her proud. I have nothing to fall back on, I feel like the walls are closing in. 

Three of my friends have taken their own lives in the last two years, which also hasn't helped my mental state. But now I just can't stop thinking about how much of a relief death could actually be. No more burdens, no more worries, nothing. I have no idea if I would ever actually do it, but the thoughts are becoming more intense to the point where I wonder how I could do it. 

And yeah, I probably sound like a whiny first-world spoilt child. But regardless, it's how I feel. I've lost my way, I felt bad enough with the job let alone without it. I've spent the last week crying randomly, having panic attacks, thinking about what my family and girlfriend will think of me deep down (although I know they would tell me they love me anyway). But that's not the point. I don't think the reason for me being like this is the job situation, I think this has just been the trigger for something deep down. It's scary. Please someone give me some inspiration, my patience is running thin :(

EDIT: Just recieved another job application rejection. Great timing, huh. ",29Nov2017,2

76,"Because a higher power has deemed bursts of creative energy wrong.  I should've studied philosophy, then I'd at least have an excuse for sounding crazy to some people.  When I think back to about a month ago, I was momentarily very happy. I just needed someone to help me work out my thoughts. Instead I was lobotomized (not literally, but in terms of my psyche..yes).  Maybe I didn't fit the archetype of the ideal man: stoic, rational, tempered, masculine, directive...heaven forbid I dance around writing about the earth, and the trees, and the wonderful breeze... yeah, you know what I mean... Yeah, men don't do that. Men have a stiff upper lip, and wear shades. lol.. this is actually therapeutic for me. I feel better already.  *sigh*.. those might just be the result of rote memory though rather than genuine creativity coming from where it is my soul is.  Okay, maybe I'm still good in terms of creativity. It's immature and naive though isn't it? Edit: I know what happened here (and my previous comment)..after being triggered. I know.",29Nov2017,1
77,"I didn’t want to be in love, in fact I didn’t even want to date. Having recently come out of a relationship that ended in the total blindsided abandonment that has been cutely deemed “ghosting” by my generation, the last thing I wanted to do was feel vulnerable in front of another man ever again. But then my friends forced me to get Bumble, get tipsy enough to swipe though roughly fifteen guys our beer goggles deemed hot enough, and I reluctantly set up one date I had every intention of cancelling. 

Except I forgot, until two hours beforehand. And while I do have a somewhat notorious reputation in my friend group for being a bit of a heartless bitch (it comes with the territory when you’re a cute 26 year-old female lawyer in the old boys club, who was largely raised by a progressive and brilliant single dad), I knew cancelling THAT late was rude as hell. So I made the most minimal effort possible, and walked into a date I mentally deemed a failure even before I got out of my car. 

The guy was fine, and for purposes of this post we can call him Jared. He was sweet, and cute, and talked about his career and hobbies in a way that made me want to find anything in life I loved that much.  However, coming out of a relationship of intense passion and constant drunken escapades of a grand scale, everything felt a little flat and I left feeling fairly indifferent about a possible date number two. 

What I did feel was a new confidence to date all of Los Angeles. Over the next few months I continued to go on a stream of first dates with every form of bad boy in the metro area, all of which resulted in vague promises to see each other again that never amounted to anything. The one thing that remained was Jared. He was never there an obtrusive amount, but he also failed to ever let more than a few days pass without interjecting himself into my life in some little way. He remembered everything I told him about myself, and he always had a way of making me feel like the most important person in the room every time he looked at me. But I dismissed his intentions to a degree. At the time I justified my reluctance to open up to Jared as a knee-jerk reaction to his constant eagerness to understand me, but in retrospective I was probably just terrified. I guess I don’t believe in the notion of falling in love, I see it as a constant choice to accept my partner for everything he is. But where Jared was so steadfast in knowing he wanted me and only me, I felt a distinct fear in the same knowledge; and for as much as he should have many times over, Jared never gave up on me. 

Then everything changed. I can’t put into words how and why, because honestly the thought of typing out our story is still too much for me to even consider. I can say that I remember the exact minute I knew I loved him, and that I know with absolute certainty I will never forget that moment. Our relationship wasn’t perfect, but it was built on selflessness and a kind of careful understanding that I’ve never experienced in my entire life. It was painfully real, in a way that still causes me an immense amount of fear knowing I might never see that kind of love again. I allowed Jared to see vulnerabilities I didn’t even know existed, and I never felt more secure in anything than knowing that he would be a constant fixture in my future. I believed him every time he wrapped his arms around me and told me he’d never leave, and I felt so much security in knowing someone appreciated the full value of my flaws and still wasn’t scared.

Then everything changed again, far sooner than was fair to either of us. I can still mentally replay everything about the day Jared left me. A week earlier he cried to me over the phone, explaining that he had a chronic anxiety disorder that cohabited with depressive episodes- one of which had just presented itself in full-force. He pleaded with me to forgive him for not telling me sooner, which just seemed to me to be misplaced concern when all I could spend my energy on was helping provide him the support I knew he would have shown me had the roles been reversed. But despite my best efforts to reassure him that my feelings were unconditional and my fear about our future together non-existent, I wasn’t enough. The man who worshiped me from the day we met ended the relationship we had built on mutual respect over a text message. A text message sent a mere six hours after I went alone to a medical procedure where he had promised to come to provide emotional and physical support. A text message sent three days before we were scheduled to go on our first vacation together. A text message sent nine days before I turned 27. 

Jared explained that he and his therapist agreed that time alone to sort through his own emotional blocks, ones I didn’t even know existed, was necessary. But the last time I checked, he was in a relationship with me- not a doctor who had entered his life a week prior. When I tried to talk to him about the break, all he could tell me was he didn’t know what he wanted. Nothing about our conversation made sense, he went back and forth between telling me he had been considering leaving me for some time and also saying the decision came about so abruptly that he didn’t have time to warn me. I used every tactic I could think of to convince him that his constrain suggestions that I deserved better than him were wrong, and that no decision of this magnitude should be made during a time of such great pain. But most of what I said went ignored, and the rest was met with little acknowledgement and no detectable traces of empathy. He completely denied me any opportunity to have a meaningful dialogue about our relationship, and left me feeling a form of abandonment I didn’t even know existed- one that demonstrated to me that from his current perspective no aspect of our relationship was even worth trying to save. But the worst part was, I didn’t even have a target to direct all my feelings of abandonment, resentment, and anger towards. Because this isn’t him. I’m not dealing with my equal partner, but I’m still dealing with very real and painful consequences of the actions his brain has convinced him are logical and protective. What scares me even more is knowing that I will always, on some level, hope the man I loved comes back to himself and eventually back to me.

I’m an exceedingly bright person and I fully acknowledge so many standby responses to this situation. I understand that he doesn’t want to be so desperate and confused about his mindset. I get that I should consider myself lucky that a shared house, marriage, or family wasn’t impacted. I know that even if he survives this tragic episode of his life, revisiting a relationship might be too much for him or that even despite hard work by both of us it just won’t look the same moving forward. I acknowledge that this will be a part of his person forever, but also wholly discern that dealing with this reality is much less fearful than a life without him. 

I’ve reached out to him a couple times over the course of the past few months that we’ve been apart, always clearly stating that a response isn’t necessary unless he ever decides it to be in his best emotional and mental interest. In doing so I know I’m somewhat robbing myself of the opportunity to fully move on, but the thought of him working through this completely alone is far too much for me to live with. We have varying levels of darkness in our lives, but being strong for him is easy because he has already been the epitome of comfort for me in some of my hardest days.

I am not completely certain why I’m throwing this narrative into the vast void of the Internet, seeing as I’ve yet to find comfort in thousands of other words from every source imaginable. Maybe I just need to know that I’m not alone, or hear that someone else can hear the hurt in my words and understand it would take an especially different kind of person to create those kinds of emotional wounds. But what I think more than anything is that I need reassurance that having hope in love and the strength of our bond is not foolish, no matter how much it can feel that way sometimes.
