2,"Greetings. Within the past 3 days I have had 10 panic attacks. I have never had them before. I went to the ER and they said I had low magnesium and potassium. They put me on an iv of magnesium and for about 3 hours I felt perfectly fine. They gave me enough Xanax to last a few days. After that wears off I am back to square one. Sense of doom/dread creeps up, I tell myself everything is ok, then I start crying uncontrollably, shaking, sweating and hyperventilating. Once I ride it out that feeling of doom is still there. I want to think its just medical and not mental. But I have been under a great deal of stress lately and work in the mental health field which could contribute to this. Please help. I feel so uncomfortable and sick its almost unbearable. I am going to sit in the clinic tomorrow until someone sees me. Not one clinic had appointments available but I feel like this is an emergency. Any advice or suggestions are welcome. I just cant feel like this anymore.",07Apr2017,1

4,"My husband and I think that I would benefit from either an inpatient or partial hospitalization program to stabilize myself. I'm not exactly a danger to myself right this moment, but if something bad were to happen and upset me, I probably would be.

There's a freestanding psychiatric hospital nearby that I plan on calling. From what I've read on their website, you call in and they schedule you for an assessment.

What questions should I expect them to ask when I first call, and during the assessment? This whole thing is causing me immense anxiety, and I think it would help to not go into this completely blind.

Edit: Another option I'd have is to go to the ER. But I feel like if I'm stable enough to get through tonight, then it's probably not necessary to go there. I'm assuming though, that the questions they'd ask would be similar?",07Apr2017,1
7,"I know what it is, but what is it from someone whose had them?

Last night I got maybe two hours of sleep. It was an incredible night with a few friends, but then I got to the house I'm at. Around 1 am I went to bed. 

Lately I've been very depressed from numerous things going on. 

Anyway, after I went to bed, I put on my music playlist, as I do every night. After a short while, I started to freak out. 
A crushing sort of film showed up and I couldn't calm down. There was one point where I was saying ""no one cares"" for what felt like half an hour. I couldn't calm down no matter what I tried. 

Is that a panic attack or just bad night?

10,"I don't have access or money for a psychiatric help so I'm fucked. I'll probably end up in the worst possible way but until then I'm trying to become self aware of my diagnosed problems in hope I can learn some coping skills to deal. 

I've been diagnosed numerous times from 5 to 24 with 

Depression
Bipolar disorder with manic episodes 
Anxiety 
ADHD 

I'm sure some other things. I haven't been meds in 4 years and I haven't gotten help for it. So now here I am probably in the worst place I could be mentally trying desperately not to succumb to my deep desires to end it. 

So help me with this to see if I have a way to deal with it next time. 

My husband has a conference here in town that he is heavily involved in. In fact he's in charge of it. He invited me to a pre party and I went and said hi and went home. I knew the event was going to be late. I'm not jealous or worried he's cheating. He loves me so much and is fiercely loyal and so patient with all of my issues. 

Yet even tho I knew the event was late I felt my blood boiling he wasn't home. This pettiness grows inside me. I don't even care! That's what's killing me. I go hours and I'm fine then all of a sudden I know he will be home soon and I just get so blindly upset. 

I'm not an arguer, so instead of starting a fight I just ignore him for no freaking reason. I mainly do it not to upset him but if I don't then the moment I speak I will go off. So I have to swallow my anger so he won't go to bed upset because I have no reason to be upset with him. 

This man is a saint. There are days when I can't even get out of bed. I'm failing classes, I barely want to shave my legs or do anything. I hate my life and he knows how I suffer but I don't share too much, I don't want to scare him and have him worry too much. These are my own demons. I've depended on people too much in the past and I really need to learn how to deal on my own until I can afford proper therapy and medication.

12,"Hello!  I actually posted part of this ""story"" on an AskReddit thread earlier, but was wondering if there's anything I could do (from both a legal standpoint and just general advice).  I don't post often on Reddit so any comments will be appreciated, thanks!

____

Last year I was hospitalized for anxiety, and while I was there they took away my phone when I was first admitted. Long story short, I only had my phone for a few hours before they took it away again, and during that time someone hacked into it. I'm not 100% sure what they did exactly, but it wasn't password protected since I was borrowing a friend's device and forgot to set one when I installed my SIM card (I lost my original phone at a concert a few days prior).

I realized something was fishy because my phone wasn't charging properly and it looked like people weren't receiving my calls/texts. From what I pieced together, it also looked like my friends were receiving strange calls/voicemails which consisted of voice clips of the phone calls I made to others while I was in the hospital. Weird stuff started happening too, like my clothes/shoes would disappear out of my car/apartment/etc, my keys would go missing then reappear somewhere remote, random food that neither my roommate or I bought would I appear in the fridge, etc. I think at one point there was a discrepancy regarding how much money I had in my bank account when I am 99% sure I overdrafted but the payment disappeared.

My anxiety worsened and a lot of people/friends thought I was crazy. I actually lost many friends over this :(

I reached out to my old counseling center from college and they suggested I file a report and get my electronics forensically examined. When I tried to file a report at the local police office, the officer told me to go to my psychiatrist and shooed me away. I sent in my laptop and phone to a local investigator, who found little to no suspicious malware (but did think something was up since I got really weird screens). In the end, I never found out who was going into my stuff or how they got into it, and it gradually kinda stopped so I gave up on trying to figure out what was going on. I occasionally still get glitches though.

___

Is there a way I can report what happened to some kind of legal entity?  I tried submitting claims where I could but didn't have any luck.  My hospitalization occurred in Philly, and when I tried to make a report there, they said they couldn't help me since most of the suspicious things were going on where I was living at the time (DC).  The officer in at the police station I went to in DC didn't take me seriously (it was there where I was told to go see my psychiatrist and get my meds changed).  I submitted some kind of online form but no one got back to me on that either.  I don't necessarily want to get anyone in trouble, but I am curious to see what information they were able to get into because, well, security reasons.

I currently see a therapist now and he says I exhibit some PTSD-esque symptoms (especially regarding sleep disturbances), any advice on how to deal with that?

14,"I'm schizophrenic, but most people can't see that I have a problem.

When people find out I'm disabled, I often get shit from them about how I should be working because I'm in good physical condition.

It's not like that happens every day, but it happens enough to where it's an actual problem.

For the past 8 years I've been believing their bullshit and trying to find work. When I do get hired somewhere, I always fail, and normally it deteriorates my mental health.

20,"Hi all, his is my first post here. This is something about me, that doesn't particularly worry me, but is a little weird nonetheless, and I can't find others who do something similar.
Now. Basically, I talk to myself, a lot. Kinda. I think I've done this as long as I can remember, but I've been doing it a lot more this last year. I attribute this to my lack of social contact outside of my family; simply put, I don't talk to people a lot. I've tried searching for people who also do this, but I can't find anything specific to the *way* I talk to myself. I don't have conversations with myself, more I pretend I'm responding, or giving a speech to others. An obvious example, that many people seem to do also, is reliving an embarrassing moment or moment you wish you could change, and thinking of what you could/should have said. When I do this, however, I basically role play the whole scenario, and change what I want to change. I also sometimes pretend to give a speech, or describe something, all in my head or under my breath. This post for example, I did the same thing. It wasn't like I was planning what I was going to say, I just was doing it for... fun? I can't think of a better word to describe it. I even said, under my breath, ""this post for example, I did the same thing"", totally meta, but it didn't feel weird. It never feels weird when I'm doing it, but then I take a step back, and go ""wtf, what I just did was a little weird"".. of course that was also under my breath. Anyway, if you've made it this far through my rambling post, I'd ask, do any of you guys and gals do this? Is there a name for this? I can't seem to find anything like this no matter what I search. I realize this is probably really common, but nonetheless, any ideas about this, or personal experience, or anything is appreciated.

23,"I'm a 19yr old freshman in college over 12hrs from home. This year has been the most stressful, chaotic year of my entire life and I'm just yearning to go home.

I party way to much to the point of near ridiculousness. Recently, it's gotten me into a lot of trouble. I get blackout drunk and start fights with my friends, nearly get in trouble with the law (my last fake was snapped last night), my grades are not good at all, and my mental health is deteriorating.

I've found myself not being able to eat (I've lost over 20lbs in college- Went from 167 to 145lbs). I had a bit of an eating disorder in high school but now it's honestly worse than ever, I find myself getting physically sick at even the thought of food. 

My friends have had multiple intervention-type things for me, saying I need to stop drinking so heavily and getting blackout drunk and hostile with them. One of my latest episodes was getting blackout at a club, flipping a table, and shoving my roommate and his boyfriend.

Speaking of living situations, my roommate and I used to be close (we unfortunately hooked up once when I was blackout drunk), but now he can barely stand me and constantly insults me and finds ways to put me down (granted i've been shitty to him so I feel like I should just suck this up and take it)- we're in the same group of friends so I see him all the time.

I find myself sad all the time, crying often, feeling extremely alone and depressed. My friends are all very supportive and I come to them occasionally I'm just sick of being a burden and the fuck up of my friend group. I've been told by some of them that i'm one of the most toxic people they've ever met. 

It's sad because everyone here thinks i'm crazy and i'm starting to not be able to tell anymore if I am or not. My roommate loves to throw in the dig that he can't wait until the whole world sees how crazy I am and people will truly see me for what I actually am.

okay this is starting to get really long but i'll end it on this last woe lmao... I'm a gay man at a very gay friendly school in a gay friendly city and I'm deemed pretty attractive- however- every gay person here cannot STAND me due to past incidences of me being blackout drunk and incredibly rude (which is literally my own doing) and therefor i've only had pointless hookups and not one date or meaningful relationship.

29,"I read the headline of an article that pretty much said, “How Can Someone Obsessed with Food Be Anorexic?”  I am now recovering from my eating disorder, and I can tell you that I was and still am OBSESSED with food.  When I got down to below 90 pounds, all I thought about was food and now that I have started recovering, all I think about is food.

Food is constantly on my mind.  The first thoughts when I wake up are:

“What I am going to eat today?”

“How much am I going to let myself eat today?”

“When am I going to eat today?”

“Am I going to feel guilty about my food choices today?”

etcetera…  

Even when I am focused on other things, I AM THINKING ABOUT FOOD.  Food is the hamster in the wheel always spinning in the back of my mind.  It is my obsession. This is very frustrating to me seeing that when I ate “normally,” I didn’t pay much attention to food (this is not to say I didn’t ever enjoy it).  I mean, I just ate whenever I felt hungry, ate what I wanted, and wasn’t consumed by the crushing weight of guilt that comes over me when I eat something “bad.”  If I’m not thinking about food, then I am most likely thinking about exercise and how I should do more than the yoga I do in the mornings, or maybe I should start running more, or should I start doing workout videos again. Maybe I should join some of my co-workers at the gym when they go, etc.  I find it so difficult to trust my decisions nowadays when it comes to my food and exercise choices. Am I making this decision because I actually want to or am I making it because I am afraid I’ll feel guilty or because I am relapsing?

I really don’t want to relapse, but sometimes it just seems like the easiest option to get me to stop feeling this anxiety. When I was restricting, I at least felt like I had some control over my emotions and what I was doing.  Now that I have started recovering, I feel like I am spiraling.  Of course, I have had times in my past when I felt nervous or anxious, but nothing like the crippling anxiety I have felt since starting recovery.  I honestly don’t remember feeling this level of anxiety when I was actually dealing with my eating disorder.

I would wake up at 5am on weekdays, would do a T-25 video, drink a glass of water, got to work and make sure to drink two cups of green tea when I got there, eat a lunch that would not exceed 250 calories at 11:45, went down to the gym at work and would walk on a treadmill for an hour, made sure I walked at least 10 flights of stairs and walk 12,500 steps before I left for the day, I would then get home, eat a dinner with a restricted number of calories and make sure to be done with eating by 8pm, get my lunch ready for the next day and start the process over again.  My routine for the weekends differed some but not much.  My therapist asked me once what happened when I didn’t follow these strict rules I placed on myself, and I didn’t have an answer.  I can be stubborn and that trait only harmed me in this case because I was fully dedicated to my ways.

I knew that I would have felt guilty if I didn’t abide by my own strict guidelines. My OCD had taken over my life completely. It’s funny that I can trick myself into thinking that the time most consumed by my eating disorder was easier.  I was so fearful without really realizing it.  I knew I had a problem for a while but I just couldn’t let myself stop and I was afraid of what would happen if I did.  During the worst part of my eating disorder, I wouldn’t go out to eat with anyone. I had to make food myself, fixated on using measuring cups and only eating what I thought was “good” food.  I was slowly disintegrating, constantly agitated, scared of how I looked, and constantly paranoid about my food and exercise decisions (thinking I always needed to be doing more).

Recovering is hard, and sometimes it’s incredibly hard.  I am now facing all my struggles head on, and I can feel the emotions weighing on me all the time.  When I began recovery, I was so unsure and extremely anxious (and pretty much still am).  It’s hard to describe how the anxiety takes over everything, how it feels like it’s eating me alive sometimes.  I can’t think about anything other than the blinding panic, and I start feeling so overwhelmed and scared.  That’s an emotion that has definitely stayed consistent. I AM SCARED.

Before, I was scared of never pushing myself enough or by the thought of failing my eating disorder-focused-mind. Now I’m scared that I can’t trust my instincts. I’m scared because I want to listen to my anorexia a lot of times. I’m scared that I will never feel normal around food again. I’m scared that I will always live with this guilt and fear. I’m scared to let my family down. I’m scared to let myself down. I’m scared that I will always be obsessed with food.

It’s so strange to deal with this.  I first dealt with depression when I was 17.  I wouldn’t usually consider myself an overly emotional person, but that’s what depression did to me.  I would just become overwhelmed with sadness.  I know a lot of people talk about how depression makes people feel numb to the world, but I had the exact opposite reaction.  I would be fine one minute and then flooded with intense sadness the next.  I remember one day I woke up on a Saturday and just laid in my bed crying for hours.  I couldn’t stop.  There were definite issues going on in my life that only encouraged my depression, but it was nothing like I had experienced before.

This time I feel different.  I don’t feel the draining grief that I felt at 17.  I now feel overwhelming anxiety and panic.  I’ve never felt this kind of pure panic before, and it’s scary.  I don’t know how to react to the things I’m feeling, and the physical changes I’m going through.  What do I do when I have a panic attack at my desk in the middle of the day?  What do I do when I don’t want to eat lunch because I’m scared that I’ll feel guilty later on because of it?  How am I supposed to react when I’m so bloated and uncomfortable?  What am I supposed to do about these body insecurities I now have?  What am I supposed to do when I don’t know what to do and feel like I can’t trust myself?

Why do I think these horrid thoughts? It is incredibly distracting when trying to pay attention to what they are saying, instead it is if my brain is trying to tempt me into what could happen if I lost control and entered the 'psycho' mood.

37,"For the past few months I was completely fine. Life was going great. Im going to add that I'm 16. Then yesterday, my best friend got depressed and started threatening suicide, and I sent this long message about how much of an amazing friend he is, and how much so care. His situation is complicated though, and he went through with it anyway. He didn't die. He's in the hospital for a week. He's tried it a number of times though. But for some reason immediately after I told him how much I cared, I felt instant regret because I suddenly felt like I was *ruining* our friendship by doing this and offering love and support. I have a huge fear of ending up alone, too, and I think this event may have triggered everything I used to feel or something, because I was so sad and felt so alone that I cried for two hours straight and just couldn't stop no matter how hard I tried.  I suffered quite a few years of loneliness in elementary and all through middle school, had no friends, and I think I'm so desperate to keep the ones I have now in highschool that disagreeing with them at all makes me anxious and feel like I've just fucked up or made some massive mistake. It's unhealthy and is interfering with my life. I do have anxiety though. I'm getting treatment, May 1 is the first appointment but I could really use some tips in the meantime. 

But since yesterday, I've had this horrible feeling in my chest like everything is going to crash and burn, and I need to do something to get rid of it. I keep getting urges to do things one might consider dangerous or reckless, like speeding, running through a street of cars, smoking marijuana(please don't lecture me on how ""safe"" it is), and an overwhelming amount of everything else.

This itself is not okay.* I refer to myself as ""we"" when I'm alone and I know I need help, but I just don't know what the fuck is going on with me or what's happening. School isn't a big stressor or anything either, I just keep reasoning with myself about one thing and then immediately convince myself not too because I think about all the logical outcomes and it's fucking torture.

42,"My ex boyfriend and I dated for four years, we broke up about a year ago. He was emotionally abusive, as well as sexually abusive. I had woken up with him inside of me, continuing after saying no. *[I was raised in a abusive household, where my mother was also abused so I didn't think I there was anything wrong with the way my ex boyfriend treated me.]* My ex boyfriend, put me down a lot and isolated me from my friends and family. I had tried to break up with him, but he manipulated me into staying on more than one occasion. He would be angry and jealous about me spending time with my friends, and would insist to go with. However, my friends would decline or cancel plans with me when they found out about his attendance. My friends expressed concern but I was deluded enough at the time to believe I loved him and he loved me. When I was finally able to break up with him, I told him we were broken up, but we could talk about things in a week-like where we stand (friends or not), he agreed. However, I became quickly attacked with endless phone calls and text messages. When I wouldn't engage his behavior at first, he showed up at my house unannounced, banging on my door. He has reason for this trip, he was dropping my personal items off on my porch, but then insisted I HAD to tell him why we broke up, and that he DESERVED an explanation. I told him he needed to leave my property. He did but only to return five minutes later. He was banging on the door again, telling me I OWED it to him. I told him he needed to leave, I was home alone and half asleep-as he had woken me from a dead sleep. I was scared and sent him away, hoping he wouldn't return. He returned once more, conveniently to drop off more of my personal belongings. Still angry and insisting I have to speak with him. *I never let him in the house- we have a locked screen door and a wooden door, I cracked open the wooden door to speak to him only*. I told him this time if he returned to my property the police would be called. I was petrified to leave my house anywhere alone. But the threat of the police kept him away for the moment. He still continued to harass me through electronic communication, going between ""I love you come back"" to ""I am the only one that cares about you, no one else loves you"". He asked my mom, and more than one of my friends to speak to me on his behalf for forgiveness. I told him if he didn't leave me and my family alone I would get a restraining order, and things seemed quiet for a little bit. It wasn't until he HAPPENED to show up at the same place I did, that I realized it wasn't that simple. He claimed it was coincidence. Later, his best friend confronted me, providing me text messages between him and my ex. He told me flat out ""He is stalking you"". When I blocked my ex off of facebook, his used his best friends account to find me and my location via ""find friends"". With this he managed to follow me places, and this included sitting around the corner in his truck while I was at my friends house, waiting for me to come out. It got to the point, where legal action had to be taken, after finding out about what his best friend eluded to. I already struggle with Mental Illness-so all of my pre-existing anxiety was through the roof. Panic attacks were close together and intense. I passed out because I saw a truck I thought looked like his (not even close-different model and color). This was all during the restraining order process and after. Once he was served, I didn't hear anything from him [I was protected under a temporary order]. However, when we went to court-he showed up and served me that day so the trial had to be pushed. What he served me included letters from his family, his mom and two of his sisters and his own letter. These letters trying to make me seem as though I am the abuser, that I always made him unhappy and they expressed concern, that it was my mental illness that made him unhappy and that he did not do anything wrong and I was making some sort of sick joke. Once the three hearings were done(it took three to finish it), I went up there alone, I did not have any letters from anyone, I had my own deposition and all the text messages for proof and I came in with one person sitting in the audience for me. He came in with a witness (one of the sisters that wrote a letter against) and four family members-along with his letters. So after these three hearings, I got a restraining order- it was evident he lied in court documents because I had evidence to prove otherwise and when asked about the stalking, he admitted guilt-which he denied in the letter. After all of this, I got a restraining order-while it makes/made me feel better-it doesn't return my piece of mine. It's been almost a year since the breakup and the stalking started and I am over the relationship but my peace of mine was taken and I can't seem to get it back. I see a therapist and a psychiatrist, as much as I can fiscally afford. But I still can see and feel and hear these things happening in my head, and I can't not be afraid when I see a truck that looks close to his.
I am wondering if anyone has experienced similar?
Or has suggestions on how I could find my way back to having some peace of mind?

**tdlr;** My abusive ex-boyfriend of four years stalked me and I got a restraining order, but I still can't find any peace of mind[I do receive professional treatment]. Do you have similar experiences? Do you have anything that could help? ",07Apr2017,3
