1,"My sister was admitted to a mental health facility two days ago for a sudden onset of psychosis. Nobody knows the true cause yet, but she was extremely stressed with university work and insomnia. All evidence points toward Schizoaffective Disorder, but I’m no expert. I have been up with her all night for a week, taking it in turns with my parents to stay up and watch her because she was just trying to kill herself/run away all the time. On Tuesday (I think??) I caught her with a noose around her neck and that was the last straw. We just can’t look after her on our own. I’ve been hugging her, reassuring her, and telling her that we love her but she doesn’t believe it. She thinks police are monitoring the house and she’s going to be arrested for child grooming. This was only because she’d watched To Catch A Predator the night before. That’s how it started. 12 hours later in A&amp;E and they just sent her home with Ambien, despite me saying she will kill herself. Luckily, the next day we managed to get her sectioned so she’s safe.

 This is her second time being sectioned, and this time I feel as though she will never get better. I have lost any optimism and haven’t been able to get out of bed since it’s all happened. I’m frightened to death. I know it’s not all about me, but I feel like I’m grieving. We’ve been advised by the hospital to not visit her because she’s too far gone. All she does is pace up and down and not sleep. I feel like it’s all my fault for not taking her to hospital sooner. Have I done irreversible damage by allowing her psychosis to fester? I am trying so hard to stay strong and not break, but all I want to do is curl up and die. I wish it was me who was ill, I deserve it instead. Help",11May2019,10
2,"So this is going to be a long post but please bear with me as I’m in dire need of some advice. So I’ve been smoking weed for about a year straight all day and I also was a caffeine head pretty much the whole time as well.. until one day at work I had a panic attack from an energy drink that freaked me out really bad but I went home and worked out thinking I would just burn off the caffeine, well the next day after that I still would wake up and not feel right, I continued to have anxiety and everytime I smoked weed I would panic which never happens for me so I went to the ER just to make sure everything was fine and my EKG and blood work all came back normal. Well the next week after that I had this strange worry in my stomach everyday all day long and stupidly one day before going to the zoo with my girlfriend and daughter I took one hit of weed and everything felt so wrong, I had weird up and down moods all day long and would have what I assume to be panic attacks the whole time, that night after the zoo before going to sleep I got what I assume is an intrusive thought about harming my daughter which freaked me out to no end and kept me up all night..eventually one day I woke up with paralyzing anxiety and suicidal thoughts which is totally opposite from my personality..my girlfriend chalked it up to caffeine and “weed withdrawal” but my mom insisted we go to the ER where they assessed me and said the thoughts were due to the anxiety and gave me Ativan which didn’t seem to help and  made me feel like I was living in a dream nearly everyday so I stopped the Ativan. The intrusive thoughts about hurting myself and my daughter only got worse and so did my ability to remember things and I lost all interest in my workout and diet routine and eventually I lost all emotion besides the occasional guilt and sadness.. stupidly I googled my ass off and convinced myself I was having either prodromal schizophrenia or psychosis so I decided to see two different psychologist/ psychiatrist who insists that I have a form of OCD and anxiety but I don’t have sweaty palms or racing heart etc. only racing thoughts.. both of my psych’s don’t believe I have any signs of schizophrenia but that didn’t bring me much reassurance. My psychiatrist started me on gabapentin which only made me feel drunk and gave me a headache.. I’m even having a hard time remembering all the info to form this post which scares me because I normally have a very good memory even when I was smoking. My girlfriend thinks I just googled too much stuff and convinced myself I have every mental illness known to man.. whatever this is is even affecting the way I feel with my daughter, family and friends.. I literally have been googling symptoms everyday all day long for the past month and a half so I can see how my girlfriend thinks that but it still doesn’t explain the lack of emotion, the inability to focus for very long and at times I still feel very detached from myself and my daughter which hurts the most as she totally gave my whole life purpose and I love her more than words can explain..I’m so sorry this is the longest post I’ve ever seen on reddit but I’m literally going to lose my girlfriend and I’m in DIRE need of help.. thank you to those who took the time to read this. Again my symptoms are intrusive thoughts, memory issues, limited emotions, lack of interest in just about everything, over eating, mental fog, and at times my thoughts seem a bit disorganized. Hope someone can help thank you again.",11May2019,1
3,"this life of me being anxious all the time and being attention seeking honestly is annoying. all i really am is isolated, that’s all it is. i am delusional and i fear that i am going insane. i believe that this is one big simulation meant for me as a trial of some sorts.

4,"Hi all, this is going to be relatively long I think. 
So, I have diagnosed ADD, depression, and anxiety (generalized, situational, social, and traumatic). 
I had to leave school because of these issues affecting my ability to attend class. 
This isn’t what I’m here about though. 
So I’ve been working at a restaurant for just over two years. Started as a hostess, got promoted to server last August.
Recently one of my coworkers got fired three days ago (dealing with lots of guilt about that even though I was only one of like ten people who witnessed one really bad thing), another one just put in her two weeks, another is out of the country, and another is performing all week so she can’t work at all. Every server is working Mother’s Day and now we are down two, which has gotten me super stressed. Also worked six days (7 shifts, one of the days I had to work a double) in a row, finally ending after Tuesday night. This is really atypical for me and stressed me out so much; though, while working them I handled them decently. 
Once my coworker got fired, I started having much more frequent work-related stress dreams. It used to be once a week, and last night I had two out of my four dreams be horrifically stressful. 
Yesterday at work, my vision started getting fuzzy (couldn’t focus on things, getting poor balance, feeling really off). I just thought it was me getting vertigo or starting to get sick. 
However today at work, I came in to host (I do it on Fridays). Gets super stressful and busy the moment I get in. I start to feel really off, my blood pressure is through the roof, my blood is pounding in my ears, my vision gets all weird again, and I just can’t relax and get a grip on things. Mention it to the head chef, he just goes on and on about how I should try meditation (it’s never worked for me because of my ADD and the stimulants I’m on for the ADD). I figure maybe it’s time for me to take my second Ritalin, maybe it’s just my ADD acting up or something. 
Time for this insert:
 take Concerta normally for my ADD. It lasts about 7 hours. Ritalin supplementary as it only lasts about 4 hours. My work shifts last 5-6 hours so I usually take Concerta but my dad’s company just changed their insurance which now requires my psychiatrist to submit forms to them saying I need Ritalin and Concerta for my ADD and they need to cover it (Concerta is $495 for 30 pills before insurance). I am one of the people who requires name brand Concerta, because generic doesn’t work as well and yada yada. Turns out the insurance refuses to cover name brand Concerta for everyone because it’s a “plan exclusion”. I’m ready to fight Optum RX on this bullshit but whatever. So, I’ve been taking two Ritalin for work this past week (one at 2 to last me until 6 and another to last me from 6 to 10). 
Okay, continuation:
I try to push through whatever weird stuff my body is doing and I manage for a little bit but it suddenly gets worse. I start to tear up and immediately lock myself in the bathroom to try to stop whatever is happening. I am pacing the small room, rapidly texting my parents and psychiatrist, trying to figure out what is happening and how to stop it. My breathing is getting more ragged and my vision is super off. I keep crying. After squatting on the bathroom floor for a couple minutes, I will myself to go out and try working again (since it’s busy and I feel really bad about leaving people without my help). Can’t do it, blood starts pounding more. Decide to go into the fridge, because it said online that the cold can help. I’m in there for a little bit and then am asked by my friend, the other hostess (who completely understood and was sensitive to what I was going through as she has similar issues) to make some desserts. Easy peasy, I’m in the basement away from customers any way. So I do, bring them to the table, try to act normal, while this thing is still running rampant inside of me. Frantically text my parents to try and get help or some response. My boss sees (he can be a real dick sometimes so thank god reddit is decently anonymous) and comes over and makes a rude remark about me being on my phone and accuses me of not doing my job. He leaves and I immediately start crying again. I felt so bad about having people wait while I freaked out in the bathroom and him being mean just sent me over the edge. I had to leave. Figure out I’m definitely having a panic attack. I go to the back and my friend, the other hostess, brings me my things and I leave, apologizing and feeling horrible about having to leave after only working two hours. I walk the block home, crying and shaking, and immediately start hyperventilating and freaking out the minute I get home. 

I’ve never felt this bad before in my life. I can’t figure out why this has suddenly happened. 

Have I developed a panic disorder? Am I overworked and the stress is causing this? Is it from withdrawing from Concerta?
Please, anyone, help me figure this out. 

Still currently in the panic attack, definitely better from before but still shaky with blood pounding and breathing and vision weird.",11May2019,1

6,"So Im hospitalized after confessing a plan to my dad to shoot myself after giving up on trying to end my self hatred and depression, but I dont want to destroy my family, so im here and need to put my life in order. I need to find a way to be happy so I dont kill myself so I dont hurt my family. 

Ive been depressed since 15, im 22. Ive tried going to college, joining clubs, some therapy  self help bppks, exercise, diet, etc. I even tried zoloft (4 days of torture, most awful side effects) and wellbutrin (2 weeks of anxiety and too much energy). I hate meds but im out of alternatives. So my doctor gave me wellbutrin but after two days i was filled with too much energy and hard to breathe and he switched me to Effexor (He didnt want to give me an SSRI since it messed me up before, but he also considered lithium). 

Anyways, day 1 was yesterday, i had 37.5mg. My muscles felt weak, i was shaky and unstable when walking, mild nausea when yawning. Then at night, all of the lights, shadows and objects in the room were moving and shifting and stretching and i could see the air and there were geometric patterns, it was so fucked up, even my thoughts kept getting lost and i had hypnagogia, hearing sounds in my head, my mind showing me random visuals in my head. Because of this, i was terrified and thought i am schizophrenic, but something like this has never happened before. The nurse said the drugs dont do this, its just anxiety but i dont know if i believe her, she gave me another lorazepam. The next day, the doctor told me hes unsure why it happened, maybe drugs, maybe anxiety but its normal and he highly doubts i have psychosis or schizophrenia. He is tired of switching meds and this time hes tell me to just stick with it. Im tired of trying so many meds as well.

Anyways, day 2 75mg and im not much better. Ringing in ears, i feel sick, very weak muscles, and the worst thing is i am constantly yawning and when i do my throat feels so tense and so nauseous that it feels like my whole face is drooping. I am scared the borderline hallucinating will happen again.

So, has anyone here experienced any of the same symptoms? How long till they went away? If you had these bad symptoms, did the drug end up working for you still? How long till it began to help you? Do the good effects last a year or more? Or do they wind down? Does it damage your brain? Is it impossible to quit?

Im depressed and scared and need to feel good so i dont die, do i have a chance with this drug? 
Thanks!",11May2019,5
7,"I have severe depression and anxiety. Most of my anxiety is social anxiety. I've always been someone who worked a lot, just in retail management and busy, stressful coffee shops, but I've always worked. Over the past 2 years I've had a LOT of big events in my life, some being relatively traumatic to me emotionally. Others needing my full attention and demanding me to be seemingly ""normal"" mentally in order to take care of those close to me. Now that all of this has calmed down, I moved into a healthy living situation in a great apartment with my boyfriend and sister who love and support me, I am no longer being fully depended on by anyone, I have a safe and stable home life for the first time in a long time. 

BUT, I still have my mental illnesses. And I'm working with a doctor to help me learn to cope with these, but I am still at the very beginning of that journey. I had to quit my job some months ago in order to deal with the demands at home, and went through a period when starting a new job whilst moving was just too much for me to handle. I started transcribing online, but the pay is very, very low. I am an artist and try to sell my work on Etsy, but don't have enough of a following to make money doing that and am not sure how to get that following. 

What I REALLY want is to use this time to really dive into selling my art, establishing an online store presence, connecting it with a podcast/youtube channel discussing mental health, philosophy, and all things creepy. 
But I am dirt poor. My boyfriend is a tattoo artist apprentice and makes little money for now. I make a few bucks transcribing, but it doesn't even cover food some weeks. I guess my question to the Reddit universe is this-- 

Is there really money to be made from online platforms and art? Has someone found a way to make money from this without already being super well known? Should I keep trying to put my energy into art and make a podcast/youtube channel, or is this unrealistic and I need to find any job I can get ASAP? 

My mental health state makes finding and working a job really difficult for me. I CAN do it, as I have in the past, but if there's anyone out there who has dealt with something similar and found a way to make money from their creative outlets, please help?",11May2019,1

10,"Hi, my name is Dalton and I was diagnosed with chronic anxiety and severe depression. I was prescribed 50mg sertraline and I never went back cause...well anxiety. I continued to take my pills and internally try my best to acknowledge negative emotions or thoughts and proceed to question why these situations make me feel like said way. 

That was two years ago. Now, I've been off my pills for three months. The doctors stopped writing a script cause it's been so long and I owe them money for not canceling my appointments. I'd like to think I've made tremendous strides in my mental health. I'm in a 4 year relationship that feels like it's crumbling away. My fiance recently cheated on me by sending nudes to someone and instead of giving in to anxiety and such, I sat down and talked to her about why and who and all that stuff. It's been over a week now. 

Although I'm doing my best to keep us going, she's saying we should take time apart and that means I have to move back home to Florida (I'm in NY) and restart life. She also wants to stay and work on us together. The advice I'm honestly asking about is; 

Is it possible for two people to focus on their mental health at the same time in a relationship? I don't want to wear either of us down and if being apart for some time will help her better than me being with her, I want to do that. I want to make sure she succeeds and betters herself. And by no way am I saying she's bad or evil or anything like that. I know she's just sad and scared of the world we live in.",11May2019,2

12,I have been angry on many occasions where my body has felt different like lighter stronger just everything. Verbal abuse can activate it when attacked a similar affect happens . Iv flown down 40 steps my vision was sharp black and white i said one word and punched someone who i thought betrayed me at the time i was far from fit and could of done that 100 times over. I can activate it if i concentrate and it will last forever until i stop noticing it i have tested it and have been able to throw things at a distance i would usually find challenging easy.this sounds cool but when a person activates it its as if i feel truly threatened i have always said before getting angry “ who am i!!?”  Like this verbal treatment can not be said to me. Now how do i control that as im not hot headed but these words are threats people have threatened me and doubted me and this caused alot of trouble. In the recent years i have slowed down on socialising therefor less arguments therefor lack of communication what will i say??? If i do get mad because “ whatt” tricks me and makes my head lose focus so i only have emotion if im threatened its always anger and fear but my fear makes me want to end the person quickly what can i do more than cutting down communicating to make sure i injure nobody,11May2019,1
13,"  Hello guys, this story I have is kinda long because we were friends for almost three years and things were kinda crazy between me and him. So back story, I met him in 2016 at the gym and we became friends. He looked a lot like Gerard Way haha and I was 16 and obsessed with my chemical romance (still am tbh). We started talking at the gym and when we were first going to hang out, his dad died. Obviously we didn't hang out that day, but I told him I would be there for him till the end and I made a playlist for him too. He didn't really talk to me for a good year but we had each other on Facebook and I would message him when I needed some mj cause he knew where to get some. He would always be so nice and ask at the end of the day if I got it.
  So, at the beginning he was super nice to me and we were very good to each other. We started hanging in the summer of 2017 then he went to Idaho to work in the fields and came back in like 4 months and started hanging out again. So things started getting weird at around the summer of 2018. One time, I was at work and he had messaged me earlier like right before work. Then he started spamming me asking me if I was ignoring him and stuff. One time I asked if I could grind my MJ at his house and that I'll smoke him out another time (I thought he was going to be cool with it since I would always buy is flower to smoke) and he got suppppper pissed. He started insulting me and told me that people have tried to use him for his house (since he can smoke anytime). And I kept telling him that that wasn't my intention. I was just asking for a small favor. He called me and I answered and he was cussing me out and I got anxiety from it, I kept apologizing but he just kept getting mad so I canceled the call and then he messages me ""so you're just gonna give up on our friendship that easily huh?"". I told him no but we was making it hard to reason with him... 
  Flash forward to August 2018, I noticed I would get kind of anxiety when he would message me. Like if I received his notification, my heart would start beating faster and it would kinda hurt and I was scared of whatever I was gonna say was gonna set him off. I started meditating as a result of this, and honestly it helped. I also decided to stop smoking flower and all me and him would do was smoke together but talk about life and play video games and stuff. So uh, I started noticing he was giving me so much negative energy and that it was affecting me greatly. I told him that I needed some space from him and I didn't mean this in an offensive way but I told him he was too negative (Everytime we would hang out he had to be negative about something...like about his job, his dating life, his life). Obviously he seems depressed but I told him it was affecting me and he got very pissed off. He ended things with ""whatever take care"" and I said ""whatever bro take care"". 
Unexpectedly, he messages me in 2 weeks and he told me he loved me, that he was sorry about everything and that he missed me. (BTW I'm gay and he's straight...I had a crush when I first met him, but it either left or I tried to ignore it) and that made my heart warm. I honestly didn't think he'd come back or care. Well, I decided to put my mental health first and said "" well I love you too, but you're affecting me man. We can still be friends but just less closer I guess."" And that set him off again. He insulted me and he tried to call me but I didn't answer his phone call so he started calling me a pu*sy. I ended up forgiving him in about 2 weeks. We had plenty of arguments and I was always the one to say I'm sorry and to forgive him...he made me go into this dark place in my mind I feel... His ex girlfriend said he was kinda cuucoo cause he would argue about almost anything and he made up this whole pregnancy scenario in his head because she told him she hadn't gotten her period for 7 months (and they were not even together for 2). I don't know...I feel like he has some narcissistic qualities but he also has delusions and he feels like no one's suffering is greater than his because he saw his brother die in front of him and his dad died not a year after his brother. Obviously, he has felt loss greatly and I understand that. I tried to be there for him in any way, but all he would do was push me further away. He would also say I reminded him of his brother a lot and that kinda made me uncomfortable but it's alright. He wanted revenge for the lady that ran over his dad (she was drunk) and when he said that...it scared me. I usually think peaceful and all his angst affected me.
  Now, we don't talk. We got into this huggeeee argument because I slept next to him ( we were crossfaded and I asked if I could sleep next to him and he said yes but he was knocked out already. He usually sets up an air mattress). I confessed to him that I laid my head on his shoulders...and when I did he moved his head towards mine in his sleep and I felt this weird thing in my brain...like electricity. He started waking up as soon as I felt it, so I went back to my side. I knew he would get mad if he found out because he got mad at me just for a hug before that. I don't know what I left out, but I left out a great amount because it's too much and he doesn't want help. He always says I'm the one who needs help, I'm the one who's changed...and I have but I feel like it's for the better??? He says I changed in a bad way. We stopped all communication. We were arguing for a whole month...blocking each other (mostly because of me because he didn't wanna give me his truth and I wasn't gonna let that slide. I care about him a lot). I thought he cared about me...I thought he loved me...even as friends...I never saw him and I in a relationship because he says he's straight, I don't like to live in la la Land. I mean I do haha I'm highly imaginative but if it's not realisitic then why imagine it. I confessed my feelings to him during this month and he told me I needed to stop that if we wanted to be friends. We hung out for one last time like a week ago. He ignored my messaged for 2 days then came back when some girl ghosted him on tinder. I tried to tell him that if he wants to keep a girl he has to change his ways. I was just his friend and he caused an enormous amount of hurt. He got very defensive again and even called me an SJW and he said I was like Caitlyn jenner. He told me I have problems with my sexuality and that I need to stop imposing my gay tendencies on him...when all I did was the shoulder thing. I mean when we first started talking as friends, I asked to suck his dick LMAO...he got so pissed off...but right after the argument we still remained friends for 3 years???? It doesn't make sense. Someone help please. If you got any questions of him I'll answer. He says I'm the crazy one bit I doubt it since his ex girlfriend also thinks he was cuucoo.",11May2019,1

21,"Hi! 

**Basic information:**

Been on SSRIs for depression for about a year, and that's been going great. With my hefty share of ups and downs, I feel a million times better and I can't believe I survived such a difficult period of my life before seeking help.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm on 100mg of sertraline which is great, however at times I do come across very ''manic'' but looking online it's more of a hypo-mania than anything, and nothing bad comes of it. It's just times where I'm really productive and happy and upbeat, and so far I've been assuming that's just what 'happiness' feels like. I'm not sure that's the case anymore, I thought it might be due to the high dose of SSRI, but the internet seems insistent that that isn't the case.

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking about telling my doctor about it, but there's nothing wrong with these hypomanic episodes as far as I'm aware, so I wouldn't really want to be treated for it. They're a million times better than the remainder of the time where I feel shit and can't leave my bed. Is there something I'm missing?

&amp;#x200B;

**TD:LR** 

I'm depressed, have taken antidepressants for a year, have been having sort of 'hypomanic' episodes lately, do I tell my doctor to confirm this is what they are, if I don't want the ''hypomanic episodes'' gone/treated?",11May2019,5

23,"I’m 30. 
Me and a girl at work got romantic and pretty close. It didn’t pan out. I pussy footed around for a couple months. Then her life got in the way. Girls liked me here and there. But she made me fell needed. The heartache is intense.  

It just punched me in the face, that I’ve spent at least a fourth of my life stimming. (I’m being conservative here) I twirl pencils. My parents called it “flipping” and they used to get really mad at me for it. Made me keep my door open. So they’d know if I was flipping. Then they just started ignoring it. 

 It makes me have vivid daydreams. I feel like I could have been an artist if I had developed a talent instead living in a fantasy world. I don’t notice when I’m doing it. I had honestly completely forgotten that I still do it as an adult. Like I don’t even play video games or watch movies. I tried to learn music and computer programming when I was younger. I never got homework done. I would blame my failure on laziness. And not the addiction. 

 I have decent social skills. (I didn’t as a kid or teen) I’m monotone. But I can pick up on subtext fine. I’m quiet. But people say that I’m clever when I do talk. (The standards for wit aren’t very high in my redneck town though.) I don’t know how I fit into the Autistic spectrum. I was only diagnosed with ADHD. 

I’m really distraught. That girl made me realize that I’ve wasted the best years of my life pretending. At least in the beginning, she looked at me as a man. What would she think, if she knew all I do is spin a god damn pencil in my face? Her brief affection was something real. I never appreciated reality before. I didn’t even notice I wasn’t living. I need help controlling my stimming addiction. I can’t find resources. I’m so fucking sad right now.",11May2019,1

Sorry for the long read. Some of it is kind of a vent. But I do appreciate you reading it. Thanks in advance

  It feels really dumb typing it out, but it's really hard to explain. I am suspicious that I may have schizophrenia, and I wanted you guys help to know if It truly seems like a case.

  I \[18M\] thought it was just some weird thing that would pass. Well It's hard to explain, but I'll try my best.  

 I will give context to some things that seem out of the ordinary

 °I believe that I am watched by the universe and It constantly tests me. It's a constant competition between me and the other versions of me that live in other multiverses. These tests will define If I am worthy of achieving my dream. I don't know what happens if I fail them but they impact my future.

° There is a voice in my head. The previous voice in my head I used to call ''Devil'' left and this new one doesnt seem to be so strict. The voice sometimes announces  the tests and sometimes I just feel them. The voice encourages me to do it, but it gets kind of angry if I fail. They are mostly nonsense. I will give some examples that pop up in my head.

 \- I went out of the bath, got dried and put all of my clothes on. Then the voice told me that I was being tested and that I needed to get undressed and take another bath. I relunctantly did so. I took another bath after putting all of my clothes on. I got dried then It announced me that It wanted me to do it again. So I did it, thinking that It would give me advantage over the other version on me on other multiverses. 

 \- I row on a river nearby my house on the weekends. It takes me about 30 minutes to go to a tiny waterfall and get back. When I was getting back, the voice announced a competition/test. I would have to do my route all over again. I got out of the boat thinking: ''I dont wanna do this shit'' and when I did so I felt awful, like something bad was going to happen if I didnt listen to it. So I did the route again with extra effort to catch up to the versions of me that did decide to partake in the competition

\- I ask the voice if I should do something as simple as leaving the door open or closed sometimes.

\-I have some burn marks on my arm because when Im feeling like shit I believe I have to be ''reborn'' or some shit like that, and being reborn involves pain. So I need to cause pain in order to be able to get better. Some bullshit like that.

Everything has meaning. Its really degrading. Everything is influencing me. I mean come on

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like its important to say that I dont have any auditory or visual illusions. Not that I know of. Althought I do have to sleep facing my room because otherwise I would allow the spirit that lives in it to get me. Shit like that you know.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I believe that the universe in constantly watching and testing me. Everything matters. Me and the other versions of me that live in other multiverses have to perform weird tasks so that the universe grants us a step ahead of everybody (I think, im not exactly sure why it makes me do this). I also have this voice in my head that tells me to do what it says and gets angry if I fail, although when I am able to do it, the voice is pretty chill. I dont listen to it constantly. Its random. A lot of stuff. Its overwhelming

&amp;#x200B;

It seems kinda worrying now that I look at it. It's not normal. I think I should seek some professional help. I dont know if this voice influences me for good or bad. What do you guys think?",11May2019,6

26,"I feel like I have no other options left for help with whatever is messing with my head. I'm afraid of taking meds after seeing and hearing some friends and family go through some side effects ranging from minor to severe/nasty things. I've tried getting help to but that led me to not have much trust in psychological services even more. I had a school counselor who'd flirt with me (other guys too) and wanted to get in my pants rather than help, she later got arrested for having sex with a student while in the school. I tried counseling at college but they've turned me down more than they could help because they are either booked or looked fine to them. They then tried to bring me in yesterday but I was going to be at work and wasn't on campus the morning they wanted to see me. I do have a support network of friends but I feel like it will go away like the last one I had. I felt like a burden as I tried to vent and they were there to talk to but they suddenly stopped talking to me when I started going to vocational school. I wanted to get back in touch so bad but they ignored me whenever I was outside of school or just gave off a vibe that they didn't want to talk. I never tried to act better than them, it just felt like they said goodbye after I started going off to another school in the same day (Just to clarify, I went to high school in the morning, vocational school in the afternoon). I did gain what seemed to be another group of people I could call ""friends"". They had me in their group on occasions in class to just mess around and have a good time while doing work. The reason why I was included because I was from the same school with my former friend (He didn't and doesn't want to talk to me anymore. No reason given, probably because I talk to much). They started acting friendlier but then one day, they suddenly told me I was just a replacement for my former friend. I distanced myself after that. Still talked to them on occasion but it was clear I didn't belong. I tried to get along with the rest of my class but they seemed to not want me in their circles. I basically became isolated, only to be included when people needed help or when I needed help. I did make friends with two guys one year but one switched to morning classes while the other dropped out of the program entirely. I would reconcile with one of my classmates as she goes to the same college I go to. I sometimes vent to her and I do remember telling me why I wasn't included, I always looked busy. There is truth to that because I did some busy work as a way to cope with the isolation in the classroom. At the same time I thought that when others were busy with big projects, they still talked and had a good time. I still feel selfish for thinking that. I did then find one last person who seemed to understand me, but I fucked up big time. She was the first person I ever fell in love with, but I fucked it all up being a fucking idiot. I was too clingy, I was selfish, I said things I didn't want to say, I didn't know what to do. I was boring in her eyes.  tried to help comfort her in her times of need and even helped her get away from the police one time when they were detaining her mom (she broke a restraining order just to see her daughter). We're still friends and I feel happy for her now since she's finally managed to clean up her act and sober up a bit more and found love again. But at the same time, she treats me like I'm a toxic person despite her being toxic at times too. We're both toxic people. I want to see her again and hang out like we used to, movies, food, music. But every time we tried to schedule time to hang out, she just brushes it off to the last minutes and says she has other plans. I would ask a week to two weeks in advance and then she would go out with other friends or her boyfriend. I feel selfish again for saying that. She's the last remnant of my old support group, not including my former classmate (she's more a part of my newer group.) I have a new group now but I feel like I'm living a lie of what I am. I look to be a more energetic, awkward, and happy. I started unraveling myself bit by bit to them in a bad way. I snapped again one night. I have what I call a bit of an alter ego or personality (I don't know what it is but it's a separate entity in my head that sometimes takes control of me. I still see, feel, and hear everything most of the time but don't have much control, think Norman Bates from the 1960 version of Psycho. It only has started developing since senior year of high school from the isolation. He came out once before to someone I met online. He comes out more when I'm writing.) He basically took control and made notes making me aware that he exists. I panicked to a friend and sent him pictures from the event because I wasn't sure what the heck to do. I needed advice on what to do. I had the cops visit me for the first time along with one of the dorm directors. I just felt ashamed in the aftermath for being stupid at what I did. I felt stupid for not knowing what to do. I felt like I just did it for attention when I just didn't know what to do as it was the first time he actually drew himself and wrote down brief phrases. Everything calmed down after that for a while as things calmed down. I would eventually go back to feeling normal after the calm. Then I started to just go down a spiral. I think things hit bottom when I came back to school Sunday. I broke down in front of a couple of friends where I had the cops called on me a second time. I got off campus Tuesday night but came back Wednesday to do one last radio show for the year. I feel like I broke down twice already including today. I feel so alone at home. I'm scared to come clean with my family because I'm afraid I'll be sent off to a mental hospital like some other poor soul. I feel like I have to suffer in silence and alone.",11May2019,1

28,"Hi, everyone. I'm pretty sure this will just get lost in a sea of posts on this forum but I figured I could give it a try.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have (diagnosed) anxiety and (undiagnosed but super obvious) depression but I think these might be tied to some larger thing, don't get me wrong I'm not like ""oh I'm crazy, I'm so quirky uwu"" (gag) what I mean is, in the past when I spoke to my therapist, I heavily filtered what I told her (cause I didn't trust her all that much) and I wonder if I may have been suppressing/hindering my own access to proper mental health assistance.

&amp;#x200B;

In a nutshell, I have two voices, M and C (first letters of their names), in my head that play a dominant role in my life via decision making, forcefully suppressing memories, comforting me when anxiety is high, etc... M is super sweet and motherly in a way and C is kinda mean, but she's better now than she used to be, and she keeps the demons away while M prevents me from paying too close attention to them. I know ""demons"" is super cringy and overused but it's what I've been calling them for years and the name stuck. The demons like to rouse up the memories I don't want to remember, cause panic/anxiety attacks, and basically raise hell within my mental state on the days where my depression is really bad. Occasionally M and C heavily influence my personality depending on what situation I'm in and how mentally exhausted I am BUT I'm certain that I don't have dissociative identity disorder because I don't feel a ""switch"" like I've seen it described. My mom is schizophrenic but I don't think I have schizophrenia since again what I'm experiencing isn't how I've seen it described.

&amp;#x200B;

Woke up next morning feeling a lot better and went on about my normal routine. Fast forward a week later, I had my second panic attack. I thinking to myself what is happening? Why am I having another one of these. I called 911 and the rescuers told me that I may be having anxiety/panic attacks. So I went to the hospital and they did blood work and they found that I had hyperthyroid. So they gave me meds for the panic attack and meds for the thyroid. I went to my doctor and told him about the thyroid problem and he decided to do tests of his own. When the blood work came back, it showed that my thyroid were fine. He then told me that he thinks the doctors at the ER was too quick to diagnose me, and said that I was having anxiety attacks. Told me to stop the thyroid meds and to take my anxiety meds and depression meds. So I did, I’m currently still taking them. They seem to work good. However I would have rapid heart beat. It felt as if my heart was about to pound out of my chest. Weird part about this is that, I was having an anxiety attack or panic attack. I would be completely calm due to the meds working well, but having a rapid heart beat. It would range from 90 to 125. I’m thinking to myself something is off. Like why the rapid heart beat if I’m sitting here watching tv calm. I went to my doctor and told him about this. And he tells me it’s just the anxiety causing the rapid heart beat. I asked him “even though I’m not having a panic attack or anxiety attack?” He told me yes. I don’t know how true this is.

32,"None of my counselors are suprised I grew up and developed tons of mental illness. A lot of the time, it makes me feel emotionally incapacitated as my family often treats me as though I'm mentally handicapped and can't made decisions or have valid emotions because I'm ""mentally ill."" Instead of compassion, I often get ""well did you take your medicine?"" If I tell them something that's very real to me and upsetting to me.

I have an extreme anxiety disorder. Dogs barking, tapping, and auditory, irritating sounds will overwhelm me extremely easily, and to extreme levels. Thoughout my entire life I've wished I were deaf so I wouldn't burden everyone with my panic attacks over auditory overstimulation. In elementary school, bullying got so bad that I developed my anxiety disorder and got physically sick. I had to be taken out of school.

I lacked social skills because my parents wanted to shelter me from people, so I was a target for intense bullying and had no bearing on social skills or parameters. 

I suffer from ADD, so movement like someone picking at their lips, bouncing their leg, or TV's (any motion) will completely stop my thought process and I'll focus 100% of my brain on that distractant. Obsessively thinking about it.

I'm so obsessive. I have intrusive thoughts, and I'm constantly battling with my brain getting stressed about things. Like the placement of objects stresses me out. If there's 2 identical water bottles to choose from at the store, I may grab one and realie the 2nd is colder, but feel guilty for keeping the second bottle and putting the first bottle back. I'll obsessively think about that bottle like it has feelings. ""If I put bottle 1 back, I'll feel guilty. But if I put the 2nd bottle back, I'll feel guilty for that water bottle."" It's absolutely asinine. They're not sentient. 

I'll obsessively have thoughts, like if a dog barked one day, I'll still be thinking about the dog barking. And work myself up. Or if something happened 6 months ago, I'll randomly get an intrusive thought and OBSESS over it. All day I'll replay the situation in my head until I get heart palpitations from being worked up.

 If I get frustrated or pushed to do something, I'll feel manipulated and have an intense reaction, feeling zero control and getting scared that it is going to blow up and they'll abandon me. But I'm making it blow up. 

Anything that troubles me, will be obsessively on my mind until I drive myself mad and get overwhelmed and hate myself for inconveniencing anyone around me.

If something triggers my PTSD, I become a different person. I go back to being my high school self and panic. I talk different. My outlook on the world is different. It's like I have 2 people inside of me.

I feel like this... Less than person because of these things. 

I'm impulsive. I'll do things in the moment that I'll regret later. Like stealing a pen from work, or a ring from the lost and found cus because I'm angry at the world. Or driving dangerously. Or being defiant at work. Or having an attitude with my parents. I'll feel guilty afterwards... and apologize sincerely. But I do it because I always feel like the world's ending in that moment.

I feel like this... Freak.

Like there's 2 sides of me.

The loving, interesting side that loves my friends and my parents (their current selves), and am happy go lucky. And the polar opposite who hates the world and wants it to burn and says these horrible things on impulse without even meaning to. Like a cobra fresh out of the egg-- I spit more venom than I mean to. And destroy all my bridges.

I feel like my boyfriend looks down on me, and so do my friends and family. Like I'm just... This broken shell of a person. Who taps their fingers obsessively, eats extremely irregularly, bites their cheeks, obsesses over weird things, obsessively showers to be clean.... And has anxiety attacks over stupid things.

40,"Using throwaway account for sake of privacy.

If this isn't appropriate for this sub, I apologise. Please note that I am not seeking local services. We know all the available ressources which are unfortunately rare in my area due to big budget cut in healthcare. Also I sorry if my post is a little messy, English is not my first language. 

My 5 years old nephew have some serious behavioural issues but we have a hard time getting a psychiatric evaluation, since there's a long waitlist (over 2 years), and we are trying to figure out what he might have how to deal with him.

It's like he has two people inside him. One seems aloof, detached, in his own world. The other is violent, cruel, and uncontrollable. 

Often he is sitting in his corner, not paying attention to anyone, just playing, in his own little world, then suddenly he is chasing other kids, animals or even adults and trying to truly hurt them. Punch, bite, kick, hit with objects, often aiming for the head, the eyes, and the groins.

While the violence itself is disturbing, it's his whole attitude doing it that is disturbing. He's laughing. Like an histerical laugh. The more the person or animal is hurting, the harder he is laughing. We often have to physically restrain him by hugging him from behind, then he will scream, try to hit you with his head, try to bite you, and try to kick you. Then he suddenly calm down and goes back to his aloof self. Often he will ""crash"" after a long fit, and end up fast asleep within minutes. 

His sudden violent fits are generally often triggered when there's other children or animals (especially dogs) around. 

He's verbal, he answer when you talk to him, but shows very little emotions when is not having a fit. He looks at people in the eyes and doesn't seem to have sensory issues (we explored the possibility of being on the spectrum. Our first theory was that he was having a fit during a sensory overload but it doesn't seem to be the case. He doesn't show any sign beside being aloof/in his own world. We had a friend, who is a teacher specialized in children on the spectrum, spend some time with him, and she said she never really saw a kid like him before)

Also beside being violent, he doesn't really throw temper tantrum. Like if you ground him, put him in timeout, or scold him for doing something he's not supposed to, and he's not during one of his violent fits, he will apologize (again being very aloof doing so), and do whatever you ask him. 

It's started at around 2 years old. My sister thought he was just a moody kid, but it worsened once he started school back in last September, to the point where school is talking about either changing him to a special education class or litteraly force my sister to send him to another school. She put in a request to have a psychiatric evaluation but there's only one psychiatrist that can do evaluation for children in my area and there's so many requests that there's a 2 years waitlist.

We tried to search Google to have some idea of what he has, and I thought, why not ask a reddit sub who help people with mental illness. I know you can't diagnose people, but a few leads about the potential mental illness he has could help a lot. My own theory would be a dissociative identity disorder, but I know this is rare and I'm most likely wrong. 

Additional info: their GP has personally refused to suggest any possible diagnosis because mental illness in children is not his field of expertise and he doesn't want to misled us. He's pushing to have my nephew at the top of the waitlist since he's starting to try to hurt others in more dangerous way (using objects to hit them, like heavy books and scissors). It's so bad that my sister is considering home schooling until they have more help. He's not taking any medication at this moment because the GP needs a psychiatric evaluation to be able to prescribe anything.",11May2019,1
41,"My situation is extremely strange and a little hard to describe. My parents divorced after years of issues when i was younger (about 9 years old i think). My mother is a hardcore evangelical christian and my father has been a very outspoken atheist for some time. He's also extremely emotionally manipulative and abusive and once upon a time, extremely and unfairly intelligent. 

He's never laid a hand on me, but i kind of wish he was just violent instead. He never had substance abuse issues, he's got his PhD and some other tertiary qualifications and is in very good shape physically even now almost 50 years old (the guy can do like 50 pullups its really weird seeing your dad physically eclipse you).

Anyway, he's a paranoid schizophrenic. Possibly also bipolar and if you ever met him you'd wonder how such a person exists. Nobody in my family on either side (especially his side) will talk to me about him so most of what i know is guessing and from interactions with him. I'm almost 20 and have seen him a handful of times in the last few years.

I'm going to skip out on a looot of the details but basically, one thing i was told is that he wasn't always like this. He suffered a major brain injury sometime in his early 20s, and in his late 20s suffered some pretty major anxiety and depressive episodes. He was allegedly medicated but didnt take his meds properly or had bad reactions and my mum let slip once he had been on Xanax and at least 3 other different benzos and antipsychotics.

He's not been medicated for anything for over a decade and is in total denial about his state of mind, believes he is the only sane one.

So basically, what do i do? I had a really minor head injury when i was 11 but i was told that there was almost no chance it had any repercussions. I've partied a bit too and done some drugs a few times but never had any issues with self control. The only thing that scares me a bit is i have pretty bad anxiety and chronic reccurring depressive episodes, ever since i was young. Never been medicated but i did see some psychologists.

I know that i'm approaching the age where mental illnesses begin to really manifest. I have a partner of 3 years and going who i love more than anything and dont want her to have to endure even a fraction of what i did. Do i need to see a psych?

If it is a hereditary illness... Is there anything i can do to stop or manage it and still have a normal life?",11May2019,1
42,"Does anyone have advice on setting boundaries about texting? There’s a girl at my youth group  that I have helped during times when she was depressed, and it made her get really clingy to me.

She texts me really depressing stuff every day. I have told her that I’m there to support her, but I can’t be her counselor and it would be best to seek professional help or see her school counselor because I need to set boundaries. I also told her that I would prefer her to not text me past 4:00, because I need some time for my own after spending all day at school and I can’t be getting texts at 2:00 am.

&amp;#x200B;

I may be the only person on earth experiencing this in the way that I am. [I've](https://I.ve) search forums for years trying to find someone experiencing the same issues with no success. Most of you are probably going to think that I'm ridiculous because my ""self harm"" doesn't threaten my life or even cause much physical pain, but the pain that I cause myself is all in the mind.  I haven't I told anyone about this, so here I go.  

In fourth grade everything was going perfectly until one day. At recess a friend of mine showed me that if you bite on your pinkie and press down on it causes a little zing of pain for a quarter of a second. A normal person would try it once, laugh it off and live the next eighty years or so of their life without trying it again.  Not me. I spent the next 4 years torturing myself with this. I would consciously bring my finger up to my mouth, apply pressure, and press down a hundred times a day spiraling me into the feeling of being trapped in my own mind unable to escape.  Don't confuse this with a nervous habit like my mom and one time therapist did. **The best way to describe it is the feeling of wanting to do something after someone tells you not to do it. Not because you want to do it, but because you've been told not to.**  I was making CONSCIOUS effort to cause pain that I knew I didn't want to experience. The worst part about it is the feeling that you will never be able to break free from it.  I know, it sounds stupidly ridiculous, but it seriously destroyed a huge chunk of my childhood, and the same feelings are starting to destroy my adulthood.  

High school was awesome. Couple good friends, teachers that weren't TOO nice so I could justify fucking with them, and about 5 loves of my life.  There was one weird ""game""  that my extremely try hard edgy friends would play.  It basically went like this, find the most fucked up thing that you can on the internet and win. I saw heads decapitated, women stoned to death, mutilated genitals, etc and none of it bothered me the slightest. These were the years of my life that I enjoyed the most and I envy this version of me.

Lets fast forward to 3 weeks ago. Lying in bed. 2am. Watching Lana Rhoades do her thing when a very familiar feeling of terror surfaces over me.  My gut sinks down and my peripherals fade black.  *The ultimate fucked up video*. Not a specific video, but a video that I knew was out there. Something that I had to see simply because I hadn't seen it. Its the last thing I would ever want to see but for some reason the demon inside me had to see it. This was the EXACT feeling that I experienced before. **I was telling myself not to do something which fed my urge to do it even more.** Its what I knew would burn into my eyes the most and I somehow had to fight off the urge of opening the new tab and typing it in.  **I felt like a recovering heroin addict with a full syringe in my pocket.** The rest of the night was the most painful experience of my life. I had never felt so trapped in my own mind. I seriously wanted to blow my brains out.

So here I am laying in bed as the demon on my left shoulder argues with the angel on my right to look it up.  I would consider myself suicidal, but at times like this oblivion sounds infinity better. I take comfort knowing that I'll be dead one day.

46,"So today I went and hung with some friends and we were all chilling and hanging out then me and one of my friends got into a screaming match like we usually do. Not aggressive in any way just yelling random shit at each other. Then eventually I started to get really annoyed and angry and I ended up choking and almost fighting him. Luckily my friends got me off and I went off into a huge crying fit. I broke my friends garage door and cried like a child into his dad's arms. It's a good these where my best friends and basically my brothers so they were all their for me because it literally came out of nowhere. I know it was because of stress and other life things but what happened, did I have a mental breakdown or did I have a really aggressive anxiety attack or is it something else?? The reason Im so confused is because when I was doing it I didn't feel like I was in my body at all. I was thinking clearly but my body was acting on it's own. It felt like those morbid thoughts you get like what if I just hit this guy with my car or punched this kid in the face, but I actually did it. I half way expected myself to snap back into reality like nothing ever happened but it didn't. It was a really crazy and scary experience and I just want to know y'all's take on it",11May2019,2
47,"This is a real story. I guess this is where this starts I choose to tell the absolute truth this time, no covering up this time.
Here's my outline 
No friends ""they ain't out there"" 
I can't even wear whatever color I want 
""I don't want to see you in just black""
Can barely do what I want just go and read the text below.

One time I was looking for something to make a book cover I was walking towards the closet and opened it and my family member said ""don't look in there ain't nothing but some junk""
I got annoyed so I walked out and lone fucking behold she said these words that still to this day piss me off ever so slightly at best it annoys me and at worst it just makes me feel absolutely terrible, horrible even.
""See God don't like kids being ugly he put something on them."" seriously fucking seriously and the other stories down here will make that phrase sound so hypocritical. 

Another big thing that happened to me is, I was trying to be more gothic/emo and another family member was complaining about me being so godamn emo oh he wears black oh he wants friends oh he doesn't fucking want to be held up in a fucking apartment all the fucking time  being isolated and being controlled by the devil ohh am I being controlled by an evil none entity that they believe exists any way she said ""worship the devil."" ohhh yeah because worshiping a explanation of why people suffer and are unhappy is evil right 
Anyways she continued about this worthless shit 
And said ""yep it's all about devilish stuff"" so I said no it's not and she got SO fucking defensive over a true fucking statement 
And she this stupid as fuck thing"" if you ask me they all like that""  ohhhhh fucking ohhh 
She thinks and feels like that towards emo's and goth's but idolizes abusing, isolating kids because of her beliefs right so in her context if it's not Christians its okay you know if a Christian mom or dad is verbally, psychologically, emotionally abusing a kid it's okay right there with God they know better there not evil right? Seriously she never brings up how religious people can be very terrifying or abusive or horrific, evil people no people who wear all black and white makeup are the evilest people right you know they're the evilest kind of people they don't abuse or isolate their own children.
And then she said, ""and then you want friends."" 
""They ain't no friends that shit is dead they ain't friend."" 
And another thing "" you don't need no friends you just need him"" I assume she means God? 
Okay. Okay, so I have to be isolated because? 
Of what no I don't socialization is needed and as fucking soon as they find me talking to someone online you don't know them 
That really gets on my nerves.

Another thing that REALLY is terrible and just disgusts me is, I know it is their opinion but this is not right it's just awful to me 
One time during the summer another member of my family said this about people who are suicidal to her friend on the phone ""they just want attention they need to talk with God"" and they're being controlled by the devil? What no fucking no 
That's not right that's downright disrespectful to say I can get praying or talking with God it still angers me how she just says that and the whole the devil bullshit seriously? No he doesn't exist and the only reason he is rumored to exist is to again explain away and to control people and make people obedient, you don't try to tell people that about serious, mature and real subjects as depression or suicide 
I swear it's like fearing the monster under your bed levels of childish stupidity seriously
Satan fucking controlling peoples emotions.
 I don't know it's not right to say in my eyes it's just delusional to me I don't enjoy how people seem to use religion as a way to inflate their ego and make them seem smarter and more knowledgeable and stronger I know religion is needed sometimes and can actually help 
I know it helps I my self am 
Agonistic or however it's spelled sorry for the misspellings.

51,"Backstory: When I was 11 years old I was diagnosed with chronic depression, anxiety, OCD, and ADD. The next couple years were filled with trying different medications and many setbacks, but eventually we found a combination that worked for me; Vyvanse and Sertraline (Zoloft) in the morning and Sertraline and Trazodone at night. This worked for many years and I truly believe it helped me through my teen years. However when I was about 20 years old I decided to stop all of my medications alone. In hindsight, yes I’m aware that this was incredibly stupid. But I felt better. I thought I was ok and I was tired to feeling drugged all of the time. 

Fast forward to now. I am 24. Out of nowhere my OCD has gone from 0 to 100. It is mainly contamination OCD now, mostly regarding chemicals. However, I also have very intrusive thoughts about varying subjects. I am terrified of being near chemicals and then being near my family. I don’t want to touch anything in my house that is a “communal” space. I am terrified of bringing harm to not only myself but my loved ones. I do not want to expose them to the threats I feel are around. As typical with OCD, there is a part of me that knows my fears are irrational but the “what if’s” are overwhelming and soul crushing. My parents and SO are supportive, but understandably they are getting fed up. I don’t want to drive everyone away, especially because my compulsions revolve around keeping them safe. As an example my current fear is ant poison. I walked near and possibly on some ant poison then I came into the house. Now I am terrified the carpet, my bed, my dog, and pretty much the whole house are contaminated. I know this is irrational but i can’t stop myself from washing and cleaning what I can and just avoiding areas that I can’t wash or clean. 

I am completely worn out and I don’t know how much more I can take. I am trying to get set up with a psychiatrist and psychologist but I keep being told places either don’t accept my insurance or that there are no openings for months. I can’t wait months. This is completely taking over my life again and I don’t know what to do. 

If anyone can share helpful tips or stories of them dealing with something similar that would be amazing. 

TL;DR: My OCD has reared its ugly head after many years of being essentially dormant. It has manifested in new ways (and the old ways that do not include contamination) and i am searching for people with similar stories and advice.",11May2019,2
52,"This is a rant/cry for help.

I don't know what to do with my life. Seriously. I don't know why on earth I exist. It's an understatement to say that I have identity issues.
I recently turned 25(F) and will be finishing my psych degree in the fall. Thing is, this is not the right degree for me. No degree is. Psychology just seemed the most interesting. I hate people. I turn into a different person when I'm around people for too long. I end up snapping/yelling at them for literally no reason other than I am overstimulated. And it doesn't take much for this to happen.
I have been nothing but mediocre my entire life. My grades have been either average or poor since middle school. I have no talents. I'm not good athletically, I can't sing, very poor at playing instruments, not good at art, poor at math, etc... I can never stay with a hobby long enough. Nothing sticks.
I was the opposite of popular in high school. Ever since childhood everyone else has been superior in every way. In my 25 years I have never had a high point. I've never ""peaked"". My parents expressed their disappointment in me as a teenager. Whatever shriveled-up relationship I have with my parents is a strained one to say the least. I have no emotional connection with them, never have.
I'm just now finishing my degree when it should have been completed years ago. The only reason that didn't happen is simply because of my own choices. I thought I didn't need a degree and I could just work immediately. Obviously didn't work out.
I don't have a job right now, largely because of my inability to deal with people but also because my school work load is too much right now. I can't even pay rent. I use extra loan money from school to support myself. I have no idea how I'll pay that back. I live in a complex on my parents property. They probably did this because they feel pity for me. My older brother (32) moved out at 18 for college and never moved back in, he's very successful in his life. 
I have to wrack my brain to think of activities that make me happy or bring me satisfaction. I like video games and my cat. That's essentially it. In terms of a career I literally don't know. I have no motivation or interests.
My boyfriend of 5 years is such a nice guy that tries to help me with my problems but theres only so much he can do. I fear I will just do nothing but disappoint him in our relationship.
Sometimes I figure I'm better of just being a housewife because I can't do anything else. Other times I think it's best to take my life. I'm not good at anything. I don't know what I want. I keep feeling like I'm going to die young and not even experience the rest of my life.

I lived a fake life, when someone hurt me I smiled. When someone was hurt, I sympathized with them. That's how I ended up here. I have embarrassed myself and people in countless situations. It sounds weird listening to my voice and sounds weird when someone calls my name as If I had forgotten it. I led a moral life until now, God helped. I let go of my dreams one by one so I could have benefits in after life. I embraced suffering because there was some value afterwards. Now that I realized all religions are made up, I am alone.

58,"Alright, first time I'm truly putting this sensation into words so please bare with my spotty writing. 

&amp;#x200B;

To give a little background, I am a 21 year old relatively healthy female. My non-biological mother (we are not blood-related but she has raised me until the age of 18) has a slew of mental health illnesses that have directly impacted my childhood growing up in her household predominantly (divorced parents, so every other weekend at my normal father's house). We will refer to her with the alias \**Zena.* From as early as I can remember living with Zena, I have seen some fucked up shit. From stabbing her then boyfriend (my step-father) in the head with a pair of scissors when I was 7 and when there was blood dripping from his head, Zena and he started laughing and said ""don't worry it's a prop!""... to running down the stairs when I was 13 at 3 AM on a night of my birthday sleepover party, twitching viciously, with a chef's knife and the words ""whore"" written all over her nude body in red sharpie. I could write a whole forum on just these moments alone but we will refer to these moments as ""bad moons"" (what I would refer to them as since I was little). For as long as I can remember, when Zena would have explicitly violent bad moons (usually ones that require sedation of some sort, whether emergency psychiatric intervention or slipping crushed clozapine and valium into juices that I would have to coerce her into drinking), I would get overwhelmed with this weird pins and needles sensation throughout my whole body. After Zena is fast asleep and taken care of, I would just remember the most odd feeling of *floating* back up the stairs and going to sleep. It was as if I wasn't even the one walking. Sometimes I wouldn't even realize how I got back into my own bed, as if I was in some type of limbo outer-body sleep walking trance?? It was just so passive, I almost felt like a robot with no self awareness. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today. Sometimes (and over the past 3 years or so) I get in this weird, similar trance- like state of mind as when I was a kid floating back up those stairs. These trances come on during random times. During intercourse, at work in the middle of doing something, during very engaging conversations with friends. My eyes don't go cross-eyed and I just blank out in the middle of a task. It's not like that. Rather I continue on with the task but I lose the self-awareness that I'm even *doing* it. This has happened so much more often lately in conversations, which must be equally frustrating for whoever I'm talking to. For example, I will continue with the conversation, crack jokes, be normal .. and then 5 minutes later get looked at like i have three heads when I say ""Oh we've talked about that before"", as it'll be the topic of conversation we just had. This is especially stressful as I have been in a fresh relationship for the past 9 months, and I truly love my partner. However, because of these ""zone outs"" in conversation, he thinks I have zero serious interest or care about what he has to say because I ""forget everything."" I just use a cop- out and blame it on my ""pothead memory"" but I smoke about 3 times a month, and I am very aware it is not that. Sometimes I even get confused looking in the mirror because I just look so.. foreign. It sometimes takes me a while to even realize that it's me?? If that makes any type of sense.  I have been told by numerous people over the last year or so I seem very ""out of it."" It's gotten to the point that my father has had a sit-down intervention with me because he thought I was on heroin (??) because I am so quote by quote ""out of it all the time"" (does heroin even do that to you???)

&amp;#x200B;

I am also starting  through these random moods where I don't want to speak in the middle of the day (and I am a VERY talkative extrovert, known by all my friends as the funny one). I feel in a weird sense that I'm shutting down... may I add these ""shutting down"" phases in the past were comforted by an excess of eating food, which led to 85 pounds of weight gain making me morbidly obese 5 years ago that I have since kept off (thank you ketosis). However, I secretly always knew it was a bit deeper than me just eating my trauma away from dealing with Zena's bad moods. 

The excessive eating of the food and the motion of actually ingesting food made me feel alive. Right down to the extra feces I produced from eating all these extra foods and the stretch marks that starting forming on my skin from eating all these foods made me feel more ""real""... more human? More alive. I'm literally trembling as I write this, and I have tried to lightly introduce these feelings of not feeling ""real"" to my close friends before - and I just get stared at like i have six heads. 

On a separate note, suicidal ideation has always been pleasant type of thought I often find myself smiling to in the shower. The act of dying does not particularly appease to me (as they are not and nor have ever been **active**, suicidal thoughts) but rather the thought of people remembering me... as a *human* life that has since passed. There's a lot going on right now, such as legality issues which are taking a very heavy toll on me, to questioning my being from an existential standpoint, to the stress of college graduation in a week, to stepping on eggshells with every little thing I do regarding my father (completely sane, normal parental figure) whom I will being living with full time as I move back home from college. While I have a lot on my plate, I feel, rather... I **know** this is a lot more than just my anxiety building this time around. I have handled high-stress situations all my life but this feels different, and I think I should acknowledge it while I still have a grip on reality and recognize this is not normal before I completely become unaware of it.

But it's been quite a long time since I started feeling the way described in the screenshot. And it's a one-to-one exact replica of what I feel. I thought the lack of concentration was due to some other reasons. Is it really due to depression? Have I always been depressed on some levels?

67,"I'm not sure if it's reasonable to waste the doctors time and risk messing up my brain. I have chronic anxiety and I'm depressed but I can still force myself to do what I absolutely have to do. So even though I really hate life and wish I wouldn't exist I'm still getting by.

I've been on and off meds a few times, but I realized that I don't really want to get better. I was just hoping to to numb the emotions and make myself care less. That's not a good motivation. I know the psychiatrists here have to deal with much worse cases who deserve the attention more. I can dress okay, take care of my hair and living space. I spend most of my free time in bed, but when I'm forced to go outside I'm HYPER energetic and bubbly to the point you'd think I have mania, all while having terrible anxiety. As soon as I'm not around people anymore I become the complete opposite.

Plus it's hard to explain my psychiatrist what the problem is. I get the feeling that he doesn't like me because I'm ""too complicated"" due to having AvPD, gender dysphoria and possibly (undiagnosed) ADHD. I just feel terrible each time I go there. Due to medication anxiety I struggle to be compliant with medication that has amphetamine, opioid or GABA activity, so it's not going to be easier with less pleasant medication. I tried an antipsychotic once and it didn't do anything expect make the feeling of being overwhelmed and crushed by the world even more intense. It's really hard to take a medication and stick to it. It's really hard to fight the anxiety to get a refill. With all this contradicting information and views it's just impossible to decide if it's worth it and when it's necessary.",11May2019,1

69,"I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask, so apologies in advance. It's also kinda long.

Backstory, my girlfriend has a few mental health issues. She suffers from depression and has what she calls ""dissociation"" or ""depersonalization-derealization."" The best way I can explain it is that her body may be there at the moment, but her mind is elsewhere. She suffers from severe anxiety and panic attacks. She's on a few medications that I don't remember the names of, but one is the highest dosage of Bupropion. She recently started a new medication or upped the dosage on one of them. I'm not sure. She'll constantly dissociate throughout the day and have a panic attack. She's in therapy, has a psychologist. I think that's about it.

I'm not really sure how to explain it. I'm sure from an outside perspective it sounds crazy. Hell, it sounds crazy to me. For the past couple weeks, my girlfriend keeps ""remembering"" things I've apparently said or done. Only, the problem is, none of what she is remembering is true. Every single thing she thinks she remembers is negative, which is completely contradictory to our relationship. We've been together for 5 months now and it's the best relationship I've ever been in. I say this with complete sincerity, this is the woman I want to marry. We've never had an argument. We're constantly telling each other how much we love each other and talking about marriage and just generally being beyond happy being in each other's company. She is my soulmate and everything I've ever hoped to find in another person. I love her.

Sound crazy yet? Let me give you more details. Every memory she's told me about is very vivid and detailed and she sees it very clearly. She has one memory where I've apparently told her I think we should take a break so she can get her mental health under control. I've never said anything remotely like this. I'm constantly telling her I'm here for her no matter what and to talk to me if she starts getting ""fuzzy"" (what we call her dissociating). Another memory is me sitting around with her family talking shit about her, right in front of her. Again, this never happened.

I've tried explaining to her that none of it is real. That all these negative ""memories"" should be a dead giveaway that they're not real. I'm not sure if she believes me. She keeps trying to go back into these memories and only digging out more negative thoughts.

My theory is that in each of these ""memories,"" she's really dissociating in that moment and basically daydreaming about these really negative events. When she comes to, she forgets about them, and for some reason, is now starting to ""remember"" them.

It's driving both of us insane. It scares her that her brain might be lying to her. It scares me that I could do or say something with her and she'll remember it completely different. I'm at my wit's end and don't know what to do. I don't know how to help her. This girl is my best friend and I hate seeing her in pain like this. I know she's not crazy. She just needs help. How can I help her? How can I prove to her these memories aren't real? What is really going on inside her head that is causing this?

TL;DR My girlfriend keeps ""remembering"" things that have never happened. Every ""memory"" is extremely negative and about us breaking up. I have no idea what's caused this or how to help her.",11May2019,10
70,"A little context,
My 13 year old sister has been battling with depression and late Wednesday night tried to commit suicide by taking a handful of pills. She got scared and ran to me and told me. We called 911 and she was admitted to a children's hospital and then admitted to an adolescent psych ward off campus.

She seems to be doing okay but I'm worried about her over the weekend with less group activities and therapy. There's a lot of ""room time"" and ""quiet time"" and we can only visit her a couple of times a day during visiting hours.

I know she is having major phone withdrawals and is also having withdrawals from her antidepressants.

I want to bring her something to read to help her stay engaged and comfortable (I'd be going out of my mind) during her downtime. I'm not sure what she'd like though.

She loves art and music. I don't know much else about her hobbies because her hobbies include being on her cell phone 24/7. I loved reading at her age. I loved Wally Lamb and the first book that touched me was ""She's Come Undone"" but I can't bring her anything with themes tied into suicide, rape, self harm, drugs, etc.

76,"This is a bit long I apologise but need to clear my head:

&amp;#x200B;

So today my bf had a whole day of panic and anxiety. He was so worried about me going to work as his anxiety centers around his health and he's always scared he's going to have a heart attack and need an ambulance without anyone around to help. I should say - he's had anxiety for years and years, its always been the same fear, but since I started working part-time at a supermarket, he's been getting super anxious leading up to me having a shift. He was really upset, and so I felt like it would be like choosing work over him if I didn't stick with him through this.

So I messaged my boss that I couldn't make it in and would try to find someone to cover. I didn't go into detail but said that he was having chest pains (I didn't think she'd understand if I said I couldn't come because he was having a panic attack, she's not the most understanding in general). After a few hours I hadn't heard from her and sent her another message just apologising. She replied saying they were really busy and no one can cover me. At that point I checked in with my bf about it and he was crying as he said I should go, and I just couldn't bring myself to leave him alone. So I sent back that to my boss that I was sorry but I didn't feel comfortable leaving him alone, that he had panic disorder and that it was a scary and emotional time. She replied really bluntly and told me to ring the head of the store and tell them since she was no longer working. Well I called the store, spoke to the big big boss, and he said my boss was right in front of him. I explained that I couldn't come in and said I was sorry. He basically said there's no one else to cover it though. So in the moment, maybe because I'm a pushover I don't know, I just said that we were probably going to go to the hospital to have my bf checked to make sure its all ok. Soon as I said that he said if thats the case then its ok you don't need to explain any further. I haven't heard from anyone since.

&amp;#x200B;

So, ever since that phone call, I've now been having a lot of anxiety (yay today!) that I don't want to burden my bf with obviously as he's just got out of about a 7 hour long anxiety spiral. Now I'm paranoid and can feel myself sort of focusing and obsessing over what my boss might think of me now, that they think I made it all up, that I'm going to be in some kind of trouble, that they'll want some kind of proof that we visited a hospital, that they'll fire me... I'm spiralling a bit tbh lol. 

I don't know what I'm hoping for by sharing this but I just really had to get it off my chest and don't want to burden my bf with it. I also don't want to talk to my family about it because they're all pretty strict about work and I don't want them to judge him or me for not putting work first today.

&amp;#x200B;

I can feel this old urge to cut and run - in the past, due to depression, I always got overwhelmed by thinking I wasn't good enough and was a fraud at jobs, and would think everyone could see through me and didn't like me. I'd quit jobs after a couple weeks or months. This is the first job I've held where I've been here 5 months. I don't particularly like the job, nor my boss, and could find another. But I suspect maybe I'm overreacting and don't need to leave and find somewhere else just because of this?

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone relate? Advice? I'm a bit of a mess right now lol.

78," I was once told that when you start smoking weed, your brain and soul literally stop aging at that point at time.  
 

I've been smoking since i was 18. I have memories of getting high first  just because it was something that seemed like it was cool to do and the  other kids did it. LOL, those were the days. The peer pressure stoner.  
 

Then I got a little older and started feeling like oh fuck this getting  older shit really sucks. Well, i can get high and go to my happy place  and it'll suck less, for a little while. The emerging stoner.  
 

I got even older and started realizing that I could use weed to tell  beautiful lies to myself, and a lot of the time, it worked. I was able  to be myself easier, be funny, make girls laugh, have a cheerful and  funny disposition that saw humor in everything like the child that was  starting to fade, inside and out, even though on the inside i was dying  slowly and feeling like I had no true idea who I really was. A boy, who  was frightened of people and of a world that seemed very cruel and  foreign to him.  
 

In a week I turn 25 years old, a quarter of the average person's life on  this planet (not me tho bc i plan to pop myself @ 60 or whenever i can  no longer enjoy life to full capacity), and all I can say is I feel like  I'm a shadow of who I used to be. I feel disembodied, I look in the  mirror and I see the body of a man I don't want to be, because where did  the boy go, the boy who used to longboard and ride his bike around and  who thought that growing up would happen to everyone else, but not him.  
 

And I wondered why the girls never wanted me. LOL.  
 

It had to do with being a man, it's just that I felt like becoming a man  was sacrificing everything that made me me. When I lay off the weed now  I feel like I descend into reality and I feel incredibly dissatisfied  with my state of life. I'm not the same friendly person I used to be,  simply because i've been through so much pain. I'm trying to find refuge  in my soul somehow and I know that I need to escape the pit of myself.  Because it really is a pit. I want to share and love and create. I want  to meet someone and I want to give her the part of my soul that I  thought was dead. I'm trying to feel complete.   
 

Sometimes I wish I was a girl, because it seems like they have more of  that natural inner light. I feel like my light has all but gone out and I  feel like I love the masculine aspects of being a man that grant you  power and assertion in the world, but I hate the lack of subtlety and  callous nature that it feels like it's bringing on. I sound gay lol   
 

I guess I just grew up. But man it feels like living hell  . Schizophrenia runs in my family, but i mean, its not like i think the illuminati is coming after me or something ,i just feel incredibly out of it. What should i do",11May2019,13

80,"This is my first post here, and don't really know how to start out really, and hope this is how to do it. Also, probably kinda long.

4 months ago, I lost my job. I'm not a smart person, I can only do a few things, worked physical dumb labor my whole life and couldn't and still am unable to find something I can do. I can't deal with people that well, and all the jobs around here are working a cashier position or potentially having to deal with people directly. I can't do that, I can barely even talk to people I know sometimes.

My weight is out of control. I've always been on the larger size, but that was moreso just that I like to eat just a bit too much and was muscular. A bit of fat atop of muscle. Now, it's the other way around. I've gotten so overweight it's honestly been breaking me up. None of my clothes fit the same and I can't wear them right to make it at least look like I'm not as big as I can. I've gotten so far into being like this that I can't do basic normal exercises without hurting, 2 or 3 squats or 5 pushups feel like they've been multiplied by 10. (Want to say, this is my personal feelings, and I don't judge anyone on their body type. I dislike mine but am not shaming anyone for theirs)

To add to that, I'm a big, burly, hairy large guy, but I don't like that look. I don't even like being referred to masculine pronouns but I avoid that because I don't know how to really thing of it, it's all confusing and I just let it be.

In march, my boyfriend broke up with me, and I felt completely horrible. I immediately began to get sick, for weeks, vomiting multiple times, crying for literal days, nothing but horrible feelings. He admitted that he ""fell out of romance"" about a month before and couldn't ""recontextualize"" the feelings he did have before. The very night before said he really did care about me a lot. Turns out, he was just drunk. It took over a month to feel alright, or passable. But every now and again, things remind me of him. His favorite animal is(are?) bats. I see a bat, I think about him and how he wanted to work at a sanctuary. He's a huge fan of Pokemon and Fire Emblem, and I can't see anything about them without that thought in the back of my mind; how I felt so great but he didn't feel the same way in return for a while. Since then, I've thrown up at least twice a week. Sometimes, skips a few days, but I still feel sick even then, and eventually will just throw up. That problem still happens now. (As a matter of fact I did just an hour ago, if that) I don't feel romantic things really, takes a lot for me to, so it might hurt more than usual when it's off. Which sucks cause he's such a good friend but I can't stop feeling different. 

Set up an appointment with someone to talk it out but cancelled it.

Weeks after that, my car was totaled. Completely busted. Same day, found out my dog had failing kidneys, could die if he wasn't cared for correctly.

Weeks after, a friend of mine who I lost contact with for years came back into my life. They had a stroke just days later. With no way to contact except Twitter, he being in a different country and not responding or saying anything for 12 or so hours, I of course thought the worst. Then, began feeling the same way before it happened, then went completely dark, nothing. Thought the same thing too. Up until just yesterday when he posted he was alright.

And yesterday -- went to spend the weekend with my mother, have fun, do something, go out and get dinner on Mother's Day. I was completely fine, perfectly normal like none of this happened, an okay day. But suddenly, as soon as I get there, I felt tired, and took a half hour nap. As soon as I woke up, my stomach was hurting, I got sick, and as soon as I did, threw up in the bathroom, then was just hit with intense sadness. I, a grown adult big person was cuddling and bawling my eyes out holding my mother. I had to leave, she understood, and was upset and worried about me. Hated I made her feel that way.

I couldn't stop crying, she felt scared about how I was acting, tried her best to understand. I left the same night, I felt compelled to go back to my room at my home and just be there. I don't know why. I didn't feel comfortable anywhere except there. Not even in my own living room or kitchen or bathroom. Had to be my bedroom. I love my mother, nothing about her is bad to me, but I felt both like I needed to be around her but had to be away at home.

Last night, talked to a friend for a bit, told me she was a bit drunk, and was going to bed, sent a heart emoji, everything almost exactly like the very night before I was broken up with. I'm half expecting a text in a few hours that says she fell out of platonic feelings with me.

From feeling okay to complete sadness last night, this morning I feel a weird mix of being sad and yet no emotions. Like, a sad me is standing and watching an emotionless me, if that makes sense.

Basically, to wrap it all up -- lost my job and am broke, got fat and out of shape, feel funny bout who I am, got dumped, wrecked my car, dog got bad sick, found a lost friend to think I lost them again just days later, broke down emotionally in front of my mom and abandoned her.

It's easier to talk to people I've never personally met rather than anyone I know close to me, save for two or three people but don't want to bother them constantly.

I just needed a place to talk about it. Just so I technically haven't kept it all in. I don't know how to stop feeling like how I described above. Y'all wanna chime in, if it's allowed, please do, offer whatever you can, I'm at an end on my feelings. But I just needed a place to yell about it where someone will listen.",11May2019,1

I go downstairs because it’s almost thirty minutes past the time when she said dinner would be ready, and she’s asleep on the couch. It’s 6:30 PM. I wake her up. She’s completely out of it and can not get a full sentence out. I ask her three times if she’s still making dinner and she doesn’t understand what I’m saying. There are four empty glasses of wine on the counter along with a half empty bottle of vodka. I go and look in the kitchen, and she hasn’t even started dinner. We also haven’t gone grocery shopping in a hot minute so there’s no food in the house. There’s nothing for me to eat for dinner. I was already very upset, and also very hungry, so I just go back to playing Xbox. My best friend and I were in a party, and he asked me how dinner was so quick. And that’s when I just start bawling into the mic. 

My mom has done this twice before, but she’s always apologized after I wake her up and she makes dinner. This situation has never happened until last night.

93,"Don't look for happiness in others. Happiness will come when you challenge yourself to change the way you think, the way you act, the way you eat, the amount of exercise and socialization you get. 

EAT BANANAS: It sounds stupid, I know, but they're full of potassium and magnesium which is crucial to our mental health recovering. 

GET SUNLIGHT: You're a pretty little flower that needs lots of hydration and Vitamin D, so go for a walk for once (Pokémon GO has become a reason to get outside for me) 

WORKOUT: Yoga, bike rides, cardio, going for walks, etc. will all enhance your mood because your brain releases endorphins that are hormones used to create the emotion 'happiness' (It's also a pain suppressant, hence why why flex our muscles when pain surprises us.)

Look things up, teach yourself because nobody cares as much as you do and DO NOT GIVE UP! I love you all and I hope I can help at least one of you.",11May2019,30
94,"I'm very depressed at the moment and it feels like there's no way out this time.. My bf doesn't get why I can't get out of bed and he thinks I can control my own thoughts and should just focus on the positive. He listens, but he doesn't really, which makes me feel more alone. Over time, I've sent him some information about depression and how he can help me when I feel very depressed. It's just basic information, such as what not to say and explaining it's a disease, not just something I talk myself into.

My depressed mood and negative thoughts got worse the past few days. This has to do with my boyfriend's mom. She seems to be overprotective of him and even a bit manipulative.. This puts me in a position in which I don't know what to do. I'll describe one of many situations to explain this.
My bf has to go to the hospital next week to make an ECG of his heart. It's not that big of a deal, they expect everything to be alright, but I still asked him if he wanted me to go with him and his mom. He liked the idea of me being there for him, so he said yes. A few days went by and suddenly he said it's not necessary for me to join, because 3 persons would be a bit of an overkill, according to his mom. He still thought it would be nice to have me, but did agree with his mom. His mom said to him ""If she's going with you, I'm not"". Het told me to not take this personal, but I do.. 

I think his mom has gone too far telling my bf to make a choice. We could've easily gone with 3 persons, I could even stay in the waiting room. It hurts, because my bf doesn't really seem to go against his mother. He says ""My mom just needs to get something like this sometimes, and then she'll be happy for a while again"". I think that's immature and it's a sign of her being spoiled (in the past?). 
My bf is 21 and in my opinion he should be old enough to make his own choices and tell his mom it's not okay to say stuff like that. I've told him how I feel about this situation, but he doesn't seem to do anything about it.. 

Now he says he needs some time of his own, because it's getting too much for him (I'm depressed 24/7 the past few days). This, of course, makes me feel more alone, but I get it and just give him the space he needs now. It hurts..

I know this situation is a first world problem.. But it's maintaining being in this spiral of negative thoughts at this point. I don't know what to do, I feel like he doesn't understand me and this all makes me feel more alone. I can't eat, I sleep during day time and I'm awake during night time, which is keeping me in this spiral.",11May2019,3

I feel comfortable in the state of sadness engulfed in my own tears. I really don’t want to be this way, I would much rather go back to the happy go lucky girl I once was. 

I’ve been trying to exercise more often because I know that is a great way to help you mentally, but I haven’t been able to keep up with it. 

I haven’t seen anyone about my mental health state because I feel too afraid to be told something I don’t want to hear. I keep telling myself to wait to see if anything changes or I can make changes myself, but I’m stumped.

This happened to me when I was 17, so I have to avoid the number 7 and 17, and I have to avoid other things too. Years and years later I'm still haunted by it and the religious views I developed during it (I've since renounced and denounced them) 

My flashbacks are not as intense as they used to be but they're still there.

For a long time I couldn't go in my room because I would get severe flashbacks. I had to sleep elsewhere for a while. I eventually was able to re-enter my room. But I never felt comfortable in there, I had to rearrange my furniture constantly and I had to put blankets over my window to cover all of the natural light, especially the sunlight. (I already had this problem, but what happened made it worse). I've since moved out and as long as sunlight is not directly hitting my window I can be in my room, so I have to get out of there in certain times in the morning, but I have to have the curtains closed at all times. Sunlight entering a room in a lot of cases give me flashbacks

I can't do anything in 7s or 17s, just typing those numbers is giving me anxiety.

There's a lot more but I'll move on the religious part.

I tried to become a Christian, and immediately I thought that god was doing horrible things to me, I prayed so fucking much for it to stop and nothing ever happened. I heard lots of fucked up stuff, like that god was ""breaking me"" into the person he wanted me to be, but I didn't want to be that person he was trying to ""break me"" into. 

I was told to ""have more faith"" or ""you're not having enough faith"" when god wasn't helping me and I was desperate. I was told ""you're not completely giving yourself over to god"" ""you're not giving him complete control so he can't help you"". I tried my fucking hardest, but it was never enough, people just told me those things whenever it didn't work, which is a half-assed way of saying ""I don't know why it isn't working but I don't want to accept that Christianity isn't the answer"". 

I thought I had no control. People told me that god was ""using"" me to go through pain be a help to people in the future, that's the only way others could rationalize it for me. I was told I was going through ""spiritual warfare"". Basically I was told that Christianity could explain everything and it was the answer to everything, that I'd be okay as long as I ""trusted god"". 

I'd NEVER trust someone who would make or ""let"" all the things that have happened to me happen to me.

I went to church and thought that if I did, something would happen to help me stop constantly panicking and feeling so hopeless, to eat again, to not feel do desperate to die. Nothing happened, I asked people to pray for me and every time I was let down, making me think that god was just relentlessly trying to hurt me for a reason I could not understand. 

For years I couldn't step foot in a church without having a panic attack. Now I can but I have flashbacks if I do. There was a time recently where I helped out a friend who worked at a church, and I was able to stay in the church for an hour or two, so that's progress. But Every time someone mentioned something about Christianity before I had flashbacks, I still do, but they aren't as intense, I couldn't listen to Christian bands, I couldn't even talk to my grandpa (an overzealous christian). I still have a hard time talking to him.

Recently I actually, for some reason I have no idea about, became desensitized and almost became a Christian again. Then all of the sudden it all started flooding back, so I backed the fuck up. I don't know how I was even able to be in that state of mind. 

But anyway, here's where I am now, I recently was going through medication withdrawal, so I was especially sensitive, and I thought, ""what if Christianity is true?"" It sent me into such a spiral of panic that I thought my body was literally going to shut down and I almost admitted myself to a mental institution again.

I'm fine now but I still can't talk to a Christian who speaks FOR Christianity, I don't go into churches, I can't talk about Christianity for more than 5 minutes, so I avoid the topic. I get flashbacks from the huge number of things that I associate with christianity and the nervous breakdown, like numbers, of course the bible I just cannot read it, certain lightings/colors, certain songs/bands/albums, certain phrases, anytime someone says something about trusting God or god answering a prayer, some smells, some people, some places around town, etc. 

This is probably the longest post I've ever made.

101,"I (23f) just stopped taking my antidepressant/antianxiety meds after 10 years. 
I know it's a little early to be posting about me being off drugs completely since it's only been 2 months, but i am so damn proud of myself. 

I'm not sure of my exact diagnosis because my psych didn't give a shit and just fed me drugs. My ""mom"" has nailed it in her head that i am bipolar, but she has been labeling me since 13.  I believe boarderline personality disorder maybe even ptsd may be more accurate.

I have been on a shit ton of drugs since 13. Started with just the antidepressant then turned into multiple drugs; antianxiety meds, mood stablizers, adderall, other add medications.

Here's a little back story on why my mother decided to put me on drugs at just 13.
So i guess ill start with describing my relationship with my mother. My mother has always expressed her frustrations towards me whether it was my fault for pissing her off or someone else. She clearly has some psych issues herself (probably why she was so quick to get me on drugs). She is very narcissitic and out of line most of the time to the point where it's random when she attacks.  She can be the most loving supporting mother one minute then most evil fucked up witch the next.  In my 23 years of living she has never once apologized. Her way of apologizing would be to buy me things. (one example she had to pick up my bro from a night club he was kicked out of for being 16 and drunk af and since i was at the same club not even with him ((or drinking)i got YELLEDD at-as if i had any control over my twins actions.  Next morning my mom took me to buy a $60 bathing suit) It was OBVIOUS my (twin) brother has always been my mom's ""favorite"" child even to family members. I don't remember a time ever having a healthy relationship with her. I'm assuming it's simply the fact that she saw a lot of herself in me or because im her only daughter OR because i have always been so close with my father (My mom has resented my father for YEARS but stayed together for my brother and i till we turned 18). I'm not saying i was a golden teenager, but my mom was very verbally abusive even over shit i didn't do or have any control over. 

At 13, my mother's father became very ill. He was in the hospital for a little over a month. I did not know my grandfather that well as in i never really saw him growing up even though he was only 30 minutes away simply because my mom could never hold relationships with anyone let alone her own family. My mother thought allowing me to miss MULTIPLE days of middle school to be by his bed side every day would be the best way for me to understand/cope.(?)

When he passed i was so involved that i was holding his hand as he was taking his last breath.... a 13 year old who BARELY had a relationship with her grandfather had to watch him deteriorate in a hospital bed because my mom (a nurse) thought it'd help me...nope im convinced this is where our relationship has taken it's toll. 

Around this time of life, i was also bullied pretty badly at school. I would be bashed for being chubby and pale. (13 yr old bleached whale.) I would come home and sleep for 15 hours easily. (I know now this is pretty normal for teenagers) I would also cry over any little thing. I had NO control over my crying....or so i thought. Around this time my mom sent me to a psych and i was put on an antidepressant. She tried to get me to go to a therapist ONCE but never again because i bashed her in the session and she didn't appreciate it. (Now i look back and see i was not victimizing myself like she always said i was, but i was speaking the truth that she could not accept others knowing) I'm not sure how i got away with 10 years of being on medications and no therapy but i do not suggest it one bit. I'm fucked up. 

I was never given ways to cope with my issues, i was just given pills. I was never told that it was ok to not be ok. I was never taught how to speak about my feelings or understand them and because of that i still don't know and it has strained and continues  to strain multiple relationships of mine.


Fast foward 8 years.  I couldn't handle my mom even on drugs. She went as far as saying I'd be better off dead. Talking shit about me to her friends/MY friends/their parent's when i would be in the other room. She would be bashing me for mistakes I've made and/or making fun of the things i said in response to her abuse as if it was so funny i reacted to her abuse instead of just taking it.

Shortly after this, I packed up my shit (basically just my clothes) and drove 600 miles away to live with my dad's parents to get away since my dad did not have room for me in his apartment. 


Life was better for me emotionally for a bit without the abuse, but i was very lonely and felt like a burden on my family by just living there no matter how little i was there or how much i helped around the house. I've only seen my dads side of the family a handful of times because of the distance.
With this move, I was so lonely and my self esteem became lower than it was. I felt as if i did not belong anywhere. At this point, i gave myself to anyone who would give me the attention i lacked.  Because of this I ended up having a drinking problem for over a year, gained about 30 pounds, and jumped right into moving with someone i barely knew.  There are so many things and even people i don't remember during this time because i was so fucked up ""drinking my feelings away"". I have had more suicidal thoughts these past 2 years being on my own than i did growing up in my moms house. 


600 miles away doesn't take away the pain of abuse.

You can't run (in this case drive) away from your problems.....

My most recent email (blocked her number) with my mom was me trying to explain to her how i feel and her telling me that ""my thought process is altered.""

Don't fucking let ANYONE tell you that your feelings are invalid. 

The abuse my mom has put me through is practically imprinted in my brain like the ABC'S. 
 
I can't even bring my mother up in conversation without balling my eyes out in anger and pain. 

So what made me stop taking my medications? 
My will to make my life better. 
In my 10 years of being on drugs I have had way to many suicide thoughts/attempts to believe that these drugs are still helping me.   I do not want to be numbed anymore. I want to feel my emotions. I want to understand why i feel the way i do. I want to learn how to deal with my stresses and anxieties, not just mask them. 

2 months off medication after 10 years and I'm ok. I feel like my brain is more open (not sure if that makes sense). My excessive crying is not so excessive, still senstive but controllable for most part and I am not excessively sleeping. 


I have learned that i am allowed to react to stressful situations. I am allowed to cry over something that makes me upset. It's perfectly ok to not be ok. I am NOT alone. 

I'm no where near where i want to be, but just knowing i have control over my emotions  helps me believe that one day i will be exactly where i want to be.",11May2019,0
102,"I've been reading about Avoidant Personality Disorder and I DON'T think that's me because I don't have social anxiety. Maybe I do, but I love being around people and going to events and things I'm invited to. 

But, I love to avoid everything: healthy food, working out, difficult work assignments, arguments with friends, cleaning. Additionally, I lean into things that are not healthy: over spending (I have $43,000 of debt), too much drive thru (once a day usually), drinking a full 6 pack of beer in one sitting, things like that. I need some help and some direction.

I've been doing some reading on general addiction strategies. Because, it gives me a pure high to avoid wants good for me and delve into something completely unhealthy (like junk food or canceling plans with a friend). But, I don't know where to turn or what strategies to implement.

Also, I cannot confide in a human in my life about these issues for fear that they wont be able to help me but instead I would have poured my soul out to someone with no assistance in return.

103,"Okay....from a rational perspective, maybe I need the right triggers in order to be productive and reach the desired result, but if you were me you'd know that I'm struggling through a mist of hazy thoughts and crippling self-doubt and a constantly shifting mindset. 

I fear this infinite ignorance and the intolerance for people like me. However, as pathetic as this is – yes, my perpetual whining – I find little comfort in the knowledge that I could end it any time. We all have a killswitch, so why shouldn't we be free to use it? 

I don't have even a fraction of the life experience I wish I had, and it can be ascribed mostly to my thinking instead of taking action. To myself, I'm sorry, but you are well aware that I have this dark cloud of fear looming over me, waiting, just because. 

When it rains, it pours. Life is supposed to be hard. If your life is easy, there's a glitch in the matrix.

106,"Switched back to Wellbutrin 150mg x1 daily (2.5 years after switching from it for little to no reason) after stopping lithium and Lamictal cold-turkey. I’m not bipolar, they were sinking me further into depression (I have major depression), exacerbating my anxiety and I felt like I was in an almost constant mode of being triggered and hyper vigilant. My feelings of isolation increased and I rarely wanted to be away from home.

It’s been 3 days since I started it and I’m already feeling better. I’ve had little to no withdrawal symptoms from lithium or Lamictal. If I do, it may be in combination with the side effects of the Wellbutrin which have only been some sleep disturbance/minor insomnia, headache and fatigue. I had lost all hope for my life and desire to live. The passive suicide thoughts were frequent to constant and killing me (no pun intended) I was questioning everything and everything that I thought I deserved/wanted in life (like wanting kids but doubting I should due to my struggles). 

Those are slowly dissipating and it’s such a relief. I feel like I can breathe a little easier. I still have the racing thoughts but they are also slowing down.

107,"A few weeks back I was finally able to get in contact with a psychologist. I held back from it for so many years due to toxic family upbringings and potentially untreated behavioral problems. After a few sessions, my psychologist told me that I may have depression, among other problems. One of my main issues is how this has been effecting my life, before I even had a therapist.
 Growing up, I never got the best of grades. I wasn’t a troublemaker or got into any fights; I was a very timid, quiet, and reserved child. The issue was just my schoolwork. I could never be able to sit still, and I couldn’t pay attention to anything for more than 10 seconds without my brain moving to something else. I’d get easily frustrated with something I wouldn’t understand and just move on to something else unrelated, most likely videogames. I would be able to sit and play videogames for hours at a time, but I could never direct that level of focus to my studies. Growing up, much hasn’t really changed. I ended up going to summer school a couple times in middle school and in high school because I could never manage to get anything higher than a C or D . Now I’m in my second year of my community college and it’s been stressing me out and making me very anxious. Last semester I got barely any credit because I burnt out and crashed halfway through the semester, and stopped attending class. This semester is coming to and end, and I managed to get some credit for it, but the grades definitely are not the best. I fear that the cycle is going to repeat itself and I’m never going to reach my goal of attending a university and living life the way I want to 
  Now, the reason why I brought this up is because of why I’m attending college in the first place. A majority of the reason is because I live in a very strict and toxic family so education is placed on a very high pedestal. Another reason is because I I truly want to become an artist. When I first entered college, I was undecided. I was just going with the motions and just taking prerequisites without really much of a purpose other than the fact that I really had no choice but to be here. I find it really hard to make decisions, so I was always going back and forth between majors. I m pretty sure all my friends were sick of hearing me switch between an accountant, a physical therapist, etc. Then I realized that I really love the arts, so I’d really much rather take a major within that field. I plan to do something within the range of animation/illustration with some graphic design as well. Issue is, my conditions have been proving it quite difficult to deal with.

    Like I mentioned before, I have a pretty short attention span and I can’t really sit very long before wanting to catapult out of my seat and start bouncing off the walls. My energy spikes are pretty random as well. I either go from feeling like molasses to wanting to run 4 laps around Jupiter, there’s no in between. Due to this, I lack a lot of patience and discipline, something I’m sure most artist really need. I’ll get easily frustrated, often times looking at other people’s work and letting my inner perfectionist get the best of me. If it doesn’t go my way, then I’ll just quit and play videogames and not go back to drawing for at max a few months. This gets worse whenever I try to draw digitally. I have all these resources in front of me but I can’t ever seem to just sit and get the work done. And what makes me feel worse is that I enjoy doing it, so why can’t I bring myself to focus on these tasks? If I plan to transfer to a uni, I’m going to have to create a portfolio, and I really don’t have much to show for at this point.  I’m wondering if it’s just me lacking discipline? Maybe school isn’t for me? Or maybe I should keep art as a hobby. I plan to see a psychiatrist as well, but until then this is going to keep eating me up for a while. Any inputs or suggestions?",11May2019,1
108,"I don’t know how to start, so I’m going to briefly introduce myself. I have stalkers, so I’m not gonna be as detailed. I’m gonna delete this account as soon as I receive enough answers. I don’t even know if this is the right sub...

I’m a 22 year old female. I consider myself an INTP (Myers-Briggs/Carl Jung) and I have ADHD. 

I recently graduated and I don’t want employment. I don’t know if it’s depression, anxiety, or just the way I am (I’m an INTP and we’re considered “lazy”) I would rather think, read, and daydream all day. I also have a bad attention span but I don’t know if it bc I find most things boring or because I actually have ADHD. I am kinda impulsive though and my brain is always “on”. 

I’ve tried several medications. 

Adderall made me lose 28% of my weight. It helped with energy and motivation but I still had a hard time focusing. Vyvanse was ineffective. Concerta had a negative chemical affect but improved my focus. I can’t describe the affect but it was terrible. It wasn’t  a “numb” feeling people often describe but I will say it’s something similar. Magnesium helped with the “feeling” but it made me lose focus. Prozac helped with motivation. Bupropion stabilized my mood but I didn’t like it because I like being kinda moody. Guanfacine helped with attention but I kept having random flashbacks. 

I also tried supplements that affected my chemical make-up. Each supplement had a different affect depending on the current med I was using. 

I’m currently just on 80mg of Strattera. It helps with my mood and attention. But it could be better. 

I probably can be considered a Schizoid but I do desire social interaction and I hate being the way that I am. It’s why I started to get help four years ago. 

Honestly, I should’ve gotten help at least 10 years ago. My parents and teachers didn’t care. As long as I was making good grades and being a “good kid”.

I just went full on crying with the snot and stuff and she seemed visibly shocked and concerned because prior to that i was talking in a calm manner.

110,"Hi, I'm a 26 year old white male who seems to be struggling with a mental health issue. I've been avoiding social situations to a high degree for the last couple years and most of my social life currently comes from interacting with my parents and speaking with a therapist. I quit my job 2 years ago and have been out of work since and haven't been looking for a new one because of my symptoms. I've also lost friendships because of my avoidance so I've had to deal with loss.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically at my last job my symptoms were beginning to show and I was becoming noticeably anxious and I would often pace around a lot to try and settle down my anxious energy. I knew something was wrong and I felt a lot of shame about the fact the my symptoms were beginning to slip. I ""fit in"" OK at the job but my suspicions that people were beginning to notice was likely true. I worked at a sales job and one co-worker told me ""bro, you're going to scare the customers with the way you're acting"" and another who was a friend of mine asked me if I had ADHD because he said I was like a ""rabbit on coke"". Another co-worker told me I was ""acting weird"" and asked me why I was acting the way I was acting. I just felt so anxious around others and I was desperately trying to repress my symptoms. Again, I quit my job because I didn't want to deal with the potential embarrassment of more people taking notice. Ever since then though I often avoid everybody outside of my family and a therapist I began seeing a year ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

I notice I also have a ""low sensitive mood"" that comes over me sometimes. When I do go out and try an be around others I feel like a low-level sadness or sensitivity or something. Like I could start crying for no reason. I'm really trying to ""better myself"" through therapy and my own self-help. I do deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation daily and this really keeps my body relaxed and calm. I do mindfulness meditation occasionally and it sometimes helps, I think. I don't practice it regularly enough but I've heard good things. With my therapist we're working on CBT and exposure therapy but I don't actually do the exposures because of my ""mood symptoms"". She's trying to figure out what my core beliefs and self-talk is and this hasn't gone as smoothly as I've hoped. I've began reading the ""feeling good handbook"" by David Burns to try and speed up the process. I've  also began taking a natural supplement called 5htp a couple months ago and I'm not sure if it's helping. 

&amp;#x200B;

So basically where I'm at right now is I have effectively gotten my ""anxious body symptoms"" down around others purely through relaxation techniques but I still have an urge to avoid others and not look for a new job because of other ""symptoms"" that are hard to pin down. I'm a physically strong guy but I feel so emotionally vulnerable right now when I try to be around people. I'm so fearful of my symptoms showing or me embarrassing myself or making a fool of myself that it is literally hindering my ability to function right now despite being physically healthy.

&amp;#x200B;

Is anybody on here willing to chat further with me about this so I can maybe go further in depth? Or are there any useful resources you could point me towards besides a therapist obviously? I have a habit of sometimes ""looking up symptoms"" to mental health issues to try an self-diagnose but I know that's not healthy.",11May2019,1

I'm listening to some lovely music ([https://youtu.be/4eJ\_lbAGeSM?t=3575](https://youtu.be/4eJ_lbAGeSM?t=3575) if you're interested) and thinking about how I am now. Things have been pretty shitty the past, maybe 6 years or so. Not as bad as most people have it, but personally pretty bad. I don't know if I'll relapse back into something worse again soon, but at least for a brief moment I've been feeling ok lately. Things don't feel quite right, but there are elements of my experience that were causing me a lot of problems and pain, and lately I've been at least content or accepting of these feelings or have been more apt at dealing with them. I wish the best feelings upon all of you, is all I feel I can really give back right now. I wish I could do more for others.

I didn't have the privileges or maybe I did the mistakes, but I will never be the Perfect Man. I will never be loved.

I'm letting go of that option. I will never be loved. That's one door that will always be closed off to me. I will never be good enough. That's okay. Sadistic people can tell me otherwise, but I'm better off accepting this option rather than keep asking why it hasn't happened yet.",11May2019,1
113,"I’m not even sure if this is the best place for this. Sorry. 

Talking about my mental health, as well as other people talking about their’s, makes me nauseous. I can’t help but compare my situation to other people and either think I’m pathetic for feeling the way I do, because they have it worse, or I think I’m defective when their situation appears better than mine. I can’t win. 

I feel invalidated if I believe someone else is struggling more than me, like I have no right to feel the way I do. At the same time, I think I’m a failure when someone else seems to be doing a bit better. I know I shouldn’t compare my situation to how other people are doing, because everyone’s recovery is different. Also, someone may appear better/worse but I can’t exactly be sure, it’s none of my business anyway. 

I avoid movies about mental health, people with mental illness and I can’t even look at leaflets about getting help with mental illness without feeling anxious. I do my best to talk to doctors about it, because some of my symptoms make loads of things difficult for me. However, I stopped talking therapy after a few sessions so I just see a team of doctors (psychiatrists) every week. I’d rather not say what I’ve been diagnosed with or what my symptoms are. 

I have no idea how to overcome this, because at the moment I’m detained under a section of the mental health act so talking about mental health, and being exposed to other people who also struggle with their mental health, is unavoidable. I’ve been here for months and I’m still not used to it. 

I also believe I would benefit from talking to people with similar experiences if I could just stop comparing myself to them. People could also benefit from hearing about my experiences too. I wish I could change but have no idea how to achieve this. 

I’ve considered reading loads of stories about mental health every day, hoping to get used to hearing about it and to attempt to force myself to stop comparing myself, but I probably need to be drunk to even start doing that. Unfortunately, alcohol is not allowed on the ward. 

Tl;dr: I keep comparing my mental health and my recovery to other people’s mental health and their recovery. This makes me feel invalidated, and just bad about myself in general, but I can’t stop. Any advice?",11May2019,1

But everyday, when I wake up in the morning, the first thing I think about is ""I can't wait to sleep"", I have shitty sleep during the night anyway, daytime sleep is way better.

I get up, drink coffee (coffee doesn't keep me from sleeping for some reason), and just... Wait. And once it's past 10 am. I'm like ""okay yay lets go to sleep"". And I just sleep until my body won't let me anymore. But even awake I just lay in bed and listen to readings of creepypastas and spend time on reddit. I don't have a job, and I blow off my friends so I can sleep instead. 

I'm really not sure if this is an issue.

I am depressed, full of fear and anxiety, OCD, and other mental problems. I just sleep before these things can get to me. Once I'm asleep they can't hurt me, until I wake up. I hate being awake. I really do. Being conscious is a pain in the ass. I do want to die, I have for so long that I can't remember what it feels like to want to live and sleeping is pretty much the closest thing I can get to death besides suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

To provide context, I'll try to explain the run up to today as briefly as possible: 

I'm a 21 year old (F) undergrad, living in the UK.

I have had the worst \~4 years of my life. Since starting university in 2015, I began on a path that lead to total self-isolation. I had a breakdown in the summer of 2016 before exams. Then I met Sarah, who I lived with for 2 years. Ended up relying on her emotionally, she turned out to be toxic and used me for her own self-gain, destroying my self-esteem and self-worth in the process, as well as ripping apart the friendships I'd built because they were all based around her. I had a two-year fucked up relationship with a guy who had bipolar; I genuinely thought one day he would try to strangle me in my sleep. I only stayed with him for Sarah's approval or as a distraction when she wasn't around. It was horrible; he cheated, lied, was admitted to psychiatric wards several times. It was a horror show. I quit my degree because I was failing, changed course and university, staying in the same city. Eventually I moved out of my flat with Sarah into a new flat with people I didn't know. There, I met Lindsay and we were kind of inseparable but in a healthy way; we took our friendship very slow, then started doing our laundry together because she lives in my building, going on nights out etc. We met in December and have built a solid friendship, it's nice. I had some debt problems over the last year and ended up getting into online gambling, gambling away my student loan and I couldn't pay my rent. That took its toll on my mental health and my parents' wallets. They're amazing for paying it for me, they couldn't afford it but they did everything in their power to keep me in university because they know that's where I need to be. I love them so much and to prove to them that I was worth it, I got my shit together, for them. For me too, but they're what kept me going. I built myself up from the bottom, I got a job that starts at a stupid time in the morning, it's only 2 hours a day but it's something. I studied really hard these last few months, got firsts in all my assignments and I'd been studying for my exams. I was doing well, I barely needed half marks in my exams to come out with a first overall (second  year of university).

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, I had my last semester 2 exam. I bought some weed, a bottle of prosecco and made fajitas to celebrate because I'd been on a strict revision schedule. All I was doing was studying and it paid off. Apparent from my Monday to Friday job, I have nothing to do. So, as an introvert, I started watching TV on my own, just chilling. I started thinking about how much I've achieved and how much things could of gone south and I kept persevering and all of a sudden, I got hit with a wave of emotion. I was having these flashbacks to every single time something awful has happened to me, in the last 4 years and my childhood (was a bit rough), it was so vivid and I felt everything. I'd never had anything like that happen to me. I then went into a full-blown panic attack, which I'm familiar with, I tried to calm myself down. I made some food and started eating, and I kept eating until I felt physically uncomfortable. I then went to the toilet and made myself vomit until I wasn't in pain anymore. It's not the first time that's happened, it probably happens at least twice a week and I thought nothing of it. I'm constantly eating, I feel guilty that I eat and then throw up until the guilt goes away. I hide what I eat from people, I sneak into the kitchen and I sneak food. It's uncontrollable for me. Had another panic attack so to calm myself down, I went to the bathroom to get some water. I put the hot tap on by accident and my tap gets super hot, almost scalding. Automatically, I shoved my hand under the hot tap and held it there until the pain was unbearable. I didn't even realise I was doing it, I've been doing it every day, multiple times a day for years and now my hands are disgusting and blistered. I never thought it was a problem. I cried a lot yesterday, I was shaking. Happened again this morning too; had to call Lindsay and she calmed me down. She's gone home for summer so there's not much she can do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lindsay thinks I should book an appointment with a doctor. I said I would because I agree, sometimes I do get worried what will happen. Like, I'm not at all suicidal, my anxiety is way too high to consider death. But I feel scared, I'm honestly terrified. I don't know what I'm scared of but I don't feel safe and that's alarming. If it was a week day, I would've gone straight to my GP but it's a weekend so I have to wait until Monday. 

&amp;#x200B;

Will I sound like a hypochondriac if I go to a doctor? I don't want them to not take me seriously. I feel like it's probably just silly and I should get over it and carry on, since everything is technically absolutely fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

To top it off, my mum just got home from hospital because she had an asthma attack. She's got health problems and she overworks herself, so she neglected her medication. The terrifying thing is that my parents are divorced, my mum doesn't have a partner and my sister isn't in contact with mum; I'm all she's got. So I've got the weight of that to deal with and I feel like I'm on the edge and I don't know what to do or where to take it to. So I'm asking a bunch of strangers on the internet, because I feel like I need an objective point of view, from someone not involved in the situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I've been on sertraline and mirtazapine for depression and anxiety for just over 2 years now.",11May2019,1
117,"I'm currently in a crisis, no friends or family, long term relationship on a break/possibly ending. I struggle with abandonment issues and have no one else to turn to.

I'm struggling to stay safe, do I go back to A&amp;E, or call the ward? I have a mental health nurse visiting tomorrow morning, but I don't think I can wait.

118,"Venting. What I'm about to talk about may be triggering: it includes suicidality, self harm, and sexual and physical abuse... I feel like it's about my mental health in general so that's why I'm posting here. 

I've never made a post here before but I really need support. I'm trying to get an appointment to see a therapist or something but it's a hell of a process. Idk why it's so hard for me to find somewhere to go. I have a great life and I want to be happy, I just have so much pain. I mean I have so much shit flying around in my head I don't even know where to start... I constantly think about suicide, sometimes while I'm at work, and lately it's getting worse and worse. I am starting to have a lot of trouble controlling my tears, and my anger--well, I'd call it rage at this point. Basically, I've always been a pretty angry person. Warning: This will be long. I experienced a lot of abuse at the hands of my dad when I was growing up. 
It really started when I was around 6 and he called me a fatass, and I do have a weight problem now, but I didn't as a child. By the time I was 10 I was wishing he would kill me and get it over with, he hurt me so badly. I was homeschooled, I had 3 sisters then 4. My mom worked after 2003 cause my dad started experiencing chronic pain in his back due to a herniated disc. He also had a psych history. 
Anyway, he started abusing drugs, and he was most pleasant on marijuana but mom didn't like him doing that, at one point he was doing meth. He was very aggressive, anxious and I often question if I am remembering correctly, because I remember being afraid so much, just wishing for the day to end and mom to come home. We would tell her he hurt us, but she never believed it. I was a quiet kid, and we were all ""good'. People would tell our parents we were great kids when they saw us. My dad would accuse me of things I would never do, like steal, and he'd force me to lie before he was satisfied, and then he'd beat me. Every morning if the dishes weren't done the night before, he'd get up and make a huge racket and come in our room and yell at us to get our lazy asses up (7-8amish, which is late for public school people, but tbf we begged to be in public school at times). If the dishes were done but there were some sitting in the drainer, he'd yell anyway. Basically anything he could come up with to be terrible to us. 
He beat me over multiplication, and he favored me over my older sister whom he'd hit with whatever he could find. She was my half sister and not technically his child, although he adopted her when he married my mom when my sister was 2. He was nicer to our younger sisters, but meaner as they got older and sometimes just as bad to them. Rarely to the baby. 
When I was around 11 I started scratching myself on my arms in a self hugging position until I drew blood. My parents saw this and it obviously really hurt them, they loved us, my dad really did I know, but he was just sick himself. They asked me not to do that. My favorite cousin died when I was 12 and I became obsessed with death. I continued to self harm but with other means. I'd hit myself, still scratch myself, use pins and knives and even a screwdriver. I rarely cried when I was sad. My dad would often be even more mean when I cried. So I'd get very angry, sometimes I'd go numb. I'd hurt myself for release I think. It essentially all changed when I was 15 and my mom was pregnant with my youngest sister. 

We found out just days before this event that my father molested my older sister multiple times between 8 and 16. My sister was in the kitchen whilst my mom was home, scrubbing the floor. My dad stood over her belittling her. Very brutal words but mild compared to how he treated her sometimes. My mom tried to defend her and my dad attacked my mom, put her in a chokehold. My older sister and I tackeled him to get him off her, scratching and shit, all the damage you can do as a standard 15 y/o girl. I tried to call 911 because it was bad. Couldn't get through because we had the phone disconnected because he couldn't stand the constant calls from telemarketers and debt collectors (we had a lot of financial problems). He tried to charge me but mom got between us. He got called out about the molestation, started ugly crying. He was gonna leave, like LEAVE leave (my parents had many near misses where she almost left, she was in denial)... My mom let him stay. 
From that day on he didn't even talk to me and my older sister anymore for the most part, and didn't hit my younger sisters although was still verbally and emotionally cruel to them and all of us after a while. Slowly he changed..
I wanted to go to art school but I couldn't afford it, didn't have my license, went away to the nearest liberal arts college where my parents would drop me off because of a tution guarantee (work-study college). I visited infrequently and only for my sister's sakes, my father was cautioned by my mother to be nice to me on my visits or else I wouldn't come back. Finished undergrad, got married, attending master's school for social work. Work in a psychiatric hospital on an all male unit. Last semester was the hardest semester ever for me. I worked full time, full time course load, and practicum in the same psych hospital. Was in the psych hospital 6 days a week. No idea how I survived that. I was 'crazy busy'. 

I still visit my parents, and my relationship with them has gotten so much better, especially my dad. He doesn't abuse drugs or my siblings anymore, or me. I don't worry about him hurting my baby sister at all. He is sometimes mean, but he's a mean person. He's had a surgery for the herniated disc because it took years to get that far medically and financially, and he's a much better person with a little therapy. I don't hold what he did against him, but it's hard to let it go when I still suffer from the pain of the memories, I've never had therapy. I almost went to anger management when I was 15, but it never happened ultimately because my dad said I was just being a big baby. Mind you I was throwing chairs and leaving horrible scars on myself at the time. 

My problem now is that this haunts me. I am practicing washing dishes without getting angry. And I'm practicing controlling my anger in general. I think this last semester was too much. And I'm not sure if my job is making it better or worse, but it is making me aware I need to get help. I have constant breakdowns that are over seemingly small things, but I neglect problems until I build up so much stress I explode. Sometimes it's frequent and getting moreso. I've thought more and more of suicide since graduating undergrad. I love my husband and he is an angel the way he supports me. I cry uncontrollably now, and it's been recent years that I can even cry at all so that's amazing. I have come close to killing myself several times and I get closer every time. Sometimes while driving I just scream in frustration. Yesterday while my older sister was visiting we talked about my in-laws being crazier than our family and all the stuff they've put my husband through. I ended up having a breakdown about that which involved screaming and expressing vague homicidality. I just feel, as I've felt for a long time, that I'll get worse and worse until I finally kill myself. Many days I think ""I'll do it today when I'm alone, why not?"" I can't stand the pain anymore. It feels like the world is not worth being a part of. There's so much pain and suffering, and there is no satisfactory explanation or redemption for what I experienced as a child. My family doesn't even talk about it now, although we almost now seem like a healthy family. My mom would probably still deny it... 

I want to get help and I've tried making an appointment with a therapist a couple times, but I always get scared and back out. My work provides five free visits to a university provider, but I showed up there and didn't even find a parking spot, got overwhelmed, started crying, and drove away. My insurance is so limited that there are few places I can go, and it's hard to get an appointment. I have one at the end of June. I'm trying to find a solution until then to help slow me down. I feel like I'm getting worse when I breakdown. My husband said he'll drive me next time... Idk what I want, just to share. Support maybe. Because I've been hiding this about myself and I want to get better so I want to start opening up about it, but it's scary to talk about it to people. My older sister helps to talk to, and my best friend, and my husband, but I just wanna stop being afraid of talking to people about it. I guess I get scared people will just tell me to move on, get over it, etc... Because my life really is great now although it has taken a lot of time and work to get there... I just want to find peace inside, where not every negative event is torture, and I don't wanna feel like dying would be better than waking up the next day every night I lay down to go to sleep.",11May2019,1

The point of this post is not to get any diagnosis, but maybe someone deals with something simulare, and could give some advice. But if not, I still feel as if I needed to vent a bit.

So, I experience a recurring thing with shifting personality. I keep creating these different personas. One month I am Emo, then 1 or 4 months later i'm Hippie. Suddenly I become Ghetto or Scene. I even have a Cabaret persona and a Fancy Literature and Art Enthusiast persona, and even more. I for the most part don't give them different names, though 2 of my personas have their own Pet names (Faggetron and Ecspen$ive). And quite honestly It's becoming frustrating and exhausting. Cause if it was just fashion, then It would not have been a problem at all. But they have their own political opinions, hobbies and interests, heck they even (for the most part) have their own dreams and variety in speech. I am aware that they switch, I am fully aware when I've changed persona, but which one (if any of them) are the real me? And besides music, what triggers them. 

I do however have my own theory as to why it happens. I'm thinking it must be a way of coping with past and present physical and mental abuse. Though If that's the case, I have no clue as to why I would use it as a coping mechanism.

Whether it's when I'm around friends, or next to my crush, I just hate the way I am. I'm like a social ghost, I'm there but not really there. It's like I'm ethereal, without a presence. I'm too quiet, I don't have anything to say or I'm just too shy/slow to react. And even if I say something, I can't sustain people's attention and they move on to whoever is more talkative or confident.

What sparked me to make this post was my crush. My crush is talkative, but she's better friends and more talkative with others. I'm just unremarkable and quiet, and I can hardly get closer to her because of it.

One of the things that has prevented me from seeking help or feeling able to trust a therapist (in the US at least) is this damn sword of Damocles that hangs over anyone's head the moment they say ""I feel like I want to die"" or ""This situation/thing/feeling make me want to kill myself"".

There is no point in going to therapy if the therapist is intent on making my life take a turn for even worse by sending me to a hospital against my will.

That said:

I'd like to know if there is, in any US state, some kind of document or legal protection I could seek that would release a therapist of this stupid, moronic and defeating ""duty"" to report me if those words come out of my mouth.

130,"My depression has often made me feel worthless, and I feel that way right now. It's a daily occurrence for a lot of people. We tell ourselves that we are not worthless, that we have value, that we are important. But is it true? Most of us live for over 60 years but we make our lives so small and meaningless. Most of us spend the bulk of our lives working. Working for what? The betterment of society? The fulfillment of our passions? No. We work meaningless jobs for other people in return for shit pay. A lot of us will never get to do the things that we want to do. Instead, we spend that time earning money for other people so they can do the things that they want to do. We wake up at 5am to commute to a monotonous office job where we have to take abuse from our bosses just so we can continue being able to afford food and a roof over our heads. We spend hours, tired and stressed, in overcrowded public transport just to get sexually assaulted by some piece of shit on our way to work. Ultimately, we spend the best years of our lives working for other people. And what makes it even worse is that we have it good in comparison with people in other countries. I'm sorry but does anyone else see a problem with this?",11May2019,2

137,"Have you ever do something you don't want to do (studying, gym, game), and as soon as you start doing, you enter into a flow state and you can't just stop? 

It happens to me with a lot of things. Last night, I decided to study after neglecting it for weeks. I have to get up 8 am next morning. But I can't stop studying until 3 am. I NEED to understand this thing. 

Sometimes, I will start playing a game. I will play it with minimum eating and sleeping for days, until I stop and leave it for months. Sometimes, I start obsessing over someone, I will constantly think about her for weeks until I stop and don't give a fuck anymore. It also happens with many other things too. Things like sitting infornt of the computer for 7 hours straight because a hobby project I am working on is not finished, is pretty normal to me.

It seems like a general lack the ability to self control. As soon as I start doing something, I can't stop. My sleep cycle is f**ked. It is not good for health. I can't create long term good habits. But when I am in that flow state, I am very productive.

It is not normal, or is it? None of my friends is like that. What is this phenomenon called? Does it happen to you often too? I want to read more about it on Google, but English is my second language and I don't know what is the term to describe it.",11May2019,1

140,"I feel incredibly selfish, uncaring, and lazy because I don’t keep in touch with people, plan for special events, take the time to mark down birthdays, or go out of my way to buy a birthday card. I think about people all the time, but don’t pick up the phone or make attempts to keep in touch. I planned birthday parties for my kids through middle school, but since then I don’t plan for special moments, and when I think about doing it, it feels like a huge inconvenience to me and I procrastinate until it’s too late to do anything truly meaningful. So basically, I don’t care about them or the special moment more than I care about my own time. What is wrong with me? How do I start caring and WANT to do this? How do I change? 

I truly care about people; it’s the ACTION and showing it that I have trouble with. I feel proud of my children’s achievements, I brag about them, but my eldest child’s community college graduation is coming up and while I feel immense pride, mostly what I’m thinking about is that it’s going to be hot and outdoors and uncomfortable and that I really should plan a big celebration but it’s “hard” and “inconvenient” to me. OMG!! How awful is that?!

Bit of background: Diagnosed with ADD a few months ago, medication is helping, but this problem lingers. Divorced mom since second child was born. Kids' dad has always been the vacation dad, so I am solely responsible for raising two good human beings. One is 2nd year of college, the other a junior high-school.",11May2019,1
141,"Lately I've been holding a needle under a torch and pressing it against my skin because it feels good. At first I did it as a way to escape how I was feeling because of a breakup but now I'm not sad anymore, but I do have a constant desire to hold a hot needle against my skin. 

I'm not doing it as a way to escape reality anymore but it's becoming quite addicting  because the burning feeling itself feels good. I tried to quit by snapping an elastic but it doesnt ""hit"" the same. The idea and feeling is as euphoric as a cigarette break to me. I used to constantly be thinking about smoking weed, and when I would get high next and now I don't even THINK or have any desire to get high ever since I started burning my skin. 

It's really starting to worry me because I have a very addictive personality and I don't want to be covered in scars. I like the way cuts and bruises look and feel and I have my whole life been excited when I ""earned"" a bruise, but I don't want people to notice them and start worrying about me and my mental health. I feel like I'm fine, but my actions speak otherwise. 

I don't know what to do :( if it's not this, it's something else I'm addicted to. Cigs, pot, biting holes in my knuckle skin (I know gross), nail biting, plucking hair, alcohol so I know if I stop, theres just a short amount of time before my mind latches onto something else.",11May2019,3

145,"Hey guys, hope you are well.
So I've been wondering about this intense feeling I have sometimes. It's the feeling of not being able to enjoy something due to it not being... Mine? Sometimes it occurs when someone is also enjoying it, which is followed by a strong feeling that I have to give this thing up and cannot take any genuine pleasure from it, because now its theirs and I don't have a right to it (regardless of the fact that I definitely could enjoy it freely, I feel, if not for that weird feeling). Sometimes it happens when the thing I enjoy is being enjoyed in a group, butnot on my terms. Sometimes when it is in a group that I feel marginalised in. In another cases I feel like I have to let it go, the thing that I enjoy, because I don't do it to the degree it should be enjoyed, and my feelings are not genuine and I don't deserve the thing (even though in the back of my head, where I can think logically, I know it's not true).

Is this some kind of documented disorder or maybe just the result of having issues with not being able to feel like I belong? Or perhaps a result of having to be in control of everything in my life? I might add that I have the Adult Children of Alcoholics Trauma/Syndrome. 
I had an incident today when I had this feeling when a movie I really wanted to watch came on with other people in the room and they enjoyed it and I did everything I could not to watch it, which resulted in my boyfriend feeling like I was rude and maybe doing it on purpose and all I could say is that it's because I had this feeling of needing to distance myself. I know it's irrational. I really want to get to the bottom of this. 

Does anyone have any ideas?",11May2019,1
146,"I’m 16, and I’ve only ever cared about animals. I’m that person who says “I love animals more than any human!!1!1!!” but I will genuinely mean it. I don’t care about anyone, not my parents or sibling, nor friends or anyone at school. There are people I could say I like, but by that I’d really mean I don’t find their presence annoying, so I continue being friends with them. But when a friend fucks me over or leaves for whatever reason, I’m not upset, apart from feeling disrespected and angry towards them for treating me like I’m nothing, when I’m generally better off without them and they’re the one losing. Moving on, I fantasise about killing people I know, or even just manipulating and creating problems in their lives out of nowhere. Another factor is that I’ve always been significantly more intelligent than others, wielding a strange sort of common sense and quickly understanding concepts that puzzle others, and people are sometimes surprised at my knowledge on topics, and my “maturity”. Anyway, my point is that I’m still debating whether I’m sociopathic, or anything else. I definitely don’t feel that I’m a completely normal person, whatever that means.",11May2019,0

148,"I’ve been diagnosed with depression, severe anxiety, bipolar disorder since I was 14.

I’m about to turn 26 and have been 4 years clean (yay!) and life has turned completely around the past 4 years. I also suffer from what I believe is chronic fatigue. The problem is I tend to bury everything to the back of my head and am extremely prone to severe stress. Every now and again it all becomes unleashed into this complete breakdown, and it’s usually induced by extreme working hours (6:30-9:30pm, I am a farmer). My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years, living and working next to each other for a year. He can’t understand the drastic issues of my mental health, usually stating he’s “tired too” or “depressed too,” and that I should really “think positively” because when I’m on the verge of these breakdowns they can somehow be completely reversed by thinking positively. I’m exhausted with trying to explain to him how my brain chemistry is very fragile and is very much real. Does anyone have any advice to how I can try and explain to him how serious these things are? He is supposed to support me and he just plays the comparison game, or makes matters worse sometimes by inducing a fight, which in turn makes my mental health nose dive into suicidal thoughts.

152,"I am really struggling the past few weeks. Most of the time I feel like EVERYTHING is wrong.  I sit here writing this and I know it isn't true.  My children are in good health. Still I feel like garbage from the time I wake up until I goto sleep most days.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been spending hours fapping 😞I tell myself that I will get off quick, feel good, then get on with my day.  Unsure if I have an porn problem or a depression problem.  I do it rarely when I am in a good relationship, more when I am single, but not like I have been the past 2 weeks.  IRL I don't want to talk to anyone I know about this.

&amp;#x200B;

Financially I am fu$%@. My Mom  told me she was giving me an early inheritance when her house sold. It felt like her way of saying sorry for all the crap through the years.  I saw this as an opportunity to move my life forward.  I planned to move near the city, finish my education (3.4 gpa so far) , and buy a decent used 4 door car to make some $ while in school by ubering. friends said they make $20 - $30 an hour in this city.

&amp;#x200B;

I made arrangements to move into a shitty basement apartment paying rent under the table, put $1500 down on school, gave away most of my decent furniture because the apt is furnished.  About 2 months after I move my mom realizes there were going to be some taxes involved. She informs me she isn't giving me anything.  WTF?

I had a long conversation explaining to her:

* The taxes are only a chunk of what she was giving me. (maybe 15%?)  Just take them out of it because I need school and the job it will bring so I can afford to live here.
* The $1500 I put down is non refundable
* I need the $ for the car.  Ubering in the city is paying well (own a 2 door car now)
* I can't afford to move someplace else because I have no money
* I made plans based on her promises that I can not undo

I was met with indifference from her.  A year has gone by with almost no progress made.  I am trying so hard to study on my own. There isn't much time working 50 hours a week and trying to spend at least 1 day a week with my kids.  My ex and I had a good co parenting relationship. That is becoming strained because I have no money for summer daycare. This is getting long.

Health wise I am awaiting some tests and also need to save 2 weeks pay for some emergency dental work.  I know I need to get back into counseling, but don't have the time off or the $25 co pay right now. I am angry, depressed, and feel hopeless.  Right now I can not see how this gets any better. I don't have skills to make more and don't make enough to carve out time to study and finish the skill building.

I need $150 in the next two days for rent. Tips are way down at my regular job so I am door dashing tonight. A couple weeks ago I made $110 in 4 hours on a Sat night.  Tonight I have less than 1 delivery per hour. I am missing my time with the kids and still not going to make rent on time after promising the landlord I would.  They own multiple houses and look at my like a complete fuckup because I am poor and struggle to make rent. I probably won't get evicted since I have most of the rent and will finish it off next week.  I just need a break from life the constant bad news lately.

153,"I was dismissed from my first college due to poor academic performance in my freshman year. That was a horrible year, I was on an SSRI that made me hallucinate and my doctors wouldn’t listen to me. Eventually I quit the medicine and found a new practice. They put me on lamictal, it turned me into a zombie but I was able to finish my associates at a local community college and then transfer to a new college.

Well, I just got suspended from this college because my gpa is 1.8. I quit the lamictal last semester because it was causing me so much brain fog. I’ve been happier, more passionate, less anxious, and less depressed and everyone around me has noticed a positive difference. I’m not diagnosed bipolar or anything so it really was just sort of destroying me. 

I just want to get my psych degree, move on to grad school, and work in research. I love my major, I excel in my major classes but I cant function in my gen ed classes. I struggle to  maintain a job while in school and my financial aid office has pulled all my grants and aid because of my low grades. I have no idea what to do. I have a chance to redeem myself with summer classes so I can get off academic suspension, but I’m afraid I won’t be able to work and do school. I rarely had enough money to pay for groceries and bills this semester and usually had to beg people around me for money just to eat. I was trying to work but it was destroying me. I quit 2 of my 3 jobs because I couldn’t take it anymore. I just don’t know what to do anymore.

I've been told to seek help for almost a decade now, and friends with similar problems tell me their medication has helped. Due to financial strains I would prefer if I can find a provider that can prescribe me something instead of having to visit a therapist several times, but I'm not sure if telehealth can do that. Office visits are around $200+ in my area. I'm also without insurance. I have looked into Betterhealth and qualify for their financial aid, but they still want to charge me for a month upfront, and I cannot afford it right now. This is why I would prefer a one-off visit or just a few visits a month. If anyone knows of a place or service that can help me, please tell me. Thank you.",11May2019,1
155,"So I posted this in another section but someone said I might get more help from here. Let me just start out by saying I'm very happy with my relationship with him (29m). I know it sounds defensive, but the two of us are perfect together in every way except in bed. We've been living together for 4 years, and I've enjoyed just about every minute of it.

 I have a very high sex drive, some days it feels like all I think about. But it's not about any person I see, it's always about wanting to do stuff with him. But he has a fairly low drive, to the point that I'm lucky if we do stuff more than once a week if that, and even if we do, neither of us like to bottom so it's kind of like 7 minutes and done. 

The problem that's been bothering me for a while now isn't so much that things are like this, its that I can't control my urges anymore. Before I could take care of things on my own and be fine, but now when I'm sleeping I do stuff that I'm not even consciously aware of. According to him I have a tendency to shove my hand in his pants to touch him. He says I'm easy to push off and I stop. He seems to be fine with it, going as far to say he thinks it's cute I'm so into him, but it scares me. I'm not the kind of person who loses control of what he does, I didn't like smoking pot or drinking because of that, so I never do it. It scares me because if I'm doing it to him, what would happen if we break up and I do it to someone else who isn't understanding? Or what if I go under for an operation and do something?

Lately I've been avoiding contact with him at night, sleeping on the opposite side of the bed, keeping space between us when my arm is around him. But even that doesn't work out half the time because I'll roll over in my sleep. I hate it, it feels like somethings wrong with me and i don't have to money for something like a doctor or psychiatrist. I just want to know if there's some way to stop having sexual urges all the time or better control over what I do in my sleep?",11May2019,1
