0,"Hi, I have dealt with anorexia since I can remember.
I have been doing really good this past year but I gained a lot of weight. I feel like i'm completely out of control and i'm freaking out. I cannot shut the voices in my head telling me not to eat.
Do you guys have any tips on how to control this?

1,"Well, it is quite a long story, but I’ll try to keep it short;

I’m 20 years old and I’ve never had a girlfriend, as I’m never really willing to open up myself to people. I’ve been bullied since my youth and got out of it when I went to high school (the one before university). I’ve never really been able to trust people with my personal life as my trust has been broken quite a bit back then.

So half a year ago I met this girl I only saw in school, but never spoke to her as she was one year lower than me, but I got to know her when I went out and talked to her for about an hour (which I pretty much never do to people I don’t know). I started texting and we got to know each other better, I fell in love with her as she was someone special to me. She opened up about her depression and this made me open up about being bullied and the hard times I went through back then. I really like her and she is the only one I liked to give a hug as I normally don’t want them. We kept talking until we grew apart a bit and she no longer wanted to really have anything to do with me. We could talk in real life, but she was noticeably getting more distant. Until I lasted texted her on why this was, and she doesn’t want to have to do anything with me anymore.

She told me our conversations no longer interested her. This broke my heart as she was the first one that I opened up to. Since then I haven’t really got any confidence left and have been feeling down. I just feel so unimportant, and a bit of a social failure. This really put a weight on me which I know I have to get rid of. I know I shouldn’t keep chasing her, but I just have to, because I want fulfillment. I try not to show people I have this on my mind, but I can see a change in my social ways, whenever she is there I want to talk to her and I just start to mind other people less.

And this just leaves me clueless on what to do.",16Jun2019,3
2,"The last few days have been the worst for me in a long while.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 21, I had been diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 16, but with therapy and treatment I thought I had managed to get out of it.

Through the past year, my anxiety progressively came back (not the depression though), so I went to see a psychiatrist and things got progressively better and once again I thought things were going to be fine. But in the last few days, it seems I have simply gave up.

Now, I just don't see any reason to keep on living. I don't have any goals anymore, even outlandish ones. And that, even though I have a girlfriend and I don't have to worry about my career. Also, I have never harmed myself before, but with each day that passes, I feel the temptation growing. I don't think I like my life nor what I could do with it.

Finally, there is one last thing I'm not sure is relevant, but I'm growing more and more convinced that the world is not what it seems, that there are people that know more than they appear to, that there is a way to escape this world. Don't get me wrong, rationally I'm perfectly able to say that it makes no sense, but I'd be lying if I said that deep down I did not believe it.",16Jun2019,3
3,"My Grandma died after Christmas in 2017. I cared about her a lot and was very close to her and she was kind of the rock of our family...it seems like all the issues I'm having have really gotten worse since then. I feel very numb and when I think of her I cry but can't pinpoint any reason....it's just instant tears when I think about her and then I just try to shake it off.

4,"I have so many people who claim to be supportive of me. I have family and friends and mentors and many many people in my life. Yet I don't (or can't?)  trust any of them. I don't know how. I am almost to the point of paranoia with my distrust :[
To add a little background, I have been emotionally abused for most of my life. Not on purpose...it was just the people I happened to be exposed to during my childhood and adolenscence. I am 25 years old now and finally trying to take responsibility for my healing. And I am getting somewhere...but I feel like for every step I take forward, I take a thousand steps back with every little thing. Like I am SO SENSITIVE now to everything. My heart hurts all the time and so many of these people who claim to love me are the same people who hurt me (either presently or in the past). Some of my friends and family members who have supported me in some ways are the same people who have abused me in other ways. 
I used to numb it with drugs, and that only made things worse. But I got through that and began actual recovery, and this is the time I feel THE MOST DOUBT. Like I'm doing everything ""right"" (taking my meds, self care, spirituality, researching and practicing coping skills, etc) and I still feel like it isn't good enough.
I've gone through so many changes. I have gone back to college and I've actually been doing great, and I feel closer to my true self than ever before...yet it's here that I find myself feeling more alone than ever.

5,"Over the past few weeks, I have began to experience a lot of new mental health issues. 

Disclaimer! I have never spoken to a mental health professional and all the disorders I will be talking about will be a result of self-diagosing. I am not saying I have these disorders, I am simply saying that I have experienced a lot of the symptoms of them. Please don't take me less seriously because of this. 

Background: For as long as I can remember, I have suffered from anxiety or social anxiety. It got worse for a while but has recently gotten better. I was deep into depression and had daily suicidal thoughts for many months during 2017, but during spring 2018, I got extremely obsessive about being bipolar, and for many months, that was all I thought about. I now no longer suffering from severe depression, at worst I have mild depression and I definitely don't think I am bipolar anymore. Summer and fall 2018 were surprisingly good and I did a lot of mental health improvements, although I still have anxiety. However, during all those periods of time, I always had an underlying question of  Borderline Personality Disorder. I have self harmed, I have (had) severe anger issues, ( I'm working on them) and even though I don't want to face it, I do think I have a fear of abondomnet, I tend to be extremely scared of friends leaving me, and whenever I make a new friend, I absolutely love them and I can randomly start ""hating"" people for very minor reasons. For example, I used to be friends with this girl but one day I just decided that she was boring and a pussy and ever since I haven't spoken to her and I've just hated her unreasonably. I also have this thing where I feel like it's better if I ruin a friendship before they realize how weird and insane I am and leave me. I don't actually take any action to do this though, because I'm usually to shy to be rude to people. I should also mention that my entire life, I've never felt like I fit in. Ever since kindergarten, I've felt like an outsider. 

Enough with the backstory and on to my current problems. My biggest mental health issue during spring 2019 was anxiety. But around May this year, I began questioning reality. I spent a lot of lunch breaks alone, just walking around school, feeling insane. I felt as though nothing was real, the entire world was just a simulation. I read a philosophical book and started to believe that my life actually was just a really well written novel and that I was just a character created by someone else. I still don't know what to believe. And recently, it got worse. I made a new friend, and my regular ""am I borderline?"" thoughts began appearing. I started to play a video game and started to believe I was hallucinating. I still don't know what's real. For example, I would hear sounds or see colors from the game and I would feel extremely dissociated from reality and when walking down a street I would feel like I had to hide behind cars and that I was on a mission to kill Nazis. This doesn't happen anymore because I don't play the game that much anymore but it was scary. Over the past days, I've also began to think that I have ADHD. I hate focusing on anything, I struggle to fall asleep because I just can't relax, I can feel so hyperactive that I'll just jump up and down or dance at random times. I don't enjoy life anymore, everything feels boring and there are a million things I want to do and yet nothing. I don't know what to believe. A few days ago, I was suddenly hit with the realization that no matter how hard I try, I will never be a part of society. I just can't make friends. I have known some people for so many years and yet I'm still an outsider when hanging out with them. I want to leave society and do something useful instead. This is a feeling I've felt for a long time, but it has recently grown stronger. 

TL;DR: I feel like nothing is real, I can't focus on anything, I should be enjoying life but I can't and I'm afraid I will never be a part of society. 

And PLEASE don't just write ""go see a mental health professional, we can't help you here"" because I can't do that. And also sorry if there are any mistakes, I'm so tired as I'm writing this.",16Jun2019,1
6,"Hey everyone,

This is my first ever post on Reddit so hopefully this is the right subreddit to post in. Also sorry it's so long and thank you for taking time to read it.

My girlfriend [19] and I [20] have been together since the eighth grade. We've had lots of fun together, we've had some ups and downs, but we're fully committed to each other and love each other a lot.

Right now, she's in college and I'm working full time. We live about an hour away and only really see each other most weekends because that's the only time we can really hangout. Because of this, our relationship is mostly over the phone. Since she's been at school, we haven't been as close as we used to. We always call each other for about 5-10 mins every night to talk and say goodnight and text a little bit during the day. She always asks me to text her more and talk more but I don't check my phone very much and I don't have a lot of energy at the end of the day because my job is very physically and mentally draining. I'm also very introverted and am not a good talker at all, even if I try, so most of our phone calls are mostly her talking. She doesn't really mind it but still wishes I could talk more.

Some things about her personality: She's a super compassionate and caring person. She worries about small things a lot. She sometimes get anxiety attacks. But overall she's always generally happy person.

A few days ago she told me that she's been stressing out for weeks to be able to tell me that she doesn't have feelings for me anymore, which completely broke my heart. She promised, though, that she would try and still make things work between us. 

The next day I went to visit her, and after lots of crying she admitted that she just feels numb and can't really feel anything, which is why she doesn't have feelings for me. She said she started feeling this way a couple months ago but it's gotten really bad in the past few weeks. She also doesn't know the reason why she started feeling this way and still can't figure it out.

Her grandfather had cancer all over his body and has been living with it for about a year. He was bedridden for about a week until he past away a week ago. She wasn't super close with him, but this is her first experience with death. She had been crying about it a lot a few weeks ago but when her mom called and said he had died, she cried for half an hour. When I came to visit her at night she seemed a little sad, but not near as sad as she should've been since she's typically a very sensitive person.

I really haven't been caring for her feelings as much as I should have. In the past couple years she would sometimes call me bawling about things that she was worried about, usually things that I found stupid, but things that weren't stupid to her. I couldn't help her much as I didn't know how to respond, I could never comfort her. I didn't know how to respond to crying over the phone and my reaction would always be annoyance. I always tried to get her to go to someone else for help because I could never do it. I told her that I couldn't handle helping her over the phone.

I know that I'm most likely the reason she feels how she does now. When she was crying over her grandfather she never even called me about it. My guess is that she didn't think I would want to help, since I had always told her to go to her other friends instead. Maybe instead of telling her my feelings she would store them up and keep them away instead, and now her mind tells her to not even have feelings. I'm not sure, I'm not a doctor by any means but she's going through some kind of depression or emotional numbness. She can still feel happy, and she isn't missrable or sad all the time. I'm not sure exactly what she's struggling with.

So to try and help her I've been taking half days off work to come and see her and did some cute things for her to help our relationship like take her to dinner, go on a long walk, and write her a long letter. But she didn't have much to say about these gestures except a little thank you. I've tried to get her to talk about her feelings but all of her answers are ""I don't know"".

I'm a very logical person and love problem solving. My view on this is that every problem has to have a solution, so I have to find the solution to her problem. I've suggested to her going on a trip together, going to see a therapist, changing up her routine, and other things I researched that help numbness/depression. But she didn't want to try any of those things, which made me upset because I was just trying to help.

I'm frustrated because I want there to be a simple solution that fixes everything, but I know that depression takes time to heal. I know I'm a shitty person for not caring about her feelings in the past, but I want to prove that I can support her through this and I want her to trust me with her feelings again.

What can I do to help her?",16Jun2019,1

9,"I've been struggling with impulse control lately. I get in these moods where I just feel restless inside my skin and then I do self-destructive things to release it. It feels like I have too much energy in my body. 

Anyway, lately I've realized I struggle to put words to emotions. I can always describe what I'm feeling like I did above, but never with words like ""anxious"" or ""sad"" or ""angry."" Instead its ""This is making me upset because ___."" Or its ""this is the physical sensation in my body."" My friend pointed it out because he recently kept asking me ""what emotion are you feeling?"" And I couldn't answer because I did not know. 

I'm now trying to identify these emotions. I think this one may be anxiety. I'm not sure. 

I know it sounds like a really absurd problem to have, but can someone let me know what their anxiety feels like? Could it be likely that this is the emotion I'm feeling?",16Jun2019,1

12,"hi, 18 y/o guy here. 

around the middle of last winter, some shit in my personal life got me really down, and i lost a LOT of weight really fast. i went from 185 lbs to around 145 lbs in the span of about 2.5 months, because i wasn't eating as much. i wasn't purposefully starving myself or anything, it's just that nothing really tasted like anything anymore and i didn't really see the point in it. my family noticed the difference in my weight and showed some concern, but i reassured them that i was okay. one of my friends became VERY concerned about me, but again, i assured her that i was alright. in hindsight, i now know that i was probably depressed? but at the time i never would have admitted to it, because i was scared that people would think less of me, or that they thought i was faking it or something. i didn't want to diagnose myself, but i also didn't want to go get an official diagnosis, because i was scared of what they would tell me.

recently i've been doing better, i've started doing the things i enjoy doing again. but it's summer now, and i've realized that i might be showing some symptoms of anorexia. i've started eating less again, but this time i feel like it's more conscious. before i just didn't eat because i thought it was boring, but now that it's summer and i'm going out to the pool and things with my friends, i feel much more self-conscious about how i look. like i said, i'm currently at around 145 lbs, give or take a few pounds, and i know that it would be unhealthy for me to lose more weight, but i can't help but feel like i need to. from the side i look paper thin, you can see my ribs and my pelvis bone, but from the front i feel like i look like a brick wall. i've noticed that i've started counting my calories, i've started making conscious decisions to not eat food that i'm offered, eating makes me feel guilty now. even when i eat small portions of food, i feel the need to go throw up. i've never actually purged, because the thought of throwing up scares me, but i've thought about it/attempted it several times. i weigh myself every day now, and when i gain even half a pound i feel really guilty about it. 

i feel like i might be anorexic or bulimic, but like before, i'm scared of self-diagnosis, and i'm terrified of getting an official diagnosis because i don't want to have my suspicions confirmed. what do you think? should i try to get a diagnosis? if so, how would i do that? what will my friends and family think? what should i do?",16Jun2019,1

14,"I have a friend who has been depressed for years. I've been the steady rock who listens and gives advice when necessary and shows support. But I'm not sure how much I can take.
As someone also dealing with depression, I've had to put distance between myself and her problems. When all your conversations become about her and her problems or her struggle with depression, you start to wonder where you fit in the friendship. It started being very one sided - if I wanted to talk about my problems or how I was feeling, it turned right back around to her, so I stopped talking about most of my problems with her. When I gave advice, she went the other way, so I stopped giving advice. When I wanted to share happy things with me and she was in a ""mood"" (I call it a mood because she can be depressive towards me and completely happy around other people), I just disappeared until she got her shit together.
The distance has been working and some things have mended itself. But she's been so rash. Rather than getting professional help during her crisis, she takes random flights to visit her SO, despite not having the money to pay her bills. She complains to no end about her depression, but doesn't take the necessary steps to get help. I can't keep worrying about her anymore. I don't know if this is getting too toxic for me.",16Jun2019,2

16,"I don't come from a healthy household and grew up valuing my own self worth based on how my parents treat me. Because of this I was obsessively dependent on them making decisions for me, much into my adult life so far.

So, because my dependency on my parent's approval, I chose a major based on what I thought would make them most happy. I put their happiness before my own without realizing it. They were really proud of me and I was set to transfer to a state school from my junior college.

That was a year ago. That summer I faced something of an identity crisis. After a bad breakup, I took up programming to learn game development in my spare time. I saw it just as a hobby. But each summer I'd build more complex games and teach myself more programming. I began to look up to a particular game dev, even.

On one hand, there was a silly little nerdy dream I knew would never come true about working for a big time game studio. On the other hand, I was majoring in something already that was pretty secure and would make my parents proud of me. And I really wanted to make my parents proud of me.

So, I went to school and continued my old major.

I learned to be more and more independent. But as things seemed to be getting better, I soon got cut off of my insurance due to a clerical error. Because of this, I spiralled into a massive episode of depression. I couldnt get out of bed to do so much as eat, let alone go to class.

I remember waking up one day and just thinking ""my major isn't getting me out of bed any more.""

Everything got sorted out, but the damage was already done: I failed all my classes. So, I decided to take one semester to myself, to try out other majors. Not just computer science.

I ended up changing my major to align with my dream. I knew it was silly still. My parents didn't understand and were very concerned, but I kept at it and did amazing. That was just my first semester, though. I still have a long way to go.

As I said in another post on here, I have massive social anxiety. I was able to push that aside and go to E3 (a game expo). I felt so right there, which is silly I guess. It just felt like I was with the right people, people who understood me.

And I met the game dev I look up to. I actually shook his hand and told him i want to work for him. He didn't laugh or push me aside but was really nice about it.

I've come a really far way, and possibly for the first time in my life I'm very proud of myself. I don't really care anymore about how others view or perceive me because I feel satisfied and fulfilled.",16Jun2019,2
17,"So, Reddit is last place that I thought I'd end up at, but here we are.  


Basically, am 19/M/L\[G\]BT  


Over the course of the last three months, I experienced what is called a dissociative episode. This includes feelings of unreality and detachment from the self. This result in scary situations including a process where I began to starve myself. This also includes several identity issues that I am running into. I have reason to believe these are symptoms of an anxiety disorder as it runs in the family and I have experienced heavy anxiety in the past. Yes, I talked to a psychiatrist and that's what we worked out so far.  


While I am in the know of what I'm experiencing, I do not know where anything is stemming from. I'm unsure if it was constant stress, childhood abuse/neglect, parent's divorce, a scary situation (friend did some stupid shit in the passenger seat driving close to the date of the incident), getting drunk for the first time (same night), my coming out being mishandled/ misunderstood by my family, (emotional/physical)abuse from a college friend etc.   


I'm having difficulty identifying with almost all facets of myself, including my memories(even from literally just a few months ago), I get very anxious when I think about it, and I'm always thinking about it, trying to put the pieces together. I can't help but feel robbed. Everything was just fine, even perfect despite the issues I had. I slept off a hangover like it was nothing, survived my dumbass friend, had a new bf, broke up with an old one, managed lots of complicated, yet fulfilling relationships, got good grades, started a new semester, successfully came out(successful meaning I'm not homeless), but I feel nothing now. I can't find the sentiment for the memories. My concentration and sleep are also very bad. I feel like a genuine idiot a lot of the time. For example, I used to be very mindful about media that I consumed, but now I feel like everything is just mindless. It's like I'm socially and cognitively stunted. And sometimes, I have regret for for not doing anything that I could to prevent this. I have trouble identifying with who I see in the mirror and everyone seems like a stranger. I also decided to just stay friends with the guy I was dating since I didn't want him to be disappointed early into the relationship. He's very understanding and we still talk. I've been trying to relax and pull it together with my friends, but it's starting to cause strain. We're edge-lords on the outside, so that's how we interact, but they have hearts of gold, yet I can't shake the feeling that they look down on me now and that I'm worrying them. I also feel like they don't care about me sometimes, but I understand that it's only our established abrasive nature and it's not anything to seriously worry about. I also have been using my family as a financial resource. They have a history of abusing me and they have quirks that give me reason to believe that they're unreliable in particular situations, so I'm watching out for anything that doesn't seem very certain. I don't really know how to feel about anything in general, to be honest. I understand that my mental health is my responsibility, but goddamn I need a hug or something. It wouldn't matter though, since even hugs don't feel authentic anymore. I have to find better jobs and do all ""my"" goals and start being responsible for a lot of other things. I feel like things are slipping. It wasn't always this way. Sometimes, I have suicidal thoughts concerning the situation, but I won't act on them. Been there; done that sort of thing.   


I'm still trying my best to talk to my friends and interact, while taking care of myself. I'm booking appointments with professionals to see what I could make of it. My psychiatrist says I've been very smart about how I've been handling the situation; giving myself time to worry, watching how much I vent about things and to who, limiting the use of search engines, and coming up with all these systems on my own. I've been doing some things on the principle that they are just ""things I don't do"" and breaking a few rules as an emergency measure. I'm going to continue with seeing professionals and hopefully, I could undo all, if not, some of this shit. If not, oh well; maybe new life? Idk.

18,"I am not sure how to describe it, but it happens to me:

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I get thoughts of sad scenarios where something bad happens to me or someone I love because of me, more specifically for a bad decision I've taken in good faith.

&amp;#x200B;

For example,  if I am walking my dog and I see one of those boxes that are used for pest control (with poison inside), I imagine a scenario where I don't know what the boxes are and let my dog inspect it, he finds whatever is inside and I let him eat it, because I assume they're ""treat boxes for doggies"". Then my dog dies.

&amp;#x200B;

Another example, there is a cat food recall, some food had elevated levels of vitamin D and it was killing cats. Suddenly a scenario forms in my head where I decided my kitten would prefer this tasty-looking tuna flavored food instead of her current food, and it's on discount, so I buy it for my cat, she eats it and she dies.

&amp;#x200B;

These kind of scenarios happen all the time, even about relatives or myself, but it's usually about people I love. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have suffered with anxiety since I was 12, so I know what that feels like..but this is different. I have always been the person to show that I was okay on the outside, but eternally I feel lost. I have been able to hide these feelings in my relationship, but today it all hit me at once. I don't believe in taking medications for these things, because I'm more of an herbal healer. Any suggestions would help. Thanks in advance. 💗",16Jun2019,2
20,"Hey guys I’m 20m. So recently I’ve been having some relationship problems with my Gf (18f) and it’s really wearing me down mentally.
So basically I’m a home bound person who doesn’t like to go out much simply because I tend to work a lot and have been dealing with a shit ton family wise. Basically I’m in a situation where my father was deported thus making me the man of the house causing me to work almost a full time job while going to college full time as well. I have a girlfriend and she just graduated high school. Lately she’s been getting upset with me because she says our relationship has changed from the beginning. She says I’ve been getting really grumpy lately and honestly it’s because every time I spend time with her I feel smothered and feel like she does nothing but complain to me. I genuinely love and appreciate her but it feels like I’m the bad guy. Am I in the wrong for not wanting to do stuff sometimes? like there are days where I have a full day off from work and I don’t feel like going out or doing anything, and she gets really upset and goes off on a tangent on how I always make excuses and stuff like that. I constantly tell her there are times when I really don’t feel like doing anything and I feel like she should at least respect my decisions. Other than days like those, I always give her whatever she asks for. There are days where I let her decide on whatever we do for that day. But when I want personal days or lazy days she spends the day complaining about how I never want to do anything. Idk I tried talking with her about it but she makes herself the victim all the time. 
It makes me feel like a lazy piece of shit. 
(Also She just started her cycle so I’m very careful right now in not making relationship altering decisions due to her already being in enough pain. I really love her and I want to be able to explain this to her in a way she’ll understand)
Any advice?",16Jun2019,1
21,"My best friend has dealt with a  lot of abuse growing up. He always resorts to drugs to cope with these things instead of talking to me or dealing with them in other ways. Whenever he's drunk he'll treat me like garbage. Instead of saving up more money to get out of his situation he just uses it to illegally buy drugs online. He has heart problems and I worry all the things he take is gonna fuck him up. I'm fine with him drinking every now and then or smoking weed but this is just too much. He always uses it as a scapegoat. I have begged and pleaded for him to stop but he always breaks his promises even though he knows it hurts. Whenever I tell him to stop now and days he just gets angry at me and acts like I'm the enemy.

But now, for the past few days I have started to have some uncontrollable twitching... It started with just my head kinda looking left really fast, then my arms/hands gripping onto things and not letting go, to last night, where my whole body was having a spasm, almost as if I was being possessed by a demon.  Now today, in the last few hours I've been having full-on conversations with myself but it feels like I'm talking to someone else.  It feels like someone else is controlling my body.

That’s stuff people do when they’re fucked up in the head. I get that. However, I can’t help but feel like I’m doing it on purpose because I somehow am “impersonating,” or “want to be sick.” I’m afraid of my loved ones finding out (they’ve got enough stuff to worry about without me dragging them down), and am angry that I can’t just snap out of it. I can’t convince myself that self-harm is unhealthy regardless of whether or not it involves a knife, and I still tell myself that it’s normal to let your family be the only reason you don’t cut your arms open every night.

27,"I've been struggling with major depression and anxiety since adolescence and have been keeping up with medication and therapy treatments along with meditation and exercise. However, I still feel that nagging urge to take my own life every single day, usually constantly throughout the day. I can typically find refuge in romantic relationships and close friendships, but with two recent breakups (one very recent) and the lack of friends in my area due to college graduation and all of the standard early 20s bullshit I feel a total lack of support due to these relationships breaking down and naturally dissipating. 

When I'm particularly suicidal I usually am unable to focus on my hobbies like writing music or reading, and on my worst days the constant crying and despondency can make leaving the house to exercise extremely embarrassing. I call my mom or my sister every now and then, but if I call them every time I'm suicidal I'll never leave them alone and I'll leave them worrying more than they already do, which isn't fair to them. My therapist is also a great resource, but I only spend a small fraction of my week with her and I'm uncomfortable calling her outside of our time together. 

Currently my plan involves listening to calming music while practicing mindfulness and diaphragmatic breathing. Usually I'll try to think of things I like about myself as per an ex-girlfriend's advice, but I don't particularly like myself at all and oftentimes it can worsen my mindset quite dramatically.

31,"I've posted this on both r/advice and r/mental health. Dont know where else to post this. 

So, I've been struggling with Anxiety (especially Social) for 2 years and what I perceive to be Depression (due to a little self harm, but that's another story). 

But onto the Social Anxiety. I've always felt hypersensitive in Social situations, as well as been awkward or bad in them. This is especially true when it comes to Social Events. It's not so bad, because I have friends. The problem is, I never how to interact socially ""well"". Sometimes, I make really bad jokes or act annoying and feel really bad about it afterwards. Like really bad, where I dont feel like interacting again, want to leave immediately, go over it a thousand times in my head (what's that called?). 
 
And even with the friends I have, I don't have the best relationships. I recently finished my Sophomore Year of High School. I made a completely new friend group in Freshman Year (like everyone else). However, we never really hang out unless it's at School or Academic Competitions. This is a bit of a rant at this point, but oh well. I honestly didnt even interact with anyone through texting until this year. And I haven't hung out with anyone outside of School since I was 7. 

While the closest of my friends know about my Depression and maybe a little about my Social Anxiety, they have no idea how bad it gets. And while this bothers me so FUCKING much, I haven't been incentivized to do anything about it until now because of my approaching Sweet Sixteen. I want to break the cycle, lest it destroy me for my life. 

I should probably give you context. I won't be in town during my Birthday, because I am leaving for a 5 week research program a week beforehand (I'm actually somewhat academically talented, somehow). And while my parents are having a celebration beforehand, it's mostly family and it's in 11 hours (so a little late to invite anyone). Plus, currently 80% of my friend group is in Dallas for NSDA nationals (debate nerds). 

So my question is, how do I do it? How do organize a small celebration with friends after my program? How do I inform them of Social Anxiety without feeling like a burden? And how do I break the cycle? 

I need help, guys, and I don't know what else to do.",16Jun2019,2

For a long time now, I feel like everything is ultimately boring. Nothing can really satisfy me. And its not that I dont have purpose, I finally got back on college and do ocassional work from time to time, but I am so unsatisfied with everything. With people, with places, with things. Things I used to enjoy like going to coffee and talking with my friends gave me so much satisfaction. Now, I dont get any satisfaction from it, I dont know what to talk about, there is nothing to talk about.

I remember when I was a kid, I had so much enthusiasm for things, for games, for travel, for friends, for everything.

34,"Hi everyone,  


I am a person living with bipolar 1, OCD, GAD, and in recovery from alcoholism.  


I have put together very strong recovery and boast a solid year of volunteer work and paid experience in mental health and public service. I want to continue giving back. I do Oregon peer support training in a week. I'm very excited, but concerned about my driving record. Most peer support jobs require driving.  


I have a DUI from 2014 (almost 5 years old but not quite) and an at fault accident. No tickets. I live in Washington, and my state allowed me to reinstate my license while suspended in Oregon. I thought I was good, only to learn I was still suspended when trying to renew my license 2 months ago. Got it all cleared up and reinstated. Learned from that. Research the law and don't assume. The accident was due to my bad driving in the snow. I was going 20mph and when I braked for a red light, my tires locked and I slid 60 feet into the car in front of me. I've definitely learned from it. Next time it's 5-10mph in the snow and braking extra early just in case. The DUI was drunken stupidity, plain and simple. No explanation for that one other than poor choices. Learned from that as well. I don't have any tickets in the last 3 years. My last ticket was 2013. I am a very safe driver.

He is a vile man who abuses everyone in the household in order to establish a sort of dominance by fear. She needs help as soon as possible and we don't know what to do. Getting her taken away by CPS would demolish her future, as the opportunities she has been given were possible due only to the fact that her dad is who he is and she is where she is.

We finally talked about it tonight and when I agreed she didn't take it well. I told her I want to make this as painless as possible and work something out so it disrupts her life as little as possible (it's my families house we live in and we share a car) but she doesn't want to hear it. She suffers from severe depression and says she doesn't want to start over again and is giving up. The things she is saying have me genuinely worried for her. She says she's quiting her job and is giving up on life. I don't know if she's just saying that because this is all fresh or if there is something to be worried about. Calling the hospital could derail her life significantly if she's not serious, but if she is and I don't act I could never live with myself. She does need help tho. She assumes it's impossible for her to ever be happy again. It's breaking my heart and I'm worried for her but I have to stand by this decision. I want us to work on and become happy with ourselves because i feel we could then easily fix the problems in our relationship down the road but she doesn't see that as an option.

40,"So, I've actually gotten over most of my social anxiety, I actually find myself being more able to go up to strangers and things than a lot of my non-social anxiety friends. That being said, I have no social skills. Throughout my entire life I've had 4 conversations that I can remember that have lasted more than 15 minutes. I just never learned how to talk to people. My only friend from 1st-8th grade was autistic and in therapy I learned that I mimic a lot of his traits so a lot of the little I did learn apparently wasn't right. I used to want to have a gf, lots of friends, stuff like that, now that I'm not too nervous I don't really have much interest in that. For me, I don't see learning social skills as something even remotely possible for me, not to the point I see others doing it. I'm in a few group chats and stuff and I frequently have to read back multiple messages multiple times to understand what people are saying, and coming up with a response is extremely difficult. People usually describe me as seeming out of it since I talk and make jokes but I don't really seem to fit into the conversation or include anyone else. Right now my life mainly consists of playing video games 6-12 hours a day alone and occasionally doing something with a friend, I force myself to do it because I don't want to lose the little bit of social skills I've gained. Honestly though, I'm fine with this, my depression has significantly decreased since I've started being by myself more (my depression peaked when I had a friend group of 7-8 people and a gf, even though they were all good people and not toxic at all) just because I feel like I don't fit in, and I don't. Occasionally I think of something good to say, and it feels really good to type out a message that just fits with the conversation, but those are rare. Has anyone else experienced this?

However my sister was speaking to everybody. When we we're seated nobody spoke to me even if I tried, the conversations lasted for short periods. Sorta like a hi and bye. Nobody asked for my name

Eventually I felt like maybe I smelt bad or there was something about my appearance that put people off but that wasn't it as I went to the bathroom to freshen up. When I got back the people that had been sitting across my sister and her boyfriend, who had spoken to me in the hi and bye situation, were leaving and started greeting my sister. But they walked around the table and straight past me to her and said goodbye and left. So naturally I felt terrible about that and didn't know what to do so I just went back to the car.

This is always accompanied with tunnel vision and then me forgetting all that I thought (or at least not having the words to describe it) almost immediately afterwards.

Im trans. Ive come to terms with this id never in my life be loud and proud about it. I actually never plan on coming out when im older. I actually plan on acting like im just a normal guy doing their everyday thing once I transition. I don’t believe in love so I won’t have a reason to tell someone else anything. I wish I didn’t feel this way and I’ve tried so hard to ignore it.  I have healthy habits but im slowly starting to hate them. (By healthy habits I mean working out, drawing, cooking things like that.) I just I don’t understand myself. How is this happening to me? Why now? Why can’t I just be normal? I think but then I found something that fucked my mind over even more. I want to be a professor and teach like psychology possibly or just psychology in general is what I would like to do. While researching I found BPD.

Bpd or borderline personality disorder is a cluster b personality disorder that is often characterized by an immense fear of abandonment. Self-diagnosis is not okay and im not going around telling people this is what I have but I fear I do. 

1. Emotionally unstable) I can be completely calm and stable only to randomly get mad at something small

2. Inappropriate anger) I got mad at my toaster not working so I blew it up

3.chronic feelings of emptiness) I always feel empty

4. Self-damaging acts) I can’t really even drive yet but I got in a car and I was drunk. I also go to parties and do whatever drug I see in sight. 

5. Suicidal behavior) I sadly used to burn myself. I stopped cause I got sick of the scars doesn’t mean I dont miss it like hell though. 

6. Unstable self-image) one reason I don’t want this disorder. If I have bpd me being ‘trans’ just fits into this. Oh and I switch from saying that im straight to gay to bi to pan. So that also fits in here

7. Dissociative episode) Sometimes I start to feel like nothing around me is real and all thatcmatters is punching until my hand starts bleeding thats why I’ve gotten into so many fights even if I lose it feels so good to punch.

8. Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment) I had a best friend and whatever she did I would follow. I slowly started to fall in love with her. I wanted all of her attention so ignored her to see if she would try to contact me back. Surprise surprise she didn’t. What I did to get back in her life well thats another story. Then she started to like this other person. I hurt that person told them to leave. In the end her and I dated for a little bit but I dont feel love so once I got sick of her I tossed her out. I was 12 at the time, she was 16

I don’t experience intense and unstable relationships with people so I only have 8 symptoms but you only need 5 to begin with.

Bpd is more of a female mental illness. It has correlations with estrogen so it makes sense. I just don’t want what comes with that. I don’t give a shit what happens to me in life. Life is shitty no matter what but adding bpd to that pile of shit.

Im not hating on BPD. If you have bpd you are not your illness you are more than that you are stronger than that.",16Jun2019,2

48,"Hello. I am a 29-year-old American female graduate student living and studying on campus in Canada. 

While I have been prominently anxious all my life, my last therapist indicated that it's possible that I have also been depressed all my life, but that it wasn't as prominent or noticeable until I reached young adulthood. Having been in and out of therapy, and on and off medications since I was 13, I can say that I am mostly aware of what is causing my continued anxiety and depression, but have no idea how to move forward to overcome them. 

My most recent diagnoses were around 2016, for Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I am currently on medications but am not seeing a therapist. Despite treatments I've tried in the past (see below), and the fact that I do think that in some ways I'm better off than I was, I'm still really really struggling a lot: 

**Treatments I've Tried In the Past**

\- # of Therapists: 7

\- # of Psychiatrists: 5

\- Medications: Abilify, Buproprion (Wellbutrin), Buspirone, Citalopram, Prozac, Xanax (on an as needed basis), Zoloft 

\- Other: Countering negative thoughts with positive thoughts, establishing a daily routine, exercise, GeneSight testing (fairly new but divisive on how valid the results are; it tests your DNA to see which medications would work best for you and I'm currently on them), journaling, making a list of just one or two things to do a day and doing them and being okay with that, meditation, mood tracking apps, positive self-talk, setting more reasonable and smaller goals, talking to loved ones, vitamin D, writing down ""good things that happen"", yoga

**Issues with Treatments I've Tried in the Past:** Apathy, perfectionism, and lack of motivation have made it hard to do/stick with any sort of activities/assignments/exercises/strategies outside of a therapy session though I have tried to time and again, I have a logical understanding that much of my thinking is irrational and is due to a variety of external factors but I've still been unable to apply this knowledge, and whenever I try medications they work for awhile but then stop working. 

**While I am experiencing a long list of symptoms, these are the ones I find to be most distressing:** Apathy, binge eating, fear of social situations, frequent spending (on binge food), lack of basic hygiene, lack of interest, lack of motivation, lack of self-esteem (intense), trouble getting out of bed, trouble getting to sleep, and sleeping too much

**Medications I Currently Take Daily:** 450mg Buproprion (aka Wellbutrin), 30mg Busprione, 20mg Citalopram 

I want to see the school counselor, or get referred to a psychologist and/or psychiatrist in the area, but I'm afraid I'll have the same issues with treatments I've tried in the past, and have anxiety about travelling off campus to see a psychologist or psychiatrist. I also want to try some of the group therapy sessions at school, but I'm afraid of the social interaction or them not working. 

Sorry for the long post, ***TL;DR****: I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for 16 years despite numerous attempts at medical and therapy-based interventions, and while I know why I feel as badly as I do, I don't know what to do to fix it; I used to know someone who ran out of answers and I don't want to run out of answers.*

I’ve tried talking to my siblings and they’re replies are “no. I’ve got depression” or “I’ve got anxiety” and make me feel like I’m not important. I went through some stuff with my birth mother when I was younger, and I basically had to raise my 3 younger brothers from 9 to 11 years old. Since moving back to my dads, I’ve tried to talk to them about what happened but they always think I’m exaggerating about what it was like. I’ve tried telling them how I feel but there’s always something more important going on. They always joke about me being dumb and call me sensitive when I get upset. They told me not to pursue my dream of becoming a psychologist because I’m not smart enough. My older brother hates me and always has for whatever reason. My grandparents wish I wasn’t born. My dad thinks I’m a waste of space. And I’m not sure I can go on for much longer. It’s just really hard to keep going.",16Jun2019,1

53,I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve stopped taking my meds since they don’t affect me at all. I have to wait several months before I can go to a psychiatrist to get diagnosed. Meanwhile I’m constantly on the verge of panic attacks. I’m in a constant state of what’s probably depersonalization. Sometimes I wish that I’d just go to sleep and never wake up. I can’t figure out what to do now. I feel extremely sad since my cat died. I can’t think about her without having a breakdown. My other cats help but sometimes they remind me so much of her that I can’t be near them. Oh god. I can’t figure anything out.,16Jun2019,1
54,"Hey guys. I don’t usually publicly post about what’s going on mentally for me because it feels like I’m complaining when I do...but I figured Reddit was probably the best place to do so. 

So, I’ve been fighting with depression, anxiety and borderline personality disorder for many, many years now. I am currently unmedicated due to a recently lack of affordable health insurance as well. And, as you can probably imagine, the combination of mental illness left untreated is a fucking nightmare. 

I’ve gone through a lot...like a lot of bullshit in the past ten or so years of my life and I’ve just recently started getting my life back on track. 

I am a dry alcoholic. I’ve been sober for about a year and three months. I currently live at home with my father and step-mom. My step-mom is a RAGING alcoholic. And a mean one at that. When she gets drunk, all hell breaks loose in the household. She gets loud, angry, and sometimes even physically violent. I spend the majority of the time at my boyfriend’s house and usually come home on the weekends to spend time with my cats and my dad. But that still doesn’t save me from her drunken outbursts. 

This doesn’t help ANYTHING. Her behavior triggers my anxiety. Which in turn triggers my alcoholism. I want to drink. BADLY. But, I don’t. My sobriety is important to me and I always remind myself how silly it would be to throw away all of my hard work and progress because of one person who literally has no control over any aspect of my life. 

Today I came home and my room was destroyed. My bookcase was torn apart, my clothes were all over the floor, and my cats were scared shitless. My stepmom had done this in a drunken stupor because she was upset that I was going to spend time with my cousin today (her estranged sister’s son). I grabbed my cats and locked myself in my room for the night. 

Now, I know this will all dissipate in the morning and she probably won’t even remember what she did. But still, it’s a huge invasion of my privacy and serious destruction to my belongings. 

I should also explain that not only do I get treated like absolute shit at home. But I get treated like shit at my job as well. My boss is a narcissist. You cannot question her authority without punishment, Even if there is sound logic behind your argument.

Last night I stay TWO hours past my scheduled clock out time to help the other girls close the restaurant. And I ended up receiving a pretty nasty text message on my way home claiming that I didn’t do enough. And I repeat, I stay TWO HOURS later than I should have because I was helping other people do things that I wasn’t even obligated to help with. And then this morning I was told that I was no longer working next Saturday. When I asked why I was told word-for-word, “When things don’t get done, I’m taking shifts away. Do your job.” I wanted more than anything in the world to tell this woman to go fuck herself. 

I want to fucking cry right now. I don’t want to go in for my shift tomorrow morning. I don’t want to be anywhere near my family. Battling my mental illnesses is hard enough on its own...it’s even harder when you feel like everyone is working against you as well. 

Sorry. I just needed to vent. 

Tl;dr: I’ve reached a breaking point. I’m maintaining my sobriety but seriously struggling.",16Jun2019,2
55,"suicidal girlfriend and unsure how to deal with it 

Last night I attended a house party with my girlfriend. An hour or so into the party she was complaining of terrible stomach cramps (she was on her period). She had initially taken a paracetamol tablet unaware of the dangers that come with mixing paracetamol and alcohol. It was soon after her friend called me over telling me she is throwing up. At first I assumed it was due to her drinking too much, however she claimed it was her period pains. 30 or so minutes later she began vomiting again everywhere, this is when I decided i have to take her home. As we were put the front waiting for the taxi she started crying and saying how she should just kill herself and how she wants to kill herself, claiming it would benefit everyone. After about 30mins I managed to calm her. She had never opened up to me about being suicidal along with why she was, I only knew about her anxiety so this was all very new to me and confronting. As we arrived at her place she refused to go in falling to the ground repeatedly saying I can’t do this anymore I can’t I want to and need to kill myself. I’m a very non emotional person who can be considered as “cold”. As you can tell I was unsure how to respond to these comments and shocked at what she was telling me. I’m unsure if I can continue this relationship. Not because I don’t care about her or cant be bothered. I just don’t think I’m capable of supporting her and am scared that I’ll loose her or our relationship will no longer be enjoyable. (Sorry for this long ass post:)",16Jun2019,3
56,"I've been around for quite a few years and in that time have, at times, felt very low. And in those periods thought that I couldn't go on. Looking back the one thing that stands out for me is the realisation that the hopelessness didn't last; it passed. I'm glad to be able to write this now, not in any triumphalist way, not wanting to patronise anybody or kid myself that those feelings may not return, but just to let you know they pass. And in between those times when all seemed black there were long periods of relative contentment and even the ability to laugh once in a while.  I could find the beauty and pleasure in simple things like music and friendship. 
My recommendation to you, if you feel this way is, keep going and it will pass. That feeling of hopelessness will change to something else, given enough time and distractions. It is after all a feeling and feelings change. And the thought that you can't see any other way is just a thought. Thoughts change also, given time and distraction, into different thoughts. Tell yourself 'this feeling of hopelessness will pass' . Given time it will change.

58,"I've gone through 6 degrees of mess this year. I don't know whether telling myself it's not a big deal and to chill is better or worse. Pretext: I've had an anxiety disorder most of my life, and thought I had it fairly under control by only having 2 bad panic attacks per year.

I feel like I generally have a poor sense of self, and I use objects to help ground me and remember what I like. My room got very messy being filled with things, and I held onto a lot of things most people would let go of. (Movie tickets, Disney world ticket, pamphlets I got in my first week at my job 3 years prior.) Things that made me feel really good and proud of myself, because they reminded me of who I am, but it was a lot of things, and I started to think that was bad and weird, and I didn't have a whole lot of room in my room to keep a box for every year of memories. (Though maybe I should) So when I got into college I purged a lot.
Today I don't have anything to ground me anymore it feels like.

Between identify crisis of getting into my late 20s and how I want to live my life and grow up into an ""adult"", to school decisions attending college for a Bachelor's degree for the first time in my life, entering super-senior status, at a school that doesn't suit my personally, and a major that isn't me but a smarter job decision, and growing apart from all my old friends, and struggling immensely to make friends on campus when 90% of my school is under 22. If I act like an irresponsible 22 year old to make friends, who am I then? I still don't get their jokes and I don't want to. I'm having an identity crisis, and my old friends can't help me. As the prospect of a better economic status seems likely, I feel really detached from them. I've been trying to cookie cutter myself into this mold for this exact job that I've learned to do in school, and I think there are decent chances I get the job, and I either burn myself out trying to pretend to be the person they want, or I be myself, and myself doesn't care about this subject so I don't know what happens then. What DOES happen then? When I put all my eggs in this basket so that I can finally make enough money to not be in a content state of fearing homelessness.
There's no way to know if I'll like it until I'm doing it. But while I'm in school I keep trying to do EVERYTHING to have my bases covered and basically I'm becoming a master of none in skills I don't want to do for the rest of my life.

I don't know what this is, just tell me I'm not crazy or something and give me advice to get through the Summer completely alone with my roommates gone and just my thoughts for 2 weeks before summer classes start.",16Jun2019,1
59,"I recently lost a very close friend, they didn’t die, but they decided to cut me out of their life for another friend, so it kinda feels like they did? Ever since then I’ve been in a different place mentally. If I think about her I break down, if I see her and her friends on social media I feel this overwhelming sadness, it’s absolutely horrible. It’s like no matter what I do I always wanna check her story, and I regret it and cry. Ever since then I’ve become terrified of loosing people I love. It’s gotten so bad that every night I go to bed crying because I think of my family and them dying. I’ll start sobbing if the thought of my family dying crosses my mind. I have no idea how to deal with this. I don’t understand why this is even happening, I’ve come to terms with the fact me and my ex-friend are different people and can’t be friends anymore. Does anyone have any sort of advice? Literally anything would be appreciated.",16Jun2019,3
60,"I’m going through a lot at this point in my life. I care way to much about what others think of me and it’s causing me to experience depression. I haven’t been able to sleep throughout the night peacefully in a long time due to anxiety and now recently a deep sadness. I don’t know if anyone else feels like this but if you do as I lay in bed wide awake in the middle of the night I read this in an article. It gave me food for thought...
“Our minds are wired for negativity—an evolutionary tool designed to keep us safe. But today, this process doesn’t serve us. We’re not meeting bears that might kill us at the event tonight, but our bodies are responding as if we were.” I feel like I spend my time lately worrying about being liked by others. If they think bad things or say bad things about me behind my back it causes a mix of terrible emotions and brings me back to a very depressive state. Does anyone else feel this way? Is anyone else feeling a strong need of acceptance and approval or am I just going crazy?",16Jun2019,1
61,"I understand not what my troubles are, fore all I know is that they exist. In the past I was once average, so I know now that my experiences are problematic. I'm still able to evaluate my behaviors, and occurances to draw conclusions from them. To what degree, and for how long eludes me for the foreseeable future. Regardless, I juggle my questionable sanity daily. Certain aspects of my mind challenge me in the worst ways daily, disassociation, anxiety, hallucinations, and the occasional bouts of paranoia. Truthfully speaking I don't understand the extents of it, my mental condition is equitable to my comprehension of my past - which is to say; what do I know is actually a fallacy? What is falsely understood and misleading me? What am I unable to comprehend despite its factual basis? I dont even trust myself to understand just how out of touch I am these days.

My present is at best described as bleak, it seems my best hope is medication; perhaps it will lead me to a lifestyle where I can prosper? It seems unfair, that I should be blessed with a mind that holds intelligence but is hindered by insanity. I question what my future holds, is it a steady downward slope of turmoil? Will my symptoms continue to worsen to the point where I am continuously antagonized? Will I begin to hallucinate entire entities and the voices will become intelligible? Will I lose my mind entirely? Will I ever ascertain my peak potential or am I destined to be limited by my blight, only to hold it at bay with reoccurring relapses in continuous mental gymnastics? The feelings I am having, the feelings I'm anticipating I will have, truthfully what bothers me the most is that it's a future I cant begin to fathom a hypothesis at; it's entirely out of my ability to know or control. That's the scary part, I could lose my mind and I have no control over it. Coping mechanisms may better it, but at the end of the day at best itll be a perpetual battle with my afflictions where if I even misstep the consequences could be dire and permanent. I used to dream of having a daughter, but now I question if continuing my lineage is for the best. Would I wish this torment on my own creation, my own flesh and blood? Its bothersome - all the consequences of this circumstance.

Lost i am truly, I've begun not to trust myself. I've yet to consider myself a danger to myself or others; but still I don't trust myself. I don't know what I'm capable of especially in consideration of my problems of intrusive thoughts. I've no intentions, ideation, or plan of suicide but with everyone whispering about it and going to the er I wonder - will there come a day where they begin? And if I see that day will I have the clarity of thought to stop them, or the bravery to seek help? Sometimes I get urges to do horrible things, like squeeze my cat when I'm petting her. I'd NEVER hurt her, I've battled these kinds of thoughts since 5. My first thought was to rip the head off my stuffed animal I got on my first birthday and toss my toys out the car window. I still have the stuffed animal in near mint condition in hopes of giving it to my hypothetical offspring on their first birthday, consider it a success story transpiring over a little under two decades. Sometimes these thoughts tell me to jump into traffic, or harm others but I'm battling them well.  Could there come a day where I'm no longer able to such as these days where I've lost so much of my cognitive abilities? Again I cede to the point - I no longer trust myself. I dispise admitting these things but I must.

I cant help but contemplate on what atrosities my mind could conjure up. Ragged humanoids with flailing limbs teleporting to me in a distorted fog? I've yet to see anything close to this caliber, but I feel it calling to me. I feel as though I'm marching down an inevitable pathway towards these kinds of misfortunes. The more I fixate on them the closer to them I feel. In the same way where the more I acknowledge my hallucinations the more tangible and frequent they become. My only hopes of escaping this reality is to acknowledge these anomalies so that I may face them, conquer them. However in doing so I'm giving them more power. Since we started talking about schizophrenia and I've asked my family about my father it feels more real to me. Several family members said my father was probably schizophrenic, without me leading the conversation or informing them of my situation to keep it pure. All I did was ask for anecdotes of his behavior of which I will read to you next, and their take on his mental health. Regardless it feels concrete to me now, like its enveloping me. In this same sense the more I face my demons the more they tighten their grasp on me. I hope the anti psychotics truly make the difference, for if not I am surely doomed.",16Jun2019,2

I've been dealing with a lot of internal crap lately, and I've been trying to figure it out so I know what I need to do to help rectify it. I just would like some thoughts on this to kind of help me go in the right direction. Forgive me if this is kind of all over the place. So for the past few years, I've been feeling more and more incapacitated when it comes to doing... Anything, really. It's like my motivation tank is empty. Even when it comes to doing things I love, it's like I just can't muster up the desire or motivation to do them. Or when I do, I can only focus on it for a little while and my thoughts will start to distract me or pull me into another direction, causing me to not get much done. When it comes to talking to people, I tend to interrupt others in conversation (not to be a dick) just so I can get out my thought to contribute before either the topic becomes irrelevant or o forget it. If I forget it, it'll drive me nuts and by the time I remember it, it's irrelevant, which further irritates me. When I'm talking, I'll often stumble over my words as if my mind is moving faster than my mouth. People often tell me that I talk too fast. I'm also overly concerned about what people think of me, and I'm kind of paranoid that people are sparing me their honest opinions for the sake of being polite. Of course whether or not these are true or a product of my mess of a mind is to be determined. I used to not be like this. And it's become really distressing that I just don't feel like doing anything anymore. I hate this, and I believe it's coupling with depression since I start to feel like I'm not doing anything with my life and get really just... Down into a pit of anxiety and shittiness that I struggle to crawl out of. It seems like this happens at least once a month for a few days. The only time that I feel more true to myself, more natural, feeling like I should, is when I'm intoxicated. But I don't want to rely on alcohol to make me feel like a normal human being. I've wanted to go to the doctor about it and try to get some help to make me not feel this way. But I'm always concerned that the doctor will brush it off like it's nothing, or make it out like I'm some junkie looking for meds or something. Everything else I've tried just seems like a very short term solution to a long term problem. I don't know. There's so much stuff I want to do, but this... Thing is holding me back.

63,"Okay so I was on an antidepressant (alongside lamotrigine) for my BPD since June 2017. I started DBT in February 2018 and those things combined have helped so much. Now the sexual side effects got worse and worse with my old medication (escitalopram) and it just made me feel worse than usual (hormones + long distance relationship = I want to fucking enjoy it while I can). Along with that I was in another depression spell I couldn't get out of. In November 2018 I changed to Valdoxan which is weaker but improved my sleep (best thing ever omg) anyways that's been great, except now the weakness has shown with a depression spell that's lasted since around March. Just under 3 weeks ago I had an appointment, brought the depression and frequent panic attacks up again saying that it hasn't improved since my previous visit 2 months prior, just been worsening. I got put on a small dose of Effexor XR alongside the rest of my stuff. I feel even worse now. I'm constantly low and empty, on edge, agitated and just plain done with everything. I even started harming again after about 7 or 8 months. DBT is only just helping me keep my relationships with people stable but other than that, it feels like everything is falling apart.

I don't want to go through all the details, but long story short, my brother has outbursts where he gets very violent. He's been like that all of his life. It just seems like he has the mood when he gets up in the morning. He's attacked me countless times.

Even after moving back in with my mom (parents separated), I still have the occasional nightmare of getting attacked by him, especially when he comes to visit. It leaves me very panicked, usually screaming myself awake. He's also tried to kill me in my sleep a few times so it's hard to sleep a few days after having one. 

My parents are protective of him, getting mad at me if I ever told anyone or wanted to go to the police. I secretly kept some evidence, but most of it is pretty old.

I'm in the process of, after almost 8 years, finally getting help and diagnoses beyond just anxiety and depression after giving up for a long time. The thing is, my mother in particular is really quite religious and genuinely thinks my problems are a result of things like, me watching horror movies with friends a as a teen, listening to rock/metal, reading YA novels about people with ""powers"" when I was in high school, and watching harry potter once, and that these things have caused me to be possessed by demons, and/or have spirits take over my soul or something. It hurts a lot when she says these things as to me, she's basically implying that it's my fault and if I was a better person I wouldn't have these problems, when I know she's just in denial about it being hereditary and a product of emotional abuse and instability as a child (which she probably feels guilty about). I was raised Christian but as an adult am not really sure what I believe anymore, I wouldn't call myself Christian though but no one knows that. This conversation has come about again recently as I'm finally seeing a psychiatrist this week to get clarification on my diagnoses. 

I'm just having a lot of trouble shaking the things she says, and she doesn't know (or refuses to see) the severity of my illness. She says all mental illness is spiritually based and comes from having something wrong with your spirit, and that's the only way you can develop a mental illness. She's generally supportive of me but she's very unpredictable, sometimes she's really understanding and other times she's incredibly degrading and mean to me about my mental health.

 One day after my session with the counselor, I was walking out through the waiting area when a woman waiting for her appointment loudly called out my name in recognition . 
 
 She was someone I knew as a customer from my place of employment. 

 This was witnessed by my therapist and the receptionist. 
 
 To say that I was visibly shaken was an understatement.

                           MY LETTER

 All last week I have been unnerverd and upset by what happened.

 This is supossed to be a place of safety,
a place where a person needs to feel protected.

 Well I didn't feel to safe or protected the other day.

 I need to know that I am placing my trust in a person who will respect that trust and do all that they can to foster that trust between us.

 If I can't feel that trust then I don't belong here !!

 This girl, if I remember correctly knew me from a job I had prior.

 I know you are a carring person and not to cut you down, but don't you think it might be wise when you have a client who was clearly in distress to follow up in a day or so after witnessing the occurrence , 

 Letting them know that you care and that you had addressed this issue with the other person?

 I know one can't control what another person says or does

 But her calling out my name in the waiting room is ill-mannored, inconsiderate and disrespetful of the process.

 As I said the other day; I am accutly aware that every time I walk up to this building I am already extremly self consious of who is going to see me enter and wonder why I am going into this place.

 What I (and others) are going through is bad enough, but to have to worry about what some knuckelhead says or does in here is pushing ones limits.

 So that being said I wonder if I am in the right place.

And working with the right person.",16Jun2019,1

She got into a depressive swing last week, and called me wanting to hurt herself. She wanted to relapse (she’s been sober in AA for 30+years). I convinced her to go to a therapist, and hopefully she will. 

I don’t know what to do. I need to talk to her. I already talked to my dad, and he agrees that he sees signs for a while now. 

She has always had mild swings throughout my life that I noticed. She had postpartum depression, and that continued for years after I was born. My first memories are her crying. She also used to get into violent swings and hit me, push me, call me names etc. We have worked very hard and have a good relationship now. I understand these actions were a result of her mental illness. I need to help her, before she hurts herself or someone else. 

Any advice? Any consolation?",16Jun2019,2
73,"So, my fiance and I have this debate about long shifts and exhaustion. He works 16 hours sometimes and I usually work 10 hours (2 separate jobs). I told him I am tired too and he just remarks, ""no you don't. Work my shift and then you get to say that."" Now the debate I make is: no matter the hours you work, you can still feel exhausted. Everyone is different. It's like saying if I got 7 hours of sleep and you got 5, I shouldn't be tired. Nor should I get to say that/complain.

77,"Warning:  Discussion of suicidal thoughts

&amp;#x200B;

This is one of those things where it's stupid and I know it's stupid and yet my brain is like, 'Are you sure you're sure?'

I was diagnosed about 10 years ago with ADHD and panic disorder.  I was mostly functioning until about a year ago, able to get rent paid and hold down a job enough to keep from being homeless, etc.  About a year and a half ago I moved in with some friends who agreed to let me sleep on their couch while I looked for a job in their city.  It was supposed to last for 2 months or so and then I figured I'd be on my way to making enough money to get my own little apartment.  About a month in I had a major breakdown, unlike one I'd ever had before, even the one that made me seek diagnosis in the first place.  I got so agoraphobic that I could barely leave the house and even got panicky when my roomies left me alone in the house.  I had a few panic attacks so bad that I considered killing myself, though those thoughts went away when the attack was done.  It was scary but I got back on my medication and my panic attacks lessened in severity and occurrence from having multiple daily to weekly to finally one or two a month.  Unfortunately, during this time I became completely non-functioning.  I had managed to get a job and lost it after three days due to my panic attacks.  Since then I've struggled to both get work and keep it, having gone through a total of 4 jobs in the last year.  While my panic attacks have gotten less frequent, my agoraphobia has remained so bad that I struggle to leave the house and driving is almost impossible.

I figured I could get better with just going out more and have tried to get out of the house with my very wonderful and supportive roomies, one of whom is my best friend.  I also started dating a guy long distance that I met through said best friend who is also very supportive and is open about his own mental health.  My big problem is that four days ago I had a major depressive episode of some kind.  I've thought about suicide or wanted to be dead in the past but largely this was more during panic attacks when my thoughts and heart were racing and I'd have done anything to make it stop or just very vague, abstract thoughts about it.  This was cold, rational, and lasted for several hours.  I knew exactly how I would do it and contemplated it carefully.  Most of my roomies weren't home because they were at an event and the ones that were were asleep.  I actually resented that people would miss me, meaning I couldn't kill myself.  I contemplated how upset with me they'd be if I failed and selfishly got angry about it and cried.

In the past I also feared going to hell and upsetting my dad (I don't have a good relationship with him) but I found during this moment that I didn't care about those things, only that it seemed like a crappy way to repay my friends for their kindness by being dead in their house.  I was scared of how I felt and thought about calling a hotline or waking one of my roomies who were home up to drive me to the hospital.  I didn't do either of those things, eventually just going to sleep when I wore myself out thinking about it.

I thought about not telling anyone about it but the two days, while I wasn't feeling suicidal, I felt completely apathetic.  Someone could have come up to me and stabbed me and I wouldn't have bothered to stop them, I felt numb and didn't feel happy or sad or angry or anything, just very tired.  Like I was just existing and it didn't matter what happened.  So I told my boyfriend and best friend about it, even considering checking into a mental facility of some kind.  Neither of them thought that was necessary since I reiterated that I didn't want to kill myself but was afraid I might at least hurt myself if I got so bad again.  My boyfriend recommended finding out-patient psychiatry and seeking help.  My best friend recommended I just try to get out and do more to build up my confidence in leaving the house and then I'd feel better.  I tried doing that this week but all it did was exhaust me, I didn't feel better, I didn't feel worse.  I called the place I had been trying to get in to see a therapist for 2 weeks and left another message (I left one a week ago too) but haven't heard back from them.

I don't really know where to go to be seen somewhere between 'I'm a danger and need to be seen now' and 'I can't live like this another month', especially with no income.  The place I've been trying to see is a low/no cost clinic and I haven't been able to get them to return my calls.  And today I felt different, not amazing but at least not numb.  The numbness was worse than being suicidal, honestly.  I was afraid I was completely losing my grip or maybe I had some *extra*, undiagnosed condition.  I felt energetic today, but unlike when I normally feel energetic, I didn't feel *happy* per-se, just a lack of negative emotion.  So I'm still worried but part of me wonders if it'll just go away and I'll be okay again, though even my okay for the last year hasn't been functional.",16Jun2019,1
79,"So I'm not really sure if it is social anxiety that I have because I have never seen a therapist. But I find it extremely difficult to socialise or make friends at all. I am desperate to change this and I have nowhere else to go.

I'm at a point where I can speak in front of a crowd, but not to people. Especially in group situations. I overthink everything, end up saying nothing, and just get excluded completely. I don't have much of a grasp on social cues and body language. Up until a few days ago, I didnt know that the appropriate thing to do when you're in a group conversation and have nothing to say is stay, listen, and react, instead of being stoic, and shrinking away. 

I want to help myself, and I don't want to end up being a loner with no friends except random people I meet online. If this isn't the right thread, I am so sorry. I'm just really tired of being alone, of being pitied for being alone, and honestly I'm also really tired of having to analyse every single social situation because I dont have the privilege of these things coming to me naturally as a result of proper socialization during childhood.

(F21)

Last year I came home from uni for summer and my dad broke down telling me he’d been struggling with alcoholism for the last few years, he cheated on mum and he was in a very dark place. He was struggling all summer and I tried to support him and my mum but it was tough seeing them both so sad, which took a toll on my already not so great mental health. 

I then completed another year of uni and when I’d gone home at Christmas dad seemed to be improving, and at half term/Easter he seemed to not be in the best headspace but still an improvement from last year. I had some therapy in this last year of uni since my mental health had gotten worse, and I wanted to tell my parents about it all (my mental health, self harm, and therapy) this summer because I really wanted emotional and financial support (for therapy) from them. However I come back from uni and dad is on the verge of a breakdown again since he lost his job and his and my mums relationship is very unhealthy. He’s really not doing well and he’s struggling to afford his own therapy and feels guilty for spending money on it as money is tight since he lost his job. He also told me that he feels like I am the only one who understands him and that he can talk to, but I am also struggling with my own mental health (although nowhere near as bad as his). I’m also counselling / being a messenger for mum and dads relationship since it’s quite toxic and I want to help them. 

So I really want to help dad because i love him so much and he’s really struggling. At the same time I’m really struggling with him telling me so much dark shit and seeing him so sad all the time and it makes me feel helpless and drained. I feel so selfish even thinking that, and maybe I wouldn’t say that if my mental health wasn’t as bad, but I did want to work on my own mental health this summer too so it wouldn’t affect me at uni next year like it did this year. I won’t tell my parents now about my mental health now because I don’t want to upset them more on top of everything they already have going on and I don’t want my dad to blame himself or my mum to blame him. 

How do I find a middle ground? How do I support my dad without it affecting my mental health without upsetting him/ making him feel alone/making him feel like he’s a burden?",16Jun2019,1

As someone from the UK who has dealt with mental health issues for years, I've noticed a lack of active UK spaces and would like to try and change that if there is the demand for it. Anyone is welcome to participate but I would prefer it if people who are not from the UK only talk about their specific healthcare processes/systems if relevant to a comments discussion rather than promoting it - just so we dont get swamped out/conflicting information due to uneven population.

I’ve been trying to work through my problems and I find I just do a better job of that when I’m on my own. I also just feel that they’re toxic, and I always get anxiety when I’m with them. They always want to do drugs/drink/ illegal things and they are almost never sober. Maybe I sound like a pretentious shit but that just doesn’t interest me anymore. It used to when we were first hanging out, but I feel like I just grew out of it. So I’ve stopped hanging out with them all together, and it feels so much better. It’s not like I hate them all as people, I just don’t have time anymore for that ridiculous group mentality of being off your ass every chance that you get. It’s stupid. The only problem is that those are my only friends, and without them I’m going to end up spending the summer alone.

88,"First, i would like to apologise for grammatical mistakes, english isn't my first language.
Second thing is, i'm sorry for the length of this post, it will be kinda autobiographical. 😃

So, since i can remember something was always off. I remember playing alone a lot, when i was a kid, i was always in my head somewhere, instead of communicating with others. When i was hanging out with other kids i never felt like i belonged there. There was one time when i was invited to my cuisins birthday party and i told her mom crying that i would like to go home, because i feel very outcasted, even though i wasn't i just felt like something was wrong. I made a little group of friends eventually, but then we moved to a different state when i was 10ish, where i didn't know anyone. I avoided talking to others because my social anxiety was so strong. (now looking back i can realize that anxiety started pretty early, but back then i didn't know what was wrong). Also everyone in that class was already friends with each other which made me feel very alone. It took me a couple of years but i could made two friend by the time we were in the end of 7th grade. One of my friend moved state and my other friend and i shifted away, because i never had any idea how to keep a friendship. Plus we all went to different high school.
I was pretty ""causually suicidal"" in my whole life, if i would've died in a random moment i wouldn't have cared, but i never actually had suicidal thoughts and that strong death wish until 2017. Which is weird because nothing remarkable actually happened in that year, everything was the same as always, but depression started to grew on me, i started to think of ending my life, i cut myself for six months.
Now its somewhat better. I don't harm myself, i don't have plans to kill myself or anything. Now i'm back to being casually suicidal.
But everything is so dull. I never in my life was so bored, nothing seems like fun, i don't know what i want to to with my life, but somehow i don't really care. Nothing seems to be interesting anymore. My hobbies are boring too. I don't even want to wake up in the morning.

89,"We had a happy first five years of marriage. I loved her unconditionally. But three years ago she had a mental breakdown. She had this horrible story about being taken from her bed and gang raped / tortured in a trap house over night. We ended up leaving our home and traveled half way across the country to stay with her parents. She thought people were following us all the way there. 
We took her to a clinic where she was diagnosed with schizophrenia. She got better after she started taking the medication. But after we moved out of her parents house and into a place near by, she stopped taking her meds. She said they were just sedating her. 
Her condition got worse again. Nightmares and paranoia. She can't figure out what's coming from her imagination and what's real. She became highly agitated. 
I managed to talk her into trying a different medication to alleviate her nightmares. Things got better again for about a year she even admitted that she feels better with these meds, but then we lost our health insurance and she stopped taking them again. 
It's been about six months. After some searching I have found a way we can afford the meds again, but she refuses to go to the appointments.
She's become abusive. Everything I say or do is met with aggression and criticism. She thinks up horrible stories about me that never happened. I feel like I'm going crazy myself. I can't sleep, I've lost over 30lbs and I can't stop shaking. I feel like I'm dying. Most recently she is claiming that I've raped her in her sleep. I'm sacred. I just want the pain to end but I don't want to abandon her. She needs help. When she's angry she says she hates me and wants me out of her life. But she always guilts me into coming back before I completely leave. Last time she kicked me out she left me with a black eye. I secretly tried to hang myself that night. She contacted me and convinced me to come back. When I came back I could see the guilt in her eyes, but it was not for me. She told me she was upset that everyone at work would find out that she's a ""monster bitch"". I don't think anyone noticed. 
I don't know what to do. I want to help her, but it seems like she dosent want my help. She believes I am the cause of all of these problems now. Maybe I am. Maybe she would be better off without me.",16Jun2019,1

91,"This dreamlike feeling started when I was 9. At first I think it was just a coping mechanism to deal with stress, but as I've gotten older (as with the rest of my mental health), it's gotten worse. Now I don't know when I'm dreaming or not, or if my dreams are real. Often I have dreams within dreams, which makes it even more difficult. My dreams are often very surreal, but they can also be incredibly life like. It almost feels like I'm in inception but I have no control over anything. Other times I don't think anything exists, and this has practically become permanent. There's no way I can reason with myself that what I see is real, and it's not just a incredibly detailed dream, matrix like simulation, or something of the sort. I'm kinda scared that I'm falling into the same thinking habits of extremely paranoid conspiricists or something. Combined with my suicidal thoughts, all I want to do is die, but what if there is no real escape? What if it's all just a loop or something. I don't know where I'm meant to go with anything like this. I also often feel like I'm being watched, and like something bigger has control of my life. Sometimes it's just that everything is predetermined, other times I feel like I am a puppet to some higher being. Sometimes I feel like there's always something in the corner of my eye that's always watching. Also, starting last September I starting getting Weird feelings. Not like hullucinations, but because I have a very good imagination they are close to it. Like I'm rotting, worms are eating, bugs and needles beneath my skin, or needles pressing in. Little wires in bundles just under my skin that I want to pull out. Once I got the urge to cut off my right hand, cook myself up to my elbow, and then eat it. I think this is because I sometimes used to smell death (like road kill) or other smells of burning meat, but kinda off.",16Jun2019,2
92,"(Throwaway account, this will also be pretty long. I’m curious if anyone else has similar experiences). 

Mental illness runs through my family, so it isn’t anything I’m unfamiliar with. I deal with my own shit and it’s tough, so I just want to make it clear that there is no judgements here whatsoever. 

All my life I’ve been exposed to watching my parents try to kill each other. Easy way to put it. They have an arranged marriage, and as you can probably guess, it didn’t turn out so well. They’re technically separated, but they’ve lived together because my mom can’t support herself. We moved to America when I was young and her family is still across the ocean so she doesn’t have anyone here. And she also despises my dads side of the family. Over the years, as I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized that my parents marriage didn’t work out because of her mental illnesses. (At least it plays a huge role.) depression, bi polar, anxiety, and schizophrenia. That’s a whole lot on her plate and it makes it twice as harder when she denies that she has these to begin with. 

I’m going to explain the way she acts and what she says and does and I just want to know if anyone else deals with it. 

She screams a lot. Like not full on blown screaming, but she will spends days and days just arguing and screaming and basically speaking gibberish. It’s like she’s talking to my dad herself, even when he’s not around. Like, if he’s home, and she’s in a bad mood, she will scream at him till he leaves because it gets so unmanageable. And when he’s not home, she’ll act like he is, and say very very inappropriate things. It’s so hard to explain. She’s basically just talking to herself for hours, very angrily. She speaks in her first language, which I think is like slavian? So I only really understand bits and pieces. But for example, she’ll make a lot of sexual comments or how she’s happy that my dads family has died or even that she’ll kill them herself. Times ten. 

We’ve moved quite a few times because she also has a habit of taking it out on our neighbors. She thinks everyone is out to get her and I know that’s a comment effect of schizophrenia. Or she’ll take her screaming/yelling outside or in public and it’s really hard to understand why she does that. I have to constantly tell her to knock it off and she’ll just tell me to shut up. But no matter where we are, she will make it a mission to make sure everyone knows what she does and says, even if she doesn’t do it on purpose, you know? It’s a lot of pressure to deal with for all of us because we have all these people not knowing what is exactly is wrong and just assumes that we’re a family full of crazies. 

She keeps all of her children (4) very closed off from the world. Nothing too serious, but she tries to get us to not talk to anyone and she thinks the internet and our cell phones are the reason why bad things happen to us. Does that make sense? We’re all level headed though and don’t let her stop us from trying to live a normal life but it really puts a limit of some of the things we can do. When I used to be in school, and she woke up in a bad mood, she would call me out for the day and not let me go to school. This could happen for days in a row. She thinks the teachers or students are harassing us and even has stated she believes that they are all pedos and rapists. 

There’s a thousand more things I could list but my brain is kinda all over the place now. I’m 19 and all of my life I’ve had to watch this and listen to it and figure it out on my own. I used to hate my parents because of the way they raised all of us and the fact they allowed us to be raised in such a toxic and dangerous environment. Having to stop your parents from literally beating each other to death is very traumatizing and having to deal with a mother who is too unstable to even raise her kids changes your outlook on life real quick. We’ve tried to get her help but she refuses because she doesn’t think anything is wrong with her. I’ve grown to understand that this isn’t anything I have control over and I’ve moved on from it for the most part. But sometimes I just wish I knew how to get it to stop.

95,"For the past four years I have been obsessive with certain things and then soon after loose interest, this goes for new friendships, new religion, hobbies like crafting, new career paths. I will get a bright idea and then obsess over it to which it will take up almost all of my focus, then I am unable to stick with it after a very short time.

I then get down on myself and discouraged that I’m unable to stick with something and “master” it. 

I say for the past 4 years because I used to have an alcohol and drug problem where that was my main focus and “hobby” I am 4 years sober now. First I jumped right into AA and after a while lost interest, then picked up hobbies (at different times) like guitar, knitting, crochet, sewing, scrapbooking, all to which I would learn how, then take up a lot of my time energy and focus crafting (I would do a project for hours all day and night until it was done then never pick it up again) 

Then I became a born again Christian, obsessed over that for about a month, then thought “No I’m not Christian, must be Wiccan” then did that for a week, along with obsessing over the occult. Now I’m over than and back to spirituality.

I recently started obsessing over Crystals and Chakra Healing. That had fizzled down for me. 

Ive attempted to learn how to garden and studied that for a week straight even tho I lived in an apartment and had no area for a garden. 

All of these hobbies I would go out and buy all these supplies and spend so much money just to have it collecting dust. 

I began trying to apply for collage all though I have no idea what I want to take, luckily I put that on hold for now. Decided to apply for an old job and went for the interview, offered the job, accepted and at the last second I resigned before I even started to open a home business. 

I feel like my mind is scattered all over the place and I can’t commit to one idea.

With friendships I will meet a new person and we will talk everyday and dive deep into each other’s lives and past and then slowly start pulling away to the point of not even talking. These friendships last a few months, usually start a new friendship when I make a life change, like an AA friend or a Christian friend or a Wiccan friend. Then I feel like a shit friend for flaking. 

Idk what this is, depression? Bi polar? Social Anxiety? Just lost after sobering up trying to fill a void the addiction left?

97,"Hey guys, im new here and i kinda want to make myself feel better by writing here. I hope this is okay.

So my childhood is awful. My mother left us when i was really young, ive never seen her personally since then, but we communicate sometimes through social media. I was left under the hands of my very abusive father. He's okay when he's calm or relaxed but everytime he gets angry or triggered about the littlest things. I was physically beaten many times and until now he shouts and says bad things to me. Im 19 btw and i still live with him. He throws things at me and the most recent incident was he got angry because i told him something that was meant to be a joke, he went off and told me things like ""prostitute"" ""you should kill yourself"" and threw plates at me, luckily i didnt get shards of glasses stuck in my skin lol.

So i know something's wrong with my head. Often times i feel like shouting with no particular reason. I feel like the people around me should only pay their attention to me and i get jealous or disappointed when they dont. When a guy tells me that he likes me, i would tell him to just find another girl and when he finally does, i get jealous also. My personality is also really different when im at home and when im with other people. I used to pretend to have things i actually didn't, and i used to tell people scenarios that didn't really happen to me. 

Please help me identify what's wrong with me and how i can make myself get better.",16Jun2019,2

101,"Well long story short;

Im 20 years old and I have been bullied until I was 12, in this time my trust in people has decreased as I was trusting to some people and they just threw it away to join the pack bullying me. Ever since then I had difficulty opening myself up to people. And I lost a bit of my self confidence as well.

About half a year ago I met this girl which is in a class lower than me, but I pretty much never talked to her until I randomly met her when going out and talked to her for an hour plus when everything was closed. (This is something I pretty much never do). Ive started texting with her afterwards and we kept getting closer, until we got so close she opened up about her depression and this made something in me open up to her aswell. We were really close and she was the only one I was willing to give a hug as I normally dont give them out. Everything went well until I gave her a kiss on the cheek to show my love for her, but apparently she once told me she didnt really like that beforehand a little while before. After this it went kind of downwards and we got in a fight, I tried to get her trust a bit back but she couldnt. I tried to keep in touch with her as I didnt want to lose someone this special to me.

It all seemed to go well until recently, as I kept my distance for a while and I recently asked if we could talk again if I would see her again when going out. As Im not going to be able to pass this year and am going to be in her class next year.

She told me that she didnt want to as our conversations dont really interest her, this just broke my heart. I tried to open up to her and she was really close to me, I even fell in love with her in the beginning, and she would then be my first girlfriend. In which direction it seemed to go.

Now I just feel like Im not interesting to people and Im not really socially capable. This just left me clueless on what to do as I can see myself less willing to open up and might not ever want to do it again. Whenever she is around I have my attention on her and I just want to be able to talk to her again, but she keeps being evasive. Eventhough she can just normally talk to everyone else. This makes these feelings about myself even worse.

I know I have to get over this, but I find it really difficult and dont know how to. As I dont see myself find someone else like her in this state.

103,"Okay so I have been struggling with anxiety for a few years, and I have always tried to handle it on my own. I am stubborn as hell 😂 
Recently though, I have started considering seeing a psychologist. Mostly because I am in a new relationship with an amazing hooman. My anxiety is limiting me from being the best version of myself for the relationship. I can feel my anxiety creeping into my relationship and limiting it in other ways too. I am just so over the struggle, you know? It gets tiring.

Anyway so if the psychologist feels like I can benefit from meds, I might be open to try it. I just want to understand how different kinds of meds affect you overall, how tou feel on them, how it affects your personality etc. Does the good outweigh the bad?",16Jun2019,1

106,"So I recently moved my daughter and I in with my boyfriend who recently graduated from medical school. I also graduated but just my AA and am continuing to pursue my BA come Fall. 
Normally, he is the calm put together one. We talked about how we need routine and structure, not just for us but for our children, and we have been working towards that. 
Unfortunately, we had a lice break out and I handled that because he didnt know how to handle the stress. It was sort of like the lights are on but nobodys home? 
Well, Friday evening we had a minor miscommunication after the kids were in bed and then a few minutes after hes informed me he took some pills to calm down. Well, I stayed up practically all night (give or take a few hours) watching him cause his breathing was really odd. At 545AM I woke up and there was puke all over him, couch covers, and couch. I tried waking him but he was incoherent so I took the kids downstairs and fed them breakfast. Later on he tried to get up and broke a vase on accident down the basement stairs so I cleaned that up and got him to lay back down. I tried telling him five different times before 11am that he needed to wake up for his appointment but he wouldn't budge. I took care of his daughter along with mine for the entire day, he slept all day, and while I was watching them I spent hours with the girls cleaning and organizing his room because I knew he had wanted to do that and I had Hoped it would make him feel better about his environment having more structure and motivate him to discuss routine with me. I wrote on his to do list ""Love yourself"" in bright colors and put it on the stand by his meds. Upon waking up he had decided that I am the reason he missed his appointment, my daughter is exhausting, I have everything to gain and he doesn't, and said something like ""we already made this stupid mistake and now we have to live with it."" He was attempting to drive in this condition, went to go take more pills but we stopped him. I put the girls to bed after taking care of them on like two hours of sleep and trying to lift his spirits and show him through my actions how much he means to me. He kept telling me I need to come up with 2000 bucks for the downpayment of this apartment because hes been supporting me and my daughter (2000 is not what he spent on my daughter and I at all)
 Then today I had to get him up because his daughter needed to go to the meeting place to go back to her mothers and he still could barely talk and was texting. She knew by the way he was messaging he was doing something destructive. He answered finally like the 15th time she tried to  call and put her on speaker. She was saying ""Who is taking care of our daughter?!"" Repeatedly in panic and he wasnt answering her so I was like this is messed up, being a mom I wouldn't want that done to me, so I picked up the phone and explained, she was already only five min away. She thanked me for watching her and went downstairs. When she came up she told his dad that the daughter was gonna be staying away for a little while but she didnt talk like it was permanent. When I went downstairs hes the wing shit all over the room to where i curled up in a ball to protect myself saying I need to get out because of me and haley he lost his daughter and  he didnt start going into a downward spiral u tol I came along and hes resentful because hes told me he needs routine and we wont have the conversation and hes sick of my daughter parenting me. He keeps pushing me away and telling me hes sorry hes not who I thought he was but then goes back to he loves me and we just need to hire a nanny. How do I handle this situation? I understand he has a mental illness but some of this seems very immature to me and like he needs to grow up and realize life is hard sometimes. I wasnt happy he did all this, especially with the kids both being here. He keeps saying I dont have his back when his father wanted to call an ambulance numerous times over the weekend and i was the one talking him out of it because i didnt want him to lose his medical license when hes got $250,000 in student loan debt to pay off. 
Is there some suggestions on how I can help him? How I can talk to him about this? He literally told me I dont support him, I dont understand him, and i have no reason to be mad at him after i tried reassuring him that i still love him and im not mad at him. I told him he needs to forgive himself and to stop beating himself up and stop lashing out. Hes sleeping now and told me to let him sleep it off. If theres any advice I could get it would be greatly appreciated. I love him and I want to help him any way I can so that he may help himself. Thank you.",16Jun2019,1

I absolutely envelop myself in the topic and i'm enjoying it so much. Just this absolute manic love and rage, and then I start to crash and I feel like I've wasted so much time and just slink into a depressive state. But the strange thing is, i'm not just bored.

Have you ever had a coffee and went on a massive raid online for some type of topic for hours, and then you just drop it randomly? It's kind of like that but it doesnt involve coffee, it just happens.  Im aware i'm using terminology related to Bipolar Disorder, and I've tried to attribute some aspects to that but I just don't know how to word properly what it is I'm trying to say.

109,"TW: Self harm.
Yesterday I was laying on my best friends bed because I was pretty tired and she was sitting on the edge of the bed.

I was extremely shocked to the point I was nauseous because I care about her so much.

She has never seen like someone who would self harm, but I really wouldn’t know. We’re really close but I always seem to be the one that vents.

112,"I just need some help editing and i thought that here would be the best place to ask considering the topic, anyway here goes nothing:

 

For a little while now any words associated with mental health have been taboo. People still don’t like to talk about it, but because of this - people can’t possibly understand how complex mental health can be. We just take the words ‘mental health’ and most of the time just think of it as a euphemism for being ‘crazy’, but this is not the case. There is such a broader, widely recognised spectrum nowadays that people don’t really pay attention to. This attitude is mostly due to the media spreading stigma and stereotypes to its audience. The media are largely at fault for spreading incorrect statistics and mainly introducing the stigma around mental health for a long while now. Many people believe stereotypes like: those who suffer from mental health issues are ‘lazy’ or ‘oversensitive’, ‘childish’ and even just plain ‘crazy’, this was proved in surveys conducted by both the National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health.

Depression is not being sad all the time- every person who experiences it; experiences it differently, people can stop enjoying hobbies, be tired all the time and not want to get out of bed even though they were fine the day before, be irritable, not eat because they aren’t hungry or they can’t be bothered, or overeating because they’re bored and feel empty – it’s not just about wanting to commit suicide. Depression isn’t just a constant feeling of sadness, depression can be hidden in happiness; it’s not just because you don’t smile. And, it’s not just being grumpy or bored or without motivation. Depression is an illness, and it physically disturbs the way the brain works-this is something I don’t think enough people know about. The brain is an organ. Mental illnesses are illnesses of that organ. Brain scans show that there is a physical difference between a healthy brain and a brain with depression or anxiety or any other mental health issue. Telling someone, “You’re not really sick. It’s all in your head.” is like telling someone with asthma , “It’s not real, it’s all in your lungs.” The brain is an organ that can malfunction as much as any other organ.

Anxiety attacks, for one, aren’t always hyperventilating and rocking back and forth. They can take different forms like unpredictable bouts of irritability, hypersensitivity to any sort of change or chaos, stuttering, stumbling over words, not talking at all or staring into space. Not every anxiety attack is the same. Everyone deals with anxiety and depression differently because everyone is different. A typical stereotype to do with anxiety is linking it to being just a little shy, especially in movies with the portrayal of the typical quiet female character, whom the audience immediately see as cute. Thinking anxiety is cute is like saying excessive sweating, having a dry mouth, physically shaking, blacking out, having nausea, heart palpitations, chest pain, shallow breathing, stuttering and humiliating yourself is cute. It’s not just a little shy giggly girl with pretty skirts and flowers in their hair. This representation of anxiety stems from the media in films, books and more. Having anxiety and depression is becoming fashionable, and this should not be the case.

113,"This is long but please read, I need help and a second opinion before something bad happens.

Let’s have a bit of background/exposition:

I’m 19(M), I am healthy and I’m decent shape, got nothing to be depressed about, virgin, never dated anyone. A few months ago I had a friend(M) try to sexually assault me during an acid trip, I’ve only told one person about it. Messed up with a girl and it fucked me up bad, had about a week of just terrible depression. Another female friend wanted to fuck with me but I didn’t want to ruin the friendship so I turned her down. Friend asked if I was gay because of that, didn’t think anything of it and said no. Later that day I thought about it again and had a a panic attack I guess, I don’t find other guys attractive nor do I want to be with them. I got better after a few days but now I feel like I have something to hide when I’m around my friends. 

About 2 weeks ago I started having thought loops, terrible terrible thoughts run through my head now. I’ve never been suicidal, I am now. First a thought of “am I bisexual” ran through my head, I thought maybe/maybe not, it’s hard to know, I struggled with it for a bit and finally accepted that maybe I am. I thought things would get better, they actually got worse, since it didn’t feel better, the thought of “am I actually a girl in a man’s body?” ran through my head. Now the bisexual bit, I can see maybe being plausible, not 100% sure on it but I can’t rule it out. The transsexual bit makes no sense to me, and I don’t know where the thoughts came from. I’ve never crossed dressed, I’ve never thought of being a girl, I’m in a fraternity and love it, I don’t have problems with my body nor my facial hair, I’m actually growing out a beard atm as well. Just today the thought of “am I a furry?” hit me and that makes no sense at all, I’ve always seen them as weird as hell and thought furries were toxic. I can’t determine where all this has come from.

These thoughts consume me and disgust me, I hate my mental state and I don’t know where these thoughts have come from, I’m thinking I could maybe be bipolar or have some form of OCD but I don’t know. I am unable to see a therapist because I won’t be able to join the military if I do so. Is this just a phase I’m going through maybe? About half the day I’m in a decent or sometimes even good mood but then my chest starts aching and hurting and  these thoughts rush in.

119,"im not sure how to start this, since theres a lot of stuff to put together in order for this to make sense and i really just need to get it out in a way that wont hurt me. also sorry if its a long read

about 5 years ago was when i really got hit with depression, anxiety and further along i became borderline bipolar (ive never and still to this day dont take medication for it). my parents were never nice to each other and constantly fought. my mother was emotionally abusive towards me and my siblings and would blame us for things that werent in our control. my father, as much as he tried, was and still is really absent from my life (my parents have been divorced since i was born). i never felt like i could truly rely on someone to help me, even the countless counselors and therapists i saw.

the beginning of my freshman year in high school i made a plan to kill myself. i was tired of feeling out of control, not being able to be heard by anyone and not being able to fit in (i was made fun of for hanging around guys mostly. i was a huge tomboy at the time). it didnt feel like anyone could really understand the situation i was in. the only reason i didnt follow through with it was because my best friend (who is now my boyfriend) immediately took me under his care. once i told him the situation, his first reaction was ""Are you okay? Do you need anything? What can I do to help?"" and those were questions that i was never really asked, and it meant so much to me. literally every day after that he would text me at some point and ask me how i was feeling. most of the time i would just say ""the same"" or ""worse"" or just ""okay"" but just the fact that he made the time to ask me meant a lot and it kept me going, even though it was really rough. id say its safe to say that he saved me from suicide, and im more than grateful for him and for what hes done for me.

fast forward to the end of my senior year. here i think is where i made the biggest improvement with my depression. i was feeling confident about myself, it had been months since i had last hurt myself, i could look at a situation and figure out the best outcome so i dont get hurt and i felt like i could really be in control of my life again. it didnt really last too long though. ive been approached by my father (who i live with) who told me that he was planning on moving out of state to be with his parents again and wanted to know if i wanted to come with.

this wouldnt be a problem, however its a struggle to try and figure out where im going to live. i want to stay close to my boyfriend, as hes become a really important part of my life and i dont know what i would do without him. that also means that i would have to stay in state, where my mother lives. as much as i want to believe that shes changed, it never happened and shes still as passive-aggressive as she was five years ago, and i dont want to stay with her. my boyfriends mother has been kind enough to let me stay with her but as long as i have a plan to move out within this year, which im totally fine with and completely understand. i want to be out and living by myself. however, i dont have enough money with the income i have to move out by the end of this year and i dont feel comfortable enough with a roommate (im that kid who looks at a group project in class and does it herself because i know the best job will come from me and not a group of slackers,). So again, staying with my boyfriends mom wouldnt be that big of a problem. i can find another job to work and make a little more than i am now. however, my mother has some strong beef with my bf's mom that i wont get into but i will say that it was not nice between the two of them and neither of them are willing to get along unless the other person apologizes first.

and knowing my mother, she *will* come after me and my boyfriends family if i dont stay with her. its a whole jealousy thing i think, but what will happen is unknown and incredibly terrifying to me. but i also know that it could be the best decision for me.

so, what does this whole thing have to do with my dependency? ive grown very attached to my boyfriend, obviously for everything hes done for me and for what hes saved me from. we both share mutual feelings of wanting the best for each other and trying to make time and whatnot. overall id say its a pretty healthy relationship. even when i have my bipolar moments he doesnt push me away, rather he literally sits there with me until ive calmed down and is then willing to listen and talk. i dont think i can stress enough just how much i love him and how much i care about him.

but recently things have been going downhill again. my boyfriend loves to be social and get high sometimes. i do as well, so thats not the problem i have. the relationship i have with my friends is kind of weird. theyre mostly my boyfriends friends, so i feel like i kind of tag-a-long a lot but they still like to hang out with me. theres this one kid however that i dont like at all. hes the kind of person that when you get around him you get that feeling that if you stay around them, something bad will happen. this kid is really impulsive and is pretty rude to everyone except for my boyfriend. so whenever hes around, i tend not to be there. but my boyfriend is really the only person i feel comfortable hanging around. ive noticed that whenever its just me and him and he asks if one of his friends can come over, i get kind of pissy. i dont want to and i know i shouldnt be mad at him for just wanting to hang out with his friends, but i cant help but feeling that way.

recently as well i feel like ive been pouring my heart out to help him in any way i can or just taking my day to do something for him. driving him around places, pitching in to get weed, buying things for him and whatnot. but i havent been feeling the same thing being reciprocated. on his birthday, i drove to so many stores trying to find something to give him, and i put everything together in a cute little bag for him that i made. i wanted him to realize the importance of the bag and what was in it. i presented it to him at a bowling alley i met him at, but he was more interested in being around his friends, which was okay, if about ten minutes prior he had actually assisted me in a panic attack i had outside the alley in my car. it bugged me because while i was in this attack, he told me he would come to my car, so i felt pretty relieved for a moment. then not even five minutes later he told me to go inside because everyone showed up. it really felt like he had just forgotten about me and it hurt really bad considering what i had been doing for him earlier that day. (he was also high at that point, and i know he gets really oblivious, as anyone does, so it hurt even more)

yesterday, i wanted to spend some time with him before he leaves for a camping trip today (i couldnt go because i have work :P). but the entire day i was doing things for other people. i drove his brother to his driving appointment, i took my bf to an atm to pull out some money, i begrudgingly listened to him invite a friend over (whom he would be with for the next four days camping) and didnt say anything about it. when his friend showed up, i sat for two hours doing nothing while he hung out with his friend. and after those two hours, i drove him to meet our dealer who took half an hour to just show up to the meeting area. at that point, it was already 1230 in the morning, and i told my dad i would be home around 1. i was and still am really upset about how it went down, when the entire reason i went to be with him was exactly that. to hang out with him.

i relapsed and hurt myself a few days ago because i felt like i was intruding on him and the time he has with his friends and i really feel like i couldve been better about these situations. i beat myself up so badly in my head and told myself that i could figure this out to make it work and ill do it myself because it was my fault. even though now sober from those thoughts i know its nearly impossible to do it like that because its never worked in the past, and now i feel even more ashamed of myself for what ive done.

im not sure if i have too high of a standard for him, and i think this is because ive grown to be so dependent on him for just about everything since i didnt get that when i needed it the most from the people who shouldve been there for me. i would say hes literally my rock. honestly i cant really tell anymore if im just being overdramatic or selfish or if im really justified in my reasons. thank you for reading this and any help would be great.",16Jun2019,1
120,"In the past i have dealt with depression, anxiety and self loathing a lot but managed to put myself in a good place now.

Lately I have had some things happen to me that caused a chain reaction which ended up in a crying session on the kitchen floor. Turns out that the biggest problem i have right now (or still have since my childhood) is that i sometimes feel i am not good enough.

Suicide of course is no joke, but what is it with people wanting to share how miserable they are all the time? I suppose it interests me.

123,"This past week or so has been pretty rough for me (23/m). This is also my first time actually time talking about how I feel to anybody really. I feel bad for feeling like this cause I know I don’t have it nearly as bad as other people but I can’t help it. But, I really hate myself, i hate the the way I look, the way I sound, everything about me. I try my hardest not to look at mirrors or reflections cause I’m disgusted by what I see. Im overweight, but currently working on it and  successfully losing weight, but I’m worried it’s going to end up like every other time I’ve tried to lose weight and failed. I had a really intense panic attack this afternoon that lasted several hours, longer than any attack has lasted before. My grandfather died a few days ago, and I’ve failed in feeling much emotion about it. And that makes me feel even worse. A good friend that I’ve been talking to for a while and falling head over heels for (and have been told by other people that she felt the same way about me)  recently, in the past few weeks or so, seems like she’s been withdrawing, we used to have week long conversations that I looked forward too but recently it’s been: 3-6 hours between every reply, and the replies I do get, seem to me like she doesn’t have anything to add to the conversation. I know I should ask her and tell her how I feel. But I’m a coward, I’ve developed a “ignorance is bliss” mentality that I know isn’t good for me. I’m scared to know that her answer will be that she’s gotten over me and is on to bigger and better things. I regularly fantasize about dying, not suicide, but dying in a way that I can be useful for once in my life, maybe giving my life for someone else, or in a way that was out of my control. I’m sure I won’t be missed much if at all and would be quickly forgotten and replaced. I’m terrified of revealing these feelings to friends and family, I’m scared that they will start treating me differently, start pitying me. I don’t want people to feel like they have to walk on eggshells around me. I told a close friend of mine about a year and half ago that I was probably suffering from depression, he didn’t seem to care and never brought it up again or asked me about. It just seems easier not having to live through these feelings of insignificance and uselessness. My job Is draining the life out of me, the pay is not enough to even move out of my parents, and barely enough to pay my bills each month. but I have no other option. I’ve been applying to many many jobs but have been unsuccessful. It feels like everybody around me is moving at a thousands miles an hour, getting good jobs, relationships, buying houses, marriage and children, and I’m stuck in crawling speed with no way out. I know my problems were cause by me not sharing or say anything and allowing it to get to this point where it’s hard to face the day each morning, another reason why I hate myself, I’m too prideful (or scared) to open up to people close to me. I can feel my self drifting farther and farther away from the people I love and I don’t know how to stop. I don’t know what to do. Maybe I just want someone to at least pretend like they care or listen, Or maybe just a hug.... I don’t know anymore. I’ve found solace in the bottom of a bottle, but my family has a history of alcoholism, and I don’t want to end up like that. I try not use that as a coping mechanism. But sometimes it’s the only thing that at least give me a little bit of relief. If this is the wrong sub for this I’m sorry.

126,"I've been dealing with mental health issues for a while. I know I have these problems and I want to get help, but i don't know where to turn. I was diagnosed with a severe gastrointestinal disorder when I was 9, that's when it started. I'm not going to detail everything I've gone through cause I know nobody wants to here that, but I will say the issues that im still dealing with. At first i didn't want to get help. I didn't think there was anything wrong with me. I just didn't have any motivation, I was tired, lonely, and every day felt super repetitive. I didn't want to go to sleep because I didn't want to wake up and start a day all over again. It got to the point where I would stay up all night and sleep away most of the day. I lost about 30lbs. Then I started to figure out that there was something wrong. So I tried telling some close friends I was feeling this way, mind you I didn't think it was depression at the time and this was the first time I told anyone, and they told me that there is know way I can have problems like that because im popular and super social, which generally I was. so that kinda invalidated all of my feelings at the time and I started putting myself down for ""feeling like i had a right to complain"" because there were people who had ""real issues"". I didn't do anything and just put up with it and lived day to day for the next while. (I know that I was wrong in thinking that now, but sometimes those thoughts still come into my head) 

At the time I was a freshmen in high school (I'm currently only 16) and high school wasn't great. I have adhd, so it was really hard to get my work done even though i knew the material, but it made me feel stupid. I felt like I was useless. and the fact the people go around flaunting the fact that they have adhd (even if they don't) to seem ""cool"" or to use as an excuse to be lazy. If it came up in a conversation I never said anything because I didn't want people to have those misconceptions about me. (and adhd doesn't make you lazy, i was able to pull of mostly A's and im even graduating early)  , but all these issues with my adhd ended up in me being taken out of school, i was being %100 home schooled for the next semester. the problem with this being im very dependent on people, i getting super depressed if i don't see people or get outside my house enough, this continued through summer and I didnt really see anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

Ugh im starting to rant, sorry.

what I'm trying to get across is I get very lonely and depressed when i dont have enough contact with other people.

&amp;#x200B;

scoot forward passed 2 befriends completely ditching me for a romantic relationship. and we enter probably the happiest point in my life. 

i was in a play at the local community theater, and the whole cast got close really quick, i was happier then i had ever been, and i fell in love. I know some people are gonna say its not love, you don't know what that is you're only 16, which i get, and if it didnt happen to me id probably say the same thing too. i did fall in love. there were a few issues though, i was a minor, and she was an adult. i told my parents and they were ok with it as long as we stayed safe. and fyi WE DIDNT DO ANYTHING ILLEGAL, just wanted to get that out of the way. but i soon found out that she was extremely depressed, im not going to say everything that happened during that relationship , but i will say that I poured all of my self into trying to help and being with her, i know i couldn't ""save"" her but i wanted to try and help. A lot of stuff happened she ended up in the hospital a few times and i ended up getting really hurt. it was sinking me into my issues even more. it was around 2 and a half months ago that I tried to commit suicide, I took 5 pills of my adhd meds, which the internet said would kill me, i didnt die. fast forward to a little over a month ago, we broke up. Ive tried to get over her. i've  tried flirting with other girls. i still love her. and i tried getting professional help.

&amp;#x200B;

And now im here, none of its working, I feel so dead inside. I don't even feel like moving. im sad all the time. I miss her all the time, no matter how much i try to cut her out of my thoughts. I'm so tired of feeling like this, im so exhausted. i don't know where else to look. This is my final cry for help.

128,"I don’t know if this is just me or, does anyone else feel as though once they’ve gone through a big step of being so down and low with Mental Health for months and maybe even years and then finally gotten over it that people might think you’re lying if you feel as though all those bad thoughts are coming back?

The reason I ask is I used to have really bad Mental Health where I’d often attempt to kill myself and be Sectioned. I never knew the reason behind all of this and I was often told there may never be a trigger behind it. I often have the question posed to me “how would your mother feel if you killed yourself?” And I would often answer at the time “I would be dead, I wouldn’t need to know how her or anyone would feel about this”. 

However I eventually got around it all and have become a better person, not just in myself but in relationships too also. 

However, more recently I seem to be feeling quite low and feel as though my existence in life is very pointless as eventually everyone in the end would die so it feels pointless going through life when eventually, everyone ends up the same. 

I feel as though if I told anyone, my GP, the Crisis Team or even a family member how I’ve been feeling recently no one would believe me? When I was Sectioned I was often asked “if you wanted to kill yourself you would’ve done it. So why haven’t you?”  It’s as if I wasn’t believed back then. People who have never had mental health issues now a days like my family and friends would never believe me and think that I was lying. Im too afraid to speak the truth sometimes.",16Jun2019,1
129,"It’s gunna b long (even tho it’s a pretty condensed version of my life lol) but issa wild ride

And maybe I’m just ranting but it’d be nice to see what someone thinks of my train wreck life (if anyone even reads it)

Alrighty well basically I’ve got an entire childhood of trauma n stuff built up (never been to a professional except when I was like 10 for add and one (1) single session I will brush up on in a min) but from what I can gather within the past few years of my life I’ve suffered from disassociation(primarily in hs I have graduated) depression and anxiety. There was a point were my depression and anxiety pretty much balanced each other out so I was pretty much fluctuating between the mentality of not giving a frick and giving all the fricks. 

Breezing over the events and childhood trauma, I lived with an aunt until I was 16. She had almost no legal control over me, and last I heard of her she had the irs on her booty for trying to claim me on taxes. Pretty much I ran away to stay with a good friends family, and in an attempt to get me to move back with said aunt she booked me an appointment with a therapist. 

I have no idea how much time I was even allowed in that office, lol, but two and a half hours after spilling my life the guy was looking at me like a chicken with its head cut off. I said, “so, yeah, I’m depressed,” and he said, “completely understandable.” I only point this out Incase someone tries to say ‘uh don’t self diagnose’- allow me to inform you I do, in fact, have a very good understanding of psychology, and I do, in fact, have a brain capable of drawing reasonable conclusions. 

Anyways, skipping over the details of the drama, the good family friend was the dad of one of my friends. Not even sure how it started but pretty much slam dunked myself into the suicide culture. Now, ofc, I hate it, but at the time my friend (and theirs) were the closest thing I had to family at the time(need a repeat: childhood trauma=no close family). So, I was pretty much absorbed into their family. 

For, like, a year. 

During this time, there were two common themes: hating life, and drugs. Lotta marijuana. Long story short, this separated me from any remaining friends I had besides one friend, and got kicked out. Decide ‘screw it, I’ll just move to another state with my toxic friend who introduced me to drugs and this toxic culture’. 

Y’all can imagine how that went. They lasted around three (3) months before breaking down and moving back. (Should mention I graduated hs a year early, bit of a smart ass so school was not a concern at this point)

Pretty much those 3 months were probably one of the lowest points in my life. Friend was manipulative, basically saw me as an idiot and constantly made fun of me (over things and aren’t even make-fun-of-worthy- ie: That I was ‘diabetic’ (I was .1 into the prediabetic range at one point... my BMI is 15); that I was Bigfoot (I don’t like shaving); that I was a virgin (like I’m proud I am? At least I didn’t have rebound sex with my ex bf’s twin. Yes this is a call out); stupid stuff, yk) 

Confidence? Self esteem? Don’t know her. Never got into self harm; suicide, though, was a present thought 24/7. Lowest night: friend told me I was the reason she was leaving and she hated me, so... cool. See ya in hell, you manipulative son of a-

Took me one (1) whole month to get out of that mindset. To understand that I wasn’t who I was made out to be. It also involved a disgusting amount of drugs, but, who was to stop me? 

Have you ever actually been completely alone? To look at your contacts, on your new phone, and realize the only contact you had to put in was your boss? No mom, dad, sibling, bff? 

Welcome to solitude, and may I just call an ittie bitty bs on the “needing human touch to survive” thing cuz I’m goin on three years since I’ve genuinely received a hug and I’m still chillin. 

During that completely alone time, though, my depression might have decreased but anxiety made the biggest cameo in history. 

I’m still not 100% sure, though it’s the best theory I could come up with, but I believe I actually got arrhythmia from how stressed I was. I was pretty much homeless, living in my car, hitting up strangers and finding excuses to spend the night @their house (I am female and this was in a college town, so...(still got the v card lol)) 

Eventually, I get an opportunity. Move out of country. Live stress free, don’t gotta worry bout anything. 

It all worked out. Now, I b chillin. I started talking to my sister and dad again, since I sorta found out the reason they stopped talking to me was bc when I was younger aunt said I didn’t want to talk to them(she was a manipulative c***)

So, yeah. 
Anxiety? Gone. 
Arrhythmia? Only when I get stressed. 
Hotel? Trivago. 
Disassociation? Gone. 
ADD? Yeah, that one aint leaving lol. 
Drugs? Quit. 
Depression? I don’t know. 

I don’t feel the same kind of empty as I did before, the lack of motivation, either it’s gone or I just have gotten too used to it. 

Unfortunately, I’m inclined to think the latter. As I’ve mentioned, my BMI is 15, meaning I am HORRIBLE at eating properly and taking care of myself(at first out of broke-ness, now out of habit). I also don’t like talking to people at all in real life, and find I have no intentions of making friends in person.

Oh, right, should mention I have trust issues that reach the molten core of the earth. Don’t remember much of my childhood before I was, like 12ish, and absolutely none before I was 8, so it’s gotta be pretty rough if I just straight blocked it out. 

I’m rambling. Basically, I’ve grown completely apathetic. I call myself an optimistic nihilist. I don’t currently feel the feeling of depression, yet i have a feeling she’s still hangin around. 

Should mention I have very little intentions of going to a therapist, and because of my fun little time with a bunch of hard drugs I am against taking prescription medication.

I’ve been in a relationship for 4.5 years and sometimes I don’t know if I’m actually happy or if I’m self sabatoging because I don’t feel that I’m worthy. I’ve done that in every relationship I’ve been in....I’ve always gotten along great with platonic friends but once it turns into a relationship where I feel vulnerable or that I might get hurt I turn kind of crazy. And looking back I recognize that. Now that I’m with someone in a good relationship heading towards marriage, I recognize that I have the same patterns from past relationships where I self destructed because my brain is stupid and I created situations that were not real and reacted to them and then it just, fell apart. I’m starting to do that...getting anxious and unhappy...I don’t know. I think I’m attracted to the same sex as well, which would explain when I was always uncomfortable around other girls when I was a child and never really had girl friends. I drunkenly tried to kiss one of my girl friends in college in a bar bathroom. We were both drunk, she was bisexual and was kind of into one of the other girls in our group of friends. I tried to kiss her and she avoided it. I was so shocked and embarrassed, I didn’t know what to do. I always hooked up with guys and never really had a “type” but I think trying to take that risk and being rejected messed with me. I never made a move on a girl again. And I seem to been keenly aware when other girls flirt with me. My boyfriend laughs about it, but idk. I just needed to get that out, I’ve actually never “said” that to anyone.

136,"For context I have clinical depression, clinical anxiety, Sensory Processing Disorder

I feel like I constantly have chest discomfort. I’m not even sure if discomfort is the right word, it’s almost like an uncomfortable awareness, like when you realize you’re breathing and you manually breath (if that makes any sense). The area of this feeling is my upper chest going down in between my breasts, sort of an inverted triangle. 

I really don’t think it’s a physical problem since EKGs have not shown any issues, and again it’s not really pain it’s moreso an awareness/ mild discomfort. 

I often find myself putting pressure on my chest with my hand, or hugging something like a pillow or blanket to make it feel better. I’ve been told that this could be a symptom of my anxiety and I guess it’s heightened when I’m anxious but it’s a pretty consistent feeling even when I’m not consciously anxious. Like it’s not bothering me 24/7 only when I become aware of it. I think it could have to do partly with my Sensory Processing Disorder because I’m really sensitive to tactile information (especially when it comes to clothing). Like another area that gives me constant discomfort is being aware that my toes are touching which is similar to the feeling in my chest.

I also notice that if I ever forget to take my meds this chest discomfort increases and I feel compelled to curl up in a ball/tightly hug my pillow. This chest feeling increases when I’m feeling depressed and back before I was on the medication I am now on this was a lot worse. Nowadays because of my meds my depression (at least the physical symptoms) are gone while my anxiety is better than it was but still challengingly.  I just don’t understand what’s causing this.

Am I the only person who feels this way? I just don’t know what to do, or if there is anything I can do besides try to distract myself.",16Jun2019,3

138,"I don't know how I survived. I laced a belt to my neck, and it was tied to a rope. Then I jumped off a chair. I stopped breathing and quickly got unconscious.

All I know is that the belt broke, I felt to the ground and when I got conscious of what I was happening, I was like.. running through my room jumping over anything that was in front of me. I started laughing uncontrolablly. And woke up my parents.

Now my face is a bit purple, full of red dots, one of my eyes is bloodshot, my neck is fucked up and hurts too much, and I am spitting blood. Going to the hospital now with my parents. Wish me luck.",16Jun2019,1
139,"In short: Mid 20s male. I was quite healthy until around 16, and then both mental and physical health went downhill in various ways(immune, cardiovascular, nervous system, endocrine system, mental health). The mental issues are the most pressing, but the medical system where I live is not really interested in underlying causes or preventative medicine, just treating symptoms. I'm trying to determine which types of specialists I need to see to deal with any underlying issues before they get worse, as treating the symptoms seems unsustainable in the long-term.

Details: - Until 16ish, no health issues besides chronic atypical migraines(20-25days/month), tourettes, and appendicitis

    From 12-18 I consumed 2-3 grams of ibuprofen 20-25 days/month

    Around 18 there was a raw sewage backup in our basement. I got pneumonia, COPD, and got put on a beclomethasone inhaler for the next two years

    Shortly after the pneumonia, I developed intense fatigue, an essential tremor, high BP and high HR. Bloodtests showed subclinical hypothyroidism and low testosterone, got put on TRT

Between then and now, I developed the following symptoms:

Mental: Fatigue, Depression, Anxiety, Apathy, ADHD

Physical: Drastic increase in allergies(dust, feathers, cats, legumes, wheat, nuts, eggs, possibly others), a period of a couple years of excessive sweating followed by a near complete cessation of sweating, temperature regulation issues(near constantly hot to the touch), occasionally my feet and hands become dark red/hot/itchy and blanch when touched. I also had shingles. In addition to that, eating makes both physical and mental symptoms worse, even after implementing an elimination diet.

So in summary, where I'm currently at:

Mental Health: Apathy, Depression, Anxiety, Fatigue, ADHD Physical Health: High BP+HR, High Cholesterol, Significant Allergies, Post-Herpetic Neuropathy, No Sweat, Bad Temperature Regulation, Extremity Swelling/Blanching, and eating makes everything worse.

I do all of the standard behavioral interventions: meticulously tracked and healthy diet, frequent exercise, meditation, sleep hygiene, etc. These interventions are only possible due to being on amphetamines and an SSRI.

Medication partially helps with the mental health issues(Dexedrine, Adderall, Prozac). I'm worried that it's not sustainable and that I'm just masking underlying issues. The primary reasons for my concern are the following:

    2-3g/day of ibuprofen seems like it has to be awful for my gut health and microbiota, and I've also been on antibiotics 10+ times in the last 8 years. I imagine that such excessive use of a COX inhibitor may have downstream hormonal effects as well?

    Majority of issues didn't show up until after getting pneumonia and being put on beclomethasone. I'm worried that by treating the symptoms, I'm ignoring potential underlying issues(e.g. broader endocrine issues, immune issues, maybe some sort of viral/bacterial/fungal/parasitic infection from the sewage backup).

    Despite being on TRT, doctors don't seem interested in things like HCG therapy. Doesn't TRT lead to HPG axis suppression, which could theoretically lead to issues with e.g. cholesterol, dopamine, adrenals, etc?

    I have strong family history of Multiple Sclerosis, Autoimmune/Thyroid Disease, and Alzheimers. My symptoms seem to overlap with the issues in those diseases, and if I can do something to reduce my risk, I'd like to.

So the question is, what sort of specialists should I get referrals to? I'm thinking maybe an endo and an immunologist? Is there anything else worth considering? Would I have better luck just hiring a private doctor who can deal with things in a way that a socialized medical system can't?(e.g. preventative medicine, treating the body as a unified system rather than isolated symptoms).

Thanks for reading, really appreciate any advice.",16Jun2019,1
140,"I posted this on r/offmychest and didn't get any response so I figure I give it a second chance here.

Two years ago I had a psychosis and for the last two years I've been recovering from this experience. I was diagnosed with a post-psychotic depression among with that I didn't take my medication regularly because I didn't want to accept my diagnosis. This lead to that the rehabilitation process was prolonged and is why it has taken two years to recover. 

During my psychosis I managed to scare away my friends and family because of my reckless behaviour. I borrowed a hefty amount from them and spent it on mostly cigarettes, alcohol and food. I hardly never slept, was hearing voices and having conversations with myself. I started arguments and screamed at people for no good reasons. This went on for three months and I lost several jobs and soon after I was hospitalised against my will for my condition.

Now two years later I live alone, having isolated myself from my friends and family. I am living off social security and are soon able to go back and look for employment. 

The problem is that I still, even after two years, can't move on with my life. And I don't want to go through life repeating what happened over and over in my head. I guess what I  am saying is that I  feel stuck and I don't want this to be the end for me.",16Jun2019,1
141,"This is really stupid, but i always doubt the feelings I'm , well, feeling. Eg, I don't know if this 'joy' I'm feeling is actually joy, like how can I be sure that, that is what it's meant to feel like, it was never explained i was just given the word and people assumed that i would recognise a certain feeling as being 'joy' 

I just don't know what I feel, most of the time I cant actually tell what emotion it is that I'm experiencing and I'm constantly second guessing it or there are even days where I don't know what I am feeling, it's like nothing, I'm just there, like a stain in a t-shirt just existing",16Jun2019,4
142,"For as long as I can remember, I have had this gnawing feeling of self hatred in my life. When I get frustrated with anything,I take it out on myself,like that accomplishes anything. For the past twenty years of my life, I could never really get to a point where I actually could love myself. I just can’t shake this very bad feeling of worthlessness. I’ve tried to put myself in a mindset like I would treat anyone else except me, but that just adds to the misery of the thought process.

I guess because I don’t know how to love myself like I do those around me, I’m stuck in a perpetual cycle of self worth issues that, I fear I may never get out of.",16Jun2019,1
143,"I have recently been diagnosed at bipolar (23M) and have always had thoughts that I was special, would save the world/help everyone else, and had a considerable sense for spirituality.

After realizing that these are functions of bipolar, I'm having a slight identity crisis because a lot of what I thought was unique is, intact, related to bipolar symptoms.

Should I be feeding into the delusions of grandeur &amp; savior complex, thinking that there may be some good to come out of it? Or is that unhealthy and I need to deny this symptom, knowing that it's a cognitive distortion? Thanks in advance for any insights!",16Jun2019,1

145,"I have struggled with chronic depression, generalized anxiety and bipolar disorder for 9 years now. I've been prescribed a variety of different medications and seen multiple therapists/psychologists/psychiatrists. I am high-functioning on the outside but these feelings are crippling on the inside. I'm not completely giving up hope — but are some people just doomed to experience these issues for their entire lives?",16Jun2019,1
146,Does anyone else feel that they are constantly in their own heads? Recently I have gotten to the point where I really struggle to control my own thoughts and will suddenly have a thought pop into my head without any clue how it go there. It will have almost no relation to my life or interests. But often the thoughts are troubling or will have me truly questioning my existence. I often times feel that I run into these coincidences and it makes me feel like my life is some sort of simulation or I am going crazy. I really struggle with this although I somehow still manage to live a high functioning lifestyle...I also feel as though my memory has gone to relative shit.,16Jun2019,2
