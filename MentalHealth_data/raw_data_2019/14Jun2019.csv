1,"I’ve been experiencing the type of anxiety where I’m obsessing over mistakes I made several year ago when I was younger and stupid/ essentially poor life decisions that I regret over and over 24/7 and can’t get out of this endless loop. I literally feel guilty for things I did when I was 18 and now I’m about to turn 23. I’ve quit coffee and eat a balanced diet and exercise 4x a week—- none of this has helped. Exercise I usually feel good during and right after but about 30 mins after exercising I feel anxiety creep back up on me. It always feels like I’m never present and the anxiety runs in the background.

I’m pretty sure I have a porn addiction because unlike most men I lack a refractory period. First thing I do when i wake up is jerk off 3-5 In a row. And I do the same before I go to bed/ I can’t sleep without masturbating. Had anyone noticed or think my anxiety could be linked to porn messing up my dopamine levels or something? I usually feel okay right after masturbating and then anxiety hits me like a Truck. Exercising also makes me incredibly horny as well and tempts me to want to jerk off. But the anxiety is killing me now...",14Jun2019,0

3,"I’ve struggled with depressive episodes and anxiety over the past few years, I take my medicine and see my therapist weekly, I show up to work everyday, and I try to run a few days a week for physical activity. Even with all of this I’ve slipped back into a depressed state this past week and honestly I just don’t care about getting better. I know that when I’m depressed I don’t really care about anything, but I have no urge to get better right now. My family tells me I need to push myself to get up and do things that I know will help me and I just plain old don’t want to. It’s not even that I feel like I can’t do it or I don’t have the energy to do it...I just don’t want to. Is this the depression talking, or something in myself that I need to work on?",14Jun2019,1

As the title states, my old friend DM'ed me this morning, and now I'm crying again at his newest DM.

I don't know what he's doing, but it's stressing me out. I think he may be testing me to see if I'd still be a good friend. Either way, it's hurting me.

But that's not the biggest thing that happened to me this month. The biggest thing that happened to me was that I reported my abuser to the FBI.

I was sexually manipulated and gaslit for nudes by a 36 year old man from when he was 33 and I was 14, to when he was 36 and I was 17.

It took me a week or two to gather the courage to do so after realizing how sexually dependent on him I was.

I've moved on from that since and I'm waiting for him to be arrested. I even reported him to his step-mother and am working on finding his sister and father so I can tell them about his behavior.

Either way, it's been an eventful past few months. I just hope I can make it through summer.",14Jun2019,1

6,"I have noticed this for quite a bit now, but this is when I seriously need answers. 

I am using an alt by the way.

A few months ago, my uncle died. I did not know him that well but the rest of my family was upset. I did not have any sad reaction to the family being upset.

Now this is the part where it’s scaring me. A couple weeks ago, our dog died. The entire family is devastated, except me. I don’t feel sad, upset, angry, etc. I just have that “Oh he died” reaction.

7,"So, hi, I'm 16 and am pretty sure I'm not as trans as I thought, so, this is gonna be long, be ready.
When I was 10-11, it first started. The dysphoria, the feeling of unwanting in my own body, it was just there. So, as I grew, it became a stronger, more tolling thing, so I took off to the internet. 
Transgender described it. The dysphoria, the disgust in my body, the unease, everything pieced together. I first came out at 13, it was to my sister and grandma. They played it off, then I told my Mom and Dad a few months later (did NOT go well)
So, fast forward 2 years, I lose 50lbs (I was overweight, got down to and currently am 125lbs), and my feelings have not changed. I'm binding with ace, stealing my brothers clothing, taking their hygiene products, etc. 2 of my sisters are accepting of me and call me my ""new name"" whenever ears aren't listening. But, there was something that was off. Why don't I hate being called my deadname? Or female pronouns? Or when my Mom calls me by my sisters name? When my sister ""misgender"" me?
It wasn't adding up and I was getting so frustrated. I should hate it. I shouldn't be okay with it. So, a bit before I turned 16, I cut contact with my social group (I explained that I needed to do something personal, on my own) and I started writing.
I thought that if I wrote about the bad stuff, the mean things in my life, I'll find the answer. I wrote and wrote. I wrote about my abuse. I wrote about my self harm. I wrote about my bullying. I wrote about my crumbled friendships. I wrote about my anxiety. I wrote about my anorexia for goodness sake. But, it didn't come out.
So, balling my insecurities to the back of my head, I wrote what made my stomach curl. What makes my thoughts run, what makes me want to cry hysterically, what makes me so embarrassed to even think of.
I wrote about my sexual harassment.
Then, after that, it stayed on my mind for weeks. Of course, my thoughts to my possible answer were all negative.
But it fit. And it took me 3 damn year for me to realize this. It took me so fuxking long to understand this, to accept this. 
And it hurts.
I feel like I've manipulated the people I love. I feel like a liar and a dirty scum. I can't fathom an excuse for what I've done. But I'm scared of what would happen if I told my sisters what I really feel. I'm scared to even mention the events that made me like this. I want to get it out, to let them know, but it feels so embarrassing to even talk to myself about. 
I don't know what to do.",14Jun2019,2
8,"Hello all. I’m posting this on a throwaway just in case. 

I’ve been contemplating suicide for years now, but I’ve never really followed through with it, or taken the steps to do so. It isn’t because I’m alone, people hate me, depression or anxiety is getting to me etc. As a matter of fact my life is great. I feel suicidal because of the fact that I don’t feel like I belong in this world. I feel like I’m living a fake life. It seems like I should be living a different one. I don’t feel like me. Has anyone else felt the same way and how do you cope?

I seemed to have entered a state where its difficult for me to get up and get food from the store.

Meanwhile, I feel this strange stress to go do something, to fix my situation. I feel frustrated, a warm agitation reminiscent somehow of what it may feel like to have a warm slice of pizza rubbed all over my face. Though not the first time I've felt this, I have no idea what I'm supposed to fucking do about it. 

Writing this doesn't even feel that relieving right now. I have so much shit to do or that I should be doing yet don't know where to start. Its late afternoon now, but it feels like I jetted here from fucking 12pm.

 Also, and this is a thing that's been bothering, I can't FUCKING DECIDE what to do next with my goals. I don't even know that I will feel better and even though I say I'm planning to become an engineer, I honestly can't decide what to do with my creative side.

  
I had an in-take with a therapist where I forgot to mention that I have trouble talking to girls and that my indecisiveness with women is causing me to avoid someone at work. Also, that's not the only situation I avoid certain people. I want to get that new goddamn position at work soon so I don't have these same awkward encounters where I'm busy. I have to sign up for classes I have to try and find some event that will hopefully teach me to be an actually functioning straight male I have to speak with my apartment manager and its too late I have to clean my apartment before they inspect I have to figure out what I'm doing for fathers day I have to get in contact with my classmates  I need to find something to do in my spare time so I don't get... well.

Anyway, I can't stand it.  I don't know what to do with my time. I keep fucking it up. Every day just passes and I'm counting down the days until my next birthday and have been doing so since the beginning of my last goddamn birthday. Everything is just slipping away and I can't stand it. I'm bored, but I use the computer too much and have no money. I have no one to talk to. I have nothing to really do and yet I have everything to do.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just going to post this and I guess try to fucking fill in my planner with lists of things to do or something after I post this, but I don't even know that's going to help.

My mom will get mad when I'm joking around. They hate the fact that I perfere to play video games because I'm not with the family but video games, school and work is how I escape them and I'm so much happier even if I hate the work I do I just prefer it over being around my parents. Honestly I'm just a piece of sh*t. I'm not there perfect child who would be around the family, do what ever they say, and I can't talk to them about my problems because they would probily just say things like "" have I been a bad parent"" and they don't believe in mental illnesses.

She told me I wasn’t toxic today, which I was shocked by because I’ve always been worried that I was toxic. I was like “you’re just saying that because you’re my therapist” and she said “no, I’ve met toxic people, I’ve told clients they are toxic. You’re not toxic [my name]”.

So I work in project management as an administrative coordinator. Basically I organize everything and keep everything flowing to the right people so everyone can do their job swiftly. My small project management department has been talking about getting a management software that would replace using excel to keep track of the work queue. That’s all the software would do. This has been in talks for months. 
Today I get a call from my boss (she works from home) saying that the software is finally here but HR says that because we now have the software, we don’t need me anymore. That’s not how that works. I was suppose to run the software and STILL keep everything running smoothly, especially with the transfer of all of our files and projects in the beginning. But I lost my job anyway. 

This hits me hard. I don’t feel like doing anything anymore. I cried for hours in my office. I feel useless. I feel like I can’t do anything right. I’m so disposable no matter where I go.

2 years ago today, I lost someone near and dear to my heart. He was my first friend I ever made in college and our home state pride ran deep, even miles away in New York. I had no idea he was dealing with depression. I was so focused on the joy he brought to my life that I didn’t see the shadow behind the light. I keep a picture of him around me so I can see his beautiful smile. I didn’t know him for too long, but I knew him long enough to love him. 

I haven’t been the most mentally stable in these past two years for various reasons, (I deal with depression and anxiety) but for some reason, seeing his face makes me want to push on. There are surely days when I just want to see him again and hear him laugh one more time, but a part of me feels like he wouldn’t be happy to see me. I don’t know what was going through his head in his last moments before he took his life, but all I know is I miss him so much. I feel his presence from time to time, but I just miss him so much. We were supposed to graduate together next May. With all of these milestones coming up, the pain hasn’t exactly eased. I would say I wish he was here, but that would be selfish. I have no idea what was going through his mind and how he truly felt. I just hope that wherever he is, he is happy and he knows that I love him.",14Jun2019,6

So I go up to the hospital to see him thinking everything is fine and hes awake and happy but that wasnt the case.

He coded but they got him back, he has been in a coma ever since. They need to replace a valve in his heart and are going to do that tomorrow now the thing is, is he has an infection so they're not overly confident he will come out of this alive. I've never lost anyone close to me before and I'm not talking this well. I can't get the look of his fear out of my face.

This piece of advice is a very case by case thing but whenever I’m anxious I tend to fidget a lot with my hands which gets the jingling sound going. My response is usually “shut the fuck up!” or “this is so annoying!” and it gets me out of my head for a split second. Despite not being long, the moment of focusing on what’s around me is enough time for the panic to come down a little.

31,"So, a month ago, I went to the pharmacy and picked up Prescription #1. Nothing out of the ordinary. Eight days later, I go to pick up Prescription #2 and for some reason I also got another Prescription #1 along with the Prescription #2... The insurance covered it and everything. So there I was, with two prescriptions for the same medication, basically 7ish weeks worth of medication. All covered by my insurance. It was a wtf moment, but I wasn't going to say no to almost two month's worth.

Today I was trying to figure out how many refills I have left before I study abroad. Well, apparently I have one more refill (that I can fill in about a week and a half) that I technically wouldn't need, because I already have medication for this month. So when I go pick it up, I will have two month's of medication at my disposal, AGAIN. 

Literally, I've been thinking about this for the last hour and a half trying to figure this shit out. Turns out, during finals, I fucked up my medication and started missing days (I have terrible memory around that time). So when my psychiatrist sent another prescription, it was already filled, waiting for me, even though I had another eight days worth of medication. So I didn't bother picking it up.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where it gets interesting. I checked my insurance. Turns out, when I didn't pick it up when my psychiatrist sent the prescription, the pharmacy sent the insurance back it's money, since I wouldn't be picking it up. So officially in the eyes of the insurance, I didn't have the Prescription #1 filled out. BUT, the pharmacy didn't catch that. They SOLD IT TO ME ANYWAY with my insurance ""covering it"". Which is why the second time I went and filled it out, the insurance covered it, because they thought that this was my first prescription of the month. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I asked the pharmacist about the dates that I filled them out and picked them up. He eventually got upset and frustated at me because he ""didn't see what was so confusing about this"" XD.

I'm not entirely sure what to do with this information. To be honest, this is ALL MY OWN SLEUTHING. I can literally be wrong. All I know is that I got a month's worth of medication right now, and I have one more refill coming up soon.",14Jun2019,2

Title really says it all, I feel like a failure. It's like I'm untethered and by being untethered I think I am more of a hinderance to those around me than a help which means every situation in which a failure takes place I am only spiralling deeper.

It's not the best mental space for someone with ADD, mild anxiety, and depression. I feel angry when alone (angry at myself), and I feel as though I am bending as far as I can without breaking.

Every single meal i eat i worry that i just gained a pound. I freak out thinking of calories and sugar contents in everything and because of that sometimes i just dont eat like i wont eat dinner or breakfast or ill fast until i get shaky which doesnt last long since the meds lower my sugar... i feel like im losing control, like theres no one i can talk to that would understand.

37,"I joined Reddit for the primary reason of connecting with like minded Taylor Swift fans. I knew about its reputation previously as a cespool of internet hate and misogynist bullies, but thought my particular fandoms would be free of such issues.

But ever since joining I feel really low, and like the connection I'm craving is coming at the cost of my mental health. Someone called me a c-word on a comment I made recently, and a bunch of people sort of come at me whenever I'm just making slight observations or giving a little bit of pushback.

I don't see myself as rude or abrasive, but sometimes I can be a little curt.

I also joined a separate forum for discussing youtubers (gossipguru) and find that particular audience to be aggressively catty. I've quit checking in on them as much, because of the negativity that thrives over there, and because I'm a little bit older than the primary demographic (teens and college kids)

the reason I sought out Reddit and GuruGossip is because I just moved to a new city and I don't have a lot of friends. I primarily work from home, and find myself lonely with large swathes of free time. I crave human interaction and companionship, but have yet to really connect with people in my area. I felt like forums would be a good place to at least interact with other people, even if it wasn't face to face, but now I'm really questioning this decision.

I want to stop, but I'm also kind of addicted to what little connection I have on these types of forums. And no matter what I do - logging out, deleting the app, removing the history, blocking the site - I find myself unblocking it and coming back.

 I managed to delete all of my social media in 2017 for similar reasons - feeling that the constant need for third party validation, chasing likes, and trying to fit in a box, was stifling my creativity and impacting my mental health in a negative way. But deleting social media was somehow easier than limiting my time on sites like Guru Gossip or Reddit.

So I’m all of the time sad and anxious (I know what this is, it’s my depression and most people on my moms side has it) but then there is a layer of feeling like am dreaming and like I’m tired all of the time. Like I’m high, but I don’t smoke weed or do any drug.

41,For the last 6 months I've had daily suicidal episodes that can range from contemplating to having repeating images of me killing myself almost in a loop. I have no one that really understands what I'm going through and I hide it the best I can. The only time I don't have these thoughts is when I'm high and even then when I'm crashing from a high it can be pretty bad.

42,"Forgive me if I word it weirdly. It’s hard to get out some thoughts without sounding batshit insane.


For about the past five years, my mental well being has significantly worsened. It started off small, just me butting heads with my mom on certain issues, or me being a little self conscious about my weight, you know, the little stuff. It grew into more serious things like having complete arguments and screaming matches in public with my mom, and my self consciousness evolved into dysmorphia (not to be confused with dysphoria). 

I’ve had issues with my mom before. She’s a narcissistic, abusive asshole who doesn’t seem to consider anything but what she wants. I’m an ice skater, and she constantly pushes me to do shit that I don’t want to do with my skating. It’s been so bad the past couple years that I’ve considered quitting so that I wouldn’t have to deal with it.

Unrelated to just the ice skating, there are certain things that just piss me off to no end. Stuff like constantly hovering over my shoulder for unimportant things, or trying to get anyone around us into taking her side over an argument that I clearly was in the right of. She knows how to piss me off, and I’m not an impatient person. She riles me up and she uses my reaction to play victim. One time I made a passing comment after a fight and she full on tried to assault me. Again, I don’t want to instigate anything, so I held her off me until my dad came by. 

My mom has been like this all my life, but I only realized it in my later years as I became more my own person. As I grew older, it became more and more apparent how she pushed my dad or anyone with significance out of my life. She became the one who decided what I did or did not do, and since at the time, I was homeschooled, which meant she had that much more control over me. My dad had little to no standing in my life other than a money provider, which she mooched off of constantly before she got a job, and vague father figure. My dad is a genuinely good person, which begs the question why he would stick around for so long.

My brothers are older than me by a good margin, so when they moved out, my mom point blank said that the only reason why my parents weren’t getting a divorce was so that they could support skating (which keep in mind, was a hobby I outgrew, in favor for more popular sports that I could make friends with, like volleyball or field hockey). So not great mindset after my whole life of that.

Over the course of time, I disassociated consistently. I was more a husk of my formerly extroverted self than a real personality. I was emotionally distanced a lot of the time, and if I didn’t feel empty, I felt irritable or sad. I think I started realizing I had issues when I cried every night to my mom screaming at my dad about one thing or another.

Jump to now. I freely admit I struggle in school. Sometimes I don’t understand or retain information, and I’m hesitant to ask for help, mainly because my family has a track record of being unreliable. I begin figuring out that some of my issues may be motivation and stress, and once I rule out certain things that trigger those reactions, I find it’s different.

I do research about what I feel, I ask friends who deal with certain mental disorders (typically those who have one), and I make a case for myself. I don’t claim to have anything without a professional opinion, but I come to the conclusion that it’s an at least mild form of depression. I even have a boyfriend diagnosed with clinical depression, and I’ve had him confirm some of my suspicions. Still, unless I have absolute proof, I don’t want to make assumptions.

Fairly recently, like a few months ago, I go to my mom and I tell her that I’ve been having issues for a while. I tell her what I think I may have, and that I want to see a medical professional about it. She ignored me. The next day, she comes back with several useless things like a “grow your own herbs” flower pot kit saying I can make tea out of it to help my stress. So great, the only thing she got out of that was stress.

A month later, she tells me she wants me tested for a learning disability. Both of my brothers along with a couple other family members have autism, but since they’re all so high functioning, it wouldn’t have much of an affect on us. I’m my mothers only child without autism, or any diagnosed mental issue or disability so far. But she wants me tested for a learning disability, which probably would’ve come out much sooner if that was the case, in my opinion. I wouldn’t know though.

I have a teacher in school who I tell everything. All the thoughts in my head and everything that goes on in my life. That teacher is the mom I wish I had. She’s an overall amazing person, and I wish I saw her more often than every school year. One day, she goes to the counselor, and tells the counselor my thoughts, despite my deliberate efforts to avoid the counselor (as he is at best incompetent). The counselor calls me in from one of my classes to talk about it, and I had a full breakdown in front of him. I don’t usually break down in front of people, but I couldn’t control it. After we talk for a while, he says whatever I’m feeling is real, but I’m going to have to talk to the school psychologist about it later on. Unfortunately, this is towards the end of the school year, and as time goes on, the psychologist doesn’t call me in. Eventually, exam week arrives, and I only have one exam, so I only go for one day out of the week. After that week ends, school is over for the year. Which means I’m no better off than when I started. Best case scenario, I either talk to the psychologist next year after three months of nothing helping me, or my boyfriend takes me to see a licensed psychologist during the summer regarding my problems.

TL;DR: mental health is a huge issue in my life and I don’t know what to do about it.

43,"I'm 16 years old. And I'm in highschool however I will not graduate 9th grade again yes I said again because I already got left back once. But it's because I have... Emotional and mental problems that seem to make me not be able to function properly. But why? And what's wrong with me? For example when I go to school and someone says or does something I don't like I feel like pouncing on them and punching them, and I always feel like screaming and wanting to get out of school asap. It's serious, why is this happening to me? I also space out and kind of forget about reality and the situation around me. Does anyone know what this is? And I don't even wanna go to school tomorrow which is the last day. I Wanna cry and scream out of anger and frustration and I don't know why. I'm not getting bullied, and I haven't done much school work to stress myself out.

Oh and by the way I've tried therapy and a pyscatrist but the clinic I went to had low payment so I had to change therapists and pyscatrists because they all left to a different clinic. And now I left as well and I'm waiting to be registered in  new clinic so please leave therapy shit out because I'm working on that but struggling to get a decent one. 

So for now I have to rely on myself to get better until I'm able to get registered.

But it feels like I’m not me, like i have memories from when I was kid but I feels like I have someone else’s memories..someone else’s body. I look at pictures and I think, that was me? Bc obviously it WAS me, but not...me? I honestly don’t know how to say what it’s like, what this really feels like, maybe like going kinda crazy? I am transgender so you would think, it’s just me not associating with being a girl or having a female body, which yeah maybe it is..but it’s not like that..or at least not entirely. I don’t know. It’s like having a person stuck in my head, and they’re really far back so I can nearly hear them but they’re there, and I can remember what they remember but it’s kinda foggy bc they’re so far back? My mom used to think I have some sort of personality disorder but when I went to therapy the person never really asked about it and I was too scared of being called crazy to talk about it. I guess I missed my shot. Also sometimes it feels like I’m not here, like I’m watching everything from a camera or something. Like I’m here but I’m split in two so the other part is somewhere else? Ugh idk. Idk. Idk. Everything’s just so UGH. I feel crazy sometimes honestly. It’s scary tho. I try to just ignore everything but I want to be able to describe these feeling better. It’s hard to talk about things that make you feel crazy face to face so I thought this would be easier...idk..just maybe someone else would understand my ranting. Sorry.",14Jun2019,1
46,"6 months ago my cat sashimi passed away. I’m very young, so she was with me my entire life. I volunteer at a petsmart in the cat area. Two cats reminded me so much of her. One of them had the same pattern and the other leaned all her weight on to my hand like sashimi did. I took care of the same cats last week. I almost had a panic attack for no reason while I was petting one of the cats. I feel like they would look like her if she was healthy. Sashimi was extremely underweight, but gave me all of her love. I didn’t get to see her when she passed away since I moved to NM with my mom while my dad stayed in NY with 2 out of 5 of our cats. We now only have 4 cats. Today when I was taking care of the petsmart cats I kept having to stop myself from crying. I sat in the car crying for about 20 minutes after my mom left it. I’ve been home for about 3 hours and I keep bursting into tears. I haven’t thought about her in months. I want to stay by my cats but they make me so sad because I know I won’t have sashimi ever again. Tomorrow I will be going to NY to visit my dad. I haven’t been there after sashimi passed away. So I know I’m going to be extremely lonely, since whenever I was there and I couldn’t sleep I would give her milk and snuggle with her. One of our cats, Gray Cat, will be there which feels even worse, even though I love him. I’m posting this here since I’m still getting diagnosed for mental disorders, most likely anxiety, depression and ADHD. At least that’s what my therapist thinks. I keep crying while writing this. I don’t know why o decided to write this. I guess I just needed to get my feelings down.",14Jun2019,2

51,"Hello, everyone, I've been feeling weird and I don't know why and how to stop it so I'm looking for advice if anyone has any. I grew up in an unsupported family, My mom and dad both died when I was young so I was living with my aunt. Throughout my childhood I was alone no one in my family would try and spend time with me and I missed out on the important emotional support a kid should receive.  I've learned how to hide my feeling behind a happy persona that I feel isn't me, but since I've been doing it so long I don't know the actual me. I felt like being depressed or complaining around or to people would just bring them down too. I spent most of my childhood on Youtube because that was the only ""support/positive human interaction"" I could get. Because my family was so standoffish I tried to create my self in the way I see Fit. I took morals from different content creators and try and mold myself around the person I think would be the best me. So throughout my teen years, I was on youtube and had little interaction with classmates in HS. I've never had a GF or even dated because I don't understand how to do that, probably relating to me not having a mother figure in my life. I feel like I'm not the best I can be and I don't deserve someone if I'm not worth wanting. I fear someone feeling trapped and not able to go out and find the right person for them, someone who will treat them better then I could. I want to be something my significant other is proud to have and not ashamed to be around me. I've recently been going to therapy and she told me I might have to High of expectations of myself, but how could I ever be happy knowing I not good enough for the person I'm with. Recently, I've been hanging out with a friend from school and I see her in relationships and it makes me feel like a useless unwanted person. I'm not appealing to anyone and I can't blame them. Just knowing that she could find her happiness with someone else envies me. Another recent situation was I was at work and I have this little cat thing that waves its hand on my desk. I put in the window to get sunlight but my co-worker (Same girl as before) took it and put it on her desk. I don't know why but I really hurt me and I don't understand why this tiny plastic toy meant so much. so I put it on my desk and haven't taken it out. (P.s my depression stems from not having a mother figure and feeling alone and unloved when I was a child, currently, I don't have anyone to go to when I'm feeling down and it makes life really hard) (also this is missing other events from when I was young so this is kinda an overview of my life and current weird thing happing.) Any Advice or something would be greatly appreciated.",14Jun2019,2
52,"**TW: Mentions of suicide, blackmail of false allegations, emotional manipulation/abuse, gaslighting**

First time poster here, but I really had to get this off my chest before I had a full breakdown. It might be long, so there will be a TL;DR at the bottom. I'm changing all names, for privacy, and I don't know how many are on Reddit.

Some backstory to my ex-girlfriend, let's call her Julie. A semi-recent time ago, I was in a committed relationship with Julie. We took things too fast for the brief time we dated, and that was probably one of the biggest mistakes I could have ever made. We were both fairly young (I won't say how young, as I'm not comfortable sharing my age on the Internet), so there was a LOT of mistakes made on both our parts. Looking back now, there were a lot of warning signs of a toxic partner that didn't take too seriously, or even completely disregarded otherwise! We were both in a local community theatre production (it was *Rumors* by Neil Simon, great show). I was Cookie, she was the understudy to Claire. Due to us sharing a lot of common interests with our cast mates, and other people, we had a pretty tightly-knit friend group with a lot of common friends. She wasn't my first relationship, but she was the first I ever introduced to my parents, and they loved her, much to my delight. We live in a fairly conservative region of the US, so I was worried sick. We knew each other for about 5 months before we officially started dating, though we both harbored feelings for one another. We went to each other's out-of-show events, and went on dates pretty frequently, even though we were both incredibly busy individuals.

When it came for dates, however, is when I first picked up on something that just wasn't right. No matter how much we spent, I always paid for everything. Coffee, movies, concerts, shopping trips, you name it. I never brought it up to her, as I wanted to be the ""nice supportive girlfriend who pays every time because she's so sweet"" type. Next up was the isolation. If I was talking to any number of my friends (mutual or not), she'd always come up to me and try to pull me away from them, and I almost always said yes, except for conversations with directors, stage managers, etc. I didn't want to leave, I was just so madly in love with her. I still think that everyone noticed, but never said anything, they knew how happy we were (or at least, how happy Julie was), and just let it be. They'd come to my rescue later, and I can't thank them enough. She'd always use her depression, anxiety, or ""abusive past"" (which I later found out was almost completely fabricated) as a means to get out of things she didn't want to do, or as an excuse to behave terribly. When she made a mean comment about how one of my trans friends looked, and how he ""didn't pass, so was he really trans?"" and I got on to her about it, she'd say something along the lines of ""Sorry, I just got anxious because I thought you were checking him out"" or ""Babe I'm feeling really depressed right now can you bring me a \[expensive coffee\]?"" (She lived pretty far away at that time). That continued into the fallout.

Now, the breakup. I remember, it was the 19th of September, only 6 days before my birthday, and two before our date anniversary, as we had started dating on the 21st of another month. She has to leave rehearsal early for singing lessons, and today was one of those days. I noticed she was rather...complacent, let's say. She didn't talk to anyone, not really even me. I had been really busy, so when she pulls me out of the auditorium to talk with her before she left, I was thinking 'Great, I can talk to her about how she's been feeling today, and remind her that I'm here for her!' We go into the hall, and before I can get a word out, she just looks me dead in the eyes and says ""I'm breaking up with you. I'll tell you later."" and walked away. I was stood there in shock until I was sure she was out of eye and earshot, and I just sank to the floor, wedged in the corner where the vending machine and walls met, and cried. I cried so much, but tried to keep it quiet as to not alert anyone else. I kept thinking 'What did I do wrong? Why me? Why did it have to be so abrupt?' and all sorts of questions. I stopped crying and wiped my eyes before the stage manager came out to check on me, as I hadn't been in there for maybe 20 minutes. I talked to her and a few other great friends (who kept it secret, thank goodness) about what happened, and they promised they were there for me. 

Fast forward a couple days after the breakup, and me trying to talk to her a bit, with her being just really shut off, I decided to just let her be for a while before we talked again. I knew she did have a past of depression and anxiety, so I gave her the space she said she wanted to sort things out. Then, as I'm making dinner, I get a text from Julie I blocked her number, so I can't quote it word for word, but it was something along the lines of ""How the fuck could you do this to me? After everything, you sit here and spread awful lies about me because you're so immature you can't handle me taking time to myself?!"" Note, we were in the show groupchat, and on the day after, I had asked if I could talk to someone for a while, and that I needed to talk about my emotions. Not once did I mention her by name, or even bring up the topic of romance. It may have been my phrasing, which I get wasn't the clearest, but talking to the few people who said I could talk, I never once said anything negative about her. They had supported me giving her space to sort her personal issues out, including one of my best friends, let's call her Samira, who had been dating her girlfriend for 3 years or so. (They're still together and very happy and I love them). Naturally, I try to defend myself, saying that I never said anything negative about her, or spread any rumors about her, and that I said I wanted to talk because I wanted to get how I was feeling off my chest and not bottle it up. She wouldn't listen. The final text she sent me before the next incident happened was ""I loved you (my name), I really did, but what you're doing is unacceptable and rude and immature, and I'm glad I've taken my space."" It crushed me. Seeing that final D hurt me to my core.

Come the next day, at 10:32 P.M, I began writing my suicide note. I had contemplated doing it before I met her, but she had me so under her spell, I really began to think my life was absolutely pointless without her. That I, as a person, *needed* her to keep going on, to be successful. I had my bottle of anti-depressants next to me, and my razors. I never ended up doing anything that night, as I stopped myself half way through it and thought ""What the hell am I doing?"" I went to my parents, and we had a long talk about how I did matter, and that I didn't need her to survive, all the while they hammered in the same thing I heard so many times: Give her space, she'll come to you when she's ready.

And so I did. Eventually, people we knew but weren't really friends with started giving me these looks. The look of disgust. Eventually, the guy who played matchmaker for us, let's call him Zach. He contacted me and asked why Julie was crying to him about all the things I had said about her. I was confused to say the least, but only slightly surprised. We talked, and eventually settled things, he thankfully took both of our stories into consideration, and is one of my closest friends to this day. She had actually been telling a lot of people about things I had ""done"" ranging from spreading rumors (ironic) all the way to shaming my body/appearance/outing my sexuality to a lot of people. I had heard a conversation offhand where one person had said she was planning to accuse me of sexual assault/non-consensual sex and trying to force her to do sexual acts she wasn't comfortable with, but I cannot confirm the validity. Nothing came out of that, and I had guessed it was another lie, made up by someone. We had never done anything sexual in nature. Most we ever did was lightly make out, and there wasn't any touching at all.

I realized more and more, with the professional help I got, and help from friends and family, that what she was doing wasn't right. She eventually started cutting ties with mutual friends, saying they were also talking shit about her, or that she couldn't associate with them because they associated with me. When we finally got around to speaking, about a month later, she denied everything I said, kept throwing insults and accusations of gossip, and when I brought up things she had done, she'd deny everything. When I showed her physical proof of what she said, she kept saying that she ""wasn't thinking straight"" or ""didn't mean it like that"" which I can understand, but with her past of how she treated me, I had my doubts. We stopped talking after that, and she tried to DM me on Instagram on New Year's Eve. I didn't read her message. I just blocked all her accounts. 

Enter, my current girlfriend, let's call her Maria. I had known Maria for a lot longer than Julie, and about half a year after Julie and I's relationship fallout, I asked Maria out. To my surprise, she said yes. We've been very happy together, and everything was going perfect. But of course, nothing can be perfect, can it?

I should mention this, but Julie stole my first kiss. I look back in disgust and shame, but that's beside the point. When Maria and I had our first kiss, it was great. Then, I opened my eyes briefly, I think I had an eyelash stuck in my eye, and I saw Julie. I saw her glasses, her eyes glaring daggers at me. Confused and scared, I jumped back and began coughing. When I looked up, Maria was in shock, clearly hurt I pulled away like that. When she asked me what happened, I had just said I choked on something. I have a feeling she knew I wasn't being genuine, but she realized I wasn't in the right state to talk about it, and let it be. A week later, I finally told her why I pulled away. She listened to everything, handing me tissues while I cried. She wanted to put her arms around me, but wouldn't, mainly because I eventually pulled away again when I told her about how any physical contact we made romantically, I felt, saw, and heard Julie. I knew it wasn't her, but seeing her again just filled me with so much disgust, anger, and sadness I just pulled away out of instinct. She assured me so many times that she wasn't her, and that I didn't have to worry about her hurting me the way Julie did. I eventually tried to kiss her again, but I just couldn't bring myself to it. We still have very little physical contact to this day, and we both desperately want to hug each other and never let go, but I just can't.

I don't know why I'm feeling like this. I had gotten over her until this point. Now, almost every time I give Maria a kiss or a hug, I see Julie just glaring at me. Sometimes, it isn't that Maria's been replaced with Julie, but that I see her glare, her spreading rumors about me, or think about what she's said to and about me. I don't want to feel this way. I can barely express affection to my girlfriend without feeling  a mix shame, fear, disgust, anxiety, anger, depression, and paranoia. Maria has said time and time again that she's gonna be here for me, and that we'll get through this, and I believe her. But there's still that little voice saying on repeat like a record; ""She doesn't mean it. Nobody means any of the nice things they say about you."" I've tried blocking it out, but it always comes back. If she does mean what she says, I keep spiraling into a thought train of ""How long will she put up with all my baggage until she gets tired and leaves me, just like Julie?""

Nothing anyone says to me feels genuine anymore. I've lost the ability to tell the difference between a truth and a lie. What can I do to be sure the people I'm close to are genuine in their support? How can I stop thinking about Julie like this? I want to hug and love Maria so much, but I just can't bring myself to do anything without something about Julie running through my head and giving me doubts about not only our relationship, but the relationships between friends and even family. I don't *want* anything to be like this.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Ex-girlfriend emotionally manipulated me and those close to me, and spread rumors and accusations about me when she decided she was bored of me. My current girlfriend is supportive, but I can't be very physically affectionate to her because I keep seeing, hearing, or thinking about my ex. I don't know how to fix it.

Once again, I'm sorry for the length, but if you've made it this far, I can't thank you enough, random Reddit user. Reading my ramblings and insecurities, regardless if anyone can help really makes me feel not alone. Just sharing my story has already prevented a lot of things that could have happened had I kept it bottled up. Thank you, and have a good night.",14Jun2019,1

54,"I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for 17 years. I've seen more therapists than I can count, male and female, varying ages and locations and certifications. I've had a few that I liked, but I don't feel like anything they did helped me. I've had a few awful therapists. Most of them are just ok. 

Maybe I've misunderstood what a therapist is for. I've always gotten the impression they are supposed to actually *do* something for me, give me tools to manage my mental health, or something... but usually it ends up more like a casual chat. I don't want to just talk about why I'm annoyed at my medical bills this week, I want to talk about why I might be so depressed and what we're going to do about it. I don't want to talk about my upcoming vacation, I want them to help me be less depressed so I can enjoy my trip. I don't want to hear about how I'm very blunt and not very emotional and not a great conversationalist, because I already know that, I want them to tell me whether they can help me or not. 

Are there therapists out there who actually try techniques to help, or are they only meant to just talk? I've spent so much money I don't have on therapy and meds that don't work. Is it worth looking for yet another one? How do I find someone good for me?",14Jun2019,1
55,"Posted this on my Facebook wall and got no response from anyone. Since I’m the type of person who seeks multiple points of view, I want hear out what others think and maybe change my opinion. Also I’d like to point out that I am not against therapy. I think it’s effective and should be sought out. 

If people would also put in as much attention, importance and visibility to the act of “talking about your feelings” as much as they do with social justice issues we’d all be in a better place socially and as a humanity and maybe we’d have less emotionally wounded people, which is the root of many issues. Honesty goes a long way. Expression goes a long way. Healthy human emotional communication goes A LONG WAY. Also, it would save a lot of people time and money from going to a therapist to “heal”. We literally have created a world and a culture in which talking and being honest about your feelings is a such a hard thing to do, along with the acceptance of other peoples feelings, and It’s so bad that there is a psychiatric and mental health industry banking off of people’s hurt/ignored feelings and emotions. And y'all wanna claim yourselves socialist and socially conscious while your unhealthy emotional deflections and deflective behaviors feed into a capitalist industry for a service of “pay me to listen to your feelings and I’ll help you sort them out, but only as long as you pay me”, because your ex lovers, friends and family and even you have failed at providing humans a constructive, comfortable, emotionally aware and healthy space to do so. Therefore we have people who avoid emotional honesty who box up every single emotion until it eats them up inside and fucks with their psyche and now they have to pay someone to help them heal from their traumas, trust, attachment and communication issues. Great job everyone!!!",14Jun2019,1

57,"To give a little back story, I've been single for 2 years after ending a relationship of 3 years. Since my last relationship, I've been emotionally numb when it comes to trying to start a relationship. 2 months ago I started to talk to a girl and ended up catching feelings for the first time in years. We went on a few dates, things were going great and we both seemed to really enjoy the time we spent together. On Saturday morning she called me and told me shes completely cutting it off. Deleted me/unfollowed me on everything, and just stopped after calling me. I went right back into the emotional numbness I had after the break up 2 years ago and couldn't really feel anything.

The day that I got that call is a complete blur. I got wreckless and went to hook up with someone (a person I trust deeply) and got home to go to sleep. When I woke up, it dawned on me that i couldn't remember anything from the day before besides the phone call and that i went to the other girl's house to hook up (but cant picture anything that happened) I didnt eat or drink anything while I was out of my house, no drugs involved, nothing. It's like my mind completely shut off for the day. I've never had anything like that happen to me.

Is this a common thing even though it was non-traumatic emotional stress? Is it something that I should get help for if it's only ever happened this one time?",14Jun2019,1
58,"Okay so i don't post very often but here I go. 

Lately I've been extremely tired and stressed at work. A whole business buy out happened and important people keep on coming in the mornings so that means, me and the rest of the overnight crew have to get a lot more done each night. These past couple of days I've been extremely tired but I don't think its because lack of sleep. Even on my days off I've taking naps and such. But the tiredness continues. To make it a little bit worse is that I my eyes sting and sometimes I feel like I'm in a dreamlike state. This is kinda off topic, but sometimes at work when I listen to the music, I hear stuff thats out of place. 

Examples: A deep mans voice, or a part of the song that doesn't sound like part of the song.(if that makes sense)

I've been like this for a couple weeks and honestly I'm not sure what to do. Schizophrenia does run in my family and sometimes I wonder if I'm slowly developing it. I just know I feel off. I can't even really draw anymore or watch tv or YouTube without wanting to cry or getting a headache. 

Hopefully y'all can help me out. Thanks in advanced. I don't know what to do at this point.",14Jun2019,1
59,"I've gone through serious and mild bouts of depression for the past few years. I've learned which things generally keep me afloat
- exercise, diet, social interaction, hobbies, working towards goals,  meditation

Unfortunately, even sometimes when i'm doing everything 'right' I will still become depressed. Today is one of those days where I can feel the brain fog setting in, even after a nice long run. 

I generally just ignore this feeling of 'creeping depression' and try to power through my normal routines. But instead of subsiding, sometimes I just begin to feel more and more joyless - until I suddenly find myself unable to get out of bed a few weeks or months later. In addition, because I work freelance theres little to motivate me to get me out of bed once I have lost the internal motivation. 

I'd like to hear what you guys do when you can feel the start of a depressive cycle. Specific things if possible, not general habits. Going out to dinner with friends? Seeing your therapist? Even if its something i've listed that I do, i'm curious to hear what helps others.",14Jun2019,1

Hi! I’m 18, f, and have formal diagnoses of major depressive disorder, ocd, and generalized anxiety disorder. I also struggle with self harm and have since I was 13. I’m currently in my second year of treatment in dbt and I am medicated. Whatever.

Okay, so when I was a little kid, I was completely untreated and as a result I was very emotional and had a hard time making friends. I’m very different now, not necessarily better, but different. I generally have a pretty okay social life since starting treatment. I have my group of friends and I’m working on building a life worth living and all that crap.

Unfortunately, As dramatic as it sounds, i have yet to escape my childhood. Many people at my school haven’t spoken to me since elementary school, when I was the aforementioned unstable mess who cried over everything and couldn’t keep a friend. I can’t blame them.

However, I’ve had a problem where some people have been bothering me, asking if I’m going to shoot up/bomb the school. I know it’s a joke (for the most part), but it’s incredibly unnerving to know that is my reputation. It’s been going on like this for two months. People I know and used to trust are getting in on this bullying. I genuinely have no desire to hurt any of them, I simply want to stay in my lane until graduation. But as they talk more and more it makes me angry.

I know this sounds like I’m the next white lone wolf, but I promise, I don’t want to hurt anyone. If anything I’m mad at myself for expecting people to see me differently. Due to this, I’ve self harmed a ton recently. I feel awful. I don’t know what to do.

Idk if this is relevant but I’m a 5’5 145 lb girl. This isn’t a physical fear, any of these people could take me to the ground in three seconds. I know it is premeditated and fueled by rumors.

Tl:dr: people are “joking” that I’m going to shoot up my school despite me trying my best to move on and become better at dealing with my emotions. I’m becoming a genuine danger to myself. I’m sick of being the “dangerous mentally ill girl”. What do I do?",14Jun2019,1

When we started dating I was falling into my first major episode of depression, and it was really bad, I was addicted to Xanax and then taken to a psych ward after overdosing, when I left I felt like a new man and i do not want to return there ever again, she supported me through it and supported me to start bodybuilding and it helped me recovered exponentially, I was truly happy with her, now this problem of, me having relied on so much on her, it feels like I'm standing on one leg.

71,"I've had this thing for a few years, now. I think it's along the lines of existential dread, or melancholy, or some mixture of them. I don't think I'm depressed, but I have a general sense of apathy. It's not all the time. It happens for a little while, goes away, and then comes back. I was fine earlier today. A little bit ago it came back up, and I'm sick of not understanding what I'm feeling. 

I really don't know how to describe it in words. It's like, a fear of sleeping, because you want to be aware, and experiencing things. But when you are, you feel tired, disinterested. You think about how alone you are, how no one is around. All of the nothingness that you got done in the day. All of the people you didn't talk to.

It's also a fear of death, because like with sleep, you may not experience anything after it happens. You don't want to find out, and even though you're very young, you're terrified of everything that can happen to you. 

It's a creeping fear in the back of your mind thinking, ""none of my friends actually care about me. No one wants to hear me babble about any of this.""

It's just an imminent, looming feeling, that, like a storm, comes and goes. I feel great throughout much of the day, and I like to think I'm fairly optimistic. But I can't stop thinking about all of the harshness of reality whenever I fall into this.

It's this feeling I get. It's like an emotion that lasts for longer than it's welcome, yet I don't feel like changing my state. I can't explain it. It's the kind of thing that just makes you want to cry a bit, even though you don't have a point to it. And it is crying because of a general feeling of some mixture of sadness, worry, fear. Not crying from joy. It feels like pressure and negativity and a vacuum of nothingness, all at once. And I have no idea what it is, why it is, or if anyone even knows what I'm talking about. Every time I find something that sounds like it, I go down the rabbit hole, and it's not it.

72,"Hi I'm from the Philippines, So...I don't really know how to explain this without being cringey tbh, anyhow basically I went to my school's Psychologist a few months back.

Tbh I think I do have a mental issue tho I don't want to specify because that could be dangerous to myself as an individual.

I do want to go to therapy as my school psychologist says because I do think it could be really beneficial but at the same time I don't want to hurt my parents. They are the world to me and I don't want to hurt them in anyway, I tried talking about it to them but the next thing I knew my sister told me that my parents cried while I slept because of it.

73,"Hi, so, I'm a college student, and I was raised by very strict Asian parents. It was kind of pounded into my head that I would never be enough in numerous ways as a kid, but now I'm realizing how toxic it is. 

It never really affected me until facing the academic rigors of college. I study in a competitive engineering program, and I've found that my grades aren't that great. Fine. But it's like, when I take tests, I go into a ""panic mode""; I'm just unable to think clearly and solve these problems efficiently because of the chatter in my head. I thought this was normal for a bit, until I went into my ochem final two days ago, and wanted to break down crying while taking it. I kept thinking about how I was going to fail the class, how I'm a fraud and I don't deserve my place at the uni, my parents are right about me not being able to be a real STEM major or go to grad school, etc... 

As I was holding back tears, I was trying to get through the problems. Because of time constraints and general inefficiency, I left some problems sort of blank. My friends and I talked about the exam afterwards, and I found that what THEY found hard and unable to do, I was able to do. (So I'm competent?) But for what they found easy (and what I found easy later upon walking out of the testroom), I couldn't... formulate anything.

76,"This is a throwaway account as my so uses reddit and dont want them knowing.

A bit of background info, I am currently suffering from depression and anxiety I think, I'm not medicated as I've always just managed to get on with things. I'm married with 3 children and have a pretty good life in comparison to a lot of people.

But there have been a lot of things that have happened over the course of time that right now I feel it would be everyone's best interest that I left permanently.

Up until I met my SO 2 years ago I went from one abusive, toxic and violent relationship to the next, being convinced that the person wasnt like the next. For example an ex I have a child with stopped me seeing my daughter because i didn't want to be with them anymore as they were abusive, controlling, manipulative and wouldn't let me do anything. The ex partner I dated after them convinced me that they were different but then ended up exactly the same and even had me arrested for defending myself against them, they practically ruined my career as I had a pending conviction on my record that stopped me getting an internship at one of the biggest companies in the world. 

During this period I lost my grandmother who was the closest person to me as my family literally consisted of me, my mother, my grandparents. This broke me but I carried on as it hit my mother a lot harder so I learned to switch off to be there for her, now I can fortunately/unfortunately switch my emotions off and feel nothing to no-one. 

After escaping those experiences I was still hounded by both my exes and harassed continuously to the point of being stalked daily and threatened continuously leaving me with immense anxiety about living my life. 

Then my saving grace happened. I met my soon to be married partner. They had been through similar turmoil but still had a positive outlook and strong persistence to keep going, not to mention how insanely beautiful they are.

I fell in love pretty hard and quick with them and they did too (I hope) we had a rough start as i found out they weren't exactly faithful but i continued with them as I love them so much and believed they weren't that person and it took me almost a year to get past it, but I think that was due to me having such high expectations of them being nothing like my exes that when they slipped up, I couldn't accept that they were only human and can make mistakes.

My new partner already has a child, a 2 year old girl who is amazingly smart, sweet, but still a royal pain in the ass, but my God the love I do have for her and things I would do if somebody hurt her is something else.
A few months pass and we decide everything seems so right that we decided to get married and it all goes perfectly.. until after were married. 

Now it isn't due to my parter or their daughter.. it's down to both of our exes. Their ex partner was abusive and abusive to their child (my stepdaughter) so they were denied access after they proved to be a danger to my step daughter. So soon after this, they decide to take my partner to court for custody of my step daughter, only for the sake of it being a control thing, not even because they want to be a relevant parent. Now this court shit goes on for the next two years and is still present to this day so I'll move on.

Soon after the court stuff starts my grandad then passed away, possibly through loneliness of being in a home as he lost his leg through sepsis. I still to this day blame myself for my grandfather giving up and I cry to myself in the shower most days about losing both of them and that I only have my mother left of my family.
So this just added to the stress of everything.

But then my partner and I find out were having a baby which brings a lot of light into the darkness were both having. Although the pregnancy turned out to be a bit of a nightmare, our daughter is born happy and healthy, it seems.

A couple months after her being born we discover she has severe dairy allergies and bowel problems which took nearly 3 months and 2 hospital trips to get a diagnosis. So our poor daughter was suffering for months, endless sleepless nights of crying and writhing in pain, just to be told its teething, or colic. This added to out stress as we had to sleep separately to take it in shifts to tend to our daughter, we spend months sleeping apart and seeing each other a few hours a day.

A side note, all this while I've been back at college and h
Then university to better myself to be able to give my family and kids a better life.

Fast forward a few months into my final year at university and I have to drop out as my daughter caught a severe chest infection and feel really ill. So this added to things as I feel like all my progress has gone from the last 5 years. 

Then I manage to land a job in a career field I was excited in that seemed to be with a decent company.

A couple months into working and all seems well, then my partner ends up finding out they may have cancer, so I notify work and have to have a couple of days off and they start being dicks and then terminate my contract through bullshit reasons which I'm appealing. But the added stress of them doing that when were going through a tough time was awful and made me feel like a failure again. 

Now recently I fucked up and hurt my partner by browsing NSFW subreddits briefly, not for any sort of sexual desire, more curiousity. I also watched porn, which I knew my so other wasnt a fan of but didnt expect them to be so against it that it almost ruined our marriage. I accepted their point and vowed not to go on any of it again and havent to this day.

My partner, I know doesnt believe me and continuously checks my phone, which I dont mind as I dont have anything to hide, but it really gets to me when I'm made feel like I'm lying or I've apparently deleted things etc. Which it doesnt help when my history on reddit randomly disappeared and I had no explanation for, si that hit me hard, like great I'm going to get shit for something I havent done and I dont have an explanation as I'm no tech expert. 

It even gets to the point i see my partner searching the internet for the answers I dont have over what seem to me as trivial unimportant things. But it's their feelings so I have to respect them.

But I feel they may be better without me. I see their face daily and they look miserable that they're are with me. I'll ask them and be told it's not me, which I don't believe. As it's rare in the day that they're not making little comments that feel like they are digs at me, even though they say they're not. I also get made feel like I cant have an opinion on anything or anyone if it has any relation to the opposite sex, which I know is down to their insecurities as they have been this way for the most part of our relationship. But it makes me feel like I cant talk, a lot. 

Everything at the moment feels continuously tense or awkward, and I cling to the few moments we have when they smile or are positive, or engage in a nice way or arent making ""a joke"". But I cant really say anything as I hurt them not so long ago and it's probably my fault.

This complete flip in our relationship from when we first got married has broken me. I would normally switch off and just leave, but I love them that much I dont want to as even though this kills me most days (everything that has happened as a whole), I would rather feel pain than not feel anything towards my partner. They are my everything and have always been there. It feels as though they hate me and are continuously trying to convince themselves inside that they dont. But I can see that fight going on. 

I just feel the stress of everything and not dealing with things has sort of built up and most days I feel like ending my own life so I dont have to feel anything, but I also wouldn't have to be alive to know I'm without my partner etc. 


I'm sorry if this all doesnt make sense I've kind of just winged it as I'm having a really bad day today. I'm not looking for sympathy or empathy or anything like that, I kind of just needed to vent, but things are tense at home and recently we cant seem to talk without either of us getting defensive and then arguing.  Plus everyone else tends to have biased opinions.

Under normal situations, I would think there is something seriously physically wrong with me, but I've been here before, this is just how anxiety affects me.

Idk why I'm posting all of this, I guess I've just been having a hard time talking about this irl so I wantex to get it out. People have been so nice to me regarding my inability to function normally, and I really don't feel like I deserve it.",14Jun2019,2
80,"Dear redditors,

I don't like to write a huge post because I am afraid that it will get too overwhelming. Nonetheless this post means a lot to me and I will value every answer from you guys.

I am a 24 years old male who suffers from ADHD and depression. ADHD got a lot better recently and its not a big concern anymore. I went to psychiatry because I was severely depressed in May 2018. After 7 weeks I got out of there and felt much better. Back at home I started to recover even more and therefore decided to stop taking antidepressants. 4 Months later my sleep began to get unrefreshing. I had very low energy throughout the whole day and it didnt get better with rest. My psychiatrist told me that he is quite sure that this has nothing to do with depression as I had recover from it. I did a lot of test (blood tests, celiac disease, lyme disease, thyroid check (also checked for hashimoto's disease), allergies). Then the symptoms got even worse and I started to feel confused, easily distracted and lethargic every day. Recently I feel really weak, especially in my legs and I prefer to sit whenever I can. I catch myself staring without focusing because its to much of an effort and it drains too much from my almost non-existant energy. I decided to do a sleep study. They found quite many cortical arousals (the brain get activated while sleeping) and a mild form of central sleep apnea. The neurologist told me that he thinks that I am probably so very axious while asleep that I should try an anti-anxiety medication first (like lyrica (pregabaline)) in order to treat that mild apnea. I have to admit that I suffered from very intense panic attacks before I got into psychiatry and even when I was there and I am a quite anxious person in gerneral. But the panic attacks stopped after I left psychiatry. Maybe I am afraid to get into university soon because I am unemployed since May 2018 and somehow I am suppressing it to an extent that it isnt noticeable anymore. Anyway that's the theory of my sleep neurologist. What I did as well is a colonoscopy because I often had diarrhea. The colonoscopy was not conspicuous but before we did it I had to send in stool for analysing purposes. It turned out that I have a STEC (toxin producing e. coli bacteria) infection but thag was just 1 month ago and normally this bacteria is going to be excreted in about 2 months. Under this circumstances the bacteria should not be the real cause for my situation (its been 9 months since the unrefreshing sleep and the unbearable symptoms have started). But maybe my body has a hard time to excrete that bacteria. This could maybe be the cause for cfs (chronic fatigue syndrome). And last thing to say would be that I bought a cat and I was heavily allergic to cats in the past BUT I did an allergy check for cat particles and it turned out to be negative. Furthermore I dont get any allergic symptoms when I play with my cat for example. So I am quite sure thaf this couldnt be the cause but I wanted to mention it anyway.

So what could it be:

1) Depression
2) Anxiety
3) CFS
4) Cat allergy
5) An autoimmune disease like MS
6) Anything else? 

The symptoms are really severe and I cant live a normal life anymore. My motivation is verly low but I dont feel depressed (maybe very little). Also I cant notice strong anxiety nor panic attacks at all. The confusion and weakness are insane at the moment and I really need to find out what it could be. Doctors cant help me and I did everything I could over the past 9 months to find it out without any sucess. I know that you are propably no doctors but maybe you have experienced something similar. I am very thankful about every imput of you guys. This community is awesome for sufferers like us and I have big hope of it. 

MANY THANKS GUYS!!",14Jun2019,1

I’ve never been in a romantic relationship and now at 22 I’m feeling very depressed because of it, I’ve only kissed one girl and it went nowhere and recently I’ve started thinking I’m not capable of being loved romantically, I have a lot of friends but I just can’t seem to strike conversation with women when it comes to dating and it hurts me to see other people having romantic relations

84,"Ever feel like everything is terrible? That’s what’s getting to me lately. I feel like a lucky person. I have it relatively good- I’m healthy, my parents are getting much older but still relatively healthy, I have a roof over my head and a decent job. There’s no serious trauma or tragedy in my life personally and for that I am so grateful. But, lately I am dealing with some stress and frustration related to mental health issues with my partner and resulting job-related/financial stress. &amp; I have a new codependent nutty supervisor who kind of gives me anxiety. So lately been feeling pretty burned out and neglected, and like I’m constantly catering to other people’s feelings just to keep the peace at home and at my job. And then, ya know, I look at my phone. And we have a vindictive emotional toddler running our country who is openly treasonous and faces no consequences. He is appointing judges with incredibly radical beliefs to serve for the next 40 years making important decisions that directly impact people’s lives. And this just compounds the feeling of powerlessness and being governed by selfish, unstable people’s emotions, at home, at work, &amp; as an American. (I feel like I should clarify here that I am 100% dedicated to my partner and making our relationship work.) But, I’m still allowed to be frustrated. 

Anyways, the headlines get worse day after day after day and has been that way for at least 3 years now. And this shit just has me down today, along with the personal struggles at home and work. 

It just feels like everything is terrible. Nobody gets held accountable. Vulnerable people get fucked over. The rich get richer and more powerful. Oh, and we’re killing the planet. Speaking of that- On top of a shitty day I came home to find a dead bee on my patio with its tongue out like it had been poisoned. I have a large beautiful garden that is my pride and joy (&amp; what keeps me sane), I don’t use pesticides, insecticides, or any harmful chemicals in my garden. I leave water out for the bees. So I don’t know what happened to this dude, but it was the cherry on top of a shit day. It depressed me more than it should have. We’re killing the pollinators. 

Cue the shit headlines that I’m reading today.

85,"I don't know how to move forward with my life. Apologies in advance, I just need to rant and get this out there.

(tl;dr: Got fired from multiple jobs, no interests and no path to any future, ADHD and major depression, wtf do I do to move forward)

To start this off, I'm 30yo male my parents immigrated when I was 18. I've had a relatively easy life (with some hiccups) up until I went to university for engineering, which I started back in 2006. I failed every single course I took except for programming. I got kicked out after 2 years. I then started college for computer programming, graduated with exceptional marks. All good. Except it wasn't.

I got fired from my first job as a database analyst of 3 years in 2015. I thought I sure will easily find a new employment. Nope, I applied to 400 jobs across US and Canada for 10 months, with not a single interview. I had to make money somehow, I started working as a call center agent, got fired from that. Said fuck it, and moved cities.

I started working another job (also call center), while still applying for software dev jobs. Nope, not a single interview. And I got fired from my job. The issue was that I was always late.

It was recommended that I visit a psychiatrist, and he thought it might be a good idea to take a few screeners, and wouldn't you know it, I tested abnormally high for ADHD. That makes sense, it fits, everything fits! 

The problem is, this diagnosis came as I turned 28, too late.. It has been two years of medication and severe depression, and I can't get myself to even apply for any more jobs. I don't want to get fired so I don't even try to apply. I've been without work for 2 years straight. I did the uber thing and I got bored of it really quickly. I got hired at a payday loan company, those people are the absolute worst in humanity, and I got fired. I worked at a coffee shop baking for 3 months and I hated every second of it. I want to go back to school, but NOTHING is interesting and nothing sounds like I would want to do. Not that I have the money to do go to school in the first place. I had to move back in with my parents.

I just feel stuck, in an endless spiral, getting worse every single day, every single minute. I don't do anything. I have no one to talk to. It's been rough, and I don't know how to get out of it........ I'm just sitting still while the rest of the world moves on as if I don't exist. I am fucking useless and the few people around me would be better off if I just disappeared.",14Jun2019,1
86,"I am awful at talking about my health health due too not being able to properly put into words what’s wrong. 
Those I have tried to speak to about it in the past have complained that I burdened them with my problems. 
I am now surrounded by the loveliest group of friends in my life and my mental health is horrible and I haven’t really spoken to any of them about it. 
When I’m feeling it the worst I end up isolating myself from them in order to not have a negative effect on them or the friendly positive atmosphere but then this makes me feel worse as I feel like I’m missing out and alienating myself from them. They’ve noticed that I’m isolating myself and one has voiced his concerns about me doing it and that as I’ve given them no explanation as to why, they’re increasingly worried. 
I feel so helpless in this situation because I know they would be so supportive it’s just I don’t want to bother them with my shit when they’ve got stuff going on, it’s not fair on them. I’ve tried to explain to some of them that I struggle to put my emotions into words but even by doing this it still makes me feel like I’m burdening them. 
Any advice would be very appreciated but if not this is just a vent, I just feel so stupid and useless.",14Jun2019,2

89,"My boyfriend has had really bad anxiety and depression.  from what I saw, not counting the bad parts I’m sure he kept private, it was debilitating. He was falling apart. Well now he’s got a therapist he goes to weekly and has started taking a few medications and in the past month and a half or two, the change in him has been incredible. He’s noticed, I’ve noticed. He’s fresh, and happier, and not constantly on edge. 

But the new meds have completely killed his sex drive. Like to almost nothing. He’s trialed a few and these are the ones that work best for his mental health issues, so I would never even suggest he switch it up for the sake of a good lay, but damn. And when he is in the mood (aka twice since starting all this compared to all the damn time before) it doesn’t last more than 10 min and he says he can’t cum basically at all. So foreplay is fun but we don’t make it to the other part. He seems a little bothered by this when we talked too, but like me seems to like feeling relaxed more. 

I want him to be happy and calm and in a good place. I also want to have a sex life with my boyfriend. But I’ve decided if this is as much as I’m getting for now, I love him and that’s okay. I’d rather snuggle and just lay next to a guy who isn’t being tormented by his mind than go at it like rabbits with someone who feels as low as he did.

97,"So there’s this girl I used to be best friends (let’s call her R) with. It was me, her and our other friend (F) who were basically inseparable, we talked basically every day for like two years and it was great.  

Sometimes there were times where it felt a bit like they were freezing me out but I honestly think it was my anxiety (as in; my anxiety made it feel like it was happening which made me react like it was, which then later caused it if that makes sense) 

Well last year R moved to another state to study and we managed to keep contact a little, enough for us to invite each other to birthdays but not so much best friends anymore. And this year I moved as well, so I’m actually closer to her than I was last year but it feels like we’re not friends anymore. I’ve tried a few times to message and idk if I’m imagining it but she kind of gives me closes answers until the conversation dies off, and in our group chat if I’m talking usually she just reads messages and won’t reply to me (me specifically in a group with 5 of us she will speak to everyone else)
I’ve come to find that this week F and another girl in our group went to go visit R only a few hours away from me and I wasn’t told about it. I know people grow apart but I just didn’t think it would hurt so much. 

I’m thinking of messaging her and seeing if she might want to hang out this weekend but I’m terrified of her rejecting me, I think it’s just my anxiety reading into it too much because I’ve never been able to tell if it’s all in my head or if things are actually happening.

I am a 21 year old Male from the UK.
I am writing about self love but before I dive into I need to tell you why I’ve always doubted myself and always thought I wasn’t good enough.
When I was younger around 14-15 I had a group of friends, it was an okay group we were all boys but one day before we broke up for the summer holidays they all abandoned me. I went to the toilet and when I came back they all had ran off, obviously this is where it all started that entire summer was the worst summer of my life and it got worse as I lost an important person in my life what didn’t help is that I didn’t have my so called friends there, instead I had people who I had never thought as friends reach out to me when they noticed I didn’t come back to school. 
This period in my life began a time of self doubt and I genuinely disliked who I am but don’t ever change who you are I’m now having the best times with the love of my life, my best friends and family.

I was always a self conscious boy but I’ve grown to love myself over the years or I’m working on it.

So when people give glib advice such as take any job.

They assume that everyone can just get any job. 

But can they?

If that were true then we wouldn't have a housing foreclosure crisis with high apt rents and high homelessness.

Right?

Everyone would be working and there would be zero unemployment.

But that's not how Capitalism works.

So back to my statement, when someone says ""just take,"" as though you pick one like you pick a piece of fruit, but then you look at the other factors or variables.

Factors or variables.

That could be:

* debt liens, housing &amp; healthcare costs

* cost to use healthcare with prescriptions and doctor visits

* transportation 

* dental and vision

* coming out of a non dischargeable debt situation from the last job loss

Why do people shut me down when I attempt to explore how on earth can I even produce in a low wage job when my basic income needs are NOT met.

What is the REASON why some adultd shut down another adult when they are trying to problem solve to ""make it work"" when in actuality it appears that ""any low income job wont do"" bc some employers want a person who will stick around &amp; not keep looking or someone who isn't going to get injured on the job from lack of sleep or economic deprivation.

People who are underpaid and not meeting their income needs can potentially be a risk for an employer.

Employers know how to look for that.

Older people dont get any job as easily as a younger person bc it is obvious their expenses can be more.

I grew up in an unsupported family, My mom and dad both died when I was young so I was living with my aunt. Throughout my childhood I was alone no one in my family would try and spend time with me and I missed out on the important emotional support a kid should receive.  I've learned how to hide my feeling behind a happy persona that I feel isn't me, but since I've been doing it so long I don't know the actual me. I felt like being depressed or complaining around or to people would just bring them down too. I spent most of my childhood on Youtube because that was the only ""support/positive human interaction"" I could get. Because my family was so standoffish I tried to create my self in the way I see Fit. I took morals from different content creators and try and mold myself around the person I think would be the best me. So throughout my teen years, I was on youtube and had little interaction with classmates in HS. I've never had a GF or even dated because I don't understand how to do that, probably relating to me not having a mother figure in my life. I feel like I'm not the best I can be and I don't deserve someone if I'm not worth wanting. I fear someone feeling trapped and not able to go out and find the right person for them, someone who will treat them better then I could. I want to be something my significant other is proud to have and not ashamed to be around me. I've recently been going to therapy and she told me I might have to High of expectations of myself, but how could I ever be happy knowing I not good enough for the person I'm with. Recently, I've been hanging out with a friend from school and I see her in relationships and it makes me feel like a useless unwanted person. I'm not appealing to anyone and I can't blame them. Just knowing that she could find her happiness with someone else envies me. Another recent situation was I was at work and I have this little cat thing that waves its hand on my desk. I put in the window to get sunlight but my co-worker (Same girl as before) took it and put it on her desk. I don't know why but I really hurt me and I don't understand why this tiny plastic toy meant so much. so I put it on my desk and haven't taken it out. (P.s my depression stems from not having a mother figure and feeling alone and unloved when I was a child, currently, I don't have anyone to go to when I'm feeling down and it makes life really hard) (also this is missing other events from when I was young so this is kinda an overview of my life and current weird thing happing.)

106,"  My father has had mental health issues all his life though has either manipulated therapists into never addressing his issues or refusing to go to therapists he can't manipulate into avoiding discussing himself. I have other posts on here from earlier this year of things he has done.

 I don't want to discuss it much right now because it really starts making me panic if I think about it for too long. But besides that I am 15 currently, homeschooling myself, chronically ill and cannot drive. I do not want to leave my dog because he means the world to me and is one of the few things that has kept me happy recently.

  My dad is awful to my mother and to our dog and for example earlier today my father started screaming at our dog because he got excited that my dad grabbed his keys and started jumping on him. My mom tried to tell him that if he wants our dog to listen to him and not jump on him that he needs to tell him to sit calmly. My dad got furious at this and went on for ten minutes yelling at her at how all he wanted to do was complain and why is she so terrible and can't let him complain and that she wasn't trying to help him but just not let him complain and how stupid is she for not understanding that.

  I just got very upset and felt terrible because I don't understand why someone can be so mean when a person is trying to help them and why can't he just be nice to us? Why does he have to call me a mistake and tell me to kill myself because I'm worthless and don't matter because I dropped a plate? I just wish this would all end and I just feel trapped and totally lost. We don't have enough money to send me to a therapist because all of our money is being spent by my dad buying glasses and baseball season passes. My mom doesn't want to divorce him because she says she doesn't want to lose half of everything.

  I don't know what to do and to be honest right now I don't see the point in going on. If they can't get divorced and my dad can't leave the house, I don't see a reason in living. I just want this all to end so desperately and I just feel so lost and hopeless. I know I won't be able to get a normal job and live a normal life because I am very chronically ill and was taken out of school because I very rarely ever made it in a full week of school.

107,"I have severe anxiety (which a therapist confirmed) and I get panic attacks due to large crowds, strangers, or loud noises (those are just three I know of so far) 

I was friends with this guy awhile ago, and whenever we were on a video call, he would play video games. There would be loud noises and I'd flinch, he'd see and ask if I was okay. At first, I just lied and said I was fine. Then it became too much. The next time it happened, I told him that I got panic attacks from loud noises and he was super understanding... but didnt change anything. 

The few times we met up at school (because we go to the same school), he was just the same, loud and obnoxious, and gave me panic attacks. 

I asked him to stop once more, and he did for like three minutes. 

to end this story on a somewhat happy note, a few of my friends noticed that I was getting panic attacks around this guy and told me that I either had to end the friendship with him, or they would do it for me. We're not friends anymore, and we just casually wave to each other in the halls sometimes when we see each other. My panic attacks havent happened as much as when I was his friend, so thats great.

I'm not looking for advice or anything, I just wanted to tell a personal story about my mental health, anxiety wise. And maybe to helo other people that are possibly in the same position to realize that if your ""friend"" is considerate to your mental health, you either need to tell them whats going on, or end the relationship.",14Jun2019,7

109,"Hi. For these +-3 years, I’ve been dealing with depression. I went to counselling sometimes but never been to a therapy or take any medication before. I feel like I somehow find a way to calm myself down and made me feel better. Though I feel like I’m healing, getting out of that loop hole, there’s always something in my mind which constantly reminds me what I’ve done in my lowest point and it irritates me. I feel ashamed and embarrassed of who I was and it effects my social life and interaction with people around. It affects the way I see myself sometimes and I realize that it also makes me lower my standard in every thing. I used to be an optimistic person but now all I can say to describe myself is shitty. In some other days, I can be really proud of myself for being strong despite everything but that voice keeps telling me otherwise and sometimes I let myself drown. I don’t like being this way. I wanna go back to my “carefree, cheerful, and optimistic” self.",14Jun2019,1
110,"So for about a year plus now I’ve been getting insane anxiety every time one of my family members leaves the house. For example, my mom went to the the store in the rain and didn’t come back for an hour and I thought something bad happened to her. Another time, we stoped at a restaurant to get food and when she had been inside for a while I was scared that something happened to her so I almost had a panic attack in the car. 

It’s not just with her either. I have this issue with my dad and siblings too. The only time I’m comfortable leaving them is if I can easily call them and sometimes I make up dumb excuses to do so just so I know they haven't gotten into an accident or something crazy. I’m getting a therapist soon but for now I just wanted to know if anyone could relate or heard of anything like this before. Separation anxiety was the only thing that I saw while researching.

113,"Hi, so to start off I have been diagnosed with PTSD and GAD about five years ago, and take a lexapro. But recently, my anger has been through the roof. I scream, cry, ramble pessimistic nonsense (like how everyone hates me even though I know I have people who love and care for me), have really (and I mean reaaallly) negative thoughts, self harm, and break and tear things that are near me. I really hate these tantrums that I have because I know I shouldn't be acting like that. It also doesn't help that I have a short fuse, and I can get irritated at about everyone and everything. 

Does anyone have any similar emotions or experiences? Advice for how to control and/or stop my anger issues would be highly appreciated. :)

I had already prepared the cruel fucking rant I usually do when I explode right in my head ready to go. I felt my adrenaline skyrocket and vision red. I was ready to explode violently all geared up inside. It was all consuming and all I felt. Then instant drop. All in the span of three seconds at most. It was the most reeling shit I’ve ever experienced. I’m glad I didn’t lose it even if inside I fucking did at my friend cause I care for him deeply, but at the same time I spent the next ten minutes in a state of getting the explosion and dropping instantly right after.

118,"I use my own version of thought defusion mainly thought challenging to try to go against or sit with those thoughts but I have come to realise its not the negative thoughts about myself that bothers me it’s what’s behind them which are negative strong core beliefs about myself which has been driving everything. 

What I mean like I’ll have the thought like “you’re such a worthless piece of shit, you are a complete failure” or whatever it is and I agree with it and Kinda laugh at the fact that it’s completely true. But that doesn’t bother me because it is a core belief.
So when I try to challenge these beliefs my mind fights back and resists and it becomes a whole big thing in my head and yea.

I don’t know how to reprogram this out of my head which would be unrealistic because up until this point of time it’s objectively true, and I really don’t expect anything from this post and I’ll probably delete it because I’ll wake up in a different headspace.

My question is how can I stop or reduce the chances that my motivation and mood (mainly motivation) from being negatively effected.

Has someone experienced this and how have they managed is probably a better way to frame that question.

119,"To me, schooling (with all the stress and hell) was *the only* escape from this nightmare (temporarily) due to its forced nature.

I took the easiest/slow paced courses so that the stress would not over load my routine. I never had friends, I never dated, and I never did anything away from the routine.

At 19, my parents and doctors pushed a label of autism/aspergers onto me due to my social avoidance. No one except me knew why I did the things because the hoarding life style was never brought up. I was way too scared.

In college, my goal was to get a degree that made at least $15 per hour. I did engineering, computer science, and accounting. However, due to the habits of the hoarding home (isolation, procrastination, avoidance) I struggled in my classes. I never believed I would get hired. 

I mold myself to the environment. Shit everywhere and no ability to clean it up? I will out shit your shit. 

So effectively I am the biggest pig in this home. I never bathe, I hardly change clothing, I eat extremely messily on the floor (no table). When I spill food I hardly clean it up(roach food now). And I never interact socially with the world.

See the thing is, as a coping mechanism, I cannot improve myself in this hoarding environment. So I just become even more disgusting than this miserable place. 

It is like, why would you wear a tuxedo to an oil rigging site? I constantly feel like I am submerged in gunk. 

My schedule for the last 7 years: go to bed late, wake up whenever, eat lots of food, get depressed, read about what I am missing out on, get FOMO,  read reddit/watch anime/watch YouTube, watch porn, get even more depressed, find something motivational, try to break habits, streak goes on for a few weeks until I feel suicidal, try to kill myself or scream at my parents, cope by relapsing on my habits, repeat.

And as long as I live in this hoarding home, I will have zero friends and most likely die a virgin.

126,"Hi!

I'm 18, and for 8 years, I've been downright petrified of a movie. I'd rather not say the title, and would prefer that nobody does in the comments either. But I will say that it's an extremely disturbing German horror film. Even just hearing the title will leave me with horrific intrusive thoughts and images. I clicked onto a Dan and Phil Games video a few minutes ago and they mentioned it unexpectedly. Immediately, I clicked off, and have been shaking since. I'll probably be on edge for days, and honesty, I'll be surprised if I can sleep tonight. 

I've never even seen this movie. I've only seen the cover and read the synopsis, but I guess that was enough for me to form a phobia.

I worked at a film store for a while, and I refused to go into the H's in the horror section. If someone was looking for a movie there, I would have a co-worker take them to find it. Once, I saw the spine of the film and yelled out in fear in the middle of the store. Whenever we got new things traded in, I would look through the new arrivals so that I would know if I had to find a way to avoid it or not. It's on Netflix, and I'm scared to browse the site now in case I manage to stumble across it (which has happened before, as I do like horror films so long as there's no body horror).

This is miserable. I'm living my life in fear of a stupid movie that nobody even likes, but is still infamous and popular enough that I can't seem to escape it.

Would hypnotherapy be beneficial to be in getting over this fear? I've gotta do something about it, it can't keep ruling over me like this. How does it work, exactly? I'm assuming they don't just snap their fingers and magically get rid of the fear in one session.

I don't know what to do anymore, as I find my self constantly just becoming sad and angry at the smallest shit. I have zero tolerance for much of anything, wright or wrong.

I haven't been checked out by a phycologist, so I'm not entirely sure. My mother says hormones, and that may be the case.

Just the smallest things set me off. I'm not good at my hobbies? Oh, well, I just fucking suck ass, and not deserve to live. I over react to alot.

I yell at my friend's alot, bring up my problems super fast, almost like I'm looking for attention.

I'm a boring person, as I'm not into drugs and alcohol, and find myself constantly fighting myself I've over the stupid shit.


**WARNING, THIS IS THE SEXUAL PART**

I also have this sexual problem, that ties into my mentality, and I fucking hate it.



Let me use a friend as example. He hates chucking, but finds it hot in porn, like normal people. While they find it taboo in an actual relationship, they don't mind it in a video ment to satisfy your sexual needs.

I, on the other hand, not fond of stop clubs, going from man to man, or prostitution. I find nothing wrong with the people that are into that, it's just the way I am. I'm into kinky, romantic, sex, with the same partner. So, naturally, I kinda stick to certain things.

But every now and then, I will watch a video, or read some comic, with all that, plus more, and I just find it so hot. Then I finally get off to it, and sit there thinking about it, and just shut down, as I start to over think it.

I honestly don't know how to explain this feeling, I just need help figuring it out. Is it because I haven't tied the knot with anyone yet? Am I just a boring person for not being into these kinky settings and such? Am I just being dramatic?

for some more context, I'm basically like

""No, Were not having a foursome with another couple, even if we stick to our respective partners, and just fuck in the same bed"", ""no, we're not going to that gay bar, don't need some guy hitting on me or you"", ""no, I'm not gonna make out with a chick while you fuck me"", or ""no, I'm not gonna let another dude ram my ass while I blow you""

130,"I also have headaches from time to time. And most of the time my head feels so weird. I also have DP/DR, so that doesn't make it any better. Somehow I'm so sensitive and easily stressed, probably because the last few years were extremely stressful and that worsened my mental health. I also got a burnout while I went to school. I'm actually better now, but somehow I'm still not alright. Something isn't quite right. I just want to enjoy my life, study languages and work on my music, but my head isn't alright with that all the time. I can work on my stuff a bit, but I can get mentally exhausted easily and that reminds me of burnout. DP/DR really sucks too. That combo really sucks.

Am I not really over my burnout? Or is it suppressed emotions?

I actually wanted to go to therapy, but convincing my mom is so hard. One day she says that she doesn't understand why I need to go to therapy and she thinks that they might put me in an asylum or something, the next day she says she never said she's against it. Although I kept on explaining why I want to go to therapy. I listed some good reasons, but it's hard convincing ignorant people.

I understand that she's against medication, and I actually agree with her on that point; but doctors can actually help diagnose me and tell me what to do. Doctors don't force you to take medication. I wouldn't take medication. But for some reason she still doesn't get it. I just need some guidance... I really want to try and go to therapy and see how it goes. I've tried living my life without thinking ""Oh I have depression and anxiety and dp/dr"" and without thinking negative things and overthinking, but... I'm still not quite alright. Something is just out of balance and I've got to do something about it - but my mom doesn't make it easy at all. Why is it so hard to get some help?

Somehow things are kinda complicated, but I don't know what is complicated. That gives me a headache sometimes. Sometimes life is just a headache to me.

133,"I don’t remember the last time I felt anything. I watch people laughing and having a good time and I feel absolutely nothing. We are currently caring for my elderly nan so we often discuss “when the time comes” and my mother and the rest of my family understandably get very tearful but I have no feelings or emotional responses. 
I used to be very outgoing and social, I would be out all weekend and weeknights too with various friends. I now do anything to avoid any sort of social outings I don’t even like going to the supermarket. 

I completely avoid any sort of romantic life, I get asked out frequently and sometimes I agree but only because it’s been too long since my last date. As soon as I meet them I’m immediately turned off and uninterested even if they’re obviously great. My friends get very frustrated with me as they’re all married/living with partners and I guess I don’t fit in enough. They do still include me. I struggle because I don’t feel attracted to anyone AT ALL. Not even a tiny bit. However would like to point out I’m always horny. 

It’s not all bad though, I started as admin in a company 4 years ago and somehow have received promotion after promotion. My job is probably the only part of my life I currently enjoy, i literally turn my outside life off as soon as I walk into work. On Monday it will be announced I am the manager of the floor I’m currently on which is a considerably large step up. Although I enjoy my job and the new salary is crazy I don’t feel accomplished or overjoyed. I suppose I say I enjoy it as in.. compared to the rest of my life I feel content with it. 

Back info: I went to uni when I was younger, lived with mates, had mad holidays, had loads of boyfriends, live with my ex boyfriend for 6 years, we separated amicably 2 years ago. Had boyfriends since but the last year I just absolutely have zero interest. I suppose what I’m trying to show is that I haven’t always been this way.

I wondered if I was bipolar, but reading descriptions of being bipolar doesn't sound like me at all. I don't have manic highs, I just have really low lows, which come on without warning. Then I have some periods in-between those lows where I feel completely okay. For the whole month of April and most of May I was extremely depressed, and then a couple of weeks ago I just started to feel normal again.

138,"I'm 17 years old and I am POSITIVE I have some mental issue but I have no idea what it is or how I can be cured from it. 

When I was a baby, my parents divorced, but after few years they moved back in together because they thought it would be better for me to have both parents around. Instead they always fought, cussed each other out, and sometimes my mum would kick my dad out of the house for days. 

As a child, whenever I had tantrums, my mum told me I would hit myself, usually my legs. I remember several times I bruised my thighs. 

Fast forward to middle school, I was academically good but I was bullied by one of my friends, and I started cutting my arms. My friend/bully reported to the office and I had to speak to the counsler. They called in my mum and she gave me a talk while she cried about how stupid I was for doing that to myself.

Another fast forward to near the start of junior year, or 2018 October. I was getting all As, maybe several Bs. Parents expected me to be a good student and I think I was. I had good friends around me, i KNEW that but i still felt alone. One night, my dad and mum were fighting, and he started to involve me by asking me questions. I broke down, started crying and yelling at both of them, but they instead started yelling at me to calm down. My mum told me to walk outside to get a breather. I did so, and started contemplating about how life would be if I didnt exist. The next day, I voluntarily went to talk to my counsler just for advice, but instead she called child services. My mum got mad at me for over exaggerating the situation and told me ""what happens in the house stays in the house"". She said people didnt need to know if we were mad or fighting because all families fight. Few weeks after, a cop and child services came to my house to interview me, and I just told them ""everything is good. I over exaggerated it.""

And finally to today. Today was my first day of summer, but sadly I was sick. I was really bothered by my coughing, and I irritated my mum. She left to buy me cough drops, and when she came back she started yelling at me and cussing at me about how I need to stop giving her attitude like that, and how I ""did this to myself"" [getting myself sick] because of how much I go out to hang out with friends. ""Its not my fault you're busy and you dont come home."" I got very frustrated, my head started hurting and I started crying. At that moment, I truly was suicidal, more than I ever felt in my life. I started crying, screaming, and hitting myself. My mum kept telling me to get up and calm my self down. She said she was going to leave me at home. Right when she went outside and closed the door, i almost involuntarily was stood up and walked to the kitchen. I grabbed the knife, and my mum ran  to me and said ""what do you think you're doing"". I let go because at that moment I realized what I was doing and dropped to the floor and cried. I started telling my mum ""you dont love me. You dont care for me."" She started to hug me and said I love you, but I was just so mad that I hit her legs with my arms and she became mad at me again. She threatened to call child services and told me I needed help. I told her ""no"" and she went away. I was in the living room just crying, no more yelling and hitting myself just crying. She finally came to me and hugged me and said I love you again. I was finally calm but currently I'm still mad and sad at her and at me. 

My parents sometimes make me feel so shitty. Maybe I am over exaggerating, maybe because I'm just a teenager. I took AP psychology last year, and I know teenagers have this ideology of personal fables and imaginary audiences where they seem so self conceited and that every problem they have is most important than other people's. I took the class to hopefully learn ways to cope with this, but I'm even more confused. 

My parents are good too though, I dont want it to seem as if they are always fighting and always like how I described. They do buy me everything i need, they support my academics and extracurriculars, and they always think of me. 

Personally, I just want to feel better for myself. I dont want to see counslers anymore, I feel like they just dump my problems to someone else like child services or the police, but I just want advice.

I want to be able to live life with confidence and make full use of all the opportunities I have. But I don't know how I can change if I refuse to accept that I need help and let people in. I refuse to accept that I deserve help for these endless breakdowns and sleep-deprived nights full of overthinking because I feel like I'm not doing enough to turn my life around by myself. And now I want my life to end because I've reached my breaking point and I still don't know how to make a first step towards a better life. I can't keep this up...",14Jun2019,1

I have no passion in my hobbies, I have no passion for the work I'm studying for, and I am so sick of it, and I don't know if this is even normal. I hear and see people talk about their work and hobbies with such passion and pride, yet I never felt any of it.",14Jun2019,2

I'm aware that my post is probably too long, **(tl;dr at the end)** and that there are no easy answers to this, especially because I (think I) know the correct answer, but it's kind of out of the question, so I guess I'm asking the best way around it. Anyway, here it goes...

I'm a young woman who has suffered from depression almost half of my life. I got some help during my adolescent years, but the problem didn't go away, or it appeared again. Last year, after a couple years of suffering, I managed to pick myself up just enough to try to find help, and I found a great therapist. From the day I decided to contact her, I really had my hopes up about therapy, mostly because I did some research on my doc, and i was pretty impressed by her, so I couldn't wait to start, thinking that I'll be ""saved"" with the help of this woman. 

At first, we had some bumps on the road because of our differences, but we were both pretty resilient, so things started to work. She really did help me. But last 3-4 months, it's not going so great. We have a communication problem, mostly on my side. I don't know if it's that hard for me to open up, or is it because of the way I view her. I suspect that the big part of the problem is my admiration for her as a person and as a professional, which is why I'm maybe more shy around her than I actually am. Because of that, I found her kind of intimidating at the beginning (and I still do, a bit).

&amp;#x200B;

But then, another problem popped out. I found myself thinking about her in a wrong way and having not-so-healthy attachment to her. 

Sometimes, the way I feel about her is like I'm wishing she is my mother. I've identified the traits that she has, and mom doesn't, to see what I'm missing there, and what I've found is that I see her as a stronger person than my mother, in a way more protective of me and more understanding, so I feel really safe with her and I feel that whatever I say, she will be able to handle it, and kind of carry me trough it. She is, in some way, a role model I never or just rarely saw in my mom, even though my mother is an amazing woman, and she would do everything for me.

Another times, I would see her in a romantic way (I'm not straight). I haven't fantasized about her in a sexual way, at least not yet, but I guess it is/could be going that way. It's more of a sensual attraction (if that is what it's called) so far, where I have fantasies about touching her gently, cuddling and so on, and with some romantic feelings present. 

I've read somewhere that the first kind of feelings I've described are some needs that weren't met when I was young, and the other kind of feelings are just me wanting an equal relationship, probably with someone who has similar traits or someone who treats me in a nice way, as she does. But again, I often had those older woman crushes, so that's pretty usual for me, and it may again be some problem with my mother. I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

Last two moths I've been avoiding therapy. I guess I sounded and seemed just fine and I didn't bring up any new subjects/wasn't interested in talking to her about anything (even if we still have a lot to discuss), so I think she has an impression that things are okay and I need some kind of a break, to just enjoy and feel fine, before we can move on further. But of course, it's the transference that's bugging me the most. I have these unknown feelings that don't really go together, and at times, I'm also angry at her for ""making me"" feel this way, or angry because I know she can't and doesn't want to have some sort of \~special relationship\~ with me, that my mind is dreaming about. Also, I feel very jealous of fer husband and kids. 

I know these kinds of feelings are a normal part of therapy, and a lot of people have them, one way or the other. I also know that those are a great opportunity for progress in therapy, but I can't talk to my doc about it. Even if I wanted to, I wouldn't be able to spit it out, or even send it to her in an email. 

I want to ask you for an opinion. Is there a way i get through this on my own, without talking to anybody? Like, with the help of introspection and grieving? (I'm not kidding. xD) + With trying to find someone who I can be romantically involved who isn't my therapist, but who treats me great as well. Maybe I can work on myself and become the person my younger self needed as a role model. 

The other option is to go to a different therapist, work through those feelings for my doc and then return after a break? (Again, I'm not kidding. xD) Or not to return at all and find a therapist that I'm not so amazed by and with who I can talk with freely? Because, even if I tell her, and even if we sort it out, chances are that I'll still admire her and be less open/shy around her/intimidated by her. What's your opinion?

 

**tl;dr I admire my therapist, and I'm shy around her, so I can't communicate properly with her. Also, I sometimes view her as and ideal mother, or have romantic feeling and dream of touching her. Also also, I'm sometimes mad at her, jealous of her kids and husband, and all of that is not really helping our therapeutic relationship, as you can guess. I can't tell her/don't want to/don't see the point, maybe. So, should I stay (work through it alone in some way, or with another therapist and come back) or should i go (away and just find another therapist)? Sorry and thanks.**",14Jun2019,1
142,"I was doing some art ""prompts"" with a friend of mine in order to get used to my watercolor art supplies. The prompt was ""Introduction/Presentation"". This is what I came up with, and I don't really even know where it came from but the few people I've shown it to seemed to like the concept as it relates to mental health and self-worth (or self-truth? or feeling like a fraud?). So I thought I would like to share it with others who may connect with it.  


Please take this post down if you feel it's too negative, I don't want to unintentionally upset anyone. Thanks for allowing me to share my art :)

143,"So I live in Ireland and our weather isn’t great at all. It’s never extreme (which is a benefit) but it’s always so bloody mild. I’m usually fine in winter and autumn. I quite like the cold weather and don’t mind it raining then mainly because it’s winter...but my problem is with spring and summer. It just doesn’t warm up here and we get so little sun! I personally love warm weather (&gt;23 C) and blue skies but it’s simply something I never get to experience here. 
Since I’ve started dating my girlfriend who lives abroad and gets actual summer I’ve become quite depressed by the weather here. It’s June and every day I’m walking to work wearing my autumn jacket and a scarf because some days it’s only 10 degrees. 
I’m just wondering if seasonal affective disorder can happen in summer time too if the weather is like this. Quite often now I find myself very tired, devoid of many interests or motivation and just fixated on the black and grey clouds and the persistent rain, not forgetting the cold too. 
Is it possible? Or is it solely confined to the wintertime?

TL;DR bad weather making me sad
Possible for S.A.D in summer",14Jun2019,1

He told me he feels alone, like he doesn’t fit in anywhere, he began to cut himself. He had a meeting at his school today and they called me to talk. 

School is out and I’m going to get him tomorrow. We are going to tell my parents together, I’m a little nervous. My parents are supportive people but I’m not sure how to tell them/how they will react.

148,"So as I stated in the title I don’t really understand my mind and it bugs me when it happens. I get really emotionally attached to people and get to the point to where I’m a big part of their life as the happy go lucky joker and I whole heartily love my friends to the point where I’ve invested blood, sweat, and tears into the relationship. Then suddenly at random even if I’m with them I just stop caring about them and it kills me to the point I cry myself to sleep thinking about how I’ve betrayed them. I feel as if I’ve used them this whole time. The worst one happened recently with my gf, we’ve known each other since 5th grade and have become so close that I planned on marrying her when I could afford it but out of nowhere it clicked in my head and I didn’t feel anything towards her anymore it got worse with the fact that she’s been hospitalized and we don’t know what it is but though I know I should feel something but all that went through my mind when I was told was well if she dies she dies and it’s eating me up.

150,"I'm 31 and suffer from following conditions;

- gender dysphoria

- avoidant personality disorder (extreme social anxiety)

- dependent personality disorder

- depression

- underdeveloped social skills

- chronic sleep issues with unknown cause (multiple sleep specialists have no idea)

I've seen two therapists, both of which I really liked and thought were a good fit for me. However, I don't really feel like either were able to help.

I've tried a few different medications, and none of them help in the slightest. In fact, alcohol and party drugs are the only thing that make being social manageable, but since I don't have friends anymore, I can't really do that.

I was previously self employed and sold my company a few years ago and am now retired. I have no need to ever leave my house, in which I live alone. I only have two friends, both who I only ever see 1-on-1 and we're not even very close. My 6 year relationship ended about a year ago.

What help can anyone provide to someone like me? I don't mean to sound defeatist, but I just don't feel like there's anything they can say or do that would help.

I know what I need to do, and it's the same thing my psychs told me to do. I feel like that's all my psych sessions devolved to. Trying to encourage me to go out and do things... Join a sport team, volunteer somewhere, get a job. Years have passed and I haven't made any progress. 

What help can anyone give me other than encourage me to go out and do things?",14Jun2019,0
151,"So I just moved (legally) to the US over a year ago. I don't have insurance yet because all the jobs that I had are temporary- like it'll only last for 5 months max. And most of these companies don't offer insurance like on the start date or even after a few weeks to a month. I'm completely aware that it all depends on the company. I really want to know how can I look for a mental health clinic without having insurance, and without having to pay $100- $500 for that visit. I noticed that most of the healthcare facilities take advantage of you in such a way that when you're done with your visit, they give you this amount, and when you ask them if that's all- they'd say yes then the next month you're gonna get a bill from the mail with extra $400 on top of the original bill that you talked about.
