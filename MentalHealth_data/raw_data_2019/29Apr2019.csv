0,"None of my friends seem to care that I've been acting differently, but even I've noticed my change. I'm irrationaly angry, and starting to isolate myself alot. The last time I felt this alone was when my ex left, and that landed me in the hospital. I don't want to go back there ever again.

I want to disappear, but not die. It would be better for everyone if I was gone, but death scares me, and I don't think I have it in me to attempt suicide again.

I'm surrounded by people I'm told care, but I feel like no one really does. Friends have stopped talking to me, no one initates conversations, and the only people I feel like my death would actually effect is my family. In fact, the only reason I haven't gone through with any attempts recently is my family, but they won't be around forever, and soon enough, I'll have no one left to live for.

I feel like all I've been doing lately is making people upset, and being a massive burden. I feel like if I just disappeared, life for others would get better. It's reached a point where I spend hours on end thinking about how much better life without me would be. I'm a dead weight to everyone around me, and there is nothing I can to do to stop bringing them down.

I don't want help anymore. I don't want advice. I don't even want to keep taking these meds. I just want to post this, and hope that at least one of my friends cares enough about me to find it, amd talk to me. I just want a friend who cares.",29Apr2019,2
1,"I was given the option to sit for a short video after my volunteer job, to have a one on one discussion about how autism can affect some people, and my experiences with it. My workplace is planning to host an access day for people with autism, and they wanted my help in understanding what it means to deal with it. It was...cathartic, and a little nerve wracking, to speak so openly about it not just to a work colleague, but knowing hundreds more are gonna listen to me later. It's the first time I've tried to convey a message about mental conditions to anyone, and I really hope I did a good job explaining it. All I could give were my own experiences with autism, saying that it's gonna change from person to person, but I think I did a good enough job. Hopefully the lesson gets out.

I don’t know if this was because I usually shop at night when there is a lot less people. I just started new medication for my anxiety 2 days ago. I’m usually scared of running into classmates, but I’ve never experienced anxiety as bad as this for that. I regularly go shopping during days and times that I don’t usually.

so recently ive noticed that I see shadows in the corner of my eye. the other day, i heard this kid saying “hey” to me when he wasnt.
I have seen people out my window when they are not there, always feel like people (my mom especially) are calling my name when they’re not. extremely paranoid about people talking about me and i feel like everyones watching me in school. always feel like cameras are watching me in school and sometimes question if my house is bugged with cameras, in the bathroom or in the ceiling. used to wonder that my dog wasnt real and she was constantly being switched with a different dog, or she was sent by someone to watch me and report my actions. I used to think she had cameras behind her eyes and she was always watching me. I sometimes question if my mom is drugging me. sometimes I feel like i can see deeper into reality than most people and wonder if i am truly a genius and i just havent discovered anything yet. also, lately have been compulsively researching schizophrenia after finding out that my aunt has it, and trying to match these things with that condition. i feel like im kind of a hypochondriac trying to figure out whats wrong with me because ive been through doctors and psychiatrists for years because ive always had some sort of problem. i feel a feeling inside of me that makes me feel like theres something wrong with me, plus im not like other kids at all even though i seem like it. i cant sleep, i feel insane, im always trying to self diagnose myself with something, and i am so stressed out all the time that i feel sick to my stomach 24/7 almost. i cant even keep track of my conversations or ideas for very long which sounds a lot like adhd which im very prone to thanks to my dad. sometimes i walk around the school for half hours at a time not knowing where im going, or constantly changing my direction. i feel like im getting closer to losing my marbles all the time, and a lot of these “symptoms” have increased after i found out about my aunt having schizophrenia. im very fascinated by the illness and i think thats why i compulsively, almost obsessively, research it and feel like my symptoms are caused by that, but then i feel bad because i know that all of you guys really do have to struggle with something as terrible as schizophrenia. if someone could give me some insight as to what may be the real issue here, im all ears. i know youre not doctors and one of the rules of this page is not to ask if you have schizoprenia, and im not asking, im just sharing my experiences recently and i feel like this is a good place to let it out, and hopefully get some friendly feedback. i am not trying to offend ANYONE.",29Apr2019,0

The title of this was the thought that went through my mind in the mental back and forth. Admittedly, it’s from a movie I Saw recently, but it stuck with me. Part of every journey, every story, every experience is the end. However, I also thought if this was the end of the story, or possibly, just the end of a chapter of a larger story.

7,"Hello there,  
Made a throw away for this as I don't want it linked to anything (teacher).

  
I am finding this incredibly difficult to write, as the anxiety and brain fog are real. Perhaps a full day's work doesn't help. I've been able to feel the anxiety for the better part of an hour at this point. (Heart-rate is normal, just an intense anxious feeling).  


Over the course of the past few months, I have had a few episodes of social anxiety (episodes for me at least, I think I'm fairly well adjusted). The past few weeks have dialed up the intensity heavily. I feel increasingly isolated and alone. I'll usually acknowledge when I'm in the episode and push through it anyway, but it doesn't seem to be getting better. I've tried deep breathing a few times (with variable success), and just being around people.

  
**A little background:**

All my life I've had a sweet tooth. Family has been riddled with diabetics.  
Played video games relentlessly throughout my formative years.  
Cared for as a child, but emotionally neglected. I don't blame my parents, but I know that has to have some effect.  
I've struggled with porn addiction (still do).  
My two closest friends are someone with tons of boundary issues (who I'm planning and terrified to move in with) and a self-proclaimed (he's right) narcissist. I'm doing my best to balance out expectations and boundaries there.  
I find that I use both to numb the pain, and every time I try to curb either, I'm riddled with anxiety and dread.  
Around 3 years ago, was dumped by my fiancee for another guy. Had a straight up panic attack on the drive to work, later that day. Ever since I've noticed myself mumbling more (not speaking up) and stuttering (new). I've since come to understand that I was creating a ""walkaway wife"" situation (not that I'm excusing her behavior either). But, I know my part in it.  
A few month after that, tried talking to random people on a random chat site (I didn't want to try a dating site, or look for anything serious). Met someone halfway across that world that didn't turn out to be a catfish. Fell in love again. Moved in with my parents to save for a move across the planet. She became insecure and controlling, I became cold and distant.  I broke it off soon after.  
A close friend/coworker ghosted me one day out of the blue. I confronted him about it, and I still don't understand it.  
I nearly destroyed a great relationship with my godfather.  
My world feels like it's closing in.  
I'm a people pleaser and tend to mirror most behaviors. I don't know what is me and what isn't.  


**I've done so much research already:**

Exercise, dieting, dating advice. I've looked into men's fashion, beard styling (not much point in trying with my head hair nowadays). Cutting out habits by forcing myself out of the house all day. I've tried brushing up on social etiquette. Researched how to talk to people. I've scoured TRP, poured through Ekhart Tolle's stuff, looked into anything I could get my hands on about talking to people.  
I seen psychologists (something I can't afford regularly).  
I'm only at peace when I play the piano, but I can't bring myself to do that at home.  


I rarely play video games anymore (I can't seem to find the will to). I just sit here, browsing random nonsense for hours on end.  


I know the actions steps I have to take. I can't organize them in my mind. It's always anxious. It's always foggy. I find myself doing things I hate. I find myself having deplorable thoughts.  


It's like I'm paralyzed by the fear of inaction.  


**Are there action steps I can take, to start taking action steps?**

  
**TLDR:** Have been experiencing increasing and long lasting episodes of anxiety all week. Wondering if its from cutting sugar, touch deprivation, etc. Also looking for free resources to start problem solving this out.",29Apr2019,1

It’s always been either/or (sometimes even in my good weeks, I’d feel down on sundays but that’s it). But now: 

Monday: felt like pure shit. Just tired of life, ashamed of myself, all the usual shit that comes with a down day for me

Tuesday-Saturday: felt great. Excited for the NFL draft, hung out with friends, went out with the family.

10," 

Today is April 28, 2019. I continue to go through highs and lows. The difference is that I can sometimes see a different alternative to my “view” on life in the area of parents to adult children. If you have been following my writings, you should know by now that I have been going through a psychotic break where I feel that I do not own my life. This meaning that I feel like, because my mom and dad literally gave me my life, and did indeed decide to raise me, that as such, they now completely own my life. My mom has been very narcissistic before, but now she is not as much. She really has changed quite a bit during the past 4 years. Anyways, my mom is actually not a monster in my opinion. She does have an attachment issue with me, but even she tries to support me in my mental health battle/healing. I ask her almost every day if I am in complete control of my being, my money, and my decisions. She always tells me yes, and I know she gets tired of repeating it. It’s just that for some goddamn reason, I always feel like I do not have the right to have ownership of my being, my money, or my decisions. I feel like because my parents gave me life, that they own my being (including my decisions and money) forever, and that there is no way I can repay my existence, so I am destined (doomed?) to be slaves to my parents.

This first started from the idea of the Judaeo/Abrahamic God. I was Christian, got deep into the religion, and decided that I was going to give my life to a God who was all-powerful, who deserved everyone’s worship, life, and devotion to him. At least, that’s the adjectives that religion uses to describe such God. In my opinion, other words similar but that paint an alternative picture of such God are: prideful, slave-owner, egotistical. If a God who is all mighty created us all, then there is no way that us, as puny little beings, could ever repay our existence to him, because the most we have is our existence. So if we give our being/life/worship/devotion to him, we become slaves, and at that point, we still cannot really repay our lives as we would have to continue to be eternal slaves to continually pay our existence for such God. I hope this kind of makes sense of the thoughts that plague and infect my brain every day for the past 3-4 years.

Earlier in this post, I mentioned that there is an alternative way of thinking that saves my sanity at times. Such way of thinking includes two ideas. The first gets the God issue out of the way. It is that first of all, through much research that I have done on the Judaeo/Abrahamic God, I come to the conclusion that such God does not exist, and that possibly no God exists. Also, as my mom has told me, even if he did exists, we would all be living under such dominion, and we can all share the burden of living under such rule, and know that I am not the only who thinks about this, and that whether such a God is good or bad, I will only know when I die. Now, the alternative thought to my parents always having authority and dominion over my life and being is that, simply, maybe I do own my life. That I do have control over my life, in a way where my parents do NOT have control over my being. That because I am me, I have authority over my own life, and they do not. My mom tells me that this is the truth, but I have no way of knowing which is true or not. I have trouble making sense of under what principle I should have authority and control over my own life, being, and money. I do not have a clear root understanding of whether the right thing is for my parents to forever have control over my life, or for me to have it. I don’t know what to base such concept from.

Anyways, I just wanted to get this of my chest today. Sorry if I sound crazy. I’m just want to be honest with someone else about my mental health issues. I feel goddamn lonely with such a weird issue that others don’t have trouble with.",29Apr2019,4
11,"made some posts yesterday about the state of my mental health, Im seeing a psychiatrist soon for the first time and I have major social anxiety and I’m not sure how I should go about this or what I should be expecting from this appointment. I understand that a psych and a therapist are two different things, I want to know if it’s acceptable for me to go in depth with what’s been going on like I would with my therapist to a psych? I don’t plan on giving this doc my life story but in my situation some context and explaining would probably be best to understand where I’m coming from I think. i think my situation is really strange and the progression of time and how it relates to my mental shit is really weird and rare and I just feel like it’s really hard to follow and I don’t want to seem like I’m lying or anything. Do I just list off all the symptoms I’ve been experiencing, or do I go on with the “it all started when I was 8-“ shtick ? I don’t want to waste anybodies time but I feel like if I just go in emotionlessly with a checklist of symptoms and then tack on “also I want to kill myself” at the end is kind of awkward. Is that even how a psych visit is supposed to go? I know I’m absolutely overthinking this because my SA is debilitating and I have really bad anxiety pangs in my stomach just thinking about going, but I really want to know what I should be expecting when I go to that appointment and what the proper etiquette is.",29Apr2019,0

I'll start by saying this one thing, it's almost as if I have what feels like two 'moods'. It's almost as if it is 'up' and 'down'. I say this first because everything after this will slot into one of them. I will describe them the best I can:

Up:

* Outgoing, willing to challenge my anxiety
* Talkative and funny
* Feel good about the future and the world around me
* Optimistic, thoughtful.
* Like being in public
* Like being the centre of attention
* Willing to bend the rules
* Don't want to talk about how I feel when I'm 'down'. Struggle to talk to a therapist.

Down:

* Anxious. This is when I can get muscle jerks, shaking hands and panic attacks in difficult situations.
* Quiet and kept to myself
* Existential Dread
* Can't talk to people
* Struggle with eye contact
* Don't like being seen in public
* Confidence issues
* Scared to be judged (won't talk in public)
* Don't like it when my social groups overlap. Like seeing a member of your family when you're with your friends, but the 'relative' might be from a hobby or something.
* Must. Follow. Rules.
* Don't take conflict well. Will often fight with my parents when confronted, it's my fault though
* Will talk to a therapist

These two 'moods' never overlap and change instantaneously. Periods may last hours to days, or in some cases, minutes.

Speak of the Devil, I've just switched now, I don't really want to write this post anymore cause I'm in a good mood! This is the problem though, I don't want to talk about this stuff when I'm like this! It made me hate therapy in the past, and likely what contributed to its limited effects. 

Ooh, another thing, when I do creative things, I'll often dislike my work from the other mood, so if I write a creative assessment for school when I'm 'up', I'll like it, but when I'm 'down' again, I'll hate it and think it's tacky, vice versa. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now this post has descended into chaos and disorder because of this switch half-way though, I'll call it here. What do I do though? I know there probably isn't much you can help me with because this post doesn't make much sense... Am I just being over-dramatic? Should I see someone about this? All the best.",29Apr2019,0

18,"So small backstory: I'm a 15 year old girl and currently in my sophomore year, in the 6th grade I was told I had both Anxiety and Depression after I started having panic attacks. 
I went to therapy sessions all my three years of middle school and stopped taking them in the middle of my freshman year because I started to honestly feel better. 
I was more social, higher energy, my panic attacks went from at least one a week to rarely having one. Then in the beginning of this year I started feeling worse. 
I've started to feel less active, I've been stress eating, I've been figgiting all the time. My memory has gone to shit, to the point where I forget something told to me just seconds ago and it takes a moment for me to remember it. I've been so uninterested in everything, where sometimes I don't do my homework. I've been distracted easily. I haven't been able to concentrate, using subtitles to watch shows to help me with the plot or having to reread a passage in a book because I don't remeber what i just said. The worst is that I can't cry. I've been feeling so many emotions lately and usually I use crying to help me let it out. However, I haven't been able to do that lately. 
All of this has made me want to stay in bed and not go to school or anywhere (which ive done a few times), it's been effecting my school and social life, and its made me feel like crap all the time. 
I'm thinking about going back to therapy and I'm not sure of what else to do. Could anyone give me any advice?",29Apr2019,0
19,"First of all, I hope this is in the right subreddit.

I feel like I get jealous and angry at my girlfriend so easily and over such little things. Most of this, I think, is connected to my low self-esteem. I don't want to be ""that"" boyfriend, but I always get a sick feeling in my stomach when she has fun without me. I feel like she will forget about me, meet other people, or something like that. Very little things like her talking to her friends and family when I'm not included or her going out without me (with her family OR friends). This includes when she goes on family vacations during the summer. I am anxious when she goes to the gym without me to play badminton with her friends. I need to text her all day every day and if I don't I start to get scared or worry about what she is doing. 

I can't help but hate it when she listens to K-pop or watches Korean dramas and thinking she finds the singers or actors attractive. It makes me feel inferior and wish I was better looking. One store we like to go to to study started playing k-pop, and since then I always get nervous or sick when I'm in the store. 

A lot of our fights or arguments have been centered around my insecurities and I am well aware of how irrational I am and how this is not normal. It's something I've been struggling with and really want to fix. 

I told her about my insecurities and my problems and she has been so helpful and supportive of me and I love her so much for sticking by me, but its been starting to have a toll on our relationship. We have more and more fights and she keeps saying I need to change my ways or she'll leave. I've been really sad many times that our relationship is the way it is because of how I am and it makes me hate myself and want to end my life. 

I'm looking into psychologists to talk to, but in the meantime, I just want to hear what you guys have to say... has anyone had a problem similar to mine? How did you get over it? I am wondering what ways there are feel less bad when things like this happen.",29Apr2019,0
20,"**I've had issues with anxiety and depression all of my life,** so I'm asking this question with sympathy. 

At age 11 or 12 I tried cutting myself. I did it for about a year. Looking back, I  realize it was kind of an attention thing-- a cry for help that sadly, my parent never addressed. Luckily, it didn't become an addiction. Now, I have several other somewhat destructive self-soothing behaviors, but cutting isn't one of them. It was never something that made me feel better-- it just hurt me. 

I'm a graduate student and as I've been facing some of my own mental health issues, I've become more outspoken about it within my cohort (60% of grad students at my uni are depressed). So, I want to understand other people's mental health as well.

I want to feel better, but my skin gets goosebumps every time I look up.. what do I do? Who can help me? Somebody please help me? No, don’t... I know I won’t make it for too long. Maybe another 5 - 10 years... My heart will collapse, I can feel it... Who is going to burry me? Some government agency? Non profit for homeless people? Nobody is even going to know when I die? Nobody will notice. Nobody because I don’t have anyone. I had a person once, long time ago... I trusted my heart and my destiny.. it broke me. I thought I was damaged before, and yes I was in the way but it never stoped or hold me back. It never could defined me, but this.... broke me for real. I’m not damaged anymore, but broken and to repair this will take a lot of time and work. How long? Maybe 10 years? I can’t imagine myself damaged again, I see broken and lost girl who is willing to try her best to heal and feel better. I let this happen, I opened myself, I let my vulnerable side out to face the world... I don’t regret it for a moment because I felt what true love and passion is.. I felt my body and heart being full and that can never be taken away, the memories I made will stay with me ♾. 
I feel better after writing this, I feel some sun on my cheeks.. I am freezing cold tho and nothing seems to make me feel comfortable. I am tired of fighting and feeling... especially feeling. It sucks to hurt so deeply when others just get a craze of it... why am I so vulnerable and easy to get hurt? Is my sensitivity my dark curse? I feel so deeply for others, for myself, for the world.... Fuck. I hate myself. I promised myself to work through this one day at a time, one moment at a time. Don’t think about tomorrow, don’t worry about the future. Let go of the past, let of yesterday. The only thing matters is this moment, this present minute and how you live through it. This too shall pass... This shall too pass.. You are strong, beautiful, and brave. Don’t let your thoughts control your day. It can make you brake down, don’t fight it. Accept the darkness and pick up the pieces to build yourself up and stronger than before. You can do it! I believe in you! I believe in myself!",29Apr2019,1

26,"My SO and I both have struggled with long term depression anxiety. For the most part of our relationship it’s been very much about supporting SO and I’ve just coasted along in a functioning apathetic daze regarding fixing myself.

I’ve gotten to a point where at times where I should be supporting him I’ve been getting apathetic and angry (e.g. when he takes a day off work, instead of support I go into stress mode thinking that he’s gonna get fired for so many sick days etc etc). I feel like a really shitty person for not just loving him at these times, but it’s so hard especially when the weight of “adulting” lies on my shoulders.

Don’t wanna get into too much more information, just looking for some advice on how to support a struggling SO when you yourself also suffer? He even said to me today “if you can’t support me then just don’t”. That’s not what a relationship is about...

We both already have professional support so please don’t tell me to do that, and no we are not breaking up. Just looking for advice from anyone else’s experience.

I’m very new to Reddit, I came on here as a way to vent and maybe get some opinions on what I should do. I work in management(but in the restaurant field so I have no insurance, woo!) and am very close with my staff, as they are basically my only friends, but I don’t feel comfortable addressing what’s going on with me due to our work relationship. Not close with family either. 
Lately I feel like I am just coming undone. I feel terrified to leave my home, there’s a constant underlying fear that I am going to be killed while in my car, or someone is going to slit my throat from behind or something while I’m out and about. At the same time I’m terrified of being in my home, as now I feel paranoid that someone is going to break in and violently murder me. My dreams are all focused around my death. I think of taking my own life very often, usually as a way to ensure I never have to think about anything ever again. 
I have never had therapy or anything like that, and I’m unsure of how to even start that or find one that’s good for what’s wrong with me? As I stated earlier I don’t have insurance. 
Anyone have any tips or experiences like this? Any suggestions on what steps to take? 
I’m also trying to avoid being committed to a mental hospital  at all costs.",29Apr2019,0
31,"I'm not sure what to do.. I'm in a situation where someone I really care about and who is the only family I've ever had my entire life is going through so much and I feel like it's dragging me down to the pits of hell with him. 

We lost our only parent at very young ages in our teenage years and were tossed around the foster system like rag dolls and both got into serious relationships that failed and left us bankrupt. We've had one thing after another for years that have emotionally and mentally crippled us both. We are both homeless right now staying at a friend's house trying to get back on our feet. 

But recently things have gotten even worse. I am someone who has accepted the past. I have chosen not to let the things that I can't control ruin what I have right now and am actively trying to improve myself and my life because I have come to the decision and made peace with the fact that the only thing that I can control is myself. I suffer from depression and anxiety and probably a lot of other undiagnosed things, but I know in my heart that I can control one day at a time. What I do in this moment is mine even if it's hard. 

This person I care about however is suffering so much and so deeply. He has lost himself in the past and in the trauma and in his anxiety. To him, everything is the fault of the people and events that have put us here. Things that are completely out of our control. He can not let it go and it consumes him on the daily. Although I feel like he realizes it's out of his control, but can't actively convince himself or find the strength to get through this. These past few weeks have gotten so bad for him as he's recently started having severe panic attacks and anxiety. To the point where he needs me to reassure him 40,000 times a day that he's not going to die. That things in the future will be different from the past, that he's not going to lose anyone else. That he will be happy and that things will be okay. 

Normally I would love to be here for him, to reassure him 40'000 times a day if need be. To tell him everything is going to be okay and that he will get through this. However, I increasingly find myself frustrated and drained emotionally. Unable to reassure him of those things he asks me to reassure him with without telling him he has the power to get through this. He usually gets really upset when I give him any kind of advice on how to help himself when he comes to me. Saying nobody understands him, he's in constant fear and can't do those things. It somehow becomes this cycle that I can't break and I've found that I can't fix it for him. I'm feeling so emotionally drained and trying to think positive and do things for myself to feel good and do good for myself, but I see him suffering and feel selfish. 

I know that I can't control what he does or feels, but this person is important to me and the only person in this world who I don't want to ever live without. 

I want to know how to help him, without feeling like I'm giving all of me and all of my time to him. All of my energy on making sure myself is okay is gone if I am there in the way he needs me to be, but he's having trouble. I'm not sure what to do.

He's my brother and I want him to have a good life just as much as I want myself to, but I'm starting to feel like I can't have both.

Does anyone know what would be a good thing to do in this situation? How to encourage someone without giving all of yourself. How to help someone who is feeling constant fear and like they are alone. Someone who needs 40'000 reassurances a day and has severe panic attacks and feels like they are going crazy because of how much emotional stress and despair they are going through?

I want to take care of both of us in the proper way. Is there even a way to healthily do that?

Any advice that anyone can offer would be so much appreciated! Thank you!",29Apr2019,1
32,"Dear geniuses of Reddit (the best social media by far):
This will get pretty weird pretty fast. But I need to ask someone because I swear to god I can't let myself continue like this.

I'll probably also swear a bit. So expect a lot of grawlixes.

This is a sexual problem stemming from a mental problem too... But I couldn't see a sexual one so have fun having a confused face all day. Nothing illegal. Just weird.

Basically. I'm an autoplushophiliac. It just kind of happened over time. Got bullied throughout primary, awkward teen with small freind group through secondary. Loner through college (2 years here in the UK) and now I'm at a point where I can choose to go to uni.

As times been going on though I've realised more and more why I'm doing what I'm doing. I work in the theatre. Where's the one place you can garuntee animal costumes? The theatre... It's gotten to a point where I think my college class knows. And these are not nice people. If they do know (which again I highly expect they do) then they will tell literally everyone at every uni and theatre going and I will never live it down. I've worn animal costumes in public before and lent them out to people too... So people know I've got them, and they also know I'm at bit weird... So there's that...

But there's a darker side to all this @#£&amp;. I do indeed own animal costumes. How many? Almost £3000's worth. In fact probably more by now. All but two have been... Well... Used let's say... Only 1 has been altered and they range from cheap onesies all the way up to £1500 custom mascots (bought used) and a custom fursuit (made by a close freind. Again nothing telling on it exactly and as with everything it had an excuse for existing). I have spent so much now I'm in thousands of pounds debt to family and have had to miss out on getting things I actually need. And then it hit me. I'm working in this industry to keep around costumes. I'm pretty certain of it. I was helping a group get all their stuff out after a show yesterday and somebody jokingly put the dog head they used on me (it was in the way so it was just a joking about with mates thing. I know for a fact nobody there knows about this whole fluffy mess) and it's stuck in my head ever since. I can't forget about it. That's when I realised I'm just here to keep near @#£&amp;+*"" animal costumes. Don't get me wrong I'm good at the work. I'm not an actor so is never wear a costume for a show so there's no problem there and I'd never do anything with someone else's property, plus those two clean ones are my only public ones and I don't even wear them myself, I lend them out.

I worked out a while ago I probably started this fetish since as a kid I had no friends, and the only things that I felt safe around were cartoons like scooby doo or books like redwall. So I guess the fetish came from talking animals being the only nice thing in my life. Finding out about furries on Russel Howard and seeing ylvis the fox where the ones that proper set me off down the path. I guess being alone currently at college and at work just keeps it fueled. Don't get me wrong I'm not hated, but I don't really have any friends either. I have one but she's a bit of a @#£&amp; to be honest, she insults people, complains like a soccer mom to retail employees and is basically just a chav overall, but I take what I've got. At least it's someone. :3

The problem is I just keep spending and its destroying me emotionally and alienating me from people. I keep trying to lend my friends animal costumes as I know if I see one I don't have I'm going to want to buy it. There's so many animal based shows around here (I live in the south of England, any more specific and somebody will work out who I am, it's a tight but industry) that it's becoming impossible to avoid, so by lending my work and my college my clean accessories and costumes I don't get an urge to buy them. Which is good since I know exactly what will happen if I do [buy them].

My question is, what can I do. If I go to uni I have been offered a place in the top one nearby me but I know full well if I go, that's it, I'm stuck in the industry so I'll need to sort out stopping the fetish, but on the other hand if I quit I have nothing to fall back on. I'd have to work retail.

I've tried asking charities like that kids one we have here (saw them advertised at my school. They seemed like they where helping at first but it was an obvious tick box organisation) and I've asked my GP (who gave me a number for a free local counselled (govt. Run) who told me to ask the GP... You can see where that's going) so I'm out of ideas. 

I'm also really sorry if this is confusing at all. It's really hard to try and hide my identity as it's such a small community I can't even say what kind of animals I own. Saying about that dog was a push in itself...

TL;DR; I am sexually interested in animal costumes but it's putting so much stress on my social and work lives im having to cry myself to sleep at night cuddling a plush toy even though legally I'm old enough to drink alcohol... if I don't deal with it by either changing career (I think I started this career path as I like what I'm working with (not costumes... Can't say what, just a theatre job) and I get to be near animal costumes) or somehow stopping this stupid, stupid fetish I will end up killing myself. I've already attempted multiple times in my past (not overly recently) and ran away from home (again, not overly recently, both less than 5 years ago though) but I don't want to be that kid. I don't want to put the burden of my death on my family.  I want to actually do something to make people happy that doesn't as a side effect involve me coming home and cumming in a fluffy costume... It's absolutely ridiculous and it literally makes no fudging sense...


By the way... If you screenshot this to send your mate Carl down the pub to laugh at over the footy can you at least press f?



(I should also mention I cope with my shitty situation with memes and sugar and crying at night).




None of this is a joke. I'm being completely serious. Well I'm trying to anyway. I just want to get my @#£&amp;*"""" life together. :-(

 I greatly empathised i wanted a diagnosis to conquer this paradox of what i really have, he kept insisting treatment, which i feel is good, and correct but he seems to lack empathy, he lacks empathy to see how much a diagnosis would mean. On the phone he kept telling me ''mate'' almost as if he was trying to be assertive but was a fucking dick, maybe i am really crazy or he is gaslighting me. He has tried to get me to admit things i don't want to admit like trying to convince me somehow what he did was warranted like cancelling on me, and somehow how i also need to take responsibility. 

I feel like he may be a Narcissist, and this is a war, a game where he wants to beat me at my own game or i want to beat him, there is tension and the aura is missing. Either we just aren't connecting, or he has exposed me for what i truly want and feel, at the same time he also comes off like some dickhead by his voice, i always need to 2ndd guess myself as he tells me it is in ''my head'' and he completely did not have such motive, i feel this gut feeling.

 There was this lady who wanted to be my Psychologist but she quit the service for some reason, when me and her talked over the phone i felt really connected, cared for, i felt she was LGTBIQ friendly, while this therapist was condescending and at once said there are only 2 genders before quickly reverting.

 I've always had this issue with stainless steel metal spoons ever since I can remember. I've only started to notice it recently as it grew a little more intense over the years. When I am doing dishes and I have a pair of metal spoons freshly washed they sometimes end up clanking against one another and it gives me a really weird sensation in my mouth (specifically my teeth, I know, weird). And I have an intense urge to bite on them? But I just put them away.
Also when I eat anything that requires me to use the metal spoons after I am done eating I LOVE to gnaw on my spoon. The sound of the metal clanking against my teeth and the coldness of the spoon and the taste of the metal rubbing on my teeth just gives me SUCH an asmr feeling. 
Am I weird? Whats wrong with me and why do I do this? I've had this feeling as a kid but I'm only starting to notice now as an adult and I'm growing more concerned as to why it happens. I tried to google it but all I could find was babies do this sometimes when they are teething as the cold spoon feels good on their gums. I'm in my 20's so I'm pretty sure I'm not teething.

35,"I’d love some advice here, Reddit. I’ve been dating my BF for about a year/year and a half. He has always been wonderful, an absolute pleasure to spend time with. He has always made me feel loved, communicated, and was patient and caring. 

For the past month or so he has been feeling incredibly tired. He skipped out on work all last week and has been feeling ‘sick’ (all from what he says, none of these symptoms are visible to anyone else but himself) 

Yesterday I had a family get together that he attended. I had numerous family members come up to me and ask if he was drunk, but he only had a half of one of those truely seltzer’s. He would be rambling and mumbling to whomever he had a conversation with. He met a few people for the first time and I was later told ‘he seems super nice, but damn he talks a lot.’ But he was never like this! He has also started twitching, like when he’s in bed he will randomly pick his leg up and drop it down. He moans a lot when he’s trying to sleep, and he has been flicking his thumb off of his finger. It’s hard to describe, but he doesn’t notice he has been doing it. 

Watching GoT tonight he was constantly talking, mumbling, and twitching. When we went to bed, I let him know how I really wanted to go to sleep because I wake up very early. He kept twitching and moaning and I offered to sleep on the couch. (My couch is super comfortable, I sleep there a lot when he doesn’t sleep over my house) but he didn’t want me to. He tried to snuggle up to me to stop the twitching because I pointed it out, but he was crowding me a lot to where my hip was hanging off the bed, so I asked for a little space, and he accused me of hating him and went off. Now he went to the couch (I’m kind of bummed, I wanted to sleep there) but the couch is way too small for him. I hear him having a full blown conversation with himself, morning, and dropping his foot on the ground repeatedly.

The first type I experience is when I'm actually fine, my mind is in a relaxed and normal state, yet people think there's something wrong with me because they misjudge my body language.



Unfortunately I have a resting bitch face, so it doesn't help my case on top of that I get annoyed when people do this since get defensive when people assume I have an attitude when I don't which is pretty dumb to get mad at.



The other is when I feel extremely awkward or don't know how to proceed in a situation and I'm more quite and reserved, and I act bitchy when people try to Interact with me since I start to think everyone's a jerk because my anxiety is telling me they're judging me.

I've been navigating the mental health care system for years now, getting psychiatric and emergency help when I can (it's been a long time coming). I've been formally diagnosed with several conditions (\*\*BPD, PTSD, general anxiety and panic disorder) and I felt like I was finally getting a grip on the half of it. I have been receiving various treatments (meds, DBT, therapy, regular psychiatry) ((thank god for Canadian healthcare)) and have had to go through hell to get where I was

 (in a relatively stable state, taking care of myself as best as I could)

&amp;#x200B;

through a chaotic weekend and some immense panic, I ended up being involuntarily brought into hospital last weekend by a friend. She was worried about me. I felt ok. I had been in psych many times and felt like I was in a good enough headspace to advocate for myself, then shit hit the fan.

I was kept for four days against my will and kept on a form one.  the hospital treated me like shit, that's another story though. 

before being discharged the possible diagnosis of Bipolar disorder came up. The doctor who was dealing with my case was almost certain that I had experienced a period of mania and subsequently told me that my medical history was congruent with the disorder. I haven't been processing this well

Mania was always something I had thought of in the back of my head, anytime I felt a slight euphoria following a depressive slump. I was terrified to consider it as a possibility because that meant something separate that I wasn't ready for and feel like I can't handle. 

reconciling with this in such a vulnerable state has been near impossible. I couldn't talk about this coherently to any of the staff, I just told them what I could and never took in what they were saying about another diagnosis. They referred me to several people specializing in youth with Bipolar disorder and the talked about possible treatment: then I went home on Friday.

I go to a Catholic school that takes discipline very seriously, so if you're late 3 times for any reason, you get a detention. During the entirety of elementary and middle school, I was late *every single day*. It sucked. Luckily, that changed when I went to high school, but she still cuts it close.

44,"I've had PTSD for about two years. It stemmed from an incident where I saw I house burn down and someone inside couldn't get out, many were minutes away from not making it out with their lives. A friend that made it out came out told me all the horrific details, how he was moments away from being incinerated, seeing how he looked covered in ashes and burns. Ever since, I have had this weird paranoia about fire.

I had another incident a few months later where the fuel line in my car broke and it nearly exploded. I still remember vividly the feeling of the gasoline fumes slowly pulling me under and how I almost met Death that day. 

Every time I leave my house for 5 minutes, I expect it not to be there when I come back. I'm serious. When I leave for hours, I get distracted while I'm out just thinking ""my house may be burning down right now.""

I am super OCD about unplugging everything as soon as I'm done with it and when I leave. This is probably completely unfounded and is statistically a waste of time in terms of preventing a fire. I used to be awake for hours in bed paranoid that the house is burning down or someone is breaking in at every little sound. 

I had a broken fire alarm which would go off every other morning for god knows what reason. Which is great for someone with PTSD, I love waking up all the time in the morning nearly having a f\*cking heart attack. One day I couldn't get it to turn off, I was all alone, there was obviously no smoke or fire inside. I started pacing, having an anxiety attack, I started to hallucinate smells things that were just my imagination, in which, I called 911. I was crying my eyes out, having a breakdown on the front lawn.  This happened a second another time with another false alarm.

The water heater in our house runs off of propane, but I refuse to use it because it gives me nightmares and paranoia that there will be a gas leak and I will never wake up or some explosion.

48,it’s hard to feel like living is meaningful because typical arguments like “leaving a legacy” don’t matter to me. I believe that once you’re dead your conscious dies too so you’ll never know what type of legacy you left and it wouldn’t mean anything anyway because you would never know. sometimes i think most of us live because it’s not that bad to be alive and killing ourselves seems overdramatic. i don’t actively want to die right now but this pit in my stomach is growing when i think about how much nothing matters in a few thousand years we’ll all be gone and forgotten. is this supposed to be liberating? am i supposed to feel free to do whatever i please?,29Apr2019,1

My biological dad was a hardcore drug addict who beat my mom all the time in front of us and other stuff so abuse is in the air already but I’m not sure if sexual was. (I haven’t seen him in  about 10 years now I’m 18) 

Later years on my older sister admitted to waking up with him on her when she was 5-7 years old I am a year younger than her I wish I had exact dates but trauma blurred it. 

I can’t remember most my childhood but I remember acting out sexually and always being terrified. I remember having the most painful feeling in my groin and having horrendous pee infections that felt like hell on earth and being terribly embarrassed about it.  around the age of 4-5. I remember the constant fear I was in. 

I sexually acted out with other kids not knowing where I learned the stuff from I acted out sexual things with anything I could. when I was like 5 I remember putting some object into myself and crying and running to my mom cause it was bleeding. She did nothing I remember. I always tried being sexual with everything. I never spoke to anyone as a child and became mute from the immense trauma I had gone through. 

I grew up to have the classic things after an abusive childhood, running away, getting kicked out of schools, substance abuse, food issues in and out of psych wards from ages 12-16. I’m still evolving but the idea my own father was sexually abusing me my childhood haunts me every now and then. 

My mom suggested years and years later when my sister admitted to it maybe he drugged us and did it. It makes me think she knows more than she lets on.

58,"On March 31st, a person who I called a very close friend blew up at me after months of not talking to me, responding to me venting about how I missed him. He had been ignoring every message i sent him since the year began, and I didn't know why. He sent me this:
""Do you not know how to take no for an answer??""
""Don't ask my friends about me, and if you text my sister about this shit I'm going to fucking lose it. You clearly don't fucking get how angry I am right now so take a fucking note.
Leave. 
Me. 
Alone.""
""You've had plenty of chances. 
You're the first person I've blocked in years.""
""So get the message. Don't interact with me. You make me unhappy. You make me anxious. You make me feel guilty for fucking existing.""
""People like you are the reason I can't hold relationships for more than a month before breaking down in anxiety and isolating.""
""Go. Away.""
""don't text me again.""
I broke down after receiving this message. Me and my former friend have been friends for a year. I met him on a furry community online, he's 21, I'm 17. We talked a lot, and found we lived very close to each other. We met at my job at an ice cream store, and we began hanging out a lot. We went to an amusement park, a medieval festival, food places and more. We've RP'd a lot too. He had gotten me gifts as I had gotten him stuff, and we both played games together and talked a lot. He supported me when my stepmom was diagnosed with colon cancer, and when I was suffering with my moms awful boyfriend. He was my best friend, and he knew a lot about me.
I tried my best to be as supportive as I could. He meant the world to me, next to my own boyfriend who lives in Alabama. I would talk to him often, make him art, try to make him happy and more. He began being inactive, and I didn't know why, but I learned it was because december and those months reminded him about his father, since his father passed away from cancer around that time.
He said he would return, and he did for a bit, then he disappeared again. And.. I still messaged him, in hopes he would return. I would tell him what was happening, and I missed him, but he didn't answer. I vented to him sometimes, but i deleted the messages because I felt bad. It lasted until march. And.. me and him have argued before, but we moved on. But now.. I'm scared.
I don't know what to do. I haven't been able to sleep tonight. I don't know what I did wrong. I keep thinking, and thinking, back to every moment. I don't know what I've done to make him so anxious. He was always so happy with me. i always thought I made him feel better, like after the time when he first hung out with me, and when he went home his tire blew out and he was having a panic and i talked him through it. I always thought he liked being with me. What did I do wrong?
I'm doing my best to move on. I really am. But it hurts so much, since he was such a big part of my life, he was such a motivator. 
From what I know, his mom isn't aware, but I don't know about his sister. 
Is this my fault? Was I not enough? Was I too much? Should I keep waiting to try to fix things, or is it better to move on? I.. don't know what to do anymore. Please help me. I just wanted to make everyone happy, I don't know how to deal with this.",29Apr2019,0

lately it seems like when I talk to people... they become ignorant... very simply said. An example would be like this... Person A says ""how you feeling today?"" and Person B says back ""dont worry about it"". 

&amp;#x200B;

on a small scale it may seem like hey, some people have bad days. on the scale I am living on now... I cant talk to a single person in my life anymore... I am completely sheltered and alone. Literally today I have not opened my mouth to talk to a single person because they always reply with something ignorant. 

&amp;#x200B;

contrary to this problem... I have also noticed in most situations, Person B can talk to other people with respect all day long, but when I (Person A) try to talk, I keep getting ignorant replies.

this is becoming a major ongoing factor in my mental health as I am already battling with Schizoid Personality Disorder, Anxiety, Depression, and PTSD (among many other physical disabilities)

66,"Hey again, I've posted here a couple of times now, things are still shit. The problem that I'm having is that I'm constantly thinking that my friends (only have a few) are sick of me still being depressed. This has mainly been because of the fact that they have not really been responding to my texts and if they do its normally just a short blunt reply. But when I have talked to them prior they always said I could contact them any time I was feeling low (I dont contact them a lot as I dont really like burdening people). So idk what to do, I have been bad over this last week or so and really just needed to talk to a friend but havent been able to. I just dont want to lose any of my friends as I dont have many and I've already been finding myself to be quite isolated. I know that one of them doesnt understand what I'm going through but has still tried to be supportive but I think they get a bit frustrated when to them things seems so obvious. Like suggesting that I just stop thinking negatively all the time and that I should just get a job (even though at the min I'm struggling to even look after myself properly with eating, getting out of bed etc).

Then the other thing is that when they say positive things about me, to me, my mind always just casts doubt to whether what they said is something they actually meant or whether they were just saying it to try to make me feel better about myself. 

With both of these things idk whether it's just my anxiety and depression just making my mind over think things. At the min I just feel like I want to break down and cry constantly and cut my arm.

69,"Is it common to be prescribed antidepressants without being advised to stop drinking?

I have more than one friend who is alcoholic and taking prescribed antidepressants. (I don't know which specific meds are involved.) At least two friends are making no attempt to change their lifestyles or reduce alcohol consumption which seems plainly odd to me.

My own struggles with alcoholism and my own observations regarding its effects on my mood lead me think alcoholism is probably the main factor driving my own struggles with mental health.

Why would anyone attempt to address a mental health issues without first getting sober?   

Why would anyone think they could medicate their mental health while keeping an addiction?

I suppose the act of taking pills is a lot easier than working towards sobriety.

Can antidepressant medication be effective in the midst of an alcohol addiction?

I'm not trying to cure anyone else here. I'm not looking for medical advice. I don't have anything against taking medication if there is hope of it being effective. I am concerned my friends may be self-sabotaging their efforts to get well without appreciating the effects of alcohol have on mental health.

70,"I’m a 22 year old male who is a senior in college. I have a substance abuse disorder and believe I have NPD.

Drugs, alcohol and narcissism. I feel like these things feed into each other in a terrible way. It starts when I take drugs and alcohol to be more effectively narcissistic in social situations. Drugs and alcohol heighten my ego when I use them. Over time as I feel more narcissistic I get more reckless with drugs and alcohol. Abusing them more and in more dangerous situations. Why? Because I obviously can handle it and won’t fuck up. 

Eventually I fuck up, i.e. getting arrested, over dosing, getting fired. When this happens my ego comes crashing down with my world. At the very end of that fall I become depressed and hopeless. At first I think “Maybe I’m not actually special or superior and because of that I don’t have the ability to recover from this and my life is over.” I may contemplate suicide at this point.

But as I slowly start to recover from the fall my narcissism begins to show itself again. As I regain hope my mindset changes, “I am special, but I’m waisting my potential.” Gradually my ego builds as the fall seems further away. This process can be escalated through lying in therapy (especially group) and participating heavily in social and intellectual discussions. Eventually my ego grows enough and I break sobriety.

Unless I change, this will repeat itself until one day I die. Either from reckless drug / alcohol abuse or because I crash so hard that my ego can’t get me through depression and I end it all.

I thought I’d share my self analyses. Maybe someone else can relate. I’ve been to solo and group therapy about 25 times total. It’s always been court ordered. I’ve always lied or unconsciously used it to practice manipulation. I’m finally going to try and tell the truth. Hopefully I can break this vicious cycle and stop it from taking my life.

I'm an 18 year old student about to do my A Levels (that's APs for any American reading this) in the next weeks and for quite a while, I've been feeling quite stressed as these are the exams that'll get me into University or not.

Now I'm somebody who is always skittish, I'm afraid to try and offend anyone and I'm constantly getting worked up over the slightest of things, it's a terrible habit that I'm trying to break but nothing really seems to be working. I lack in a lot of self-confidence and I'm always putting myself down, leaving me with social anxiety, which I've had for a while but I feel it's worsened.

As well as that, I'm somebody who doesn't have a lot of friends, but the one's I do have hardly ever acknowledge me. I do different exams compared to them all (they do exams like Physics and Maths where I'm doing stuff like Psychology and English). Because of this, I hardly ever see them during the day and even when I do, it sometimes feels like they pretend I'm not even there, when I sit down with them, they never say hi and just keep playing their games on their phones (games that which I'm not particularly interested in) and because of all this, it's resulted in me effectively isolating myself, and there's no really else I can go to because no-one else seems to really care about me, so every single day, I'm on my own with no-one to talk to, miserable as all sin and just wishing to be out of there.

Now up until recently, my stress seems to have gotten worse, it's built up to such a level where I've just given up, I don't want to revise and practice anymore and I lose all motivation to do anything, even the things I used to enjoy I look at with hatred. I had a feeling for a while that it may be due to me having S.A.D because this has happened twice before, both at Christmas, but this feeling has still lingered. I tried going to a counsellor for a while but it did nothing and sometimes I even wonder what's the point.

78,"Hello everyone, I need help/advice figuring out what is wrong with me and what i should do about it.

Im going to give some background on myself to help figure out whats wrong.
* Male, Currently 23
* Unemployed (Never had a real job)
* No exercise at all (I barely even leave my room)
* Very low variety diet (I have been eating the same meals every day for around the past 3 - 4 years)
* Diagnosed with Aspergers and ADD
* Anxiety problems my whole life

I think that should be enough, Please ask for more information if you need it.


For the past 3 - 4 years my mental health has deteriorated but the past 5 - 4 months something got worse.
Its hard to explain but over the years i would occasionaly expierence this feeling of not being in full control of my mind (I feel very spacey if thats a word), Well after doing research i came across this thing called Brain Fog which sounded pretty similar to what i was expierencing and it was reccomended to try taking Omega-3 supplements which i started taking and they did clear up the problem slightly so i put the problem at the back of my mind and kept doing the same thing everyday. (This problem would occasionly pop up every now and then for the past few years but i was in wierd state of denial so i pretty much ignored it)


But around 5 - 4 months ago it got alot worse and now i expierence this all day everday, I have no idea why it got worse since i wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary for it to happen.
It feels so much stronger now, My mind does not feel like its all there, I don't actually feel like im concious and im in a dream.
Im frequently losing my train of thought and expierencing daydreaming but without dreaming (Its like my mind just stops all thoughts and blankly stares at a wall or something)
My vision also feels more narrow and i sometimes go crossed eyed, The opticians have said my eyes are healthy.


Its affecting everything i do since its much harder to think straight now, I spend most of time playing video games and im notably worse at the same games ive been playing for years, My mind just cant keep up with stuff i use to do.
I don't know if this problem is due some physical problems with my body or if its all in my head, Either way something is wrong.
After attempting some research most people would say im depressed or stressed but in all honesty before this problem occured i never really felt stressed or depressed, Ive always been a calm/passive person.
However because of this problem i have been feeling upset and some stress because im confused and scared about what i should do.


I should add that i started ADD medication about a month ago, My ability to focus has been crappy all my life and these meds have helped a little, However im still feeling this problem all the time and my meds are the only reason i can get up in the morning.
For anyone interested i am on Lisdexamphetamine 30mg, I take a pill each morning.
I have access to free healthcare so i know i should see a doctor but i see them so often about other problems that i dont want to bother them anymore.


Please im in desperate need for help, I feel like crying because this is frustrating.

85,"I have always been unconfident in my social ability, and obsessed with my mistakes I make around other people since middle school. In middle school I would be very emotional and show my feelings after making these tiny ""socially unacceptable"" mistakes, but I learned to control it in high school and made a complete 180; I refused to show emotion to another human being because showing emotion = bad. I covered up any time I would be upset with humor, but still completely fixated on every little thing I said. When I got my first girlfriend as a senior, I would grade myself on our dates and think about it for the next hour if I stuttered while talking or god forbid said something that was incorrect. Anytime someone got upset with me or accused me of being rude, I was convinced that they now hated me. All I can focus on is my mistakes, and I worry/convince myself that others only fixate on my mistakes as well.

I have an extreme lack of confidence. The thing I saw online about speaking to classmates before algebra class made a lot of sense - how the fuck am I supposed to pull words out of thin air? How do some people have the ability to just talk to other people without obsessing over every detail of their dialogue or being concerned about having a justifiable reason to talk? When I first asked my now best friend in college if he wanted to go to a laser show, I made four drafts of my text because I was so fixated on not looking dumb with my speech. Fortunately, he and his roommate are now the people at college that I'm closest to and I can believe that every little thing I do doesn't chip away at their liking me (with my girlfriend from high school, I was convinced that there was a mistake or social miscue limit before I stopped being attractive and every instance lessened her impression of me).",29Apr2019,1

A family member attempted suicide last week, lucky they survived (some how) and I was wondering how long they would be signed off work? Would they receive full pay as well? We suspect they had an episode of mania which ended in them trying to kill themselves, it was more bipolar rather than a depression as they were very high leading up to the event and wasn't low. They have a long history of depression so this was new to us when it was happing , as they were so happy (Oddly happy looking back on). They have comedown now and seem to be rationally thinking again and are worried about pay etc which is the last thing they need. They will be contacting there union rep soon, as they are part of one, but I just wanted to get some info before they did as I can't seem to find much (UK).

88,"Hello everyone!

So nearly two years ago I was done wrong and dirty by a few “friends” who I took in at different times. I helped to get them both jobs, paid their rent, bought them things they wanted or needed, and paid for all their food. Things didn’t work out once I asked one to pay rent, and the other to stop stealing and be more hygienic. 

Now the two are friends and living in the same town as me- forcing me to see them on a weekly basis since i work at the only mall in town. Whenever I see them I just get angry and hurt and think about what they both did to me, and I wonder how can you be happy with yourself and with your life knowing you hurt someone else? 

How do I stop obsessive angry thoughts about these individuals?  Sometimes even when I am not working I find my thoughts on the subject of them and it’s not healthy! How do I distract myself? Taking a walk, tv, even video games don’t seem to take my mind off of these jerks. Therapy is also expensive even with insurance etc etc. but perhaps there is an at home trick to IDGAF?

93,"It’s a bit of a rant, and honestly, some of you people here might think I may be abnormal. I don’t know. I just feel that I’m not.

Straight up, I have tendencies that aren’t really socially acceptable. I write bestiality porn, and have achieved orgasm to all types of bestiality stuff- written, animated, and real (videos). I think I also have faunoiphilia, which is essentially arousal from watching animals fuck each other. At least, I *think* I do, judging from the fact that I did masturbate to animals having sex. I can’t really be sure. Those types of videos are easy on YouTube anyway, often posted by breeders. But I digress.

Thing is, people are quick to tell me that I’m sexually attracted to animals. I’m not. I don’t feel I am. I just get aroused by imagining having sex with them, but that doesn’t mean I’m attracted to them. Idk what it is that I like about animal sex stuff. Some people might say I’m into domination-submission to the extreme, or that I like pet-play which is basically what I said before. But I don’t like kinks like that. I just see it as normal sex... just not with humans. I don’t like creepy extreme domination. 

I’ve asked other people who enjoy beast porn (where pretty girls fuck animals, for example)why they like it, and the answer is usually that they like watching a hot girl getting plowed. But I’m never attracted to those girls. Just the animal junk. And I only like watching animals fuck each other because it’s pretty basic sex. Same with bestiality porn. Animals are just a different... flavor. 

I’m not mentally ill, but it gets kind of annoying when people say that I am. I just feel that there are a lot of normal people like me who have the same tendencies, but won’t admit it. Also, I just feel I grew into it, and many normal people grow into their kinks. If I’m not normal, what *is?*",29Apr2019,0

95,"Hello Reddit.

I've struggled with depression for **years.** I'm 24 now, and can remember having these symptoms since my teenage years: lethargy, not wanting to do anything, lying in bed every chance I got, isolation, self hatred, complete disinterest in everything. 

I still experience these symptoms on a daily basis, so have a long way to go. But for the first time I'm beginning to understand it and am making baby steps towards changing. It's not perfect, but if I compare this to how I was living five years ago, things are certainly better. I'm on medication and have been in counselling, but am also doing other things to help myself out.  I'm unemployed, having just finished university and having quit my terrible supermarket job, so signed up to volunteer at a local mental health charity. 

Until very recently, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram were occupying far too much of my mental space and my time. I saw people posting photos/videos of their adventures around the world, talking about their big life achievements or boasting about parties with friends. I got obsessed with other peoples' highlight reel. I felt even more isolated than depression already makes you feel. I also felt like my life was nothing in comparison to these people. Additionally, I wasted a lot of time on these sites. I'd find myself scrolling, watching video after video, reading post after post, sometimes for hours at a time. It was mind-numbing, as if depression isn't already mind-numbing enough. I was addicted to these websites - and for the life of me can't think why. What was I looking for? I didn't find it, whatever it was. I will never get those hours back, but am determined not to waste any more time using them. 

I installed an app on my computer that blocks Facebook and Twitter and deleted Instagram from my phone. I kept Facebook messenger on my phone so that I can stay in touch with friends - I feel this is important to me. I kept Snapchat, but only kept close friends as contacts - people who don't bombard me with photos all day every day - but perhaps send the occasional uplifting photo or message my way. In other words, I kept in touch with the people I really value and who, in turn, make it known they value me by staying in contact. 

It has only been a few days since I did this but already feel a bit more present. I don't find myself thinking about the ""amazing"" lives of other people so much, and don't feel the compulsion to post interesting things about my own life and recieve validation from other people for it. Ok, so depression did not miraculously melt away (I am writing this from bed and have yet to eat today, at 3pm), but I think it's important to recognise each step you take in the right direction. I'm determined to kick the social media habit and am making a conscious effort to stay away from it every day. Still use Reddit but don't allow myself to surf for hours, only to write important posts like this one and look for other inspirational posts/people I can help.",29Apr2019,19

I get episodes where I lose my shit and just want to punch stuff and can't calm down. But one thing keeps striking my mind, I have the sudden urge to kill people. I've never felt sadness to death unless it's a family member, otherwise I couldn't care. In my spare time I go on BestGore, draw graphic drawings and speak to myself a lot without myself knowing.

I sat there for an hour debating whether I should it shouldn't. I usually carry a knife around with me because I have severe hyper vigilance. I'm always looking for something that isn't there. I play the role people want me to play, I like attention and making people fall in love with me. People try call me a nice guy but I'm really not. I want to hurt people, I like it to an extent. 

I was debating whether I post this of not because I don't want to be insulted. I do suffer from depression, anxiety and multiple other things. I am trying to get treated, but whenever the chance comes around I don't want to helped. I like being fucked up, I want to be more fucked up. I deprive myself from food and sleep a lot.

I have no support from my family, and I'm really just struggling to find motivation to exist.

&amp;#x200B;

These past few days I've been terrified that I'm going to die in my sleep, and I've had a fluttering feeling in my chest along with difficulty breathing at times and numbness in my limbs and it scares the hell out of me.

I haven't felt that before except for during panic attacks, but now that feeling has been stuck for days and it really feels like my heart is going to just stop. Like If I fall asleep it'll stop and I won't notice because well, I'll be dead. 

 I wouldn't really mind dying, I don't think. It's something I've struggled with too. But it would break my boyfriend's heart, and his mental health is awful as it is. I don't want to think about what he'd do. The worst part is, we're long distance (9000 miles), and he's visiting me in 46 days. It'll be the first time we see each other, and it somehow fell in the middle of a mental breakdown on what almost seems to be both of our part sometimes. I don't want to break his heart by fucking dying, especially not before I get to hug him at least once. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to manage all this anxiety, I dont know how to manage this stress. It's been eating away at me for years at this point. I'm only 17, I feel too young to feel this way. It makes me feel so guilty, but at the same time I feel like I've lost the past 5 years to feeling awful in varying degrees. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to get away from everything. I feel trapped and hopeless and like I'm suffocating and I feel desperate most of all. Like ''wounded-animal-trapped-in-a-corner-about-to-lash-out'' desperate. I feel like I'm going to lash out in some way or form, be it quit school completely or just leave everything and hop on a train to see how long It takes my family to force me to come back. I desperately need to learn how to handle this.",29Apr2019,1
114," Don't know if this post belongs here. Repost from askatherapist

I was very lazy this semester and i know it. I just got my grade for my chem class at a 79. The teacher confirmed I will be getting a C. I missed a handful of classes this semester left early in another handful(5-7 classes) didn't get above a C on any test yet the teacher is so generous with test corrections I got a 78.5.This will be my first C in a college class. The thing is I know I deserve a D in this course if it was with any other stricter teacher and I cheated on the final off the guy sitting next to me. Yet instead of being grateful of the fact that I got a C even through CHEATING i am in tears that I didn't get a B. Like, this teacher was unbelievably generous in points and I didn't study for the final at all (high D on it brining my B down to a 79). I waited til the last minute for all homework didn't go to a single office hour for any of my classes this semester yet im stil a combination of mad and sad. 

Thinking about it I guess I feel entitled to a lot of things in life so how do i start to get over this feeling of entitlement?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I guess another way to describe it is I feel like a victim here for not getting the B. so maybe i have a victim mentality

124,"Hello reddit.  I am a 28 year old male who has struggled with depression two separate periods in my life, and I have general anxiety / always have.  I have been working on my mental health for 3 solid years now, and during that time, I have been able to get to know my demons and understand them, and I generally perceive myself as a whole new person, better than I ever thought I could be.  On a daily basis, I have an incredible life.  I am having difficulty accepting how good my life is.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a good job that allows me to take it easy when I need to, and pays me well enough to travel and experience things with friends near and far.  I am fulfilled with my work (for the time being) and the life that it allows me to have.  I have an amazing amount of friends - including seven who I consider my emotional guardians / people that I trust wholly with everything about me, and three of them I consider each my best friend.  These people all help me when I am down, ask me spontaneously how I am doing and check on me, and go out of their way to talk to me when I need it.  I feel like that's already more than most people get in a lifetime.  I have been losing weight (been overweight my whole life) and am in better physical and mental health than I have been in my entire life - actually, I got a physical last month, and the doctor said my bloodwork shows that I am technically perfectly healthy on paper (aside from physical ailments / mental health); this has never been the case in my life.  I have a photo album that I add pictures to whenever I travel or see friends, and within the last 5 years I've added over 700 photos, almost all of which are distinct separate memories, large or small.  My friend group expands across the entire country for various gaming communities I'm a part of, and because I'm a raver and enjoy sharing love and meeting people from all across the land.  I've been making myself spend time on hobbies and trying to be idle less and less often, and it really helps and works.  Both of my parents are remarried and happy, and are doing well, and so is my brother.

&amp;#x200B;

As a person, I am the selfless empath that has always gone out of my way to help other people.  I listen to people vent, I offer advice, I go help them if they need a set of hands, I will be someone's company if they just don't want to be alone.  The vast group of my friends all know this about me, and appreciate me because of it, and as more time passes I am told by more and more people that I bring light into their lives just by being there. Within the last 3 years of working on my mental health, I have grown to actually like who I am and appreciate who I am, for the first time in my life.  I've always had self esteem issues.  I'm aware that I am a selfless person and I enjoy helping others when I can.  I feel like my life's purpose is to help other people, and that's what I do, and I am happy with this purpose.   (none of this is meant to sound conceited - it's the truth, and sometimes when I hear the appreciation from others, it makes me cry)  

&amp;#x200B;

Given all of the above... as I scroll through my photo album, I feel like I have won.  My life contains no stress right now and no drama of any kind, just a tall stack of amazing memories and laughs and beautiful amazing humans.  What I have difficulty with is the fact that I feel like there is some disaster around the corner waiting for me.  I listen to the song ""The Nights"" by Avicii and I feel like the lyrics speak to me about leaving this world behind and living a life that I will always remember, and I feel like I've had more laughs and happy memories with people than most people get in an entire lifetime.  I've gone through a lot of trauma in my life, which is why I have emotional issues (I also have really bad trust issues / abandonment issues, so perhaps it's related to those), but for upwards of an entire year, my life has been... the literal best life that I could ever imagine having.  There is no material item on Earth that I want that could make me any happier, and all that I can keep doing is sharing my life with other people and making more memories.  I just have this feeling that I can't shake that the end is near or something awful has to be coming soon.  I think because I've struggled with stress or trauma or uphill battles my entire life, this plateau I'm standing on just feels like there is something looming above me that I just can't see, and I can't just be content.

&amp;#x200B;

**tldr** Mainly, I'm wondering if anyone has run into this before.  I feel like I have the best possible life I could ever ask for, and I feel like there has to be some kind of doom around the corner waiting for me; I believe because I've struggled with stress and anxiety my entire life, I simply do not know how to just... accept happiness.",29Apr2019,1

The problem with thoughts, feeling, these kind of things are that they are not like a broken finger or bleeding cut, noticing the anomaly and reason behind it, can be very hard.  I have tongue tie. Now since I couldn't easily see the difference between my tongue and other normal tongue like the way I could see the difference between my height-HairColour-PupilColor and others height-hair; I never realized that my slight speech problem is due to tongue tie, until I was 18 years old.  That made me think that just like I couldn't easily compare and see the difference; feelings and thoughts can't be easily compared with someone else's thoughts taking theirs as a standard one.  As another example verbal thinker's would have never thought that there might people who prefer thinking in terms of pictures rather than conversations.

143,"I made this account because I don't have anyone to talk to about this IRL, so forgive the randomly generated username. I'm currently seeing a therapist and am on generic lexapro (if that info makes a difference).  After a bout of self-harm last December, I was diagnosed with major depression, general anxiety disorder, and gender dysphoria. After I started therapy, my therapist basically said she was withholding a PTSD diagnosis because of some stuff I'd brought up about my childhood.

&amp;#x200B;

My therapist has been encouraging me to ""give back"" to the LGBT+ community, so I went to a couple of get togethers this last weekend with my wife (who is trans). At first I thought it was triggering because I'm not out to ANYONE gender-wise,  and I felt sad because now I'm around a lot of trans people but I could never transition myself. But as I was trying to get to sleep last night, I realized that the pain I was feeling was identical to the pain I felt when I was younger and supposedly dealing with PTSD. Which meant I can't actually have gender issues, because it would feel different, right? Obviously (that question was rhetorical).

&amp;#x200B;

My therapist is big on the ABCD of feelings model, where the ""action"" part is either Aggressive or Assertive. I think there is also a passive, but we haven't discussed that and it wasn't on the model she gave me. I at first thought I was passively not trying to rock the boat, but thanks to the ""this feels the same"" realization of last night, I had an epiphany this morning. I'm just making all this up because I'm addicted to feeling bad. Like yes, my dad did some stuff when I was a kid that wasn't great, but \*I\* chose how I reacted to the possibility of dying. I didn't have real PTSD like so many people do, I just shifted the blame onto his actions instead of assertively recognizing I was making a choice to react in a certain way. And because I apparently like being miserable on some level, I decided to mimic having genuine depression, anxiety, and gender dysphoria. It's all just a trick by my brain to give me that sweet, sweet unhappiness, I guess? God, brains are dumb.

&amp;#x200B;

 ANYWAY, you would think realizing I'm just dumb and not actually mentally ill would make me happy, but it hasn't? I'm telling myself over and over again that none of this is real, that I can go off my meds, and I don't need therapy anymore. That I can confidently tell my wife and my best friend, both of whom have \*real\*, actual problems that I am 100% here to support them and have no issues of my own now, so no worries. But instead I've been miserable all day, bursting out crying, etc. I thought about self harm because, hello, what kind of fucking idiot convinces themselves they have depression etc. for no reason??? But I promised my wife I wouldn't, so I just didn't have lunch instead. I've looked up online how to safely step down from my medication and get off it altogether, since I don't need it.

&amp;#x200B;

So my basic question (sorry for the overlong post) is: has anyone else gone through this, and if so, how long did it take for your brain to ""accept"" that nothing is wrong? I made sure I repeated it multiple times before I took a nap this afternoon, so it would sink into my subconscious, and also made sure to dress in clothes that make me feel dysphoric to reinforce this is just me being stupid and addicted to being sad. And yes, I know less than 24 hours is too soon--I might be stupid enough to think I'm depressed, etc but I'm not QUITE that dumb. :) But I'd appreciate comments from anyone else who has been through something similar?

144,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to get this off my chest, and I wasn't sure where else was suitable to post it.

&amp;#x200B;

 I met my best friend in year 12 and we hit it off pretty much instantly. We have a ridiculous amount in common (we sometimes joke that we're two clones of the same idiot), and I feel like I can share pretty much anything with her. We were close and things were pretty okay, but in October things really took a downturn for both of us. Unfortunately our similarities include our mental health, but we hadn't really talked to each other about it and so neither of us really realised how much the other was struggling. We started to isolate ourselves, but her isolation also included pushing me away while I became kind of clingy to her. We both felt selfish that the other was our friend, but while she wished I'd forget about her I was scared she'd forget about me. We were both in a very dark place, but we still kept in contact to an extent. I would've texted more often, but I was scared that I'd be harassing her. It was the occasional reply from her that kept me going.

Things continued that way for a little while, but earlier this year I ended up being hospitalised. I was scared of the ward, scared of the impact on my studies, but far and away I was most scared of losing her. I still feel selfish for sending it (and I'm not sure that'll ever change), but in February I sent her a text explaining what had happened, and basically asking her what I should do. The last thing I meant to do was scare her, but I don't think I'll ever be able to put into words how grateful I am to her for replying. I genuinely don't think I'd still be here today if she hadn't.

We started talking more often after that, gradually accepting that I wasn't going to forget about her, nor her forget me. Neither of us really realised how much we relied on each other, but we've become even closer than before. I've told her things I can't tell anyone else, and I'd trust her with my life. As much as we wish we could solve each other's problems, we both know we can't but we'll always be there for each other. I really don't deserve to know somebody as incredible as her. She's my rock, and as petty as it sounds she's my motivation to keep going. 

After a nightmarish five months for both of us, we were finally able to meet up again. I knew I'd missed her like hell, but I don't think I'd realised just how much I had missed her. I'm just so so thankful to have seen her again, because to be honest we'd both convinced ourselves we never would. It was a good day, and for the first time I actually believe that things can and will get better.

150,"This is probably the most open I've been about my mental health. I know most the people on here are not doctors, I'm not looking for a formal diagnosis. I'm just looking for suggestions regarding what conditions my symptoms sound like.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a male in my early twenties. I have ADHD and was/still am (not sure) diagnosed with seperation anxiety. I'm on Methylphenidate (Concerta) 100ish milligrams a day and have been on Concerta for at least 10 years with no problems. Oh and am on the high functioning end of the sprectum (ASD).

&amp;#x200B;

I weigh about 84KG and am 117.8CM (5 ft 10) giving me a higher than healthy BMI, 27 to 28 I'd guess. 

I have a history of self harm and suicidal thoughts mainly as a teenager with the self harm becoming less and less frequent but still present. I also have an undiagnosed restrictive episode at 15 which caused me to nearly be hospitalized due to low weight, if that is relevant. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sleep: I almost always over sleep, but don't always get to sleep when I want to.

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest problem is that my moods fluctuate. 

Right now I feel empty, nothing has happened to make me feel empty but I do. Small socially awkward interactions make me feel incredibly awkward when I'm in this state, things like misunderstandings and having to explain myself. I find myself sitting in my car outside a shop for hours, waiting for it to be quiet so I can go in, for fear if it was too busy everybody would be looking at me judging. I become incredibly anxious and take risks or fail to follow through with things. I've been looking at the same pile of clothes for a week and not eating for days and then getting really hungry and over eating and then feeling terrible for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I have good modes too, maybe too happy? I don't want to hint that I'm bi-polar-ish but my good moods can be a bit dangerous \*sometimes\* for example, driving a bit too fast, impulsive excessive shopping with the excuse \*You deserve it\*. I become more extroverted in my good moods, I want to catch up with people, see how they're doing and I am just an all round happier person. But it's sort of hard for me to explain because at the moment I'm not in a ""happy"" mood.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, and I've told doctors before during mental health assesments and they've always shrugged their shoulders but in the past I'm pretty sure I've heard things and smelt things which wernt there, but these all happened within like a few hours/the same day. I heard people calling my name but nobody was there and I was somewhere indoors and all I could smell was petrol and freshly cut grass, nobody else could smell it. I don't know if that was some sort of episode? It hadn't thought about it until typing but it was the day before I was in hospital having a mental health assessment for wanting to kill myself so maybe theres a link?

&amp;#x200B;

And, if this has any diagnostic weight, my self confidence is 0, like I loathe mirrors, don't like my body, who I am as a person or anything like that.

i understand that you are supposed to act like this, and say this, and not be so rude, or selfish, and i understand when i am rude and selfish (usually after, or subconsciously-conscious before) and i have terrible memory when it comes to incorrect actions, and i don't know how to study, or anything, and i have never been bullied. it is almost like this universal thing. everyone has been bullied by some bad kid. everyone has had massive amounts of grounding, and ass wooping, and i have received similar treatment, but only in small amounts when i am at my dads once a year. and even then, the first 12 years of my life i just god mad right back at them. took me until i was 13 till i realized that maybe they are correct, and since then i have realize a lot of shitty things i have done, and still sometimes do, and i want to say sorry. but i know that saying sorry means nothing to my brother because of how badly i used to treat him and how mindlessly i used that word in the first 12 years, and that my step mom and dad will just take it and go on, and it won't feel right, and i know my mom, who never disciplines me, will just be like ""oh don't worry, you are fine! you are a good kid! you have done nothing wrong! they just want to make you feel bad!"" which i know is not the case. and now i am in this middle ground of the selfish habit to just do whatever i want, whenever, because i want to, no matter how others may feel, and my guilty conscious, making me feel like shit, and making me feel repressed, and not try get what i want which might be ""insert item"" or ""insert friendship"" or ""insert relationship"", or makes me feel constantly like i might be acting selfish, or rude, or mean to someone when i might or might not be. i hate this. i want to reset, with a family that doesn't half treat me like a prince, and half treat me like a human, with a fucking history of terrible selfish narcissistic family that gave me whatever i wanted. 

you know like, in those narcissistic family there is the one who is constantly picked on and abused, and one who is treated well, and like a prince, and given whatever they want? i am the prince, only occasionally being taught how to act like a good human.

155,"I hate posting this

This sucks.  I've been watching myself deteriorate for years under the pressures of anxiety.  I really don't want to fucking do it, but I have to admit now that I have a problem and I have to do something about it.

My parents see my issue as a hindrance to them and have a 'suck it up' mentality.  They'll never help me or understand my problems because they don't think I have any.  Clearly, getting help is something I have to deal with, and something I have to keep hidden from them or else I'll be ""overreacting""

They don't know shit.  They don't know what I feel or how I act in public.  I'd have to kill a man to get them to understand I have problems.

Rose colored glasses
I look at the world through rose colored glasses.
I only pay attention to the positive emotions and pretend that every other feeling doesn't exist.
I pretend that the sad parts of life don't happen. 
I live in the constant mindset of ""I'm perfectly fine!""
I act like my life is this pretty shade of pink. 
I play the role of the ""happy- go- lucky teenage girl who always has a smile""
I paint my face with the same happy expression every morning.
I sculpt the laughter lines into my skin, only to come home at the end of the day and tear myself apart.
I'm tired of pretending.
I'm tired of looking through rose colored glasses.
I want to smash the pink lenses into fairy dust to sprinkle around my room as I dance.
I want to use the wire frames to hang the pictures of my life.
I want to put on my prescription glasses and take in the magnificent array of colors surrounding me.
I want to rip myself open and use my emotions as my  palette.
I want to paint a mural on my bedroom wall.
I want to use these newfound colors to paint a picture I want to see. 
I want to take the greens of envy and jealousy and use them to paint the leaves on the tree of life and the grass in the field of my dreams.
I want to use the reds of love and friendship to color the fruit on the tree.
I would paint the trunk brown I get from the effort I put forth every day. 
I'd use the deep blues and blacks of depression and fear to paint the night sky.

162,"Something happened to me yesterday that was unlike anything that's ever happened to me before and I'm trying to get some clarity on the situation.  When it was happening I thought I was having some kind of psychotic break. 

Basically I was talking with a good friend and she was asking me how my mental health disorders affect my life.  I was explaining to her that although my life looks great on the outside (I'm in college, I have a 4.0, I have a job, I get really high performance scores at work, and I volunteer every week for homeless services) I really hate myself and I feel like I'm a terrible person that will never be self sufficient.  And she asked me ""why?"" and all of a sudden I had this intense realization that I couldn't really answer her question.  Like internally I feel like shit but I don't know why I feel any less capable than anyone else and I don't know why I feel like a bad person when I do my best to be a good person.

And then my brain just broke.  I couldn't remember who I was.  I couldn't remember who she was.  I couldn't remember anything in my entire life at all.  My friend later told me that my eyes were going from side to side very quickly.  I kept telling her that everything was fine because I knew I was having an episode of some kind but after several minutes I started to think I wouldn't snap out of it and I told her something was wrong and she needed to call my mom, even though I couldn't remember who my mom was.  It then morphed into a weird panic attack where I realized that I have been living in a middle state where I'm not taking control of my life and taking care of my mental health the way I know I should but I'm also too scared to kill myself so I've been living in this excruciatingly painful middle state where I just hate my existence but don't do anything to change it.  I felt like I was having a battle in my head where I had to choose if I wanted to live or die in that moment and it took all of my strength to fight off ""the dark side"".  It was the most emotionally painful experience I've ever had and I have no idea what it was.  That was followed by a severe panic attack which was more like what I'm used to.  After my mom picked me up I slept for 18 hours and woke up feeling normal again.

Background: I am a 23 y/o female diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety, depression, and borderline. I frequently experience panic attacks (heart racing, trouble breathing, thinking I'm going to die), what I would call flashbacks (unpleasant memories combined with sounds, smells or touches that I think I'm experiencing, but I don't fully lose touch with reality), and mild dissociation (feeling like things aren't real, lights feel too bright, things appear hazy, feeling like I'm not quite in my body, not hearing people when they speak to me). This didn't feel like any of those things, or maybe I just have never experienced them fully before.  Any ideas what the fuck just happened to me?

Literally like 15 minutes ago I was in an argument with my parents and right in the middle of yelling my entire chest cramped and I couldn’t take a breath either in or out. Next thing I know I’m in my room and I just start crying. My breathing is still irregular, but it’s more controlled. 

I have a tremor too. My muscles are very weak and I have trouble with balance and I’m seeing a doctor for it, though my parents haven’t taken me back for any further testing and probably won’t for a while. 

Idk for some reason I feel like I’m dying. I have chest pains really often and I feel like I’m 80 years old. I have these intense mood swings and lately have been feeling like my brain isn’t working right. Like I cry at random times and overall feel like something isn’t right.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom has always had a history of  mental illness, she divorced my father when me and my sister were very young. She had been in trouble with the law about 15 years ago when caught stealing credit cards, and was diagnosed with kleptomania. She had been going to therapy pretty often after the incident and had seemed perfectly fine. But over the past year her mental health had started to decline again. She lives with my grandma and works a dead end job. She has been going on and on the past year about posting information to social media and being careful because you never know who's looking. Now, this past week she had gone to a religious retreat, and during the retreat they were discussing having conversations with God. This brought her into a severe panic attack and had to leave early.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past week she has broken her phone, broken her laptop, been parking in unusual spots and walking to her house to hide her car. She went over to my aunt's house today and called me and my sister up, telling us that someone's watching her and everyone's talking about her. Her side of the family is really old-fashioned in that they sweep everything under the rug. So they are not about to call a hospital or whoever necessary to get her help.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do? It feels like if I call for help it would just worsen the situation, dissolving her trust in me and causing the paranoia to increase. She talked about moving in with me and that is just not possible at the time for me.  I am very worried about her

I thought he would make me happy and whole again, but im not, ill never be whole, ill never know what happy feels like again. theres no fixing me. all I know is anger and sadness, I cannot feel happy, its all just empty, anything that would make me happy turns to ash and dies before I feel anything. it died when I was a kid, I used to know happy, I remember I did, my childhood is kind of a blur though but with some vivid moments, my parents were and are never there for me, they love my sister more, they never once asked me how I was feeling, never once wanted to know what I was interested in, hell they dont even know my favourite colour thats how little they give a fuck about me as a person. all they'd do is argue with each other, my parents I mean, my mother says such horrible things to my dad that you can never take back, and then they both take it out on me after, I learnt very quickly that my feelings and problems didnt and still dont matter, I have to lie and say everythings fine or im dead, so i learned to mask my feelings and pretend they werent happening, they'd buy my sister things and id have to earn them myself (and they did not give me pocket money so this was particularly difficult). most days I remember not wanting to come home from school, dreading every second. having to dance around my mothers feelings and problems, her mood dictates everything in life, whether that day im going to get shouted at and called things and told how shit i am and how the problem is all my fault and my fathers all day. or she'll be happy for once and maybe, maybe do something nice, having to pander to a much older ladies feelings ever since you were little whilst shutting out your own does a LOT of damage let me tell you. and now as an adult, early 20's, im stuck with sudden outbursts of extreme rage, huge suicidally depressed episodes every other night.

I dont know how to cope, knowing that I will never feel the light again, ill never remember what it felt like to be happy anymore, and that I have such a long life ahead of me to live through being a walking corpse, dead inside and dead to the world around me.

I have had therapy for 2 years and NOTHING has changed, the only good change I have to look forward to is finishing uni next year and finally moving out into a world I can barely manage because my brains so fucked I forget everything and anything.
