0,"Does anyone know of any good treatments for Severe Treatment Resistant  long lasting Depression? I've been severely depressed for 3 going on 4  years, with many suicide attempts. I've tried years and years of  therapy, EMDR, and many, many meds and supplements. (I'm guessing at  least 30-40) Does anyone know any treatments other than these? I'm  considering Ketamine, but I've heard that only works short term and not  long term. I'm only 15 so I can't do ETC, and I don't think I can do TMS  either. Any ideas of what I can do?

8,"Hi, I've recently started on medication and have only been taking it for two days, but already noticed a ""dulling of the senses"".

I'm just on Lexapro, and it has made me calmer, which is great!

I just don't feel like . . . myself.

It's strange.

My mind doesn't feel as though it's constantly under attack anymore, yet that also means that I experience less excitement, vivacity, and thought.

&amp;#x200B;

The only previous pill that I've been on is Cymbalta, and I dropped it due to it also not making me feel like myself.

I'm concerned I will do the same again.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if the effects are worth it, but really don't want to quit this pill so quickly. 

It has made me feel focused and still. 

&amp;#x200B;

What helps you stay on your prescriptions? 

I know 2 days is nothing, but I really forsee the potential of me quitting before I've been on them long enough to get a good enough look of how they effect me.

How do I convince myself to stay on them no matter how they change me and my thinking?

Thnx for any reply.",13Apr2019,1
9,"I’ve been depressed since I was around 9.  I made an attempt at 12 and was put into recovery.  Now, as a 16 year old, I’m suffering again.  I was never ‘cured’ of my depression, I personally believe such a cure doesn’t exist.  From 12 to 14 were the best years of my life.  Then all my childhood friends told me they secretly hated me.  Worse, these kids were the only ones I shared common interests with in school.  I had stuck by them for years, never bothering with other friends.  Now I was left all alone.  I became self-conscious because of them; I can’t accept that anyone would love/like/tolerate me.  I’ve tried branching out, but I don’t know how to make friends.  I reach out plenty, but often people find me annoying or just depressing.  I’m annoying and depressing because I’m depressed; I’m depressed because I can’t make friends and I can’t make friends cause I’m annoying.  That little cycle is basically how me trying to become friendly with people works.  I have acquaintances, but none of them give a shit about me.  Now, I keep having arguments in my own head.  Different parts of my personality make different calls on decisions I have to make.  Even when nothing is happening, they are all bickering in my head.

I don’t know what do do anymore. I’m so lonely and just so in pain and drained. I am an only child with a single mother who on days I don’t have physical therapy gets home past seven. My father is scum of the earth to me and he was an alcoholic and emotionally abused my mom and I watched all of their fights and sometimes my mom would talk me to my aunt and uncles how’s to get away from him. She finally got a divorce and got away from him and we stayed with my grandparents until we got our own house. I am alone in the house after school most days with my four cats who just do what they want and don’t bother me.

I have also been waking up about two to three to four times each night and wake up feeling extremely exhausted and like I hadn’t slept the night. My two best friends have each gone two different schools and I rarely see them. I feel like they were the only things I had to look forward to. I also changed schools and have friends there but they don’t really seem to care about me except for one. At lunch I put Saran Wrap against my face like I wanted to suffocate my self and they just laughed like it was a joke, and it was at first but then I thought would they really care if I had actually suffocated, would they just think it was a joke I don’t know. I’m just so tired I don’t know what to do anymore and I feel like when someone says anything it is just in slow motion. I’m so tried of being lonely and drained and in pain. I love my mom and she is everything I could ask for and more but she is just so busy and thinks everything is fine with me. Surprisingly you can hide so much from someone one floor below you and who is watching tv.

18,"Something I find difficult is being social and meeting new people. I tend to stay in small circles, even if I am not fully happy within that friend's group.  Doing this has made me very unhappy.  How you execute yourself and how you find that light within yourself has a lot to do with the people you choose to have in your life. Always remember that it is your life and you get to be selfish about who you choose to be friends with or have other relationships with.  Meeting the right people or person is hard, but one should keep trying. I found that a huge factor on why I feel down and unmotivated about life is due to the type of people I choose to surround myself with. You want to be around people who are there for you and love you, and those people are hard to find, but if you find yourself in an unhappy situation with your relationships you need to end those relationships for your own wellbeing. You derve to be happy, so surround yourself with those who make you happy",13Apr2019,2

I know it was just one session and he didn't suggest anything, but I feel stuck. I've been thinking about my situation a lot recently, and I think I've cleared my bias to find something that been weighing on me my entire life. I need other people for happiness. And so, I have never been happy. For most of my life, people have let me down, screamed at me, hurt me, abused me either emotionally or physically (by bullies), or done something else to make me feel not worth it. It makes me feel subhuman, disconnected from other people because I see myself as not worth a damn thing. I know ""Lack of confidence"" isn't a mental illness but the side effects are. I've developed severe anxiety about my s/o and her actions, I've been in a depressed state so my grades have dropped significantly so that adds a NEW anxiety to the situation that I have to deal with. I feel lost, I feel unloved, and I cannot stand on my own because I never learned how to love myself because from a very young age I was a disappointment to people. I don't see myself as a human being, I see myself as something subhuman. I feel different, I barely feel love, and my anxiety has made me paranoid about my significant other and it has led to many fights, arguments, etc. I feel worthless. I need this to end now. If I could just feel better about myself, if I could just feel the love and see things from a new perspective then I could be happy again. I could be more careless, more mentally and emotionally stable. I blame myself for most of the things that have happened to me. I don't know what to do. I feel lost.

22,"**Some context: I'm in the process of trying to make sure my little brother isn't allowed to get a GED. I don't like the idea of him having even more free time than now because of his behavior. I think he would become a big(ger) danger to himself and others if that happened. I am trying to possible diagnoses from various people online because in real life my dad doesn't seem to care about what happens so long as he doesn't have to be a responsible adult. I'm trying to show him what he's doing to his son. Here is what I wrote on another post somewhere else:**

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm 18 and he's 15 for reference.

When he was little, he didn't start talking until he was 4 years old, and even then it was only a few words when he wanted something. He had a dead stare in his eyes all the time. At age 6, he finally used complete sentences, and facial expressions started showing (but he still had a resting b\*\*\*\* face, always has). He also used to throw tantrums when he didn't get what he wanted, but that was just because our dad always gave in to them I think.

I actually kind of resent our dad because he was always giving him attention and not me because he was the naughty one and I was the good one. My little brother was always talking back at school and never wanted to do his work. He got written up a lot for not listening and for yelling at teachers. He didn't seem to care. (One time he actually listened for a while, and he made decent grades. But that didn't last for long.) Even now he gets in trouble a lot at school.

As he got older, he started becoming more violent. At this point our dad stopped caring and just let him do whatever. One time, when he was 9, he told me he killed a bird when he was at the park with his friend. He seemed really proud of himself. I told on him, but our dad did nothing except tell him it was wrong. He never told me anything like that again, but I doubt he hasn't done it again.

He also sometimes has mental breakdowns. One time we were home alone and he started yelling at nothing and broke a vase. I tried to get him to calm down he that only made things worse. When I asked about it later he told me, and I quote, ""F\*\*\* off."" This happens every now and then, and every time he becomes hostile if I comment or try to help. I've also heard him mumbling to himself sometimes or looking like he's in a daze. I feel like this might be schizophrenia, but that's why I'm asking here so I know.

Also, back to his early childhood, our dad used to let him eat a lot, so he was really obese. And even though he's thin now, he still eats a lot. I'm talking eating until the point of extreme discomfort. One time he ate so much he was crying. I heard him in his bedroom from downstairs (he wouldn't let me call the doctor though). I don't understand how he maintains his weight, I hope he's not throwing up or anything. I've tried to get him to not eat so much, but whenever I try he shoves me away or yells or curses at me. I've tried hiding some of the food, but later I'll see the wrappers in the trash. I've stopped trying at this point.

I want to know what might be wrong with him. Maybe if I can show our dad just how serious this is he'll actually see what's happening to his son and get him help. This has been going on for too long and I'm really worried about him.""",13Apr2019,1

Hello.

I am a suboxone patient who has been on the same dosage for close to ten years now. A more recent requirement is that I attend some sort of counseling or therapy from a licensed doctor. For a while I was doing a local group session headed by a licensed substance abuse counselor until he left.

My doctor changed and now they want proof again that I am attending some sort of counseling. The problem is, I'm very low income / insurance doesnt cover addiction treatment (insane deductible) and struggling to purchase my medicine / doctor visits as it is. I can not afford another 50-100$ to attend a counseling session or see a psychiatrist.

I was suggested that there may be online group sessions or free/low cost therapy online. I am not looking to be prescribed anything I just need to show my current doctor that I am attending some sort of help. Does anyone know some good resources? Even if it was a weekly chat headed by a doctor I would be happy with that.

Thank you all!",13Apr2019,4

We have a dog, he's scared of everything but a dog. During the week I have vivid dreams of people breaking in and I wake up and I have to check the locks and windows. I wake up either every hour or two with these dreams. Sometimes I have sleep paralysis.

As some background I'm 27, and this is the first apartment where I've been the ""man of the house"".
I would rather not have a gun, a non lethal weapon would be preferred.
My end goal is to not be so concerned at night and not wake up to every creak of the apartment and have the need to check the doors.

I hate feeling so terrible all the time about myself and not being able to do anything about it. 
I’m terrified at the prospect of coming out to my family. I can’t sleep at night. I worry that they won’t accept me. I worry that I won’t be able to go on hormones. I worry so much. 
It’s affecting everything. I’m constantly paranoid that my friends hate me and think I’m annoying. School is terribly difficult for me, and watching my grades fall has been so scary. 
I was on a two month and ten-day streak of not self-harming, which I broke a few days ago. I felt so overwhelmed by everything life was throwing at me, I was desperate. 
Life has been so incredibly rough, and I’m starting to think suicide might be better. I really don’t know who else to turn to. I don’t know if this is the right sub for this, but I could really, really use some positivity right now. 

tl;dr young closeted trans guy, life is beating the hell out of me, feeling suicidal and scared. don’t know where else to go.",13Apr2019,6
38,"This has been really, really bothering me:


Up until recently, I always thought that I genuinely care about people, and that people genuinely care about me.


That is, until I found out that a lot of the people who I thought were my friends really just need me in my life for certain reasons and nothing more. Let me explain further:


I've been really sick with an unknown health condition the last four months (nothing contagious, but big internal issues) - I'm almost 80% better now thankfully, but during that time, I didn't think about much except just trying to survive. 


Now that I'm a lot better, I've realized not nearly as many people came around when I was sick that I thought would, most likely because I was much more reserved and not my usual bubbly self. I kinda forgave them for that though. Not everybody is going to value you enough to come visit you in the hospital, or still be around you when you're not at your 100%, because everyone has their own struggle, and I've accepted that fact.  


And I'm so very grateful for the people who did spend some time with me during that very scary time, especially my family, because I really needed my people. I was so scared.


But I realized something else:


My close friends tend to talk a lot about themselves; the stuff that they're excited about or the stuff that's bothering them, and they want my opinion or just want me as a source to vent to. And I normally *love* that so much. I love truly getting to know my friends and being a shoulder for them to lean on and making them feel better, and then in turn, making them feel good also makes me feel good, so then everyone is feeling good and it's wonderful - or at least, that's how I thought that's how it works.


When it was my turn to talk about my problems - when I was the down and out one, I realized that these friends hardly spent any of their time listening to me, (excluding my bestest friend) they listened somewhat, but I needed to talk more. I needed more comfort, and I needed them to just listen, but it just felt like the more I needed them, the more out or reach they were. And now I find them canceling plans with me left and right, which was never a thing that happened before, and I'm afraid I know why, but I'm not 100% certain.


I'm so so hurt by all this. And all of this has brought me to this:


Do human beings actually have the capacity to actually care about each other? Or do we only care about a person if they make us somehow feel good about ourselves?


**The very worst part of all this, is that now I'm even struggling with understanding my own morals.** My friends really hurt me though all this, and now I'm starting to question whether or not I truly care about them, because now when they snapchat me or text me, I just feel sick to my stomach, and I hesitate to answer them, because I really don't want to. 


Does this mean I'm slowly starting to stop caring about them? Does this mean that I'm guilty of the very same thing that I accused them of? Does this mean I only care about people when they have something good to give me? Is that how everyone is?? Does nobody actually care about one another unless there's something to gain from them???  Is everything I thought about myself and wanting to help people, just another way I feed my ego and make myself happier? 


This new thought pattern has completely torn me apart. I feel like I've been lying to myself my whole life. I thought that people can truly care about each other; about each others feelings, each other's goals, each other's dreams, each other's fears.  


Now? I have no idea.


I have no idea if caring about another person is even possible.


Has anyone dealt with these feelings? Does anyone have any personal thoughts about any of this? I really need to hear this from people who don't know me personally. Because of course, if I bring this up to any of my friends, their natural response will probably either ""of course we care!"" or they'll just change the subject. 


Also, I'm 25F, if that information helps at all, and my closest friends are a mixture of 3 men and 3 women. 


Tldr: Do human beings actually have the capacity to actually care about each other? Or do we only care about a person if they make us somehow feel good about ourselves?",13Apr2019,9
39,"So...idk, i probably don't have anything wrong with me but there's a chance right? So for a while(maybe a year or so) I've started spacing out/pretty much just staring at a wall or something from what I know, a lot of times I hear like, not outside voices, but like thoughts(but not like my thoughts I don't think) that comment on stuff or give me advice or whatever, like i.e. Say I got a cut on my hand: Unknown voice: ""you should clean that!"" Stuff like that, or maybe I see a hot/sharp/dangerous object: Other Unknown Voice: ""you should touch that.*insert me with a concerned look on my face*""(btw I don't self harm other than unconsciously scratching myself sometimes, I don't being in pain) Sometimes I forget minor things(like if I brushed my teeth in the morning, if I fed the dog, etc.), but nothing really serious as far as I know. I can't really remember most of my childhood past age...8, up until we moved about half a year ago? I mean, I remember basically this year and stuff, but almost 4/5 years missing is kind of weird, right? So if this matters, I don't remember anything really bad happening in my childhood(which is why I probably don't have anything wrong) Ok so maybe we were poor and had to move a lot, but thats ok? And my parents used to fight a lot(they don't anymore) in front of 5-6 year old me. Oh, and my mom told me a lot about her life, like the part where she was raised in a concerningly cult like religious family and that's why she can't remember any of her childhood, and how her elderly dying dad was neglected in a hospital, along with other things...but that's what happened to her, not me, so basically nothing happened to me and I just have bad memory and stuff right? Idk, i guess this was just me talking about me being paranoid and stuff... But is it normal for a 14/15 year old to have memory problems and stuff like that? I need an opinion plz.",13Apr2019,1
40,"For the past few years I have been censoring my opinions and my needs from others. As a result I am often left internally conflicted and telling myself it doesn't matter just leaves me depressed and hopeless. It also divorces me from reality somewhat, as I find myself daydreaming to cope and not putting any stock in my emotions, acting very much on autopilot

I might play games despite knowing I have work to do, I might eat despite not being hungry or go upstairs/leave the room, ultimately knowing it's for no other purpose than to just waste time.

Beyond that I may eat badly despite knowing better, stay indoors for days at a time, shelter myself from positive experiences or just convince myself that there is nothing else to all this and that self harm be it long term or short term is the only viable coping strategy

Ignoring that my university degree has been profoundly damaging to my mental health in a way I was unable to cope with was my biggest mistake. Going to university to begin with, at least without the level of self awareness that I needed to seek help for issues that have since festered was another huge mistake, however at least on that front I know it is not entirely on me (The UKs education system is very aggressive at pigeon holing students into university and often dont entertain alternatives or consider a students mental well-being)

My point is...


I have accepted that the pain of my degree is normal
The pain of carrying group projects silently is normal
Being labeled plagiarist for one misstep is normal
Not speaking up or being my own person is normal

And so eating bad is normal
Not going outside is normal
Being flakey is normal
Avoiding activities is normal

Not loving myself is normal
Beleiving I am unskilled is normal
Feeling worthless is normal
Feeling unlovable is normal
Seeing no future for myself is normal

And so constantly sabotaging myself, my efforts to build a better future becomes the ultimate overbearing norm



I don't accept this ""Normal"" anymore. Today is the last time I am unconscious of self depreciation in the face of this current adversity. I'll make it through.

none of the various medications are working. I heard a song that I can basically relate to word by word.  vinnie paz-is happiness just a word.  

in some ways it relates to adhd,but after looking at the guy more I found out he has a disorder which he explains in the song.  depersonalisation dissociative disorder. so with that in mind I'm not sure,and a trigger for this can be drugs. I was addicted to spice for a few years,smoking daily. (it's basically plant matter sprayed with god knows what chemicals) even my Dr didn't know what to make of it when I showed him the ingredients.

this is how I feel.

My family don't understand what I go through
Under diagnosed for 20 years, ain't never broke through
You ever been in such a fog you don't know you?
Never being able to do the shit you're supposed to?
I wouldn't wish it on anyone that I'm close to
Wouldn't wish it on anybody that I'm opposed to
There's not an accurate diagnosis to show you
Basic neurobiology isn't close to it
I'm watching life as a spectator
I can't help myself, even though I possessed data
It's not a part of my spirit to want to test nature
You think you know what I'm feeling, cousin, then let's wager
I'm having trouble retaining new information
Familiar scenes starting to look foreign- derealization
Everybody tired of being patient
Mama wondering why her baby crying in the basement
Constant rumination just exacerbates it
To the point where I can't even barely narrate it
I've had doctors tell me that my mind is fascinating
But they can't tell me why the sickness has been activated

My head don't work, the meds don't work
But I don't want to be dead, dead don't work
Sleep's the cousin of death, the bed don't work
Maybe I'd rather be dead; dead don't hurt
Realization of an inherent emptiness
Maybe that's another sin for the pessimist
Possibly I am a jinn with a exorcist
I've fallen because I've been on the precipice
Maybe it's my mama's possible regret
Maybe it's a neurological neglect
Maybe it's the reason why water's wet
The angular gyrus and where the frontal lobe connect
But maybe I'm being too complicated for you
Maybe I should just be calm and explain it to you
The psychiatrist thinking they could fool you
Paxil, Zoloft, it's just wasteful to you
I've tried meditation, tried to sit in silence
But how the fuck that help a neurochemical imbalance?
Why would you tell a person that they were childish
Without an understanding of the pain that they surround in?
I always feel foggy somatic detatchment
It's like my body isn't connected to actions
It destroys everything that's affected the fragments
I don't have nothing but senses and sadness

I’ve been on medication for depression and anxiety for about a month and a half. It is not severe, but I get minor anxiety attacks(increase in heart rate and such) and strong urge to self-harm time to time. It’s been going on for almost my whole life. 

What I’m wondering is, how long do I have to take pills before I get better? Is it something I have to live with for the rest of my life? I’ve already asked my doctor, but he only said that I’ve been medicated for too short to see some progress and I should be patient. I understand that, but I still want to know about other people’s cases.
Also, in where I live, mental health medicines are directly given by the doctor without any prescription note or pharmacist’s explanation. That’s another reason I’m curious about my/other people’s medication. I don’t even know the exact name or side effects of my medicines, and my doctor doesn’t seem to give enough information to me.

58,"23f here. Been dealing with depression since my teens but last fall was an all time low for me, resulting in dropping out of school and quitting my job. I'm back in school, found another job, but I still feel depressed a lot. Yesterday was the first day I had to myself in a while so (even though I have a ton of homework to do) I spent the day basically napping and watching YouTube videos. I took three naps, even though I slept seven hours the night before. And I had no trouble falling asleep again that night. This morning I woke up and lamented that I would have to go to work instead of just sleep all day again and my bf starts going on about how I need to start exercising. He literally said Everytime he feels depressed it's because there's something else off in his life, so he just identifies the problem, and then finds a way to fix it, then bam! Depression fixed!! I keep trying to explain to him that it isn't as simple as that for everyone, but it seems like he doesn't want to admit that my depression might actually be something long term and separate from other Aspects of my life. I started seeing a new therapist a few weeks ago and will be going back this Thursday but it's getting hard for me to keep going with school and work. Especially since I my bf tries to be supportive by telling me how to fix stuff, which of course is not how to help someone with depression. I started taking dance class recently and it feels pretty unfair that he still wants to act like I'm doing something wrong by not working out. I'm pretty out of shape so I'm trying to start small and manageable. I started taking a multi vitamin too to help my vit D levels. I'm honestly at a loss with what I am supposed to be doing more. He tells me I should work out every morning but I don't want to push myself into a routine that's unsustainable at my current health. But after my last dance class he told me I pushed myself too far because I was sore and walking funny the next day, so I literally feel like I can't win. It's the last month of the semester so I have a million things to do for school and I know that that really gets me down. I don't like being in school and I never have, but I want a career someday so I need to do this. I'm just starting to feel hopeless and I worry that I will never really be happy.",13Apr2019,7

He has always been like this but now it is geting much worse. He is 37 years old. He is very intelligent and ironically is a licensed therapist.

 He will not listen to any of us because he thinks he is like the most enlightened person on the planet and all of us are of inferior intelligence.

63,"This is my grandmother. I know that grandmoms are generally considered adorable so before you start judging me as being the bad person you might have seen somewhere, plz take a moment and hear me out.

These are the things that she does:

1) she constantly talks about her other children and how great they are except my mother.

2) she constantly has a need. Either she needs someone to listen to her day to day ""struggles"" (things that other people don't bother about like waking up early, or waking up late).

3) she's constantly praising herself while at other times she's scolding my mom. Basically she makes my mom feel like she's a bad daughter, or unappreciated, or not okay as a person.

4) when my mom does some major task for her (something that took months or even a year of effort) then she (grandmom) doesn't acknowledge my mom's work. Even if my mom demands directly that she acknowledge her work, she either doesn't or finds a trivial fault with it.

5) she seems to like all other siblings except mom. I just cannot figure out why because I've been with the other siblings and they do absolutely nothing for her. Whenever there is family work to be done (like accounts or whatever) they point at my mom and she demands that my mom stop everything and do her work first (which my mom does readily).

6) when my mom talks about her troubles to grandmom, the latter remains very cold. It's as if she's listening with her ears closed. There's absolutely no amount of emotion that penetrates into her for my mom. I really mean this. She's got a complete zero love for mom.

7) when she hears some health advice from someone else, she comes back home and falsely blames my mom with lies. 

For example, someone told her that she should eat an apple and banana everyday for optimum health. So she came back and complained to my mom in a tone which said that she wasn't doing this because Mom didn't allow her. 

At this point my mom told her that fruits are always lying there in the house. No one has ever stopped her from eating them. If she wants to eat then all that she has to do is cut them or tell her and she'll cut them. And in fact, she's seen grandmom eating both apples and bananas since her childhood. But grandmom doesn't agree alleging that my mom didn't give her fruits. 

Although she doesn't speak out her criticism, my mom feels her criticism. When my mom gives the justification about nobody stopping her she doesn't acknowledge it and just repeats her indirect complaint.

 she's so inhuman and cold at times that I swear to you. How can someone be so intensely cold and senseless for her own child?

8) whenever someone comes home she starts acting like she's not taken care of. And she goes overboard in trying to show everyone how nice she is. Like asking someone if she should put the carpet on the floor for him. But in reality she hasn't taken any responsibility in life. She doesn't even know how to peel a fruit, or boil an egg or even toast a bread. This isn't memory related. She truly doesn't know these things until my mom teaches her.

The weird thing is I'm actually the happiest I have been in a long time. I have good friends and support networks around me which I was missing for so long, as well as a partner who I know loves and supports me no matter what. I had a traumatic childhood which hit 9 out of 10 ACE scores and subsequently I can't remember a whole lot about my childhood, probably for that reason. I get flashes of memories, that's it. I guess my concern is that these feelings are following something that's been repressed as it doesn't seem to follow the clear-cut diagnostic criteria for things like Generalised Anxiety Disorder or Depression. However, I'm highly sceptical by nature and I don't know if I even believe in the validity of repressed memories considering the research seems to suggest they are highly suggestible.   


Does anyone know of anything that this could be following?  Dr Google has been extremely unhelpful as nothing I have found seems to follow these two phenomena :/",13Apr2019,1

75,"22 years old here.
I suffer from anxiety, social anxiety, and depression. Every day I deal with anxiety and these thoughts in my head that every thing is going to go bad and everyone is thinking about me in a negative way. I’m a burden to those around me. I hate going places because I think that everyone is looking at me and thinking negatively of me. I have low self esteem. I’m not confident in myself. I worry I won’t do anything right after college. I’m insecure. The amount of days and nights, hours on end staying up crying my eyes out to the thoughts of I’m worthless, no one wants to be friends with me, they just are because I’m a twin and it would be rude to leave me out, I don’t get invited anywhere without my twin there, it’s not his fault, I wouldn’t blame him for that. When I’m around my friends I feel out of place and not included, as if I shouldn’t be there. I was bullied in middle school and it always scarred me. I sweat easily, not when I’m nervous, just from genetics, instant social anxiety that everyone is judging me and thinking what’s wrong with him. I’ve self harmed when it gets numb just to feel something. I’ve thought of suicide but never thought I would do it. If I had one wish in this world I wouldn’t spend it on money, fame, or anything materialistic. I would wish that every ounce of depression and anxiousness could be gone forever so I could live normally. I’ve been to therapy twice and both times all I was told was to try breathing exercises and meditate. Has not been effective. I don’t want to get on meds and become reliant on them. I want to be okay, I know so many people out there suffering as well, it fucking sucks. I want to be better.",13Apr2019,5

First off - sorry if I’m posting in the wrong spot! I’m new here :) if it is, kindly point me in the right direction of where I should post this!

I have recently decided to look for help with one specific issue that I’ve been struggling with the last few weeks. However when I spoke to the therapist/counselor/whatever on the phone they did say they were full and may have an opening in a couple of weeks. In the time since that phone call I have pretty much decided I am fine with that (despite contacting others) and now am coming to realize maybe there is a ton of other things that I could use some help with in life (stress, anger, anxiety, other issues that I have pushed down into a bottle and buried deep inside). Now I’m not sure in which direction to look for help with ALL of it. Not just one specific thing.

80,"I’m going to a residential treatment facility for my PTSD next week. My husband and I have not told our daughter yet. She’s eight, and I have been a stay-at-home mom for her entire life. Although I have always been very open with her that “Mommy gets scared and sad some times” I’m afraid of how being gone for a month is going to impact her. She is very bright, but also very sensitive, and we have a close relationship.

I tried doing a search for ways to tell your child you’re going to rehab, but a lot of the language doesn’t apply to my situation (“Encourage your child to think of a time they wanted something so badly, but couldn’t have it, so that they can understand that that is how addiction feels for you” in example) and would probably be more confusing than helpful. 

Can anyone recommend books that might help a child understand that a parent going away doesn’t mean they are being abandoned, that maybe isn’t specific to rehab? Or just strategies about how to talk to her in general? My husband and I have a good support system of far-away friends who have already volunteered to send her mail “from me”—she loves getting mail—and local friends who will be helping my husband with her day-to-day life and keeping her busy. We are planning on talking to her tomorrow night with her godparents and my father to reinforce the idea that just because I’ll be going away for a while, she’ll still have Daddy, Poppa, Uncle T and Aunt Sari.

81,"I'm 20M and my 12 year old brother has autism and psychosis. Our dad lives in Greece and doesn't want any contact with us, and our mom and step dad basically just ignore my brother when he's having mental health episodes and problems at school. They go out drinking almost night and leave him alone. Their house is disgusting with mold and crap everywhere because they never clean anything.

CPS noted their problems in a report, and they fixed them for like a month. Our mom and step dad told my brother that he's not welcome at home again if he ever tells anyone anything bad about them again. My brother is so terrified of abandonment that he just complies with every authority figure now and doesn't want to have his own opinions heard.

My brother's level of disability is severe according to his doctor. He's almost completely nonverbal. He writes very vivid, imaginative stories, but he can't sound out words to read anything aloud or understand people unless they talk slow enough for him to slowly break apart and visualize every syllable in his mind. 
My mom yells at him and refuses to accommodate his language deficit.

My brother is also amazing at math. He understands everything I'm learning as a physics major and does calculus problems for fun. But our mom insists he sit in a special Ed classroom and learn arithmetic with children who have Down syndrome. His teachers also claim he can't understand the books he wants to read and take them away. He's at a severe disadvantage because he has to sit down at a computer and slowly hunt and peck on the keyboard to write what he wants to tell them. He finds it so frustrating to try to communicate with his teachers who think he's stupid that he gives up and goes along with it. Between the bullies and bad teachers, he hates school and throws tantrums about having to go some days, and our mom abuses him in response.

He has episodes of psychosis where he believes black clouds are swirling around him and hands are coming out of the floor to claw his skin off. If he's very stressed, he gets those episodes even if he takes his meds. Our mom is of course out drinking while he's home alone scared out of his mind. She thinks he's alright alone because he takes care of himself when she's watching him.

I've had him come and stay with me several times, and he likes Chicago. The problem is that I'm in college with three other roommates and I'm poor. He can't stay with me forever. I would file for custody if I could, but I think what really needs to happen is that our mom needs to get it together like she's supposed to.",13Apr2019,11

83,"yeah...well, my life suddenly makes a whole lot more sense lol &gt;.&lt;

Haven't told anyone yet because I'm terrified they'll hate me and run away (go figure! Lol....). I've pretty much destroyed every relationship I've ever been in due to how unstable I am. Had a few suicide attempts, huge issues with alcohol abuse, eating disorders, severe anger problems, paranoid delusions, etc, etc, etc...

My family has always been kind of terrified of me due to how unstable I am, and I've basically cut them out of my life in order to survive. I don't have any friends anymore other than one or two because I cut them all out because they ""hate me"" or ""I'm disgusting"" or ""they were lying to me and never liked me at all"", etc...

I really am down to only one good friend, and she's recent. She's really the only person I feel comfortable telling, but I am terrified she'd never look at me the same way again, and eventually would (yes , yes I know) abandon me. She's really the one who helped me understand I had something seriously wrong with me, even if I think she didn't realize it at the time. I'm just terrified if I tell her she'll look up how fucking disasterous personal relationships with BPD people can be, and cut her losses. She'll still be nice to me sure, but we'll never be close again. She might even see that BPD people attach themselves to new friends, thinking they're amazing and incredible, their ""best friend""...only to later do the emotional equivalent of dousing them with kerosene and lighting them on fire for no other reason than I woke up that day. 

I just don't know what to do. Knowing now, with clinical certainty, that my brain is actively trying to destroy me I honestly have no idea whether or not these feelings have any basis in reality.

84,"I'm 27M, and I've been depressed and completely socially isolated for a year and a half. I got fired and had to declare bankruptcy due to medical bills, and my grandmother claims that I almost killed her from stress because I couldn't pay a student loan that she co-signed. I've messed up on so many things and the guilt has overwhelmed me to the point where I can't even stay afloat.

I look at myself in the mirror, 10 pounds overweight with no social skills, and I just feel hopeless. I'd rather remain alone than try to connect with anyone who is just going to hate me anyway.

I keep getting a lot of strange thoughts that are common in schizophrenia, and I'm wondering if I might have it now. 

Examples: I know that psychic abilities are fictional and impossible, but I still sometimes try to implant thoughts in other people's heads. Or the converse, I'll be anxious and thinking about something I don't want anyone else to know and be worried people I walk by can read my mind.

I was looking up things about illegal drugs and how people find dealers just out of curiosity, and I got very afraid that I was going to get arrested and have my phone and computer seized by the police, which are my lifelines. I tend to have a bias toward thinking law enforcement is omnipresent and reads through all my search history and posts I make online even though I know that is unlikely. 

I sometimes imagine a friend who died 5 years ago, and I think to myself that I caused his suicide and have conversations with him in my head. I don't believe in ghosts or spirits, but I feel like he's actually talking to me in the moment.

I was in Walmart and heard a weird, garbled voice coming out of the loudspeakers in the ceiling, and it continued for 3 minute or so . It sounded like someone was deliberately distorting his voice like you sometimes hear on news programs where an individual doesn't want his identity revealed. I couldn't understand anything he was saying, but I thought it was so weird. I'm questioning whether it was real and what the purpose would be if it was. I was like one of four people in the store early in the morning, so I couldn't exactly look around to see if other people were confused by it.",13Apr2019,2

88,"I have a history of mental illness. I had been hospitalized 4 times throughout my pre-teen and teen years, but I haven't been to a hospital in a while now. My father had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, he was diagnosed with the kind where mood changes are a lot quicker. I forget what the exact term was, but he also had a heat stroke and my mom claims apparently his bipolar disorder only got worse (faster mood changes) after that. I have never been formally diagnosed with disorders aside from PTSD from childhood abuse, anxiety and depression. I do doubt the depression diagnosis though for a few reasons but the most compelling reason is because I have been unmedicated and out of therapy for 3 years now and I haven't had a bout of depression (or mania) that entire time. I have been doing well overall. I have some trouble holding a job down so I have job hopped a bit but other than that I'm fairly healthy. I eat enough, try to sleep enough, pay my bills and socialize. The only thing that is really hurting me is my anxiety. It leads to arguments between my SO and I, my family, it indirectly led to me leaving two of my jobs and in general it just weighs on me. I was talking to my SO about my past and I told him about a time in my life where I had a weird behavior keep popping up where I was convinced certain new people I met were other people I already knew on disguise. This only was an issue during the worst times of my life (in and out of hospitals) but I'm very embarrassed about it. There were 5 people in total I had suspicions about, and one of them I ended up confiding in about it. I didn't get a good reaction, part of me thinks they thought I was being edgy and they made it clear they thought I was being weird so I stopped. The other day I met a new security guard at the front desk of my job and it ended up happening again. It's not like I get obsessed about it and it drives me insane but it just makes me feel insane. In the past I used to almost enjoy it because the ""disguised"" people were those I cared about most in my life and it made me feel comfortable in the hospital during my recovery. But now it's been years and it just scares me having this come up while my life is generally going well. My SO tries to reassure me it's anxiety just manifested as paranoia. I want to believe that's the case but I also need to make sure I don't fall down the rabbit hole I did when I was younger. When I was 14 my therapist said I seem like a very paranoid person, I used to always think that if someone was being nice to me there was a reason and it was almost always a bad reason. I used to not let people walk behind me or hug me, used to jump to conclusions, shower with the curtains open- you get the idea. Then again I had been diagnosed with PTSD so I really don't want to assume those past ""indicators"" were just symptoms of PTSD. I have no other symptoms of schizophrenia and people even say I'm like a ball of sunshine now. I can express and feel emotions very well and I haven't been medicated or gone to therapy in years so I may just be overthinking but is this something that warrants a visit to a doctor? I don't have health insurance so I don't want to waste my money if I'm going to be told it's just anxiety again. Thanks in advance",13Apr2019,1

90,"Hello. I just got back to reddit and the first thing I tried to look for is a subreddit that can maybe help a little? I am not sure why I am doing this. I also am not exactly sure about what I am feeling at the moment or what I am going to do next. I am sitting on my bed just trying to compose this so it would make sense. I hope it will.

The thing is I am confused about what is happening to me right now. I mean I have an idea but I don't know if I can fully grasp it. This is going to be long so I am sorry for that. 

I am a teacher and I have been teaching for four years now. My first year was fine. Not what I expected but it wasn't too bad. It made me question my career choice though. Like is this really for me? I changed schools and the second year was the best. I had great students, the workload was easy and I feel appreciated. The third year was a bit of a downer. There were a lot of problems with my classes and it made me out of order for lack of a better term. 

The real issues started during my fourth year. I was given a tough class and it just made me give up. I lost motivation to do work stuff. Every day in school makes it feel like I am carrying this heavy stone on my back. I still get happy, of course, but it is just not the same as before. The moment I wake up every day, I wish I am back home soon. I stopped being productive. I let go of hobbies that I loved doing before. I can't hold my concentration long enough to finish a chapter of a book which is so not me! I finish a whole book in one sitting back in the day! It is weird because I don't understand. Why am I like this now? Why can't I do what I know and love?

Halfway through the school year, I decided that I want to quit my job. But I didn't. I need the money. I just kept telling myself that I will just resign and not come back next school year. 

I should be happy, right? I laid out plans, even though they are incomplete. Like what I said, I am not sure what am I going to do next and the thing is, i don't want to think about what I want to do next. I just want to shut down my brain, not think about anything for a while. I feel like if I do that, I will be able to reset myself. Will that happen? I am not sure.

The past months I felt the need to seek attention, to have someone who cares. This is actually the first time I talk about what I feel to this extent. I complain a lot but I am the type of person who listens to my friend's problems, console them, complain a little about my problems but never really go deep with those cause I feel like I am just being a bother. Even typing all this makes me feel like I will be a bother to people here. 

I have never sought professional help cause I can't afford one. Our school doesn't really do much to topics like the mental health of their employees.

99,"So, my ex girlfriend of one year broken up with me about two weeks ago. Kinda sad but that’s really not the issue here. I’m over that. What I’m more concerned about is her mental health. During the duration of our relationship, she got sad quite often and she said she’s been suffering from depression and anxiety for over 5 years (started at around age 11-12) and she’s been hospitalized twice. (once while we were together) She would constantly say sorry for getting sad all the time and “stressing me out” but in reality I was okay with it and I wouldn’t let that hinder our relationship because I loved her a lot. I would constantly reassure her that her mental health wasn’t taking a toll on me and I was doing okay. I would tell her that I would do everything in my power to make her feel safe and happy in this world and bring her back on her feet so we can continue what we called “our road to a long happy life.” We were walking in the park one day and she broke down crying for what seemed like no apparent reason. I hugged her and kisses her and did what I could to comfort her. She then asked me if we could take a short break so she could sort out her mental health and get her life in track because she believed that she could not see a happy future together with her problems and all the things going on in her life at the time. I agreed and I suggested some things she could do while on her “break” like consistent exercise, journaling, yoga and all that jazz. She took it into consideration and she had a bright smile on her face, ready to take on the world. My smile widened as well as I realized she was taking a step in the right direction in tackling her mental health. After that day she takes a few days off to get herself together, or so I thought. After only three or four days of not texting or communicating in any way, she texts me saying she’s been thinking a lot and she’s decided she’s not ready for a committed relationship. I’m saddened by this but it’s for the sake of her mental health so I agree. We agreed to remain friends though. After being friends for a while, I feel as if she’s just let herself go, not caring about her mental health whatsoever. She’s been sadder than usual on social media and I feel as if she let me go because she didn’t want to “disappoint” me anymore, which she wasn’t. And to add to this she was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder, on top of her depression and anxiety. After that point, she’s put in little to no effort into tackling her mental health. I was talking to her just yesterday and she was talking about her going down a “bad path” recently and after getting her to elaborate a little more, she wouldn’t budge and gave me little information as to what she meant, saying she has little care and respect for herself and she doesn’t have much longer if she continues this path. I gave her advice and suggested she goes down another path, but I felt as if my advice was thrown in the garbage as all she said was “Idk I’m just a mess.” I want to help her so badly. I’ve already accepted the fact that we’re no longer in a relationship and we’re just friends, but I still care a whole lot about her despite that and I want to do something to help her.

I never felt since the beginning that I fit in with other gay men. I was ostracized and put down because I didn't look a certain way, act a certain way, dress a certain way, etc. I have found gay men to be some of the most pompous, narcassitic, entitled and superficial humans on this planet. It's amazing that a group of people who cry so much about acceptance and are hell bent on it can't even accept or be nice to members of their own community.

So as a result, I am 29, have never had a relationship, have no gay friends and have barely dated because I can't meet any truly down to earth gay men that will give me a chance and not put me down for every little thing, or aren't condescending and rip me apart because I'm not this picture perfect magazine model that meets their superficial needs. Any other atgempt to get to know someone resulted in them leading me on onky for them yo fallmoff the face of the earth in pursuit of something better. (I can't even begin to tell you how many times that happened, its like a sickening number). Like all my straight friends have gotten married and drifted off so I can't connect with them anymore because they are in a different phase of their life and clearly I don't connect with gay men so I feel so lost and my self esteem has plummeted.

This whole experience has made me bitter, and downright angry. I can honestly say I hate gay men and I hate the way they have made me feel, like I'm an outcast and not worthy enough. It's to the point if I'm even watching tv or in public and see a gay man or anything LGBTQ related I get a visceral reaction and immediately just wanna attack them and spit at them. 

I see a therapist and a psychiatrist and have been for years; my most recent therapist is an LGBT specific therapist and nothing is helping, not even remotely. Its just draining my wallet. No amount of ""coginitve restructuring"" and ""reframing my thought process"" is helping me. I'm just continuing to get more angry and the situation is getting worse. I feel like I could receive all the therapy in the world but it's going to have minimal effect because the therapy isn't doing anything to change the sitiation around me that's causing me to feel this way in the first place. It's like trying to do all types of therapy on a child who lives in an abusive household and expecting it to magically help them while they're still living there being subjected to the same abuse over and over. 

Idk what to do, what's the next step but I really feel I am on the verge of a meltdown and I'm afraid one day I am really going to explode and it isn't going to be pleasant. Any advice?",13Apr2019,1
101,"I'm in high school, and when I'm going to school I feel fine. There's work I need to do, and I have very little free time on a daily basis. But when I am actually free, (during breaks and weekends to a lesser extent), I have no motivation to do anything. I end up wasting hours and hours on my computer, just clicking through reddit mostly. Up until some time last year, I would just spend my free time playing video games and it was fine and a fun way to spend my time. But for some reason, I just got bored of all video games. A game can barely hold my attention for 30 mins before I feel zero motivation to keep playing it. It's after I got bored of games that I began to feel bored during my free time. So I've been searching for other things to do but I have no motivation to do them either. I managed to force myself to try learning programming but I get bored of that really easily too. While I'm hanging out with my friends it's alright, but I feel very little motivation to actually go out to hang out with them. This feeling is accompanied by a tightening in the chest somewhat. I think I feel anxious when I'm not doing anything, especially not doing something productive, but at the same time, I feel no motivation to do anything. I guess it is kind of like how you might feel when you are depressed, but I don't feel sad or hopeless.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm near the end of a week long spring break right now and this feeling has started to sink in after 5 days of not going to school. Despite how I feel right now, I'm sure that I'm going to be fine again when I start going to school again. Maybe I'm just a workaholic?  But I don't feel motivation to do random chores either. The longer I'm on break, the worse it gets. Winter break was especially rough and I think I almost felt depressed. I'm concerned for how summer break is going to go, so I'm desperately trying to find some sort of passion or interest before that. I do exercise, just not on a daily basis. I have a martial arts class I attend twice a week but maybe that's not enough. I also take violin lessons and earn some money tutoring middle schoolers. All this is great, but I just feel extremely listless in my free time, when I should be having fun.

I don’t know if I’m depressed because I don’t feel sad, I just don’t feel or care about anything. All my life I’ve been an A honor roll student with a 4.0 gpa but this semester my highest grade is a D and then mostly Fs because I just don’t care. My social life and relationships with friends and family has went to shit because I don’t feel like talking to anyone anymore, I’ve dropped most of my hobbies like the piano, hiking, and kayaking and just sit in my room all day. I almost feel bad for feeling this way because I’ve lived such a good life and nothing bad has really happened to me except things not working or with a girl whom I thought I loved and I still have to force myself to go to prom with her in a week, but it doesn’t seem like that’d be reason to just not give a shit about anything including my own life even though she is what’s usually on my mind 24/7. I don’t know if I need to get help or just force myself to continue living doing the bare minimum, I probably won’t get help though because just like pretty much everything right now I just don’t care enough to ask for help.

I was emotionally and psychologically crippled by my abusive mother and the disgusting things she forced me through when I was living with her, when I was five my parents separated and she had the genius idea of moving us to an undisclosed Grand Duchy in the heart of Europe where I was bullied in a very extreme manner by the people I met there both in school and out, my life became a perverse take on groundhog day where I would be awoken by the sound of my mother screaming at me, I would go to school and be both physically and psychologically abused by both teacher and student alike only to come home and receive the same treatment from this whore woman who was supposed to love me, the good days were the days she didn't come home reeking of alcohol or smacked out of her head, when we finally moved back to England when I was 12 I was already too far gone to successfully reintegrate and I quickly gave up on school and the notion of ever making friends, though the silver lining I guess was that being back in an English speaking school meant my pleas for help were actually being heard and CPS got involved almost immediately, my Father (who had been living in the UK all this time) was located and I was moved in with him only to find he was also a cowardly and abusive cunt of a human being with a replacement whore of a woman he called his girlfriend to boot, ergo him kicking me out at the ripe old age of 14, what should have been the most important years of my life instead are a blur where I very quickly took to drinking and the consumption of elicit drugs to cope with being homeless and later the utter psychological horrors of living in and out of supported housing at such a young age, I have had to do horrible things to myself and the people I've met along the way to survive and it's all left me feeling like an animal that doesn't belong.

106,"So just some quick background (I don’t know why I start off all of my posts like this) I was diagnosed with chronic social and general anxiety, OCD, mild ADHD and severe depression (you’ll see how all of these kind of play hand in hand in this situation). I’m in drama club and GSA (gay straight alliance), I struggled with bullying from the ages of five till now (but it’s not as severe as it was back then it’s mainly cyber bullying). I also call these mental breakdowns (which I’m pretty sure isn’t the exact term for it) because more than one of my disorders was sort of playing into it and was triggered by the situation and my normal panic attack symptoms weren’t coming out I was able to think but that thinking was hysterical. 


So this week was hectic it was the opening night for my play (we did Julius Caesar and the play was shown on Wednesday- Friday), it was day of silence (it’s a LGBT sort of event) and at the same time my narcolepsy was through the roof because I was stressed out(yes I do have narcolepsy and my main trigger is actually anxiety mainly revolving around social anxiety). In the play we have this one kid with high functioning autism, we try to include him and everyone can tell that he has autism. I’m in the first scene and he’s in the second and since our budget is so small we share costumes but since the scenes r changed so fast (literally five seconds) I can’t give him my costume in time and during rehearsal he would make this very obvious and stop the entire rehearsal to say he’s not ready, in that scene he has a small role in which he needs to just guide this girl across the stage, in the past he wouldn’t come to practice and so we would improvise and realized that it wasn’t that big of a deal but we still wanted him to be there. Since he has my costume afterwards in the scene my teacher kind of made him my responsibility (this is where it goes horribly wrong). 

I don’t know what happened during my scene but when I went backstage he was beyond angry, he was swearing and clenching his fist and the teachers weren’t back there so I simply kept my distance because this was causing my anxiety to kick in. He expected me to get him changed instead of just handing him my costume but I would help him with the shield and sword everything else involved actual like putting on and stuff and as a girl helping a guy I didn’t exactly feel comfortable in that situation being so close to someone like that. He wasn’t ready and started screaming to stop the play (luckily this was practice) and told them he wasn’t ready, one of the other kids got mad at me and scolded me for not helping him but I explained to her the situation afterwards and she knows how I struggle in situations where someone’s mad so we both agreed we need to find him a new costume. At this point the teachers were worrying about other things because the play was a mess(but luckily we were able to put on some amazing productions). While practicing curtain call they had put me with him(once again a bad decision). There’s obviously nothing wrong with having autism but I don’t think u should make another child take care of him instead u should probably have an adult who’s pretty well rounded with his situation. Opening night came around he was pissed throughout the entire play (I still don’t know why) and wouldn’t come out for curtain call on time. My mind was in fight or flight mode and for me it’s always the latter, because of this I had made a face (I actually don’t remember even making a face because I was too focused on other things) and that night I had a tiny mental breakdown because I realized I would have to go through that two more times and he anxiety of people yelling at me for his mistakes was getting to me. Second night comes around one of the teachers pulls me to the side cause of the facial expression I made and this is when the second mental breakdown comes in. She felt really bad because there I was crying and I kept saying “I’m fine but I’m actually not cause I’m never fine but it’s ok cause I’m fine” (I say things like this whenever I’m not around my family and I feel unsafe/ I’m panicking) there’s a senior who understands what I’m going through and she immediately took charge of the situation. I explained everything to her and so on. NOW here’s where the build up to the third breakdown happens.


This one is centered around my GSA club, the president is graduating soon and I wanted to run for president, whenever I would say I wanted to these three people (president, M1 and M2) would shut me down. I decided that this was going no where and took it to the teacher, all I asked was “are we going to have an election?” And he immediately said yeah and we started talking about future GSA plans. So back to my second break down I was talking to M2 and E and I had said that stress was sort of building up to that moment, in my frantic hazed situation I had said something like “yeah and GSA is kind of playing into this” and then M2 sort of interrogated me on it and I told her that I asked if there’s going to be an election and then she got defensive saying that’s going to be her and M1, I could tell that I had messed up and ran away from that, they were in bad moods he entire time. Third night of the play comes and M1 and M2 pull me outside and talk to me. In GSA I have B she understands everything and agrees with me that there should be an election, she also understands that I had drama in the past with my old group of friends which includes M1 and M2 but that I like to be civil and keep it in a confined group so it doesn’t spread and affect our clubs. (Oh yeah forgot to mention, B, M1 and M2 r all in drama and GSA) without B there I felt extremely uncomfortable because it was a 2 on 1 situation and both of them were angry, after a bit of yelling on their end and me trying to explain why an election should happen I had asked to have this conversation another time so it doesn’t affect drama club since it’s a GSA situation and should be talked about in GSA in a meeting not just the three of us because if it’s only us three then it turns into drama that’s not needed. I could also feel myself shaking and on the verge of tears but they wouldn’t drop it so I just ended it and said “no bye” they were pissed. I had pulled the senior who helped me on the second night outside and I explained what happened because she was worried since I came in shaking and looking both angry and depressed. At that point I broke down and it was bad, B came around and saw me and both her and the senior went into defense mode and said that that’s basically bullying what they did to me. After the play I got a text from M2 saying things like I had called them bullies and such, I didn’t know what they were talking about and apparently B was talking to another person about what happened and that they called them bullies. 

In the end everything was semi fixed, I wasn’t in curtain call with the guy anymore, he’s not going to be in the play because he was making others feel unsafe(I felt bad because of that because like I said high functioning autism but at the same time it was like a mine field during the entire play around him). The GSA thing is still a problem and I’m just taking everything to the teacher now. The senior gave me a stuffed animal named Lenny to hold onto till Monday because I wouldn’t let Lenny go on the last day and it was really comforting me (Lenny also smells really nice which is extremely comforting). 

Also to explain how all of my disorders played into each other. It would start off with my social anxiety from those situations, then it would lead into my general anxiety and OCD and I basically had this mindset that the entire play was going to go horribly wrong. After my mental breakdowns my ADHD would kick in and I was basically in this euphoric jokester phase where I was smiling but then my severe depression came in and anything I said was extremely depressing which includes “I’m not fine, I’m never fine and that’s ok but it’s not cause I’m not ok but don’t worry I just had a mental breakdown so I should be good but I’m not” and “holy shit I feel like shit I don’t think I should be alive but I gotta be for this play, why is everything going so bad” and so on. The hyperactivity from the ADHD was making me seem happy and was sort of canceling out the depression. So yeah, I’m actually fine now I’m in this phase where I know on Monday the whole GSA thing is going to go extremely wrong and I’m just trying to savor these moments in which I can actually enjoy being mentally stable for a bit. Thank god I did therapy and had the senior and B there, in the past I would’ve attempted and I would’ve gone into an even worse place but right now I’m content with life and I’m living it one day at a time instead of focusing on the things going wrong :).",13Apr2019,1
107,"So after having 3 mental breakdowns this past week (I really don’t know if that’s what I should call them, some people would tell me those are nervous breakdowns or panic attacks but to me I label it as mental breakdown it just feels right) I talked to my therapist about what happened. I explained to her that afterwards I felt a lot like my brain was hazy and I couldn’t control my body but that I was jumping around, smiling and joking around sort of like a child but what I was saying was something a child would not say it was really depressing things. She explained to me that what I was going through is similar to dissociating after I went into thorough details on what was going on and how I literally wasn’t thinking I was just acting impulsively. Right now I’m regretting everything I did sort of like ur drunk and ur doing dumb stuff and the next day u remember what u did. My friends who helped me through these breakdowns were pretty understanding though but they didn’t even know what to do they just laughed and smiled with me and made sure to stay around me the entire time. I’m pretty sure I was still freaking out on the inside but on the outside I acted carefree. I mean does anybody else go through this? To me it’s kind of creepy because one minute I’m crying my eyes out and freaking out and the next I’m smiling and dancing (I forgot what it was called but it’s like ur turning ur legs and feet and u keep rocking back and forth while ur turning ur upper half in a different direction).",13Apr2019,1

Hi all, 

My name Aimee, I am a trainee clinical psychologist passionate about learning more about peoples experience of hearing voices. I am completing my research on exploring predictive factors of voice hearing distress and loneliness. LINK:[https://livpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_0PAIG9hNgxDlVfn](https://livpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0PAIG9hNgxDlVfn)

**Hearing voices is a relatively common and normal experience.** I am interested in learning more about how people feel about their voices and the beliefs they hold about them. The study will also ask about childhood adverse experiences, mindfulness of voices and emotion regulation. It is important you are aware that for some people answering questions about their early childhood may be distressing ( support numbers are provided at the start and end of the research survey).

All participants have the chance to be entered in to a prize draw where you could win 1 of 6 £25.00 Amazon vouchers.

If you have any questions regarding the research my email address can be found on the information sheet at the start of the research questions.

I was diagnosed with PDD-NOS (aspergers that isn't quite like aspergers - already an iffy vague diagnosis) when I was about 5. I eventually began talking to myself a lot, having mostly auditory hallucinations, and over the last decade my above average schizophrenia developed into very severe schizophrenia. I'm going to see a doctor this summer.

I'm also a Two Spirit trans person. I'm kind of overweight but working on it. I'm a social person but awkward and I don't function at all in loud, impersonal environments. I've never had any sort of relation, barely any friends, very lethargic. I really am kind of mean sometimes though I really don't mean it. I refuse to ever have sex unless I adore somebody because it repulses me.

All this together just makes me feel that I'm going to die alone. Like, so much of this stuff already repulses people, but paranoid schizophrenia too?

This is probably gonna be a long one, Im gonna be as detailed as I can. Also English isnt my main language. Im sorry if I repeat something, this is something that I dont know how to handle. 

Bit of backgroud of what my life was like before the memory. 
 My mom always threatened to leave us for some reason, she would usually fight with dad about it at nights and me and my sister would beg her to stay, she never left, this happened many times when I was 4-8 I think, I dont have many memories from that time. 
 My parents divorced when I was around 8, it was very hard for me, my dad blamed mom, he didnt like her new man, dad always used to say moms guy friend is a liar and traitor for breaking our family, I was always very conflicted who's side I should be on, moms or dads. Mom was a big guilt tripper, and loves to play a victim and she still is. Probably has bpd, and I got bpd too. She always has crossed my personal boundaries a lot, havent talked to her for couple years. Also for the first years I was afraid to sleep at moms place because I was scared she would leave us. 
 Dad is that stereotypical tough man, doesnt really talk about feelings, I've never seen him cry. I think some of my issues are because of him, I crave attention from men, I like them older, I'm very submissive ja have some interesting kinks, I think all that is because of dad and this one memory, it's so weird, makes me ashamed and disgusted.
 So the memory. At one point dad had a girlfriend, I dont remember how long they were together, I remember only few things from that time, I believe I was around 10 years old. So I never liked her, she was kinda weirdly sexual? When she was playing with us kids we would listen to music and there was this one song that was about sex and she would always say how she liked that song. It made me so uncomfortable and I was ashamed cuz I really didnt know why. I did know what sex was, well anyway. I remember once when she was seeing dad I really didnt want her to be there, I guess I was scared she would take dad away from us. Well she was staying for the night, I wanted to sleep next to dad because I didnt like her and I wanted my dads attention or something. Then I forced myself to stay awake and told dad I cant sleep and stuff like that to make sure he would stay? Anyway I dont know how much time had passed. She didnt really like my me being there and I remember her climbing on top if dad and saying something I dont remember what, but I didnt like it. I think she knew I was awake. Anyway bit after that the went in the livingroom, I could hear them talking, I dont remember much of it, one thing I remember she was telling my dad how she punched her exhusband and laughed because police didnt believe him, because she is such a small woman. I think she had issues with alcohol, and I remember her and my dad had been drinking that night. I remember when I was listening them the whole time and thinking I wanted to go there and stop them or get dads attention away from her. But then I hear they started having sex, I was in dads room and they were on the sofa in the livingroom, I was standing and quickly went back to bed, I dont know what that made me feel, but I just had to hear everything but I think I fell asleep I dont know, 
 I dont remember the next day. I dont remember a lot, but that memory, it makes me feel weird, ashamed, I dont know what I should think about it, it makes me feel weird. Also dad and her broke up, I told dad I didnt like her, but I dont know what was the reason for their break up.
 I dont know why I am like this, why this makes me think about killing myself, its like it haunts me. This is not the only weird memory I have, I have a lot things I question, like am I allowed to feel these feelings about this, and what is this even, what happened to me really?
 One other memory Ive recently remembered too, I was around 11 I think, I had just gotten my first bra and panties, my mom got them for me and I was trying them on, I was really happy about them, showing them to my mom and stuff, then she asks if I wanted to show them to her guyfriend (they are still together btw, married) so yeah 11 year old me wanted to show them and I did, to me this just seems wrong.
 I have a lot of bad memories from my childhood but I feel like none if them are bad enough, like I shouldnt be this traumatised, but I am.

I dont know what's the point of this, but I needed to get it out, I need to know if Im allowed to have these feelings.",13Apr2019,1

121,"I can't stop thinking about:

**- where does my consciousness come from?**

**- how do I know my world is real?**

I think about this 10-20 times a day for about 10 minutes each time. It always leaves depressed and fearful that something bad is happening to me in the real world (matrix style) that I can't control.

123,"I was recently diagnosed with depression. After three years of having suicidal episodes and having trouble at school when I started high school I decided to speak to my counsellor about it because it was greatly affecting my school performance. At first I wasn’t sure how a diagnosis would affect the way I thought about myself and my out look on things, but sometimes I don’t feel like I have depression. I’m convinced that the way I feel is the normal course of human emotion and that this is normal, until I put it in a way where.. I want to hurt myself every day, or at every inconvenience, and my relationships with everyone close to me has slowly deteriorated, and my interest in life itself. 

I grew up fine. I have no traumas that could be the root of my depression. My parents are separated, but they are loving and understanding and aware. My older sister, who accounts for a lot of my maturity, is one of the strongest things in my support system. I’ve grown up comfortably and stable. I’m self aware and practice healthier thinking, and try to process my emotions and thoughts in best ways possible, I stopped drinking ,I stopped self harming and everything- but I still feel this way. I still want to sink into the floor and isolate myself and I still feel so small and trapped within my body. The way I would describe it is like a conscious, emotional version of sleep paralysis. It frustrates me insanely and I feel so horrible for the people around me and I don’t ever want them to feel like the things they do for me are taken for granted when I return to my old ways and when I become recluse or am devoid of emotion in response to their offerings of love. 

As for the paranoia and moodiness, when I started feeling down and out I started off being very unresponsive to things that bothered me. I had no reaction and I let things pass if they upset me normally, paid no mind etc. even if something genuinely hurt me it was okay, because no one ever intends to hurt my feelings. I used to react very badly, but now it takes too much energy to react. However when something pushes me too far or I get overwhelmed I completely explode and panic and cry if I’m unable to remove myself from the situation (eg family wanting to talk to me and having to face consequences for my actions, and I have to stay when I ask if I can leave) and it builds up and I get the harrowing urge to harm myself or just leave everything completely. I completely shut down and walk away because it’s a better reaction than having to explode and take it out on other people or hurt my family. (Not physically).
I noticed that when my mental health deteriorated, I would get more and more paranoid and easily afraid of things. Like at night time, or I’d hear and see things like shadowy people in the corner of my eye or something/someone speaking to me. It’s difficult to see scary/gory/creepy things that would normally entertain me. Things overwhelm me very easily.

I do things to try and help. I picked up skateboarding, i draw, I opened up to the people closest to me. I make plans and go out with my friends. I am honest with the people who ask, because no one ever does. I have hopes and dreams. I am afraid of how this will affect my school life and thus my future career and such. I’m only 16, and I’ve got such a long way to go, but I’m at a stage where I will have to start making bigger decisions with my life but it just feels like too much to do. It’s painful, and I know it will pass because I always have, but the thought that no matter how much it grows and shrinks every time it still looms over me and sits upon my shoulders fucks me up. I hate that I’ll never be able to run away from it or avoid it. It feels like too much to do, or too much that I can bare. I just feel tired and disconnected all the time. 

I’m not too sure where I was going with this post, but I am grateful for the platform reddit has offered for me to be able to express how I feel when I can’t get that in real life. If you’ve read this entire post, thank you so much for doing so. I don’t think there are any answers to depression sometimes. I guess the little things that I do still matter and still make the slightest of difference, even when I feel like they’re nothing. It’s just very exhausting sometimes, but I hope it is all worth it one day.",13Apr2019,1

127,"My grandma has gone through a lot, and it’s recently been really catching up to her. She lost her husband, my grandpa, about a half a decade ago, and still lives alone in their giant old house. All of her pets have since died, and she spends the majority of time by herself watching tv. She doesn’t get out much other than family events, and recently, she hasn’t even been attending many of those. When we saw her a week ago, she seemed much skinnier and less stable on her feet, so my dad went with her to the doctor to run some tests (she definitely wouldn’t go herself). The test results came back with quite a few problems (From her teen years to adulthood she was a smoker, which is presenting itself now with breathing and heart problems) but nothing she has is immediately threatening to her health. This really scares her though, along with the fact that my grandfather from my mother’s side just recently passed, and we assume that’s why she’s been going out less and less.

I love my grandma so much and I hate to see her so isolated and afraid. I know that ultimately, her outlook on her life and what she choses to do is up to her, but if I can do anything to show her that she still has a purpose in the present, I will. 

Starting now I want to call her each weekend and talk to her. I know she probably wouldn’t have much to say  if I ask her about her day or what she’s been doing for the past week, because she doesn’t get out much. I want it to be something she can look forward to and be able to actively participate in. Maybe a game or something? I want to know what she truly wants from her life and about her interests and hobbies. I want her to know she still has so much left to give to the world. But I’m in a rut. I really want this to work. If there anything you can think of that would make this idea work? Any topics, games, questions, activities, etc.? Maybe just advice on how to help her in general? Whatever it may be, I would really, really appreciate it :,)",13Apr2019,1
